this is for employers only is it good to is it good for a potential employee to send a thank you letter after an interview does it sway your decision to hire them at all for instance. If you interview two people with the same qualifications and skill level and one send a thank you letter and the other doesn't whom are you more likely to hire also does it seem to desperate or you find it flattering i'm asking because i interviewed for a position that was my dream job. I sent them a thank you letter to let them know that i appreciated the opportunity to interview i don't want to necessarily sway them but i want them to know that i am really interested and would work really hard for them i am hoping that they will see that i am sincere and really want the opportunity to show them what i can do is that bad when i went on the interview. I know i sold myself but since i know that they probaly conducted many interviews i thought that writing them a thank you would put a fresh mark in their minds that i am still out there they told me i was at the top of their list i'm sure they haven't forgotten i just wanted to be nice and say thank you i was truly blessed to even have the opportunity to interview for these people as an employer a thank you note would be a nice touch if i had two or three people running close for the position and one sent a thank you note i wouldn't say it would make me hire them but it would make me keep them in the front of mind just because like you said its a little reminder of who you are good luck to you  New York Giants Time Out of Mind Theory of conduct Social rule Milton H.

Construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser, while construction typically takes place on location for a known client. Construction as an industry comprises six to nine percent of the gross domestic product of developed countries. Construction starts with planning,[citation needed] design, and financing and continues until the project is built and ready for use.Large-scale construction requires collaboration across multiple disciplines. An architect normally manages the job, and a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project manager supervises it. For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential. Those involved with the design and execution of the infrastructure in question must consider zoning requirements, the environmental impact of the job, the successful scheduling, budgeting, construction-site safety, availability and transportation of building materials, logistics, inconvenience to the public caused by construction delays and bidding, etc. The largest construction projects are referred to as megaprojects.In general, there are three sectors of construction: buildings, infrastructure and industrial. Building construction is usually further divided into residential and non-residential (commercial/institutional). Infrastructure is often called heavy/highway, heavy civil or heavy engineering. It includes large public works, dams, bridges, highways, water/wastewater and utility distribution. Industrial includes refineries, process chemical, power generation, mills and manufacturing plants. There are other ways to break the industry into sectors or markets.Engineering News-Record (ENR) is a trade magazine for the construction industry. Each year, ENR compiles and reports on data about the size of design and construction companies. They publish a list of the largest companies in the United States (Top-40) and also a list the largest global firms (Top-250, by amount of work they are doing outside their home country). In 2014, ENR compiled the data in nine market segments. It was divided as transportation, petroleum, buildings, power, industrial, water, manufacturing, sewer/waste, telecom, hazardous waste plus a tenth category for other projects. In their reporting on the Top 400, they used data on transportation, sewer, hazardous waste and water to rank firms as heavy contractors.The Standard Industrial Classification and the newer North American Industry Classification System have a classification system for companies that perform or otherwise engage in construction. To recognize the differences of companies in this sector, it is divided into three subsectors: building construction, heavy and civil engineering construction, and specialty trade contractors. There are also categories for construction service firms (e.g., engineering, architecture) and construction secrs (firms engaged in managing construction projects without assuming direct financial responsibility for completion of the construction project)Building construction is the process of adding structure to real property or construction of buildings. The majority of building construction jobs are small renovations, such as addition of a room, or renovation of a bathroom. Often, the owner of the property acts as laborer, paymaster, and design team for the entire project. Although building construction projects typically include various common elements, such as design, financial, estimating and legal considerations, many projects of varying sizes reach undesirable end results, such as structural collapse, cost overruns, and/or litigation. For this reason, those with experience in the field make detailed plans and maintain careful oversight during the project to ensure a positive outcome.
