handspeed anyone got any advice on how to make ur hands quicker and faster simple try when shadow boxing using hand weights not to heavy though depending on your size and weight use a weight that is comfortable for you and isn't too heavy this will increase the muscle needed in those certain areas that people never work out when just straight lifting also try getting a double end bag this will not only help you with your speed but it will also with your accuracy and eye coordination so that way in the end when you gain that speed you will have the means necessary to put that speed to work try hitting it with bigger gloves than you would use in sparing or an actual fight but also use your normal size that way you perfect your timing and accuracy while with the bigger gloves working your speed and stamina endurance make sure you stretch your arms real good before you attempt these exercises and routines keeps your ligaments and tendons from tightening up on you there for leading to you getting cramps also when you hit the heavy bag try hitting it with heavier gloves than what you would wear in a spar bout this will increase your speed definitely minute rounds on the heavy bag with minute rest in between try to go for at least rounds with the bag then rest for about minutes put on your normal gloves and get ready to spar or shadow i promise you will fill the difference in your speed and if you make this a regular routine you will eventually find out how fast you have become with the bigger gloves and your stamina will be at an all time high good luck and just try this for about a month straight this will induce a great amount of speed if kept up  Equine conformation Boxing Weight training Boxing training Mattress Muay Thai Internal ballistics Sailing Ammunition Messerschmitt Bf 109 Volleyball Professional wrestling holds Mixed martial arts CPU design CPU cache RISC Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Wind turbine Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Archery Radio controlled airplane Shen Gong Wu Poker jargon Dance Dance Revolution Hipparchus (astronomer) Table tennis RuneScape skills Heinkel He 112 Shotgun Car handling Diving Skateboarding trick Osteoarthritis Enzyme The Contender (television series) Pump It Up Carpal tunnel syndrome Drill bit Paintball Urinary incontinence Andr__s Galarraga M60 machine gun Guilty Gear 24 Hours of Le Mans Ben Johnson (athlete) Krag-J__rgensen Baseball Stars Puberty Tank classification Climbing equipment Strap-on dildo Drag racing M16 (rifle) Items in the Metroid series Suicide methods Professional wrestling match types Breaststroke Wood carving Golf club (equipment) Iowa class battleship Motorcycle TGV GunZ The Duel Brassiere Betting (poker) Messerschmitt Me 163 Golf Airsoft Handloading Professional wrestling slang DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Mario Kart 64 Speed of light New York Giants Massage Martial art Dieting Tom Richardson Armored Core Aerial (dance move) Swimming Roy Jones Jr. Field hockey Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Terminal ballistics Douglas DC-8 Gravity Arado Ar 80 Muscle Diablo II: Lord of Destruction 2005 Belgian Grand Prix

gypsy holyfield a young lady just stated that evander was the only tough fighter in the heavyweight division in the last years what is your thought on this statement thanks terrence for asking me a question there have been a few tough ones mainly frazier but none of them including frazier would look at anyone or anything and not be scared like holyfield my grandpa was the light heavyweight champion of his marine division and was on the first marine wave at guadalcanal my dad was also a great boxer in the air force but lost the division semi finals he was a re con photographer in vietnam he also beat the crap out of race car driver bobby unser in a bar fight in albuquerque my grandpa's two brothers were state wrestling champions in oklahoma and oklahoma has the best wrestlers there are look it up my cousin pat almost won the first toughman contest for oklahoma in the late 's a lot of other relatives have won some minor golden gloves stuff as well i think i know a little about fighting i think you wish that you knew as much and had seen as much as i have i grew up listening to dad and grandad they both said nobody could whup joe louis they said cassius clay ali would get ripped to shreds by marciano dad watched evander holyfield and said he was the toughest guy he had seen in so many years so put that in your pipe and smoke it boys  Boxing Mike Tyson George Foreman Jersey Joe Walcott Joe Frazier Michael Moorer Lou Duva Indianapolis 500 Ring Magazine fighters of the year Joe Louis Chris Byrd John Ruiz Bob Foster Larry Holmes Roy Jones Jr. Leon Spinks Sports timeline Nelson Frazier, Jr. Hulk Hogan Carlos De Leon Jack Johnson (boxer) HBO Boxing Lennox Lewis Harley Race Dwight Muhammad Qawi Riddick Bowe Sonny Liston November 2004 in sports EastEnders V__ctor Gal__ndez Hasim Rahman Ric Flair United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics Jerry Quarry Michael Spinks Jerry Lawler A.J.

calzaghe kessler whos gonna win this and why i have been away for a few weeks but i see the brit bashing is still rife on the site in my absence the posters who jump on the bandwagon and say that calzaghe has fought nobody pretty much dont know their boxing he has fought or world champions or former world champions during his reign including eubank made or so defences of title woodhall reid both olympic medalists as well as world champs and lacy was supposed to walk through joe and im sick of everyone saying lacy was overrated he was apparently the second coming of tyson according to you american fight fans but as soon as he gets put in his place by a brit you just want to flood the internet with lame excuses i would agree that joe dont like to move outside of britain to fight but that is down to the fact that his purses are much bigger over here because he gets massive gates i think the crowd was at his last fight and who in america gets them crowds exactly nobody as for the fight i see this being a great match up between the two best super middleweights around i see calzaghe controlling the fight as i see him having the better boxing skills i was very impressed with kesslers skills in his fight against andrade but can he do the same against someone with joes talent my one fear in this fight though could be that calzaghe gets drawn into a war which he has been known to do throughout his career its not that joe cant slug because he can but my fear is that if he trys to trade with mikkel then he leaves himself open to injuring his hands again and i dont think that joe can beat kessler with one hand so i believe the way for calzaghe to fight would be too try and hand the younger kessler a boxing lesson as he did to lacy and this should see him victorious in my opinion  Joe Calzaghe Boxing Muhammad Ali Michael Watson Mike Tyson Sugar Ray Robinson Eddie Guerrero Hulk Hogan Evander Holyfield Joe Louis Lennox Lewis The Contender (television series) Steve Collins Naseem Hamed Roy Jones Jr. Sports timeline Professional wrestling match types The Great American Bash International League Chris Benoit Anthony Mundine Norway national football team Calgary Flames Kurt Angle World Boxing Organization Michael Spinks G.I.

prime george foreman vs prime evander holyfield who would win why it really comes down to a matter of styles at that level of boxing and in short evander is tailor made for a young fast incredibly powerful george foreman evander has all the heart and courage of joe frazier with slightly better boxing skills but like frazier evander tends towards a more straightforward attack plan with bobbing and weaving as he comes in to be his initial defensive tactic george foreman in his prime was able to time frazier coming in and unleash tremendous power punches which knocked frazier out both times the first one in two rounds and the second in five i see evander employing much the same fight plan with very little difference in the outcome except that due to slightly greater boxing skill he may survive to around round eight evander has never been one to stick and move very well and would just like joe be drawn into a toe to toe war against an opponent who he would be simply unable to defeat evander would fight and go down like a warrior but he would still go down hard  Evander Holyfield George Foreman Boxing Joe Frazier The Rumble in the Jungle Muhammad Ali Mike Tyson Chris Byrd Heavyweight Michael Moorer Martial art Tenshinhan Mixed martial arts HBO Boxing Riddick Bowe George Chuvalo Ring Magazine's list of 100 greatest punchers of all time Bob Foster Dwight Muhammad Qawi John Ruiz Lennox Lewis Sugar Ray Robinson Roy Jones Jr. Laila Ali Hasim Rahman James Toney Ring Magazine fighters of the year Violence in sports Poker jargon Miyamoto Musashi When We Were Kings Volleyball Jerry Quarry Lightsaber combat Guilty Gear Jersey Joe Walcott New York Knicks Aikido Christy Martin Thrilla in Manila Jack Johnson (boxer) Naseem Hamed Wing Chun Andrea DeShong Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day James "Buster" Douglas Star Wars: Galaxies Joe Louis YuYu Hakusho Bob Fitzsimmons Ossie Ocasio Jack Dempsey Battlebots Humberto Gonzalez Archie Moore Larry Holmes The Contender (television series) Single Transferable Vote Megatron Shen Gong Wu Wilfred Benitez 1990s New York Giants Yom Kippur War James J.

hopkins vs dawson i know it wont happen but lets say all the planets align and it does happen who wins hopkins is my favorite boxer i have a ton of respect for him but i think dawson would beat him with little trouble thats just my opinion what do you guys think dawson will beat anyone in that weight class imo including hopkins hopkins is one of my favorite fighters but dawson will use his speed and youth and outwork outpoint hopkins i dont even think hopkins should be in the ring with calzaghe at this point of his career hopkins has done it all he should be able to retire with pride the thing is that boxing is in his blood and he doesnt show any signs that he really wants to retire boxing is all he knows  Boxing Bernard Hopkins Joe Calzaghe Roy Jones Jr. Willie Pep Sugar Ray Robinson Joe Louis Muhammad Ali Sugar Ray Leonard The Contender (television series) Archie Moore George Foreman F__lix Trinidad Fighting Harada Marco Antonio Barrera Julio C__sar Ch__vez Rocky Marciano Jos__ Napoles Oscar de la Hoya Chris Eubank Jennifer Lopez Lupe Pintor Steve Collins Humphrey Bogart Lionel Rose Atomic Kitten Erik Morales Billy Conn Mike Tyson Juan Martin Coggi Mickey Walker Kid Chocolate Eder Jofre Shane Mosley World Boxing Organization Michael Carbajal Carmen Basilio Alex Ramos Jesse James Leija Gregorio Peralta Andre Dawson Jack Johnson (boxer) Arturo Gatti Humberto Gonzalez Evander Holyfield Mixed martial arts Livingstone Bramble Theresa Arnold Miguel Canto Johns Hopkins University Henry Armstrong Danny Lopez Barry McGuigan Jack Dempsey Carlos Zarate Emile Griffith Family Feud Brenda Burnside Julio C__sar Ch__vez, Jr. Kid Gavilan Yasutsune Uehara Alexis Arg__ello Sonny Liston Frank Bruno Kansas City Chiefs Bobby Chacon Isra Girgrah Santos Laciar Jermain Taylor New England Patriots Boxing training H__ctor Camacho Gerry Cooney PRIDE Muay Thai Jimmy McLarnin Julian Solis Nino Benvenuti Middleweight Michael Moorer Winky Wright Wilfred Benitez Quicksilver Messenger Service Yvonne Trevino Jeff Fenech 24 Hours of Le Mans The Battle of the Little Giants Antonio Tarver Floyd Patterson Nottingham Forest F.C.

who has been the boxers of each decade since the s in my opinion the best fighter in the world during the s and s is no doubt sugar ray robinson the best fighter and the face of boxing during the s and s was muhammed ali best of the s now this is a tough one but i would have to say it was sugar ray leonard but i wouldn't have a problem if someone chose hagler duran or hearns the best during the s i think it would probably be roy jones jr and the best of the s i would go with either hopkins or mayweather jr anyways thats just my opinion what do you guys think you are absolutely right with sugar ray robinson during the s and s he was the greatest pfp fighter ever during the s it was most definitely muhammad ali but i dont know about the s though i mean i know ali beat joe frazier george foreman ken norton and others but he just wasnt as skilled as he was before he was unfairly suspended he was the smartest fighter ill give him that but im leaning towards roberto duran on this one most people talk about him during the s but he lost most of his big fights in the s and after his win over sugar ray leonard he got embarassed in the rematch during the s he was pretty much unstoppable s i say its between leonard hearns hagler tyson and julio cesar chavez im gonna have to go with hagler though since he knocked out hearns beat duran and should have gotten the decision against leonard tyson was absolutely dominant though but hagler fought and beat more challenging fighters chavez was more late s early s i agree with you on roy jones jr in the s he was simply untouchable s ill give mayweather an edge over hopkins and pacquaio since he has made world class fighters look silly he may be boring and annoying but no one can get a clean shot on him  Marvin Hagler George Foreman Roberto Duran Sugar Ray Robinson Ring Magazine's list of 100 greatest punchers of all time Ring Magazine fighters of the year Mike Tyson World Boxing Council Joe Frazier Ring Magazine Evander Holyfield Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Thomas Hearns Roy Jones Jr. Julio C__sar Ch__vez H__ctor Camacho Bernard Hopkins 1980s HBO Boxing Angelo Dundee Juan Martin Coggi Leon Spinks John Mugabi V__ctor Gal__ndez Don King Joe Louis Carlos De Leon Erik Morales The Contender (television series) Laila Ali The Rumble in the Jungle No M__s Fight Caesars Palace Richard Steele (boxing referee) Wilfred Benitez Middleweight Azumah Nelson Jos__ Napoles Floyd Mayweather Jr. Juan Roldan Kostya Tszyu Edwin Rosario Michael Spinks Archie Moore Michael Watson Ken Buchanan Jersey Joe Walcott Antonio Cervantes Alan Minter Wilfredo G__mez Michael Moorer Marco Antonio Barrera Bob Foster Arturo Gatti New York Giants John Ruiz Bob Arum Winky Wright Jesse James Leija Kid Gavilan Sonny Liston Rafael Limon Michael Carbajal Antonio Tarver Jorge Castro (boxer) Carmen Basilio Eder Jofre Pernell Whitaker Genaro Hernandez Johnny Tapia ESPN25 Ken Norton Henry Armstrong Jorge Paez Carlos Zarate Irichelle Duran Jeff Fenech Alex Ramos Oscar de la Hoya Yori Boy Campas Andrzej Go__ota Humphrey Bogart Terry Norris Jack Johnson (boxer) Lennox Lewis George Chuvalo Andrea DeShong Larry Holmes Lightweight Rub__n Olivares Esteban De Jesus Shane Mosley Heavyweight

i just watched rocky for the first time and i noticed that he kept gettting hit constantly in the face and here i am thinking why doesnt he keep his hands up am i alone in thinking this great question well part of the appeal of rocky was that he was a 'club fighter' that went the distance with the world champ of course realistically a club fighter would hopefully keep their hands up but i think that they really wanted rocky to appear 'rough around the edges' and not a polished fighter a guy that goes the distance based soley on his tenacious will to survive there is a great line in another rocky movie either or where apollo says to rocky in training you fight great but i'm a great fighter i'm a big fan of the series with the exception of because rather than just create a 'larger than life hero' they really humanize rocky you can really belive that he is the guy next door that just happens to box down at the local gym it is kind of an ongoing theme throughout the series that rocky grows and develops not only as a boxer but also as a person  Rocky II Boxing Rocky Rocky Marciano The Contender (television series) Mixed martial arts Rocky III Hulk Hogan Sugar Ray Robinson Tenshinhan Solar system Fighting Spirit Muhammad Ali Roy Jones Jr. K' Wilfredo G__mez The Rock (entertainer) Street Fighter II Battlestar Galactica Alexis Arg__ello Andr__s Galarraga Joe Louis Antonio Tarver Mike Tyson The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Boxing training Jeet Kune Do Floyd Patterson Cody Travers Punisher Rocky Mountains Boss (video games) Charley Goldman EastEnders The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show Chuck Wepner Mr. T Wilfred Benitez Final Fight Care Bears Willie Pep Akuma (Street Fighter) Mortal Kombat Kylie Minogue Michael Watson Lou Duva Laura Ingalls Wilder Gundam Daredevil Muay Thai Lennox Lewis Joe Frazier Humphrey Bogart Street Fighter Alpha Leon Spinks Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Notable lines in the Star Wars series King of Fighters Cus D'Amato Fight Club Evander Holyfield Martial art Meat Loaf Jack Johnson (boxer) Computer and video game genres Fighter aircraft Street Fighter (film) U.S. invasion of Afghanistan Vegeta Jack Dempsey YuYu Hakusho George Foreman Bon Jovi Chris Eubank W.

sleep boxing i've been boxing for close to a month now and the other night i woke up to the sound of my window fan slamming against the room i had no idea how it happened but then last night i had the same thing happen and i was still throwing punches this is no joke i'm kind of worried about it it could be a problem if the ladies are over any idea why this happens or a way to stop it lol wow this seriously sounds like you are really into your boxing nothing more than your mind seriously staying in focus mode they say most thoughts that you dream up or conjure up yourself in your sleep are of some strong interest to what you really want in life basically you must really want to succeed in boxing and probably have been training pretty good i know what the feeling is because i have been through it thinking about a coming up fight or about perfecting a new maneuver i had just learned to greater my boxing skill you think about it so much that when you sleep you'll in fact dream it into a reality in your mind your body starts to move as if you are interacting with it when awake if this is a problem to you bro just try not to think about boxing so much but i honestly think it is a good think it shows how much you are dedicated and focused how much your body and mind really want it you should let the ladies know before they go to bed with you lol if you in fact end up hitting one of the girls you are with in bed just tell them you thought she was being harmed and because of natural instinct you started to box to protect ha ha then she will feel all good inside knowing her man is there to protect her when in fact you didn't know what the hell was going on lol focus your mind with other things in life slow down take a breath and relax  Out-of-body experience Shaggy dog story Milton H.

what was rocky marciano's training regimen i've had trouble digging up how he trained other than he ran a lot beat up a pound heavy bag and did underwater punching has anyone bought a book detailing it that would like to post the routine here or have any of you found a site with a laid out plan that he did there are a few good biographies on him that go into his training but not an exact account he forsaked spicy foods and pepper because they could weaken the intestines never smoked or even drank wine during his boxing career he made a lot of sacrifices in these areas considering he was italian he stayed in shape all the time and sparred about twice as much and held camps twice as long as all other boxers for the last two or three weeks before a fight he spoke to no one just trained and concentrated the dude was freaky  Rocky Marciano Boxing training Boxing The Contender (television series) Archie Moore Charley Goldman Muay Thai Jersey Joe Walcott Sugar Ray Robinson Mike Tyson Rocky Roy Jones Jr. Norway national football team Sonny Liston Frogman Red Hot Chili Peppers Floyd Patterson Sailing Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Philmont Scout Ranch Bong Black pepper Martial art One Piece minor characters George Foreman U.S. invasion of Afghanistan Larry Holmes Humphrey Bogart Shen Gong Wu Ty Cobb Lou Duva Anchor Joe Louis German cuisine Korean cuisine Sacrifice Michael Carbajal Eucharist Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle The Rumble in the Jungle Muhammad Ali Fighting Spirit Tenshinhan Opportunity rover Barbecue Ramen Leon Spinks Sergey Korolyov Ezzard Charles Handloading Marathon (sport) Social rule Channel Tunnel New York City Subway Rocky II Meat Loaf Battle of Crete Urinary incontinence Coeliac disease USS Hoel (DD-533) EastEnders Elis Prefecture Marco Antonio Barrera Ben Johnson (athlete) Women's boxing Rigging Weight training Michael Spinks 7 July 2005 London bombings USS Wasp (CV-18) Glossary of nautical terms Lionel Rose Dariusz Michalczewski Cuisine of the Southern United States Bernard Hopkins Food preservation Comanche Cuisine of Denmark Mickey Walker Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Timeline of underwater technology Babe Ruth Donovan Wilfredo G__mez Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) James J.

what's with all the perceived boxing racism a k a marciano i'm honestly surprised about how many people are labeling others racist for their opinions on who's the best fighter has there been a boom of name calling in boxing lately or has this always happened i think people take their frustrations out on this forum instead of really looking at the boxers and relating to boxing questions i say recognize talent where talent exists marciano was a good champ ali was a good champ frazier was a good champ dempsey was a good champ etc etc etc its sad to define someone by their color instead of by what they have accomplished or by how they have accomplished it  Boxing Heavyweight Rocky Marciano Muhammad Ali Joe Frazier Archie Moore Jersey Joe Walcott Charley Goldman Fighting Spirit George Foreman Joe Louis Sugar Ray Robinson Rocky Floyd Patterson Max Baer Larry Holmes Jack Dempsey Theory of conduct Max Schmeling Mike Tyson Lennox Lewis Internet troll The Rumble in the Jungle Laila Ali Jack Johnson (boxer) Leon Spinks Thrilla in Manila Champ Car Ring Magazine's list of 100 greatest punchers of all time Agnosticism Black (people) Alexis Arg__ello Ring Magazine fighters of the year Women's boxing Henry Armstrong Jerry Quarry Ezzard Charles Wilfred Benitez The Contender (television series) White nationalism Ring Magazine Sugar Ray Leonard Fight of the Century Don King Irish people Evander Holyfield World Boxing Council Lou Duva Scientific racism Nationalism Michael Spinks South Carolina Race and intelligence (Public controversy) Bob Foster Racism HBO Boxing Te__filo Stevenson Bob Fitzsimmons Azumah Nelson Atheism Arab-Israeli conflict Marvin Hagler Validity of human races The Cure Tony Tubbs White trash Sexual orientation Skinhead Generation X Self-hatred Harry Greb Culture George Chuvalo Anti-Defamation League Anti-Zionism World Boxing Association Political status of Taiwan Willie Pep Nazism Boxing at the 2004 Summer Olympics Joe Calzaghe Aesthetic Realism Polyamory Boxing training F__lix Trinidad Rub__n Olivares The Big Tall Wish Eugenics Jess Willard Middleweight Our Gang Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Wilfredo G__mez The nature of God in Western theology Homophobia Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Bret Hart Generation Y Angelo Dundee Grunge music

where are all the tough boxers evander holyfield seems to be the last real tough guy before that frazier back in the old days all those guys were tough why don't we have them anymore except for some of those smaller mexican guys blogbaba is david tua that big japanese guy is he on steroids writersblock should be named mental block he said marquez was ko'd twice and came back and won i may be a girl but i'm not that stupid actually that was the baseball guy but writersblock is dumb too i think the toughest boxer currently active today is david tua and odds are tua has more than enough left to take holyfield or any of the weaker glass jawed european heavyweights out there unfortunately it appears a slavic trait to duck tua clearly fear of tua's punching power makes it almost impossible for david to get a shot at any of the worthless titles currently held by these paper chumpions guys like mikkel kessler and winky wright are about as tough as any in the history of boxing and they certainly are not smaller mexican guys there are plenty of tough fighters today they just lack the skill levels of the past guys like joe calzaghe and floyd mayweather are tough as nails and don't sport mexican heritage hell floyd don't even know how to put a sombrero on properly he wore it backwards for the dela hoya fight still i have to admit when it comes to toughness there is nothing like a latino fighter and guys like duran chavez and even cotto define the word toughness a lot of current heavyweight pretenders now days are products of european chemical laboratory expertise it is almost as if they lose toughness because of the artificial chemicals used to bulk them up i heard the steroids some major league ball players used were eastern european in origin they were made in a former soviet bloc states for use by olympic athletes but sold on the black market after the former soviet union went bankrupt the artificial size increases brought about by those lab experiments makes them bigger and stronger but they lose that toughness western hemisphere anthletes have and when they get in a tough fight they quit on their stools like tyson or klitschko did instead of toughing it out like the fighters of yesteryear i think it is a slavic problem and somehow it rubbed off on tyson so they just quit instead of finishing a tough fights real champions don't quit but todays heavyweights do go figure they just seem weaker somehow than the heavyweights of old  Mike Tyson Evander Holyfield Muhammad Ali John Ruiz Chris Byrd Hasim Rahman Lennox Lewis Heavyweight George Foreman Sports timeline Mixed martial arts Vitali Klitschko November 2004 in sports Hulk Hogan Michael Moorer Floyd Mayweather Jr. Sugar Ray Leonard HBO Boxing Joe Frazier Lou Duva Shane Mosley Rocky Marciano Kurt Angle St. Louis Cardinals Doom enemies History of baseball in the United States 1980s Professional wrestling match types Professional wrestling slang Bernard Hopkins Winky Wright Kostya Tszyu The Contender (television series) Ring Magazine Shawn Michaels Joe Calzaghe Larry Holmes New York Giants Norway national football team Softball December 2004 in sports Fernando Vargas Babe Ruth Sports in Puerto Rico World Wrestling Entertainment Dwight Muhammad Qawi Summer Olympic Games Roy Jones Jr. Pernell Whitaker Floyd Patterson World Series James "Buster" Douglas Don King Eddie Guerrero Archie Moore May 2005 in sports A.J.

mayweather what do you really think about mayweather jr a lot of people say his fight are fixed i just think he is a great boxer what are your opinons well i wouldn't say that the fights are fixed i'll just say that his opponent selection has been carefully picked especially when it comes to the timing in which he faces his opponents fighting some marquee names when they are no longer in their prime though some people don't like mayweather's style of fighting personally it doesn't bother me one bit i feel that their is a solution for every style that is faced the thing that keeps my attention in a mayweather fight is seeing whether or not the opponent is going to figure out the solution to beating mayweather would i like to see more action out of mayweather yes but i can't knock him for style of hit and run because no one likes to get hit as mentioned wondering whether someone can put together a fight plan to upset mayweather is what keeps my attention in his fights  Floyd Mayweather Jr. Azati Prime (ENT episode) Star Trek: Enterprise Theory of conduct The Contender (television series) Mixed martial arts Social rule Muhammad Ali Erik Morales Arturo Gatti Boxing Daredevil Piccolo Junior Saga U.S. presidential election, 2008 Norway national football team Jonathan Archer Friends Rafael Limon Sin City Rocky Marciano Jesse James Leija Mike Tyson Evander Holyfield Poker jargon Julio C__sar Ch__vez Grandview, U.S.A.

correct me if i'm wrong or just feel free to disagree floyd mayweather is a tailor made champion i personally think that floyd mayweather is probably pound for pound the most naturally gifted and skilled boxer in the world but i think he is a tailor made champion it seems to me that he will not fight anyone that he cannot dominate with speed the only opponet that he has gotten in the ring with that had his level of ability was zab judah if you follow judah you know that he has a preparation problem if he does not knock you out in the the first rounds he will gas out and lose and if you saw the fight you can argue that zab won of those six rounds he has not gotten in there with anyone who is a legitemate threat since no disprespect to de la hoya i love him but de la hoya of is not the de la hoya of when he was much quicker reckless and willing to force the issue now everyone was excited about a matchup with shane mosley shane will not be dominated by speed and poses a legitmate threat so i say the fight will never happen what do you think mayweather is definitely tailor made he has handpicked his opponents for the last few years gatti baldomir an aging oscar come on where is mosley where is margarito and now all the sudden floyd thinks he is gods gift to boxing and will only fight for money something he obviously can't get with margarito but he sure as sh t could with mosley so why won't he fight mosley the answer is an obvious one mayweather knows he will lose i love how mayweather fans always skirt that subject why won't floyd fight mosley  Shane Mosley Floyd Mayweather Jr. Oscar de la Hoya Winky Wright Zab Judah Kostya Tszyu Antonio Margarito Genaro Hernandez John John Molina Bernard Hopkins Welterweight Javier Castillejo The Contender (television series) F__lix Trinidad Erik Morales Ivan Calder__n (boxer) Sugar Ray Robinson Floyd Patterson David Reid (boxer) H__ctor Camacho Mike Tyson Evander Holyfield Edwin Rosario Muhammad Ali Ricardo Mayorga Glen Jacobs Richie Sandoval Naseem Hamed Bob Arum Roy Jones Jr. Joe Louis Bobby Chacon 2005 United States Grand Prix Sonny Liston Jack Dempsey Kermit Cintron Jorge Paez Archie Moore Professional wrestling match types Paul Wight September 2004 in sports Yori Boy Campas Fernando Vargas Sugar Ray Leonard Dick Tiger Rafael Limon Livingstone Bramble Gameplay of StarCraft George Foreman Primo Carnera Kurt Angle Joey Maxim Rocky Marciano Carlos Zarate Carlos Palomino The Rumble in the Jungle Joe Frazier Azumah Nelson December 2004 in sports Willie Pep Samuel Serrano Emanuel Steward Yvon Durelle Playoff Mark Calaway Mixed martial arts Lightweight Bob Fitzsimmons Henry Armstrong John Mugabi Free will Piccolo Junior Saga Leon Spinks Jerry Quarry November 2004 in sports Marco Antonio Barrera Theory of conduct A.J.

a prime marciano versus a prime holyfield marciano undefeated with a lions heart iron jaw a young george forman punch both hands holyfield best built boxer in history bar none strong jaw fast counter puncher great endurence can tie up even an octopus marciano no known weakness short of arm reach holyfield best of class when his heart is into it marciano fits nicely into the dempsey class but more powerful in punch than jack holyfield supurb boxer that many feel was infinitly better than the young cassius clay if thats possible who would win what round first let me correct you with a few mistakes that you happen to jot down as your fictional opinions on marciano sense i am a boxing historian as well as ex boxer marciano had one hand his right nothing more and nothing less not both hands pal also his power was not even remotely close to a young george foreman let alone compared to dempsey sorry but no way in hell did marciano move like dempsey let alone punch like him two different styles partner although marciano was more powerful than dempsey he sure in the hell did not move like him if you try to argue with me about these stating you are only making yourself look foolish trying to outwit me in my own game won't possibly work for you now back to the question at hand holyfield at true weight would be cruiser weight and marciano would fit right into the category if he gained the few pounds necessary to compete he wouldn't be ranked as a heavyweight let alone a light heavy is middleweight as much as marciano likes to rely on his powerful right i am afraid that he would have to utilize a little more skill with it to actually hurt holyfield holyfield moves efficiently and he does tie you up effectively also with the headbutting i wouldn't be surprised if marciano starts to cut and bleed in saying that if marciano doesn't knock holyfield out within the early rounds don't expect him to do it later holyfield only gets better later into the fights and he starts to headbutt more expect marciano to show definite signs of cuts and bleeding amongst his face i see marciano landing one right and then literally eating a flurry of counter punches thrown by holyfield as you know marciano has a tendency to drop his left hand very low and with a skilled fighter like holyfield he would see the opening and take advantage besides that marciano has no real leverage as he needs his left dropped completely down to throw a massive bomb with is right basically like i said if marciano doesn't land that one bomb don't expect him to take holyfield out later i think holyfield if the fight ended up lasting for long round would end up cutting marciano bad which would result in a stoppage of the fight i don't think holyfield can knockout marciano but i do believe he can cut him bad because marciano did cut very easily either marciano by ko or holyfield by stoppage this is my final answer and i can't say what round because it can go either way and there is no telling how long it will take the much slower lack of general defense marciano to land his right p s not only do i believe you will be unsatisfied with my answer only because you are a delusional marciano fan who doesn't know the science behind boxing but it's alright because many will see and read and understand that fact is marciano had limited skill compared to the fighters of later years specifically the 's and up believe what you want buddy but the fact remains that i haven't spent most of my life in the boxing world for nothing and not even a few thumbs down will stop the fact that my answer in general will be better than all who can answer this question with fine detail fact is i am not a top contributor to these boxing questions for nothing and i am getting tired of these absurd marciano questions coming from fans who first judge him by the color of his skin and not the fact that he was just an average boxer with great power and chin plus heart everything else has to definitely fall into the average category whatever though just read and take into consideration that i mean what i say and what i say is fact not fiction thank you  Jack Dempsey George Foreman

boxer training what do boxers do to increase thier stamina to be able to fight for longer periods of time oh and i will choose best answer i am a boxer out of ny city and have found it takes a lot of time and tons of hard boring work lots of running and lots of rounds in the gym is really the basics your body basically needs to be able to recover after putting in hard work ali once said no one can fight full speed every round so you train your body to go hard for a few rounds and then let it rest a little more other rounds swimming is very good too another reason a lot of new fighters get tired quickly is because they do not control their heart rate and breathing if you dont control yourself and stay calm you breath harder therefore burning more energy sometimes believe it or not newer fighters forget to breath  Boxing Swimming The Contender (television series) Muhammad Ali Unreal Weight training The Rumble in the Jungle Internal ballistics Sugar Ray Robinson Vegeta Roy Jones Jr. Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Fighting Spirit Drowning Mike Tyson Breaststroke Piccolo Junior Saga M16 (rifle) Boxing training Fast bowling Frogman Equine conformation Michael Watson Suicide methods Mobile Fighter G Gundam Chinese martial arts Tai Chi Chuan Tag Dog agility Jack Johnson (boxer) Joe Frazier Alexander Technique Heinkel He 112 Diving Front crawl Kitesurfing Beau Jack Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Carbon dioxide Tenshinhan Backstroke Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Jack Dempsey Hard disk Floyd Patterson Fire fighting Butterfly stroke Qigong Zero (Mega Man) Little Britain Martial art Monster Rancher monsters Social rule Guilty Gear Rebreather Apollo 8 Steel Marathon (sport) Joe Louis Brewery Leon Spinks Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Car handling Emergency Medical Services Exercise Heart rate Bubble Bobble Archie Moore 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sonic the Hedgehog The Sims 2: University George Foreman Redundant array of independent disks Urinary incontinence Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Rocky IV Muay Thai EastEnders Aikido Firefighter Naseem Hamed Shen Gong Wu Pump It Up Dragons (Pern) RuneScape weapons Charizard Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Sonny Liston Diablo II V__ctor Gal__ndez Michael Moorer Gameplay of StarCraft Juan Martin Coggi Jet engine Professional wrestling throws Action potential Terminal ballistics MAME

how much do journeymen boxers get paid for fighting it depends some boxers can start at as little as a fight in britain probably about in the us then you have countries like thailand mexico philippines and south africa where due to the economies journeymen will get paid even less in fact make that much less that will be mostly for journeymen fighting up and comers to pad the stats of a prospect if fighter has a solid record but without any wins over name fighters then the fighter may make a couple thousand pounds sterling or dollars to be a stand in for a no show or a tune up for a major fighter only if when a guy becomes a top contender or a world champion does he break in to the big time do the millions come because they are getting paid for how many people wanna see a guy box if a boxer's name sells tickets then they can demand and get more per fight just to deviate from the topic a little amateur experience can also determine pro earnings potential to n extent marvin hagler was not touted as an amateur and in his first fight as a pro in he fought in a high school hall in brockton and ot paid for it by contrast sugar ray leonard won an olympic gold medal in and on his pro debut in was pid  Boxing Sugar Ray Leonard Roy Jones Jr. Bernard Hopkins Marvin Hagler Sugar Ray Robinson Muhammad Ali Mike Tyson World Boxing Council Evander Holyfield Leon Spinks Jack Dempsey Caesars Palace The Contender (television series) Roberto Duran Kurt Angle Meldrick Taylor Ring Magazine Emanuel Steward Archie Moore George Foreman Michael Watson Sport in the United Kingdom Alan Minter Summer Olympic Games Rocky Marciano James J.

need a boxing routine i need some help with figuring out a boxing routine but the catch is that i dont have a heavy bag but i do have wraps jump rope and a place to do all this i plan on doing this for self defense and fitness all i ask is a routine thanx no heavy bag no prblem go to the army navy store get a duffle bag line in with heavy duty trash bags and fillit with play ground sand from home depot or you can try to find one on e bay a pawn shop or i got mine at a yard sell lb everlast perfect condition for bucks and here is a great routine work on combinations while one punch can be effective when they are delivered in vollies of two three four five or six they become devastating that is the theory behind combinations combinations take skill and stamina you expend a lot of energy punching away and only through conditioning will you be able to last a whole fight whether it is four rounds or twelve combinations require that you complete each punch correctly so that it sets you up for the next one for instance a jab will set you up for any number of punches a straight right puts your weight in the right position for a left hook combinations flow they are never awkward to perform as long as all the punches are performed in sequence and with technical precision that is your mission should you choose to accept it so what are the combinations well there are many but you will want to master the following again see fighting fit by doug werner and alan lachica for illustrations of these combination as well as over other photos or remember on the punches page each punch had a number beside it well here is where they come in handy to recap again reverse for southpaws jab straight right left hook left uppercut right uppercut so a is two jabs a is three jabs these combinations are an effective way to throw a bunch of punches from a distance it is imperative you recover completely after each jab so subsequent jabs are delivered effectively and accurately one of the most important and famous of all combinations the mighty in this you throw a jab which closes the distance and sets up the head for the power punch of the straight right delivered right after the objective with the jab is to snap your opponent's head back which exposes his chin which you then nail with the right sending him to the mat throughout the whole sequence you should feel firm on your feet never off balance if you do you're not doing something right it's one of two things you are either reaching for the opponent or not recovering completely from your punches both big no no's the other most important combination good english eh jab straight right left hook this basically completes the same objective for the first two punches jab the head to expose the chin nail the chin with the straight right this creates a weight transfer to the left side which automatically sets you up to land a devastating left hook your target for the left hook is the right temple of your opponent clobber it perfecting these two combinations will take some time but make sure you do they are all natural and like all combinations must flow you'll have a pretty good indication when you are doing them right because it will feel right not to mention the power of your punches will increase and the right left right and the opposite left right left the goal here is to time the weight shifts correctly with every punch you throw it should set you up nicely for the subsequent punch the right shifts the weight over the left which is perfect for the left hook which subsequently puts the weight back over the right which naturally makes you want to throw the right again the challenge here is to ensure you are not just throwing a flurry of arm punches you must get your body involved because that is where the power comes from then you will see true devastation as your opponent receives your offense from two different angles that's part of the beauty of combinations delivered correctly punches start hitting you from all different angles it makes defense that much harder the use of combinations while extremely effective also requires extreme caution it is easy to forget to recover after each punch when you send out the flock of arms but every time you don't recover you expose half your head and if your opponent realizes it kiss a few brain cells bye bye adding uppercuts into the mix word of advice get the four combinations mentioned above perfected first then worry about putting in the uppercuts uppercuts are used in close and you do need to work them into your combinations but adding them is very hard to do correctly and takes a great deal of time and precision and dedication to master when you are ready here is a six punch combination for you good luck with that heavy bag workout once you get one together the second workout is more strenuous as it takes rounds it's also more fun as you work some combinations there's nothing like unleashing or punches in a row that flow together nicely heavy bag workout harder workout with this workout go for speed power and coordination each punch must be fully recovered in order to set you up correctly

evander holyfield vs mike tyson we all know that of tysons success was becuse of fear and intimidation holyfield was never afraid of mike and always felt he would kick his butt burt sugar and the boys on espn classic tell this story in at the olympic trials holyfield whitaker taylor hill tillman basically all of our great fighters were in the rec room shooting pool tyson burst through the door grabbed the cue stick off the table and said i'm next everyone in the room jumped back stunned and afraid to do anything except evander he walked right up into tysons face with the look of someone ready to fight and said you'll wait your turn tyson looked at holyfield for a second and then handed the stick to holyfield wheeled and left the room tyson was a heavyweight weighing about at the time and evander was a lt heavy weighing about tyson didn't want any part of holyfield even then i say there has never been a day that tyson could take holyfield your thoughts devon i think they talk about it during the hour retrospective of holyfield's career why do people keep insisting that tyson was washed up at age that is so stupid he was washed up when he started fighting good fighters if he was so good he would be good with me training him my question is what are your thoughts on the boxing fraud that was mike tyson it cracks me up when people talk about modern training methods in boxing the old metods were better and the fighters stayed in much better shape there was much more discipline then they didn't walk around eating doughnuts like winky wright the ali cooper story is true i saw it it has just been exzagerated to minutes when if fact it was a minute or so just long enough for ali to recover from sure defeat the spinx fight was a joke too he gets hit on the arm and then looks for a good soft place to lay down that fight was over when they signed the contract gerry s must not know about tyson buying his way out of a few other rape charges black panther i'm still laughing at the fact that you said tyson peaked at age he sure had a short peak considering he couldn't even make the olympic team a couple of years earlier i completely agree it's the old adage you stand up to a bully and you own him holyfield has never feared any fighter when he took tyson's biggest punch in the nd round of the first tyson knew he could not defeat the real deal  Boxing George Foreman Riddick Bowe Shaggy dog story Muhammad Ali Hasim Rahman James "Buster" Douglas Piccolo Junior Saga Heavyweight Larry Holmes November 2004 in sports Mixed martial arts Michael Moorer Lou Duva Professional wrestling match types ESPN25 EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Contender (television series) Akuma (Street Fighter) Shawn Michaels Professional wrestling attacks HBO Boxing Martial art Eddie Guerrero Violence in sports Sin City Roy Jones Jr. Humphrey Bogart Wyatt Earp Extreme Championship Wrestling The Inside John Ruiz July 2004 in sports Pittsburgh Steelers Sugar Ray Robinson Katelyn Faber Carolina Panthers Montreal Screwjob Major League Baseball television contracts Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Snooker Vegeta K' Norway national football team Tenshinhan Matt Hardy Tank Guilty Gear Milton H.

all i want to know from the american boxing fans is how much do you want to see mayweather hatton regardless of the result or your predictions is this what you want to see because its the only thing ricky wants knowing that the public wants to see it he just wants a fight that gets the world exited it would be a great fight americans like all fights we are frustrated that they take so long to come together the sport is hurt because no one can watch fights unless you pay per view and how can someone get interested if they never get to see it mayweather is at the end of his career and they are always fearful of ending on a loss look at the end of roy jones career  Roy Jones Jr. Floyd Mayweather Jr. Kostya Tszyu Muhammad Ali Erik Morales Arturo Gatti Chris Eubank Jesse James Leija EastEnders Antonio Tarver 1957 World Series Michael Watson Star Trek: Enterprise Bernard Hopkins Tenshinhan Julio C__sar Ch__vez John Ruiz The Great American Bash Demarcus Corley Oakland Athletics Genaro Hernandez War Carolina Panthers Starfleet ranks and insignia Boxing Willie Nelson Philadelphia Eagles Bret Hart H__ctor Camacho Keynesian economics Pernell Whitaker Inflation Samuel Serrano StarrCade Livingstone Bramble Sugar Ray Robinson Marco Antonio Barrera The Contender (television series) 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Aliens of London Archie Moore Ric Flair Mike Weaver Winky Wright Strange New World (Enterprise episode) Dariusz Michalczewski Manchester City F.C.

who should wladimir klitschko fight next who wins wladimir klitschko vs james toney i think this fight will happen next here's why wladimir is looking for top ranked opponent or title holders to fight everyone else is busy with fights peter maskaev byrd brock chambers povetkin valuev and etc all have fights and probably won't be fighting again until early in yet james toney is suspended but got his sentenced reduced so he will be in the ring about sometime in nov klitschko already stated he wanted to fight again this year so i think this will happen who wins could this be the first time toney ever gets ktfo or can toney bounce back tremendously from the two samuel peter lost i think its time for toney to go to sleep because toney use to have one of the best defenses now he is getting a lot easier to hit i really don't care about the heavyweight division except for the klitschkos klitschko wins easily in a matchup with james toney this is a no brainer as for wlad's next opponent anyone who has the nuts i'd like to see him take on oleg maskaev but there's really nobody in the division that can hold a candle to him he's got his fierceness and confidence back look out  Vitali Klitschko Wladimir Klitschko Chris Byrd John Ruiz Roy Jones Jr. Lamon Brewster Evander Holyfield Boxing April 2005 in sports James Toney Heavyweight World Boxing Organization Lennox Lewis Sugar Ray Leonard Hasim Rahman Chris Eubank Kurt Angle James 'Bonecrusher' Smith Corrie Sanders Professional wrestling match types Shawn Michaels Sugar Ray Robinson The Contender (television series) Iron Bowl Leon White Paul Levesque Cleveland Browns Antonio Tarver Bob Fitzsimmons Playoff Muhammad Ali Rocky Marciano A.J.

rate of the heavy weight division do you think boxing would be better with a federal commision over seeing the sanctioning bodies or do you think it needs just one major sanctioning body instead of big ones and one med size one it is not the sanctioning bodies fault that the heavyweight division would lose a tournament to the middle weight division it's simply a historically low point talent wise for the big fella's the alphabet soup organizations have destroyed the meaning of the word champion and cheapened the championship titles to the point that the belts are meaningless all of them should combine under the auspices of world organization much like fide does with chess it would restore a certain amount of respectibility to professional boxing unfortunately where is involved all bets are off the problem is much bigger than american regulation of american boxing and a federal commission in the united states would have no real effect on professional boxing's biggest problems no one in history has figured out how to address world wide corruption yet and odds are it won't happen anytime soon we must deal with boxing as it is and hope for the best  Boxing ELO rating system F__d__ration Internationale des __checs National Wrestling Alliance World Boxing Council World Chess Championship World Boxing Association Roy Jones Jr. Garry Kasparov Chess World Wrestling Entertainment Gambling World Championship Wrestling Bob Fitzsimmons Hulk Hogan Professional wrestling match types Bobby Fischer Evander Holyfield NWA World Heavyweight Championship A.J.

i'm challenging the legitimacy of the linear tag to be the man you have to beat the man not necessarily when recognized champion james jeffries retired after defeating jack monroe in he took the title into retirement with him a new title was manufactured and given to the winner of the marvin hart jack root hart won in joe louis relinquished the heavyweight title and again interrupted the linear chain and another title had to be created in the great rocky marciano retired and a new championship was manufactured etc webster's dictionary definition of linear lineal an unbroken line of events or relativity relationship from beginning to end in order to be the man you have to beat the man so according to definition the so called linear heavyweight title doesn't really exist of course there are arguments for it but they cannot hold any weight due to the definition i don't believe in the linear title but i do believe in recognized champions and i think the fans and the media get to make that judgement not the alphabet boys please educated and intelligent responses only stupid foolish responses will be not be taken seriously actually they will be laughed and the author will be called a random female's name fill lewis' shoes excuse me lennox lewis was a joke not a champion he ducked more than a ball collector at a driving range lewis retired out of fear not age or legacy i agree with bryghtendeavors the linear title is fraudulent  Boxing Rocky Marciano Lennox Lewis Professional wrestling match types Hulk Hogan Shawn Michaels Greg Valentine Archie Moore Joe Louis In Your House Leon White Bret Hart Survivor Series James J.

why has wlad klitschko consistantly ducked the better heavy weight contenders in favor of fighting guys like laman brewster a non champion was out of boxing for a year ray austin please this guy was an absolute nobody calvin brock a suspect contender and non champion why hasn't klitschko fought any of the heavy weight champions yet if klitschko is this devastating champion why is he so afraid of a real test why didn't he give sam peter a rematch is it because peter as a young fighter almost knocked him out in their first fight why hasn't klitschko fought briggs rahman who is a bum he could have even fought james toney a year ago back when toney fought rahman twice toney is a hall of fame fighter although a small heavy is this why klitschko was scared to fight him because of toney's hall of fame boxing skills there are three other heavy weight champs and klitschko still hasn't fought any of them that is ridiculous wlad klitschko is a fraud and his last three fights prove it the current string of eastern european fighters such as vitali klitschko nicolai valuev wladimir klitschko oleg maskaev and ruslan chagaev are being protected against any possible heavyweight fighter that appears to be a threat to their title reign another factor that has to be taken under consideration is that promoters bob arum and don king with the help of the wba wbc and ibf are manipulating the ratings another factor we have to look at is there are no serious heavyweight prospects on the horizon my friend  Vitali Klitschko Chris Byrd Hasim Rahman Roy Jones Jr. Evander Holyfield Boxing World Boxing Organization George Foreman World Boxing Council Heavyweight Antonio Tarver Bernard Hopkins Corrie Sanders Muhammad Ali Sugar Ray Leonard Eddie Guerrero Archie Moore Joe Louis James 'Bonecrusher' Smith Michael Spinks K-1 Dwight Muhammad Qawi Wilfredo G__mez Wilfred Benitez December 2004 in sports Sugar Ray Robinson Andrzej Go__ota Hulk Hogan Aaron Pryor Azumah Nelson Roberto Duran Mike Weaver Julio C__sar Ch__vez Michael Moorer Larry Holmes Manuel Pacquiao Erik Morales Leon Spinks Kostya Tszyu James J.

mayorga vs vargas i know this fight will not be bought by a lot of people but i think it will be showed on showtime for free also but my question is that do you think that with both fighters hating each other with a passion will it be a slugfest or a yawner i personally think that all the drama that has happened is not pre fight build up i think this is real antamosity like frazier hating ali before the first fight in vargas hates mayorga and vice versa any thoughts this is going to be a tremendous fight the styles of these two men suggest that it can't be anything else even when vargas uses his boxing skills he still isn't a runner or someone who's fleet footed enough to stay on the outside and jab he likes to use his jab slip and counter and move you into position when he's boxing but vargas is to proud to box a fighter like mayorga he wants to put hurt on him and mayorga hate him or love him always comes to fight this will be a hagler hearns type fight as long as it lasts look for both men to land some early bombs in a wild slugfest before vargas stops mayorga in i think the hatred between these two is about as legit as they come and that's why it will be a great fight a lot of pride is on the line for both fighters  F__lix Trinidad Ricardo Mayorga Sugar Ray Leonard Joe Frazier Muhammad Ali Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Thomas Hearns YuYu Hakusho Joe Louis Carnival of Champions Caesars Palace John Mugabi Professional wrestling holds Winky Wright Michael Watson The Rumble in the Jungle Kylie Minogue Mike Tyson Mixed martial arts George Foreman F-16 Fighting Falcon EastEnders Ranma __ characters Hate speech Fight Club Jack Johnson (boxer) Mobile Fighter G Gundam Alcoholics Anonymous Kimi Finster Knots Landing Professional wrestling slang Martial art Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tenshinhan Antonio Inoki Nigel Benn Home Box Office HBO Boxing Battle of Britain The Contender (television series) Laila Ali Wilfred Benitez October 2004 in sports Chris Eubank Days of our Lives Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Fatal Fury Nation of Islam Nine Inch Nails Thrilla in Manila Have I Got News For You Fictional crossover Whose Line Is It Anyway?

who do you think will win between jermaine taylor vs kelly pavlick on september i have to agree with stonewall if taylor doesn't follow the instructions of stewart then it could be a long night for the current champ in the past stewart has given taylor good instructions especially in the wright fight but taylor didn't follow any of it making the fight more difficult than it should have been i can still see taylor winning but only if he listens to stewart or his striking with his overhand right has gotten more accurate that's not really saying that i think taylor will win but it wouldn't surprise me if he comes out still the champion one thing is for sure taylor should not take this fight lightly or he'll be looking at the lights from the canvas  Clash of Champions Jermain Taylor StarrCade Bernard Hopkins Aston Villa F.C.

prime joe frazier vs prime mike tyson who would win why lets look at the facts both in their primes both came to fight and both proved to go the distance and still maintain smoking joe up and down constant head movement with arms crossed defense he utilized a quick right hook that he would throw ever so often in between his up and down bobbing joe liked to smash on the body with body shots but they didn't have the spark needed to put a man down with just one he always needed multiple he also didn't have a snapping jab but what he lacked in general skill he made up for in heart and the will to proceed even if it looked over for him iron mike fast illusive side to side head movement all in all mike in his prime had the whole package he was definitely up their with the most powerful punchers of all time and because of his speed and accuracy also not to mention combinations never seen even in the 's fighters that would break a grown man into a child mike may have not had the heart of joe but what he did have in general skill joe was just a philly brawler who didn't take no for an answer just like any philly boxer who comes onto the scene notice how rapid joe bobs his head up and down now with an upper cut specialist like mike what do you think would happen rooney would notice it and tell mike to utilize joe's mistake with an upper cut damn i would have loved to seen a super fight between them both i don't see joe winning this fight but i also don't see mike taking joe out that easily it will either be a decision on the behalf of mike or he knocks joe out late i would want to know how joe would take a quick jab body shot upper cut from mike's book of unique combinations i know for a fact that joe has never in his whole career been hit with one of those naturally for two small heavyweights mike was the more complete boxer but like i mentioned before he lacked the heart and determination to have a steady long career like joe besides that with the way joe displays his hands when in defense he will for sure be eating a brutal body shot that will leave him peeing blood in the end mike had devastating power and his body shots even sounded like a bat being put to the body of a human joe had a flurry of body shots but where half the power of what mike delivered in his you have to think about this big e mike was a complete fighter but he lacked the will to survive because he had accomplished everything he wanted and was destined to become after the spinks knockout was when mike was totally done mentally and you can tell he wanted to retire according to rooney he wanted mike to have about more fights over seas and then come back to have a super fight against holyfield which he would then retire with an undefeated record and better than marciano's believe me that was the plan and he would have destroyed holyfield had he stayed with the program rooney knew what he was doing and he knew mike would beat holyfield mike's head wasn't in the game anymore after that if you are talking about a prime time before douglas still with rooney mike tyson then there is no way smoking joe could have beaten mike had mike fought with the 's fighters in his prime he would have done allot better than most give him credit for if you think about it how could you doubt a boxer like mike who displayed skill never seen before in that division how even ali gave the man respect because even ali had never seen such skill out of a small fighter until mike came along you think ali was worried about a frazier lol i don't think so frazier was bad ass don't get me wrong but he would have been beaten by mike hands down in their primes mike is the more complete fighter who had a solid chin and was more powerful than frazier and he had better combinations he was more accurate and he knew how to fight and bring the fight imagine two fighters like joe and mike who both like to come forward they would square off in the middle of the ring and start slugging and lol i just don't see joe winning that brawl basically what tools does frazier have that mike doesn't already have but better what can frazier beat mike with if frazier could withstand a brutal beating reminisce of the foreman frazier fight he could stand a chance but i just don't see it happening like that mike by late ko or decision don't think for one second that i hate smoking joe because he is one of my favs of all time still no matter mike is the more complete fighter  Joe Louis The Rumble in the Jungle Michael Moorer Pittsburgh Steelers Tenshinhan Roy Jones Jr.

who was the best heavyweight under ' talking about the all around package the skill power and means to win who was the best and who had the best style for a fighter under feet i can't handle the truth joe louis was ' well over feet sorry but your answer does not count although louis was bad ass he was over feet m y you are an idiot because if you even slightly knew how to read you would have realized that i said heavyweight not a damn middleweight you moron lol nice try but way off buddy simple mike tyson you said all around package skill power and means to win a young prime time iron mike tyson had it all you can't categorize frazier of even marciano for that matter into this subject for the simple fact that both men lacked general skill but both did have the means to win even though mike lost the will to win later in his career he still had the complete package he was still fast powerful even if his skill level dropped a bit he was still dangerous alot of people think that mike's talent was over rated but it's all bull shit stop judging the man for his outside of the ring actions and start judging him for what he has done inside it mike would have destroyed marciano and frazier on his prime night so there for he is the better champ who was under ' mike had the best style for a fighter under feet in the peek a boo style no one did it better than him not even patterson who also perfected it but lacked the chin and will to survive if knocked down you can't think for one second that frazier or marciano were on a skill level like mike mike tyson is the final answer  Boxing Mike Tyson Rocky Marciano Archie Moore Evander Holyfield Joe Frazier Roy Jones Jr. Jersey Joe Walcott Heavyweight Joe Louis Muhammad Ali Lennox Lewis Sugar Ray Robinson Floyd Patterson George Foreman Shawn Michaels Larry Holmes Leon White Nelson Frazier, Jr. Michael Spinks Leon Spinks Mixed martial arts Lou Duva Jack Johnson (boxer) Professional wrestling match types A.J.

rocky marciano what if marciano had not retired after suffering his first real knockdown against moore but still wining the fight how would he have fared against the likes of floyd patterson muhammad ali and sonny liston do you think he would have won those fights or do you think he would have gone out worse of like two old pass their primes louis and moore did against the younger marciano if marciano was so good do you think he would have done well in his older years still fighting like louis and moore did or was he not that good enough stonewall jackson you are the idiot my friend you obviously don't know shit about boxing so go play with yourself in your room little child this is a question for people who know the sport of boxing and the sweet science behind it you are a complete fucking moron kid not only did marciano retire to early but fighting a way past his peak moore doesn't prove shit but that he can beat an old great just like every other young decent boxer could you are so fucking retarded buddy marciano was good but he wasn't great for he never proved shit against a great at his peak or even remotly close like ali for instance over and over ali proved how good he was he even beat liston when liston was still fresh get over yourself marciano isn't being picked on little child he is just being reviewed as a mis understood scared ass who wanted to make a few bucks in the boxing world but not run into any real danger fact now beat it loser great answer big e it seems like you are the only one to answer my question the way it should have been answered so far great job bro it's good to see that there are still some people who have common sense and the audacity to keep their composure and not get all bent over a question being aired online if anyone doesn't like it then why answer it i didn't ask for all these nut hanging marciano fans to come onto this question just to spit how much there asses hurt because they think it's offensive lol i am a marciano fan but do i get offended by what i see as a fact no thanks again simply put marciano was a decent fighter but by no means would i call him a great fighter he retired without putting a chapter of fighting a young and up and rising star like patterson in his book because patterson was young and eager marciano never fought a young eager fighter who was there to win and had the skill patterson's camp actually wanted a fight with marciano according to d'amoto even though marciano didn't fare to well against most of the heavyweights at that time ali liston ect he though he would do great against marciano marciano used somewhat of a peek a boo style if that's what you want to call what marciano was doing but patterson did it better with marciano being a tad bit shorter than patterson marciano would have quit a bit of trouble patterson stated that he liked to fight boxer his height or shorter because it suited him best for his style although i do see marciano beating patterson i don't see him beating him bad like everyone predicts or thinks have common sense you idiots patterson was a great boxer who utilized his style to his best and if d'amoto believed he had a chance against marciano then he did basically if marciano didn't take patterson out early then don't expect him to do it late patterson needs to jump on marciano early but if he decides to fall of his game plan and fight marciano's fight then expect him to get knocked the fuck out marciano vs patterson in my eyes could go either way now marciano vs liston lmfao not a chance i see this fight going the same way marciano put the ol mongoose out if liston doesn't knock marciano out cold early he will knock him down constantly liston had a powerful awkward right hand that came out of weird angles but he was accurate with it marciano would be eating those up all night because he lacked general defense if not by far some of the worse defense i have ever seen in a heavy liston vs marciano has bad news written all over it and i just don't see marciano surviving same thing with ali vs marciano a computer fight doesn't prove shit but that there are still stereotypes out there who think marciano is the greatest of all time he isn't or he would have came out of retirement to face ali for real the fact was my friend is that marciano didn't want to because he knew ali would hand him his ass marciano was too damn slow on his feet and ali was just too damn fast on his faster going backwards than marciano coming forward that jab would wear marciano down to a frustrated marciano who will eventually be throwing wild hay makers that wont even come close to hitting ali in a dangerous spot leaving himself open constantly and dragging himself marciano would become an easy and open target for ali to destroy although i don't see ali beating marciano like liston would ali for sure would beat marciano hands down marciano was good but he retired before he proved himself maybe if he would have fought patterson liston and ali and even if he didn't win he would have still gained allot more respect that means something he could have went on knowing that he fought some of the greats when they were still great i think that's what makes a fighter great marciano to tell you the truth wouldn't fare to well against any of the 's fighters including an 's iron mike i'd hate to see what foreman and mike would do to marciano lol can you imagine his face after a fight with these men bloody and swollen lol most likely some broken bones as well  Poker jargon New York Giants Shaggy dog

where do i punch someone if i want to knock them out in one punch please do not answer if you're just gonna say something like you need anger management serious answers only aim for the upper jaw if you're low you hit them on the lower jaw if you're high you drill the nose if you're off to the side you can still make contact with eye sockets what's most important is brain shake in order to do that you need follow through on your punch meaning you aim for the upper jaw but extend through the target as if you mean to hit something inches deeper the idea is to get the head swiveling around jarring the brain the last time i ever sparred i was nearly dropped by a punch that didn't hurt hung up the gloves after that my opponent stepped clockwise so i figured it was time to throw a lead right i didn't see what happened as i lost consciousness for a split second but i worked out what happened he baited me into throwing a lead right but he slipped the punch and brought up a hook that i didn't see my extended right partially blocked my peripheral view to the right and he put his hook right in that blind spot the hook came over my shoulder and hit the side of my right jaw not a lot of power but plenty of follow through since i didn't see the punch i wasn't set to take it and my head flopped degrees to the left i lost consciousness for less than a second and i a managed to stop myself from going down but i couldn't fight a lick after that no confidence all from a slight case of head shake  Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling attacks Boxing Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Punch (strike) Piccolo Junior Saga Muhammad Ali Tenshinhan Equine conformation The Contender (television series) Rigging Wing Chun Eye Poker jargon Darth Vader Volleyball Stopping power Mixed martial arts Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Professional wrestling match types Strike (attack) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Snooker Suplex Happy Tree Friends Worms weapons and tools Boxing training Guilty Gear Shaggy dog story Shen Gong Wu Doom enemies Vegeta EastEnders Indian Oil Cup 2005 Aikido Professional wrestling aerial techniques Terry Bogard Swingout Sin City USS Whale (SS-239) Characters of Naruto Martial art Terminal ballistics Shawn Michaels Milton H.

i know i'm punching a dead horse but what is your take on the mayorga vargas fight next month i like mayorga in this matchup vargas is an overweight out of shape mess who will likely have trouble making the weight unless it's sanctioned at lbs hahaha vargas is a beat up scarred shell of his former overratedness if he does manage to win he should be tested right afterward for drugs steroids ala barry bonds another cheating scumbag who can't win without drugs normally stonewall jackson has a pretty good head on his shoulders evidently i said something about his boyfriend and he got all mad at me so like any child he attacked me typical zero brained immature little baby hey stonewall it's called an opinion grow a brain and use it boy i think mayorga will knock him out in about or rounds theyre both really aggressive so it should be a slugfest but vargas is too out of shape in my opinion to do much damage mayorga will do what he did against forrest and trinidad let vargas hit him with clean shots in the face on purpose i think vargas might knock him down once but i see mayorga knocking down vargas a couple of times before the ref stops the fight mayorga in a tko in the battle of the has beens  Ricardo Mayorga F__lix Trinidad Boxing Mixed martial arts Fernando Vargas Terminal ballistics Sin City EastEnders Eddie Guerrero Ben Johnson (athlete) Mike Tyson Muhammad Ali Puberty Acne Vitali Klitschko Roy Jones Jr. October 2004 in sports Professional wrestling throws YuYu Hakusho Sonny Liston Stopping power Tupac Shakur September 2004 in sports Shoot boxing August 2005 in sports Bernard Hopkins John Ruiz Professional wrestling slang Shane Mosley Piccolo Junior Saga Stonewall Jackson Cosmic Era list of characters Betulio Gonz__lez Professional wrestling attacks Shotgun Alan Arnett McLeod PRIDE Tenshinhan St. Louis Cardinals Clinical depression Vegeta Yori Boy Campas Sugar Ray Robinson One Tree Hill (TV series) Johnny Tapia Barry Bonds Tank Breath of Fire III December 2004 in sports Sugar Ray Leonard Michael Watson Kodocha John Cena John F.
