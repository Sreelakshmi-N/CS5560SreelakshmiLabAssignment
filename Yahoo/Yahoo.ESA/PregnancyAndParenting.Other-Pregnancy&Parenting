what was your child's lead test result and how worried were you my month old had his test recently and it came back as a i'm kind of freaked out about it i read that and above is the level of concern but all of this research says that any amount could cause all of these horrible effects the only lead exposure i could think of would be the dust from some window sills that have some old lead paint under the newer paint which is peeling some it is not in a location where he can touch it and the peeling is not falling on the floor so i guess there could be some in the air when we first got the house i tested the paint on the window but not the paint below the surface paint i'm really beating myself up but the slightly elevated level could have been through contact with his toys living in a mining town near the interstate who knows let me know your experience thanks is ok my niece had a she's alright she moved out of the apartment they lived in because the landlord wouldn't do anything about it gave her a box of cascade dishwasher powder and told her to use that to scrub the walls daily my youngest came back i painted every unpainted wall in the house and had it retested months later and it went down to your baby is fine but i would definitely paint any and all walls and windows that haven't been painted in the last years or so just to be safe they can also come in contact with the lead dust in dirt outside so there isn't too much that you can do when it comes to that just make sure that you don't let him put his hands in his mouth when ya'll are outside and wash wash wash with warm soapy water everytime you come in and before eating or drinking anything if you have any of those toys that have been recalled because of lead paint get them back to the store for a refund you can google mattel toy recall and it gives you the whole list good luck isn't too much to worry about but being a mom it's hard not too just use precautions and he'll be just fine update everyone has some lead in their system it's natural the average normal is around so you see is quite normal it's when it gets closer to and above that it causes concern i would say in my professional opinion and in personal experience that if you know of things around your house that contain lead fix them now you probably won't be able to change out things like lead pipes and all of that but from what i hear as long as you don't use hot tap water for cooking then it should be ok  Kitchen Paint Sento Tattoo Nuclear fallout Milton H.

if i do not put my baby's fathers name on the birth certificate does he still have rights my unborn child's father chose to walk away even though this was a planned pregnancy he changed his cell phone number and does not even call to see if the pregnancy is going good i have made up my mind that i do not want him to have anything to do with my child so i am not going to put his name on the birth certificate if is obvious that he could really give a shit about this baby my question is if he wants any rights to see her will he have to pay for a paternity test and lawyer fees i dont want his support the welfare of my child is much more important and the father is a functional drunk and a loser with a job so unless he changes he is not fit to have my baby has anybody been through this before if the father is a loser with a job and a functional drunk why did you plan a pregnancy with him regardless of your opinion of him your child may be the one who wants to know his her father you cannot poison your child's mind about their father don't get me wrong he's a real jerk for leaving you but the fact is in years it's not your call courts can control the baby and parents for years but after that it's up to your child i'd put the father on the birth certificate if he wants involvement in the child's life you have no right to deny that your relationship is just that yours not his and the childs maybe he'll never come around but don't put your child through torture because of your experience with this guy  Abortion debate Pregnancy Friends Abortion Fathers' rights Abortion in the United States Breastfeeding In vitro fertilisation Fathers' rights movement in the UK Birth control Divorce Prenatal diagnosis EastEnders Roe v.

my husband's nervous about having kids i'm ready what should i do he wants kids he just really nervous about it if he wants kids and it's just a case of him being nervous don't worry about it most men have a lot less experience with babies and small children than women do even in this day and age teenage girls not boys are sought after to babysit little girls not boys are the target audience for babydolls it's natural to be nervous of something you know little about especially something so fragile and so dependant on you as a baby is my husband was terrified of the idea of even holding my oldest son until he went to the nursery to bring him to our room i actually had to give him a peptalk to go down there and get him and i remember the conversation ended with if you don't think you can carry him just bring the crib down or ask a nurse to carry the baby then i had to literally ask him to give me the baby because he came in the room holding my son with the nurse tagging along behind crib in tow and sat down in the chair across the room just to marvel at the newborn and i think to marvel at the fact that he was indeed able to carry him without freaking out educate your husband some either with a book a parenting class for the two of you to take or by encouraging a man he respects to form a kind of mentor relationship with him i would suggest all three that way he can learn about the terms and the theories of child rearing he can have practical training in parenting duties like bathing and diaper changing and knowing what to expect of the baby and he has someone other than you he can go to for questions plus another man can tell him the things we women take for granted like that the newborn's head has a soft spot that will pulsate my husband actually informed my brothers in law of this it freaked him out because he didn't know it would happen or that even newborn boys get erections a phenomonon that can be fascinating and repulsive to a man at the same time if you think about it being nervous is a good thing the nervous dads to be are the ones who do everything they can to protect their wife or partner in pregnancy and childbirth and who put forth the most effort to be ready for the baby after he or she is born talk to him let him know it's okay to be nervous he'll have nine months to get ready make sure that it's just nervous not actual doubts about being ready to have a baby if he still feels like he's ready to have a baby but is just nervous about everything be encouraging and supportive in many ways he's even newer at this than you are  Childbirth Breastfeeding Infantilism Abortion debate EastEnders Pregnancy Shaggy dog story Urinary incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.

parents how would you feel about this ok this happened a couple of years ago but i was just wondering what you all thought about this my cousin married a woman that had children one lives with them the other with his dad my cousin has child from a previous relationship and they now have one together a blended family anyways his wifes son the one who lives with his dad started calling my cousin dad well his dad found out and got mad and said something about it to my cousin my cousin said listen together we have children all of the others call me dad i love your son and i don't want him to feel left out by having him call me by my name instead of dad what difference does it make if your son loves one more person and one more person that loves him it will just give him one more person to rely on and look up to the other guy agreed and said that he was sorry for getting all upset he saw my cousins point of view how would you of reacted in this situation my cousin really does love him he use to help with his homework but now he is so smart that no one understands it anymore and he doesn't need help anyways he is now and my cousin is teaching him how to drive a stick and lets him drive his car takes him places and goes to his school stuff just like any other parent it would be painful at first to have my daughter call another woman mom but if the woman has my daughter's interests in mind and loves her too i really can't complain  Friends Grandview, U.S.A.

i need idead asap when i got pregnant i am currently weeks i got the entire family history on my mothers side from my grandma within about an hours time period one of the things she mentioned was that her brother was born a mongloid because my great grandma came in contact with someone who had german measles he then died about a week after he was born from natural causes after hearing this i did some research online so i had an idea what i needed to be looking for that way if i got it i knew rather sooner then later anyhow this morning at work i m a receptionist a lady came in with red bumps all over her face you could tell she had been scratching them her face was all bleeding now i didn t want to be rude and ask her what those were from but that is one of the first physical signs of the german measles now i again i don t know for sure if she has that or not but what do you all think i should do if in fact she did i want to make sure i didn t catch it any ideas i wasnt trying to be rude by what i had called him that is just the name that the doctors gave him when he was born i didnt know how else to tell you what he had without saying it like that but no i wasnt trying to be rude in anyway from what i was told my great grandma caught it at the end of her st trimester i know that you have to have touched some form of droplet from them to contact it but she had blood all over her fingers from the scratching and i had to take something from her i m not trying to be over dramatic but this is my nd pregnancy with my st ending in a miscarriage so i really can t help but worry about things you should ask your mom if she knows if you were ever vaccinated for it it's a very rare occurance that a pregnant woman contracts it because most people these days have been vaccinated if you haven't been vaccinated for it there still is a very good chance you will not get it it isn't as contageous as say chicken pox or other kinds of measles it is spread in an airborn droplet form so the lady probably had to actually sneeze on you for you to get it from what i understand symptoms don't show up until or weeks from exposure so you really won't know if you contracted it or not for a while if i were you i'd contact my doctor and tell him about it at the very least your doctor will be able to ease your mind more than any of us could and watch you for symptoms but like i said it is very rare i really wouldn't worry too much about it best of luck edited to add i just read your added details and that is soooo disgusting how could that woman just sit there with blood on her hands passing things back and forth to people god only knows what's in her blood geesh some people are just ridiculous it sounds like you need a stash of rubber gloves and hand sanitizer when dealing with our clients they obviously have no respect for other people's health and you don't have to explain about why you're worried about this you're just trying to protect your little bundle there's no shame in that whatsoever i wish you the best of luck with the rest of your pregnancy i'm sure it will be a very healthy successful happy pregnancy with a perfect little cutie once it's all over with if you need anything else feel free to email me i have an month old and another on the way take care  Smallpox Miscarriage Pregnancy Measles Ebola Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Theory of conduct EastEnders Childbirth Menstrual cycle Abortion debate Breastfeeding Autism Cytomegalovirus Obstetrics Abortion in the United States Prostate cancer Group A streptococcal infection Abortion AIDS Milton H.

what is personal lubricant im a teen found this in the drawer what is it for the above answer went off the deep end early on didn't it it's an artificial lubricant to make your vagina slippery so that a man's penis can slip in and out of it easily you produce your own lubricant there when you get sexually aroused but some women don't produce enough or don't produce it soon enough especially when they get older also you usually always have a certain amount of lubricant in your vagina and the inside of your vulva but if you don't produce enough and that area dries out it can itch and hurt and feel uncomfortable so some adult women need a supplement just from day to to day whether or not they need it for sex  Vagina Oral sex Condom Strap-on dildo Sexual intercourse Vaginal lubrication Sex toy Human sexual behavior Anal sex Masturbation Dyspareunia Menstrual cup Personal lubricant Sexual dysfunction Pornographic movie Vulvovaginal health Human sexuality Intersex surgery Orgasm Sex organ Androgen insensitivity syndrome Pubic hair Sexual arousal Puberty Herbert Garrison Safe sex Vagina dentata Child sexuality Human sexual response cycle Gay slang Penis Fertility awareness Sexual differentiation Rape Gliding action Domestic violence Fecal incontinence Physical intimacy Human penis size Masters and Johnson Female ejaculation Pornography in Japan Female genital cutting Premature ejaculation Prostate cancer Butt plug Herpes simplex virus Anus Menstrual cycle Clitoris Breathing gas Penis envy Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Sexual reproduction Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female Pedophilia Fisting Sanitary towel Hormone replacement therapy (trans) One Tree Hill (TV series) History of intersex surgery Gonorrhoea Pornography Social rule Sex doll Erogenous zone Group sex Abortion debate Anal masturbation Medical analysis of circumcision Man Goatse.cx Sex assignment Sexual fetishism Bon Jovi Gender role Biology and sexual orientation Sexual attraction Marilyn Monroe Friction Transsexuality Sex education Mucus Inflation fetishism Virgin Small penis humiliation Cervical cancer Smegma Bondage (BDSM) Genital wart Intersexuality Sexual orientation Age of consent Theory of conduct Gender identity Micropenis Penis removal

what is personal lubricant lube is short for lubricant it refers to a variety of products that can be used to make the vagina slippery and sex more enjoyable these are useful for women who don't produce enough natural lubricant and they can also help prevent condoms from breaking as for what they are made of there are probably as many formulas as there are products water based lubricants such as k y jelly wet or astroglide contain water and some other substance to make them slippery they can also contain flavours colours perfumes and spermicides if you wish however some of these things can irritate the vagina so experiment carefully oils like vaseline or massage oil can also make the vagina slippery but these products break down the latex in condoms making them more likely to break lastly saliva can act as a lubricant and may be fun to apply but it tends to dry up more quickly than some of the commercial products saliva is a body fluid and oral sex does involve some risk of transmitting infection hope this helps  Condom Anal sex Oral sex Birth control Menstrual cup Human sexual behavior Fisting Sexual intercourse Sex toy Strap-on dildo Fertility awareness Vaginal lubrication Motor oil Orgy Butt plug Herpes simplex virus Friction Masturbation Petroleum jelly Unsafe sexual practices Diaphragm (contraceptive) Breastfeeding Sexually-transmitted infection Anal masturbation Pornographic movie Dyspareunia Psoriasis Methamphetamine Hemp Nonoxynol-9 Vulvovaginal health Group sex Gay bathhouse Cytomegalovirus Tattoo Perfume Paint Genital wart Nutmeg Body piercing Vagina Roman Catholic Church Cervical cancer Intersex surgery AIDS Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Gonorrhoea Hiking Human sexuality Massage Gay slang Douche Puberty Mosquito Intravenous therapy Vulva Physical intimacy Prostitution Barebacking Pneumonia Honey Casting Carbon dioxide Oral contraceptive Rape Sexual dysfunction Prostate cancer Laxative Torture HIV Sento Grease (lubricant) Menstrual cycle Candidiasis Hazing Sex education Thermal power station Lactobacillus acidophilus Multiple sclerosis Tears Medical analysis of circumcision Tampon Acne Pottery Soap Childbirth First aid Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Malaria Glycerin Drill bit Food preservation Mucus

what's it like being a single parent what's your experience is it really hard would you do it again know any websites that might give good advice thanks i actually enjoy being a single parent for the past years i was young too it isn't a piece of cake and if i had to do it all over again i wouldn't jump to pick being a single parent but it isn't horrible or the end of the world i found a schedule that worked for me and my kids yr triplets we made sacrifices on both sides and worked together as a family to get things done i went to work while they went to school when i got home i multitasked between doing household chores making dinner making phone calls and helping them with homework i don't know how i did it but i did they were each allowed to do one after school activity and i carpooled with other moms to get them to and from it was stressful at times especially when they were younger trying to get three kids up dressed fed and out the door for school and at night getting homework done getting them fed and showed there were certain activities like school clothing food shopping etc that i wish i had an extra adult to come with me while i took them and sometimes i would take the teenager down the street and she helped me a lot with them i had friends and family close by that helped if i needed it i think if you set your mind to believing you can do this trust your gut feelings about certain things learn the importance of time and to multitask you'll be able to get what needs to be done and do what you want to do the most as a single parent spend time with your kids i would look into the website http www geocities com maryaskmenow askaway html i see some woman is telling people all about it and mary woman from the website is a lot of help best wishes  The Fairly OddParents Friends Codename: Kids Next Door Computer multitasking Social rule Kodocha Little Britain Shaggy dog story The Adventures of Pete & Pete W.I.T.C.H.

iv got the baby blues any advice iv been with my bf n a half years he has kids already hes im i know he doesnt want any more kids as hes told me plenty of time the women hes had kids with have fkd off aferwards and hes either not seen the kids the the case of his youngest for a year might not be his child or the mothers have not been interested two eldest for years mother didnt see them eldest is deffo not his biologically i thought id be ok with it but i feel really down and kinda want a child with my bf will this go away and any have any ideas if its just me he doesnt want to have one with or its just coz of the past i ask him but all i get out of him is i just don't he has the same oppinion on marriage and i just wanna know if any else has had this any other men felt this way then please reply too i would like both sides of the story thank you x dee ann he was the one that braught the two eldest up for years whilst there mother fkd off and he braught the youngest up on his own untill her mum decided to move away and marry another bloke so he was more than just a sperm doner he's definitely scared and he has every right to be his track record involving women and kids is terrible and not necessarily his doing i don't think his decision has anything to do with you and i'm not one to bring age into a relationship but when you were still in school and he had kids by the time he was that's alot for a person of his age to go through i'm and i'm only on my first child and unfortunately for you he's associating marriage children with negativity to be truthfully honest i don't think there is anything you can do to change his mind a relationship is supposed to be about compromise and if he's not willing to budge or at least talk about his preferences your relationship is going nowhere and fast and i'm speaking from personal experience on that one you have to know what you want out of life and to set time frames and goals for yourself you don't want to wake up years from now and realize your entire youth was a waste good luck dear  About a Boy Little Britain Friends Knots Landing Time Out of Mind Milton H.

what are some thoughts on immunizing your child pros and cons husband and i are having differences wow i am so shocked at the sheep mentality here people blindly trusting that these things are safe do your research most of the diseases that the us vaccinates immunize is a misnomer if they actually made you immune you would not need boosters for are minor and normal childhood diseases that once had provide immunity for life the drug companies and the government are in cahoots they each get big money out of the deal the doctors push it too because they pay for those vaccines and they must be used before the expiration or they lose money did you notice the huge tv campaign to vaccinate young girls against vd with a vaccine that we have no data as to the long term effects it may have on their fertility did you know congress passed a law eliminating liability of the drug companies for vaccine injuries see below do you actually know what is in many of the vaccines did you know there is mercury and formaldehyde did you know there is aborted fetal tissue see below yahoo groups has a great group for information and articles related to this issue join vaccinations and read up see below by the way every state in the us has exemptions for children entering school you can find them online see below don't be a sheep do your research and decide for yourself  Vaccine Thimerosal MMR vaccine Vaccination 2000 Simpsonwood CDC conference Malaria Controversies in autism Vaccine controversy AIDS Autism epidemic Allergy Anthrax Rabies Medicine HIV vaccine Homeopathy Abortion National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act Antiviral drug Herpes simplex virus Abortion in the United States Mathematical modelling in epidemiology Cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus HIV Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System Poliomyelitis Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Mercury (element) Mark Geier Microeconomics Alzheimer's disease Childbirth Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Medical cannabis Public domain Jonas Salk Measles David Kirby Streptococcus pneumoniae The Apprentice 2 Pharmaceutical company Surveillance A-CHAMP Stem cell Autism rights movement Duesberg hypothesis Dave Weldon Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Medical record Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Medical analysis of circumcision United States Postal Service Bioterrorism Cerebral palsy Health care in the United States Civil rights Sleeping sickness Food and Drug Administration Sickle-cell disease Child sexuality Miscarriage Endometriosis Tort reform Contract Influenza Natural Hygiene Ethics OPV AIDS hypothesis Epilepsy U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Marburg virus Hepatitis Abortion debate Medical malpractice Autistic enterocolitis National Health Service Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Shark Intact dilation and extraction Herpes zoster Tobacco smoking

breastfeeding and supplementing with formula need some answers please im breastfeeding but also supplementing with bottles i feed my son from each breast and then give him the rest with formula he doesnt get full from my breastmilk alone big baby at birth i would like to feed my baby more breastmilk then formula and wondering is there anything i can do to make a lot more milk to fill him up any safe supplements or any way just in general pls help thanks nurse or pump frequently plan to nurse at least every to hours during the day and at least every hours at night even if you must awaken your baby time your feedings from the beginning of one to the beginning of another if your baby is available to nurse this is preferable to pumping as he will better stimulate your breasts to produce more milk allow the baby to nurse on each side until he pulls off himself or goes to sleep offer both breasts at each feeding although nursing is preferable if the baby cannot nurse directly at the breast use a hospital grade electric pump for double pumping instead such as the lactina or pump in style double pumping has been shown to increase prolactin levels prolactin is the hormone which stimulates milk production pump for minutes per session longer sessions have not been proven to be any more beneficial at increasing supply along with nursing you may want to add another pumping session or two sometime during your day you also may want to add a few extra minutes of pumping after the baby has finished nursing allow the baby to meet all of his sucking needs at the breast avoid any bottles or pacifiers during this time your baby's need to suck ensures that he spends adequate time at the breast to stimulate your supply avoid supplements including solid food water juice and formula adding these will result in your baby nursing less often and you getting less stimulation you can be sure that your baby is getting enough by counting his wet diapers and bowel movements see is my baby getting enough if your baby requires a supplement for medical reasons consider using a nursing supplementer at your breast so that you can continue to receive crucial baby stimulation snack often on foods rich in protein and calcium drink enough to satisfy your thirst forcing fluids is not necessary and may have the opposite effect any type of fluid is satisfactory rest as much as you can consider taking the baby to bed with you for the time period the rest will benefit you and the close skin to skin contact may encourage him to nurse more often some mothers have found that the herb fenugreek is helpful for increasing milk supply it works best when combined with increased frequency of nursing and or pumping you can find it at your local health food store or nutrition store the dosage is capsules times a day most moms notice an increase in supply after using it days it is safe for your baby while taking it you may notice that your perspiration and urine smell like maple syrup as fenugreek is used to give artificial maple syrup its odor some moms report diarrhea while taking it that quickly resolves once they stop taking it if you suffer from asthma your symptoms may become worse with the fenugreek dosages higher than the recommended one given above may result in hypoglycemia in some mothers if pregnant you should not use fenugreek as it may cause uterine contractions many moms use it for a quick boost to their supplies others have used it long term with no problems other herbs often recommended for increasing milk supply are blessed thistle and alfalfa for some mothers a combination of herbs seems to work better than one herb alone you may use the fenugreek blessed thistle and alfalfa in combination if you choose if the above measures do not cause a significant increase in your supply you may want to ask your doctor about reglan metoclopramide a prescription drug available in the us and sometimes prescribed for low milk supply reglan is most effective at doses of mg times a day and should not be used for any longer than weeks if you have a history of depression reglan should be avoided due to its potential side effects of depression and mood swings  Cancer Psoriasis Premature birth Infant Sleep Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Infant formula Chronic fatigue syndrome Bipolar disorder Abortion Coeliac disease Breast milk

long story what do you think am i preg i think that i may be pregnant but i am not sure yet let me tell you my story ok so i had my last period on june th i am on a day cycle and wasnt expecting my period until aug st on july th around the time i was ovulating i had sex with my b f and we used a condom it had spermaside on it but when we finished we couldnt find the condom after looking around for min we gave up well about an hour later i went to the bathroom and pulled the condom out from inside me it was empty so i assume that the sperm was inside me well on the of july i had some light brown spotting the next full day i had the same thing but then on the th i started what i thought was my period well it was a bit lighter than my normal period and it only lasted days then went back to two more days of spotting do you think i could be pregnant i never spot between periods and i usually have a really heavy one but this wasnt like that and i have been having a constant ache in my lower back i have felt a bit sick on and off have been having some breast tenderness also i took a first response hpt yesterday and it was negative but i didn t take it in the morning so my hcg levels were probably very low i took one again this morning and it was also negative do you think that i am not prego or should i wait and test again if i am pregnant then i would be about weeks along thanks girl i feel your pain i found this on the internet hope it helps many women experience spotting at some point during their cycle be in after the major bleeding period in the middle or days before their period is due there are times when it's perfectly normal to spot and there are times when spotting is an indication of something wrong be it minor or major first let's define spotting spotting is when a bit of blood is passed through the vagina normally it doesn't reach the underwear but rather is swiped with toilet paper after a bowel movement or urination the blood can be pink tinged mucus rusty brown or bright red spotting can be a one time occurrence or it can last for several hours or even several days spotting does not define the first day of menstruation the first day of menstruation should always be the first day of actual bleeding normal spotting normal spotting is what may occur at the very end of your bleeding days a day or two of spotting after to days of bleeding is normal and just the end of the bleeding period spotting that occurs in the middle of your cycle or spotting that occurs some ten to fourteen days prior to the start of the next cycle is normal too this spotting may occur during ovulation seeing a spot of blood during ovulation is considered an excellent fertility sign it is thought that mid cycle spotting occurs for one of two reasons first reason is possibly that when the egg bursts through the follicle a little bleeding may occur this blood will then make its way out and show up as spotting or during ovulation the level of estrogens rise and this sometimes prompts the uterus to shed a bit of lining which shows up in the form of spotting spotting that occurs about a week before the cycle is due and only lasts for less than one day is possibly considered implantation spotting this happens as a result of the fertilized egg burrowing into the uterine lining or another reason for seeing implantation spotting may be due to a slight rise in estrogen and drop in progesterone before the corpus luteum takes over the production of progesterone the corpus luteum takes over the production when the implanted fertilized egg signals the body that pregnancy has occurred and that the lining must be maintained keep in mind that spotting that continues for days is not implantation spotting abnormal spotting abnormal spotting shows up at times other than the above mentioned times abnormal spotting lasts for days it's abnormal to spot days before your menstrual cycle is due the causes of abnormal spotting vary one common cause of spotting several days before the menstrual cycle is due is low progesterone it's the hormone progesterone that helps to maintain the uterine lining for pregnancy and when progesterone level drops the menstrual cycle occurs in women who are deficient in progesterone they will see spotting several days to a week before their cycle is due this can also cause minor infertility and early miscarriag another reason spotting may occur could be uterine fibroids which are fairly harmless but need to be kept an eye on endometriosis birth control pills are a few other reasons spotting may occur the most harmful reasons for spotting are possible sexually transmitted diseases and some cancers it is advisable if you have re curring spotting each month to have your healthcare provider to exam you just to rule out possible harmful reasons for it and to help you to deal with and or cure the reasons behind the spotting  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Gynaecology Lipoid congenital adrenal

how safe is birth control i want to go on birth control however i am concerned about health threats such as blood clots also i am not crazy about the idea of gaining weight what are the health threats caused by birth control and will i gain a lot of weight also i heard that after i get off of birth control i will have a hard time getting pregnant another concern is also pregnancy while on birth control what are the chances of getting pregnant while using bc and a condom at the same time hormonal birth control does have risks such as blood clots as you mentioned however some forms have lower risks than others basically the lower the hormone dose the lower the risk but that is an over generalization the patch particularly in the us seems to have one of the highest rates of complications it also has the highest level of estrogen in canada and other places for some reason the patch has lower hormone levels depo provera is also extremely high risk and has the greatest risk of effecting future fertility the nuvaring has less hormones than the standard birth control pill and as such should have lower risks mirena is very effective and the side effects are low as well there is no evidence that hormonal birth control when taken as prescribed increases the risks of birth defects or problems during pregnancy the risk of getting pregnant while using the pill and condom assuming you use both correctly is near but crazier things have happened talk to your doctor a nurse a pharmacist and or planned parenthood to get a better idea of which method may be right for you then go online and get the patient information packet for each method you are considering and do more research yourself to look into the risks and benefits  Birth control Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Folic acid Tocopherol Fertility awareness Prostate cancer Emergency contraception Urinary incontinence Abortion Hormone replacement therapy Menstrual cycle Depo Provera Condom Obstetrics Cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Growth hormone treatment Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Turner syndrome In vitro fertilisation Stroke Breastfeeding Diabetes mellitus Endometriosis Prolactinoma Herpes simplex virus Osteoporosis Traumatic brain injury Psoriasis Sex education Premature birth Organic food COX-2 inhibitor Ectopic pregnancy Nutrition Puberty Abortion debate Insulin Paracetamol Isotretinoin Medicine Cryptorchidism Maprotiline Aspirin Progesterone Tobacco smoking Miscarriage Clinical depression Atherosclerosis Blood pressure Coeliac disease Malaria Methamphetamine Obesity Safe sex Multiple sclerosis Acne Pregnancy Guinea pig Diethylstilbestrol Polycystic ovary syndrome Cardiovascular disease Gonorrhoea Teenage pregnancy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Medical analysis of circumcision Vitamin C Organic farming Transsexuality Breast cancer Caffeine Prenatal diagnosis Migraine Haloperidol DDT Depleted uranium Paroxetine Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Nicotine Growth hormone Spina bifida Cytomegalovirus Sexual abstinence Postpartum depression Pulmonary embolism Antiretroviral drug Ovarian cancer Myocardial infarction Alternative medicine

severe seperation anxiety help my yr old son and i are very close i nanny and he attends work with me everyday and has recently started sleeping in my bed he refuses to sleep unless i lay with him although we move him back into his bed if we can manage to stay awake while trying to get him to sleep he will remain asleep there until am or so i basically do not spend a single moment of my day wihtout him by my side often i have no choice he is getting to the point to where he tells me no when i i have to use the restroom and will sometimes try to push me off the toilet or make me hold him while i am on the toilet punishement is doled out for the former offence i am not sure what to do i have tried ferberizing i have tried no cry solutions my poor dear will scream until he shakes violently and uncontrolably it scares me and i am not a mother who scares or gives in easily i am pregnant with my second and need to do something now before the next one arrives thank you for all your help my goodness you do need help no one can live like you are living you need alone time to recharge your mommy batteries during the daytime when you need to be apart from your little one if it's for just a minute or a few hours the logic is the same he is screaming and crying because he knows mama will give him what he wants when you need to use the restroom set him down and say mommy will be right back in one minute then simply walk away if he screams and cries and tries to hold on to you ignore him he will learn that these actions will not be rewarded then when you return reward him for his independence give him a warning say if you don't let go of mommy and let me do the dishes use the bathroom etc then you will sit on time out for minutes then let him decide same basic principal for nighttime it is plain and simple don't give in if you give lots of hugs and kisses and then place him in bed and then ignore him for the rest of the night i promise he will not cry for hours he will probably cry until he realises that he's not getting what he wants and then he'll go to sleep then if you reward him in the morning for sleeping independently he will learn how to please mommy which of course is what every child wants you sound like a wonderful mom and i'm sure he's a wonderful child if you follow my advice carefully i promise that before long you will have moved past this separation anxiety and insecurity and on to the next thing as parents we always seem to move right from one thing to the next  Urinary incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) EastEnders Dog training Milton H.

stuffed animal arrangement my son has acquired a mass collection of lovely stuffed animals ranging in sizes anywhere from pillow sized to hamster sized they are all gifts from special people and i would like to have them out for him to use but i dont want them to take up a ton of space i need them to stay relatively organized and easy to move clean but i am not interested in using the traditional animal nets that hang from the corner of the ceiling and the chains with clips to hang the animals from are tacky any new unconventional ideas points will be issued to best answer thank you i use grib cubbies you connect them together to make a cubby shelf and use little plastic bins for small toys it keeps everything off the floor but where they can get to it and you can make it as large or small as you want or another way of doing it is get plastic cube containers like milk crates spray paint them different colors and connect and stack them together  Hamster Plastic Christmas tree My Little Pony Vermicompost Dairy Tofu Kitchen Pet skunk Traditional animation Regular polytope Comanche Japanese tea ceremony Strap-on dildo Seismic retrofit Wilton House Floppy disk Library Mattress Calvin and Hobbes Knife Gramophone record G.I.

baby shower i m helping plan my baby shower and i have a few things that i would like others opinions on i would like a little advice from some mothers mothers to be who have had baby showers or some of you who have given baby showers what would be an ideal number of people to invite to a baby shower the location where i m having my baby shower is a nice size when should i have a baby shower i was thinking about having my shower on oct th i will be wks at this time is that pushing it a little too close to my due date should i have it a week or two earlier what s a good time for the shower to start i was thinking about pm should i do it at little earlier or later than that invite as many people as you have the space for a lot even those with good intentions will end up not showing up so don't be afraid to go crazy with the invites weeks is cutting it close too close first off you're going to be huge and miserable second that doesn't leave you hardly any time to wash everything and get everything ready third that doesn't leave any time for you to buy what you still need or even take back the stuff that you got that you don't need the cleaning and preparing of the nursery then figuring out what you still need then writing out those thank you letters etc it all takes energy that you just won't have at weeks i would say around weeks would be ideal but hey you know you best i would say a little earlier just because pm is smack in the middle of the day i would say around noonish or pm what's most important is that you just do what you want to do it's all about you that's the point so just whatever you're most comfortable with is what needs to be done o congrats  Social rule Humphrey Bogart The Apprentice 2 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hey Jude Breastfeeding The Ashlee Simpson Show Charmed Kodocha The McGuire Sisters Neighbours Phoebe Buffay's songs Beatles for Sale The Emancipation of Mimi Knots Landing Friends The Contender (television series) The Catcher in the Rye Milton H.

in abortions cant they first kill the fetus with injection and then suck it out isnt c section nicer i'm asking this and i still didnt got the answer i want why they have to suck out the baby while its still alive why cant they use some injection to kill the fetus and just take it out through c section isnt this much more nicer to do if they have to do they can shoot the baby full of saline solution that will kill the baby then you go through labor to push the baby out but i think the bigger question here is and you said it yourself why do they suck the baby out while it is still alive with you saying that does that not make it murder these people who have and give abortions do not see the baby as human so they justify their actions buy calling the baby a fetus there for they can say it is not a viable living person but they are wrong and they will find out in the end murder is murder no matter what kind of label you give it oh and they do not give a c section because then it will make the baby seem more real to the mother  Abortion debate Intact dilation and extraction Abortion Pregnancy Theory of conduct Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Abortion in the United States Person Partial-birth abortion Childbirth Abortion in Canada Fetus Religion and abortion Roe v.

is it everybody's right to have children i know this is a very touchy issue so i'll try and tread carefully if someone finds out that biologically they can't have children they feel they've had their basic human 'right' to reproduce taken away from them is that the case do you think or should they just accept that it's not a right to have children and if it's not meant to be then they should accept that no matter how difficult that is and no matter how hard it is to see chavs popping out kids all over with different mothers fathers for example i didn't actually say that i agreed or disagreed i was just asking i personally don't agree with you i think that if someone can't have children biologically then perhaps the lord made it that way so that wonderful couple can adopt a baby that needs good parents  Adoption Abortion debate Family Infant baptism Polyamory Marriage Fathers' rights Infantilism Theory of conduct Contract Science Intelligent design Who is a Jew?

what is your reminder when your baby is in the back seat so you do not forget them having read another story of another baby who died because they were forgotten in the back seat in this summer weather and then was found dead i thought of a simple idea as a reminder using a velcro strip through a pacifier we fasten it on the steering wheel to make absolute certain that we would never forget that beloved baby when our minds were elsewhere what do you do our lives are so busy these days it is amazing how we can forget the most important things in our lives most of us thiink this would never happen to us and of those it has happen to i am certain they thought it would never happen to them but when your baby is sleeping and good as gold and your mind in thinking of a million things it obviously can happen and i do not believe it only happens to bad parents i understand the ugly responses but we all need to remember any of us can make mistakes since i never left my children and they are adults now and their children are nearly adults i just felt if this reminder saved one little one any where it was worth the arrogant responses it never hurts to err on the side of safety i like putting the purse or briefcase in the back that would be a great reminder i would like to be like everyone else and say that i could never have forgotten my baby in the car but i'm not entirely sure that's true i never did forget him in the car but i might have there is one morning in particular that i'm remembering i have a long commute to work and my son's daycare is on the way he was almost two when one day i just forgot to drop him off at daycare i don't know how i forgot i just did i suppose i was thinking about something and just forgot to turn off the road and drop him off it was such a part of the routine that it's impossible to distinguish one memory of dropping off from any other anyway i was already miles down the road pulling off the expressway to go to my job when he started babling at me at first i didn't think anything of it i'm a single mom and my son is with me so constantly that often i see him in the rearview mirror or hear his voice even when he's not really there this time though it wasn't a passing laugh or something like that he kept babbling at me and i realized that i had forgotten to drop him off i was so embarassed i had to go in and tell my boss i was going to be a couple of hours late because i had to go all the way back to the daycare at the same time i was so relieved that he hadn't fallen asleep on the trip or something like that i was so convinced that he was already at daycare that i may not have noticed he was asleep in his carseat my son is three and a half now so that was ages ago yet i still find myself checking his seat several times on the way to work each morning to make absolutely sure i rembered to drop him off i'm super paranoid about it now  Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jon Secada Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Amber Spyglass Paul Is Dead About a Boy Pitaten Friends Milton H.

what is your reminder when your baby is in the back seat so you do not forget them having read another story of another baby who died because they were forgotten in the back seat in this summer weather and then was found dead i thought of a simple idea as a reminder using a velcro strip through a pacifier we fasten it on the steering wheel to make absolute certain that we would never forget that beloved baby when our minds were elsewhere what do you do our lives are so busy these days it is amazing how we can forget the most important things in our lives you know i don't think the other posters are right i feel very strongly that i could not forget my child in the backseat however i am positive the people that did leave their child in the backseat felt the same way it's obviously not planned you never know how hectic your life is going to be it scares me that everyone on here thinks it can't happen to them and that's probably why it does happen so whereas i would like to say it would never happen that wouldn't stop me from taking precautions  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jon Secada About a Boy Theory of conduct The Amber Spyglass Time Out of Mind Friends History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Charmed Avenue Q Shaggy dog story The Lovely Bones Children of Dune The Family from One End Street Scenes from a Memory Pitaten Father's Day (Doctor Who) Kodocha Derren Brown Infantilism Social rule The Emancipation of Mimi Leo Wyatt Screenwriting Romulus and Remus Blonde on Blonde Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Theodicy StarCraft: Uprising AFI 100 Years series Transactional analysis The nature of God in Western theology Philosophical skepticism EastEnders W.

contraceptive pill or stick with the rhythm method posted this in womens health but havent received any answers yet i'm yrs old have been sexually active for yrs with the same partner we live together today i went to get my first prescription for the pill we've been using the rhythm method for three years and though i know it's not perfect we haven't yet had any scares i told the dr i wanted to go on the pill for everything contraceptive pimple control to lighten up my periods they're normally extremely heavy painful and that i wanted to try yasmin but he prescribed me levlen instead reading up about it i'm concerned about the number of women who have experienced a sudden rash of acne have become moody or gone off sex or even gone off their partners all together some people have even become pregnant on it should i bother taking it i have never become pregnant on the rhythm method i dont want to mess up my cycle for no reason what's your experience with the pill or rhythm method i had lots of trouble with the pill which i went on long before i was sexually active to help with my periods i went through different brands before i ended up getting pregnant after i switched to a th brand after having a heavy week long period on yasmin i never had any acne weight gain mood swing reactions on any of the brands my only problem with them all was they did not regulate my period it was still painful heavy and as unscheduled as ever i never tried the rhythm method because with my irregularity i never have any idea when i might be ovulating or not if you're doing it successfully i don't see any problem with continuing what you're going but the rhythm method is probably the single most unreliable method of birth control so unless you could support a child if you did happen to get pregnant i would use a back up method it doesn't have to be the pill it can be condoms spermicide the shot or even the patch whatever you like what i use now is an iud i have the mirena brand which can be left in place for up to years it's been in a year and a half now according to the doctors and all the research i did on it before i had it inserted it's got a better success rate than surgical sterilization  Oral contraceptive Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Emergency contraception Acne Condom Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sexual abstinence Intrauterine device Pregnancy Abortion Abortion debate Sexual intercourse Sex education Puberty Methamphetamine Baldness treatments Oral sex Safe sex Miscarriage Menstrual cup Endometriosis Prostate cancer Guinea pig Childbirth Sexual revolution Psoriasis Depo Provera Polycystic ovary syndrome Antidepressant Isotretinoin Teenage pregnancy Urinary incontinence EastEnders Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Diaphragm (contraceptive) AIDS Herpes simplex virus Masturbation In vitro fertilisation Maprotiline Obstetrics History of sex Malaria Clinical depression Electrophysiology Ovarian cyst Eugenics Alanis Morissette Paroxetine Androgen insensitivity syndrome Medical analysis of circumcision Folic acid Transactional analysis Migraine Tattoo Sleep Growth hormone treatment Apollo 8 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Medical prescription Infantilism Borderline personality disorder Gonorrhoea Sex toy Coitus interruptus Medicine Human sexual behavior Child sexuality Harm reduction Theodicy Ovulation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Human sexuality Tobacco smoking Central processing unit Sterilization (surgical procedure) Human penis size Margaret Sanger Cannabis (drug) Strap-on dildo Schizophrenia Caffeine Feminist movement Premature ejaculation Pornographic movie

what do you do when your child throws a fit do you ignore them give them what they want what any tips you do not give an age so what you do really needs to be appropriate to their understanding and level of development as a mother of two boys and i will tell you that based on my personal experience and what i have seen with others never ever give in to your children when they throw a fit because what seems like a quick and easy solution will come back to haunt you in a big way all kids will try to push the boundaries as a way of developing independence and younger children often act out because they cannot express themselves so keeping that in mind try not to react in anger if they dont get a reaction out of you they are usually less likely to use this method so basically start by ignoring the behaviour as long as they are not in physical danger let them be and let them know when they are ready to behave ask nicely apologize or fill in the blank you will be waiting over there wherever as long as you have visual contact and are within safe distance that alone might startle them into behaving and you may get some stares depending where you are but people who have children or deal with them will actually be quite sympathetic and understand exactly what you are doing so dont feel embarrassed when it is done first acknowledge that they are angry frustrated i see that you were very angry just now because you didnt get second let them know that this is unacceptable and that they will not get what they asked for because of their behaviour third let them know what they need to do or if old enough ask them what they can do next time do not tell them they are bad just their behaviour hope this is helpful  Transactional analysis God Emperor of Dune Social rule Autism Theory of conduct Karen Horney Magical thinking Electrophysiology Human sexual behavior Domestic violence Stuttering Internal ballistics Aikido Anger management Attachment theory Characters in the Smurfs The nature of God in Western theology Dog training Poker jargon Childlove movement Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Classical mechanics Prisoner's dilemma Explosive material Pitaten Narcissism Spanking Child sexuality Kodocha Psychology Anger Current teachings of Prem Rawat Aerial (dance move) Grief Religion Software engineering Justice (TNG episode) Child sexual abuse Ranma __ characters Urinary incontinence Richard Rahl Object-oriented programming Shaggy dog story The Empty Child Sant Thakar Singh Piccolo Junior Saga Hikikomori Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Entropy Neuro-linguistic programming Asperger syndrome Motorcycle Blood (computer game) Fathers' rights Psychosis Conspiracy (TNG episode) Singlish Transsexuality Anorexia nervosa Past teachings of Prem Rawat Ethics Symbiosis (TNG episode) Avenue Q Punk ideology Coming of Age (TNG episode) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Traumatic brain injury Newbie Sexual orientation Beetle in an Anthill Volleyball Reiki Self programming language Fast bowling Extreme Programming Bubble Bobble Human nature Sydney Riot of 1879 Epilepsy Dog Weight training Nicomachean Ethics Ocean's Twelve Second language acquisition Randomness Determinism Altruism False memory Autostereogram Richard Feynman Defence mechanism Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Tag Economics Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Psychotherapy

why does everyone expect me to be over this so soon i am and i had a miscarriage july th i was weeks along with my first child it's been a month and i still cry when i see babies pregnant women and even baby clothing certain songs even make me cry my boyfriend of years the baby's father disengaged from me completly and refused to talk about it saying it hurts too much i understand that it hurts but i feel like we would both be better if we could talk about it he finally came back around but still refuses to talk about it my mom dad as well as alot of other family friends seems to think i should be over this already telling me i need to move on i don't see why they feel like this is something i should be over already of all people i expected my mother to understand my pain as she had miscarriages before she had me i just don't understand how they expect me to be over loosing my first child so soon i mean its only been a month i'm still depressed and can't seem to move on any suggestions for coping please serious answers only if you can't be nice don't answer no the pregnancy was not planned but we were both very happy about it we are both seniors in college and felt we could manage rosesharon having a child with a disability does not ruin your life it only enhances it i am a psychology major and hope to work with autistic disabled children to me it would be a blessing to be given a special child to love protect and care for not a burden i'm so sorry for your loss i understand exactly how you feel i had a miscarriage in may and i felt terrible for a long while some people even had the nerve to ask me only days later if i was going to continue going to school i had just got accepted to a ph d program around the time i found out i was pregnant i had decided not to go to school so that i could take care of my babies yes they were twins i have still decided not to go to school my husband and i moved away and we are looking forward to trying again for our family i've just now started to come around and have made things a lot easier for my husband he was devestated as well but he tried to be the strong one for both of us i was so angry for a while and hated the fact that other women were pregnant or giving birth but i realized i shouldn't be so hateful and should be happy for them its good to write things down and look at the bright side of life you're still young and have years left to have children plus i don't think you can ever get over the loss of a child whether it was a miscarriage or later in life i'm thankful that i had other ladies to talk to who had experienced a miscarriage i'm even more grateful that they came forward and talked to me about their own loss that's really what helped me the most one of my coworkers told me sometimes we go through things in life so that we can help others in need and that's what i'm doing for you now another cowork of mine had a miscarriage about years ago and she said she still puts up a christmas ornament for that baby since he she was to be born around christmas time she said her husband used to get upset about it but its her way of always remembering the child she lost i'm sorry you had to go through this but it will only make you stronger later i know you may not see it now and you may have really rough times up ahead but believe me time does heal i wish you the best of luck and don't ever forget about this baby you lost and don't listen to those who say you should move on with your life bless you sorry if this was too long  Friends Miscarriage EastEnders Pregnancy Kodocha Shaggy dog story Knots Landing Abortion debate Theory of conduct Pitaten Social rule Avenue Q Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Autism About a Boy Jon Secada Hollyoaks Cliff Richard One Tree Hill (TV series) Breastfeeding Leo Wyatt Humphrey Bogart Marilyn Monroe Boston Public Childbirth Neighbours Le Malade imaginaire History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Melanie Wilkes Everwood Kim Possible Clinical depression Days of our Lives The Shining (film) Spina bifida Incarnations of Immortality Stillbirth Harry Potter (character) Eddie Guerrero Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Darth Vader She Loves You Honey and Clover Sami Brady Grief Virgin Mary in Islam Sharon Tate The Amber Spyglass Characters in the Smurfs Anne Boleyn Dinah Marler Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) One Life to Live Grandview, U.S.A.

what are my chances that i might have to adopt this year i had and still do have a kidney problem b c i have sickle cell trait every six months i have to get a check up the doctors said everytime i get sick my kidneys will most likely mess up since i have sickle cell trait i get sick easily my question is what are the chances of me having a child with this new found problem be honest i think my mom is too afraid to tell me that's why i didn't ask her is it better off for me to adopt a child sickle cell trait is a disease that you can inherit it's a blood disorder that produces abnormal sickle moon shaped cells people with sickle cell usually are anemics and iron defiency and get easily sick and it's hard for us to get better kelsey h adopting is not a burden it's just that i always thought that i could have kids and now that might not be possible by the way i am black i need real answers by the way j lynn i know what the symptoms are of sickle cell trait because i do have it well a genetic counselor would probably try to discourage you from having biological children because of the chances of passing on sickle cell to them not that that's stopped anyone in the past adoption is a wonderful option i'm adopted and couldn't be happier look into the adoption laws regulations in your state do a lot of research on whether you want to adopt internationally or domestically and be prepared for a lot of paperwork possible heartache and problems with an adopted child that a bio child might not have such as a feeling of abandonment because their birth mother gave them up it doesn't matter how altruistic the b m's reasons are the child will still feel like they did something wrong  Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Abortion debate Androgen insensitivity syndrome Eugenics Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Adoption Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Cancer Alcoholism Prenatal diagnosis Price equation Biology and sexual orientation Theory of conduct Medicine Lupus erythematosus Cephalic disorder Intelligence quotient Altruism Psoriasis Dog Kidney Anemia Huntington's disease Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Charles Darwin's illness EastEnders Kodocha Anorexia nervosa Diabetes mellitus Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Mitochondrial genetics Species Chronic fatigue syndrome Utilitarianism Coeliac disease Asthma Stem cell DNA Clinical depression Evolution Congenital disorder Equine conformation X chromosome Multiple myeloma Urinary incontinence Asperger syndrome Senescence Obsessive-compulsive disorder Obstetrics Human cloning Stroke Tuberous sclerosis Tuberculosis Human Metastasis Crohn's disease Validity of human races Pitaten Hirschsprung's disease Time Out of Mind Mystique (comics) Insulin Nature versus nurture Leukemia Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Sociobiology Blood Sexual orientation Controversies in autism Health insurance HIV Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Adult attention-deficit disorder Alzheimer's disease Duchenne muscular dystrophy Sant Thakar Singh Childbirth Disease Knots Landing Autism Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Premature birth Red blood cell Organ transplant Domestic violence

is it possible to create a human child from two eggs i was wondering if science has yet found a way to manipulate them somehow so that a baby could be born sharing traits of both eggs no the males sperm must be present to create life baby making basics conception is based on an intricate series of events every month hormones from your pituitary gland stimulate your ovaries to release an egg or ovulate this often happens around day of the menstrual cycle although the exact timing may vary among women or even from month to month once the egg is released it travels to the fallopian tube if you want to conceive now's the time the egg has about hours to unite with a sperm since sperm cells can survive in your reproductive tract for two to three days it's best to have regular sex during the days leading up to ovulation if the egg is fertilized it'll travel to the uterus two to four days later there it'll attach to the uterine lining you're pregnant your periods will stop as your body begins to support the embryo if the egg isn't fertilized it'll break down and you'll have your next period as usual  Ovulation Infertility Ovary Sexual reproduction Fertilisation Female reproductive system (human) Fertility awareness Endometriosis Emergency contraception Polycystic ovary syndrome Oral contraceptive Estrus cycle Intersexuality Ovum Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sexual intercourse Endometrium Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Androgen Twin Uterus Fetal development Miscarriage Ovarian cancer Ectopic pregnancy Flowering plant Testicle Obstetrics Swyer syndrome Sterilization (surgical procedure) Abortion debate Amenorrhoea Meiosis Childbirth Pregnancy (mammals) Man Human cloning Progesterone Gynaecology Sexual differentiation Embryo transfer Gonorrhoea Chakra Growth hormone Endocrinology Semen Parthenogenesis Spermatozoon Pelvic inflammatory disease Endometrial cancer Premature birth Urinary incontinence Vagina Carpel Shark Male reproductive system (human) Tsetse fly Digenea Sex Ovarian cyst Delayed puberty Luteinizing hormone Breastfeeding Pituitary gland Growth hormone deficiency Multiple birth Oxytocin Gonadotropin-releasing hormone Drosophila melanogaster Edward's syndrome Chimera (genetics) Abortion Stem cell Prostate cancer Anatomy Platypus Biology and sexual orientation Jurassic Park Spider Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Endocrine system Estradiol Human sexuality Cryptorchidism Gynecologic hemorrhage Human development Earthworm

abortion why is abortion a woman only question why does the father not have the same legal rights to determine the existence of his child under uk law edit i understand that a woman has to carry and give birth to to the child but why should that be a a reason for a comitted father not to have a say wether the baby is born or not he was at least the reason why the child was conceived and to give a selfish reason if the child is born a father has to pay child support towrads the baby surely in todays society this should amongst other reasons entitle him to a say excellent question unfortunately you make too much sense for many people to comprehend the same ones yelling my body my choice are the same ones who'll go chasing the absent father with the ironic statement it takes two to tango st century society and statements like 'my body my choice' are producing men who are scared to become husbands and fathers instead of making equal rights for men and women the legal system is now at the point where it punishes a man who has children he can't afford but rewards a woman who does the same thing the truth is most men don't want to 'control' a woman's body or her decisions they only want some say when it's a decision that could affect their lives forever which a baby definitely does but if you want of the choice then you should be held accountable for of the responsibility  Abortion debate Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Abortion in the United States Ethics Simone Weil Free will Mary, the mother of Jesus Slander and libel Capital punishment Rick Santorum Goodness and value theory Civil rights Theodicy Marriage Divorce Theory of conduct Roe v.

your oppinion here are two articles about it http www cnn com tech computing armchip idg http www tldm org news markofthebeast htm what are your thoughts on having these chips put into people personaly i think it is discusting and to think the goverment is thinking of making a law where you have to have one they are going to start with puting them in your ids they are also thinking of implanting all new born babies with this chips how do you feel about that i think it is a crock of shi and the founding fathers of our nation would demand an all out revolution just because of the very idea they will surely sell americans on it by first saying the world is not a safe place and they will start with either babies because of course you want to know where your child is at all times fear or they will put them in criminals so we can all rest assured that 'criminals' wont come steal our babies it's a load they are going to target us with fear until we all give in and agree to have them the gov't will probably on purpose mastermind a wave of kidnappings to prove how dangerous the world is and then the media will beef up the rewards of having an implanted chip in your baby the whole thing is a set up it's like putting a barcode on a can of soup apparently all we really are is just food for aliens or some sick sh t like that and for some screwed up reason the powers that be need to tag all of us i think we should tag all of the members of the hidden branches of gov't and track them down and run their id's and finger print them and collect them all together so we will know where they are what they are doing where they shop for groceries what their purchases are what kind of medical problems they have we should take a dna sample from them and insist that they take vaccinations it's a load  RFID Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Surveillance RISC World Wide Web Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Abortion debate 2005 Kashmir earthquake Roswell UFO incident Spyware Ethics Octopus card Trailer Park Boys CPU design HTTP cookie Pregnancy Smallpox Scientology beliefs and practices HyperText Transfer Protocol Characters of Lost Knots Landing Computer virus Autism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hobgoblin (comics) Plame affair Pet skunk Theory of conduct 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban DNA microarray World Championship Wrestling Andr__s Manuel L__pez Obrador The nature of God in Western theology Breastfeeding Biometrics Ultimate Spider-Man Conspiracy theories (a collection) Babylonian law Phishing Mystique (comics) People's Republic of China Dark Phoenix Saga Food Slashdot subculture Super Nintendo Entertainment System Fathers' rights Emperor Yuan of Han The Apprentice 2 The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Insulin Abduction Phenomenon It's Walky!

was your hubby scared to have kids too my hubby and i have been married for year he's and i'm when we got married my hubby told me that after we were in a house for year we would start trying for a baby it'll be a year at the end of august acouple weeks ago i asked him where he was at and he told me he was getting closer and closer to wanting a baby but that he was scared that he'd be a bad father because his parents were horrible and he had such a bad childhood since he didn't really give me an estimated date as to when we would be starting to try i asked him again acouple days ago he said stop asking me i'll let you know when i'm ready the way he said it was rude and now i'm getting pissed off i'm starting to think he doesn't want kids cause he's never been excited about it and keeps avoiding talking about it what do you think i held my end of the bargin i got us a house and we are doing pretty good financially where your husband bf's just as scared i feel like i can't just let it go it's driving me crazy i'm a planner and it's important to me to take my vitamins and continue to eat healthy and exercise before i get pregnant i want to give any possibly te best start and i can't do that unless he gives me a time frame what should i do how can i help him along i understand your frustration i have never met a man that was eager to start a family most men think of children in a different light than us women my husband kept insisting on waiting until we were settled too i now thank him for doing so we were together years before having our baby now months old i am as well and very happy to be a mother but boy is it tough you have to make sure both of you are sure before getting pregnant it is going to change everything about your life it is the most challenging thing my husband and i have done and i am glad that we waited until we were both excited about the idea it would be a much different experience if only one of us was happy about it it is very normal for your husband to be scared about such a big life decision my husband was petrified about the whole thing pregnancy me giving birth dirty diapers the baby crying my husband turned out to be an incredible father but i think that is because we waited until he was ready for the changes that came hang in there give hime another year or so and enjoy your alone time he will come around in his own time believe me this is not a decision that you want to pressure him into my husband and i are already in negotiations about having another baby that is just the way it goes women want babies and men don't necessarily see the rush good luck  Humphrey Bogart EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha Pregnancy Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) The Ashlee Simpson Show Infantilism Breastfeeding The Fairly OddParents Social rule Alois Hitler Jon Secada Kender About a Boy Sharon Tate Jennifer Lopez Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Boston Public Piccolo Junior Saga The Smoking Room Jam (TV series) The Contender (television series) Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Miss Saigon The Empty Child The Star Wars Holiday Special Milton H.

why do so many mothers choose not to brestfeed i am a first time mother to be and was reading a stat that over half of women do no brestfeed do these women pump and feed with a bottle i simply do not understand why such a normal motherly behavior is being denied to their child especially with all the evidence showing all the healthy advantages you will be giving your baby also breast milk is free formula is outrageously expensive i don't understand this behavior at all it's a very personal decision that neither you nor anyone else should question yes we all know breast is best but some mothers for one reason or another cannot or just don't feel comfortable doing it or simply do not want to i btw breastfed my three babies but i would never ever question the decision another mother makes regarding this issue and you say you're a mother to be so you haven't experienced all the situations that breastfeeding presents so you really really have no right to judge you might even change your mind about breastfeeding after giving it a go  Breastfeeding Fertility awareness Childbirth Infant Milk Infantilism International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Breast pump Infant formula Nestl__ boycott Breast Nestl__ Abortion debate Breast milk Androgen insensitivity syndrome Baby bottle Theodicy Empathy Transsexuality Autism The nature of God in Western theology Little Britain Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Brassiere Milton H.

modern parenting a blessing or a curse i'm one of those emotionally sensitive people you know who is always thinking of being fair and understanding of others i've had my moments sure my mom on the other hand is the opposite she hardly ever shows emotion to me and she says whatever pops into her head she's been a good mom but i wouldn't wanna be that kind of mom to my kids she always used that whole i'm the parent your the child thing as a reason for why things had to be she told me i didn't deserve privacy or consideration because i was a child and children don't get those privileges she never gave me second chances if i sassed a bit she immediately punished me and i got grounded for weeks second chances were unheard of now i'm pregnant with my first child and i feel my parenting techniques will be more modern hence the exact opposite of my mom so instead of hitting my kids with a belt cane or anything available i'd rather use the time out strategy what's everyone else's opinion on it i was raised much like you we are raising our children with attachment parenting and it works wonders our son doesn't want to disappoint us and is easy to discipline my parents at first didn't understand it but now because he is nearly say it works attachment parents do not let their kids run the show we use consequences consistency and we are firm yet there is a lot of love touch and hugs in between we have spanked in the past but it didn't work with our son what works better is taking things away as a toddler putting the toy where he could see it but not reach it he is well mannered behaved and a sweet kid our daughter is being raised the same way i recommend the discipline book the baby book and the breastfeeding book all by sears that parenting style doesn't work for all but it does for us  Spanking Abortion debate Theory of conduct Breastfeeding EastEnders Corporal punishment Recurring South Park characters Jon Secada Humphrey Bogart Milton H.

if your child throws up outside a restaurant do you feel that the employees of the restaurant should clean it up or as a parent do you feel it is just another part of being a parent and it's your responsibility to clean up after your own kid i clean up after my child one my son threw up in a store and i cleaned it up he's my responsibility and i don't think it's fair for them to have to clean something that most likely is not part of their job  Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) The Apprentice 2 Transactional analysis Burger King Charmed MC Hammer Wall Street Laura Schlessinger Sweatshop The Human Stain Sento Environmental Protection Agency Benny Morris Diving Adoption Milwaukee, Wisconsin The Jeffersons (South Park) The Critic Friends Social rule Illegitimacy George Costanza The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Fecal incontinence Dancing at Lughnasa Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Baseball Sesame Street Hooper's Store Hell's Kitchen (television) Changeroom Kimberly-Clark Corporation Terrorism against Israel in 2002 The Deep End of the Ocean Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Blooper Beetle in an Anthill Ronald McDonald About a Boy Jam (TV series) J.

can someone help me understand ok i don't understand how if a pregnant women falls on her stomach or has trauma to the stomach she can lose her baby late in pregnancy my friend was telling me of how a woman who was months pregnant and her boyfriend slammed her into the ground she lost her baby but i don't understand how when there is so much protection around the kid such as the amniotic fluid then a kid would come out or die and why would someone want to do that to their baby and girl it is true that the baby in the mothers womb is surrounded by amniotic fluid but just like any other fluid it takes the shape of its container if the mother was slammed to the ground her stomach would receive the impact of hitting the ground and the fluid would flow away from the baby the babies head probably hit the pavement or the head was forced backwards or sideways so hard that its neck was broken i am sure that the mother was hurt as well the babies placenta could have been torn from the mother in which case no oxygen nutrients blood etc would reach the baby as for how anyone could do this to another person i have never understood that on a personal note i had a loved one that was beaten so badly by her husband when she was months pregnant that the baby came out in more than pieces the mother had broken ribs ruptured spleen punctured lungs and many more injuries  Childbirth Abortion Professional wrestling throws EastEnders Miscarriage Professional wrestling holds Pregnancy Fetus Breech birth Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Stroke Equine conformation One Life to Live Suplex Neighbours Abortion debate Pneumonia Cytomegalovirus Lung Kodocha Kurt Angle Drowning Friends In vitro fertilisation Aortic dissection Premature birth Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Jennifer Lopez Boston Public Diving The Shining (film) Reptile Placenta One Tree Hill (TV series) Charmed Sex and the City Twin Rib Intact dilation and extraction Jam (TV series) Stomach cancer Shaggy dog story Professional wrestling aerial techniques Steffi Graf Motorcycle helmet Tammy Wynette Neon Genesis Evangelion glossary First aid Lymphatic system Circulatory system Britney Spears Hollyoaks Amy Dumas Jon Secada Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Coeliac disease Syringomyelia Madonna (entertainer) Snake Eddie Guerrero Eye Comanche Days of our Lives Pregnancy (mammals) Decompression sickness Childfree Birth weight Infant respiratory distress syndrome Stewie Griffin Shock Oral sex Professional wrestling slang Pete Sampras YuYu Hakusho Sami Brady Everwood Endometriosis Glen Jacobs The Amber Spyglass Caesarean section Guinea pig Blood (computer game) Infectious mononucleosis Tupac Shakur Turner syndrome Robin Ventura Mary, the mother of Jesus

abortion is murder therefore it may not be carried out ever and might as well be illegal do you agree somebody i knew from school made that position theirs and made a speech in favour of no abortions at all no i do not agree and do not think abortion should be illegal while i believe there are very few situations that abortion is ok in i still believe it should be the woman's choice i answered a question similar the other day an unwanted and neglected suffering child is very heartbreaking too and that is what a lot of babies would be if abortion was illegal again it would not stop abortion it would just mean people would do it themselves or with the wrong instruments you should watch the original show if these wall could talk with demi moore to see what women use to go through when it was illegal  Abortion Abortion in the United States Roe v.

prenatal paternity testing there are possable fathers of my unborn child my boyfriend of years or his friend that i don't remember even sleeping with either way i was wondering where i could find more information about pre natal paternity testing i dont wanna hear don't do it it could harm the baby because at this point im doing what i can to save the baby concidering my boyfriend wants me to get an abortion right away or he'll leave me the thing is i love him more than anything and i can't picture my life without him this is true love for those that say there are pleanty of fish in the sea if i have the baby and its not his he'll leave me my family will disown me i'll be kicked out on the street while trying to finish school i'll be a single mother with no one to support me because the other possable father said he wants nothing to do with it if i did get an abortion i would be doing the baby a favor or atlease if i get a prenatal paternity test things might turn around also days after this incident with the other guy happend the th i had my period for one day it wasnt heavy tho it was just regular but it only lasted a day could this have been inplantation bleeding or whatever its called and my ultrasound estimated that i concieve on the th but this thing with the other guy happend on the th honestly please put yourself in my shoes before you tell me that what im doing is wrong seriously think about what you would do before telling me that im making a huge mistake there is a prenatal paternity test that poses virtually no risk to you or the baby it is relatively new but the results are just as accurate and they do a traditional cheek swab of the baby after birth to further validate the results you the mother go in and give a sample of your blood at any time after weeks of pregnancy the fathers must also give a dna sample either blood hair follicle or buccal cheek swab the only risk associated with this is the normal risks of having blood drawn the lab then takes the mother's blood sample and isolates fetal cells which have been discarded into her blood stream to create a dna profile for the unborn child and compares it to the dna profiles given by the father s the link to one lab that provides this service is http www dnaplus com fetal cell prenatal paternity test htm they are located in california however they can collect samples anywhere in the country i think there are relatively few labs that offer this service as of yet it is also quite expensive that said i have to give my opinion advice in the sense of your boyfriend saying he will leave you if the baby is not his it may be true love or it might just feel like it right now but how are you going to feel if you abort this baby and in the future you are no longer with him a child's love is true love and that child will be there always there is no guarantee at this point that the boyfriend will be also whether the other possible father wants anything to do with the baby or not he will have to support it financially another option is to place the baby for adoption that would really be doing the baby a favor i really wish you and your baby the best  Pregnancy Obstetrics Abortion debate Miscarriage Abortion Androgen insensitivity syndrome Cytomegalovirus Childbirth Genealogical DNA test Prostate cancer Breastfeeding Abortion in the United States Roe v.

klucky this is sooo anoying how can i make it go away im and in an unsteady relationship and i know bringing a baby into this life would deff not be a good idea with my circumstances but i want one so bad i have an urge to get pregnant i really really want a baby but i no its not a good time for one how can i make my kluckyness go away you can't make it go away it is natural at our age i'm also i have a toddler and i love her very much but i missed out on travel and better education and we did it tough for a while as far as money goes and if your relationship is unsteady now just wait til you have the added pressure of pregnancy and then a child it will only make it worse just think that you have years and years left to have a child wait to be settled and perhaps try focussing on other things like saving for a house and preparing for children instead of jumping into actually having one good luck  The Sims 2 EastEnders Pregnancy Justification (theology) Pitaten Abortion debate Friends One Life to Live Leo Wyatt Sharon Tate Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Piper Halliwell Dancing at Lughnasa Joni Mitchell Poker jargon Adoption Sexual abstinence Charmed Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Jennifer Lopez Great Teacher Onizuka Clint Eastwood Neighbours Phoebe Halliwell Postpartum depression Days of our Lives Breastfeeding Birth control Goodness and value theory Infantilism Abortion Childfree Tony Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Knots Landing Sex and the City One Tree Hill (TV series) Incarnations of Immortality Piccolo Junior Saga Numerology Evil Alois Hitler Our Gang Hiberno-English Prenatal diagnosis Pedophilia Conker's Bad Fur Day Infant Karma Miscarriage History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Something Positive Childbirth Kimberly-Clark Corporation Theory of conduct Publication of Darwin's theory Rugrats Love and Theft Wolfrider The Death Gate Cycle In vitro fertilisation Philip J.

best brand of aio cloth diaper worst brand etc i'm learning up on cloth diapers and am looking for advice on better brands and where to get them cheaper best and worst just depends on the user assuming you know already that cloth diapers bought in department stores are usually worthless everyone has their own opinions though i would definitely advise you to stay away from little lambs if you are looking to cloth diaper a newborn i would hold off on the alos until baby is eating solids regularly you need the cover to hold in all that liquid poo fitteds and prefolds work great as long as you buy a quality brand online and don't worry about prefolds being hard to use they're not you can just fold it into a rectangle and place it into a velcro closing cover no pins needed my favorite aios are bumkins and honeyboys bumkins are very trim dry quick and close with velcro they are a fantastic daytime all in one for nights i'd get honeyboys they are thick and absorbant and will keep baby leak free all night these also close with velcro fuzzi bunz are pocket aios and close with snaps these are good for day and night and are very popular i've heard they are notorious for having their elastic wear out fairly quickly bumgenious are also very popular pocket aios the great thing about these diapers is that they are one size they will last from newborn to potty training all in ones are not cheap you're looking at about for two dozen diapers but they have excellent resale value and believe or not there is a large market for used cloth diapers ebay won't allow used cloth diapers to be sold on there but there are a variety of cloth diaper resale shops and many mothers sell their used diapers on message boards such as diapertraders or diaperswappers and considering you'd spend about on disposable diapers from birth to potty training and that's just for one child cloth diapers can be resued for subsequent children doesn't seem so bad kushie brand aios are the cheapest you'll find they're not bad but they're not great either you can get of them for about some wal marts and babiesrus carry kushies if that cost seems completely unattainable to you prefolds are much cheaper that will run you for dozen cloth diapers and covers if that is still above what you can afford apply to miracle diapers they are a nonprofit organization that provides cloth diapers to low income families http www miraclediapers org on their links page http www miraclediapers org discover html you will find lots of wonderful info to get you started and there are links there to message boards resale shops and affordable new diapers  Kimberly-Clark Corporation Infantilism Comanche Urinary incontinence Mattress Wal-Mart Undergarment USB flash drive Fecal incontinence Strap-on dildo Breastfeeding Bulk vending Dairy Wood carving Price discrimination Billiards Clothing Electronic commerce Warez Elimination communication Advertising Adventures in Odyssey Gaia Online Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Procter & Gamble Bicycle lighting Elastic Plastic Poker jargon Paintball Biodiesel Equine conformation HyperText Transfer Protocol Commodore 64 Microeconomics Jackass: The Movie Nintendo The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Social aspects of clothing Floppy disk Shirt World Wide Web Mozilla Firefox Genericized trademark Ford Motor Company Neopets Hamster Tesco Knife Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Tofu Japanese tea ceremony MAD Magazine Spam (electronic) Internet fraud Jennifer Lopez Kimi Finster Handloading Menstrual cup Condom Wood Arbitrage The Best Page in the Universe Binoculars Gramophone record Plame affair Velcro Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Ramen IBM PC compatible GameFAQs Cytomegalovirus Brewery Tire Climbing equipment Milk Illegal drug trade Animal Crossing Tariff Data mining Mutual fund Amazon.com Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Uniform Resource Locator Nuclear power Internal ballistics Atari 8-bit family Aldi

what is the first step to turning your life around i just had a baby and im a single mom but i really am going through some hard times financially but i just feel like im in a hole im thinking about getting a second job but i know ill miss spending time with my child please give me some advice no smart asses please only serious replies thank you acceptance that to a certain extent we are powerless over some things in our lives inmy opinion only god can help guide us listen to your heart if it sounds like you will miss spending time with your child you probably will regret spending time away and remember that our children are only small for a very short time period don't be afraid to ask for financial help from any source to be able to spend this time with your child we often focus on money in this country when other cultures have two even three generations of family members sharing a house and forget the important things like love and family time and forming true connections and relationships no single mother or single parent should be forced to work two jobs that just is not fair ask god for guidence and help and i know he will show you the way i wish you the best and all of god's blessings  Cliff Richard Charmed Ten Commandments Jon Secada Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Laura Schlessinger Charles Dickens Social rule Empire Burlesque Shaggy dog story Faustyna Kowalska Alcoholics Anonymous John the Baptist EastEnders Infantilism Religious Society of Friends Infant baptism Mother Teresa Recurring South Park characters Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Humphrey Bogart Arjuna Adoption Justification (theology) Time Out of Mind Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Paradox Dead Like Me Reincarnation Rich Mullins Past teachings of Prem Rawat Hollyoaks Ayyavazhi mythology Hey Jude She Loves You Moral Politics Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Sant Mat A Course In Miracles Polyamory Saga (band) Love Meaning of life The Catcher in the Rye Church of Christ, Scientist The Beatles discography Mary, the mother of Jesus W.

if your friend could not have a child would you carry her child for her i truly don't think i could carry a baby then give it to anyone the bond is too strong for me even though it would not be my egg or husband's sperm i would still feel that way i have always admired women who are surrogates what an amazing gift if it was for a good friend who would make a good parent and who i would stay close enough to to continue having a relationship with the child then yes you do bond with the child in your womb but i think i could handle giving it to a good friend and taking the role of special aunt or something as opposed to mother part of this might be the fact that while i love kids i find babies kinda boring still it's a big sacrafice being pregnant is great in some ways but there are alot of not so great parts too i think though that if i was doing it for a friend i would definitely insist on a c section on the other hand i think i'd talk to my friend first about whether or not it was truly important in her situation to have her own biological child there are alot of children needing adoption in the us many of these children have emotional or learning problems because healthy babies are usually snatched up quickly i can see how parents might be daunted by the challenge of adopting a special needs child i grew up with two adopted special needs brothers and it's not an easy thing even if a parent does not wish that children healthy babies are available in large quantities from foreign countries these adoptions cost far more but so does a surrogate pregnancy i would make sure that my friend really really needed to see the baby as a copy of her own genes before i did it still i recognize that for some couples they bond of having a child that is truly half of each is very important and i would be willing to help give this gift  Abortion debate Adoption EastEnders Friends Infantilism Charmed Humphrey Bogart Marriage Days of our Lives Childbirth In vitro fertilisation Pregnancy One Tree Hill (TV series) Laura Schlessinger Infertility Miscarriage About a Boy Polyamory Knots Landing Abortion in the United States Divorce Theory of conduct Surrogacy Everwood Kodocha History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Homosexuality and medical science Melanie Wilkes Mystique (comics) Baby Blues The Critic Jean Grey Boston Public Neighbours Biology and sexual orientation Prostate cancer Jon Secada Family Incest Sex and the City Jam (TV series) Dinah Marler Postpartum depression Love Hina main characters Child sexuality Comanche Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sami Brady W.I.T.C.H.

my boy friend is scared to have this baby he wants me to have an abortion i completely disagree how do i convince him that he will be a good dad how to get rid of his fears he is my life i don't want to lose him he will be there for the baby though he has a wonderful job we have a house and we are financially stable his dad is his hero and he had a wondreful childhood he gives the excuse that he won't be emotionally ready i don't know how old you guys are but i think having a baby is always a scary thing for men especially when it's your first and he is probably thinking about how much his life is going to change and maybe he isn't ready for that yet maybe you just need to give him some time to think it through but don't push him too much my husband boyfriend at the time took a parenting class and that helped him a lot i know he was scared out of his mind to have a baby but he got through it and now he's a wonderful dad and we are having our third maybe he could go to the doctor with you and your doctor could talk with him good luck i hope everything goes ok and congratulations  Friends Jon Secada Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Charmed Kyle Broflovski Coming of Age (TNG episode) Homer Simpson Cliff Richard EastEnders The Ashlee Simpson Show Phoebe Buffay's songs Avenue Q Milton H.

i'm months pregnant and my husband is very unsupportive even insensitive he is going out nearly times a week drinking and partying he comes home at all hours of the night what if i go into labor and he isn't around or he's drunk i try to confront him about it and all he does is get mad and i'm the nagging wife i'm sick of it he doesn't understand how tired i am and how i've been feeling more and more uncomfortable i need help with daily chores and he doesn't do anything it's like his so called friends are more important than me and the baby he really has no clue what awaits him once the baby gets here he says he's just getting all of his partying out now before she gets here but that doesn't make me feel any better i have to go back to work and she's going to stay with him i'm not leaving my baby with a hungover dad worse i want to be the stay at home parent but i can't due to finances i feel like he isn't ready to become a dad he wanted this baby so much and yet even when i told him he didn't really seem that happy i'm so sorry i think that what your husband is experiencing is a major life change that he doesn't know how to deal with so he is going out and acting irresponsibly so he doesn't have to think about it i'd bet he has a lot of apprehension and emotions that he feels like he cant sort out right now i would ask to talk to him and then do it talk dont nag dont yell i think men just tune out when they feel panicked and in trouble talk to him from your heart and tell him your concerns don't say the work you in any accusing way say i'm scared because i'm afraid i will go into labor and i will be home alone i cant sleep when your not home because i worry about you say i worked really hard today and i think i will need more help with things around here say i'm afraid that you won't want this kind of life and i will be alone i think if you speak from your heart you will get a much better response even if you are angry it's okay to be angry just try to separate yourself from it to have a conversation and try to help your family remember also why you decided to marry and make a baby with this person i know you are angry right now but there must be something good about him maybe you can say to him i think you will be a good father because you maybe he is scared and feels like he wont be a good parent maybe he needs the encouragement as much as you do  EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Avenue Q Fiddler on the Roof Grandview, U.S.A.

early signs of autisim does anyone have an autistic child what are the early signs although autism is usually diagnosed when the child is to years old parents often sense that something is wrong much earlier on average parents start to worry about their child's development by months of age and voice some of their concerns to a doctor or another professional by age but physicians and professionals are hesitant to diagnose autism at very early ages they know that the early development of children varies and are often uncertain if a behavior will persist into being considered atypical or if behaviors that should be present will continue to be absent if the child is labeled with a problem too early parents may reduce expectations for the child and restrict the child's access to typical experiences and opportunities thus professionals may take on a wait and see stance that delays diagnosis and ultimately the commencement of intervention services although such concerns are valid the benefits of early diagnosis vastly outweigh the risks these benefits include the relief parents may feel in having their concerns validated and in their ability to address the problem as early as possible as many studies have now shown early intervention is critical for the best outcome in children with autism and many believe the earlier the better only with a diagnosis can parents begin to obtain necessary intervention services for their child given the potential benefits of early diagnosis is it possible to reliably diagnose autism before age the answer is yes a number of researchers have now studied the early development of children with autism a not so easy task given that the average age of diagnosis in the united states is to years of age early development of children with autism has been studied by screening large numbers of children for autism specific behaviors during well baby checks at months of age asking parents of children with autism to remember back to whether their child showed certain behaviors at certain developmental ages and having parents bring in home videos of children diagnosed with autism when these children had their first or second birthday parties which parents often videotape from these studies five distinct areas of development are flagged for consideration all parents should consider these big five if they suspect that their child may have autism does the baby respond to his or her name when called by the caregiver within the first few months of life babies respond to their own name by orienting toward the person who called them typical babies are very responsive to the voices of familiar people and often respond with smiles and looks in contrast infants later diagnosed with autism often fail to respond to their own name that is when called by name they tend to turn and look at the person only about of the time as found in the videotaped one year old birthday parties of children with autism they also are often selectively responsive to sounds they may ignore some sounds and respond to others that are of the same loudness thus they may fail to respond to their parent calling their name but immediately respond to the television being turned on it is not unusual for parents to suspect their child has a hearing loss does the young child engage in joint attention near the end of the first year of life most infants begin to join with their caregivers in looking at the same object or event to aid in this process of joint attention typical infants begin to shift their gaze from toys to people follow other's points monitor the gaze of others point to objects or events to share interest and show toys to others these behaviors have a distinct sharing quality to them for example the young infant may point to an airplane flying over head and look to the parent as if to say do you see that in contrast young children with autism have particular difficulties in jointly attending with others they rarely follow another's points do not often shift their gaze back and forth from objects to people and do not seem to share being with the caregiver as they watch and talk about objects people or events they also tend not to show a toy to the parent does the child imitate others typical infants are mimics very young infants can imitate facial movements e g sticking out their tongue as early as months mothers and infants say the same sounds one after another or clap or make other movements indeed imitation is a major part of such common infant games as pat a cake and so big how big is baby soooo big as infant raises hands to sky young children with autism however less often imitate others they show less imitation of body and facial movements waving making faces playing infant games and less imitation with objects does the child respond emotionally to others typical infants are socially responsive to others they smile when others smile at them and they initiate smiles and laughs when playing with toys and others when typical infants observe another child crying they may cry themselves or looked concerned somewhat older infants may crawl near the person pat or in other ways offer comfort these latter behaviors are suggestive of empathy and are commonly observed among children in the second year of life in contrast children with autism may seem unaware of the emotions of others they may not take notice of the social smiles of others and thus may not look and smile in response to other's smiles they also may ignore the distress of others several researchers have now shown that when an adult feigns pain and distress after hitting herself with a toy or banging her knee young children with autism are less likely to look at the adult or show facial concern does the baby engage in pretend play someone once noted that play is the work of children young children love to pretend to be a mother father or baby to be a firefighter or police officer although children start to play with toys around six months or so play does not take on a pretend quality until the end of the first year their first actions may involve pretending to feed themselves their mother or a doll brush the doll's hair or wipe the doll's nose nearer their second birthday children engage in truly imaginative play as dolls may take on human qualities of talking or engaging in household routines children may pretend that a sponge is a piece of food a block is a hat or a plastic bowl is a swimming pool that contains water in contrast the play of children with autism may be lacking in several ways the young child may not be interested in objects at all paying more attention to the movement of his hands or a piece of string if interested in toys only certain ones may catch his interest and these may be used in a repetitive way that is not consistent with how most children would play with the toy they may be more interested in turning a toy car upside down and spinning the wheels than pushing the car back and forth overall pretend qualities are nearly absent in the play of children with autism under years of age it is important to note that in each of the areas we have flagged we are most concerned with behaviors that are absent or occur at very low rates the absence of certain behaviors may be more difficult to pinpoint than the presence of atypical behaviors but concerns in any of the above areas should prompt a parent to investigate screening their child for autism several screening measures are now available and information from the screener will help to determine if the parent should pursue further evaluations if the parent is convinced their child has autism then they should seek an evaluation with an expert in autism most likely this evaluation will involve an interview with the parents to obtain a complete developmental history of the child and direct observations of the child in different situations  Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Poker jargon Social

ho do i convince my husband that we should have a baby he's and i'm we've dated for five years before getting married and will soon be celebrating our th wedding anniversary he says he wants kids but not yet and he's been saying that since before we got married i've tried calmly talking about it but he just shuts down and says he doesn't want to talk about it it would be wrong for you to force a child on him though while he has every right to refuse i think it is only fair that he give a proper explanation as to why he cannot fulfill your wishes and why he is giving you mixed signals it may be that he is afraid that once there are children he won't be able to have any time for himself or time to be together as a couple that being the case you should reassure him that while children are very important to you your marriage will always have priority perhaps he is feeling insecure about being a good father which is only natural maybe he is afraid of that level of commitment all i can say is that it doesn't take a college degree any father is better than none provided he's not abusive of course if he is not ready now that he's in his 's then waiting a few years isn't going to make much difference you can never really be ready to be a parent sometimes if you think you want something you just have to take the ball and run with it the only antidote here is a little patience i think try not force the issue but at the same time be clear about what your wishes and needs are and do what you can to find out about his good luck w o m b a t  Divorce Friends Marriage Good Times EastEnders Fathers' rights Piccolo Junior Saga Laura Schlessinger Knots Landing Same-sex marriage Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Le Malade imaginaire Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Theory of conduct Human sexual behavior Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Avenue Q Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Critic God Emperor of Dune Phoebe Halliwell Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

mini pill and breastfeeding i had my baby six weeks ago and just got prescribed the mini pill i started my cycle again though i am breastfeeding is it safe to start the mini pill mid period i don't know if i'll even have another one according to the doctor i haven't started the pill yet besides i know some women have a period even while on the mini pill w the mini pill you start it the same way you do regular pills you start taking them the sunday after you start ex you started your period today fri you would start taking them on sunday you start your period next tues aug you wouldnt start taking them until sun aug if you start your period on a sun then you start the pill that same day the mini pill is very sensitive you have to take it everyday at the same time or you can get preg i would still use a condom while using the mini pill it's really pointless to take if you ask me b c instead of there being estrogen and progesterone there is only progesterone the estrogen dries up your milk just remember to take it everyday at the same time if you are unsure if you will have another period or not it is ok to start taking it mid cycle sundays are easiest to start on though since that is when the week starts  Oral contraceptive Emergency contraception Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Breastfeeding Progesterone only pill Birth control Progesterone Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hormone replacement therapy Breast cancer Pregnancy Estrus cycle Urinary incontinence Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Migraine Morning sickness Breast Childbirth Fecal incontinence Prolactinoma Intrauterine device Baldness treatments Psoriasis Vitamin D Endometriosis Depo Provera Nipple Estrogen Embryo transfer Julian day Ovarian cyst Ovulation Prolactin RISC Ectopic pregnancy Antidepressant Hebrew calendar Obstetrics Mammary gland Polycystic ovary syndrome Hyperprolactinaemia Folic acid Hormone Computus Nutrition Alanis Morissette Androgen insensitivity syndrome Full moon cycle Testosterone Puberty HIV Calendar Year Tocopherol Premenstrual stress syndrome National Football League Sleep Androgen Anabolic steroid Menstrual cup Swyer syndrome Sunspot Frankie Laine Osteoporosis Carl Djerassi Neighbours Lactose intolerance Mid-Autumn Festival Dominical letter Sunday Sexual revolution Gregorian calendar Breast milk Sexual abstinence Brassiere BBC Radio 4 Leeds United F.C.

is having a baby a good idea i'm in my mid twenties and have a yr old i still get along good with her father although we are not together he and i have both talked about wanting another child and i feel as though my daughter is growing up fast and i don't want her to be an only child like i was i really would love to have another child but i don't want be with him and he is aware of that i also don't want to be when i go to my kids graduation i just don't know what to do and on top of everything my dad was diagnosed with a degenertaive disorder and has verbalized how much he would love to have more grandchildren i've been single for over years and can't seem to find anyone to even date i can't imagine meeting someone falling in love getting married and having kids within the next year or has anyone been in this situation or have any good advice i'd be thankful for it well you have years before you'd be at your kid's graduation they will already be years apart which is a lot by the time the baby is two or so ready to really play she will be seven and have outside friends from school baby will be more like a toy and the novelty will wear off my own belief is that you should never bring kids into the world without two loving live in parents i know things don't always work out but why start out with the odds against you you don't need the stress of raising another child with your dad not well he may have that wish but it is completely wrong to have a child to please a grandparent trust that the right man is out there for you if you want another child it is good that you are picky you will know good when you see it don't have a child for any reason other than you and a live in partner want one your child deserves it  About a Boy Infantilism Friends Social rule Fathers' rights EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Doug Knots Landing Care Bears The Emancipation of Mimi Hey Jude Kodocha Polyamory The Human Stain The Fairly OddParents Fat Man and Little Boy (Simpsons) One Tree Hill (TV series) Theory of conduct Empire Burlesque Transactional analysis Baby Blues Kelly Clarkson Everwood Rich Mullins Laura Schlessinger Kimi Finster Henry Fonda Cliff Richard American Dad!

abortion murder how can anyone justify ending a life there is no reason to end a life people should use protection if they dont want kids not just kill there babies for there own convinience do u know what a poor baby goes through to be abortred how would you like to have your life taken with no say its disgusting to think sum one could do this to a child if somebody came and punched u in the stomach while pregnant and ur child died you would complain but then people just take there childrens lives every day by aborting thm every has a right to life dont they god should be the only one giving and taking lives if year olds in the rd worlds can look after there whole families can you not take care of a child there is more choices which envolve your child breathing air if you could ask the child in ur stomach what they wud prefer life or death they wud say life so please give them what they deserve life is a gift from god please think about your child b you end its life thankyou i feel that abortion should only be considered when the mother's life is in danger if you are in a relationship or not and you are being intimate with one or more people you need to be responsible to handle the repercussions if you aren't ready to handle a possibly pregnancy don't have sex it's simple if we all went through life getting rid of things that popped up that we didn't expect it would be a pretty pathetic world on the other hand if a woman is raped i believe if it is at all possible and not too detrimental to the woman she should try to carry the child to full term and then give that child up for adoption i know that would take a strong woman but at the same time it is not that baby's fault that it was conceived during a violent attack i just feel as though everyone deserves the chance to live  Abortion debate EastEnders Pregnancy Theory of conduct Abortion in the United States Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Religion and abortion Birth control Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Laura Schlessinger Breastfeeding Rape Miscarriage Anti-abortion movement Marriage Pro-choice Sex and the City Adoption Childbirth Evil Vernon Schillinger One Life to Live Marilyn Monroe Days of our Lives Charmed Teenage pregnancy Prenatal diagnosis Knots Landing Humphrey Bogart Friends Abortion in Canada YuYu Hakusho About a Boy Ayyavazhi mythology Intact dilation and extraction Infantilism Child sexuality Domestic violence Childfree Partial-birth abortion Human sexual behavior Child sexual abuse Polyamory Murder Free will Roe v.

what was your favorite for a project i am working on thanks what was your favorite baby reference source why example babycenter com beacuse of the day by day guide maybe it was a book or a tv show or a favorite person to talk with like your ob or midwife or grandma or aunt maybe even your own mother what is one thing you wish every woman new about pregnancy childbirth and motherhood that you didn't realize until you were pregnant in labor or a mom is there anything you would do differently during a subsiquent pregnancy or birth and what is it moms what useful tips do you have for first time mothers words of encouragement or advice did any of you use a pregnancy journal would you again and what were your likes and dislikes about using a journal thank you to all who take the time to answer all the questions my favorite baby references were www americanbaby com for the month by month guide the book while waiting because it had tips to ease common pregnancy problems and the show a birth story for seeing real life experiences the one thing i wished everyone knew is that no matter how many books you read shows you watch or advice you listen to you'll never be prepared for motherhood and that's ok you just learn your baby is a great teacher also i think mother's should listen and trust their instincts more than trying to do things the way their mother or grandmother did the only thing i would do differently is now i know what baby equipment i really need and what's useless i didn't use a pregnancy journal this was mainly because i was either sick tired or both i doubt i could with future pregnancies either because i will be too busy caring for my toddler  Childbirth Breastfeeding Abortion debate Midwifery Breech birth Friends Elephant Teenage pregnancy EastEnders Knots Landing Socrates Fertility awareness Premature birth The Lovely Bones Kodocha Miscarriage Charmed Twin Postpartum depression Shaggy dog story Baby Blues Humphrey Bogart Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Days of our Lives Folic acid Joke Abortion History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Cytomegalovirus Melanie Wilkes God Emperor of Dune Human sexual behavior Roe v.

do i have say with my child daughter i just got married to my husband after living together for almost a year he has a yr old she lives states away with her mother most the time but we see her at least every month for a week or more during the summers it is a lot more than that i am mths pregnant so she has been coming up to us for weeks at a time her dad feels guilty about not being able to spend as much time with her as he should and i know that but when she comes it completely disrupts our lives because of that she has no bedtime she eats anything that she wants to and pretty much does what she wants too i want her up with us more but i can t help but dreading her stays one of my biggest problems is that my husband falls asleep with her watching tv on the couch every night i complain about it and he just says that he is trying to spend time with his daughter i just want a normal family routine when she is here so that i don t feel like it completely disrupts everything but am i oversteping here first i think you need to have another talk with your husband i'd be concerned since you have a child on the way and it doesn't appear he understands that children need limits order and rules he may say he feels guilty because he doesn't see his daughter enough but that doesn't justify letting her do what she wants you're not going to want your own daughter to model his daughter's behavior so this needs to be addressed sooner rather than later i think you do have a say since it's your house and you should be able to set some rules but i understand the sensitivity as she has her own mother and you don't want to become the evil stepmother think you really need to have your husband do this but if he won't i don't see that you have a choice sorry you're in such a difficult situation good luck  EastEnders Theory of conduct The Catcher in the Rye Social rule Fathers' rights Friends About a Boy Hollyoaks Maison Ikkoku Abortion debate Phoebe Halliwell Sharon Tate Garfield Alignment (role-playing games) Kurt Cobain Days of our Lives Fathers' rights movement in the UK Pitaten Knots Landing The Ashlee Simpson Show Poker jargon Marilyn Monroe Jam (TV series) One Life to Live Stuttering Ben Johnson (athlete) Narcissism 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Kodocha Incarnations of Immortality Madonna (entertainer) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theodicy Big Brother (USA TV series) My Life as a Teenage Robot Characters in the Smurfs Narcolepsy Abortion in the United States Laura Schlessinger Angelina Jolie Domestic violence Henry Fonda Traumatic incident reduction Transactional analysis The Fairly OddParents W.I.T.C.H.

arkansas family has th child what do you think according to news stories they were talking about having more kids within the hour after their th baby was born my goodness personal opinion these people must be crazy what do you think i had no idea id get everyone's undies in a bunch lol reeeelax life is too short guys to get all up in a fuss about nothing if it bugs you that much that i was curious to know what others thought they don't answer these folks have chosen to be on several tv specials and even has a series about their lives call me crazy but it seems it's their intent to have people talk about them they clearly know people who dont share the same lifestyle would find it interesting so i think the reason we've heard so much about them is because they chose to be in the limelight i have two thoughts on this issue i am envious i really want a big family of both my own adopted children and i am having a hard time convincing hubby of it isn't the size of the family that bothers me it is the fact that they are a loving wonderful family that can obviously afford lots of children it would be nice if they were willling to share that with some of the many children without families via fostering or adoption just my cents  Theory of conduct W.

sorry another circumcision question for you that have circumsized your son's i am weeks pregnant with a little boy and plan on doing it i was just wondering is it hard to take care of afterward or is it like the umbilical cord in a way i have a daughter so i know about that do you have to do anything special so that it doesn't stick to the diaper when do they do it i am being very serious i just wanted to hear some experiences i want it done and we are getting it done i'm just having mixed feelings on that hurting him the last thing i want is something to hurt my son right after he's born it's very easy to take care of you really don't have to mess with it much the cap will fall off in a few weeks they do it the same day or the day after your baby is born you might put a little ky jelly on it to help it from sticking to the diaper but only if your doctor tells you to it will hurt him but only for a moment they put your baby in a special chair and strap him down so he doesn't move much then the put a numbing gel on his private so it's not that bad he will cry but after you can pick him up and comfort him he will be fine the whole process takes less than minutes good luck with everything and congrats on the baby boy  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Breastfeeding Frankie Laine Friends Infantilism Jon Secada Pregnancy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Childbirth Blood on the Tracks Urinary incontinence Obstetrics Pitaten Strap-on dildo The Inside Time Out of Mind The Shining (film) Diaper Professional wrestling match types Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Milton H.

do you think this will play into effect with custody if the father is saying the kids not his to begin with do you think tht later on in court that will play into effect that the only time he said it was his is after i have a dna test done and b hand he wants nothing to do with the baby i have emails and text messages and such that show that he does not claim the baby he says that he will take responsibilty but to get custody of the child i think hes trying to scare me into not saying the babies his my sons dad is claiming the same thing telling me that my baby isnt his son i must have slept around and all this crap so i filed for child support requested a dna test upfront that way he'll have the test before we ever go to court i talked to a friend of mine who is a paralegal and she said that none of that really makes much difference in court they look at the bigger things like does either parent have any felonies either parent a drug addict which parent is more financially stable etc in my case the father has only spoken to me once since september when i told him i was pregnant and my friend said that the judge looks at things like that she said that he'll see that the father hasnt been around the entire pregnancy or months of his sons life and that will play a big part in their decisions i dont see where a judge would give a man custody of a child hes never been around i suggest getting a phone book and looking up lawyers call a family law lawyer see if they have free consultations if they do set one up you can sit with a lawyer tell them the situation and they can tell you what they think your not obligated to hire the lawyer after that consultation some states even have legal advice offices where they'll give you free legal advice if you message me i can help you find one of those offices  Divorce Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Appeal Child support 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Plame affair Schapelle Corby Fathers' rights Lawyer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Friends Child custody O.

child custody please advice okay i am pregnant right now and the dad's saying its not his well i told him that rather he beleives it or not its his and i am putting his name on the birth certificate well his response was if i did he would have a dna test done i already planned that and get custody of the baby how likely is it that he can do this if i am not unfit i have a clean house i am currently not working but checking into a work at home thing the reason i am not working is cuz i can't lift what are the chances he will be able to get full custody of the baby i'm not real worried about it but he does have more money than i do highly unlikely parents don't get sole custody without a reason the majority of judges won't go for that in all honesty he's just saying that to scare you out of doing the test if dna tests prove it's his he'll have to pay child support and it sounds like he will do anything possible to keep from having responsibility in this he's not going to go for full custody he doesn't even want to be named the daddy  Child support EastEnders Fathers' rights Friends Father Divorce 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Jon Secada Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prenatal diagnosis The Fairly OddParents Polyamory Ocean's Twelve Infantilism Child custody Charmed Street-Legal Humphrey Bogart Fathers' rights movement in the UK Androgen insensitivity syndrome Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Lord Chancellor Abortion in the United States Characters of Lost History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) Los Rold__n Adoption Status of religious freedom in Malaysia David Blunkett Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Grandview, U.S.A.

why does everyone name their kids the same thing i know people are also obsessed with giving original names if i was going to have a kid i'd check the list of the top baby names of the past year and not use them i've noticed everyone naming their kids grace lilly etc there is going to be classrooms full of kids with the same name like about years ago when there was hunters or when i was kid with jennifers but on the other hand there is some bizzare names people are using now ok the first two answers don't you wonder if the rest of your lives people are going to say your name is marissa and she'll have to be like no or the other one it looks like mila sounds like vanilla except just with a m lacy d exactly what i'm talking about it i can't even say your kids names i hope you know they are going to be coming home in tears while i appreciate the efforts of some parents to create unique and special names for their children i always think back to the first day of school the teacher is trying to take roll call they have to try and pronounce these names that is what is going to happen to their children for the rest of their lives correcting spelling and pronunciation of their names for a lifetime seems sometimes more bothersome than special and unique my kids have somewhat common names on the popularity scale kind of about halfway down the top list  Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Jon Secada Current teachings of Prem Rawat Hangul Episodes of Lost (Season 1) AFI 100 Years series International Phonetic Alphabet That '70s Show Scenes from a Memory Kodocha Teachers (film) Jennifer Lopez Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Hiberno-English The O.C.

preg and neg tests how many people have takin preg test and they turn out neg when they knew they were preg i want to know what tests you used and which ones you would prefer i got pregnant on a thanksgiving weekend a week later i took off from work b c i was nauseated i took a pregnancy test because a friend told me it could be morning sickness i took the test dec negative my period was was due around the th of december i had abnormal periods often so i waited a whole week in case my period decided to show up i was tired of buying pregnancy tests on the third late day taking them on the th day and getting my period on the next day so i took the test dec a week after my missed period it was positive there are new pregnancy tests on the market that can tell you with accuracy on your third day after your period is due when tested in labs that means that if you follow the directions exactly you will be more likely to get an accurate result keep it under the urine stream as long as they say and make sure you don't get the window wet the best way to take a pregnancy test is to urinate into a dixie cup that is clean and then dip the testing part of the stick into the urine for seconds or however long the test directs you to keep it under the stream of urine lay it flat on a clean surface i always used a paper towel and wait the time they say if you check it too soon you may just throw out the test before it can register that you're pregnant i always used clearblue easy it was accurate every time that i took it when my body was producing the pregnancy hormone you don't produce the hormone they are looking for until at least one day after your missed period there are currently no tests available to check right when you conceive that's why when i took the test days before my period was supposed to start it was negative i'm glad i took the test on the nd i was taking meds that could have been dangerous to my baby i called my doctor immediately and she told me how to wean myself off those meds clearblue makes the test that finds pregnancy the soonest after your missed period  Pregnancy Drug test Menstrual cycle Obstetrics Breastfeeding HIV test Pregnancy test Abortion Miscarriage Ben Johnson (athlete) Cytomegalovirus Prenatal diagnosis Coeliac disease In vitro fertilisation Gonorrhoea Diabetes mellitus Social rule Pneumonia Anemia Folic acid Japanese toilet Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Lupus erythematosus Prolactinoma Tour de France GunZ The Duel Casting Turner syndrome Oscilloscope Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Neighbours Polycystic ovary syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Elephant Apollo 8 Breech birth Sharon Tate Human chorionic gonadotropin Soap opera Amiodarone EastEnders Jam (TV series) RISC Marilyn Monroe Falsifiability Morning sickness Childbirth Haloperidol Birth control Endometriosis Urination Chronic fatigue syndrome Medicine Urinalysis Ovarian cancer Insulin STS-62 Diaper The Amazing Race Abortion debate Collision detection Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Thalidomide Sleep apnea English cricket team Menstrual cup Sydney Riot of 1879 Hamster Unemployment Emergency contraception Jon Secada Housebreaking Drowning Acne Sumo Spina bifida Sextant Craps Premature birth Ravi Shastri Niddah Debugging Tire Poker jargon Shaggy dog story Toilet paper Mouse (computing)

i will be flying with my month old daughter soon any advice on safe travel flying i have never flown with a child let alone a baby before i am worried about the germs and her getting sick from being on the flight the flight is hours nothing to worry about most colds spread in the thanksgiivng and christmas travel season make sure you take her car seat with you for the flight and for the car rides once you're where you're going even if you haven't bought a ticket for her chances are huge that you'll find two seats next to each other on the plane so she can be safe in her seat next to you flight attendants are very cooperative about this also make sure you have a bottle with you with juice a bottle with really small holes so the baby can drink on take off and landing to avoid ear pain from the cabin pressure changes if you breast feed then that's fine too but during landing or take off it would put the baby without any restraints so use juice just during landing and take off while baby is strapped in safely good luck it will be easier than you think he she will probablt sleep most of the flight o  Breastfeeding Car safety Decompression sickness Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mohamed Atta al-Sayed Howard Hughes EastEnders Gliding Pan Am Flight 103 Comanche Air New Zealand Ron Weasley Childbirth Baby bottle Humphrey Bogart Baby transport Airport The Catcher in the Rye Public transport United Airlines Flight 93 Cabin pressurization Low-cost carrier Airbus A380 Characters of Lost Premature birth Parachute B-47 Stratojet Champagne (beverage) Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia Fixed-wing aircraft Soft drink Social rule Airbag Airport (film) Lockheed U-2 Elevator Bat Boeing 747 Wheel of Fortune Infant Russian joke Milk Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Indianapolis 500 Saturn V Gaia Online Cruising (maritime) Grumpy's Three Wishes Southwest Airlines Bong Coffee MN Airlines, LLC Paragliding Oplan Bojinka Neighbours Ejector seat USS Wasp (CV-7) Apollo Command/Service Module Air safety Diving regulator TAM Linhas A__reas Concorde Clyde Pangborn Space disaster The Amazing Race Cider STS-61 Urinary incontinence Fecal incontinence D.

for anyone who is or has ever been pregnant as stupid as this sounds i've read that in order to have a female child you must get pregnant by sperm that has been in the cervix for several hours before ovulation and that you will have a boy if you have sex while you're ovulating because the sperm that produces male children swim faster and will fertilize the egg before the female sperm how true is this statement i had sex either right before or while i was ovulating and i would like to think my chances of having a girl are equally as good as my chances of having a boy does anyone know where in their cycle they had sex when they became pregnant did you have are you having a boy or a girl any and all opinions are appreciated thanks that is actually the only gender determining wives tale that has any scientific merit however it is still a wives tale it comes from the fact that male sperm swim faster but die sooner and female sperm swim slower but live longer if you have sex two days before you ovulate this theory says that you will probably have a girl because all the male sperm will have died off and the female sperm though they took a couple of days to get to the egg were able to survive oppositely if you have sex when you ovulate the faster male sperm should be able to beat the slower female sperm to the egg and fertilize it first i believe there have been studies done that show this still will not determine gender any better than chance  Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Sexual reproduction In vitro fertilisation Puberty Fertilisation Birth control Oral contraceptive Ovulation Ovary Sex Abortion debate Intersexuality Old wives' tale Emergency contraception Twin Sex assignment John Money Androgen insensitivity syndrome Gender role Female reproductive system (human) Semen Spider Orgasm Sexual intercourse Miscarriage Homosexuality and medical science Moss History of intersex surgery Woman American lobster Cross-dressing Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Transsexuality Sexual differentiation Ovum Gender identity Niddah Leatherback Sea Turtle Gender Sex-selective abortion and infanticide The Handmaid's Tale Housefly Kakapo Drosophila melanogaster Hermaphrodite Bird Order of succession Alternation of generations Infantilism Sexual selection Biology and sexual orientation Non-human animal sexuality Sexual orientation Marchantiophyta Ploidy Meiosis Flowering plant Estrus cycle Laura Schlessinger Sexual attraction Sex organ Chimera (genetics) X chromosome Flower History of sex Gamete Homosexuality and Christianity Sexual identity Queen bee Conifer cones Pregnancy test Religion and sexuality Speed of light Platypus Pedophilia Octopus Fibonacci number Male reproductive system (human) Multiple birth Jam (TV series) Sexual dimorphism Sex and intelligence Gender-neutral language Earthworm Married... with Children Economic inequality Reparative therapy Sexual abstinence Bisexuality Child sexuality Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Prostate cancer Recumbent bicycle

seeking advice from parents whose little ones share a room when my son now months old sleeps through the night regularly we intend to move his crib from the hallway into his yr old sister's room she is excited about the idea she loves him madly but i'm worried about how to make it work especially with his nap time and the possibility of nighttime playing any advice is appreciated so much thanks we did something similar when my second son was born once he was sleeping through the night we moved him into a bedroom with my older son who was for the naps not sure if your daughter is still napping or not my older son was phasing them out when we moved them in together so i would put the baby down for naps in the bedroom and my older son i'd have lie on my bed for naps or just quiet time bedtime was never an issue i put a small fan in their room for some white noise but honestly they never fooled around and never wake eachother up i guess i was lucky we have since moved and my boys are now and and they elected to continue to share a room in the new house even though we have more than enough bedrooms now my sisters two girls who are months apart have shared a room since they were and they did have a tendency to fool around at bedtime and not go to sleep so she arranged the room so they couldn't really see eachother from their cribs even bought one of those screens to put up as a divider so she did that and would be very firm at bedtime about no talking etc its worked out so far good luck  Sleep Insomnia Shaggy dog story Knots Landing Fancy Crane Siesta Out-of-body experience Co-sleeping Friends Sharon Tate Miss Saigon Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Mattress One Tree Hill (TV series) Cliff Richard Sudden infant death syndrome The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) McMansion Care Bears Narcolepsy Fitz Hugh Ludlow The Young Ones (TV series) Kitchen New Alliance Party Sin City Sleep debt Lisa's First Word Slow Train Coming Avenue Q One Life to Live Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Urinary incontinence Wheel of Fortune Liam Gallagher Heart of Gold (Firefly) Mama's Family Cat Elizabeth Smart kidnapping Jon Secada The Jazz Singer Days of our Lives Child sexuality The Virgin Suicides King Lear Donald Neilson Kurt Cobain Roxette Elvis Presley The Shining (film) The Catcher in the Rye Situation comedy The Adventures of Pete & Pete Humphrey Bogart Phoebe Halliwell The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Kodocha The Star Wars Holiday Special AFI 100 Years series The Fairly OddParents The Marriage of Figaro Little Girl Lost (The Twilight Zone) She Loves You Ty Cobb The X-Files (season 1) Full House W.I.T.C.H.

does medicaid automatically cover pregnancy i've been told that it does but i was also under the impression that it's based on income medicaid is based on income however if you are pregnant and do not have insurance the guidelines are different even if you have never qualified for medicaid because your income is too high if you are pregnant and don't have insurance you will probably qualify the medicaid will cover your pregnancy and through the week checkup the baby will be covered until their st birthday  Pregnancy Health insurance Health care in the United States Publicly funded medicine Miscarriage Medicare (United States) Prenatal diagnosis National Insurance Infertility Unemployment benefit EastEnders Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Obstetrics Friends Everwood Childbirth In vitro fertilisation Medicare Part D Prolactinoma Wal-Mart Life insurance Premature birth Social Security Administration HIPAA Jennifer Lopez Barbara Boxer Abortion debate Ectopic pregnancy Taxation in the United States Spina bifida Medicare (Canada) Knots Landing Seven (film) Neighbours Pregnancy test Turner syndrome Nursing home Midwifery Auto insurance Variable universal life insurance Circumcision advocacy Abortion Marilyn Monroe Claire Littleton Paid Family Leave Guideline (medical) Big Brother UK series 6 Anti-abortion movement My Family (television) Babe Carey Health maintenance organization Folic acid One Life to Live Twin Boston Public Hypertension And Maggie Makes Three Henry Waxman Melanie Wilkes Breastfeeding Pregnancy fetishism Samuel Alito Drawn Together Mike Huckabee Toxoplasmosis The Hand That Rocks the Cradle (film) Social issues in the United States US health reform under FDR Bill Frist Psoriasis Cytomegalovirus Elvis and Me Madonna (entertainer) Charmed Teenage pregnancy Centrelink Social security Health savings account Chemical abortion Menstrual cycle Gonorrhoea Tom Coburn Infant Baby Blues Income tax Amniotic sac 401(k) Bill Bradley Jordan (model) Predatory lending Abortion in the United States Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act John Q Ernie Fletcher Employee Retirement Income Security Act Food Stamp Program Trouble (comic)

my children went on vacation with relatives and now i am not happy the grandmother of my children my mother in law decided it would be nice to take my and year old daughters on vacation to spain for week since my children are very close to their grandparents i said it would be fine i was greatful that it would give me a small break and my children would have some time with their grandmother and great aunt before they left i had a long talk with my mother in law about keeping my children safe i am highly paranoid especially after the whole maddie mccann case in portugal when my children got home after the vacation i ended up finding out that my mother in law left them for awhile in the kid's club at the hotel okay there was a babysitter in charge of them but i still freaked out it is a foreign country i don't know this babysitter i was just not happy when i heard this to make matters worse when my oldest daughter got off the plane she was crying when she saw me continued i thought she was just overwhelmed by the whole situation of the busy airport and seeing us etc after i got her in the car and calmed down i was able to talk to her she told me she was crying because she heard her grandmother say to the great aunt that she was so happy that they were home because she wouldn t be able to deal with another week with the kids this made my daughter feel really bad i told her not to worry about it because her mama couldn t deal with minutes without her now i am starting to question myself maybe it wasn t such a good idea to let my children go on vacation with them i m thinking i should be careful about future plans as obviously my mother in law can t deal with my children long term how would you feel in this situation what would you do thanks aahh i feel bad for your daughter that's the worst feeling to know your child's feelings are hurt i would have mixed emotions i would be happy that my girls got to experience going to spain that doesn't happen every day they are quite fortunate on the other hand i would maybe not let them go anywhere again until i made it clear to my mom in law that they were not to be out of her sight that you feel very strongly about that maybe just let her know that your daughter heard what she said about getting away from the kids let her know that it really upset your daughter if she has any feelings at all than she will feel like crap and should apologize to her i think it's important that she explain herself the more uncomfortable she is the better she should watch what she says i just saw a sign that said 'children are like wet cement whatever lands on them leaves an impression' i think that fits here that sucks that she was so upset it may put a strain on their relationship if your daughter lets it eat at her  EastEnders Pitaten Knots Landing Fancy Crane Kodocha Charmed Friends Avenue Q Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Social rule About a Boy The Ashlee Simpson Show Neighbours Humphrey Bogart The Fairly OddParents Miss Saigon Grandview, U.S.A.

do to medical circumstance my daughter will be an only child i had siblings and so did my husband so im worried about her being all alone if you are an only child please let me know what it is like for you im very concerened about it but we cant afford to adopt it is so expensive i am an only child and i'm now when i was little i played outside with neighborhood kids and i went to day care with lots of other kids because my parents both worked i would also play by myself a lot i had lots of imaginary friends when i was young so be prepared when she starts talking to herself when she's playing alone she's actually talking to imaginary playmates one thing i might add is that i wish now that my parents had encouraged me to be more outgoing and to do things like dance or music the earlier kids start the better and it's another great socializing opportunity for an only child you worry that she will be lonely because you know what it was like to have siblings but think about it she doesn't know the difference if you can have pets where you live maybe consider getting something she can help take care of when she's old enough as long as you love her and set aside time each day to play with her she will be fine my parents and i had a great time together my mom and i would play beauty parlor and my dad i and would play steamroller where i'd lay on the bed and he'd roll back and forth across the bed crushing me but he didn't hurt me because the bed was soft and squishy good luck  The Fairly OddParents About a Boy Kodocha Social rule Pitaten The Critic Shaggy dog story Our Gang Adoption Timmy Turner Family EastEnders The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy College Roomies from Hell!!!

mothers and fathers out there who are looking for a baby sitter what qualities do you look for i am i am honest good with kids have baby sat numerous times before can prepare food and give baths what qualities are you looking for in a baby sitter am i too young one of the questions i always ask is if the babysitter knows cpr and first aid because i would feel better knowing they knew what to do in an emergency besides calling or calling me there are steps that can be taken while waiting for the ambulance to arrive that can save a life you can usually take a cpr class at your local hospital but it is not usually taught for free is not too young to babysit but it helps to get the cpr certification so you are better prepared i also look at the maturity level of the individual and if they are able to pay attention and remember my instructions i look at how their appearance is because if they take care of themselves they will be a good caretaker i also ask if they make good grades in school to make sure they are at least somewhat intelligent enough to know what to do in a crisis i look for someone who is responsible and who will not be on the phone all night or eat all my food or go through my things it is always a plus when the babysitter straightens the house a little before i get there  Cardiopulmonary resuscitation Day care Pitaten Paramedic Emergency medical technician Triage Infantilism American Red Cross First aid Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Emergency Medical Services Emergency telephone number Japanese tea ceremony Ambulance Drowning Everwood Nurse Baby Blues Education in the United States The Fairly OddParents For Better or For Worse Jon Secada Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Myocardial infarction Breastfeeding Commander Keen Community emergency response team Education Trip sitter High school Night (book) National Health Service Generation Y About a Boy Swami Vivekananda The Sims Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Scientology beliefs and practices Education in Germany Kodocha Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Hyperthermia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Little Britain Childbirth British Civil Service Vicky (The Fairly OddParents) United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East Calvin and Hobbes Boston Public Medical emergency EastEnders Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus New Kid on the Block Hikikomori Mina Mongoose Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina The Shining (film) Hurricane Katrina disaster relief Lifeguard The Legend of Zelda series characters Care Bears Education in Hong Kong St. John Ambulance Education in the People's Republic of China Social rule John Howard Yoder Fasting Humphrey Bogart College admissions John Kerr Software engineering Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Adoption Ayyavazhi mythology Intelligent design movement Hogwarts God Ecology Trinity College, Dublin Full Metal Panic?

do a heavy sleeper wake up when their baby cries i was just wondering if any mothers go through this and is it hard to wake up it scares me to the point where i don't think i would be able to be alone at night with my baby no i don't have any kids it just scares me thank you i used to be able to sleep through anything and i really mean anything when i was pregnant especially towards the end i was getting up every hours to go pee when the baby came i was only asleep anyway and able to jump up for the baby right away second of all i had the baby in the bassinet for the first few weeks months and was used to his schedule by the time it came to put him in his room as long as my door is open and his is closed i can hear him anytime of the day or night i swear that the main reason you have to sleep so poorly when you are pregnant is just to get you used to sleeping poorly when you have a new baby  Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pregnancy Urinary incontinence Sleep EastEnders Knots Landing The Amber Spyglass The Shining (film) Jon Secada Daylight saving time Tupac Shakur Narcolepsy Ron and Fez AFI 100 Years series Shaggy dog story Futurama (TV series - season 5) Slow Train Coming Breastfeeding Friends Lisa's First Word Treehouse of Horror XII History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Mattress Insomnia Time Out of Mind The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sami Brady The Contender (television series) Journey (band) Jam (TV series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Catcher in the Rye Sudden infant death syndrome The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Fertility awareness Hansel und Gretel The Marriage of Figaro Co-sleeping Premature birth Passenger car What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

how far should you let racism affect your life my husband i want a large family we want to have kids biologicly adopt i was raised to not see the color of someones skin my husband was raised to actually believe that black people are generaly alright but shouldn't be allowed to mix with white i'm glad to say he doesn't believe in this although thats how his parents are now when i look online at adoptable children the majority of them are black one girl in particular i just fell in love with right away considered adopting her then i realized how his parents would react how where we live theres maybe a black population how other's backwards attitudes might affect not only us but the child now i can handle rascist remarks would be ready to stand up for my child but i worry about the child if it would be a negative affect on her i would love her make a good mother for her but is that enough in todays society everyone says racism's a thing of the past but is it really tell me what your opinion is please read my question thoroughly before answering my husband is not rascist at all he'd make a great father his parents are rascist and live very close to us i don't want them saying anything that might affect the child but i really love her and feel we'd make a good mother daughter match despite color her and i are such a perfect match she is five and sooo pretty she has some emotional problems and i've studied psychology for several years and believe i can help her she's also very close to her brother who she's lived with all her life but recently was taken out of his home because although he did his best he wasn't able to fully provide for her and he gave her up which was hard on both of them and if i adopt her i plan to make sure they stay in touch she also has found a love in swimming which is my favorite hobby as well she loves visiting the beach and my family goes to the beach at least twice a year it just seems so right thank you all for your answers you have a great heart and i think what you want to do is awesome there are so many children out there in need of some affection racism is still out there i think it will never stop just go to other sections on yahoo answers and you will see i went once and never went back what people had to say what just so disturbing this is a hard subject i wish i could tell you how the child would feel she might grow up to let it affect her or she might flip all that around and it will make her stronger i guess it all depends on the people supporting her you sound like a very nice person that would do whatever it takes to make that child feel good about herself you rank high in my book you have a lot to give and want to share it you have a big heart and i think that's all that matters as long as you have your husbands support i don't think anything else should matter i wish you the best of luck with your decision which ever one it turns out to be i know you and your family will succeed at what ever you set your minds too god bless you all  Theory of conduct Transactional analysis One Tree Hill (TV series) Jon Secada Pitaten EastEnders Charmed Infantilism W.I.T.C.H.

do you think employers would wanna employ a weeks pregnant i wouldn't tell anyone but family that i was pregnant until at least you pass the first trimester mark applying for a job i wouldn't tell them i was pregnant if you do tell them they aren't going to say well we aren't looking to hire pregnant people right now it's going to be we found a candidate that is better qualified or we have hired someone for the position when they call you back if they even call you at all you are only six weeks along unless you are having a football team you aren't going to start showing for a while now at least obviously showing it may seem a bit deceptive to not tell a potential employer but if you are telling them chances are you are not going to find a job and since kids are very expensive my bet is that you want a job i would not tell them take the job then you can tell them you are pregnant somewhere in the range of to weeks along in your pregnancy if you aren't showing you could wait even longer the only thing i can think of off the top of my head here is that if you are looking for insurance most places are going to count your pregnancy as a pre exsisting condition and your prenatal care and delivery will not be covered basically if you are going to announce to potential employers that you are pregnant you might as well not even bother looking for a job from the employers prospective you are only going to be around for about seven ish more months and then you will be gone for at least two months if you even return at all it's a loss on their end to go through the entire training process etc in most cases they are going to not hire you  Pregnancy Obstetrics Miscarriage Abortion debate Unemployment Roe v.

why are there so few role models has paris hilton took your place i can't believe i asked users if they were role models and i got only answers i would hope more of us adults would start being role models and not let the people who are negative in the media become the ones our children look up to the most got answers now thanks to all the role models that did answer and if you are someones role model please feel free to tell who looks up to you and what you hope they will gain from you being their role model the truth is everybody is a role model for someone else the problem is that youth nowadays are too impressed by all the glitz a good role model may not be popular with today's youth and therefore not real visible i think the media nowdays does not help either it needs to downplay bad rolemodels and give more attention to the people who make a positive difference in this world  Transactional analysis Object-oriented programming Paris Hilton Internet troll Theory of conduct Extreme Programming MMORPG Social rule Grunge music Philosophy of language Motivation The Mysterious Planet Delta Goodrem Gender role Adolescence Science Opinion poll Economic inequality Microeconomics LiveJournal Inflation Software engineering Celebrity MP3 Hydrogeology Ethics Inheritance (computer science) Transsexuality Utilitarianism Monarchy in Canada Turing machine Second language acquisition Labor theory of value Pornography Neuro-linguistic programming Generation Y The nature of God in Western theology Corporate governance Drama Babylon 5 Autism Literacy Bernard Williams General equilibrium Beetle in an Anthill Voter turnout Internet protocol suite Narcissism Experiential education Belief revision Modem Bayesian inference Swami Vivekananda Photography Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Avenue Q G__del's incompleteness theorem Black Hikikomori X Window System Sola fide Lindsay Lohan Child pornography Labour economics Charter school Logic Thread (computer science) Justification (theology) Fann Wong Political spectrum Reputation management Terrell Owens Phaedo Database Scientology beliefs and practices Canadian federal election, 1993 File sharing Video game controversy Agnosticism Mathematical model American football Sant Thakar Singh Simone Weil FAQ Popular culture studies Astronomical seeing Digital photography Current teachings of Prem Rawat Incarnations of Immortality The Chronicles of Narnia Generation X Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope Whose Line Is It Anyway?

should my daughter who is pregnant continue with her college schedule i've advised her to continue on and not quit facing the difficulties that are ahead of her even though she's going to have it tough for a period of time in the end she'll come out on top but i suggested to take online courses to make it easier on her for when her son arrives would anyone take this approach yes kudos to you for giving her good advice as long as her health permits she should keep taking classes and try to take as many credits before the kid arrives i used to teach when i was in grad school and it was really hard for people to get back in the swing of things if they've been out of school for more than a year or so my advice as a former lecturer would be to stay in school and keep taking classes even if it's just one online class my advice as an economist is to stay in school and keep taking classes since the kid would benefit from the mom's increased income and social status more than it would from spending extra hours a day with her  Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Breastfeeding Education in Japan Daylight saving time Education in the United States Education in Hong Kong Education in Germany Education in Portugal Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME The Adventures of Pete & Pete Avenue Q Kodocha Aerial (dance move) Charmed Capitalism Unemployment Education Alexander Technique Game programming Humphrey Bogart Teachers (film) Community college Recess (TV series) Tag University of Houston College Marriage Juris Doctor Girls Aloud DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Prostate cancer Education in Romania Economics Volleyball Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Saved by the Bell The Amazing Race Alternative medicine Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hearing impairment Economic inequality Grade (education) Secondary education in the United States Progressive tax Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Friends Columbia University Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Gross domestic product Emergency Medical Services Master's degree Franklin D.

how do i go about getting visitation once paternity is established i live in oregon and i had a paternity test done if proven the father i would like to have visitation and or split custody the baby will be two in february i haven't been able to see the child and i was just notified of this august of and i am just worried that i may not get visitation rights does anyone know if i will be able to get visitation rights even though i haven't been in the childs life due to me not even knowing about the child until last year and if so where should i start get a family attorney if you are proven to be the father have him file paperwork for which ever you are wanting to go with if you live close to the child then split custody might work but if you are far away then i wouldn't recommend it to hard on parents and the child once the paperwork is filed the mother would be notified of your request and have time to get a lawyer you will get a courtdate to appear to state what you want and why even though childsupport and visitation is suppose to be seperate they do usually ask if you are paying support at the court date if the child is yours then yes with a good lawyer you have a pretty good chance of seeing your child atleast every other weekend and probably day during the week every week typical visitation agreement as long as you don't have a history of violence that may cause harm to the child they may start with supervised visits for a few visits to see how the child responds and let the child get to know you before getting regular visits getting split custody is a little more difficult when a child doesn't know you but if it wasn't your fault you weren't in your childs life then visits should be granted talk to the lawyer asap and get things started if the test comes back you want to move fast if you find out the child is yours because the longer you wait to move on it the worse it will look on you if the child is yours  Divorce Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Fathers' rights Child support 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Visitation Marriage Kodocha EastEnders Friends Humphrey Bogart James Bulger Theory of conduct Mach kernel Abortion in the United States Fathers' rights movement in the UK Hillary Rodham Clinton One Tree Hill (TV series) Supreme Court of the United States Vivian Solon Good Times Patent Killian documents Abortion debate Major League Baseball television contracts Street-Legal Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Piccolo Junior Saga Shaggy dog story Ben Johnson (athlete) Tennessee State Constitution The Ashlee Simpson Show Maria Hertogh riots Knots Landing Continuation War Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Carl Barks Pitaten Paternity Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Branch Davidian Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Wal-Mart Prostate cancer Domestic violence The Contender (television series) Breastfeeding Time Out of Mind Guantanamo Bay No-fault divorce Ocean's Twelve Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Timeline of the Enron scandal Mary Astor Cyprus dispute Father Karl Rove Downing Street memo Attorney at Law Darryl Strawberry Days of our Lives Incarnations of Immortality Password Extreme Programming Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda Probation officer John Roberts Supreme Court nomination and hearings Social rule George W.

okay everyone i really want a baby okay so heres the deal i am married with children already i have a wonderful husband and two of the best kids in the world i am absolutely in all ways a lucky woman i want to have another child and i know that it makes my husband so excited to think about it the thing is we really don't have the money i feel as though that don't matter in ways though if we all waited until we were financially stable we wouldn't have babies right well my children are and and i don't want them to be spread apart much further than that i want them to grow up together and not have one be alot older than the other what do you think we should do try or not am i being greedy with wanting another child to love i absolutely love being a mommy advice please no that financial stability part may not be true to everyone and i don know what it is like to grow up with children that are not your age my brothers are and years older than me and my sisters are and years younger i understand this stuff that is why i want what i want i don't just decide okay thats how they should be raised everything i have said is because of everything i have been through and the who financial stuff great you know if you were born into a rich family lucky you some people work hard for what they have and what they try to provide for there children not all people are that lucky and i don't even consider it luck i for one would not want to be a paris hilton or whoever i am proud to say that i am a working mom and i come from a hardworking family thats my comments on yours i would like to add a thank you to all of you who have answered and put some thought into it i really appreciate it it really is so hard to decide knowing what we want but also trying to know what would be best for my family thank you for the advice on everything i have one boy and one girl see i am lucky i do not have baby clothes because my husband and i made a big move and i got rid of that stuff however i have plenty of neices and nephews and friends who have children and baby stuff it sounds to me like you're just looking for people to agree with a decision you've already made it sounds like what both you and your husband want is to have another child and there's nothing wrong with that i suggest you sit down together and figure out what this child will cost what you'll need and what you can live without to make it happen will you breastfeed it's cheaper than bottle feeding do you have people who will lend give you the essentials crib stroller etc etc do you get a mat leave at all how far will this put you in the hole if anything there's a saying that goes you only regret the things you don't do in life not the things you do if you truly want a third child and can provide it with the necessities of life shelter food clothing and a whole lot of love then do it you won't regret having a third child but you just might regret not having one and lastly remember that your life will change adding another child into the mix as long as you're prepared for that and willing to accept it then you're on the right track good luck  Cliff Richard Time Out of Mind Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct EastEnders AFI 100 Years series Infantilism Kimi Finster Knots Landing Social rule Married... with Children Rich Mullins Empire Burlesque Blood on the Tracks Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Little Britain Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) Piccolo Junior Saga The Adventures of Pete & Pete Frankie Laine Breastfeeding Doug The McGuire Sisters Charmed The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Laura Schlessinger The Lovely Bones Characters in the Smurfs The Catcher in the Rye Rais massacre Scrooge McDuck Zhao Yun Luck About a Boy God Emperor of Dune Big Brother UK series 6 Pitaten Days of our Lives Microeconomics Great Teacher Onizuka The nature of God in Western theology Rugrats Fiddler on the Roof Year of the Spider The Emancipation of Mimi Satchel Paige The Chemical Brothers Neighbours W.

why do people who can't afford one child decide to more than one also do some women have children just because they are bored and need a hobby what about when it gets to the awkward age then what baby's get adopted right away but not older children it seems like people want the early years but not other ones remember baby chicks are cute too but after a while not so cute and you think this is just a poor persons plight how many rich people have children who run amok in their teens and early 's plenty yes babies are cute but any woman who has had one knows they are a lot of work and responsibility if you can't take on the responsibility then you shouldn't have any children i'm not talking about people who work here parents have worked and raised kids for hundreds of years i'm talking about the ones who have kids then pawn them off to boarding schools or nannies or just don't take the time to spend time with them if you have a child it should be because you want to have one not for monitary gain and not just because you are a teenage girl who wants to have sex so badly that you forget about things like birth control and condoms emotionally a teenager is no more ready to be a mother then she is to be an executive at microsoft lately i've seen a horrible trend in families even the best of families the kids are lugged to soccer baseball karate dance gymnastics and dropped off by parents who probably don't even know the name of their kids coaches you hand these kids over to strangers every single day when all they really need is a bit of time with you look at kids like brittany spears and linsey lohan and paris hilton all overly priviledged kids at the moment some born into it some it was thrust upon them at an early age but they are too young to deal with the responsibility of it all and their lives are a mess that is the same thing that happens to people who have children when they aren't ready to have them kids don't come with instruction manuals but if they did the first sentence in that manual would be spend time with your children play with them participate with them be there for them work can wait your boss can wait your children should be your biggest priority right up there next to your spouse you work your butts off supposedly for your kids but when it's all said and done you hardly even know your kids and that is one of the biggest reasons kids are having kids they are searching for someone to love them someone they can love and they think a baby of their own who they would not treat like their parents treated them is the ticket i truly believe there would be a lot fewer teenage girls getting pregnant if their parents took the time to know them don't just drop them off go watch go cheer them on go be there for them the reward you get later will be well worth the effort  EastEnders Friends Social rule Britney Spears Adolescence Abortion debate Kodocha About a Boy Marriage Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Infantilism One Tree Hill (TV series) The Fairly OddParents Little Britain Spice Girls Sex and the City W.I.T.C.H.

when you are pregnant why do we get 'morning sickness' like the causes of it etc thanks xx caused by a hormone called human chorionic gonadotrophin which is produced by the developing embryo there are many theories why this makes you sick however it does cause fluctuations in blood sugar levels which is probably why you feel sick eating or drinking something with lots of sugar such as fruit juice or barley sugars often takes the nausea away as the sugar gives your blood sugar an immediate boost but this must be followed up by some slower acting form of energy such as whole grains including wholemeal granary breads pasta rice etc otherwise your blood sugar will plummet and you will feel sick again  Human chorionic gonadotropin Morning sickness Hypoglycemia Bread Obstetrics Breakfast Pregnancy Alcoholic beverage Low-carbohydrate diet Nutrition Flour German cuisine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Veganism Cereal Androgen Sugar Folic acid Menstrual cycle Aspartame Blood sugar Porridge Cuisine of Singapore Cuisine of Denmark In vitro fertilisation Hyperglycemia Foodborne illness Starch Diarrhea Tooth Vinegar Rice pudding Food guide pyramid Soup Coeliac disease Rum Mammalian embryogenesis Passover Auxin Vitamin C Vomiting Flowering plant Biochemistry Kosher foods Pasta Stomach cancer Oral contraceptive Breastfeeding Animal Coffee Vegetarianism Japanese cuisine Fecal incontinence Cider Sugarcane Alcohol fuel Sugar substitute Hormone Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma First aid Cajun cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Electrolyte Peruvian cuisine Growth hormone Soft drink Diabetes mellitus Atkins Nutritional Approach Food preservation Serbian cuisine Milk Wine Adjustable gastric band Vampire Cuisine of Brazil Commodity markets Fasting Sweetcorn Sake Crohn's disease Cuisine of Argentina Vegetarian cuisine Malaria Polycystic ovary syndrome Moonshine Jewish cuisine Cocaine Insulin Dieting Endocrine system Cuisine of Malaysia Brewing Glycemic index Apple pie Single malt Scotch Sleep Birth control Acromegaly

women only the right time to conceive hi i always thought id be a person who got accidently pregnant or only had to try once i decided i would start trying months ago and had my implant taken out straight away but still nothing i get my period every twenty eight days like clock work each cycle i make sure we try on day and of my cycle and still nothing anyone whose conceived successfully what is your advice my colleages etc just tell me to stop thinking about it but i cant thanks for help yup you do just have to stop thinking about soo hard to do i know but if you can just let nature take its course it will happen soon enough if your periods have always been like clockwork it should be easier but not always how long have you been trying for there is truly only a chance of successful fertilization of the egg each time you try so don't despair we tend to get obsessed with the idea and goal its like we think something is wrong if it doesn't work right off the bat with your implant and with any contraception it sometimes takes a while for your body to regulate its own cycles although you maybe bang on date wise you may not even be ovulating i know it sounds weird but its possible does your partner smoke or eat badly that can sometimes affect motility of his little guys get him to stop those things and focus on being healthy if he's not are you underweight by chance sometimes that can also cause some difficulty they say after one year you should be pregnant but if you're really concerned i'd go see your doctor just to reassure you they will usually tell you to go away until then but if you are insistent they might check you both out in advance bottom line i believe babies pick their parents so your baby just isn't ready yet good luck and try focusing on a hobby or just spending time with your partner or husband instead of making it just about conception make sure you're on a prental or at least taking folic acid daily stay away from coffee and all that other stuff and you'll be on your way  Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Friends Birth control Folic acid Oral contraceptive Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Abortion debate Infertility EastEnders Alcoholics Anonymous Social rule Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ovulation Infantilism Breastfeeding Theory of conduct Emergency contraception Human cloning Prostate cancer Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Extreme Programming Charmed Spina bifida Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fertilisation Sexual abstinence The Death Gate Cycle Series finale Stomach cancer Phoebe Halliwell Guinea pig Traumatic incident reduction Bipolar disorder Miscarriage Neighbours The Smoking Room Vampire Aerial (dance move) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hey Jude AFI 100 Years series Condom Stem cell Obesity Teenage pregnancy Abortion Shaggy dog story Sex and the City Hearing impairment Sharon Tate Blood (computer game) Maya calendar Time Out of Mind Singlish History of sex Divorce StarCraft: Uprising Jam (TV series) Piccolo Junior Saga Kim Possible 2004 Republican National Convention Niddah David Hume Days of our Lives Stuttering The Catcher in the Rye "Weird Al" Yankovic Survivor (novel) One Tree Hill (TV series) Little Britain Prolactinoma Scientology beliefs and practices The Dalek Invasion of Earth 2000 Australian Grand Prix Jon Secada Multiple birth Marriage K' Transactional analysis Characters of The Sandman The Amazing Race Magical thinking Healthy eating Characters in the Smurfs Futurama (TV series - season 3) Malaria Milton H.

my girlfriend is pregnant we have been together for months i'm and she is i'm figuring out how to deal with this scenario i know i will be a great dad my question is if the time is now luckily we have support frm our families i'm afraid this will make us separate because i don't feel it's my time for having a baby congratulations edu i imagine a lot of men feel this way even if they had planned to have a family since they have no control short of preventing it of the whole process of conception and pregnancy it all happens in your woman's body according to her body's unconscious rhythm but don't worry just like falling in love having a child is all about letting go of control you're mature your career is established or at least on its way and you're not on your own a miracle has happened to you and your life is changing just like a butterfly growing out its chrysalis you and your girl are changing growing and developing and you need to go with the flow pick out names wite a journal take photos dream imagine and wonder parenthood is not something you do like all the other strivings in your life it's something that happens to you and later there will be many many opportunities for you to play a very active role in your child's life  Cliff Richard Pregnancy Jon Secada Abortion debate Menstrual cycle Transsexuality Incarnations of Immortality Child sexuality Birth control Breastfeeding Carl Jung Sharon Tate Knots Landing Milton H.
