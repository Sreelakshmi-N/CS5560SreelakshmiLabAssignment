i am planning on buying a new wakeboard and i cant decide the two boards that i cant decide between are the liquid force fish and the liquid force team i have been wake boarding for a while now and need to upgrade my board both boards came from the same basic design of the classic trip series the fish is a shorter wider version and the team is a slightly wider version with more rocker and more aggressive cupped fins so with that being said the fish is shorter and should be ridden cm shorter then your standard board i e a fish since the board is so much shorter it spins quickly in the air and is easier to throw around on the surface it holds an edge awesome but the initial turn to edge takes a few runs to get used too it has a more strait up pop to it and has really soft landings because of the bottom contours which make it easier on the knees the team is a classic continuous rocker board it is built to edge hard and hit the wake fast it's pop is more of a out into the flats kind of pop it tracks extremly well the team is a board that any one from a beginner to an export can get on and be very consistent on wake to wake jumps overall i'd say if you want to ride something different then most boards get the fish it's a really fun shape if you want to get aboard that will help you dial in those tricks then i'd go with the team  Skateboarding trick Kitesurfing Anchor Wakeboarding Professional wrestling throws Fast bowling Volleyball Snowboard Windsurfing Mattress Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Drill bit Aerial (dance move) Equine conformation Professional wrestling attacks Figure skating Rock (music) Ski F-104 Starfighter Violin Tire Snowboarding Motorcycle Poker jargon Bubble Bobble Bodyboarding Craps Powerbomb Saturn V Ultimate (sport) Amateur telescope making Skateboard AIM-9 Sidewinder Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Diving Wheel of Fortune New York City Subway 1957 World Series Strap-on dildo Softball Batting (cricket) Mountain bike Pump It Up Double bass Mars Exploration Rover Table tennis Surfing Frogman Super Mario Bros.
