how does 'bluetooth' work on mobiles i have it on my phone and have no idea what it does and when i would use it hi there bluetooth is used in a number of ways the st way is to purchase a bluetooth headset and use that to make phone calls you can program your phone to be voice activated so you can say a person's name into the headset and it'll dial the relevant number the nd way is to buy a bluetooth dongle and connect it to your computer you can pair this dongle to your phone and computer to allow you to copy music pics etc from your computer to your phone or vice versa the rd way is in my opinion the most useful you can use bluetooth to transfer things such as music tracks ringtones pics contacts etc between phones this means that if your friends or relatives have any music etc that you like on their bluetooth phones they can send them to you equally you can send things to them the same way if you want any further information on how to operate this stuff please let me know and i'll try to help you  Bluetooth GSM services Mobile phone Musical Instrument Digital Interface BlackBerry Dongle Modem Skype Telephone Verizon Wireless Symbian OS Network Switching Subsystem Telephone tapping Copy protection Headphones Voice over IP Telephone number Killer application Linux UK telephone numbering plan Morse Code Telephone numbering plan MSN Messenger Emergency telephone number Gmail Surveillance Dual-tone multi-frequency Call centre Personal digital assistant Q-Telecom Digital camera Universal Serial Bus Computer FidoNet Data retention Phone sex Gizmondo Malware Digital rights management Caller ID Computer network HomePNA IPAQ Internet fraud Customer relationship management Cellular network Nokia N-Gage ITunes Nokia 6620 Argentine telephone numbering plan Tungsten Handheld Harold I of Denmark Global System for Mobile Communications Apple Newton Information Age Cordless telephone Television Phreaking Telephone call Short message service Wi-Fi Toll-free telephone number Copyright infringement of software Secure Digital card Hearing aid Multiplayer Predictive dialer Security token Call for help Computer telephony integration Blue box Plame affair Port (computing) Password Nintendo Revolution Pocket PC Personal area network 9-1-1 Objective-C Cubase North American Numbering Plan AT&T Private branch exchange IP Multimedia Subsystem ITunes Music Store Single (music) Mobile game IBM PC compatible Windows Mobile Digital photography Mouse (computing) Over-the-air programming Bluejacking Contemporary culture of South Korea Karaoke Dial M for Murder

downloading music onto mobile from pc i recently bought a nokia which comes with a memory card onto which you should be able to save music i have music on my pc that i can play on media player or itunes but it doesn't save onto the memory card although the computer does read the card i get an error message i don't have a usb for it since nokia doesn't come with one do you think it would work better with that the same songs were copied to my mp without any problems please help i think the error msg was something like 'the file is disk protected' or something like that it was a week or two ago so i'm not entirely sure also i tried saving by inserting the memory card that comes inside the phone into it's adaptor and then inserting that into my laptop the comp recognised it since the device was visible on 'my computer' but nothing would get saved so basically i would need a usb cable u think rather than the memory card if the song is in mp format it should be fine it will not work if you are trying to take a song you purchased from itunes that requires the phone to be itunes capable which your phone is not you didn't say what the error message was or how you are trying to transfer the music you said you did not have the cable when you have a cable it is very simple the computer reads the phone as a mass storage device and you just drag the music you want to copy from the pc to the device  IPod Floppy disk Universal Serial Bus Bluetooth USB flash drive Musical Instrument Digital Interface Hard disk PlayStation Portable ITunes Music Store Digital rights management Digital photography Digital audio player Computer bus USB mass storage device class PlayStation 2 Flash memory Memory Stick Windows XP Walkman PlayStation 3 Computer virus Apple Computer N-Gage Windows 2000 Commodore 64 ZX Spectrum Compact disc Symbian OS Windows Vista Computer Mobile phone System/36 Computer forensics AmigaOS Advanced Audio Coding Computer hardware Apple Macintosh Memory card MiniDisc SCSI Read-only memory Atari ST FairPlay IPod shuffle Digital camera Television File Allocation Table Dongle Digital video recorder Copy protection Apple II family System/34 Sound recording Nokia Online music store Personal computer Linux Video game music IMac Podcasting Creative Zen Modem Laptop Opera (web browser) FireWire Gramophone record Windows Mobile We Belong Together Virtual memory E-mail Karaoke Punch card RS-232 History of Microsoft Windows Mouse (computing) BlackBerry Xbox IBM PC History of computing hardware Linux kernel Booting Password Commodore International Computer storage C programming language Tungsten Handheld

is there any way to get of a mobile phone contract without the penalties or am i stuck yeah unfortunately you are stuck with the contract the only way to get out of it is if you moved to a new area and there is no signal or service provided by your carrier or if you die and telling them that you lost your phone or that it broke will not get you out of the contract either if you can no longer afford your line then you can try to ask someone else to take it over for you and transfer the contract to them if you just want to leave the carrier and go to another one then you will still have to pay the fee if you want a new phone and can t because you are still under contract you can always add a line to your account but that would mean a new contract you are normally put under a contract because the wireless company subsidies the price of the phone the retail price of the phone might be but because you are a new customer or you upgraded you got to buy the phone for or depending on your wireless company the early termination fee could be anywhere between sorry  Verizon Wireless Telephone North American Numbering Plan Voice over IP Virgin Mobile Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Global System for Mobile Communications Cable television T-Mobile Telephone numbering plan Modem NorthwesTel Vodafone Eircom AT&T Insurance Sprint Nextel Corporation Telephone exchange Wireless Application Protocol Cingular Wireless N-Gage Q-Telecom BlackBerry Cellular network United States Postal Service Rogers Communications Ryanair TiVo MTR General Packet Radio Service Telstra Microeconomics Public transport Verizon Communications Enhanced 911 Wi-Fi EFTPOS Stock Toll-free telephone number WiMAX Telecom New Zealand Private branch exchange Octopus card Leasing Universal Serial Bus ITunes Music Store UK telephone numbering plan Wireless network Filling station NEC Corporation Electronic commerce Airline Radio IP Multimedia Subsystem Denis Law Integrated Services Digital Network Bluetooth Mobile phone Best Buy Vertical service code Telegraphy ALLTEL Wal-Mart NTT DoCoMo Annuity Phreaking Local exchange carrier GSM services Turkcell SBC Communications United Airlines Telephone company Telephone tapping Internet Value added tax 9-1-1 Internet fraud Gmail Videotex Nortel Networks United Parcel Service Qwest Health insurance Advance fee fraud IEEE 802.11 IiNet IPAQ Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Opera (web browser) Outsourcing Network Switching Subsystem BT Group plc Euro ITV Code division multiple access

iphone how long do you think it will take for the iphone to be or less and have no bugs and sold without a contract the iphone is not likely to be reduced in price for the next months the iphone is an amazing phone well worth the purchase i have been using the iphone since june th and just can't get enough of it i recall saying that if the iphone was half as good as the ads show it to be it would be incredible i am happy to report that the iphone is as good if not better than what was shown in ads almost every day i find something new i can do with it or a new feature while there are some shortcomings no device would ever be perfect the iphone is truly an amazing device and i think that just about anyone would love it pros compact revolutionary and easy touch screen interface easy to use quick access to every feature beautiful screen easy to read even in direct sunlight cool and intuitive graphical user interface gui ipod video ipod web browsing e mail and phone all in one easy e mail access from multiple accounts you can get e mails from yahoo gmail and many other accounts allows viewing of various attachments e g pdf google maps and driving directions make finding places and adding to your contact list a snap great widely used applications stocks weather maps youtube ipod etc built in wifi zoomzoomzoom fast fast fast features can be updated via a simple sync feels solid metal like scratch resistent screen although i would recommend getting a screen protector fairly good phone quality cons gb or gb may be too small storage capacity for those people who want to carry all of their music and some videos with them although psychologically either capacity sounds too low in reality even the gb version would be more than enough for those folks wanting only a segment of their song listings over songs if you max out the gb or put a couple of full version movies and about or so songs or any number of combination may be just enough for many if not most users no physical keyboard the keyboard is accessed on the screen and would take a few days to get adjusted to can't attach files in e mail although you can forward attachment you receive on the iphone via e mail can't save images that were sent via e mail can't open certain attachements e g ms office etc can't change position of icons and info stocks weather this will most likely be changed via software update from apple can't change ring profiles on the fly this will most likely be changed via software update from apple no drag and drop capability can't download pics to use as wallpaper unless its from the camera email doesn't switch layout from horizontal to vertical like the safari web browser does this will most likely be changed via software update from apple no back button have to always press the home button for the main menu can't download additional ringtones this will most likely be changed via software update from apple third party apps can only be accessed via the safari web browser this can also be a good thing as it protects the phone from issues relating to installing applications on a device no sd card expansion slot you have to sync to get music videos podcasts uses the slower edge network instead of g network this can also be a plus as g would suck battery life camera does not take videos no flash screen smudges easily i highly recommend getting a screen protector no adobe's flash support this will most likely be changed via software update from apple battery is not user replaceable and would cost to send to apple for replacement can't use bluetooth stereo headphones this will most likely be changed via software update from apple if you use your computer mostly for e mail and some web browsing and are looking for an amazing phone that will allow you receive send e mail browse the web and have the best of ipod and video ipod then the iphone is for you although it is costly for the gb version and for the gb version the phone offers the best of all worlds when it comes to multi functional mobile device although there is a rumour of a smaller nano like version of iphone with less functionality as the original iphone coming out later this year in the u s a new version of the full featured iphone are unlikely to be released in the u s market until mid the european version of the iphone offered for the g network much faster than the at t's edge network is slated to be released by the end of the year  SAS System Enterprise content management Java programming language Webmail ZX Spectrum Nintendo Entertainment System Scalable Vector Graphics Comparison of web browsers Microsoft Office PC Engine Gramophone record Python programming language Cascading Style Sheets PowerBook DVD Password

deleting data on mobile factory reset etc how can i delete the data on my phone and do a factory reset without really being able to access it i'm going to send it off to www mopay co uk and they prefer it if personal information is gone and it is restored to the factory settings problem is the sim cards blocked so i cant access the phone how can i restore it without access and without breaking it or damaging it at all cheers many phones do not allow you to access the phone content without a sim card inserted hence your first option is to get another sim card then use that to switch the phone on and resent the phone also check the manual as a few phones allow you to hard reset the phone in other ways just as a side point most phones use flash memory which even a full master reset on the phone does not leave your data as deleted it can still be recovered with specialist software in some cases my advice would be that if it's just a few personal photos and other basic stuff why bother as nothing untoward can be done with it by others accessing the data if it's got business or confidential data which you really want to protect don't send it to any third party firm as they'll no doubt be refurbishing it and reselling it abroad for profit and they are unlikely to do anything to clear the memory  Bluetooth Windows 2000 The Sims 2 Telephone tapping Secure Digital card Embedded system Network Switching Subsystem GSM services Flash memory IPod Redundant array of independent disks Password Danger Hiptop Enterprise content management Data retention Skype Linked list Global System for Mobile Communications Identity theft Computer virus Read-only memory File system Floppy disk CPU cache Gmail Hard disk British national identity card Pirate decryption Java programming language Virtual memory Digital photography Commodore 64 Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Mobile phone Data remanence Smart card EIA-708 Malware Telephone numbering plan Universal Serial Bus Hayes command set HTML element Trusted computing Classified information Windows XP Modchip Opera (web browser) Buffer overflow E-mail spam Virgin Mobile Diablo II: Lord of Destruction MDAC Plame affair Computer Spam (electronic) Wireless Application Protocol Verizon Wireless Hash table System/36 Computer security Expert system Wi-Fi Federal Standard 1037C Internet fraud Compiler optimization 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Customer relationship management Tungsten Handheld Atari 8-bit family Apollo Guidance Computer Neopets Linux ALGOL 68 X86 assembly language JavaScript Oscilloscope System/34 PDP-11 File Allocation Table Digital rights management Phishing Voice over IP Sega Saturn E-mail Objective-C Copy protection Internet Group Management Protocol Spyware Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act N-Gage Final Fantasy (video game) BlackBerry

how long can a mobile phone last for under water before it stops working i'm curious as to how long can a mobile phone last for under water before it completely stops working there's two parts to this water is a good conductor of electricity therefore if it's all over the pcb printed circuit board and chip surfaces inside when turned on the electrical signals will short immediately and the phone is likely to stop working if you immerse the phone in water then dry it out completely the oxidisation process will leave crystalised residue all over the components inside and destroy any chance of it working however i have seen phones quickly immersed in water when dropped and then dried out which still work but it's very unlikely and not something to try especially as even a small amount of steam can water damage a phone if you open the back of phones and take off the battery many have a small white disc which changes colour when wet permanently to enable repair centres to identify if it's not working due to water damage which is not covered under most warranties  Printed circuit board Circuit design Thermal power station Transformer Drill bit PCB layout guidelines Toyota Prius Soldering Capacitor GSM services Mobile phone Floppy disk Tesla coil Casting Drowning Sulfuric acid USB flash drive Telephone USS Waters (DD-115) USS Tunny (SS-282) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Microphone Oscilloscope Rail terminology Vacuum tube Naval mine Disc brake Second Battle of the Atlantic Modem Sewage treatment Solar cell Electrical wiring Internal combustion engine Water (molecule) Residual-current device Poker jargon Carbon dioxide Transmitter Diode Jack plug Dry cleaning Transistor Internal ballistics Semiconductor device Action potential Battery electric vehicle USS Anderson (DD-411) Electrical generator Diving suit Sento Gramophone record Ball grid array Renewable energy Antenna (radio) USS Taylor (DD-468) Diving Universal Serial Bus Iowa class battleship Read-only memory USS Wasp (CV-18) Volt Tire USS Walke (DD-723) Glossary of firefighting equipment Digital circuit Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Wind turbine Phreaking Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Fire extinguisher High-voltage hazards Surface-mount technology Unterseeboot 505 Railway signalling USS Ammen (DD-527) NEC Corporation USS Alfred A.

question about starting a cell phone contract i'm and i want to get a cell phone of my own i don't have a credit card and never have therefore i don't have any credit built on my name can i still get a cell phone or would i have to build up good credit first you don't have to build credit to get a cell phone once you are you can go and get a contract just a couple things to keep in mind before you go decided what carrier you want the reason you will want to do this is because each major carrier runs a credit check on you you don't want to many people running credit checks on you effects your credit score anyway the company that usually has the lowest deposit if any is either t mobile or sprint figure out how much is too much for a deposit are you willing to pay more for a deposit or would you rather save that money for a good phone also do the research the companies price plans and extras text message internet usage etc so you know how much you are going to be paying a month also keep in mind that the first bill is going to be higher then what you will talk about with your sales rep because of activation fees and prorated charges like i said just a couple things to keep in mind now the good thing is that once you do get into a contract and pay your bill every month on time this will actually help build your credit in a good way  Virgin Mobile Credit card Internet fraud Skype Verizon Wireless Insurance Bank Global System for Mobile Communications GSM services Solar cell Mutual fund Octopus card FairTax Mobile phone Automatic teller machine Microeconomics Short selling Mortgage Q-Telecom Voice over IP Short message service Social rule Telephone North American Numbering Plan E-mail spam Modem Filling station BlackBerry The Amazing Race Capitalism Payphone 9-1-1 Sprint Nextel Corporation Health insurance Citigroup London Congestion Charge Telephone numbering plan Islamic banking Bond General Packet Radio Service Food and Drug Administration Money Major League Baseball television contracts Tesco Electronic commerce T-Mobile Broadband Internet access Contract Micropayment Credit card fraud Taxation in the United States Public transport Internet Live 8 United Kingdom corporation tax Deflation (economics) Opera (web browser) Abramoff-Reed Indian Gambling Scandal Cruising (maritime) Phone sex Cheque Euro Satchel Paige Poker jargon Tom DeLay AT&T N-Gage U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 NEC Corporation Eircom Monetary policy Tax Phreaking Certificate of deposit Advance fee fraud Instant messaging Federal Standard 1037C Intellectual property Annuity Telephone tapping Electronic Arts Enron Corporation EFTPOS Education in Germany Slashdot subculture Economy of Russia Cellular network Minimum wage Hyperinflation Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
