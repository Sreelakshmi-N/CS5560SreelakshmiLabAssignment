cribbage play anyone ever played handed cribbage if so how do you play it as i was growing up my old man would sometimes take me to his weekly crib game and depending on who was in town we played handed handed and even handed crib there are two versions of the player game is often called captains crib where the dealer is the captain and the other two people act as partners to defeat the captain everyone takes turns at being the captain the second is cut throat where everyone is against everyone when we played handed this is is how it was played the card version of crib as opposed to the american card version was played the person right of the dealer the person who last had the crib would put their single throwaway card back into the deck everyone else would put theirs into the crib we played with two teams and an odd person it was easy for us to decide teams cause one team was me dad and the other was the husband wife friends play would be done as normal crib except the odd persons points were doubled good if a nice hand bad if a poor one you could play all against each other with the throwaway card heading to crib as above but i found it quite interesting with the doubling of points and the pegging point blocks the older wiser one's used to employ against him i used to think the odd person was at a disadvantge like when one of the teams had pegged out and it became effectively against but they always played a dime or as we call it ten cents a hole just to add bragging rights and the individual money jars would go up and down each week but over the many years they played no top ups were required the cut of the deck is the same and all other play is the same as in normal crib i can't imagine the game working with a card deal but with a card deal the game was still quite interesting both tactically and socially  Poker jargon Card game Blackjack Contract bridge Cheating in poker Mao (game) Euchre Dominoes Betting (poker) Sheepshead Spades Draw poker Baccarat Piquet Table tennis Community card poker Skat Glossary of American football UNO (game) Volleyball Texas hold 'em Seventh Sea (collectible card game) ROOK 500 (card game) Stud poker Shuffle Baseball Poker Star Trek Customizable Card Game Craps Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Oh Hell Yu-Gi-Oh!

in texas holdem nl event who do you think would win a heads up mike matusow or jamie gold me and my friend were arguing over who would win i said mike and he said gold it really depends on who gets lucky i really think that poker even texas holdem nl is more than luck despite what the experts will tell you now if they start out with the same chip count and noone gets a lucky streak and the winning depends entirely on play making as opposed to hand making i do believe that jamie gold may have a bit of an edge i despise the guy and think that he is as cocky as anything but he is less likely to lose his temper and his head edit please mike matusow is overrated another edit maverick maverick maverick gosh why do you resort to calling people names when they happen to have a dissenting opinion i happen to think mike matusow is overrated you cite instances when he won so what moneymaker won the wsop main event he sucks even scotty nguyen has won the wsop main event and he sucks more than anybody point is just because someone has won something major doesn't mean he's the greatest no limit player on the planet it's all subjective you ask people who the best player is and they will all have dissenting opinions there's just no way to make a case so jamie gold caught a lot of lucky breaks to win the wsop everyone needs to catch a lucky break now and then to win anything just because he got lucky doesn't mean he sucks i think he can play pretty well at times make mistake at other times i can't really say that he's a better player than matusow but he's irritating and if you want to win against matusow the best way to do it is to irritate him that's why i think gold would win p s i think they're both overrated to me the best texas holdem nl player is ted forrest but again that is subjective  Texas hold 'em World Series of Poker World Series of Poker, 2005 Poker jargon Doyle Brunson Omaha hold 'em Stu Ungar Mike Matusow T.

can any one let me know the secrect to win in limted game texas holdem please i'm sorry to say but there is no secret to playing winning poker you just have to know when you should make a play at a pot or when you should fold the more you play the more you will know what hands you should be playing in the first place that's the great thing about poker you will always get the same starting hands but you will never play them the same way and you will never have the same situation twice hands have no set value in poker so in one spot i will fold a hand like k q and in another spot i will play it for a raise playing position and playing tight aggresive poker is the way to go now there are diffrences between limit hold and no limit for sure first you will have more players in each flop because you can't bet to get others out of the pot you will also have weaker hands in each pot as well since they are getting good oods to stay in the pot most times bluffing the pot is a lot more limited and you are always getting a good price to chase draws because of this i limp a lot with a wide range of hands and if i have it i bet and if i don't i check and go away the only time i really will make a stone cold bluff on a pot is if im in good position or if i am heads up i myself play tight at limit tables but i will also play a lot more trash as well since i'll be getting a good price to do so in some spots and i can get payed off in big pots with bad hands  Texas hold 'em Betting (poker) Draw poker Omaha hold 'em Poker Bluff (poker) Poker tournament Poker strategy Community card poker Stud poker Sandbagging (poker) Seven-card stud Cheating in poker Online poker T.

could someone please teach me how to play texas hold em i have used websites but still dont understand please help play begins with each player being dealt two cards face down like most poker games the deck is a standard card deck no jokers these cards are the player's hole or pocket cards these are the only cards each player will receive individually and they will only possibly be revealed at the showdown making texas hold 'em a closed poker game the hand begins with a pre flop betting round beginning with the player to the left of the big blind or the player to the left of the dealer if no blinds are used and continuing clockwise a round of betting continues until every player has either folded put in all of their chips or matched the amount put in by all other active players see betting for a detailed account note that the blinds are considered live in the pre flop betting round meaning that they contribute to the amount that the blind player must contribute and that if all players call around to the player in the big blind position that player may either check or raise after the pre flop betting round assuming there remain at least two players taking part in the hand the dealer deals a flop three face up community cards the flop is followed by a second betting round this and all subsequent betting rounds begin with the player to the dealer's left and continue clockwise after the flop betting round ends a single community card called the turn or fourth street is dealt followed by a third betting round a final single community card called the river or fifth street is then dealt followed by a fourth betting round and the showdown if necessary if a player bets and all other players fold then the remaining player is awarded the pot and is not required to show his hole cards if two or more players remain after the final betting round a showdown occurs on the showdown each player plays the best five card poker hand he can make from the seven cards comprising his two hole cards and the five community cards a player may use both of his own two hole cards only one or none at all to form his final five card hand if the five community cards form the player's best hand then the player is said to be playing the board and can only hope to split the pot since each other player can also use the same five cards to construct the same hand if the best hand is shared by more than one player then the pot is split equally among them with any extra chips going to the first players after the button in clockwise order it is common for players to have closely valued but not identically ranked hands nevertheless one must be careful in determining the best hand if the hand involves fewer than five cards such as two pair or three of a kind then kickers are used to settle ties see the second example below note that the card's numerical rank is of sole importance suit values are irrelevant in hold'em for a list of hands http www e pokerusa com website images gen pokerhands jpg  Poker tournament Cheating in poker President (game) Contract bridge Canasta Pai gow poker Dominoes Hearts (game) Baccarat Card game Card Sharks Euchre Slot machine High card by suit (poker) Cribbage Sheepshead Bluff (poker) 500 (card game) Poker strategy Oh Hell Sandbagging (poker) Playing card Skat Mao (game) Gambling Big Two Tournament Caribbean stud poker Online poker Craps Gin rummy Football (soccer) Suit (cards) Fischer Random Chess ROOK Snooker Egyptian Ratscrew Draw (poker) Tic-Tac-Dough UNO (game) Dice $ale of the Century Monopoly (game) Playoff Game show Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game The Joker's Wild Video poker Monty Hall problem Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Golf Poker Superstars Invitational Tournament Trick-taking game Pai Gow Piquet VS System Magic: The Gathering Three card monte Doomtown National Football League Bad beat Ra (board game) Shuffle Extreme Programming Chess terminology Maverick (film) Let's Make a Deal Sports betting Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Winning Streak Surreal number Wheel of Fortune Textile manufacturing Pok__mon Trading Card Game Tag Memoir '44 Clarinet Playoff format Tilt (poker) Whist American football strategy New England Patriots FA Cup

how do you play uno i also need to know some rules as well each player is dealt cards with the remaining ones placed face down to form a draw pile the top card of the draw pile is turned over to begin a discard pile the first player has to match the card in the discard pile either by number color or word for example if the card is a red player must throw down a red card or any color or the player can throw down a wild card if the player doesn't have anything to match he must pick a card from the draw pile if he can play what is drawn great otherwise play moves to the next person when you have one card left you must yell uno meaning one failure to do this results in you having to pick two cards from the draw pile that is of course if you get caught by the other players once a player has no cards left the hand is over points are scored see scoring section and you start over again that's uno in a nutshell choosing a dealer each player picks a card the player who picks the highest number deals if you picked a word card too bad they don't count player to the left of the dealer starts play starting a discard pile well if a word card is the first one turned up from the draw pile this is what happens wild draw four it's put back in the deck and another one is chosen wild card the player to the left of the dealer calls out a color then plays draw two card the player to the left of dealer must pick two cards and then the next player goes sad but true reverse card the dealer plays first but then goes to the right instead of the left skip card the player to the left of dealer doesn't start get it he's skipped the player to the left of him starts what word cards mean draw two cards when this card is played the next person to play must draw cards and forfeit his turn reverse card simply reverse direction of play play left becomes play right and vice versa skip card the next player to play loses his turn and is skipped mighty clever wild card this card can be played on any card the person playing the card calls any color to continue play including the one presently being played if desired a wild card can be played even if the player has another playable card in his hand wild draw four card this is the best meanest most sneaky card to have not only does the player get to call the next color played but the next player has to pick cards and forfeit his turn there is a hitch however of course you can only play this card when you don't have a card in your hand that matches the color of the card previously played note a player may have a matching number or word card of a different color in his hand and plays his wild draw four card what are these extra cards for blank card this is a special card that you may use in one of two ways if a card from your uno deck is lost or damaged you may use the blank card as a replacement example if you find that your deck is missing one of the yellow 's you would simply replace it by taking the yellow blank card marking a on it and adding it back into the deck if you family has a special uno rule you prefer to play with you may write that rule on the blank cards and add them straight to the deck going out a player who forgets to say uno before his card touches the discard pile but catches himself before any other player catches him is safe and is not subject to the penalty you may not catch a player for failure to say uno until his second to last card touches the discard pile also you may not catch a player for failure to say uno after the next player begins his turn beginning a turn is defines as either drawing a card from the draw pile or drawing a card from your hand to play if the last card played in a hand is a draw two or wild draw four card the next player must draw the two or four cards these cards are counted when points are totaled if no one is out of cards by the time the draw pile is depleted reshuffle and continue play scoring when a player is out of cards he gets points for cards left in the opponent's hands as follows all cards through face value draw points reverse points skip points wild points wild draw points the winner is the first player to reach points however the game may be scored by keeping a running total of points of each player is caught with at the end of each hand when one player reaches points the player with the lowest points is the winner  Crazy Eights Stud poker Tag Cheating in poker Hearts (game) Big Two Euchre Yu-Gi-Oh!

if anyone plays dmo on byond this question is for you can you please make me a good deck this is for dmo duel monsters online players on byond the reason why is because there isnt all the cards in the card game so i need a deck that uses only cards that are in dmo dear kazperaa your pertinent question and urgent curiosity will unfortunately get buried under more legitimate concerns if you don t get a good answer within hours it is best to delete your query and ask again kazperaa i would like to take this opportunity to express my personal opinion you have been foolish kazperaa very very foolish anyone can see that the purpose of yahoo answers is to serve as a modern chatroom more and more java programming is becoming less and less supported there is no other method of bringing people together in a social environment than to create php scripts where the thinking can be done on the server rather than on your machine with that in mind kazperaa you should interrogate the shallow minded participants of yahoo answers with matters that appeal to their common denominator questions such as how long is the normal tally whacker or my boyfriend says i should dump my hubby what you think would get you a substantial number of replies give up your pursuit of truth and petty wonders kazperaa quit asking bland colorless questions are you naive no person who is capable of giving you the answer you hope for can last while reading though a heap of puddings pies and pastry i m only doing you a favor kazperaa by giving you a proper admonishment you can now begin to formulate an apology when you are ready send your atonement to http answers yahoo com my my ylt aq etur d ebszbghxjwjq py ix and kazperaa if you insist upon asking serious questions remember that a few good jolts from a peace officer s tazor should bring you around to your senses please check your spelling and throw some slang into the mix so you don t offend any of the egos lurking waiting to give you the smack down with crass thoughtless one liners thank you kazperaa and have a great day jake  Poker jargon A Course In Miracles Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Yu-Gi-Oh!

magic the gathering what does x mana cost mean iv seen some cards like that and saince i use blue i would like to know for alot of spells and instants thanks it says things like it needs grey two blue and an x x is a variable amount of colorless any color mana usually there is a the more the better link with effect for example hurricane cost x g and does x damage to all flyers and players what exactly x stands for should be indicated on the card if it is not odds are you found a misprint got trade it to a collector nut for a regular copy and some other good cards on top for blue the following is of interest for purposes of countering a variable cost spell with a variable cost spell the target spell's total converted mana cost is equal to the amount of mana actually used for spells that say couter target spell unless its caster pays x x should be the number of untapped lands your opponent controls if you can't invest that much you'll usually want to save the counter  Mirrodin Magic: The Gathering Urza's Saga Ravnica: City of Guilds Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Diablo II Yu-Gi-Oh!

question about magus the future magic it says that you may play the top card of your library does that mean that you still have to pay its casting cost like as if it were in your hand or may you just play it w o casting cost and another question about barbed shockers if lets say i have barbed shockers that dealt combat damage to the opponent does that mean that he she has to discard his her hand and draw the same amount of cards twice or just once re magus of the future the only thing that it allows you to do is play the top card of your library normally you can only play cards from your hand per game rules magus of the future alters that rule however it doesn't modify the process for playing a card so you still have to pay for the card when you play it only effects that specifically say play without paying the mana cost or some such make it so that you don't have to pay for the card you can look up related rulings involving the card future sight re barbed shockers yes the opponent will have to discard his her hand twice and draw that many cards twice each barbed shocker has a separate triggered ability and they resolve one at a time if your opponent has four cards in hand he will have to discard those draw four cards then discard those and draw four more some good with megrim  Poker jargon Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Magic: The Gathering Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Blackjack Draw poker Canasta Mao (game) Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)

naruto cards hi i was wondering if anybody could tell me the rules for both players when conducting a mental power battle and how this is conducted please a mental power is only conducted by the effect of another card ie cheating shikamaru's effect the only difference between a regular battle and a mental power battle is that instead of using the combat support values of the ninja you use the mental power of the ninjas which is found in the information line which includes things like gender village and rank mental power battles are fought at the sime time as regular battles and one team cannot have both a regular battle and a mental battle at the same time  Nara Shikamaru Naruto (manga) Hatake Kakashi Characters of Naruto Uzumaki Naruto Pok__mon Trading Card Game Uchiha Sasuke Rock Lee Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 3 Naruto ninja ranks Naruto geography Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 4 Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 2 Hyuga Neji Martial art Contract bridge Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Blackjack Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen Naruto jutsu Canasta Playoff Mao (game) StarCraft Secret Missions Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)

pokemon and magic cards while cleaning up my room i found the great remnants of an old past time of mine pokemon and magic the gathering the pokemon cards i have are from the very early era pokemon st edition and some fossil the magic cards i have are mainly tempest th and th along with many others some as old as arabian nights are these cards worth anything would you reccomend selling them or keep on waiting well if you have no intention of ever playing those games again selling them should be a good idea every tcg has a limited life span in the case of magic they do not allow players to use the older cards on current tournaments so every year you hold on to the cards they lose value  Pok__mon Trading Card Game Yu-Gi-Oh!

do u know any do u know any card games like i already know of spoons slap jack eypgipian rats war and all that but i wanna know a fun card game my best friend and i play michigan rummy whenever we get the chance it is a little long and you have to meet certain rules to complete a hand i don't know if it has any other names as i only know it as michigan rummy it works very similar to regular rummy in its matching and drawing discarding however you may only take the top card and if it is not your turn you must buy it by taking it and one from the draw pile the first round is hands as follows groups minimum of the same face value i e qqq runs minimum of the same suit in succession i e a of spades group run these hands are dealt cards the second round is dealt cards each hand hands groups groups and run runs and group runs no discard like gin on the last hand with no discard all cards must be used to complete the hand otherwise the final card must be discarded each player can play from the other players piles by adding the next card in order but not until they have also started piles the object is to get all cards out of your hand the lowest score is the winner any cards held in the hand when someone goes out are counted as points by face value all face cards and aces are counted as you must discard to complete the hand except on the no discard final hand and after every draw if you have four or more players you will need two decks no jokers this one has been alot of fun for us and i have taught it to some of my family members and it is one that we have played for years good luck and have fun with it  Canasta President (game) Mahjong Poker jargon Mao (game) Draw poker Card game Crazy Eights Cribbage Stud poker Dominoes Sheepshead Betting (poker) Skat Contract bridge Suit (cards) Spades UNO (game) Euchre Big Two Blackjack Oh Hell Piquet ROOK Playing card Community card poker 500 (card game) Card Sharks Texas hold 'em Ra (board game) Magic: The Gathering Cheating in poker Finesse Trick-taking game Omaha hold 'em The Joker's Wild Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)

im magic the gathering what card is green but is actually blue i see a need to reiterate the first two answers with more detail i suppose what you are looking for is indeed the revised edition misprint of serendib efreet which was printed with a green creature layout but is a actually blue creature the first answer assumes you might be thinking of an alternate reality card from the time spiral block's planar chaos set but harmonize is green with a green card layout it's just the effect that is typical of blue in real magic  Revised (Magic: The Gathering) Magic: The Gathering Magic: The Gathering sets Mirage (Magic: The Gathering) Yu-Gi-Oh!

help me with my yu gi oh deck i'm going back to playing yu gi oh and i've never been good at making a good deck i've made one just now but i'm not sure if its good or not look over it and tell me what you think be completely honest tell me what cards i should get what should i remove etc monsters newdoria spirit reaper elemental hero wildheart gear golem the moving fortress mad dog of darkness golem sentry poison mummy mask of darkness blindly loyal goblin kelbek regenerating mummy penguin soldier ancient gear golem summoned skull vampire lord spells last will premature burial axe of despair enemy controller tribute to the doomed gravekeeper's servant poison of the old man magical mallet wave motion cannon swords of revealing light scapegoat mystical space typhoon nobleman of crossout pot of avarice heavy storm traps a hero emerges waboku magic jammer trap hole shadow spell seven tools of the bandit call of the haunted sakuretsu armor remember to tell me what you think of my deck as well as what to put in and or take out remember to tell me what you think of my deck as well as what to put in and or take out and also i'm using the forbidden list to make my deck so i won't be using any forbidden cards in this deck i also want to stay in the card minimum one more thing i forgot that last will was forbidden my bad you are making a mistake that most people make when they put together a deck you don't have a really good strategy it looks like you are trying for a defensive zombie deck that just doesn't work too well the zombie monsters started out with usually little to no defense and even though they have been gaining more defense as time goes on there still isn't a huge amount of defensive zombies you also seem to have several earth monsters what i'm saying is that you don't have an overall goal to make you win as you know the object of the game is to win by making your opponents life points to go to zero or using exodia ect so you should ask yourself what is the best way to go about doing it you can sit back and let them come at you and destroy them with traps flip effects ect but would you be able to hold them long enough to put your master plan in motion assuming you have a master plan without one sitting back on defense would be suicide or you could go on the offensive and try to kill them with your monsters but can you kill their monsters and still be able to get past their traps you have to choose which one you do and you have to build a deck around that strategy lets say you go on the offensive as i think that's the best idea what cards go together best you need to make sure that your cards don't hurt the overall strategy like having a cyber jar in an exodia deck they need to all flow together smoothly helping each other what if you had your shadow spell holding an opponents strongest monster then you used your heavy storm it would release their monster and possibly make you lose that is the main thing to watch out for inconsistencies between the cards once you get all those eliminated you will be able to start carefully adding better cards and making your overall strategy better but be carefull don't add too many cards i make it a rule to never go above fifty cards in a deck i hope that i've helped you  Waking the Dragons Poker jargon RuneScape quests Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)
