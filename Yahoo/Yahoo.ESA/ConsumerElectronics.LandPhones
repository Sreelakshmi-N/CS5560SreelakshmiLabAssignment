ploblems with the sbc connection called sbc tech phone tech adt tech im having a problem everytime the phone rings or we use the phone i get disconnected from the internet ive called sbc and everywhere that would have something to do with it and they where no help i acually spoke with the sbc supervisor twice no help what should i do i do not have dial up you didn't mention whether you had dial up or dsl if you have dial up you will lose your connection when the phone is used if you have dsl i would guess that a filter could be the culprit at each phone connection there should be a dsl filter which will have two ports one for the phone and one for the computer the filter blocks the higher frequencies the computer data is sent with from interfering with the phone and the lower frequency audio from interfering with the data transmissions i would check all of the connections on all your phones to make sure the filter is properly installed if you find nothing then disconnect them and try each one by one until you hopefully find a bad one and then replace it i suppose that it is possible that if you are using dsl and have your dial up modem still connected to the computer and phone line and it is on that that could be also be the cause  Digital Subscriber Line Modem Bluetooth Telephone Broadband Internet access Phreaking Voice over IP Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Telephone exchange GSM services Federal Standard 1037C Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Dialer Ethernet Internet Low-pass filter Transmission Control Protocol NTSC Wi-Fi UK telephone numbering plan Atari 8-bit family Dual-tone multi-frequency Prodigy (ISP) Domain-specific programming language IEEE 802.11 Digital signal processing Cable television Mobile phone Private branch exchange Vertical service code X.25 ITU-T Serial communications Skype AT&T HomePNA Universal Serial Bus Global System for Mobile Communications Software-defined radio Apple Newton USB flash drive Asynchronous Transfer Mode Telephone tapping NorthwesTel Broadband Hayes command set Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Whois Nordic Mobile Telephone Super Nintendo Entertainment System Telephone call Power line communication Loudspeaker Commodore 64 Blue box Predictive dialer Computer network Television Router Circuit design Radio Coding theory Amateur radio Transformer E-mail spam Capacitor Hardware random number generator Common Unix Printing System Digital photography Telephone number Phone fraud Malware IPod Digital camera Aliasing Global Positioning System Alcatel Coaxial cable Multiplayer Softmodem Code division multiple access Floppy disk Phase-locked loop Communications protocol Universal Mobile Telecommunications System FM broadcasting Single-sideband modulation Dial-up access Buffer overflow 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Cable modem Computer hardware IP Multimedia Subsystem Laserdisc

is there a purpose for private calling just wondering people do not like to give out there phone number sometimes because people break the etiquette of caller id just because i called you with my number unblocked doesn't give you the right to write my number down and call me if i did not give you my number or tell you that you can take my number from the caller id i hate when people just assume it is ok for them to get my number from the caller id and call me back especially when i call a customers contact number to get access to there home or apartment and they are not home instead of calling the office they will call my cell phone back that they got the number from caller id and try to reschedule with me directly things dont work like that if people followed some etiquette and used discretion in taking peoples phone numbers from cid with out the persons permission then perhaps private calling would not be needed but until people learn some common decency then many people will continue to block there number whenever possible its like if i dont tell you my address but i tell you that i am going home and you follow me so you can find out where i live  North American Numbering Plan Telephone tapping Telephone numbering plan Caller ID Call for help UK telephone numbering plan GSM services Emergency telephone number Cellular network Private branch exchange FidoNet Mach kernel Vertical service code Glossary of partner dance terms Telephone exchange Automatic number identification Surveillance 9-1-1 Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Telephone number Enhanced 911 Customs and etiquette of Japan Voice over IP Call centre Avenue Q Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Payphone Telephone booth Integrated Services Digital Network Sauna 555 telephone number Toll-free telephone number X.25 Telephone call Phone sex Pointer Identity theft Phone fraud Privacy Rush Limbaugh Linked list Ocean's Twelve Spring operating system Ethics Social rule Skype Friends United Airlines Flight 93 Speech recognition Code division multiple access CPU cache The Big Sleep Sin City Database management system Hiking The Inside Contredanse The Jim Rome Show Unconditional Love Data retention Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Atomic Kitten Extreme Programming Computer Caller (dance) Taxicab Telephone switchboard Funeral British national identity card 24 (television) C syntax Prank call Area code 905 Mail Japanese mobile phone culture Nordic Mobile Telephone Car Talk Mojave people Disability etiquette Whois Apollo Guidance Computer Survivor (novel) Matt Hardy Poker jargon Bluetooth Coding theory Wi-Fi Coast to Coast AM Betting (poker) Japanese titles IP Multimedia Subsystem AT&T Mobile phone spam Prostate cancer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Etiquette PDP-8 Direct marketing Human sexual behavior

how do i find someones phone number how do i find a phone number when i dont know the name of the person nor the postcode only part of the address i think there's an issue here with not knowing their name i don't think that directory enquiries any of them will give you the details if you do not know the name in case you are making a prank or nuisance call you may be able to find out the rest of their address though you could also try the electoral roll for that street it should be a matter of public record at your local council useful for when there is an election there used to be books called street directories years ago and they would give you the name of the person as well as the address unless it's a very recent move or a new build you could ask in your local library about street directories solicitors often have access to street directories as well you could bluff and say you are doing some research into the neighbourhood changes within a particular group of streets and ask if you can look at some street directories  Telephone directory UK telephone numbering plan Postcode Liberal Democrats (UK) North American Numbering Plan Surveillance Emergency telephone number Toowoomba, Queensland Yellow Pages Solicitor Identity theft Five Dock, New South Wales Enhanced 911 Spring operating system Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 6 Telephone number Plame affair Lawyer Directory assistance Library (computer science) Barrister Virgin Mobile FidoNet Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Summer Hill, New South Wales Municipality of Strathfield 9-1-1 Open access File system Legal research Open Directory Project Phreaking Mach kernel Telephone numbering plan Glasgow Virtual memory Vertical service code Files-11 Local government in the United Kingdom Database management system Sampling (statistics) Fathers' rights movement in the UK Password Newtown, New South Wales Tanzania Genealogy Democracy Sunspot Library United States House of Representatives University of Bristol Omagh RISC New Zealand Parliament Windows 2000 John Kerr United Kingdom corporation tax Directory service Mauritania Nuisance Library and information science Darlinghurst, New South Wales Computer Traditionalist Catholic Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Slovenia Suburbs of Johannesburg Government of France Roman Catholic Church French Directory Wi-Fi Telephone tapping Waramanga, Australian Capital Territory E.164 Payphone Perl Address (geography) Public key infrastructure Linked list Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Single Transferable Vote Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 7 Cleveland, Ohio Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory British national identity card 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Ward (politics) AmigaOS Scots law Spam (electronic) AppleTalk Commune in France Postal code Revision control Zimbabwe parliamentary elections, 2005 Address Book (software) Education Political campaign European Union U.S. presidential election, 2004

operator manual for bullard inchvtl why the do not call list isn't working have you continued to get telemarketing calls even though you re on the federal do not call list i found out why internet phone calling is not included in the scope of the law so american companies have been hiring telemarketers outside the states and using them to call you with their sales pitches i plan to contact the federal trade commission to ask if this is legal when the do not call list was created no one thought about the possibility of calls coming from overseas so we ll let you know what we find out also keep in mind that you must re register on the list every couple of years to keep telemarketers away there are a few exceptions if you did business with a bank for months after your last account activity the bank can legally call you and any marketing partner of the bank can call you also politicians and charities are allowed to call  Telemarketing National Do Not Call Registry Direct marketing Customer relationship management Corporation United Kingdom corporation tax Management Enron Corporation Euro Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Investment bank Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act National Kidney Foundation Singapore Credit repair Mutual fund Wal-Mart Octopus card Phishing Tesco Mortgage Bond Citigroup Predictive dialer Identity theft E-mail spam Privacy Trademark Security (finance) Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Civil union Intellectual property Publishing Business Bank Public domain Child pornography European Union Gross domestic product Telephone numbering plan Plame affair SCO-Linux controversies Database marketing Telephone tapping British nationality law Advance fee fraud World government Wall Street EGovernment Bank of China (Hong Kong) Independent agencies of the United States government Charitable trust Corporate governance Telstra Software patent debate Offshoring Interstate Highway Legal tender Temasek Holdings Domestic partnerships in California Copyright Phone fraud Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Dun & Bradstreet FairTax Copyright law of the United Kingdom United Overseas Bank AT&T Same-sex marriage GSM services Vodafone Government of India Act 1935 Microsoft Eircom Microeconomics Conspiracy Ross School of Business Economy of Russia Citizens' band radio Business continuity planning Accountancy Marketing Trade union Goldman Sachs First-sale doctrine Trust (Law) USA International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict U.S. presidential election, 2000 Sales Call centre Florida Central Voter File Elections in the United States Burr Redding Fathers' rights Modchip Soci__t__ G__n__rale Barry Minkow Taxicab Telephone directory Political divisions of the United States

is it possible to hack into a multi line phone system to make a call look like it was tranferred internally a coworker of mine keeps getting harassed at work by an ex boyfriend at first he kept sending her e mails but she was able to block them so now he constantly calls her at work weird thing is when he calls he's somehow blocking his number on the caller id so that it says the call is being transfered from an inside line when he's actually calling from a line in a different state and no one in the office is transferring the call to her we do not have numbers to call our extensions directly the caller has to dial a main line and type in the extension but when you do this it doesn't normally show up as a transfered call it shows the number that is calling is he hacking into our phone system or something and how can we stop it or block his number when he's making it come from an internal line it is possible that he is going into someone's voicemail to leave a message and then backing out and going to her extension on some phone systems if you do this it will show as an internal transfer instead of calling straight in depending on how much of an issue this is and what kind of a relationship you have with your company you can contact the vendor that supports your phone system and speak with them about a solution there are a lot of different phone systems out there and they all have different programming and features i don't know what kind of system you have so i would contact the vendor that currently supports it any decent system will have the ability to block voicemail to extension transfers it is also possible that he is simply blocking his caller id which anyone can do and the phone system doesn't know how to interpret that signal it is then going to some kind of a default that may appear as an internal transfer your phone vendor can also block calls that are coming from people that are blocking their caller id i would also recommend that your co worker speak with someone in your hr department since this is company time and company property that he is dealing with they may want to take certain actions to stop him from a legal standpoint  UK telephone numbering plan Telephone numbering plan Caller ID GSM services Telephone number Vertical service code Private branch exchange FidoNet Skype Mach kernel Telephone exchange Cellular network North American Numbering Plan Toll-free telephone number Modem Call for help Phreaking Gmail Emergency telephone number Voice over IP Glossary of partner dance terms Telephone tapping Spam (electronic) AmigaOS Pretty Good Privacy Universal Serial Bus C plus plus 9-1-1 Domain Name System Dual-tone multi-frequency United Airlines Flight 93 Speech recognition X Window System Automatic number identification Phone fraud Hacker Musical Instrument Digital Interface Virgin Mobile E-mail spam Telephone booth Presence information Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Blue box Enhanced 911 XML CPU cache IP Multimedia Subsystem Phone sex Computer virus C programming language Bluetooth Netfilter/iptables Internet fraud GunZ The Duel Verizon Wireless ITunes Pointer Mad Money Stopping e-mail abuse Telephone Session Initiation Protocol Public domain Customer relationship management Apple Open Collaboration Environment Surveillance OpenDocument Hard disk International Phonetic Alphabet Predictive dialer Beltway sniper attacks Virtual memory Enterprise content management Taxicab Opera (web browser) Ethernet Computer Common Unix Printing System Pocket PC Emacs Scrubs (TV show) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus BlackBerry Objective-C Morse Code Social rule Caller (dance) Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Rent (musical) ITU-T Pirate decryption PostgreSQL Object-oriented programming Global System for Mobile Communications

vonage if you have it what are the pro s and cons i am sick of my phone company and the ridiculous prices i keep seeing these vonage ads but i m skeptical if you have vonage please share your experience and tell me if they are all they say they are how exactly does it work and if you had it to do all over again would you please provide feedback thanks only down sides for vonage for me have been lost packets when using internet connection for heavy surfing vpn connections resulting in stutter on voice line vonage doesn't use rsvp so there is no guarantee that you'll be able to maintain bandwidth while you use your internet connection not saying that you can't but there is an effect using a cable company telephone service like comcast or such isn't impacted by the internet usage as the signal is carried on a different frequency on the cable than that used by the high speed internet also i have frequently experienced delayed voice messages for voice mail up to days on vonage have complained many times over past years they never have dealt with that all that said i am very cheap and like the phone svc with taxes over and above the increased realiability of traditional lec based phones they stay up when power is out or the cable vendor phone plans i won't switch until they go under from the current lawsuit brought by verizon for patent infringement ultimately i think vonage will go under but i'm going to ride it down as long as i can btw the lec's spread this stuff about not being able to be located when you call not true you do have to register your address with vonage so that the information can be sent to the call center just one extra step  Voice over IP Telephone Integrated Services Digital Network Modem Broadband Internet access Session Initiation Protocol Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Asynchronous Transfer Mode Cable television Phreaking 9-1-1 Telephone exchange Telegraphy IP Multimedia Subsystem Enhanced 911 Telephone tapping Digital Subscriber Line Frame relay Radio Skype Packet switching Bluetooth Television AT&T Ethernet Private branch exchange Cellular network Global System for Mobile Communications Network Switching Subsystem Toll-free telephone number Wi-Fi Internet service provider WiMAX Amateur radio Direct marketing Public Switched Telephone Network TiVo Mobile phone Morse Code Sprint Nextel Corporation General Packet Radio Service Spam (electronic) Universal Serial Bus Central processing unit Denial-of-service attack Audiophile Mouse (computing) E-mail Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line America Online Quality of service Electronic amplifier Google X.25 Coaxial cable Network effect Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Oscilloscope Antenna (radio) Public transport Transmission Control Protocol Teletext IEEE 802.11 NSA encryption systems Communications protocol Gmail Password Telephone numbering plan Bell System CDMA2000 Tesco Audio data compression CPU cache Loudspeaker Virtual private network Broadband Networks Submarine communications cable Electric power transmission Radio clock Global Positioning System XML High-voltage direct current Power line communication Telstra ITU-T Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Radiotelephone Software patent debate AppleTalk NTSC CompuServe Digital television Differentiated services

do you incur idd charges when you call an overseas toll free line say if i call a toll free line in us from singapore will it be toll free for me or only for the us locals you might have a charge there isn't a perfect universal law on this one what's happening of course is you're dialing the number for the states after your international access code in singapore now singtel or starhub or will have to give that call over to carrier they're connected with to ultimately land it in the states so maybe they give it to at t as part of their contract to exchange business it's likely at t will accept it no problem and get it to the end user maybe a business in new york city for no extra cost but there's a fair chance that your local operator in singapore will charge you a fee from singtel's side they've likely signed a contract to exchange traffic with at t in this case at t can send them m minutes per month and maybe singtel can send m back to the states the toll free calls count in their limit their other option is to sell those minutes outright or put them on the international wholesale voice market and sell them so giving away free ones might be ok if it's just a few but they're likely to at least charge you a little bit of something  Telephone numbering plan Broadband Internet access Toll-free telephone number Virgin Mobile Toll road Voice over IP Singapore Telecommunications Cable television BlackBerry Modem UK telephone numbering plan Eircom Communications in Singapore Phone fraud Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Singapore Private branch exchange StarHub North American Numbering Plan Airline Skype Telegraphy Interstate Highway Optus FidoNet Singapore Changi Airport Phreaking United States Postal Service Insurance London Congestion Charge Public good Taxation in the United States GSM services Hong Kong International Airport History of Singapore System/36 Temasek Holdings Octopus card Emergency telephone number 9-1-1 Local exchange carrier Short selling Blue box Telephone exchange Narita International Airport Internet fraud Security (finance) Telephone number E-mail Toll bridge NorthwesTel GNU General Public License Digital Subscriber Line Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Public domain Singapore Airlines U.S. Highway 1 Freeway CPU cache Tax Asian financial crisis 407 ETR Tesco Transport in Hong Kong American individualist anarchism Price discrimination Short message service Derivative (finance) Elis Prefecture Internet Relay Chat Zoning Pennsylvania Turnpike SCO-Linux controversies America Online Ethernet Pan American World Airways Futures contract Road pricing Internet Ryanair United Airlines Filling station Neopets Air New Zealand Transmission Control Protocol Mortgage Laws of Singapore Straits Times Index Open source culture Publicly funded medicine Wal-Mart Referendum Electric power transmission Data retention Gross domestic product Credit card System/34 Telephone tapping

anyone use skype for regular home phone use i was checking out the site and saw that you can get unlimited calling in the us canada for per year which works out to less than per month sounds like a good deal but i'd love to hear from people who use it what are the disadvantages can you keep your same phone number when switching or are you assigned a new one and any comments about what you like dislike about it would be great thanks is for out calling you would still need to purchace an in phone number and voicemail if you want people to call you from regular phone lines all in all it still comes out to less then a year that equals about months service for the next cheapest service i have the ata phone adapter so i can use my regular house phone connected to the skype there is a slight learning curve to use the service when you first start but for the amount of savings i think that it i worth it for residential as long as you have a cell for back up most skype phones require your pc to stay on there are some wifi phones that you can use with skype that dosent require your pc to be connected so if you need to shut down or reboot your pc your phone will not work untill the pc is powered back up hopefully you are not doing any updates to your pc or your pc dosent crash while you are on the phone skype is not yet at a point that i would recommend it for business lines but for residential it is a great service for the price skype is not compatible with fax machines or dial up networking if this is something you are intrested in or need then check vonage or some other voip provider not a softphone like skype  Skype 9-1-1 Telephone numbering plan Private branch exchange Telephone Phreaking UK telephone numbering plan North American Numbering Plan Telephone number Wi-Fi Modem Caller ID GSM services Broadband Internet access Bluetooth Enhanced 911 Telephone exchange IP Multimedia Subsystem Virgin Mobile Telkom Mobile phone Windows 2000 Windows XP Digital Subscriber Line Integrated Services Digital Network Telegraphy Session Initiation Protocol WiMAX Q-Telecom 555 telephone number Television Telephone tapping Internet Dual-tone multi-frequency ITU-T Emergency telephone number Universal Serial Bus Call centre FidoNet Network Switching Subsystem Short message service Predictive dialer HomePNA Surveillance Global System for Mobile Communications Sprint Nextel Corporation Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Cellular network Eircom Vertical service code Verizon Wireless Etisalat Japanese mobile phone culture Data retention IiNet AT&T BlackBerry Podcasting Rogers Telecom Web crawler TransUnion Redundant array of independent disks General Packet Radio Service Gmail E.164 Trillian (instant messenger) Social software Toll-free telephone number Hard disk Public Switched Telephone Network Pocket PC Spam (electronic) NorthwesTel T-Mobile Musical Instrument Digital Interface MSN Messenger Rogers Communications Federal Standard 1037C 2003 North America blackout Telephone call Enterprise content management Phone fraud Instant messaging Area code 905 ZX Spectrum Cable television NSA encryption systems CompuServe Radio Filling station Universal Mobile Telecommunications System IPod Octopus card IP address Network effect Dialer Bay Area Rapid Transit Microeconomics Electronic Numbering

is it true people with scanners can hear you on a cordless phone someone told me that cordless phones aren't good to talk on because people with scanners can hear your private conversations is this true are there any cordless phones that are safe what about cell phones can a scanner hear you on your cell phone too i will expand on the answer given by silence above early cordless phones used analog signals on the mhz band and could easily be intercepted by most scanning receivers and by some baby monitors that shared the same frequencies a little later cordless phones came out that were on the mhz band but still used analog signals a more expensive type of scanning receiver was required to listen to this band but it could still be done most newer cordless phones use digital signals and operate on much higher freqency bands the digital signal must be decoded in order to be listened to and this is beyond the capabilities of the average person while it would be possible for a highly skilled person to intercept your call the chances of this happening are remote early cellular phones were also analog and could also be listened to using a scanning receiver but it was much more difficult as cell signals are constantly switching between towers you could listen to pieces of different conversations but it was difficult to stay with any one conversation and trying to listen to a specific person was nearly impossible to prevent people from listening to cell phones congress passed a law saying that scanning receivers had to be blocked so that they couldn't listen to cell frequencies the problem with this law was that thousands of unblocked receivers were already in use and that most blocked receivers could easily be unblocked by simply changing some wiring the good news is that all of the newer cell phones are now digital and like digital cordless phones can't be listened to by the average person there are still some analog cell phones in use mostly in very rural areas but effective february of these will be discontinued so in the case of both the cordless phone and the cell phone unless you are using very old equipment you can be fairly sure that it cannot be listened to by the average person with a scanner  Cellular network Mobile phone Cordless telephone Scanner (radio) Bluetooth Radio Telephone tapping Voice over IP Modem Wi-Fi Digital photography Ultra high frequency Television Covert listening device Computer virus Nordic Mobile Telephone Code division multiple access Telephone numbering plan Surveillance Amateur radio Telephone exchange Hearing aid Global Positioning System Loudspeaker Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Oscilloscope Phreaking Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting IEEE 802.11 Call for help MP3 North American Numbering Plan Digital audio broadcasting Shortwave Digital Subscriber Line Digital circuit AM broadcasting Global System for Mobile Communications Central processing unit Citizens' band radio Audiophile Digital Digital Visual Interface Gramophone record Radar RFID NTSC Cable television Social rule Broadband Internet access S__CAM Analog-to-digital converter Mobile phone radiation and health Barcode reader Electronic amplifier Advanced Mobile Phone System Circuit design Software-defined radio Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Musical Instrument Digital Interface Phase-locked loop Air traffic control IS-95 Integrated Services Digital Network Communications satellite National Weather Service High-definition television Nickel-cadmium battery Radio clock Password BlackBerry Digital television Transistor Avalanche Computed tomography VHF omnidirectional range Compact disc Walkman Advanced Audio Coding Secure Digital card Diode Low-pass filter Movie projector Federal Standard 1037C Sudoku Morse Code Digital AMPS Headphones Digital-to-analog converter SETI Solar cell

make a rotary phone dial i have a rotary phone from the 's 's i adapted it so that it would accept calls and it has full voice mine and theirs my problem is that it was used an extention phone so that you just talk and no dialing was used so i cant dial any numbers just talk if someone is already on the line or calls me when i opened her up i noticed the wires from tthe dialer were disconnected so all i need is to know where they need to be plugged in or atleast a clue to what it might look like ex the green cord goes in slot a any clues would be appreciated thanks http www porticus org bell images networks dsc jpg thats a pic of a board similar to the one in the phone so where on the board do all the dialing wires need to be plugged into been a long time since i dug into one of those but i can give you the basic principle and maybe you can get it working first i would suggest that before you change any wiring around that you make a diagram of the current wiring so you can at least get it back the way it was rotary pulse dialing works by briefly interrupting the telephone circuit if you examing the rotary dial you will find that there are a couple sets of switch contacts likely enclosed in a cover these would appear to be long thin metal strips that touch each other there will be at least two pairs of these contacts with the dial in the normal resting position you will find one set of contacts touching called normally closed and another set where the contacts are not touching normally open any time that the dial is not in the resting position the normally open contacts will be closed the wires from these contacts will be connected to the wires from the earpiece most likely two white wires the function of these contacts is to short out the earpiece while you are dialing so that you dont have a really loud clicking sound in your ear you dont need this to make it work but it does save your hearing the normally closed contacts are operated by a cam and will briefly open and close again as the dial is rotating by itself back to the resting position if you turn the dial to and release it this set of contacts will open and close times that it how it signals to the phone company what number you are dialing dial a and it sends pulses the wires from the normally closed contacts need to interrupt the connection between the phone and the line coming into the phone you need to located the wires coming from the wall into the phone they will go to a terminal block or network and are normally a red and a green wire ignore black and yellow remove one of the wires either the red or green doesnt matter from the terminal block and connect one of the wires from the normally closed contact to the terminal block in its place then connect end of the red or green wire that you removed from the terminal block to the other wire from the normally closed contact when the dial is at the resting position it will restore the connection and the phone will work turn the dial and release it should pulse the line and you should be able to call someone  Switch Modem Telephone Dual-tone multi-frequency Transformer Phreaking Jack plug Telephone numbering plan GSM services Enigma machine Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Rotary dial Predictive dialer Voice over IP Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Telegraphy Digital Subscriber Line Television UK telephone numbering plan Electric motor Mobile phone Microphone Potentiometer Overhead lines Circuit design Integrated Services Digital Network Headphones Apollo Guidance Computer Residual-current device Emergency telephone number Vertical service code Action potential Relay Telephone switchboard Private branch exchange IPod 9-1-1 Antenna (radio) Oscilloscope ITU-T Federal Standard 1037C North American Numbering Plan Diode Morse Code Ethernet Gas metal arc welding Drill bit BS 1363 TGV Volleyball Spark plug Spyware Dial Stargate (device) Transistor Tesla coil Digital circuit Teleprinter Bluetooth Telephone tapping Musical Instrument Digital Interface Call for help Seismometer Caller ID Burglar alarm X10 (industry standard) Impedance matching Electronic amplifier Dialer Stepping switch Time-division multiplexing Snooker Public Switched Telephone Network Fuse (electrical) Capacitor Phone fraud Distribution board NorthwesTel Rail terminology Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Telephone number Embedded system Circuit breaker Hayes command set Session Initiation Protocol Escapement VHF omnidirectional range Almon Strowger Commodore 64 Hearing aid Central processing unit Crossbar switch Wi-Fi Copy protection

how to join two phone calls how do you join two separate phone calls that have already started i was talking to a friend of mine when another good friend beeped in is there any way i can connect the two i want to be able to talk to both at the same time any help if you are subscribed to your telco's call waiting conferencing service and your phone can support it then for sure you can join the second caller into the conversation firstly dig out the service manual for your phone to see if it supports phone conferencing if you don't have one check the phone itself there may be a button labeled 'conference' or 'call waiting' somewhere near the touchpad you may also have to dig around the program menu for your phone if it's digital to see if you can find a menu that indicates that the phone supports call waiting conferencing if you're phone can't support conference calls then there's no point subscribing to your telco's service for this until you get a replacement phone otherwise you may call your telco and ask them what they charge for the service my best guess would be about and this may include other feature such as call id cid and voice mail  GSM services Telephone Vertical service code Integrated Services Digital Network Telephone numbering plan North American Numbering Plan Private branch exchange UK telephone numbering plan Telephone exchange Gmail Virgin Mobile Bluetooth IP Multimedia Subsystem MSN Messenger Network Switching Subsystem Telephone number Telephone company Telephone call BlackBerry Danger Hiptop Taxicab Phreaking Mac OS X v10.4 Windows Mobile Teletext Telephone booth Global System for Mobile Communications Skype IPod 9-1-1 Broadband Internet access Short message service Instant messaging Podcasting Asynchronous Transfer Mode Digital Subscriber Line Internet Conference call Verizon Wireless Public Switched Telephone Network Embedded system Xbox 360 Mobile phone Toll-free telephone number Computer-supported collaboration US West (phone company) Collaborative software Push to talk Modem Object Desktop Enterprise content management Comparison of instant messengers ITunes Nintendo DS Telephone switchboard Internet service provider Musical Instrument Digital Interface FidoNet Mad Money Asterisk PBX Nordic Mobile Telephone Social rule Call centre Payphone Pocket PC Web conferencing Frame relay X Window System Domain Name System SaskTel VeriSign Digital camera Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Emacs Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting PlayStation Portable E-mail spam Windows 2000 Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act GPRS Core Network Emergency telephone number AT&T Enhanced 911 Common Unix Printing System Touchpad Mach kernel 555 telephone number Truck ISDN User Part I-mode Ron and Fez Oscilloscope Retronym Xbox Religious Society of Friends

what number do you dial to hear your home phone ringing one of the kids have lost one of our cordless phones there used to be a number you dialed in to get the home phone ringing i know is the one you dial to see who has last phoned up its just i forgotten the other number thanks ps i would use my mobile but there is no credit on it it's called a ring back test ringback is a test used by many phone companies to quickly determine whether or not a new phone line is working correctly and the phone number is routing properly typically it works by calling a ringback number and then hanging up often the ringback number plays a low frequency tone into the line to indicate that it's working at which point the technician flashes the line hangs up very briefly to indicate they want a ringback this makes the ringback play a higher tone to indicate it is working and then the technician hangs up the phone will then ring answering only with a tone if picked up the tone is added so that telephone subscribers will not be able to easily use the ringback system as an intercom to call other extensions of their own phone line by simply initiating a ringback test and waiting for the phone to stop ringing so as to know when the other person has answered  Phreaking Telephone exchange Telephone GSM services Vertical service code Modem UK telephone numbering plan North American Numbering Plan Dual-tone multi-frequency 9-1-1 Telephone numbering plan Session Initiation Protocol Caller ID Blue box Emergency telephone number Telephone number Dial tone Telephone tapping Telephone call Automatic number announcement circuit Cordless telephone Bluetooth Telephone switchboard Toll-free telephone number Taxicab Mobile phone Rotary dial Digital Subscriber Line Call for help Ring tone Dial Skype Argentine telephone numbering plan Dial M for Murder NorthwesTel Key telephone system Cellular network Embedded system Integrated Services Digital Network Password Federal Standard 1037C Musical Instrument Digital Interface Intelligent network Violin Crossbar switch Call centre International Phonetic Alphabet IP Multimedia Subsystem Payphone 1-1-1 Global System for Mobile Communications Amateur radio Decibel Morse Code Autovon Radiotelephone Broadband Internet access Antenna (radio) 555 telephone number Trapped in the Closet Avalanche Microphone FidoNet Data retention Short message service Double bass Phone sex Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications Automatic number identification WiMAX IS-95 Sound design Hearing impairment Weighing scale VHF omnidirectional range Burglar alarm Radio Donald Neilson Beatmania IIDX Konica Minolta Phoneme Speech synthesis Oscilloscope Telephone booth Enhanced 911 Quiz Call Nordic Mobile Telephone Tag Cable television Timeline of the telephone Gmail Electric motor Public Switched Telephone Network Winning Streak Harmonic series (music)

getting vonage voip service do i need to buy a special phone no vonage will provide a special router telephone adapter that connects to your broadband connection cable or dsl most likely and provides a couple of ethernet connections for your computer network and provides one or two lines of dial tone phone service depending on what you purchased from vonage you just plug one or all of your regular phones into this jack if you prefer you can just connectorize a single wire going to all your phones into kind of a 'demarc' to get all your phones on one pair of wire for convenience one suggestion though you might find that the performance of your phone service is better if you don't connect other network devices that use your internet connection ahead of the vonge router if you connect your computer s to the vonage router it can respond to your performance preferences and throttle data service to the computer when needed to ensure that your phone service always takes priority i have done this and it works pretty well one other tip on the vonage web site you can set up a forwarding number in the event that there is a service outage if you do this in the event your internet service drops for a couple of minutes you still won't lose any calls assuming you have a cell phone or alternate phone number i don't think mine goes down very often but it has a few times and it's good to get the phone call anyway hope this helps i hope you enjoy vonage i found that for the money it's really a pretty good service not perfect but certainly worth the money  Digital Subscriber Line Telephone 9-1-1 Telephone exchange Router Ethernet Asynchronous Transfer Mode Bluetooth Wi-Fi Broadband Internet access Private branch exchange Universal Serial Bus Password HomePNA Enhanced 911 Integrated Services Digital Network Internet Phreaking Power line communication Telephone numbering plan Cisco Systems AppleTalk Session Initiation Protocol Embedded system Cable television Wireless LAN Skype Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol General Packet Radio Service Network address translation WiMAX TIA-568A/B Musical Instrument Digital Interface Denial-of-service attack Internet service provider Telephone tapping Surveillance Telegraphy Internet Group Management Protocol Mobile phone Jack plug Computer bus Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Emergency telephone number AT&T Cable modem Eircom IP Multimedia Subsystem NSA encryption systems Xbox Internet protocol suite Poker jargon IPv6 Communications protocol UK telephone numbering plan Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Public Switched Telephone Network IPod Multiprotocol Label Switching FidoNet Computer Transmission Control Protocol Telephone call IiNet Dual-tone multi-frequency Frame relay PDP-11 FireWire Internet fraud Differentiated services Nintendo DS Quality of service Dialer Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Satellite internet IEEE 802.11 Hash table Triple play (telecommunications) ITU-T Computer network Yahoo!

telephone wiring question there are four wires in the junction box red green yellow and black the yellow and blackwires aren't connected to anything so what are they there for the red and green wires are the ones used for the phone signal in the old days the yellow and black wires were sometimes used to power the light in the phone's dial they also did something with the yellow wire when you had a party line line that was shared with other users now days the yellow and black wires are spares and can be used if you want a second line edited in response to joe r you are correct in that the older telephones used a drop cable that had only one pair this would have been connected to the red green pair of the quad station wiring that went to the phones however if the phones being used had dial lamps a plug in transformer would have been installed somewhere in the house and connected to the yellow black pair of the station wiring this was used to power the lamps i believe that some party line arrangements also required that the yellow be connected to earth ground the ground rod outside the house  Telephone exchange Telephone tapping Telephone Digital Subscriber Line Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Modem Key telephone system Railway signal Enigma machine Private branch exchange Antenna (radio) Ground (electricity) Electrical wiring (UK) TIA-568A/B Universal Serial Bus Railway signalling Television Voice over IP 9-1-1 Jack plug High-voltage direct current Broadband Internet access Three-phase electric power Burglar alarm Telephone numbering plan Split phase Telephone switchboard Alternating current Bluetooth Overhead lines Electricity meter Electrical wiring Ethernet Traffic light Electricity distribution Light-emitting diode Integrated Services Digital Network Wi-Fi Telegraphy Sundial Residual-current device Fuse (electrical) Color UK telephone numbering plan BS 1363 25-pair color code Mobile phone Rapid transit Lineman (occupation) Musical Instrument Digital Interface Telephone call X10 (industry standard) Oscilloscope Call for help Xbox Electricity pylon Seismometer Cable television Overhead powerline Diode Automotive lighting Elis Prefecture Dual-tone multi-frequency Electric power transmission SCART Cellular network Transistor Vertical service code Light rail Coaxial cable Relay Category 5 cable Dial CityRail Caller ID Wardenclyffe Tower Blue box Phone fraud Communications satellite Emergency telephone number North American Numbering Plan Solar cell WiMAX Public Switched Telephone Network Lightsaber Vacuum tube Nonblocking minimal spanning switch GSM services Crossbar switch Telephone number Transformer Rotary dial
