conformation i saw someone else do this a while back and i thought i might give it a go i myself don't have much of an eye for judging conformation but i'm sure many of you on answers can tell me right off the bat what's off on my horse so here's some photos and please tell me what faults you can see in ol' dakota's conformation judging by these http www flickr com photos samurai lullaby http www flickr com photos samurai lullaby i'm sure he's got plenty and i can be assured that his bad points outweigh his good xd lol he's nothing special as far as horses go thanks in advance everyone yup he's a fatty xd i have him on feed supposed to aid in weight management we'll see how it goes he gains weight very easily agreed bama i haven't been riding him as much as i should these past few weeks as my tractor has broken down and shredding is therefore impossible my area is rattlesnake city so going for a long ride in overgrown pasture is not exactly safe i've been lunging him however but that still doesn't seem enough to get that fat belly of his to go down and yes as you guessed a gelding please toni no need to be kind xd i've put him on the chopping block i'm asking for it lol mostly i just want to know if there is anything severe other than weight that i need to watch out for hmm i don't believe he has cushing's he doesn't show any signs not sore or sluggish no heat in the hooves sheds his coat out fine no curly coat doesn't eat drink or pee excessively i have him get regular vet checks and he always checks out fine the vet also mentioned that he needs to lose weight but said nothing else thanks for the concern perhaps i'll mention it specifically to the vet next time first of all he need to slim down a bit he is a good looking horse but this is what i came up with first of all his neck and throatlatch is really thick and ties is too low on his shoulder i would like to see a shoulder that is more angulated as well as his hip they both should be at a degree angle and if you were to draw a straight line on the angle of his shoulder and the angle to his hip it should meet over his back to form a degree angle i also would like to see a deeper girth from the top of his whithers to the bottom of his girth and from the bottom of his girth to the ground should be the same length his hip is a little short to because from the point of his shoulder to his withers should be the same as the length of his barrel and his hip and his his is a little too short he has a nice strong back and loins his pasterns are at a nice slope and his front legs look awesome when it come to structure short cannons and he's very straight his hind legs are good too but i would like to see him stand with his hind legs more under himself and he looks like he is camped out a little but it could be just the way he's standing too i do like his head very much as it gives him a nice masculine look overall he is a very nice looking horse and is a pretty color too have fun  Horse Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling holds Aerial (dance move) Knife Poker jargon Horse gait Theory of conduct Weight training Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Fancy rat Swingout Glossary of climbing terms Professional wrestling attacks Boxing Drill bit Volleyball Dressage Suplex Guinea pig Diving Evolution of the Horse Powerbomb Sin City Wood carving Skateboarding trick RuneScape quests Softball Anchor Strap-on dildo Tank Diving suit Vegeta Chair The Shining (film) Breaststroke Swimming Dragon Booster Garfield Casualty lifting Hair Little Britain Cat Chess strategy and tactics Physical attractiveness Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Mattress Double bass Tetrapod Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hip fracture Table tennis Arabian horse Mnemonic P-61 Black Widow Norway national football team Bicycle frame Dog agility Appaloosa Recumbent bicycle New York Giants Backstroke Professional wrestling aerial techniques Piccolo Junior Saga Shaggy dog story Muay Thai Seabiscuit Glossary of nautical terms Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Show hunter Wood Milton H.

how hard is it to break a horse in i just got a horse and now i have a trainer i aws wondering how hard it is to break a horse just to ride not for competitions the simple answer is it depends on the horse just as in children no two horses are the same it could take two months or two years you never know it also depends on how you decide to train your horse the traditional method of breaking a horse in or breaking a horses spirit is today not widely regarded as an acceptable or efficient way of training you are more likely to have more success with soft handling such as parrelli's natural horsemanship or monty robert's join up technique there are many different ways to soft handle a horse it depends on the trainer you use but it is important that you and your horse are comfortable with the training methods used  Horse breaking Aikido Horse Martial art Cowboy Dog agility Seabiscuit Arabian horse Anchor Dog training Equine conformation Dressage Cavalry Karate Car handling Snowboard Strap-on dildo Chinese martial arts Mixed martial arts Alexander Technique Species Naval mine Japan Cup Technology Cross-country skiing Stage lighting Tai Chi Chuan Thoroughbred horse race The Book of Five Rings Boxing training Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Eventing Mattress Archery Horseshoe Bicycle frame Software engineering Makybe Diva Consensus decision-making Breaker Morant Volleyball Domestic rabbit Mathematics Floppy disk Labour economics Gliding Sumo John Wesley Weight training Sword making Expert system Horse gait Scientology beliefs and practices Uzumaki Naruto Tooth enamel Third English Civil War Muay Thai Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Comanche The nature of God in Western theology Circus Horse racing Tire Military advances of Genghis Khan Stomach cancer CPU cache Santa Claus Synthetic diamond Northerly Welding Pony Neil Young Bookbinding Stuttering Sailing Master of the Horse Lucien Laurin Motorcycle helmet Melbourne Cup Drill bit Highland games Wood carving Tonality Web crawler Genetic algorithm MP3 Ulic Qel-Droma Domestication of the horse Taoism Shinto Thoroughbred Rod Stewart Charles, Prince of Wales Password Hitchhiking Commodity markets Extreme Programming Train Gambling Object-oriented programming

how can you teach a horse to ground tie i want to teach my appaloosa gelding to ground tie anyone have an idea how too if i drop the reins on the ground and say stand he stays untill i walk then he follows me anyone have a previous ground tie training experience good question ground tying is very useful in many applications but it requires a lot of patience and time to teach first unless your horse has been taught to give to pressure with the bit i caution against dropping the reins on the ground if he steps on his reins and pulls his mouth you may end up with a host of other problems that said giving to pressure is the first step you can start with a halter or start with a snaffle or mild bit hold pressure on the rein or on the lead rope until he moves his head willingly towards the pressure you may have to lock your hand so that if he pulls you are immovable as soon as he gives to your pressure give him slack and praise him practice this and remember that release of pressure on his mouth and head is the best kind of praise immediate release of pressure is the key to getting him to learn this once you have him giving consistently and softly on both sides to pressure on his head you can start attempting to ground tie him the point is to start slow and small practice somewhere quiet where his attention can be on you i'd start with a halter drop the lead on the ground use a soft cotton one that won't cause rope burns should he get tangled and boot him for extra protection pat him and tell him good he won't get what you're about for a while so many many reptitions are the key walk him stop him drop the rope praise him after some repitition of this when you drop the rope take one step away then praise him move back to him pick up the rope and walk somewhere else repeat eventually start to take two steps when you drop the rope praise him move back pick up the rope continue on should he move his feet when you walk away return to him and place him back in the same position he was in don't scold him or reprimand him and do not praise him until he is back where he is supposed to be keep working until you can take five or ten steps from him without him moving after you eventually it will occur to him that when you stop and drop the rope he is to stand until you return and pick up the rope the repetition will drive home the message another key don't burn him out on it you don't have to teach him in one day horses learn in a wave pattern so he might seem like he has forgotten it from one day to the next reteach him and move on his learning downs will get shorter and shorter you can teach it in many shorter lessons but many is the key if he seems like he is getting burnt out give him a break and let him think about something else best wishes and happy trails  Equine conformation Horse Horse tack Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling holds Dog training Professional wrestling aerial techniques Glossary of American football Professional wrestling attacks Milton H.

how do you fill out a horse hip bone area my horse who was a saved horse is having problems filling out in her hip bones she looks great in the stomach legs etc but her hip bones butt area just stick out how do you get this area to fill out first you need to make sure that she is meeting her daily nutritional requirements and is allowed to graze on high quality grass at least two hours a day the longer the better also you need to consider switching her to a higher quality feed if she is years or older i strongly suggest purina s senior feed this feed concentrates on the problem areas that are typical of most older horses back point of shoulder and hips if grass is scarce then you might want to add two flakes of hay that have a higher amount of protein such as alfalfa combined with costal etc what you have described to me are called rafter hips rafter hips are caused by a lack of muscling so combined with better nutrition you need to increase the amount daily exercise your horse is getting it is crucial that you keep increasing the physical demand and also the difficulty of your lessons while still remaining appropriate to age ability and skill level before and after each exercise you need to record your horses pulse number of heartbeats in a minute respiratory how many breaths your horse takes in a minute rate and your horses recovery rate how long it takes your horses breathing and pulse to return to normal after exercise this is important in judging your horses fitness level and knowing how and when to increase the amount of exercise that being said it is time to focus on the quality of work your horse is getting for this the best thing will be to ride under a knowledgeable horse person or qualified riding instructor i say this because you will need to learn how to get your horse to engage his hindquarters and use her muscles correctly thus building well developed muscles in the rear end here are the nine steps in which you will need to complete in order to help your horse build muscle through his hindquarters back stomach and neck for more information on these steps the difference between correct and incorrect and how to do it see the pony club manuals d a also be sure to check out lessons with lendon by lendon gray the nine steps are calmness relaxation and confidence regular gaits with true rhythm and steady working tempo free forward movement contact on the aids and on the bit straightness improvement of balance and suppleness lateral work impulsion collection self carriage roundness and lightness along with consistency you may also consider doing raised cavelletti cavelletti is about poles raised anywhere from to off the ground and spaced out depending on how large your horses stride is cavelletti is used to help the horse use his hind end to thrust him forward using those booty muscles cavelletti can be placed at different part of the arena ridden at a walk trot and canter note you will need to adjust the spacing of the cavetti depending on the gait and the size of your horse s stride cavelletti can also be used when longing here is a picture to give you an idea of what cavelletti are and how it is used img http i photobucket com albums z xxwendythegreatx horse jump jpg img i would recommend that you use cavelletti periodically once every other week should be sufficient in addition to cavelletti gymnastic jumping will also be beneficial this should be done no more than once a week gymnastic jumping are series of fences low is fine that are set at a distance that challenges your horse s coordination balance and strength whenever you are jumping you need to be riding under an experienced trainer and someone who knows and understands the correct distances and level of difficulty for both you and your horse don t forget your helmet here is a picture to give you an example of what a gymnastics grid looks like a href http photobucket com target blank img src http i photobucket com albums z xxwendythegreatx horse jump jpg border alt photo sharing and video hosting at photobucket a if you are a western rider don t worry gymnastic jumping is not necessary instead you can go on a small hack and walk up and down hills once your horse is fit you can try trotting up hills and walking down you need to remember that you will not get results overnight conditioning a horse and building muscle take time and it needs to be done carefully also the amount of exercise the age and weight of your horse need to be coherent with the amount and type of food your horse is eating once your horse starts to get into shape not only will she be more muscular but be more physically and emotionally sound stress free is the way to be here are some books that will really help you with your problem the united states pony club manuals of horsemanship levels d a by susan e harris lessons with lendon by lendon gray don t shoot the dog by karen pryor dressage exercises by jec aristotle the ultimate horse behavior and training book by linda tellington jones i hope i was able to help let me know if you have any mores questions on how to do something or why we do it or if you need any more help

what is road hack i've never heard of it until yesterday and i was wondering what it was and how it's judged i was helping out at a higher end show yesterday and road hack was one of the classes so it is judged road hack is a flat class frequently entered by arabs saddlebreds and nat'l show horses however some shows run it as an open english division class and you will see hunt seat horses as well its run typically as a walk trot canter both ways of the ring the difference is that they add an extended trot and a hand gallop for safety reasons they may split the class and canter and hand gallop in sections they are looking for a true extention of both the trot and the canter suitability and how pleasureable the ride looks counts  Horse gait Horse Equitation Hunt seat Dressage Tennessee Walker Show hunter Equine conformation Horse tack American Saddlebred Obedience training Eventing Show jumping Cross-country equestrianism Trot (horse gait) Milton H.

what do you think go to http www youtube com watch v cvfe ircvng please comment your leg position looks fine you need to maintain contact on the reins they are a bit too long and your horse is rushing the jumps instead if being collected also instead of shortening your reins to control the rushing you are leaning back in the saddle to slow the horse sit up straight and shorten your reins close your leg on your horse and push him into your hands for better collection and control practice this without jumps first to get the feel then try ground poles before moving up to jumps again your horse will need a couple of weeks riding like this before jumping again to strengthen the muscles he will be using for greater collection good luck  Equine conformation Horse Horse gait Swingout Dressage Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling throws Show hunter Professional wrestling holds Dog agility Show jumping Professional wrestling aerial techniques Equitation Pole vault Cowboy Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Seabiscuit Diving Ayrton Senna Powerbomb Milton H.

after qs how long will it for a horse's back to heal i hope you have read the previous two questions about mystic the stocky paint mare that refuses to trot while being independently ridden well i'm pretty sure the answer is her saddle as most people have said what i see that how it doesn't fit is that the tree is too narrow and the back also needs stuffing she is a wide horse she basically would be a quarter horse since she doesn't have any natural spots just a white spot on her butt that's a scar from when she was a foal and got stuck in a fence or something just a abnormal blaze and three socks well anyway if her back is the problem that the english saddle is pinching her then how long do you think it would take to heal and what could we personally do for her even after the chiropractor is out here's some pictures and videos that are kind of old but yeah this is from the beginning of june http i photobucket com albums h appaloosalover pmf and shows hillcrest stables mystic jpg http i photobucket com albums h appaloosalover pmf and shows hillcrest stables mystic jpg http i photobucket com albums h appaloosalover pmf and shows hillcrest stables mystic jpg http i photobucket com albums h appaloosalover pmf and shows hillcrest stables mystic jpg that's me riding bareback see how she is reacting to the left side i think it hurts more there here's my friend riding canter trot in may when she actually would trot http youtube com watch v y vzosctlw http youtube com watch v nxfsdod hfa remember that in the videos this horse does not know a thing about contact she is a western horse and we are retraining her to english that's mainly why she is evading contact those videos are also old mind you that's when we were first starting her out depending on how much damage and soreness to the horse i would back up the chiro with accupuncture when i totally obliterated my mules back unknowingly the saddle fitters were not versed in mules he had mths off with solid accupressure no one did accupuncture at that time and chiro work i had walked him and trotted him to keep him in shape but no weight i would of drove him however but this was prior to his driving training go with how your horse is doing ask the opinion of the chiro healing comes faster with accupuncture and chiro together trust me i just had it done on my mule for a pinched nerve in his shoulder he was usuable a week later it was amazing edit how does this horse move then as a western where is her headset this horse needs to be taught to bend at the pole and i have a suspicion that her head isn't doing that at western also something is bothering this horse whether it be saddle or lack of training on the bit but definately i would have someone check her for soreness which you can do by running your fingers down their back on both sides of the spine etc however sometimes pain masks in other areas like hips and neck too shes a pretty horse tho  Horse tack Seabiscuit Professional wrestling holds Dressage Milton H.

what are the legal requirements for a vehicle being used to pull a trailer carrying horses i remember it used to be that as long as the vehicle was powerful enough it could be anything i e a family saloon could be used but a few years ago i remember this changed can anyone clarify please sorry i should have said that i'm in the uk i remember something happening a few years back regarding a change because i remember people complaining that they would not be able to use their saloon cars any longer to take their horses to shows in a trailer that they would have to get a x or a lorry and you never see saloons and trailers at shows anymore simply you can't tow a load that is heavier than the towing vehicle unless you have wheel drive it's a bit more complex than that but in effect that means no saloons because any trailer with a horse in it weighs more than any wheel drive vehicle i know unless you have a transit van maybe remember that it's not pulling it thats the problem it's stopping it  Semi-trailer Driver's license Pickup truck Truck Rear wheel drive Tractor Van (road vehicle) Sport utility vehicle German car number plates Trailer (vehicle) Autorack Recreational vehicle Peugeot Train Tire Steering Road Tank classification Manual transmission British Carriage and Wagon Numbering and Classification Vehicular cycling Travel trailer Four wheel drive Front wheel drive Axle Battery electric vehicle Car handling Automobile Land Rover (Series/Defender) Gliding Mobile home T-34 Traffic light Spacecraft propulsion Transportation of Los Angeles Tram Transmission (mechanics) Horsepower Personal rapid transit Firearm Toronto Streetcar System Horse tack Dump truck Car body style Ferry Speed limit Hybrid vehicle Electronic toll collection Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority Freeway Road traffic accident Wayne Corporation Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Honda Pilot MIM-23 Hawk Stryker Cable car (railway) Tamiya Corporation Motorcycle Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) Shipping 88 mm gun Intermodal freight transport Car safety Volkswagen Type 2 Cart Rules of the road All-terrain vehicle Armoured warfare Locomotive Passenger car Iowa class battleship Wheel of Fortune Auto Train (Amtrak) Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas British Rail Derby Lightweight M4 Sherman Toyota Celica Equine conformation Station wagon Manifold vacuum Vauxhall Viva Peugeot 405 Bicycle Straight-6 Recumbent bicycle Minnesota Transportation Museum Drag racing Disneyland School bus Formula One regulations Cowboy Dredge Light rail Car classification Supercharger Channel Tunnel US and Canadian license plates Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends

riding instructor is a riding instructor a good career i dont mean working in a riding school i mean as private one on one teaching where people call and you go to their yard to give them a lesson a few people have said its a rewarding thing to do but im not sure if it would be enough money to live on i know it depends how much business you have but i was just wondering what peoples oppinions are thanks it's a pretty goo job as long as you can earn enough money by having enough customers the best thing is probably to start at a riding school because than there is a set amount that you know you will be getting since there are already customers there who you could teach and it would probably be easier at first since you don't have to worry about finding customers if you do start out at a riding school you should tell them that you don't know how long you will be there for and you are thinking that you will eventually move into a private practice  Graduate school Snowboarding Extreme Programming Public good Social rule Capitalism Current teachings of Prem Rawat Education in the United States Jon Secada Theory of conduct Citigroup Health insurance Insurance Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Dog training Sweatshop Milton H.

how do you get a horse to change leads my horse just turned four and i love her to death i have trained her myself and this fall and next summer im going to be entering her in events i want to barrel race her and it is key to have your horse on the write lead to go around the barrel im just not that sure how to make her change her lead i would like too know how to get her to change leads if we are just running in a straight line as well bah simple question no one will give you the correct answer because few horse people actually understand the mechanics of horses you will learn if you listen to my advice that gaming horses are perhaps the most physically tuned horses and by far the best competitors second only to reining horses first thing your horse is too young to be asked for speed when you show next year you should ask for correctness speed will follow it is absolutely key to have your horse on the right lead around a barrel how does one accomplish this well anyone with any brains should know that all leads come from the hip this is why ex reiners make fantastic barrel horses because they have stellar hip movement teaching your horse to move her hip is the basis of barrel racing if you ride a horse with a solid hip it will not drop shoudler it will properly change leads it will not run off a horse with a hip will run correctly consistently and competitively horses with hips learn to curve around barrels with their shoulders lifted not to mention you will blow people away with your amazing ability to cue flying lead changes every two strides okay sounds great how do we acheive hip because your mare is young you have it easy to be most effective you will need a round pen and some ball spurs if you are new to training horses go out and buy a book on reining to learn about the proper way to work a hip begin by doing ground work stand next to you mare and press into her hip with your hand when she steps away from the pressure that is her reward this will teach her to move off her hip go both ways with your goal being to keep her moving off the pressure while her front feet are planted try to complete a circle each way when you are very confident in her movement saddle up and ride in the round pen use the same pressure technique with your spur press into her left hip while slightly tipping her head to the left be sure to keep your right leg off her body if she does not respond cluck to her and tap the left spur when she steps even if its small reward her with a release of pressure continue these steps until you can cue her to make full hip turns in both directions working the hip takes patience and it can be challenging for both horse and rider but the benefits are endless once a horse learns to move its hip the horse becomes lifted allowing it to spring out of barrel turns and stay lifted in the shoulder eventually you should be able to cue your horse to canter by simply sliding your leg back and putting slight pressure on her hip helpful hints to know you're on the right track when you canter a straight line the inside hip should be tipped in if you can see your horse's inside hip tipped into the center of the arena you are moving it correctly second your horse should build up a muscle on both sides of her lower belly it will look like a straight line from her ribs to hip with a slightly upward tilt this is a sign that your mare is lifting herself up when she canters what does this have to do with barrels everything your horse will run like a dream once she has her hip but you still need to spend your show season running to be correct practice really cueing that lead switch coming out of your first barrel which is the only time a switch is required here is my favorite barrel racing drill when you get to the point where you can lope in not run lope practice the switch by working the hip here is a simple drill that you can practice that will keep your horses from getting sour while still stressing the important factors in running a pattern practice this drill at a walk or trot until you are certain your horse can do it during a controlled lope not a run i use it with my mare all the time basically you set up the regular pattern but when you approach the barrel you stop and rate back up a step or two and get your mare's hip this means you pressure with the outside leg until she swings her hip towards the barrel then circle the barrel twice being certain to keep your horse's inside eye watching the barrel while your outside leg is tapping your horse s outside hip keep your pockets about three to five feet away from the barrel and make sure they are round then after circling twice move on to the next barrel and repeat when you come off of your third barrel don't ride the straight away like you would in a show instead finish your horse's pocket by completely closing it and riding off in a line perpendicular to the straight away lots of information but it's worth it if you need extra

can miniature ponys be kept in the house i've heard about people keeping miniature ponys in their house just like dogs let them sleep on their bed etc and i know they can be used for blind people instead of seeing eye dogs is it really a good idea to keep a miniature pony inside even if it gets adequate time and exercise outdoors if so can they be potty trained like dogs so they don't mess in the house how pricey are they how much money should be expected to be spent on food etc i sincerely hope that you are not considering keeping a miniature horse in your house miniature horses are used as service animals as someone already said but usually for epileptics or disabled individuals not blind people because they spook too easily and attract too much attention i have trained horses to poo in a muck bucket in the corner of their stall but as horses are hind gut digesters and are constantly digesting food you cannot house train them or keep them from pooing as that could easily constipate them and cause colic by impaction they do make horsey diapers but that is ridiculous as to your inquiry as to their cost minis can range from free to several hundred dollars to over for a show quality pet on average expect to pay between and they do not eat much and are often over fed a bag of grain between and will last months and a bale of hay averages like and will last about a week and a half vet bills will average at least a year don't forget hoof trims and wormers and grooming supplies and such you will need to build a shelter and fence in your yard if you are considering getting a mini  Cat Horse Dog Hamster Toilet humour Guinea pig Poker jargon Pet skunk Dairy Livestock Equine conformation Social rule Laminitis My Little Pony Fancy rat Dog training Housebreaking Shaggy dog story Ferret Fecal incontinence Horse colic Shetland Sheepdog House Mouse Rabbit Hunting Public transport Comanche Fox hunting Horseshoe Hay Microchip implant (animal) Milk Ben Johnson (athlete) Community emergency response team Horse gait Gray Wolf Economy of Russia Socialization Arabian horse Homer Simpson Urinary incontinence Taboo food and drink Milton H.

are miniature horses good pets and are they all mean i have plenty of space and already own two large ponies is it ok to put a mini horse with horses and i have herd that they can be mean are they and if i decide to buy one what web sites could i go to look for one i agree with barbara s any horse of any size becomes mean because of how it is treated many minis get the stigma of mean devil ponies because people coddle them since their cute and then they get away with murder they can also get defensive in a herd or larger horses as they are small and some times are bullied and feel inferior b c of their size others have no idea they are small and will dominate your entire herd they are perfectly suited companions to large horses and make great pets but they do need trained and disciplined like all pets you would not let your dog potty in the house or the cat ruin the furniture so the mini horse should not be allowed to bite push people or get away with misbehaving because he's cute if you train your mini and treat him like a horse should be treated loved like a pet and respected like a barnyard animal then you should have no problems you can try dreamhorse com and equine com to search for minis i have a colt for sale and also advertise my stallion there and i get lots of calls so you are bound to find something there good luck  Horse Domestication of the horse Hamster Dog Equine conformation Pony Zoophilia Marguerite Henry My Little Pony Cat Horseshoe Ferret Working dog Spanking Neopets Kodocha Mini Pet Shetland Sheepdog Petplay The Red Pony Fancy rat Dairy Working animal Domestic rabbit Housebreaking Pet skunk Border Collie Livestock MapleStory Arabian horse Upholstery M16 (rifle) Dog training Guinea pig RISC Evolution of the Horse American Bison Brown Bear Donkey Social rule Friends German Shepherd Dog Horse breaking Internet phenomenon Betting (poker) Dressage Selective breeding Sinfest Companion dog Poodle The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Thoroughbred Ranma __ characters IPod nano Cowboy Przewalski's Horse The Pet Sounds Sessions Azumanga Daioh Domestication Roan (color) Care Bears Pekingese Advertising Daredevil Pitaten Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Okashina Okashi Microchip implant (animal) Garfield Connemara pony Wombat Kylie Minogue W.I.T.C.H.

how do you plant and harvest hay i have a grassy area which i would like plant hay in for some goats and or miniature horses is this feasible how does one go about planting and harvesting thank you if you have enough property it would be cheaper in the long run to talk to local farmers and do the share cropping thing believe me by the time you buy all the equipment you will be in the hole for years or so or just use the property for grazing your own live stock hope this helps  Livestock Palouse Deforestation Sharecropping Tobacco Agricultural machinery Dairy Combine harvester Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life Collectivisation in the USSR Agriculture Sorghum Desertification Green Revolution Peanut Biodiesel Hay Alfalfa Neolithic Local food Cereal Vermicompost Monoculture Crop rotation Wheat Weed control Market gardening Coffea Jute Agriculture in the United States Hop (plant) Hemp Warren Buffett Pampa Hydroponics Sugar beet Grand Teton National Park Coffea arabica Clover Alcohol fuel Enclosure Community-supported agriculture Monsanto Sustainable agriculture Banana Cotton Food Irrigation Economy of India Organic farming Chula Vista, California Case Corporation Environmental vegetarianism Rapeseed Domestic goat Oat CNH Global Organic food Common Agricultural Policy Rice Milk Narrow gauge Mutual fund Commodity markets Wildfire Huntsville, Alabama East Province, Cameroon Chinese calendar Neolithic Revolution Silage Ovambo Arizona Territory Pysanka Palmdale, California Mulch Global warming and agriculture Tlingit Agricultural policy Plant breeders' rights Potato Quang Ninh Province Yakima River Random Harvest Agriculture in Australia Lindsay, California Watermelon Fish farming John Hay Whitney Beverly Hills, California Essential oil Food security Derivative (finance) International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture Soil science Harvest moon Plantation Vicia faba

what are the chances what are the chances of my horse getting collic colic can be deadly although not contagious if you suspect your horse is colicing get a vet out now don't wait every minute is one of concern horses can't vomit and do not continue to feed or give them water even if they drink or eat their stomach will rupture some vets say walk the horse i would only walk the horse as an attempt to keep them from rolling if the horse is standing quietly let them horses rolling around can cause a bowel to flip and cause a blockage and this too could rupture ruptures need surgery immediately and sometime these are very costly and not always successful hope you are just asking out of curiosity about colic  Horse colic Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Vomiting Breastfeeding Stomach cancer Ferret Drowning Stroke Aerial (dance move) Ovarian cancer Horse Prostate cancer Myocardial infarction Laminitis Professional wrestling aerial techniques Cancer Diarrhea 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Kidney stone Fecal incontinence Veterinary medicine Bowel obstruction Hemorrhagic stroke Hypoglycemia Hemorrhoid Randomness Apollo 8 Jackass: The Movie Initiation: Silent Night, Deadly Night 4 Smallpox Rooibos Esophageal cancer Rod Stewart The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Charles Darwin's illness Sulfasalazine Comanche Gastroparesis Pneumonia Coronary heart disease Chemotherapy Bulimia nervosa Toilet humour The Isley Brothers Dehydration Triage Hirschsprung's disease Sin City Probability Skateboarding trick Poker jargon 2005 World Series Peptic ulcer Ovarian cyst Kommissar Rex Cholecystitis Endometriosis Hernia Sly & the Family Stone Treehouse of Horror V Social rule Cerebral aneurysm Acupuncture Milk Cramp Japanese tea ceremony Colorectal cancer Suicide methods Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Aortic dissection Paget's disease of bone Food allergy Ulcerative colitis Fancy rat Adjustable gastric band Tsunami Cleveland Browns The McGuire Sisters Shaggy dog story Docking Syphon Filter Professional wrestling holds Wyatt Earp Escherichia coli O157:H7 Zollinger-Ellison syndrome Vaccine Organ transplant Foot-and-mouth disease Brian Griffin Professional wrestling attacks Journey (band) Abdominal pain John Forrest, 1st Baron Forrest of Bunbury Pinball Sleep apnea Jon Secada Johnny Cash 2005 dengue outbreak in Singapore Inflammatory bowel disease Childbirth

which bridle my horse is really strong i am getting my new horse this week and have ridden him times so i know what he is like i will be getting a new bridle for him and at the moment he has a normal bridle i want more control over him but i don't want to hurt him by getting a stronger bit so i was think that maybe a pelham bridle might work the kind of work i would be doing is hard xc showjumping schooling lots of hacking etc or would a flash bridle work better or is there any other bridles you would reccomend thanks i fell into this trap with my jumper he would blast through my hands on course and it really unnerved me to say nothing about being dangerous when jumping at height he's a big boy hands of throughbred enthusiasm and i'm a tiny rider i thought the answer was a stronger bit to make him stop i worked with my trainer and we tried all sorts of combinations and rigs we'd see improvement but then he'd start blasting through the new bit it's a slippery slope i went into a clinic with greg best and he looked my horse over and said you might as well ride him in a snaffle because there is no bit on earth that will stop that horse i took it as a challenge and showed up for the second day of the clinic with a snaffle and a standing martingale you know what it worked it was a slow twist but it was just an eggbutt snaffle the difference was that we weren't fighting anymore i had to ride correctly since i couldn't just rely on more and more force my horse calmed down since he wasn't worried anymore was he still trying to take off of course but i had to learn to ride from my back and leg not yanking on his face it took an outsider's view to realize that we had gone way too far and that we needed to go back to the beginning just some advice form someone who's been there you sound a bit nervous about your new partner don't make any decisions on a bit until he's at home and settled keep him in the same rig until you get to know him very well keep your trainer close for those first couple of rides you're making an impression on your new partner as well so keep that in mind you don't want him to learn to be scared of your hands or learn that he can be naughty especially on the flat sounds like there some xc in there so i'm assuming you've got some dressage to do go in a snaffle if you can't do the flat in a snaffle there are other issues if you show in dressage at all you have to do it in a snaffle so there is no point in practicing in something stronger i do not recommend a pelham in your situation i use a pelham with both reins in the equitation ring since i need the extra control with my beast but i've been at this a very long time the pelham can be a very harsh bit it's very hard to learn to handle both reins and i've had a horse go over backwards in that set up what's your new friend going in now many horses go in more then one bit depending on what you're working on my beast goes in three different bits with some extras for mood swings and shows if you're worried about the cross country work and most horses get stronger out in the open i can recommend my favorite bit that has worked for several different horses i've had excellent results with a hollow mouth loose ring elevator specifically the three ring style i've found that most horses go well in this since it's a comfortable bit but you do have some brakes if you need it look for the myler version for a very nice feel for the horse put it on the main ring and it's just a bit more then a snaffle but be very careful if you are going to shift down to the lower rings don't forget the bit guards watch our for a horse learning to lean on this bit flash and drop nosebands are for a specific problem and if your horse is not opening it's mouth then i would say don't bother it's harder for the horse to breathe going cross country in that kind of a rig  Milton H.

does it matter which feet are shod i am getting a horse this week and i was wondering if it makes a difference which feet are shod front two back two all or none my horses feet are shod on the front two i was wondering if you should get all of them done if you want to do jumping better or what does having just the back ones make it easier to do dressage or something for example or are they just put on there for the sake of it i will be doing hard work on my new horse hacking out alot and alot of jumping xc and schooling lots of comps etc if i do this kind of work should i get all feet shod please help ask this question to anyone with horses and you will get a million and one different answers ask a million and one farriers and they too will give you a million and one different answers horses were born with what they need we the horse owners are responsible for making their feet so bad that they need shoes to protect them there are only a few reasons that any horse needs shoes reason one that the horse wears away more foot then it can grow which will lead to lameness reason two reining in which sliders will need to be placed on the horses hind feet to allow it to slide reason three professional barrel racers that run on trash ground may need them to prevent injury to their horses although the ground in most arenas have been improved to the point that reason three is almost obsolete before booing this answer i challange every horse owner to research the barefoot trim on the internet and then give your opinion i barrel race and have horses one of which was foundered before she was given to me prior to barefoot trimming every one of my horses had issues with their feet one had a new abcess every week one wore away more foot then she would grow i still never had her shod one had a deformed hoof one had a very bad toe crack the list goes on and on after being trimmed the barefoot way for over two years none of my horses have taken a lame step the foundered horse that was given away because the former owner did not want to deal with her she is perfectly sound and i have the x rays to prove it she had been shod by a very good farrier for years with no improvement the bottom line is that most horse owners dont know why their horses have shoes on them most were bought that way so the new owner assumes that the horse needs shoes chances are that the owner before the previous owner did the same thing there are many hunter jumpers race horses barrel horses polo horses and endurance horses that are barefoot and do their jobs better then horses with shoes if you knew the damage that shoes do to your horses feet then you too would have them pulled here are some links for you to read if you want to some of the best horsemen in the business are barefoot for example clinto anderson lets see yall boo him  Horse Horseshoe Horse gait Volleyball Dressage Horse tack Skateboarding trick Arabian horse Laminitis High-heeled shoe Fast bowling Shoe Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Aerial (dance move) Cowboy M16 (rifle) Drag racing New York Giants Diving Parachute Evolution of the Horse Curling 1957 World Series Babe Ruth Show jumping Irish dance Tennessee Walker Thoroughbred Dog agility Handloading Glossary of climbing terms Mario Theory of conduct Dog training Paul Is Dead Poker jargon Seabiscuit Hard disk Avenue Q Oakland Athletics Paintball Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 GLOCK Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Toronto Raptors Callus Figure skating Milton H.

any training ideas to get a yr old twh past being herd bound we made a major mistake in never taking this horse away from his mom except for a brief month period with a trainer when he was yrs old while at the trainers he didn't have a problem leaving other horses and while still very green he was ok on the trail when under saddle he will not walk away from mom more than a few yards he does not buck rear or jump around he just puts on the breaks and tries to turn around and go back to her side we took him completely away from his mom and off our property and placed him with his half sister sure enough they immediately bonded and again he would not walk away under saddle what can we do he is very herd bound which is obvious you need to become his herd work with him in a round pen if you have one seperate him from other horses and deal with the weaning process when you start taking him out under saddle do it in baby steps at side with saddle walk him when he gets upset stop and talk to him to settle him when he settles even for seconds take him home take it farther each day when he is good about a hand walk trail ride then do the same with you in the saddle the worst thing you can do is give him what he wants another horse and when he is fussing you have to win so have a stud chain handy so if you need a bit more control you can put them on so he can't walk on you don't let him misbehave into getting back to his comfort zone end your sessions on a good note and always give him a good grooming or rub down after all of this its a treat he will remember when he is bad tie him to a post and let him stand for a while as long as it is a safe tie post hope this helps  Horse Equine conformation Horse tack 1957 World Series Dog training Captain Thunderbolt Comanche Social rule The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Poker jargon Milton H.

any ideas on how to load my difficult mare my mare is terrible to load into horseboxes and trailers her previous owners said she had an accident in one she can be incredibly stubborn and on some occasions will load fine and others panic and fret we have tried a few techniques the problem is she gets too dangerous to handle and has a tendency to get carried away and rear any tips or ideas all my others load fine but to my horror food doesnt work we own a two horse trailer it takes two hh horses my mare is in the past when we have successfully loaded her not often it has been without a partition and she hs been cross tied once in the box and travelling she is fine you need to spend a lot of time working with her when your only goal for that session is to get her to load not get her into the trailer so you can go somewhere for an event and you have to be there at a certain time this needs time put a halter with a long lead rope on your horse lead him up to the open door of the trailer if it is a step up trailer get it parked so that the step isn't very high such as backed up to a slight hill so the ground is only a few inches from the step if at all possible your horse will probably stop and balk at the door leave the halter rope as slack as possible to let him sniff and breathe and lower his head to check out the trailer floor he needs to test it to see if it is safe pet him just a little then ask him to go forward by popping him lightly on his back which is beside you don't stand behind him or in front of him you are not pulling him or driving him into the trailer pop him consistently until you get a response from him you may have to pop a little harder for a desensitized horse a sensitive horse you will hardly need to even touch with the rope and they will jump forward if he pulls back or tries to go around the trailer door give him trouble either jerk down hard on the halter rope straight toward the ground holding the rope just under his chin or if he really wants to back up make him back up quickly with short jerks backward on the rope and immediately get him up to the door of the trailer again before you let him stand perfectly still and relax the main idea here is to make the trailer the safe place for the horse to be start with the safe place being the open door later the safe place will be inside the trailer your goal is to get the horse to want to stand at the door then encourage him to take a step forward what you must do to accomplish this is reward him for any forward movement to the trailer this includes just barely inching one foot forward the second he lifts a foot to move forward your consistent popping with the halter rope stops immediately and you praise the horse pet him talk to him and let him stand a moment then ask him to take one more step by starting the popping again this is how you move his safe place forward into the trailer any backward or sideways movement results in his getting jerked backed up or if he is moving wildly run him in circles around you to take out some of the energy he has he should learn that it's a lot of hard work for him to disobey use his lazy nature to get your desired result standing in the trailer if you get him right to the trailer door and he won't step up you can pick up a front hoof and place it in the trailer he may take it back but continue the popping then eventually he will learn to step in at first only let him put his front feet in and then stop him and after a moment ask him to step back out you can pet him praise him and then ask for forward movement again remember to always reward his forward movement once he is completely inside the trailer try to back him out again it is scary for a horse to get out and you don't want him to freeze up once he gets inside repeat the whole process a few times and only when he is loading smoothly would i give him any treats or grain inside the trailer let him stand for awhile just petting him and standing near him in the trailer the more this is repeated such as the next day and the day after that the better your horse will get remember you are not pulling or driving the horse into the trailer your desired result is that he sees the open gate of the trailer and thinks oh that's my comfortable safe place i'm gonna go jump in there the horse should walk right in comfortably hope this works for you if your horse is really wild you might have a little more trouble and need to do more groundwork before you try loading him but i guarantee you this is the best way to put a horse in a trailer the other methods coaxing in with treats or putting a rope on his hind end or hitting the horse to drive it in to the trailer aren't good for you or your horse and though this way takes longer initially it will teach your horse the best mindset to have when trailer loading  Horse gait Skateboarding trick Horse tack Professional wrestling aerial techniques 1957 World Series Professional

please only people with real horse expeirence i have a year old qh gelding i bought him as a yearling and trained him myself something i have been doing all my life he is a workingcow horse bred horse and is a ton of fun to ride i have used him at ranch rodeos trail rides and to work cattle at home he like all of our horse has been exposed to a lot of stuff and is ridden quite frequently times a week he has awesome ground manners and is very responsive to ride okay with all that said here is the flaw he bucks it happens randomly i can lunge him and be min into a ride and it will happen it can happen right away he has thrown me more than any other horse has and i train horses as always i get back on if i have been thrown and continue the workout if i know he is going to do it i can usually stay on and get after him the vet says he healthy i am really tired of it and trying to decide if there is anything that i can do or if i should sell him and get another any thoughts the first thing to do is determine why the horse is bucking have your dvm go over the horse again and look for things that might contribute to this behavior are you using a good farrier that is confident the horse is not having any pain or issues if the feet aren t feeling their best that can lead to some issues think about a woman in tight fitting high heel shoes that hurt to walk in what equipment are you using have you checked to see nothing is pinching rubbing slipping irritating equipment can change and we may not be aware of it but the horse certainly will be are you asking the horse for the same response on the line or riding that may be causing the bucking if this is happening when asking for an upward or downward transition it may be something related to the actions involved how is the horse s balance could the bucking be an answer to being off balance do you have someone who can watch you from the ground and help evaluate why this is happening if you have an extra set of experienced eyes you might be able to see the issue right away videotaping is another way to see what is going on when you are not involved in the activity has anyone else lunged or ridden this horse and had the same results or no bucking at all if they are using your equipment it might be something physical that is occurring while you are riding how you and the equipment interact we have certainly had some horses over the years that enjoyed bucking lots of them were from the same basic breeding lines too the old adage comes to mind here a mule can t kick and pull and the same time and neither can you same with the horse if he is moving forward with impulsion bucking is counter indicated  Equine conformation Horse gait Milton H.

have an extremely aggressive horse i can not get any groundwork done with one of my horses he is amazing in the show ring undersaddle but on the ground he has no respect for any human i have even had differnt trainers work with him and none of them are able to do a thing with him because he is to dangerous if you try to work on something simple like backing when you ask he just puts his ears back like yeah right then if i start to tap him on the chest with the whip hes rears up over my head and comes down at me striking out and choping his teeth if i try to lounge him he is constanly kicking at me with both feet on the lounge i do not let him run over me i always get him to do what i ask him to but it never seems to get any better and we just have a huge fight i dont like fighting with my horse i have tried methods straight out of my john lyons and clinton anderson books and get no results i have never met a horse like him he just despises people is there anything differnt i can do alright i will anwser some of your questions here he has always been fairly aggressive in the two years i have had him after the first two months i had him he was steadily getting more and more irritable i did have him check by my vet who found a pretty large bean in his sheath once that was removed he calmed down slightly but the agression never went away he is totally healthy now i have had proffesional trainers tell me to put him down because hes vicious i just really dont want to give up on him he is an amazing talented horse and has won me many blue ribbons in the time ive had him killing him just isnt an option i cant even tell you how many hours we have spent in the round pen with no improvement and i am very calm and paitent with him i dont get whip happy he just kindof comes after me and i stand my ground when he rears and such and dont show him that im afraid but really he has me terrified he has put me in the hospital times with those hooves i have been thinking about just quiting the groundwork because it seems to do nothing but piss him off he is a pretty good horse when hes only being worked undersaddle im just looking for an alternative to selling him or giving up on him i need some fresh idea of what to try with him ive been throught all of the hoorsemanship books watched all the tapes and i am stumped i'm assuming he is a gelding my first thought is that maybe he is a chryptoid that is he retained a testicle up inside of him and when they gelded him they decided not to do surgery to go get it these sound like stud dominance issues the reason why most horses are not left stallions is because they demonstrate these behaviors i would try to track down the owners that had him gelded and ask if this is the case surgery is expensive but can fairly easily be preformed i think for around good luck  Equine conformation Poker jargon Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Horse gait Shaggy dog story Seabiscuit Social rule Dog training Gray Wolf Theory of conduct Kurt Angle Boxing Horseshoe Piccolo Junior Saga Guinea pig Dog 1957 World Series Dog agility Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Beavis and Butt-head World Championship Wrestling Dragon Booster Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ben Johnson (athlete) Hamster Arabian horse New York Giants Extreme Programming Fast bowling Professional wrestling attacks Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Professional wrestling throws Unreal Milton H.

how much does a pony cost a month in the uk i really want this pony http www bomb proof co uk details php horseid but am having a hard time convincing my parents that it is not to expensive and there are ways to save money when owning a pony i have just bought a horse and its quite expensive to begin with when your getting use to things but as you get used to it it does settle down suggest you get a pony on loan to begin with and see how it goes i have broken down all the individual costs so you can see where the money goes livery if your thinking about diy livery where you do everything then depending on the yard and its facilities then this can range between per week if your going for part livery then obvioulsy the cost goes up between approx this is where you share the looking after with the yard owners for example they turn him her out on a morning and you do the evening you can say good bye to sleeping in if you choose diy and then theres full livery where all you do is turn up and ride this can cost you can also do working livery where you can offset the cost of looking after your pony by allowing the yard to use him for teaching food you will need hay haylage hay costs around a bail and haylage costs for a small and for a medium size bail how much you need will depend on whether your yard has full year turn out you will also need concentrate which on average must be around the mark per week farrier this will need to be done every weeks or so and costs around equipment if your pony comes with tack then this will reduce your cost if not then you can look at anywhere between for a saddle and around for a bridle depends if you need to have a custome made one this is extremely important to get the right fitting tack as your pony will only suffer if they dont fit correctly and then theres all the different rugs and stuff each rug is around you can go on forever buying all different kinds of things but i reckon i pay around for diy livery and everything else but i only pay per week good luck  Equine conformation Dairy British Rail Class 86 Horse tack Cowboy Sailing Credit card Insurance Pittsburgh Steelers Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Hunt seat Capitalism Life insurance Mattress Unemployment Mutual fund Outsourcing Hyperinflation My Little Pony Welding Horse Extreme Programming Education in Germany United Kingdom corporation tax Solar cell Inventory Microeconomics Illegal drug trade American Motors Compiler optimization Law of value Stock Rigging Gold standard Bulk vending Money Capital accumulation Citigroup Tack Surplus value Neopets Anarchism and capitalism Graduate school Pony Transformer Nicomachean Ethics CPU cache Deflation (economics) Betting (poker) Pony Express Leasing Education in the People's Republic of China Tax Economics Horseshoe Cable television Nuclear warfare Wind turbine Sewage treatment Deftones Gross domestic product B-47 Stratojet 401(k) Labour economics Labor theory of value Captain Thunderbolt Archery Health insurance Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Final Fantasy XI Laserdisc Taxicab Best Buy MMORPG EastEnders Craps FairTax British Rail Class 317 Air New Zealand Digital photography American individualist anarchism Social Security (United States) Flat tax United States Postal Service Supply and demand USS Tunny (SS-282) General Dynamics F-111 Diving cylinder Broadband Internet access Personal finance Cruising (maritime) Swedish allotment system

horse with infected hock my horse is currently in horsey hospital with an infected hock after being kicked in the field he may also have a hairline fracture which hasn't been confirmed yet however the vets are not worried about this his infected hock has been operated on and all the infection has hopefully been removed and its just a case of waiting to see if it comes back or not and waiting forit to heal has anyone had any experience with this and can let me know how the horse that they know about is back normal etc plz dont anyone just say get him put down as the vets are not saying this and its a very sensitive subject i just want to see if others have had this problem and recovered thanks a lot depends if the infection was in the bursa which is the tendon sheath we had a very expensive show prospect yearling same thing got kicked in the hock infection and she had surgery to flush it it can be a very slow and long process and once he comes home you probably will still be giving antibiotics and changing dressings several times per day our yearling had to wear a pressure garment that went from the fetlock up just past the hock over the top of the dressings because she was a yearling we were in no hurry to start her but it finished any hopes of her being a show horse because the cap of the hock became bulbous with quite a large scar she was eventually broken and sold more as a family type horse the main thing is to write down all the questions that you have and ask the vet before she comes home follow their directions to the letter and if you see any swelling discharge heat etc that wasn't there the day before call them immediately as they may need to change the antibiotics keep on top of changing dressings and ask them to show you how to wrap it because hocks are a pain to wrap and have it stay in place taking his temp is also a good idea morning and night because if it becomes elevated that's a sign that the infection is coming back from the sounds of it the vets seem quite confident and i'd just follow their direction i'm sure he'll be fine but it's slow process  Equine conformation Traumatic brain injury Pneumonia Domestic rabbit Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma CPU cache Prostate cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cirrhosis Hip fracture First aid Sin City Carpal tunnel syndrome Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Brewery Milton H.

what do you do if a horse is playful stubborn bucking no health problems or indication of bolting just no i dont wanna or how dare you be on my back and if it has alrady been lunged how would do you handle it im just curious and for my own reasons because every bucking fit etc ive been told is caused by health problems and ive never been told what to do if hes basically taking the p s i know exactlyhow you feel i too had a horse still have him that would try to buck me off every time i rode him literally i too had him checked out by a vet and nothing was physically wrong with him what happened is he was testing me and figuring out that he could get me off his back because that was the first time i ever had to deal with a bucking horse you can probably feel him getting ready to buck right so if i were you i would put an end to it right there turn him in circles and i mean as tight as you can go both ways because that makes it very difficult for the horse to buck or rear because he loses the power that he would need to buck then i would really start making him work by this i mean turns transitions back him take him over and through any obstacle you can imagine even if it is around a tree or barrel get him so he doesn't know what is coming next if he starts this i don't want to attitude i would go and get yourself a pair of spurs or a crop to get his attention and let him know that you aren't going to put up with his crap any longer but remember to only use these when necessary and don't overuse them either you only want to get his attention focused on you and what you want to do another thing you could try is if he does it but balks you the whole way you could make him do a bunch of other things as well and then return to what ever he doesn't like to do and then if he does what you want reward him and get off his back and be done for the day this is kind of like when a kid balks cleaning his room because he wants to go play basketball that is when the parent would say 'fine if you are going to give me this attitude then you are going to do the dishes vaccum do the laundry and clean your room before you go and do what you want to do with a horse like this i would only ride him for min tops if he does what you want him to do and you get what you wanted accomplished until he is really good and then you can ride him for however long you want to then he learns that his reward for a job well done is being done with his lesson but if he is being a pill make sure you always end things on a good note no matter how long it takes these are some of the things i did when i had a bucking horse and i'm proud to say that he hasn't bucked in years hope this helps  Equine conformation Theory of conduct Milton H.

how do you properly ask for the hand gallop the hand gallop isn't really a gallop it is just an extended canter just like an extended trot when you ask for this you want to raise your body into a two point and squeeze your legs your horse will more than likely take heed of your cues and pick up the pace but make sure that he's still going in a three beat rhythm otherwise you are literally galloping you should also feel a lengthening of stide and not necessarily quicker paced legs you still are going to want collection but encourage him to move out with a longer stride hope this helps  Horse gait Horse Dressage Equine conformation Show hunter Trot (horse gait) Harness racing Eventing Cross-country equestrianism Snooker Fast bowling Equitation Professional wrestling holds Standardbred horse Parade (military) Jazz Milton H.

my horse pulls on me when i lunge him i own a year old mini gelding and i am currently lunging him every other day to get him in shape for an upcoming show normally he does very well and we have no problms but recently he has been pulling on me very hard he only does it one way clockwise and i don't understand what started to make him do it he will pull so hard on me that he actually bends his neck to the side i only weigh pounds while he weighs so it's hard for me to keep hold of him to make matters worse i have a bad wrist and it's not good to have him pull on it like that i can't afford a round pen or else i would get one so far i have tried to pull back on him when he pulls but that just makes him stop i have also tapped him with the whip when he does it but that just makes him pull harder i'm at a loss as to why he started to do this and how to fix it i know i'm not over working him because he doesn't even pant when i'm done if you have any idea of how to make him stop that would be great i have a mini gelding who likes to do the same thing he will do this just out of simple rebellion when i lunge him with the halter with the halter it doesn't bother him to pull on me but what i have found with him that works is either a chain over then nose or put a bit in his mouth put the chain through his halter around his nose and lunge as normal this way when he pulls the chain is a more direct and painful pressure so he will avoid pulling on it also simply put his bridle on with his bit in his mouth and put the lunge line through the ring of the near side and over the head to clip to the outside ring then lunge this way again the bit is a more adverse pressuer that he will be more likely to not want to cause on himself also if he's tending to try to run away out one side of the circle or even just pulling the whole way around remember that when you jerk on his head you must also give him a smack on the rear with the lunge whip this says give to the pressure but keep going forward simply continue this pull and smack pattern until he understands that you'll leave him alone when he quite pulling  Equine conformation Dog training Professional wrestling holds Swingout Diving Aerial (dance move) Milton H.

any insite on the welsh cob breed what is everyones opinion in regards to welsh cobs i know every horse is different but what is the experience you all have had with them i have an opportunity to buy one for my kids to ride but have never been around the breed before i appreciate any insite that you all may have thanks this breed is a wonderful breed for children and is very popular as a family horse because not only is it small enough for a child to ride it is also very strong and can carry a large man with great ease the welsh cob is one of four different types of the welsh family it is the largest and strongest of the breeds as it was the result of the welsh mountain ponies being crossed with roman imports such as the analucian it became a war horse both carrying mounted men as well as for pulling cannons this is a very versitile pony and does very well in both riding and driving and jumps extremely well these ponies are very brave and kind and come in any color except pinto and there height only goes up to about hands i myself never had a welsh but i have plenty of friends that do and they never seem to buck kick or rear which makes them very safe for kids if the pony is good with kids then i would consider it but before you buy it make sure to take the kids to see it and ride it and make your judgement from there if it handles all the petting and is patient with them when they are riding him then i would see no reason not to get it have fun  Welsh Cob (Section D) Horse Pony Welsh pony of cob type (Section C) Welsh mountain pony (Section A) Welsh pony (Section B) Arabian horse Equine conformation Connemara pony Domestic rabbit Hunt seat American Quarter Horse Working animal Pony of the Americas Morgan horse Hackney (horse) Dales Pony Dressage Horses of Middle-earth Chocobo Scuba set Domestication of the horse The Red Pony Wales Cowboy Show hunter Aerial (dance move) Roan (color) Dog Horse show My Little Pony Anchor Icelandic horse Friesian horse Tire Lipizzan Maize Wayne Corporation Mixed-breed dog Livestock Falconry Domestic goat Horse gait Horse tack Species Dog agility Comanche Show jumping Skateboarding trick Volleyball Herding dog Kimi Finster Super Mario 64 Thoroughbred Akhal-Teke Eventing Zoophilia Evolution of the Horse Bondage (BDSM) One Piece minor characters Road Ancient warfare Labrador Retriever Dragon Booster Bicycle frame Shetland pony Bicycle Minor Harry Potter Beasts Hamster Mountain bike Cavalry New Forest pony First English Civil War Spanking Anglesey Shaggy dog story Kitesurfing Abortion debate The Fairly OddParents Rear wheel drive Milton H.

how do i get my horse to stop throwing his head i have a horse who throws his head when i ask him to back or sidepass i know it is not that he has a sore tooth because he does it whether i am using a bit or a bosal how can i correct this without using a training fork or an overcheck my horse is a year old quarter horse gelding i use a tom thumb bit on him he has an appointment to get his teeth floated in a few days but he only throws his head when i ask him to back or sidepass i also know that it has nothing to do with his training as he has had extensive training and was at one point in his career a very successful show horse also he just began doing this a few weeks ago im going to throw this out there cause it hasnt been mentioned yet when was the last time you had your horses teeth floated is he young enough that he may have had his wolfe teeth forgotten i know several that they just didnt errupt till later and at that point it may have just left the owners mind no ones fault it just happens i had a friend with a year old well trained morgan gelding that all of a sudden he started with the head tossing and it was his wolfe teeth regular floating sometimes twice a year can become the norm as a horse gets older and if you randomly tie a horse down when hes in physical pain your not only going to cause him to act out more demonstratively but your risking your own neck look for the cause first i dont have much of an issue with a tie down if its used properly not as a quick fix  Horse tack Equine conformation Horse Piccolo Junior Saga New York Giants Sin City First aid Pittsburgh Steelers Volleyball Dog training Arabian horse Sandy Koufax Cleveland Browns Coin flipping Wyatt Earp Professional wrestling throws Dog Tenshinhan San Francisco 49ers Domestic rabbit Weight training Professional wrestling holds Tennessee Walker Doom enemies Tour de France Battles of Lexington and Concord National Football League Lore Tooth Diving Japan Cup Super Bowl XXVII Northerly The Family from One End Street Scientology beliefs and practices Trapping Milton H.

can i make my own saddle pad i want to know if it is a good idea to make a saddle pad right now i only have this dinky little blanket that is probably very uncomfortable for my horse anyways how would i do it what type of material should i use couldn't i just buy some wool and cover it with material i also have a saddle fitting issue could getting a thick saddle pad help i can afford one i would rather make it for a project a saddle pad can never fully compensate for a poorly fitting saddle if the saddle fits properly you won't need a thick pad to keep him comfortable you can get a simple shaped fleece pad or a square quilted pad for pretty cheap and that's all you should ever need saddle fitting is something you shouldn't skimp on it's like someone asking you to wear shoes that don't fit right and saying that thicker socks will cure the problem your feet will hate you in the end for wearing them and your horse's back isn't going to be happy with you after riding in a saddle that doesn't fit just ride bareback or borrow a saddle until you can buy a saddle that fits properly  Mattress Equine conformation Strap-on dildo Horse tack Bicycle frame Cowboy Diving suit High-heeled shoe Sanitary towel Shoe Undergarment Tire Sock Brassiere Bicycle Horseshoe Textile manufacturing Seismic retrofit Japanese tea ceremony Western Saddle Textile manufacturing terminology Climbing equipment Chair Mouse (computing) Tank Violin Stirrup Clothing Sample chess game Glossary of climbing terms Snowboard Upholstery Bicycle helmet Chariot Double bass Guitar Bull riding Shaggy dog story Floyd Rose Archery Joint Theory of conduct Welding Condom Stocking Gas metal arc welding Bicycle brake systems M16 (rifle) Free trade Ed, Edd n Eddy Bullet Comanche Milton H.

rotated coffin bone miracle the year old arab mare extremely energetic acts like she's i used to ride rotated her coffin bone front right leg last december and it has continued to rotated to degrees the last few months it has stayed stable however she coliced mildly a month ago and had to be walked for hours this week her owner got on her and rode her at a walk trot and canter after working her on the lunge line and not noticing any lameness whatsoever the vet came out and took x rays and told us that he had never seen a horse so sound with such a badly rotated coffin bone i will be able to start riding her at a walk and a trot and someday cantering her again what are your thoughts on this and is there any explanation you can offer also does anyone know of anything i should do to help her note this is not a horse that you can leave out in her paddock and expect her to be ok if you aren't working her she's a very well trained dressage horse who is a dream in the arena and on the trails thank you lisa m she has been on a minimum feed diet she gets just enough feed not sweet feed either to add in her wormer and bute powder she gets hay but quite a bit less than she used to her small paddock is almost completely dirt as she paces and runs around a lot the coffin bone rotation was and is rotated farther than most do however it was possible it may rotate back no matter how severe it was estimated at years for it to rotate back however but simply based on how far it is any other horse would be dead right now this horse has several other health problems including being somewhat diabetic at least that's how it was explained to me and having very puffy wind puffs on her back legs forgot to mention she does have a special shoe on it is basically just on backwards the farrier and the vet do work together and that's how they decided how to put the shoe on she also had an abcess on this same foot this summer she is not foundering and does not have laminitis her coffin bone was rotated and the only complication caused by that was the abcess i'm not sure what type of hay she is getting but the people who feed her are well instructed by the vet on what she should be getting fed what hay do you feed her i'm sure your vet has advised against alfalfa but just checking cuz you just said hay if the rotation has stopped and you the vet and farrier are working together then its just a matter of time to let the bone heal and the foot grow around it rotating it slowly back into position do not rush things founder can return in a heartbeat do not feed anything that can refine to sugar no alfalfa no fresh grass no apples no rice bran no sweet feed etc orchard and oat hay are the best for laminitis as was explained to me when i had a horse with laminitis she never rotated though alfalfa even in small quantity would shoot her back into softened lamini keep the exercise going treat her back end with the windpuffs also most likely caused by her putting more weight in back to relieve pressure on front with proper care sounds like your doing that love attention and exercise she'll live a long happy showing life  Horse Laminitis Horse gait Dressage Guinea pig Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Hamster Swingout Shaggy dog story Tennessee Walker First aid Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stomach cancer Alfalfa Skateboarding trick Horse tack Dog training Japanese tea ceremony Horseshoe Dairy Seabiscuit Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Breastfeeding Marching band Hay Aerial (dance move) Pet skunk Chicken Swimming Fast bowling Milton H.

why do geldings make a 'hiccupping' or 'chirruping' noise when they trot or canter does the noise come from the stomach or respiratory system having owned horses from age to i've always wondered why geldings make that noise but never found out why well i never i would never have guessed it was that thanks to all technically its the muscles that hold the penis up inside the sheath rubbing against other muscles and areas in the male horse's groin area its like when your drying a car and the rag squeaks against the metal or when your riding and your leg squeaks on the saddle its very normal although not all geldings will make this sound although cleaning the sheath could help quiet the sound on some it doesn't work on all horses  Horse Equine conformation Comanche Horse gait Dressage Strap-on dildo Horse tack Salad Fingers Hiccup Code 46 Cat Arabian horse Mouse (computing) Castration Onomatopoeia Penis Japan Cup Floyd Rose Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Glossary of climbing terms Equitation Muscle Fecal incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cross-country equestrianism Hunt seat Harness racing Show hunter Mattress Icelandic horse Seabiscuit Sex organ Headcrab The Dalek Invasion of Earth Professional wrestling holds Standardbred horse Erectile dysfunction Jam (TV series) Human anatomy Eventing International Phonetic Alphabet Puberty Human penis size Sex toy Tennessee Walker American Saddlebred Aerial (dance move) Cowboy Welsh Cob (Section D) Sulky Trot (horse gait) Spanish Riding School Noise music Washboard Masturbation Air pollution Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Bicycle Gramophone record German grammar Multiple sclerosis Abdomen Urinary incontinence Male reproductive system (human) Obstetrics Knife Traveller (horse) John Wayne Friction Guinea pig Lung Respiratory system Jackass: The Movie Noise pollution Speech recognition Violin Combine (Half-Life 2) Cowboy boot Charisma (horse) Fancy rat Belmont Stakes Bong Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Insomnia 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Gilding Duchenne muscular dystrophy Akhal-Teke Heart sounds Sonar Rail tracks Smegma Condom The Legend of Zelda series enemies Ridged band Microphone Toilet humour Chicken Langmuir probe

my friend flicka whoever coined that term sorry but i just have to use it for lack of a better description what can you say to a person to get them out of their my friend flicka mindset my mother is a total my friend flicka advocate i want to get some ideas on what to say to snap her back into harsh reality ok to explain a description of a my friend flicka it's a person who believes that horses act just the same in reality as they do in movies these people think that if you whisper to a wild horse and pet it and love on it you can go galloping through the wildnerness bareback without having to actually break it they think it's cruel to give a horse a slap for anything even if it's mowing you down kicking or biting at you or is otherwise showing bratty behaviors they often give you bad advice for such situations like feeding the horse out of your hands and giving it lots of treats and love should the horse kick at you ect i totally agree with you mulereiner but what can you say to a person with that kind of a mindset my mother keeps nagging me you're so cruel to that horse don't whip him for biting you that's mean it's about to drive me slap nutty crazy i need a way to explain to her that these animals need discipline no no i'm just using the biting scenario as an example now now let's be nice and not target certain individuals in our posts okay xd show her pictures of what happens to the blm's that end up at auction because someone with that mindset bought them for their teenager try to look on youtube for horses gone crazy videos to show her if that doesn't sink in show her the bronc competitions on espn those horses are that way for a reason my friend flicka thunderhead and green grass of wyoming is the ultimate trilogy but there was more to the original my friend flicka than was portrayed in the recent rendition when the original came out the majority of people were still country bumpkins with a little bit of horse sense enough to know what side to mount on the new my friend flicka was a good movie for disney purposes but it just reinforced the belief of the citizens that they can hop on a wild animal and gallop away with the aid of a few carrots and sneaking into the pasture it's a damn shame people should leave the horses to the horse people and if they want to learn about them they should do it slowly and invest into it free horses cheap or free trainers trouble old cowboy saying green green black and blue  Horse Theory of conduct Only Fools and Horses Horse breaking W.I.T.C.H.

why is everyone's answer always to use a tie down don't they know about other riding techniques i come on here to try to help people train their horse in a safe manner there are legitimate horse training questions questions that are great opportunities for the riders to learn more yet the answers are almost always the same get a tie down get a martingale what the heck guys there is such a thing as learning to train your horse without the use of harmful gadgets good classical patient training and riding will do the best for your horse not gadgets is anyone else scared of these novice horse people being given such incorrect answers does anyone else think that a tiedown is harmful and dangerous to both horse and rider more importantly in the few events that a tiedown should be used does anyone else think it should be reserved for qualified trainers bloodhound the fact that you find it acceptable to use the same training aid on almost all of your horses is remarkable training is the adeptation of appropriate tools techniques to individual horses with unique situaitons and personalities the same tools cannot be used on every horse successfully each horse is different as is every rider if you think that a tie down is the answer for every horse you cannot call yourself a trainer a trainer is one who listens to the horse's needs and adapts their training to each horse yup i agree with you also there is tons of junk advice given by people that have no clue how to properly ride a horse let alone train them for some reason they flock to y a horse section and become 'trainers' i went to a ranch rodeo last weekend and watched some of the horses in warm up i realize they are 'roping horses' and need a tie down when doing their job however these horses had no basic training on suppleness and bending at the pole etc their heads were so high up and only held back by the tie down that was just in warm up there is no reason why a roping horse can't have the proper training and i have seen some dang good ones that were what drives me bonkers doesn't take much anymore on here lol is seeing the tie downs used and not run through the breast collar so when the horse does briefly lower its head the strap dangles and they can get their leg hung up it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that wreck coming a mile away i have ppl that board paddocks down from me i have never seen them bit their horses with the bit facing the correct way no kidding you tell them but they still do it i have seen another boarder saddle a horse run the rear cinch around the flank and have a rodeo free for me i can write a book on how not to train your horse by what i see out at my boarding area all i can say is the horses that wind up in the hands of those that want to learn and take lessons and those that are skilled after taking lessons and never stop learning are the most blessed animals on earth i pity all the other ones  Horse Horse tack Equine conformation Comanche Dressage Kitesurfing Spanking Bull riding Seabiscuit Glossary of climbing terms Eventing Rodeo Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Horse breaking Weight training Dog training Dog agility Archery Roller coaster Cattle Motorcycle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bullfighting Paragliding Skateboarding trick Horse gait Scientology beliefs and practices Parachuting Professional wrestling holds Alexander Technique Boxing Sin City Milton H.

warmbloods someone was bragging about having a warmblood to me earlier today and i don't completely know what that is i don't think she knew either from what i know or think i know correct me if wrong a warmblood is any horse that is not a draft coldbloods thoroughbred or arabian hotbloods they include horses that are mix of a bunch of different breeds as well as purebreds if this is correct then what is the point of having a warmblood and what are the benefits and do people really register them what is the point if almost everything is a warmblood so can you have a registered qh who is also a registered warmblood my the definition of warmblood varies but the one thing that rings true is that they are good competition horses on the note of a qh being registered as a warmblood they are called an appendix bred i have an appendix paint he is recently crossed tb is fresh in his pedigree qh and tb and is an amazing performer in western pleasure dressage and games i did not pay thousands of dollars for him actually i didn't even pay the appendix breeds typically tend to be cheaper then the european bred warmbloods however regardless of breed a horse is just a horse until it has established pedigree and training if you seek out an own foal of an olympian expect to pay thousands that's a high buck baby if you just buy a foal or a two year old even that has not much really for pedigree and little training but has the conformation you will pay far less with a decent trainer and persistence that foal could be your farlap the thing to remember when seeking out a horse that you intend to show for anything is that breed is a starting point and the pedigree is an enhancer bragging about having a simple warmblood is just silly unless it has skills that warmblood may decide that he doesn't want to compete at all and end up being a trail horse that is how i ended up with my remington so cheap his previous owners were not able to tap into his hidden potential i bought him as a trail horse and in the first few weeks of getting to know him i learned he was capable of more than trails when he put his mind to it we're still working on his ideas that he wears the pants in the relationship for example my mother breeds working cow horses she stands a proven champion sire own son of kaliman and she bred him to a mare that was out of a champion sire the foal grew up to do hunt seat the moral to the story is that a two hundred dollar grade horse from an auction can a top competitor it happens every year this person may have a warmblood but it's just that a warmblooded horse  Thoroughbred Equine conformation Arabian horse Selle Fran__ais Warmblood Dog agility Trakehner Dog show Lipizzan Dressage Horse racing Connemara pony Sunday Silence Eventing Thoroughbred horse race Mixed-breed dog Seabiscuit Hanoverian (horse) Obedience training Appaloosa Cattle Theory of conduct Tennessee Walker Smarty Jones Milton H.

is it bad one of our horses keeps putting his leg in his trough will he get hurt why does he do it please help if you're talking about the watering trough he is most likely pawing water on his belly to keep the bugs off when i was at texas a m we had a mare in the broodmare herd that would do this she'd stand there pawing water onto her belly and emptying the trough the feed crew who had to keep checking the trough to make sure there was water in it hated this mare because of the extra work she caused but i always thought she was smart because she was the only mare in the herd who had worked out that she could keep bugs from biting her this way her foals all learned this behavior from her too wish i could remember her name and breeding maybe your horse is one of her descendants out of a granddaughter who learned the behavior  Horse Thoroughbred Donkey Przewalski's Horse Equine conformation Milton H.

ugh horse problemss i just bought my very own horse and the first few times i rode her she was wonderful she did every thing i asked and was very slow and patient now every time she can't go foward and i make her stand she rears on me and she much too fast for my riding disiplin western now before you say it's a health problem it's not i had vets come out and check her got her teeth done had a full vet check done the vet said it might be her back so i had the chiropracter come and see if any thing was wrong and he said she was fine and so did the farrier so i know now its just her giving me attitude i love my horse so much i just could really use some help on how to slow her down and how to make her stop rearing and stop when i say to stop plz read this info will solve your problem ok well firstly ignore the ppl who are saying that its just a bonding issue and the person who said to hit your horse that could make her head shy and expecially ignore the person who said to use a tie down for several reasons if your horse is a gaited horse the tie down will mess up its gait say your horse does manage to get the strength to rear up with the the tie down on then if she flips over which is dangerous enough shes not going to be able to position her neck correctly and could end up breaking her neck if u plan on trail riding her then i would never use a tie down because i know that wayyyyyy too many trail horses die each year because of tie downs there are lots of different horse parks and ones with rivers are often the most fun but those are the ones that the most horses die at and they die because some of the rivers they have to go against the current or its deep and they have to swim and they cant get their heads up and out of the water far enough to breath and so they end up drowning what i think that your horse needs is an additude adjustment i think that the first few times that u rode her she knew that u were really paying attention and then as u rode it more you became more relaxed and didnt pay attention near as much and i think horses can sense that so now she is pushing u around and testing you and seeing how much she can get away with if i were i would start riding her alot and give her lots of commands and be a very strict or even bossy rider and sort of let her know that your the boss then when she rears up you cant just get off and put her away i cannot stress that enough that is the worst possible thing to do because the last thing u want to do is let your horse get away with murder what you have to do is put both your reins into hand and on side of the reins or on rein slid your hand up it and pull it out and make her do tight circles in direction and circles in the other direction then make her take steps back and just keep doing this every time she rears and eventually she will realize hey this is hard work i better start behaving and then she wont rear because shell know that if she rears or disobeys you that she is gonna have to work and the same thing goes for slowing her down make her do circles and make her back up the only big thing that i want to tell you is for you to make sure that you arent constantly keeping pressure on the reins because then your horse will become accustume to that and then she will be even harder to stop plus i have seen ppl do this and then say oh well this bit isnt giving me enough contact with my horses mouth and then they get a harsher bit and just keep repeating that cycle and they just end up ruining their horse and tearing up his mouth so instead of constant pressure try to use pulses oh and before i forget the tight circles that i told you about they are actually called a reined stop and if your horse ever tries to runaway with you use the reined stop because a horse cant go straight and turn in circles at the same time so do all fo this and that should take care of your problems oh and by the way the person who mentioned perrelli is right about perrilli he is great with horses but hes not going to help you at all with behavior problems  Horse tack Aerial (dance move) Diving Professional wrestling holds Milton H.

really green horse i am rding a really green horse her name is dixie but we call her dee she is a quarter horse mare when i ride her she has problems when going in one corner a i think its becasue she wants to ge see her friends b i think its just her i don't know what to do also she refuses jumps alot and thats a big problem so plz tell me what i can do for theese problems i myself would give her plenty of extra leg when you get to that corner if she fails to yeild to your commands then i would resort to spurs don't worry you don't have to spur her to death usually the feel of the spurs is enough to get the horse to move but make sure you use the spurs only when necessary if she isn't focusing on you then make her work do turns pivots circles transitions leg yeilds etc to make her listen and then continue on with what you were doing and with the jumping make sure she gets checked by a vet because if it just started lately she my be experiencingback pain also get her teeth checked because she may have dental problems also check yourself too to make sure you are riding properly make sure your position is correct heels down head up secure leg etc especially while going over the jump because if you are unbalanced you may be accidentally hitting the horse's mouth so now the horse associates pain with jumping also make sure that you are confident and not hesitating yourself because the horse will sense that and think something is wrong if you are uncomfortable with jumping then i would go back to cavalettis and smaller jumps and then work your way to higher jumps make sure that the horse is going fast enough so he has the impulsion to jump it make sure that she's meeting the fence squarely and if you feel her hesitating give her an extra squeeze with your leg again if you have to resort to a tap on her side with the spurs if she has been refusing a lot she may have begun to learn that she can get away with it if the horse has been over jumped then she may have begun to hate it so work in other things besides jumping to balance it out hope this helps  Equine conformation Horse Diving Aerial (dance move) Horse gait Skateboarding trick Professional wrestling holds Show jumping Professional wrestling attacks Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Dressage Social rule Swingout Professional wrestling throws Taikyoku shogi Milton H.

horse club hoof help i have a horse with whose front right hoof is clubbed and her shoe keeps on coming off when it starts to get loose like today we take it off along with her other front hoof to balance it off but i've noticed that her sole on her club hoof protrudes further than her hoof wall making it touch the ground i'm worried this will cause concussion problems in her legs and hooves so should i still ride her i'll only be riding in a field and the ground is quite firm with a layer of grass to soften it but i'm still worried will it damage her hoof even if i don't ride her if she's just grazing in the field ps the farrier is so busy at the moment we have to wait for a while for him to come and sort it out i wouldn't ride her without shoes i would also consider getting a farrier whose shoes stay on and is prepared to come on and fix his shoes when they come loose see if you can find someone that does corrective shoeing because that can really help the shape and form of a club foot  Horseshoe Equine conformation Laminitis Horse gait Evolution of the Horse Dressage Horse Glossary of climbing terms Shoe Shaggy dog story Battles of Lexington and Concord Marching band Volleyball High-heeled shoe Show hunter Skateboarding trick Skateboarding Show jumping Chaps The Adventure of the Priory School Evidence of evolution Softball Laws of cricket Fast bowling Dog agility Comanche Mattress Curling Jersey Devil Cricket Clydesdale (breed) Desertification My Little Pony The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Punt (boat) Jon Secada Trot (horse gait) Sock Mercury Atlas 6 Pliocene Appaloosa 1957 World Series Ostrich Arabian horse Glossary of ballet terms Doom enemies Breaststroke Tennessee Walker Snowboard Claw Tire Saint Nicholas First English Civil War Naruto jutsu Bicycle frame Charles Goodyear Bicycle Loafers Wood carving STS-114 Unclean animals Paragliding Seabiscuit Backstroke Recumbent bicycle Airport Knife Glacier Foot Sleipnir Irish dance Football (soccer) Dragon Booster American football Undergarment The Beatles discography Trapping Shoe fetishism Walking Gliding Sport rowing Climbing equipment Piccolo Junior Saga Disneyland Grand Teton National Park Ben Johnson (athlete) Tank Field hockey Shodo Fenway Park Land mine Diving Shofar Golf Four square Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Battle of Vicksburg Sorraia

horse biting at chest shoulder when i put my leg on my year old anglo has these periods of biting snapping at his chest shoulder he mainly does this when i put my leg on i have had vet chiropractic dental work and checks with nothing standing out as the cause tried different saddles different riders but always the same he gets so bad sometimes he feels like he will buck or rear if i ask him forward i have found the only way to stop this is to ride with a crop and sometimes as he will attempt to bite at both sides he does this for periods of a few weeks then settles again with only the occasional half hearted attempt i have tried herbal remedies had him checked for allergies in the paddock he is allergic to wheat i am now at a total loss as to what to do in every other way he is a fantastic horse and so obliging and easy going what are ppl's thoughts behavioural or physical this is holding back our progress thanks i purchased this horse as an unstarted yo had him started by a friend so i know there is no history of abuse cause i also knew the breeder well he was started at yo put out for mths then brought back in to begin training has only had light medium work this started around months ago and has been on and off since he is fine with cinching girthing for us aussies ha ha absolutely no issues there i agree with some of you i thought he was ticklish but there is no set pattern i can ride for hour with no sign of it yet the next time he does it from the moment i ask him forward extremely frustrating i ride with a crop and give him a gentle tap on the nose or just let him run into the crop as he swings his head around and that soon stops him so i agree it is more behavioural but i would still love to find out why he does this my own thoughts are that he may have had a problem cause the first time he did it i got off and checked him out and got back on then did it again so i got off again voila he had found a way to be allowed to stop and me get off so he keeps trying it but i am wise to this tactic he is a smart boy i agree it could be that he has sensitive or touchy sides since you have consulted a vet dentist and chiropractor i would assume this is behavioral have you tried correcting him when he does this maybe there are some holes in his training that need to be patched up before you ask for any more progress from him maybe you could have your friend who trained him to come out and help at least you're on the right track  Equine conformation Horse Horse tack Dog Professional wrestling throws Milton H.

would you say that now in australia horses are fairly cheap generally i know there are the top quality competition horses but a general young all rounder is fairly inexpensive compared to other countries at the moment obviously there is nothing constant but if someone could give me a general idea of the horse market is aus it would be greatly appreciated the average going price for a reasonable all rounder is between yes the prices have dropped with people finding it hard to keep up with the escalating feed costs due to the drought but people that know their horse's real value will stick to the price knowing they will get it because a good horse is worth it's weight in gold personally i would rather spend the money to get a good horse in the end it is worth it rather than feeding a horse that isn't suitable i have been blessed with fantastic horses one i got for and the other i paid for so they are out there at either end of the scale i can't comment on other countries as i have never really looked at what horses are worth in other countries  Inflation Deflation (economics) Gold standard Hyperinflation Supply-side economics Tax Gross domestic product Microeconomics Law of value Economy of Africa RuneScape economy Health insurance Money Money in Harry Potter Exchange rate Hydrogen economy Insurance Nuclear power Welding Tariff Balassa-Samuelson effect Software patent debate Capital accumulation Goodness and value theory Monetary policy Value Publicly funded medicine Ra (board game) Public policy Economics Economy of Russia Toyota Camry Unemployment Common Agricultural Policy Strategic management Roman currency Opportunity cost Arguments for and against drug prohibition Surplus value Free trade Supply and demand Paintball Public good Professional wrestling slang Commodity markets Heckscher-Ohlin model Gambling FairTax Great Depression Bass guitar Philatelic investment Airline Technocratic movement Bicycle lighting Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Energy development Horseshoe Economy of the Republic of Ireland Poker jargon Pitaten Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Gold Exchange value Gold as an investment Prices of production Public transport Theory of conduct 2000 Australian Grand Prix Aldi Capitalism Monopoly Estoppel Uranium Final Fantasy XI MMORPG Mutual fund Keynesian economics United States dollar John McDouall Stuart Farthing (coin) Horse Bond Graduate school Canadian and American health care systems compared Equine conformation Bretton Woods system Value added tax Canadian and American economies compared Transformation problem Floppy disk Book collecting Internal ballistics Diamond Famine Privatization Price School of Salamanca Natural monopoly

has anyone seen an abscess in a horse's hoof that was so bad they were no longer using their leg almost looked like the leg was broken after it was drained it got much better doing better daily how long does this take to get that bad just curious she wasn't in my care when it happened when we found out she got taken to the vet asap just didn't know how common this was currently doing epsom salt soaks and a epsom poultice the vet gave us a hoof abscess can be one of the scariest things a horse owner may witness one day the owner walks into the stable to visit his beloved horse and behold the horse appears lame refusing to place any weight on a specific leg the owner tries to walk him a bit and meets with minimal or zero success often the horse responds as if you asked him to walk on a broken leg chances are your horse's leg is fine and the problem exists within his hoof a problem that is painful as heck for the horse but almost always clears itself out without health risks or long term damage an abscess can occur when the hoof develops an infection due to the sole being pierced by a sharp object such as a nail the hoof wall cracks generally due to improper trimming or hoof neglect thereby allowing a piece of gravel to enter and become ingrained within the sensitive tissue above the sole the laminae damage is done to the corium due to factors such as decreased blood circulation from shoes poor horse shoeing and or trimming etc such damage has often existed internally for a while and only starts being released when a horse is allowed barefoot and thereby sees increased circulation other less common factors can cause a hoof abscess and sometimes due to the location of the abscess the cause or point of origin won't even be able to be detected when your horse develops an abscess what happens is purulent fluid pus collects as the body fights off the source of the infection since the hoof cannot expand to accommodate the increasing collection of pus the increased pressure within the hoof causes a great degree of pain so who can blame your horse for not wanting to walk on such a foot the pus will attempt to escape via the easiest path within the hoof which most often is the coronary band if a hoof wall is weakened or contains a crack it's possible for the abscess to develop there instead once the abscess drains the pus from the horse's hoof the infection generally ends and your horse becomes just fine while an abscess can heal on its own i do not recommend allowing it to do so as an abscess can be incredibly painful for your horse and without human intervention the healing process will take significantly longer once you have determined your horse likely has a hoof abscess place a call to an expert a veterinarian or blacksmith just make sure they are familiar with how to handle abscesses in most cases the expert will test the hoof to detect the point of origin then cut a small hole to allow the fluid to drain quicker sometimes if the infection cannot be isolated or is caught too deeply in the hoof the expert will not cut the hoof since cutting away too much can do far more harm than good luckily most abscesses can successfully be expedited after your hired expert has diagnosed the problem and provided whatever remedy he could you will need to keep the sensitive hoof as clean and protected as possible it's recommended you soak the hoof many use water with a touch of apple cider vinegar and clean the infected area thoroughly before covering the small drill hole with cotton or bandages you want to ensure dirt and manure cannot find their way into the hole and sensitive tissues if a drain hole was unable to be added then chances are the abscess will need to escape via the coronary band this will be a slower and more painful process for the horse but unfortunately there's no way around it a poultice created from linseed mash has been said to soften the hoof band as well as increase blood circulation so if your horse's abscess must heal on its own give this poultice a try it may help speed up the process and alleviate some of the pain a linseed poultice is created by boiling linseeds into a mash which is then spread across the abscessed hoof and wrapped remember to soak the hoof with the water and cider vinegar solution once daily until the abscess appears to have drained completely since exercise increases blood circulation taking your horse for a walk daily can also speed up the draining process not that your horse will be thrilled with the prospect at first if your horse is generally shod and then is allowed to go barefoot he will have an increased chance of developing an abscess since the hoof has likely been weakened depending on how long the horse has been shoed in addition shod horses are more likely to develop an abscess due to the nail holes etc while an abscess can be painful for a horse and thus painful for us as we empathize with him as long as you act promptly then chances are the healing process can be expedited and resolved relatively quickly  Psoriasis Prostate cancer Breastfeeding Diabetes mellitus Myocardial infarction Cancer

something is wrong with his eye okay so my horse has had this eye problem for a year now at first i thought something got in it like sawdust or something then it started to have those eye booger things like we get but there was a lot of it and liquid would come out with it even some blood so the vet flushes it out every weeks it has gotten better now it still has the eye boogers but doesnt bleed it is very cloudy we have him on steroids and some other stuff we put in his food he cant see well out of it either it isnt the thing when his nose is clogged up and it comes out his eye b c we have seen atleast vets we may remove it if it gets worse so any suggestions on what it is would be great right now we use clean paper towels to wipe his eye everyday his right eye only have you considered moon blindness eru we had a mare come to us that suffered from it and it too got so bad that we nearly had her eye removed her symptoms sound the same the most common signs are puffy watering eyes squinting and red blood vessels at the sides of the eye and in the lids horses will often be photophobic very sensitive to the sun and often to any light in some eyes you can notice a white cloudiness or a blue or green tint another major sign to look for is a pupil that is constricted when the horse is in the barn or a darkened stall a constricted pupil indicates that it is in spasm and is very painful immediate treatment is needed to alleviate the spasm other signs may include head shaking a runny nose white spots or bleeding in the eye matter or pus collecting loss of balance tripping running into things or rubbing the eye in some cases if you look across the surface of the eye you may even see ulcers they look like little declivities but usually you will need to stain the eye to see them and the untrained eye can still miss them we used atropine to keep the eye dilated and prevent the spasms and banamine for pain when it got severe she had a catheter inserted into her eye for drops and other meds to be applied which made life easier there are various causes from flu and herpes to allergies i strongly suggest you get someone out there that has dealt with eru before and get her on appropriate treatment  Asthma Diabetic retinopathy Traumatic brain injury Common cold Dialysis Chronic fatigue syndrome Stroke Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Eye Cephalic disorder Migraine Allergy Intracranial pressure Acne Mouth ulcer Urinary incontinence Multiple sclerosis First aid Conjunctivitis Pneumonia Rosacea Psoriasis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Narcotic Bleeding Sewage treatment Sun Tattoo Cat Diarrhea Myocardial infarction Stomach cancer Herpes simplex virus Gonorrhoea Pupil Guinea pig Charles Darwin's illness Red eye (medicine) Milton H.

does anyone have diagrams instructions on how to harness a miniature horse to a pony cart or sulky i drove a vis a vis carriage for a carriage company years ago recently i have been volunteering at a theraputic riding stable they have a small pony cart and a miniature horse that has pulled it before they want me to work the horse to get it ready for a parade to raise awareness of their center driving no problem remembering different types of rigging small problem we tried today and it seemed other volunteers may have pieced rigging together and mislaid pieces the diagrams were a great reminder thanks i think i see where we were having problems now we were also missing a part on the cart it was loaned out and not returned with everything we had a rigging without a saddle and it allowed the carriage to bump into the horse the correct rigging was too small for the horse i think we will have to either find a way to make it larger for him or not drive him taking a larger rigging for a different type of carriage and scaling it down obviously didn't work harness the single horse safely and comfortably http www ponyandcarriage co uk pdf documents public harnessing the single horse safely and comfortably pdf measurements for a bridle harness http www nikkisponyexpress net measurementsa html this site has a very good image with the parts labled here is a very bad video of someone putting one on http www youtube com watch v odunl z a a little bit more http www discover horse carriage driving com harnessing html  Horse tack Horse Sulky HyperText Transfer Protocol World Wide Web Chariot Carriage Cowboy Strap-on dildo Harness racing Saturn V Energy development Tire Cart Working animal Jet engine Rigging Uniform Resource Locator Web browser Human animal roleplay (BDSM) Welsh Cob (Section D) Industrial Revolution Wget Mars Exploration Rover Cross site scripting Cascading Style Sheets SAML XHTML Bridle Pony Internet Bicycle Web server HTTP cookie Theory of conduct Uniform Resource Identifier Representational State Transfer HTML Website Transmission Control Protocol Bicycle frame Ajax (programming) Rail terminology Captain Thunderbolt Jackass: The Movie Arabian horse Drill bit Phishing Milton H.

whjy are people under the impression that a horse has to be at least before it is broke yes i agree no heavy jumping barrel racing etc should be done before but racehorses are broke when they are y o and the majority end up fine many of those who don't are only bad because of a racing accident that could happen to a y o horse we use ott off the track racehorses as the barn i ride for hunter jumper and they were broke at and they are still extremely active jumping at ages over jennifer if you are under the impression that we drug our horses you are sadly mistaken our horses recieve nothing but water treats sweet feed hay and in lisa i am a bit confused are you with me on this question or against me s lisa thanks fo rclearing that up yo horse as i already mentioned racing accidents that happen to year olds can just as easily happen to or year olds horsejumper you are going to be wasting your breath because most people are uniformed when talking about racing etc and they read some blurb or watch pharlap and then every tb that has ever seen a track has been brutalized drugged etc most tb's that will be flat horses are broken as yearlings but are actually started right before their yr old year it's no different for polo ponies reiners wp etc wp show weanlings on longe line but i don't see half as many complaints or criticisms leveled at them tb's that will go national hunt hurdles or chasing are not usually started until or in both cases if the horse is backward or immature for it's age they are turned away for another months year whatever everyone assumes that every tb foal that hits the ground will be broken and raced as a year old and that is simply not true i find it so frustrating having to explain this to people it's also true that a lot of the injuries that they sustain such as bowed tendons suspensories etc are just as common in reining polo jumping etc as they are in racing i have been involved in racing all my life my father was a steeplechase jockey and now trains i have worked the majority of my life within the racing industry and the fact that people claim all the horses are drugged etc is a bit rude doping and other such cheat tactics are present in all horse sports the racing industry is more heavily regulated than any other equine sport from animal welfare medications race fixing jockey riding and conduct trainer practices everything is scrutinized while i appreciate that not everyone likes racing i do think that people should know a little more about what goes on from personal experience rather making big sweeping blanket statements such as every tb is broken as a yearling  Horse racing Thoroughbred Thoroughbred horse race Steeplechase Show jumping Seabiscuit Parachuting Jockey Ben Johnson (athlete) Athletics Show hunter Milton H.

is this horse o k i went searching for horses for sale and i looked at a mare that had a filly months ago and she looks really bony in the hips and a little skinny if i buy her will this be a good horse for a beginer as others said you'll need to ride the horse first before actually purchasing to test if the horse is good natured or not the fact that she's had a filly is inconsequential to what her actual temperament is ask the owners what level of rider this horse would be good with then ask if you can test ride her get a vet out to check her health as well and consider things carefully many mares lose a little weight when supporting a foal but they can gain it back easily with good care and good feeding  Horse Equine conformation Eventing Arabian horse Horse gait Sunday Silence Sunline Seabiscuit Captain Thunderbolt Dressage Cross-country equestrianism Horses of Middle-earth Horseshoe Pet skunk Akhal-Teke Horse tack Selle Fran__ais Mattress Guinea pig Donkey Breeders' Cup Dog Japan Cup High-heeled shoe Show hunter Hippogriff Sin City Life insurance All Along Epsom Derby Lipizzan Science Trademark Traveller (horse) Horse breaking Ruffian (horse) Turkoman Horse Short selling Labrador Retriever Fancy rat Livestock Conditions races Microchip implant (animal) Gross domestic product Neopets FairTax Thoroughbred Nashua (horse) Clydesdale (breed) Bicycle helmet Scientology beliefs and practices Might and Power Ecco the Dolphin Foie gras Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Northerly Exceller Dragon Booster Hamster Connemara pony Microeconomics German Shepherd Dog Makybe Diva Altruism Man O' War (horse) Welsh Cob (Section D) Przewalski's Horse Oldenburg (horse) Rising Fast Organic food Nine Inch Nails Martial art Money Cowboy The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess Charisma (horse) Melbourne Cup Preakness Stakes Bicycle lighting Sleipnir LiveJournal Recumbent bicycle Billboard Hot 100 Species Fox hunting Shaggy dog story Philadelphia Phillies Cox Plate Pat Day Tour de France Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Twin City Rapid Transit Clinical depression Entei (InuYasha) Inflation Milk Dog training Spanish Riding School Seattle Slew

why do people use open front boots on their horse why do people use running martingales people at my barn use running martingales and open front boots but i don't know why open front boots are tendon boots that's how they all looked before sports medicine boots came along they protect the tendons and ligaments at the back of the leg from striking etc a running martingale is an artificial training aid that is used to prevent a horse getting it's head too far up in the air they are also helpful when working on a horses form and topline some horses don't like tie downs or standing martingales because they are so restrictive and a running one places pressure onto the reins not the nose running martingales are also used when people intend to jump as standing martingales and ties downs should never used when jumping as they prevent the horse from stretching out it's head and neck over a fence  Equine conformation Horse Martingale (tack) Horse tack Horse gait Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling attacks Anterior cruciate ligament Noseband Diving Humerus Elbow-joint Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Cowboy Show hunter Bridle Professional wrestling throws Hunt seat Mixed martial arts Dressage Radius (bone) Scapula Diving suit Skateboarding trick Pittsburgh Steelers Japan Cup Boston Red Sox Fencing Glossary of American football Obedience training Show jumping Piledriver (professional wrestling) Massage Belmont Park Volleyball Knee Carpal tunnel syndrome Pedro Mart__nez Arabian horse Glossary of climbing terms Hip (anatomy) Powerbomb Figure skating Recruit training Cowboy boot Spanking Fielding (cricket) DDT (professional wrestling) Chair Suicide methods Goaltender Drowning Northerly Metacarpus John F.

my friends horse got loose in the stallion pen my friend's horse was in her pasture and she was in heat she was in teh pasture next the the stallion and during the night he kicked the gate open and she went in there we found her in the morning with marks in the same place on both sides of her and a hude swell mark on her shoulder what do you think happened we have no clue possabily bred to it's pretty obvious that she was covered mounted by the stallion and very possibly bred but whether or not she is pregnant is something the vet will have to determine in a few weeks the swelling is from where she was bitten by the stallion as he was holding her still for breeding in the future your friend should be more mindful to keep her mare away from an intact stallion while she's in heat  Horse Lipizzan Karabakh Charisma (horse) Equine conformation Trakehner Thoroughbred Morgan horse Oldenburg (horse) Pony of the Americas Akhal-Teke Guinea pig Selective breeding Hackney (horse) Domestication of the horse Arabian horse John Lennon Smarty Jones Holstein (horse) Gray (horse) Oasis (band) Hinny Connemara pony Chocobo Sunday Silence Welsh Cob (Section D) The Lone Ranger Social rule Mule Bullfighting Przewalski's Horse Horses of Middle-earth Seabiscuit Hanoverian (horse) Selle Fran__ais Pegasus Tennessee Walker United Kingdom horse-racing Welsh pony of cob type (Section C) Livestock Welsh pony (Section B) Welsh mountain pony (Section A) Dressage Harness racing Dole Gudbrandsdal Clydesdale (breed) Rugby union Keeneland Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Japan Cup Svadilfari Trish Stratus Avalanche Obstetrics EastEnders Donkey Cat Hay Canadian Football League Jean Grey Minor Harry Potter Beasts Kimi Finster Pony Eddie Guerrero Barb (horse) Willie Nelson The Black Stallion American Saddlebred Sleipnir Dartmoor pony Opportunity rover Swingout Cattle Jeopardy!

suspensory never having dealt with a suspensory injury before i'm not sure what to expect in any case it started about two weeks ago as a hot swollen spot on her right foreleg around the tendons about midway up the lower leg we stayed off her back to see if it would go away and got the vet to come out two days later he ultrasounded it and what do you know she'd blown her suspensory following his instructions we poulticed it for three days on the fourth day we put her out in a smaller paddock by herself by then the swelling had gone down almost entirely and was no longer hot to the touch for three days she was doing just dandy then i went out to see her this morning and the entire lower leg was swollen and hot not just the spot that had been so i wrapped her front legs and put her back in her stall when i went to check on her tonight that leg was slightly more swollen even than it had been that morning so i re wrapped the legs and put her up once again and the vet's coming out again tomorrow anyway the point of all this even though the vet will give us the medical explanation tomorrow i hope why would her entire leg have blown up all of a sudden after four days of little to no swelling don't worry i learned the wrap both legs lesson the first time i dealt with splints dmso good idea i didn't think of that and i even have some sitting on a shelf we dealt frequently with suspensory injuries in polo we cold hosed the leg for mins times per day and then sweated the leg at night using nitrofurazone and dmso you can also wrap the legs during the day with clay or ice tight i'm sure that you are aware of this but when you wrap the affected leg put a support bandage on the other as that one will be bearing more weight as with any ligament injury reducing inflammation is key to healing along with rest i wouldn't turn her out i'd hand walk her she may have simply re injured it they can take some time to heal especially if they are torn or have a hole in them all it takes is a simple twist and you are back where you started  Equine conformation Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling throws Aerial (dance move) Carpal tunnel syndrome Anterior cruciate ligament Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Skateboarding trick The Contender (television series) 1957 World Series Radiation therapy New York Giants Swingout Paragliding Swimming Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Poker jargon Casualty lifting Ocean's Twelve Water polo Traumatic brain injury Seabiscuit First aid Horse gait The Amber Spyglass Chair Milton H.

how can i take horse riding from a hobby to my life i have decided to have a career in horses and go to a horse university i am but have been rding for only three years besides majorly increasing my personal fitness what else can i do to make my horse riding skills increase and start thinking of competing and having lseeons at least twice a week aswell i will obviously increasing my horsemanship skills as hopefully i will be getting my own horse next halfway through next year during my gap year any tips besides the fact that i will be poor forever thank you in adavnce for taking my question seriously you mentioned that you'll be taking a gap year spend that year immersed in the horse world mostly during your lessons especially if they're group ones like mine think about things that you can improve for example when you're warming up at the walk see how far you can stretch your heels down and at the trot and canter drop your stirrups for one lap and pick them back up for another this increases your leg strength and balance and it helps you practice picking up a lost stirrup at the more jostling gaits don't just stick to the discipline you're riding now find lessons in western if you're riding english now and vice versa spend some time learning about every nook and cranny of the riding styles out there even if it's just a lesson or two or if it's just reading about it in a book this way your that much more knowledgeable about different riding styles horsemanship training methods and riding in general see if you can spend time with a trainer you can learn about different training methods and hopefully pick up things that you can use later on many professional riders also train to keep up the bills before they get that breakout ride see if you can get a job as a groom at a well known showing barn in your area this way you can be in the competition environment and gain the mindset you'll also gain contacts and references for later but i'm assuming you know that this pays nothing which brings me to my last almost xd point find a job in retail etc that you know a little bit about even if you work part time it helps bring in the money i would even go so far as to recommend that you save everything that you get from that job ok last thing save i know it's so obvious but it's necessary eat mac and cheese and ramen noodles don't buy new clothes live at home go to the extreme if you're buying a horse months before you go to college you've got a double whammy of new costs coming your way i told you everything that i could think of because you didn't mention what you want to go into pro rider trainer wow all this talk about horses makes me want to take a gap year myself hmm might have to consider it d  Dressage Horse gait Horse Cowboy Horse tack Equine conformation Milton H.

whats that stuff called you use it to bring down swelling in like legs of horses its yellow and you rub it in the area thats swollen i think its call something sweat she has a swollen hock so wraping is hard the vet just told me to put this stuff on her but i forgot whats it called is there another gel that sounds like furzone the yellow stuff is furazone and unless this is mixed with something like traumeel or dmso or used as a sweat it's not going to bring swelling down on its own furazone is a protective antibiotic cream not all that different from neosporin basically poultice a whitish gray clay is used to help reduce swelling also in conjuction with a wrap either a plain standing bandage or a sweat wrap a regular standing bandage can help prevent stocking up and it can help reduce swelling a sweat is a specific leg wrapping that is used to decrease swelling this usually comprises of dmso furazone traumeel surpass or poultice either one of these things or a combination spread liberally onto the leg then covered with a damp brown paper bag that has been previously cut to the same size as a quilt wrap then plastic wrap this is optional but beneficial to actually create the sweat that draws the fluid out especially when used with dmso this wrap is then followed by a standing bandage a quilt bandage a hock can still be wrapped it's not as easy but it can be done however the horse needs to tolerate it if the horse kicks around it will do more damage than not furazone's proper name is nitrofurazone perhaps this is what your vet was referring to it as but nothing else comes to mind that is yellow and has zone in it  Equine conformation Hydrotherapy Mattress Clothing Skateboarding trick First aid kit Psoriasis Volleyball Jute Professional wrestling holds Intravenous therapy Teen Girl Squad Dialysis Mosquito Sanitary towel Fancy rat Herpes simplex virus Naruto jutsu Pottery Ice cream Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sin City Undergarment Dairy Tattoo Aerial (dance move) Bong Corrosion Cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Collecting fossils Comanche Action potential Redundant array of independent disks Welding Genericized trademark Tooth enamel Methylsulfonylmethane Bagel Pneumonia Acne Textile manufacturing Hyperthermia Glossary of American football Cellulitis Fecal incontinence Anchor Professional wrestling attacks Time Out of Mind Knitting Gout Violin M16 (rifle) Tobacco Cricket ball Glossary of climbing terms Giraffe Dog training Chair Bleeding Radiation therapy Mixed martial arts Traumatic brain injury Carpal tunnel syndrome Fire fighting Boxing Safe sex Suplex Intracranial pressure Mouse (computing) Friction Leprosy Gypsy moth Snakebite (bite) Soap bubble Diving suit Plastic Upholstery Wound Poker jargon Multiple sclerosis Drill bit Aloe Dog Otitis externa Seismometer Kitab al-I'tibar Hiking Bullet Electrophysiology Spider Naval mine Japanese cuisine Goomba Etching Illegal drug trade

horse with heaves my year old mare has heaves started years ago and this year we had to start her on dex and now we switched to prednisone she seems to have the most problems if the grass gets high so we keep it mowed short any advice or tips to help her to remain comfortable would be great my vet says just to keep doing what i'm doing but it's breaking my heart thanks yeah i don't want her on the steroids long term i will definately ask my vet about the inhalers and the syrup she did really well til about weeks ago and she suddenly started coughing and wheezing really bad scared me to death it's somewhat under control now with cc's dex a day hopefully we can go to something without all of these sideeffects thanks she is outside all day really rural area in fl this time of year they have so much grass they don't even touch the hay but when they do eat it we soak it while we are at work she seems to only have this problem during the summer thanks for your help keeping the seed heads from the bahia mowed down definately helps too much grass right now no need for hay this only occurs in the summer dust doesn't seem to bother her because earlier this year before all of the rain they were plowing up the acres across the street dust everywhere and she didn't start coughing only weeks later after the rain and the seed heads came up is when this started again really stinks she my first horse for managing copd you should effectively stop feeding hay because pasture kept horses that have been fed hay still show inflamed lungs and airways days afterwards even though they are outside you can get products such as horsehage which is almost like silage without the risk of botulism another is mollichaff if you must feed it it needs to be soaked for hours prior to feeding and be fed wet do not allow it to hang and dry otherwise you have defeated the purpose if she has to be stalled she should be on peat or paper and hay and straw should not be stored near her stall ventopulmin or any bronchodilator can ease the rasping and open the airways the use of azium or prednisone stops the body's inflammatory response to the allergens dust etc usually with copd you start with a several day high dose and then drop back to a maintenance dose which they take long term we've had mares on low dose steroid maintence and they have had no adverse effects and it has helped their breathing it's no different to children with asthma they have an albuterol inhaler or other bronchodilator and then they take advair or singular which is a steroid for maintenance my son is and been on singular for years with great results the low dose steroids really can make a difference and improve quality of life and reduce the number of attacks i would not rule out steroid therapy until you discuss it with the vet because imagine what it must be like not to be able to breath and feel your airways closing up although you may be opposed to steroids consider what the vet says and if it's going to make the basic function of breathing easier for her  Allergy Salbutamol Hay Glucocorticoid Guinea pig Anabolic steroid Psoriasis Equine conformation Acute respiratory distress syndrome Drowning Pneumonia Radiation therapy Cystic fibrosis Eczema Rebreather Breastfeeding Fire fighting Urinary incontinence Growth hormone treatment Lung cancer Insulin Bong Bronchoconstriction Hypoglycemia First aid Folic acid Carbon dioxide Mattress Tobacco Diving regulator Air pollution Dairy Botulism Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Ionizing radiation Sorghum Health issues and the effects of cannabis Domestic rabbit Aspergillosis Textile manufacturing Diabetes mellitus Hydrogen sulfide Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Multiple sclerosis Clinical depression Tobacco smoking Cocaine Growth hormone deficiency Prostate cancer Swimming Omega-3 fatty acid Cancer Bronchiolitis Liquid breathing Chronic fatigue syndrome Paracetamol The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Weather lore Weight training Chernobyl accident Aspartame Cannabis (drug) Puberty Chicken Atherosclerosis Crohn's disease Gastroesophageal reflux disease The Amber Spyglass Sarcoidosis Nuclear fallout Haloalkane Nutmeg Pulmonary alveolus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Opioid Bird migration Immunosuppressive drug Atkins Nutritional Approach Maize Migraine Drug abuse Carnivorous plant Toilet humour Decompression sickness Cannabis cultivation Ultimate (sport) Yarrow Thermal power station Mesothelioma

my horse show i am entering a horse show and i am nervous i am competing against my sister and we are both competitive so there is no point of trying to tell me 'just have fun ' last horse show i only placed second because the other girl's horse refused the same girl is entering and i don't think i'll be lucky enough to have her pony refuse my sister hasn't gotten to ride the horse she rides since tuesday after their big fall i've gotten to ride my mount though her mount june has been in her stall for two days i'm nervous but i think i can beat her we have been teasing each other of whose gonna win and now i don't think it's me and i do at the same time help stop freaking out about who will win if your sister had a big fall don't put on the pressure to push herself if she may be a bit low on confidence please don't brag to her or anyone else hoping the best rider's horse will refuse is not good sportsmanship she earned it if she is a good rider she took the time to perfect that all you can do is be a good sport practice all you can then the last day before the show go on a trail ride and relax just make sure at the show to be relaxed and see if you don't get the ribbon you still learned something that could always be improved don't put all that pressure on yourself about how you are going to be the best and win the blue ribbon if you have that additude of a push button pony snob then i suggest getting an additude change be glad that you are competing and the worst you can do is be nervous your horse can sense it and it will refuse and act up just do your best and you'll suceed in some way p s just second that is really good i haven't gotten a second place ribbon yet but are there only three people in your riding classes  Horse Equine conformation Show jumping Horse show Tour de France Milton H.

horse question about bell boots bell boots are for jumping and i have seen people put them on when they are not jumping and going out on a hack and leave them on when they put the horse pony in its field why do they do that if the horse treads it's shoes off or wears egg bars you turn them out in bell boots to help keep the shoes on also some horses don't track up correctly when they are ridden and their hind feet strike the bulbs of the heels so they put them on when riding we used them for polo for both reasons stopping them treading off their shoes and to stop them striking  Horse Equine conformation Shoe Footwear Horse gait Show jumping Horse tack High-heeled shoe Tennessee Walker Boot Horseshoe Hunt seat Shoe fetishism Motorcycle Marching band Cowboy Stairway Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Dressage Snowboard Professional wrestling attacks Snowboarding Skateboarding trick Punt (boat) Saint Nicholas Figure skating 1957 World Series Sock Show hunter Pony Dr. Martens Water polo Caligula Rail terminology Roller skating Foot Ski Ski binding Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Slipper Obedience training Curling Shoemaking Diving Shaggy dog story Goomba Cowboy boot Sin City Skinhead Volleyball Mario Royal Canadian Mounted Police Horses of Middle-earth Disneyland Drag racing Telemark skiing Athletics Glossary of partner dance terms Aerial (dance move) Tap dance Irish dance Recumbent bicycle Kitesurfing Kurt Angle Only Fools and Horses Tire Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics Operation Barbarossa Foot odor Connemara pony Softball Dog agility Paul Is Dead Swingout GunZ The Duel Polo Grounds Artistic roller skating Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Super Mario Bros. 3 Bull riding Horse show Non-native pronunciations of English Laminitis Booting Battles of Lexington and Concord Comanche Sonic the Hedgehog Platform shoe Stocking Parachuting Kick Battle of Waterloo Witch-king of Angmar Sitting Bull Spanking My Little Chickadee Mega Man X3 Customs and etiquette of Japan Inline skates

can somebody explain american horse names please usa horses registered names are always really long and often have 'bar' or other such in them why is this does it explain the pedigree or are americans just keen on long names breeds like the american quarter horse are often named for the ranch they were bred from or the names of their ancestors the name bar comes up alot because there are many quarter horse stallions named things like doc bar zippo pine bar who is out of zippo pat bar who is out of three bars these two stallions alone seem like they are in almost every quarter horses pedigree at some point alot of the time as more horses are bred at a breeding barn they will keep using variations of the parents names combined with new words since there are so many horses registered with the aqha it is hard to come up with a short name that isn't already taken also using the names of a horses relatives gives a good idea what that horse was bred for for instance if you have a horse with poco in its name you know that horse is most likely bred for cutting cow work if you have a horse with impressive in its name you know it is halter bred  Horse Thoroughbred Equine conformation American Quarter Horse Appaloosa Arabian horse Domestication of the horse Domestication Species Icelandic horse Selective breeding Mixed-breed dog Akhal-Teke Selle Fran__ais American Paint Horse Docking Bullfighting Dog show Horse gait Smarty Jones Morgan horse Sunday Silence Cattle Guns, Germs, and Steel Breed registry American Kennel Club Jack Russell Terrier Barb (horse) Dole Gudbrandsdal Musical terminology Hybrid American Saddlebred Cowboy Chinese character Man O' War (horse) Billy the Kid Milton H.

how can i make my horse relax his head when ridden its always so high i want him to ruck his chin in chest any teeth issues aside you may be causing the problem and not realizing it a lot of people will hang on a horses mouth to get the head down and this in turn really causes the head to go up since there is not relief in it you need to keep your hands low and apply pressure in a see saw motion of left right left right when you horse gives his head even just a little stop his figures out that when the head goes down he gets relief it will take a bit but each time you should be able to bring the head a little lower and your horse should be able to keep it there a little longer you really do not want your horse to tuck his chin on his chest since this can cause him to ride behind the bit instead aim for a nice level topline good luck  Equine conformation Professional wrestling holds Horse tack Drill bit Professional wrestling attacks Boxing Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Professional wrestling throws Horse Aerial (dance move) Breaststroke Angina Motorcycle Fast bowling Tai Chi Chuan Gag (BDSM) Embouchure Drowning Gesture Social rule 2000 Australian Grand Prix Dressage Rebreather Mouse (computing) Captain Thunderbolt Shaggy dog story Noseband Diving First aid Spacecraft propulsion Car handling Wyatt Earp Diving regulator Piccolo Junior Saga Breastfeeding Archery Horseshoe Suplex Myocardial infarction Rugby union positions Woodworking Physical attractiveness Show hunter Eyepiece Eventing Shawn Michaels Sin City Circuit breaker Dialysis Singlish Rugby union Evidence of evolution Characters in the Smurfs Cat Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Horse gait Microeconomics Diver rescue Griffon Bruxellois Doom enemies Swingout Acupuncture 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Samuel Goldwyn Salute Traumatic brain injury GunBound Horus Hair Butterfly stroke Spatial disorientation Tooth 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Recumbent bicycle Seabiscuit Chariot Oral sex Theory of conduct Enceladus (moon) Comanche Skateboarding trick Domestication of the horse Human anatomy Tetrapod Ed, Edd n Eddy Anatomical terms of location Horse breaking Vomiting Japanese tea ceremony Martingale (tack) Wood carving Steam engine Milton H.

in a desperate fix for saddle bridle cleaning supplies no saddle soap any household items to substitute would a tiny bit of vegable oil and water and soap make the saddle and bridle look better and be more supple i am very desperate so please don't suggest buying supplies or ordering them this is for all of the people who have recommended murphy's oil soap to you when i lived in nj i worked for a time with a master saddler someone who makes saddles and tack for a living and who spent years as an apprentice learning his craft before he was allowed to work on his own he told me flat out that the worst possible thing that you can do to leather is to use murphy's oil soap on it it ruins it it dries leather out horribly and it will cause it to crack and break with continued usage murphy's also will rot stitching and this is definitely something that you want to avoid especially on things like girths and bridles because your safety depends on them being secure as far as substitutes go you can use a little bit of dish soap in a gallon of water to get the dirt and sweat off and then use something like shoe cleaner most shoe cleaners are made for use on leather and many of them contain the same ingredients as saddle soaps and harness cleaners to condition and preserve the leather once it's clean i would not use noxema that has alcohol in it which strips leather of its moisture and causes drying and cracking make sure that your tack is thoroughly clean and dry before applying the shoe cleaner and use it sparingly a little goes a long way when it comes to this type of product make sure as well that any sponges and towels you use are clean before you start since if they are dirty they can transfer any dirt they contain to the leather you are trying to clean i must admit to being a little curious about your question saddle soaps and cleaners such as horseman's one step are not that expensive to buy and they work much better than most of the remedies suggested so far they certainly are far better for your tack than murphy's is shoe cleaners such as those found in most shoe and sporting good stores will also work but they have to be used in small amounts what makes you so desperate i wonder anyway good luck i hope this helps  Horse tack Leather Upholstery Equine conformation Dry cleaning Mattress Textile manufacturing Shampoo Drill bit Shoe Japanese tea ceremony Eczema Japanese toilet Car washing techniques Menstrual cup Tack Vacuum cleaner Fuel injection Shoe polish Inflation Sento Wok Soap Knife Veganism Strap-on dildo Bulk vending Climbing equipment Welding Solar power Comanche Violin Renewable energy Energy development Charles Goodyear Brewery Vinegar Lionel Corporation Cruising (maritime) Breastfeeding Tattoo Customs and etiquette of Japan Tofu Microeconomics Social rule High-heeled shoe Genericized trademark Clothing Fecal incontinence Soap opera Glossary of climbing terms Dishwasher Hemp Home repair Horse Sulfuric acid Drag racing Gas metal arc welding Sock Skin Thermal power station Bicycle E85 Cross-country skiing Dollar store Egg (food) Urinary incontinence Washing machine Livery Company Keynesian economics Seismic retrofit Alcoholic beverage Laundry detergent Alcoholics Anonymous Motorcycle Diaper Sailing Detergent Coffee Serial Psoriasis Plastic Illegal drug trade Ammonia Dishwashing Dialysis Casting Hunt seat Nuclear power Wound Justification (theology) Houseplant First aid Biodiesel Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Economy of the United States

is my mare pregnant hello everybody quick question for ya i bought a new mare a few months ago and she's been changing a little here lately i thought her teets looked a bit big when we got her but they said it was nothing then she started looking a little hollow in her flanks and i thought she needed to gain a little weight well she's on perfect fresh grass as much as she wants and the hollowness in her flanks is getting more pronounced now she has huge veins visible under her belly she is constantly lipping at us and rubbing her head on us for attention and tonight i noticed her teets are looking even a bit bigger when i got ahold of one to see if there was any waxy build up there was milk lots of milk i felt like i was milking a cow her udders aren't getting fuller but she had no shortage she's not getting wide from side to side when i look at her from the front but is there any other reason besides pregnancy for a horse to have milk oh i forgot to mention she's a y o hh percheron supposedly she's never had a foal before and i have no reason to believe the man i bought her from lied about that or anything else he told me about her if she's bred it's most likely with an american spotted draft that's just a little bigger than she is if she is pregnant how far from foaling is she considering she's got milk thanks a bunch guys can chaser i'll be calling the vet tomorrow right now it happens to be sunday night there don't seem to be any signs of imminant labor so i don't consider this an emergency thank you for your input but i was just hoping for some answers until i could get ahold of my vet first thing in the morning this is totally unexpected we're unprepared but it's still very exciting nina we paid for her assuming she wasn't pregnant she's extremely quiet and loving a very gentle ride she lives up to the breed expectations of personality guys i'm not milking her like she's a cow lol i was just saying it came squirting out really fast and plentifully in a steady stream i was expecting to see drop of wax not streaming actual milk i know how important colostrum is don't worry i'm not too bad of a beginner it would be my first foal but i've got horse expert friends on the phone with one right now and they'll be here in a moment's notice to help me if i need it i'm just really hoping this means she's pregnant i hope it's not the hormonal thing like the first answerer said i'm too happy and bouncy right now can i'm not upset at your answer at all i know alot of people come on here with the stupidest questions who really need to call the vet and not waste their time here i'm on the phone with a back up vet right now can't get ahold of mine don't think i'll be able to get ahold of mine until tomorrow morning can't get his pager number it very much sounds like your mare is pregnant and due to deliver soon where do you have her a birthing stall should be huge especially for a draft mare it's actually better for the mare to give birth in a pasture with nice grass birth for the mare will either go one of two ways horses almost always birth when your back is turned you may go inside for a minute nap and come out and find a foal that's great if the mare does all the work it's highly unlikely she needs human help however if things do go wrong they usually go horribly wrong for horses get some iodine for the foals umbilical cord spray or dip the umbilical cord as soon as possible after birth with iodine that seals up the cord and prevents the foal from getting an infection traveling through the wet umbilical cord worm your mare after she gives birth her hormone changes are signaling the worms in her gut to grow quickly and get ready to depart her body in mass this is the worms way of immediatly infecting the foal with worms very young foals will eat nibble on their dams manure this is entirely natural and along with worms if the mare is unwormed they are actually helping populate their own guts with very bennificial bacteria your mare is very friendly right now she may not like you at all after the birth of the foal my arab is like that she will follow me around me like a puppy begging me for attention and trying to follow me into the house once a foal hits the ground she hates me and all other humans she will do anything in her power to keep a foal away from humans for the first year of it's life start researching right now about imprinting a foal at birth you have a few hours time frame in which to acomplish this after the foal is born imprinting is basically touching the foal all over and in ways it will be handled as an adult you keep up the touching until the foal relaxes if the foal is tense or trying to pull away you have to keep up the lesson if not you have taught the foal when it's only a few hours old that it can dominate its will over a humans so to imprint that it's ok to have its feet handled i have the foal laying down with it's head in my lap i pull a foot gently to me if the foal tenses or trys to pull away i keep steady pressure until the foal gives in and relaxes firmly with the flat of my hand i slap the bottom of the hoof over and over again this mimic a shoe being nailed on the foal usually jumps a bit but then relaxes and lets this weird person do as they want since the foal knows no better touch the foal everywhere make sure they relax don't forget inside the mouth the bit inside the ears and under the tail if the vet needs to take a temp some time in the horses life you should get something like plastic surveyor's tape usually neon pink or green and go to town marking your fence so the foal will really be able to see the fence line i had a foal run into a barb wire fence and it was born in the middle of a acre field fortunatly it was imprinted so it was totally calm about me helping her out of the fence and she was unharmed if what you use to mark the fence it plastic only leave it up for about a week after that the foal will know the bondaries but may become currious about that plastic stuff and eat it by the way if you have other animals like a dog and the mare has been good with them she may kill them after the foal is born do not just let a smaller animal in with the mare until you are sure of her reaction teach the foal to lead and tie starting the day after birth it is much easier while they are still small to teach a foal to tie and keep the foal safe tie a soft rope around the foals chest just behind its front legs take the end of the rope between the foals front legs and run the end of the rope through the ring on the bottom of the noseband of the foals halter tie the end of the rope you need a long soft rope to do this by the way to a safe imovable object my personal preferance is a very large tree on the mare couldn't pull out the foal may have an abosolute temper tantrum rearing up and even throwing themselves on the ground in a total fit i call this temper tantrum the dead pony act just stand back at a safe distance holding the mares lead rope the foal will quickly tire itself out talk very calmly to it and pet it when the foal is being calm and good even if it's laying on the ground do not speak to it or touch it no reward when its having a fit within a few days you will have a foal that will stand tied safely and this is so important for an adult horse you run the rope around the foals chest and between it's legs for a reason as the foal pulls back and fights the rope the pressure is on the foals chest where it cannot be damaged if you just tie the foal by the halter the foal may injure it's neck in it's struggles since all the pressure will be on the neck instead the number one cause of foal death is leaving a halter on either the mare or the foal foals are very playful and get their legs caught in halters all the time struggle and break their leg don't leave halters on in the pasture or stall don't forget to take pictures on the legal side the person who sold you the mare may be financially responsible for the foal since they sold you a mare which was not pregnant make sure the mare has a salt mineral block she need's it lot's of fresh water and plenty of good food do not overgrain her she does not need more grain right now hope some of this info helps you garnet homesteading farming over years horse owner for over years  2000

horse riding i wounder how much time in average would someone take from zero to be a good horse rider i guess it would also depend not only upon the rider the horse the instructor but also what you define good as if you define good as olympic level grand prix jumper or world class level reiner etc then consider that most of theeeeee top riders have ridden every day of their lives since their early childhood and have ridden many horses per day this is best chance of learning riding more than one horse getting that vast experience it is what will get you over the bumps and get you to learn your trade better ride many horses a day and in years or so you'll probably be a top competitor with quality instruction and the right horses of course if you consider good a person who can go from not knowing anything to being able to properly ride through a walk trot canter and basically build a safe enough level of skill to go out and enjoy themselves on a trail or something like that i would say that this goal would probably be acheivable in months with the right instruction the right horse and regular lessons at least a week  Horse Dressage Eventing Equine conformation Hunt seat Show jumping Dog agility Snowboarding Seabiscuit Cross-country equestrianism Equitation Parachuting Show hunter Bicycle Tennessee Walker Tour de France Scientology beliefs and practices Cowboy Battles of Lexington and Concord Road bicycle racing Education in the People's Republic of China Kitesurfing Paragliding Education Individual time trial Horse tack Eddy Merckx Species Literacy Roller coaster High jump BASE jumping Trail Alexander Technique Japanese tea ceremony Skateboarding trick Rolex Kentucky Three Day Motorcycle Valentino Rossi Army Cadet Force 2000 Summer Olympics Norway national football team Mountain bike Standardbred horse Volleyball Horse breaking Lucinda Green Mike Smith (jockey) Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Icelandic horse Arabian horse Steve Backley Milton H.

how do you train your horse to come to his name i own a y o paint gelding named howdy and i was wondering how i can teach him to come to his name when i call him thanx i did this with one horse that i got tired of chasing down in the field this is much easier with a horse that's really food motivated work in a round pen or a paddock somewhere where he is loose but can't get too far away from you have a bag of small yummy treats that he can eat quickly bits of apple and carrot work for most horses the yummier the better keep an eye out for nippy behavior since you are using treats a firm no and turning away helps keep that under control don't use his name for this trick since you say that all the time pick a word or a whistle i don't whistle very well so i used come in say the word and hand him a treat do it again do it again take a couple of steps back and say the word again when he comes to you looking to see if you have more treats give him a treat and a pat repeat until you think you're going to lose your mind slowly working out further and further away give him the word wait until he walks over and give him the treat if he stops responding move in close and start over if he is practically crawling into your lap and won't move away long enough for you to try it take a break never give him a treat if he's being rude or pushy that's just teaching him to bully you for treats make sure to stop on a good note you'll need to do this a couple of different days in the pen and make sure he really has the idea don't try it in the field until you're sure he's going to respond try from about twenty feet away the first time then forty it will take a couple of weeks but you get a really reliable response this way i would stand on the fence and yell allen come in and the beast would come thundering in made all of my friends very jealous  Dog training Horse Tag Social rule Indianapolis 500 Aerial (dance move) 1957 World Series Piccolo Junior Saga Russian joke Shaggy dog story Battles of Lexington and Concord New York Giants The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Spidey Super Stories Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) The Apprentice 2 Wyatt Earp Customs and etiquette of Japan Fecal incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 2000 Australian Grand Prix Time Out of Mind One Piece minor characters Dragon Booster Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Equine conformation Ben Johnson (athlete) Hamster Seabiscuit Little Britain Eddie Guerrero Skateboarding trick Paintball Timon and Pumbaa Japanese tea ceremony Glossary of partner dance terms Captain Thunderbolt Shining Time Station Dog agility Norway national football team Ocean's Twelve The Invisibles Spanking Columbine High School massacre Stuttering Highway 61 Revisited Marching band The Contender (television series) Sin City Death Note Knots Landing Swingout Dairy Cleveland Browns Fencing Contredanse Father's Day (Doctor Who) Sub-Zero Comanche Baseball Ron and Fez Kender Scientology beliefs and practices Ranma __ characters New York City Subway Glossary of American football Ayrton Senna Jon Secada Alexander Technique EastEnders Logo programming language The Jim Rome Show Full Metal Panic?

would video taping myself riding help i have no pictures and no tapes of myself riding except for about two months after i first started a couple of the other girls at the barn have told me it can really help to see what you're doing wrong and correct yourself especially with some of the posture problems i have should i bother or not it seems like a bit of a pain and if it wouldn't help i don't want to bother i ride with a trainer and anywhere from one to three other girls and all of us make sure to help the others correct their mistakes so i'm in no way suffering from lack of critique but i still don't improve the little things because i forget them in favor of working on bigger things so people have suggested taping video taping yourself is one of the best tools you can use for improvement in your riding skills you can rewind your ride over and over catching little nuances someone watching you may miss going over rides with a trainer or friend is even better because she he can help you pick out weak areas and help with advice on ways for improvement re taping over and over again daily weekly or at shows will allow you to see how the things you watch and then try to correct from the prior tapes are set into action i highly recommend you going to the trouble of asking someone to help you with video taping in barrel racing it is done regularly for these purposes good luck and hope this helps wish we would have had videos when i started out but believe me i use them still today watching pros in your event is even helpful i never miss an nfr  Social rule Milton H.

is this a confidence issue when i am jumping my h cob i like to go at a slow rythmic pace but when i am riding with my instructor he is really good he always says to go forward but i feel like i am going very very fast and out of control and feel a bit uncomfterble doing it however i get better spots and i have a nicer round around the course i jump ' when i go slow my pace we get ok spots at the fences sometimes really small close and sometimes really really big when i watch the video of me going fast i really dont looks that fast as it seems when im riding him please help if it is a confidence thing please give me tips to get over this it is a confidence issue when your instructor tells you to go forward that means with a controlled strong carriage that gives you and your horse confidence if you aren't ready to go at jumps confidently you should start again at a lower level and focus on you and your horse's controlled strong approach uno come back to ground work with him until you are confident with controlling him at speed work on his forward motion collectively and you both will gain confidence  Equine conformation Horse gait Aerial (dance move) Horse Skateboarding trick Show hunter Quake III Arena Seabiscuit Milton H.

what are the advantages of t touch on horses i would just like to know what t touch does to a horse and how can i do it thank you for your help i myself use t touch all the time on my horse it helps to relax the horse especially before a big and stressful event or even during it i also use it to increase circulation especially when an injury occurs like a pulled tendon to encourage it to heel faster i also use it on any muscle soreness and it usually relaxes it enough to relieve the pressure start by applying light pressure with two or three fingers and move them in a circular motion and each cirlce is never in the same area as the previous onemove up and down the neck and over the whither's and wherever you want to go this technique is also very helpful to get a horse over being headshy or to get them use to you touching any other part of their body that they are unsure of just start a a comfortable place and slowly move your fingers towards his ears and then back down the neck and then back up again each time getting closer to his head until you're on it and then back off again and then proceed farther onto his head and so forth for me it is just a great training tool especially for nervous youngsters and even for other horses too hope this helps  Equine conformation Urinary incontinence Repetitive strain injury Backstroke Breaststroke Professional wrestling holds Reflexology Aikido Horse gait Aerial (dance move) Weight training Eye Sin City Swimming Mixed martial arts Milton H.

new horse with serious issues help my sister and i went to a sales a couple of weeks ago to buy some tack for one of our horses we ended up rescueing a yo thoroughabred gelding he wore a hole in the concrete weaving was stick thin and absolutly covered in cuts and scrapes we've had him for weeks now and he has put on so much weight it's like a new horse he is an absolute sweetheart and gentleman he has been really badly treated if you go near him with a whip he freaks out completly this i can deal with the big problem is the weaving at the moment it's not to bad cause he is out and he will stay out as long as poss but it is likely that he will need stabled overnight for some of the winter and i wanted some ideas on how to help him relax in the stable i have anti weave bars up a mirror for him licks plenty of forage and we are working on making the stable a good place i feed and groom in the box and generally try to give good experiences inside but he is still weaving constantly and excessivly we are at a livery yard with stables rather than a barn so i can't put up a field shelter or make alterations to the stable he is turned out with our other horses one of whom is in the next door stable he can't see cause the walls are too high but he can hear the one next to him he loads right away but as soon as you start moving he freaks out and has managed to damage the trailer floor on the way home despite the floor being almost new and in excellent cond we turn out with rugs as necessary and he won't be clipped this winter cause we are building up his work slowly as he has no muscle at all he could prob be left out all winter but our other horses will have to come in and there is no one else for him to share a field with and he is much worse alone if he is on his own for more than a minute or two he goes mad trying to see other horses this is something we will work on in the future when he has settled a bit more he has an old tendon injury to the back of his hind leg so will have been box rested for an extended period of time so i think this is probably where the weaving comes from as far as i can find out he has never raced although his pedigree is astonishing and he was bred to steeplchase but i have researched his background as much as possible and none of the racing organisations including weatherbys have a record of him every racing before you have to stall him i would start working on the problem now do approach and retreat pay attention as you approach to his thresholds if he starts to get brassy stiff in the body then stop let him stand there for a minute and the moment you sense any relaxation in him whether his head comes down takes a big breath muscles relax then turn and walk away let him rest when he is standing as close to the barn as he can handle keep approaching and retreating till you can bring him closer and closer do this every day till he is comfortable to where he is not feeling the anxiety which is what weaving is caused by anxiety you don't want to try to distract him from that feeling you want to deal with the feeling i don't know if you know the history behind your thoroughbred but i just got yr old given to me and he was at one point used for racing or they tried to how they train them to race is cruel and not o k and it can make an already claustrophobic by nature horse have really bad claustrophobia which when stuck in an enclosed place makes him instead of being and extrovert and flipping out her turns the anxiety inward and starts weaving i'm guessing he has a hard time trailering also will enter perhaps but gets really introverted and perhaps starts weaving there too anyway hoping that this works for you so that you and your horse can just relax  Horse Professional wrestling holds Fecal incontinence Textile manufacturing Skateboarding trick Mattress Swingout Babe Ruth Professional wrestling throws New York Giants Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story Horse gait Glossary of climbing terms Archery Seabiscuit Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Wood carving Drowning Traumatic brain injury Diseases of the honeybee Dairy Dog agility Poker jargon Diving Boxing 2000 Australian Grand Prix Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Jon Secada The Time Machine Hamster The Shining (film) Rathfarnham RuneScape quests Humphrey Bogart Social rule Knife Domestic rabbit First English Civil War Drill bit 1957 World Series Blood on the Tracks Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tire Sydney Riot of 1879 The Empty Child Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Yoga Sutras of Patanjali The Ashlee Simpson Show The Amazing Race M16 (rifle) Battles of Lexington and Concord Action potential Vegeta Anxiety Chair Professional wrestling match types Chatsworth House Fast bowling Terminal ballistics B-47 Stratojet Futurama (TV series -

spooky mare i have owned my mare for over two years now shes a year old cobx she is good in most ways manners etc but she is terribly spooky on the road large vehicles such as lorries and tractors or cars with trailers etc present a big problem she reels backward when she sees them coming spins and tries to run which is obviously very dangerous she just goes into a blind panic and is genuinely terrified considering i have done around of my riding with her on the road for the past two years i would have thought she would have settled in traffic at least a little but she hasnt this is presenting a huge problem as the only roads around the yard to ride on or the roads i have to ride on to get to a bridleway are country lanes and tractors etc are going through there all the time she is often grazed in a field next to a road which i would have also thought would get her used to traffic but doesnt seem to have made much difference any ideas of how i can get her better on the road i often ride with a friend on the road and her horse is perfect in traffic my horse watches him walk past it but it doesnt seem to occur to her that if he can do it she can do it like i said she goes into a blind panic i think she may be a bit claustrophobic because when i pull into a driveway with lots of room to let the tractor or whatever pass she is alot calmer than when she doesnt have much room i dont know alot about her history so i think there may be a chance she has had a bad experience on the road thanks to all for your answers xx well sounds like she is looking for something to give her an excuse to bolt do you ride her daily when a horse stands around for days at a time they get fresh when they just want to play and run they don't want to be serious and safe if you don't ride daily i would suggest giving her a short warm up in the round pen if you have access to one before you make a trip into traffic horse vs car accidents are tragic be safe and until this problem is resolved i would stay out of traffic unless you are hand walking her with a stud chain for leverage this step should be done very slowly and carefully taking the horse only to the edge of the comfort zone and talking gently rubbing her for reassurance there is only one of you and you can't be replaced same for your horse plus you could hurt someone else in their car horses are in nature creatures that would be preyed upon and depending on your horses fight or flight response the traffic bikes and other things could be deemed as threats causing the bolting desensitizing at home with whatever you have available might help but like one of the other posters said seeing the same object over and over made no difference whats that all about i drive my tractor by the horses almost everyday and when the bucket is high one of the mares freaks no matter what but if the bucket is down she doesn't respond at all the horse next to her walks up and watches as i pass by and they are best friends so the buddy theory may or may not work you have to be careful in traffic that's all i'm saying i landed on the pavement many times and luckily was not hurt badly or killed but i have had two friends who were killed while riding on the streets one her horse ran away with her in a field and fell when it hit the pavement killing his rider and it ran back to the stables while her year old daughter watched the other a very street savvy horse rider jumped in front of a big diesel rig killing his rider and leaving nothing but a scratch or two on him so be careful out there that's all i'm saying note came back to this thread and found i had thumbs down for my answer i have to say that bums me out i don't see safety first as being a thumbs down earning answer oh well i was and am going to add a bit more to my answer  Horse Shaggy dog story Vehicular cycling Sport utility vehicle Motorcycle Hitchhiking Aerial (dance move) Milton H.

if my mare has milk does that mean she is pregnant hi i just bought a year old paint mare like weeks ago but for some reason she has milk the lady that i bought her from said nothing about her being in foal so i started to check all the websites and books just to see the symptoms and it all seems to fit i really need to know i do not have a barn and i sure do not have a nice grassy pasture i know that i need to call the vet but i really am hardly ever home and our vet is always very busy i don't know if i should board her at a barn close by for a couple weeks or just keep a close eye on her she is a wonderful horse i really do not want anything to happen to her what do i do i know nothing about foals and nothing about pregnant mares please help the only reason i said that i was hardly at home was because i have to work on weekdays till pm because like every horse owner know horses cost money but i am home weekends i have had horses for years and been around horses all my life i have horse sense i also train kids to ride but i just have never had a foal i have paddocks just dirt no grass i ride all my horses twice a week and have trained horses everything they know so please don't treat me like i don't know what i am doing thanks you need to have a vet do an exam on her to see if she is pregnant and if she is the vet will also help you set up a good feeding worming and vac schedulle because mares in their last months need a higher protein grain and to be wormed and vaccinated so that the foal will be resistant to these things if she is in foal it would probaly be wise to take her to a boarding facility that has experience with foals and foaling so if need be they can help your mare foal and they'll be able to tell if she's close to foaling or if she's having any problems while foaling good luck and i hope all works out well but usually when i mare bags up full with milk she is to foal within weeks a good horse website where you ask questions and a vet answers then is www allabouthorses com there are many answered questions about mares and foaling check it out  Guinea pig Dairy Pet skunk Seabiscuit Livestock Equine conformation Insulin Ferret Milk Ocean's Twelve STS-86 Breastfeeding Thoroughbred Malaria Milton H.

are there such things as reputable dealers my two freinds came over from jersey to look for horses to buy both are experienced horsewomen who have owned and ridden all their lives both had the horses fully vetted as in five stage which they both passed one is now having to have a court battle as her vet and farrier told her a week after the mare arrived that the mare has a deformity in her leg which should have been picked up in the vetting been there since birth and should never have passed as she cannot be rideen ever again sold as year old competition horse the other horse has a club foot i'm not going to name the yard because of the court situation and don't want to jepodise the proceedings but is there such thing as a reputable dealer they couldn't use their own vet becuase they are from jersey and the vet wouldn't come over to the uk the club foot is not that bad the farrier has only picked it up because he has shod it correctly and the vet reports have not mentioned anything about the deformity in the mares' leg i think it's a case of the dealer knew the problems and paid the vet off to pass the horses the deformed horse the one that is going to be the court case the club footed one isn't couldn't be spotted by the eye hence the fact my friend didn't pick it up it's not a visual problem in short no there is no such thing as a reputable dealer horses tend to go to dealers for one reason a problem weather its behavioural or physical always use your own choice of vets look in yellow pages for a local one to where you are looking at the horse first find out who the seller uses never the one the seller recommends always have bloods taken proof of doping should temperament change the very best of luck to your friends  Sin City Craps Horse Docking Equine conformation Piccolo Junior Saga Tour de France Roswell UFO incident Brian Close Garfield Horseshoe Captain Thunderbolt The Contender (television series) Microeconomics Milton H.

first horse beginner rider i have ridden a horse before several times actually but i am not very experienced the fastest gait i've ever gone at was a canter or lope whichever you want to call it i've done small jumps but never in competition i've ridden quarter horses a morgan a paint and a quarter horse thoroughbred mix my bff has a black quarter horse thoroughbred mix named sugar that bred with a pure blooded quarter horse named dandy and she had a bay quarter horse thorughbred mix named holly holly is now months old will be three months on aug i have been around horses pretty much all my life i dont live with them but i am around them often i love them i am not afraid of them in the least bit even though i was kicked by holly and almost kicked in the head by a full grown horse i have never had a horse and i have never taken a real lesson though i ride often i am going to take official lessons once i can drive myself to the stables what type of horse shoould my st be i dont know if this matters but the stables i will be taking lessons at is a very good stable it is clean and i am friends with the stable owner even though she is an adult and i am ms tammy the owner takes very good care of her horses and boards other horses she owns only quarter horses but she boards any type of horse i didnt know if this matters but decided to include it for nixitee i am ' and i am located in the carolinas the barn i want to take lessons at has horses for sell i would make sure you get something first and foremost that is suited for what you want to do are you more interested in western pleasure english pleasure hunter jumper do you think you may want to learn dressage what types of lessons does your future barn owner offer does she even offer lessons in the discipline you'd like to pursue are you wanting to eventually show also what is your budget for purchasing a horse will your parents help you are you good enough friends with the barn owner that she'd be willing to work out a deal of manual labor in exchange for boarding costs all of these are very important questions you need to ask and answer yourself before you really start horse shopping if you're i would presume that you probably won't grow too too much more so depending on your height make sure you get something that you won't outgrow in a year i think anything over h is really unnecessary unless you're just ridiculously tall or have very long legs so you should be fairly safe with a horse at the very most that tall i know everyone is infatuated with large horses but depending on the breed they can have serious joint problems as a result of being so big be careful about purchasing something just because it's cheap but also realize you do not need to spend a ridiculous amount of money to get a nice horse regardless of the price make sure you have a proper vet check done ask all of the important questions regarding colic history any lameness issues if it's a qh whether it's hypp negative does the horse crib any vices yada yada yada i don't know where you're located but here are just a few to prove to you great horses exist for moderate prices hunter jumper http www dreamhorse com show horse php form horse id english pleasure http www dreamhorse com show horse php form horse id dressage http www dreamhorse com show horse php form horse id western pleasure trail http www dreamhorse com show horse php form horse id http www dreamhorse com show horse php form horse id etc  Dressage Arabian horse Horse gait Show jumping Hunt seat Eventing Show hunter Equitation American Quarter Horse Dog agility Standardbred horse PHP Thoroughbred Tennessee Walker Connemara pony Microeconomics Horse tack Charisma (horse) Supply and demand Capitalism Economy of Russia Theory of conduct MMORPG Inflation Selle Fran__ais Seabiscuit Parachuting Labor theory of value Horse show Space Shuttle program Software engineering Milton H.

is howrse com worth playing is howrse com worth playing even if i own a horse in real life do i need a sponser or does anyone need a new referral i guess i should put this under the catagory games recreation video online games hmm i just started an account about days ago because i have been hearind all the questions about it on these forums it isn't half bad once you figure out how it works it gets very addicting when you first sign on you 'create' your first horse you get a horse skill related job and you can train your horse and enter it into different competitions it can get frustrating and tedious though because once you use up your horse's energy you have to wait until the next day to start working with it again you don't need a sponsor to play either give it a try it's very amusing especially when you start breeding and running your own stable  Wheel of Fortune Procrastination Table tennis Machinima New York Giants Poker jargon You Don't Know Jack $ale of the Century Quizbowl Paintball Theory of conduct Blackjack Ben Johnson (athlete) Gambling Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Game Megatokyo Norway national football team Ocean's Twelve 1957 World Series Neopets Family Feud ELO rating system Sport Pyramid (game show) MapleStory SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Dream Job (Season 2) Viral marketing Homestar Runner The Sims American football Utopia (online game) Shaggy dog story Lou Gehrig Taikyoku shogi Internet troll Horse gait Thoroughbred horse race RuneScape skills Chain Reaction (game show) Sydney Riot of 1879 Pitaten Pinball I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Horse Now You See It Warhammer 40,000 Newbie Eventing Steam (content delivery) Game show Tic-Tac-Dough Winning Streak Tennis Blockbusters (game show) Chu shogi Password Only Fools and Horses Maverick (film) 2005 World Series Sumo Seabiscuit Whose Line Is It Anyway?

slowing down my mare rushes her jumps she has a naturally fast canter anyway but its getting dangerous im scared shes going to trip or something and fall i can keep her steady until about a stride or two away but then she just gallops over the jump she seems to use speed to get over the jump instead of staying in an impulsive but steady canter as a result she flattens out and often hits the pole i do alot of gridwork with her but it just doesnt slow her down i do alot of schooling and things like metre circles and i have been practising transitions etc but its hasnt helped alot with her rushing the jumps any ideas of how i can slow her down i ride her in a hackamore because she hates having a bit in her mouth yes she has regular visits fom the dentist and theres no problems with her teeth etc so please dont say use a stronger bit because she is impossible to ride in a bit i had a stage vet check done weeks ago and shes in no pain she just gets way over excited p s ive tried doing half halts and she pretty much ignores me and hints on getting a better half halt from her any take a deep breath both you and your girl i've done this one and it can be done sounds like you've been doing a lot of work on the flat and that's a great start i'd recommend coming down to a smaller fence for awhile until this is straightened out it will make things calmer for both you and your horse my horse will also blasts through gridwork so i feel your pain i had a clinician tell me to just let him race through it and that he'll learn not to do that my stubborn beastie jumped both of the jumps in a bounce at the same time scared the beejeebies out of the clinician i don't recommend letting a horse that really rushes a fence 'figure it out' in a grid in small doses i would agree with stopping your horse coming into a fence and setting her on her butt if necessary to do it if you start it make sure you can finish it if you fail and she goes over you're doing more harm then good once she has stopped calmly pet her and turn her to walk away she should be willing and able to stop coming into a fence and after the first couple of times she's going to be listening to see what you have up your sleeve being unpredictable can really help in this kind of a situation i have actually done a m circle that just happened to pass by a fence and one time out of every seven or so we would go over the fence instead of by it no real time to anticipate and get excited but this only works if the rider can stay calm and not telegraph to the horse for you sit up breathe slow and steady hands steady and soft not open fingers that's the last thing you want with a horse that's going to rush if you start a tug of war with a thousand pound animal you will lose and it doesn't matter what you have in their mouth do not look at the fence look past it count the rhythm and ride the rhythm call out as you approach calm and steady do this after you've set her on her butt once or twice don't ride the fence ride the rhythm don't get anxious and anticipate her rushing and really really don't lean forward sit back sit down relax and assume that she will be a complete lady if you feel her start to build turn her away or set her on her butt one more time if you're soft and listening you'll be able to feel it before the desperate last two strides on the other side of the fence stop her in a straight line give her a nice pet and a scratch then walk away the hardest part to learn and something you are only going to really learn through doing is to hold with your back and not your hands pull on her face and she's going to pull back it's a vicious cycle you have to hold with the muscles in your back if your arms are getting sore or tired you're hanging on too tightly resist any change in rhythm with your body and this is where calling the rhythm out loud is excellent this is a subtle move and that's why i recommend setting her on her tail once or twice first so you have a fighting chance do not set her on her tail very often or she can start backing off of fences another scenario for learning to ride in this way that takes a heck of a lot of guts and a good trainer is lunging the trick no reins start out with no fence and do your transitions without your hands once you've got the idea it may take a couple of lessons work over a fence use your body to control her rhythm comming in it's nerve wracking at first since you feel like you have no brakes and the fence is comming and oh my goodness we're all gonna' die once you get the hang of it though you will know how to truly ride from you leg and back and the control you get is truly worth the hours spent going in a circle you are quite correct about the stronger bits and vet checks and i applaud you on your mare's behalf many times a horse does rush a fence out of fear if your girl has been given the green light it may be nothing more then remembered fear bringing down the fences also decreases the possiblity that she's rushing because she's not sure she'll make it over once her confidence is set it should be easier for her to stay calm moving up to a bigger fence  Eventing Milton H.

what can i do tomorrow i will be looking after horses and after i ride some of them i tend to get bored of riding duh so is there anything i can do to occupy myself out in the middle of nowhere there is only satellite tv and no internet i could sweep out the barn but that only takes like minutes i'm going to be there for days what can i do outdoors to keep myself occupied oh and i look after some injured horses which takes about minutes to an hour other than that i'm pretty much bored for the day until i feed them and just hang with them out in pasture lol i go to this place every day of the week practically and the barn is already clean so are the stalls because we put all the horses out to pasture and they arent in use all the brushes are clean and i can't ride all the horses because some havent been started yet they are too young and others are broodmares which we don't ride there are only about horses at the time that are ridable because the other broke horses injured themselves in the fencing out in pasture and i would ride the newly broke horses only if my horse trainer was around for supervision been there done that it can be soo boring what i would do would be to take walks read books and play with the animals just sit in a chair and relax it can never hurt to relax hope you can find anything to occupy your self best wishes  Milton H.

video of my horse http youtube com watch v oecoxn fhk what do you think about him what do you think of my riding rate laredo my horsey on a scale to and my riding thanks and please be mature http youtube com profile user laredo go there to watch all my videos thank you it's called free jumping geez lol um first off his mane was pulled non rated show doesn't need to be braided i was taught to lean that forward i have a release i didn't as i said old pictures shoes went flying off when i was running before got them back on so no worries there they were sloggers or whatever and running kinda made em fly off lol i do a bunch of no stirrup work too bareback also and i like my girth it's good leather can irriate the belly where do you see me riding without them bows thank you lol yes i do need more of a release i've noticed that too and so have my trainer but now that i know to move my hands forward i have a pretty good release and thank you for pointing out that barefoot isn't horrible everyones advice has been extremely helpful thank you so much very nice horse very good riding your chin is up and head looking forward in the jumping pics and your back is dipped nicely your arms are in correctly and your heels are down another thing i pay close attention to is that fact of where the riders heels are when going over a jump way to many times their a good rider in every other point but their heels slip three or more inches behind the girth when jumping you're heels are in the correct potistion being a half inch behind the girth as you go over very good the one thing i would mention is that you rise a little too high out of the saddle sit closer to your horse as you cue him to go over and you're leg will be stronger on him giving him more encouragment with him it looks like he doesnt need a lot of help going over but with a green horse you'd need some more leg and you'd find that sitting deeper and stretching up and the hips keeps your leg on stronger as for your horse very nice nice comfirmation and shoulder sloping and chest depth nice jumper with snappy knees that he really keeps up going over jumps very nice form as for the free style jumping i give you thumbs up i also train horses to obey without a rider not just jumping but also with the rider free lunging the horse giving it walk trot canter commands it gives the horse and rider a way of comunitcating out of the saddle and it helps the rider watch the way the horse carries itself over the jump but the real test is when you can take down those chairs and rope lines and still keep him on track you're doing a great job just keep at it with some more body language training you'll have him doing it remember you want him trained so that if you move in towards the jump he takes the jump and when you move out he follows your body signals and moves out of the jump line good luck horse rider ohh and p s there aint noth'en wrong with going barefoot as long as you're careful i do it all the time taking a walk along a dirt rode no shoes just me and my horse is one of my faveriote things to do and a nice trail ride without 'em is the coolest too so just remember to keep your toes clear and there's nothing wrong with it happy trails to you  Horse gait Professional wrestling throws Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling attacks High-heeled shoe Diving Show hunter Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Dressage Skateboarding trick Cowboy Professional wrestling aerial techniques Archery Swingout Powerbomb Dog training Hunt seat Piccolo Junior Saga Fast bowling Figure skating Suplex Glossary of partner dance terms Volleyball Parade (military) Glossary of ballet terms Show jumping Sin City Stirrup The Inside Strap-on dildo Backstroke Recumbent bicycle Glossary of climbing terms Weight training Parachuting Violin Tenshinhan DDT (professional wrestling) Tennessee Walker Kitesurfing Theory of conduct Obedience training Shaggy dog story Piledriver (professional wrestling) Equitation Marching band Sling (weapon) Professional wrestling slang Boxing Butterfly stroke Dog agility Lindy Basic Quake III Arena Backbreaker Eventing Cowboy boot Bubble Bobble Dragon Booster Shoe Snowboarding Pole vault Clean and jerk Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Amber Spyglass Rugby union positions Escape from New York Slayers Bicycle Japanese tea ceremony Neckbreaker EastEnders Captain Thunderbolt Dog Customs and etiquette of Japan Parachute Time Out of Mind Sailing Frankie Laine Goofy Charleston (dance move) Humphrey Bogart Jackass: The Movie Alaga__sia Social rule Taikyoku shogi Double bass Motorcycle Softball Pitaten Running

what color what color halter should i get for my black horse i saw a black horse wearing yellow tack once he looked soooo sharp what an eye catcher yellow on black you might think it would look like a bumble bee but it doesn't it looks really good i put royal blue on my black mare she looked really good in it white also looks really good on black horses sharp light oil leather looks really good on black horses too tip a cheaper way to find out what would look the best on your horse it to get color chips from wal mart or some other place that carries paint chips or get vet wrap vet wrap would allow you to be able to see the color better on the horse but the paint chips are free but it never hurts to have extra vet wrap on hand  Horse tack Horse Upholstery Comanche Light-emitting diode Pysanka Color Blue Knife Leather Microchip implant (animal) Sin City Professional wrestling holds Black Hunt seat Fish and chips Yellow The Warriors Piet Mondrian RGB color model Guinea pig Dragon Booster Taxicab Color theory Wassily Kandinsky Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Vehicle registration plate Armour Tibetan people CMYK color model Boston Red Sox The Catcher in the Rye Rainbow Brite The Legend of Zelda series enemies Tooth enamel Primary color Tag Red Equine conformation Drill bit Paint Diamond Horse show Softball Professional wrestling match types Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Harp White Nunchaku New York Mets Billiards Pigment Colours, standards and guidons Chromium Poker jargon Arabian horse Bridle Nintendo Entertainment System Billboard (advertising) Power Rangers Wood carving Melanin Snooker Cat James McNeill Whistler Saint Nicholas Hair color Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Queen bee Gamut Gray (horse) Paul Is Dead Kasparov versus The World Sega Dreamcast Harrow School Bacon Veterans Stadium Dog Material properties of diamond Ninja Poker chip ATI Technologies Judo Oreo Color temperature My Little Pony Ultramarine Thoroughbred Craps Timpani Eight ball Chicago White Sox Collecting fossils Waking the Dragons GunBound Detroit Tigers Tack DLP

horse riding recently i found out i was taking lessons with this girl that i was sharing the same horse with for a show four months ago while i was doing ft classes she was doing the beginner w t and w t c classes and she didn't even get high placings since then i had gotten a horse three weeks ago and i have been riding well now she is taking lessons with me and this other girl also i have jumped ' and i am working with a green jumping horse on x rails probably the whole winter unless we move up when he gets comfortable i was supposed to be showing ' this september if i didn't stop taking private lessons it seems every where i look riders who were lower than me or on the same level are jumping ' and getting better with each passing day some are leasing horses and half leasing and i am sitting here wondering 'how any tips on really improving my riding i can't two point or drop my stirrups on my horse because he freaks out on the xtra pressure and the hitting stirrups con also i want to get more familiar with the horse before i start lounging lessons with him and my mom we were going to start today because the indoor arena flooded and there was a circle left but we didn't have the lounge line or whip and my mom said no riding so we went home after leading him around i recently have been taught how to post right by my mom one advantage over these other people because they all post up and down and their legs move i am riding hunters any other tips on really improving my riding at home and on my horse i am really serious about this because every video i see of me riding after three days of the taping i want to cry not literally yeah i know ft isn't a big deal but the highest i am going is ' so yeah i know i am not the best but i really want to be good and do well i am not trying to brag or anything because i know i have nothing to brag about wow it looks like i confused some people here okay the reason i am not riding with out stirrups i love to ride with out my stirrups because i am crazy my horse used to be spurred to go back behind the girth and so if a stirrup hits him there he will gallop he used to be a barrels horse and speed events i can do it and i want to do it but i need to get used to my horse first and train him to see that it is okay two pointing i have been two pointing my whole life basically i am training him to except the pressure behind there and the shortening of the reins we got it at the halt walk and we are starting it at the trot i can't do it prolonged though because i need to release and sit to reward him jumping thing i am not going to jump any higher than ' or ' probably in my life so it is not technically fence height it is equtation i have a trainer and take lessons a week and ride times a week oh and i am training him over the winter i just said that i will be doing cross rails all winter with him probably to build up his confidence i just got him three weeks ago and his training will continue under the guidance of a trainer all winter and then in the summer spring of we are going to show you answered your own question you can be the best rider in the world but you are only as good as your horse and if he's having issues freaks out with pressure and the stirrups hitting him you are adjusting the way that you ride to accommodate him and therefore hindering yourself the others are learning and riding on horses without those issues so that it's easy for them to learn and progress quickly but you are getting left behind not because you aren't picking things up or not as good you are trying to get better and learn while having to deal with the horse's issues it shows that you are a competent rider because you are still holding your own but i think you'd go further if either your horse didn't have these problems or you were able to get another horse that will enable you to go forward and progress quicker without the hassles keep the faith it'll work out good luck  Horse gait Show

how can you tell if your horse is in good shape i was wondering how long should i be able to ride my horse what should i be doing with her and what should she look like when i'm done if she is in good shape if she can't do these things or gets too tired what is the best way to get her into shape i ride her about four to six days a week and i'm the only person who rides her or does anything with her i usually ride her for to minutes and she seems to handle that fine when i ride she is trotting most of the time she is somewhere between and years old i just don't know if she is in good shape because she is fairly fat she is on a diet and she won't slim down just wondering if her weight is decieving she does look very healthy her coat is shiny and her eyes are bright she has been more and more relaxed when i ride her but doesn't deem tired with what i do i've only owned her a year and when i first got her she couldn't even handle half an hour i already mentioned she is on a diet and it's the lowest fat grain we can find she only gets grass during the day and i think she does have arabian in her i don't have an arena all i can do right now is trial rides but they are flat and dry and i do a lot of trotting on them i have just been wondering when you know she is well conditioned because she has lost weight and gotten stronger since i've had her her last owner hardly did anything with her she is not pregnant the place she lived before me was where she grew up and she was only with other mares know that i own her she lives by herself she actually seems happier by herself when she's with another horse she is at the other end of the pasture and she complains when the other horse gets close the amount of exercise a day depends on your horse and what type of work you are doing to maintain fitness and keep your horse healthy minutes of exercise a day is sufficient good job the amount of time you spend in the saddle is not as important as the quality of work when it comes to losing weight building muscle and becoming fit i am not sure what type of riding you are doing however getting a horse fit is the same in all disciplines you start out slowly and gradually building until you are doing more advanced work so how do you know how fit your horse is and when do you know its safe to increase the amount of work the answer is simple before and after each exercise you need to check your horses pulse which is the number of heartbeats in a minute and respiratory rate the number of breaths your horse in a minute after your lesson you will also need to check your horse s recovery rate how long it takes for your horse s pulse and respiration to get back to normal what s normal this varies from horse to horse keep a journal and record your horses pulse and respiration daily to see what is normal for your horse bpm beats per minute here are some average rates pulse resting bpm respiration resting breaths per minute recovery rate now the recovery rate is how you measure exactly how fit your horse actually is the faster it takes your horses pulse and breathing rate to get back to normal the fitter your horse is once your horse s recovery rate is minutes or less then you can begin to slowly increase the difficulty or the amount work your horse is doing remember that just because a horse is skinny doesn t mean that he is necessarily fit my horse appears to have a bit of a belly on him but he is actually the best conditioned and athletic horse in our barn and he is years old keep this in mind when evaluating your horse here is how you check for your horses pulse and respiration pulse to check a horse s pulse you can either invest in a stethoscope or you can just use your fingers i prefer using a stethoscope because it is a lot easier but it is not necessary you will also need a watch with a second hand on it to find the horse s pulse look near the front on the left side of your horses jaw bone under it or behind your horse s left elbow press firmly and count the pulse for seconds and then multiply that number by four the number you get is how many heart beats in a minute here are some pictures i found on the internet to help you see where to find the pulse http z about com d horses steth jpg behind the elbow http www equinevetservice com images proced pulsejaw jpg under the jaw respiration you can either look at your horse s flank or place your hand to your horses nostril and count how many times your horse exhales like you did for the pulse count for seconds and multiply that number by four the number you get is the number of breaths your horse takes in a minute recovery rate after exercise check your horses pulse and respiration rate about every ten minutes record how long it took your horses breathing to get back to normal don t forget to record your results safely getting a horse in shape when conditioning a horse the safest and most effective way is to ride long and slow with a lot of walking breaks here is a is an example of what you can do to get your horse in shape first two weeks start with a working walk minutes and gradually increase to minutes near the end of the second week have a few stretches of trot trot in two minute intervals with at least five minutes of walk in between next two weeks walk up and down hills replace some of your walking with minute trot intervals with at least minute walks in between gradually increase your rides so that they are thirty minutes long next ten days or so increase your rides to minutes adding five minute trot intervals with ten minute walks in between also you can trot up gentle hills and walk down them after ten days add about two minute canters with trot and walk intervals in between second month start increasing the amount of canter and trot work you can also start going over cavelletti cavelletti are four to seven sets of raised poles two twelve inches off the ground for safety on the ground with even spacing that is appropriate for your horses gait and the size of his stride cavelletti are used to get your horse to pick up his feet round through his back and engage his hindquarters to thrust him forward basically it will help his movement and help him gain more muscle mass here is a picture to help you get an idea of what cavelletti look like http www rene wehe de images cavaletti jpg note cavelletti can be ridden at any gait and used for any discipline you should only use cavelletti once or twice a week and you should let an experienced horse person to evaluate your horses movement and determine the right distance between the poles typically trotting poles are set at about apart but again the distance should be set for your horse and should only change when your horse is starting to advance and is ready to shorten or lengthen his stride month three now your horse up to an average fitness level and is ready to start doing more difficult flat work and maybe some light jumping remember to gradually increase the amount and quality of work to prevent injury also refer to your horses recovery rate before you increase the intensity and or duration of your exercises i hope this helped you some if you have any other questions please don t hesitate to contact me kiersten yahoo com here are some books that should help you if you need further information the united states pony club manuals of horsemanship levels d a by susan e harris grooming to win susan e harris it has a section on conditioning lessons with lendon by lendon gray this book will help you understand how to get your horse to use his back and booty muscles it also gives you different exercises to help your horses overall fitness happy trails kiersten  Prostate cancer Bicycle Myocardial infarction Pulse

i have a y o horse what should i do next he is years old tb and off track he has little bad habits since he wasn't there long i feel like i am always hanging on his mouth yet if i let up he gets too fast i try useing my body to slow his trot but that doesn't help much he is also very stiff in the neck i work with him and he is getting better at giving me his neck but are there certain excersizes perfect for this i thought of ungling him with side reins is that worth it i don't want to bring him us to be hard at the mouth but i don't know how to give him rein without letting him speed up his pace he is very clumsy and still trips and sinks his hind i use a regular d ring snaffel and that is it please give me your excersizes or comments on what we shoudl work on and how to start pulling him into frame i have a similar problem with my year old while it sounds like you need some professional help temporary at least there are some exercises you can do in the saddle and on the ground to loosen him up on the ground put him in a halter rope halter preferably with knots tied in it along the noseband they push on pressure points and give you a bit more control with a lead stand at his left shoulder facing his head put your right hand on his withers and pull his face around to you with your left hand if he is really stiff it may take him a week or two before he can really stretch out try to get him to hold himself up when you do this if he is laying on your hand using you to support his neck release him a little then pull him sharply back into place don't let the rest of his body move if he does then put him right back where you had him and tell him firmly whoa if he persists then back him up several paces and tell him to whoa again do this on both sides twice every time before you ride also stretch his legs out if his legs are stretched before you ride then maybe he wont feel the need to stretch out too much while you are riding it will also keep him from getting a cramp if he starts running before he's warmed up with his front feet stand at his shoulder and lift his foot up as if you were going to pick his hoof out wrap your left arm underneath his upper leg and put your right hand under the fetlock pull his leg up and slightly forward keep pulling forward and slide your left hand to just under his knee and keep your right under his fetlock pull the leg out in front of him and downward you'll feel him relax and give the leg to you release and let him stand do this on both legs stretch him slowly so he doesn't get hurt the rear legs pick one up as if to pick out the hoof slide your hands down to the hoof and lifting the leg pull it as far forward to his shoulder as you can be sure to keep your face and body as far away as possible because sometimes they will reflexively pull it out of your grasp then pull the leg back and downwards do this on both legs at this point saddle him up i strongly recommend lunging him for at least five minutes before you ride don't lunge him for more than minutes everyday though because you'll strain his legs after you saddle him up lift both of his front legs up and forward before you excersise him this pulls the skin out from under the girth so it won't pinch him when he runs finally when you ride while stopped in the saddle slide your left hand down the reins a bit and pull his face towards your knee keep your right hand in contact with his mouth but dont pull only pull if he steps forward and then back him up several paces and tell him firmly to whoa if he starts to turn in a circle let him eventually he'll get bored don't release pressure try to get him to hold his own weight when you do this don't let him lay on your hands if he tries release him a little then pull him firmly back into place keep at it until you can maintain pressure just to hold him there not to hold his face up keep him held there until his mouth neck and eyes relax if he is chopping on the bit don't release him this will teach him to be softer on your hands if you keep at it i swear it works do this on both sides at least twice right when you get in the saddle repeat the process throughout your riding especially if you notice he is pulling on your hands sorry i blabbed so much my trainer taught me all of this and it has really helped good luck don't give up  Weight training Casualty lifting Fast bowling Butterfly stroke Professional wrestling aerial techniques Boxing Parade (military) Horizontal bar Dog training Glossary of climbing terms Volleyball Diving Mattress Drowning Front crawl Neckbreaker Rugby union Glossary of partner dance terms Contredanse Glossary of ballet terms Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Swimming Bicycle Dressage Milton H.

what's with the show name i'm really confused here why does your horse need any special name other than what you call them unless they are registered is this a pretend registered name or just a new trend that is circulating through the horse showing world wow maybe i've been out of the hsw too long this is totally out of curiosity not trying to discount anyone i guess i don't have any problem with first place goes to nifty owned and shown by cindy even when i showed a registered aqha i entered him at open shows as face not another jim dandy interesting maybe it's personal preference it's just a way of making your horse more individual every horse i know has a show name even if they only go to the local pony club my current horses are all registered with proper names but when i was a kid i made up a 'posh' name for each of my ponies and used it in shows also in even a small show there's probably or entries called 'star' or 'flash' so it helps differentiate between them anyway there's no harm in it  Horse My Little Pony Thoroughbred Horse show Connemara pony Arabian horse Selective breeding Morgan horse Appaloosa Password Equine conformation National Register of Historic Places Pony Express Domestication of the horse X86 assembly language Monetary policy Slash fiction Vehicle registration plate Docking EastEnders Dog show Fan fiction Zoophilia The Fairly OddParents Intellectual property Transsexuality Science fiction on television Target Corporation Microeconomics Chinese character CPU cache Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Opie and Anthony Rolex Kentucky Three Day 4Kids TV Hunt seat Spice Girls Megan Griffin The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The Guess Who 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Springfield Elementary School The Standard Filling station Town meeting Lady and the Tramp Mad Money Ferrari Aerial (dance move) American Quarter Horse Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Single Transferable Vote 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Gambling Celebrity Sing Tao Daily Plame affair Conscription Only Fools and Horses Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Pow-wow Ultimate Muscle Evolution of the Horse British comic Ben Johnson (athlete) Public domain Show jumping Care Bears Horse gait Chess Ferret Behavioral finance Lawyer Theory of conduct Boise, Idaho Lisp programming language Game show Captain Marvel (DC Comics) Security (finance) The Man From Snowy River IA-32 Achtung Baby Inflation Post office Telephone numbering plan Flash (comics) Windows registry Central processing unit The Stone Pony Compiler optimization The Red Pony Web traffic Scottsdale, Arizona Am730 The Big Break Goatse.cx Wal-Mart Register window Transformer

crypto orchid blood test i recently bought what i thought was a year old quarter horse gelding turns out he's mounting every mare thats in season so i'm starting to have serious doubts on his gelding status as visually he does not appear to be a stallion i needed to know if there is a blood test to find out for sure if he is fertile or not preferably before the mares come up pregnant you can certainly have a blood test done to check his testosterone levels plenty of properly castrated geldings will breed mares the fact that you mention he only mounts mares in heat and that you say nothing of the fact that he acts studdy any other time is a good indicator he had both his testicles removed i do not know a vet alive who will castrate a monorchid in the field it is considered unethical it is also unetchical to only take off one testical meaning if only one is present certainly in a case of cancer of a testicle on a stallion it would certainly be all right in that case therefore anytime two testicals are not visible the vets refer horses to the equine hospitals so that the castration can be completed there in other words they go inside and find the undescended testicle even if your horse really was left with an undescended testicle he could never get a mare pregnant from the testicle being kept inside the body all sperm would be dead from overheating  Castration Horse Cryptorchidism Prostate cancer Testicular cancer Testicle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sterilization (surgical procedure) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Horus Puberty Pregnancy Endocrinology Equine conformation Arabian horse Human chorionic gonadotropin Code 46 Strap-on dildo Chicken Acne Hinny Thoroughbred Days of our Lives Sperm Whale Menstrual cycle Selective breeding Infantilism Prolactinoma Endometriosis International Phonetic Alphabet Charisma (horse) Docking Oral contraceptive Colorectal cancer Stem cell Intersex surgery Abortion debate Penis removal Earthworm Autism Ferret Donkey Cytomegalovirus Breaker Morant Cancer Sin City Pony Welsh Cob (Section D) Smarty Jones Roan (color) Morgan horse Poker jargon Lung cancer Sex assignment Eventing Endometrium Whaling Mule Vitamin C Captain Thunderbolt Baldness treatments Polycystic ovary syndrome First aid Birth control Transsexuality Horses of Middle-earth Pony of the Americas Thermal power station Cybele Alcoholism Zoophilia Apollo 8 Dressage Death Pornographic movie Dialysis Baldness Folic acid Hormone replacement therapy Vampire Connemara pony Intersexuality Embalming Fugu Mobile phone radiation and health Seabiscuit Epistemology Taboo food and drink Left-handed Snake In vitro fertilisation Sunday Silence Trakehner Biology and sexual orientation Ethics Livestock Japan Cup Punishment

rear cannons hey i have a project question and it is name one type of horse that selects horses with their rear cannons close together a friend says it is a quarter horse but i was curious i can't find it anywhere on the web and i need an answer before tomorrow we have judging shire horses and clysdales are bred to have 'cow hocks' which also brings their hind cannons closer together there is much debate regarding this trait and the fact that it is encouraged in the show ring such horses are now being bred with cow hocks to such a degree that the horse can injure itself the reason they were originally bred to have close hind legs was to enable them to walk comfortably in the furrow when ploughing a field the argument from the heavy horse society says good draft horse conformation in general including set set is having angle to the hind legs for leverage this is not to be confused with being cow hocked cow hocks are when the actual leg joints are not in alignment and are angled a horse with good set has a perfectly straight leg as is important in any breed and that whole leg is put onto the horse at a slight angle with hocks together this is what a pulling horse of any type needs to do his job properly an old saying goes that a good draft horse will expletives removed at a walk poop on one hock and knock it off with the other as it goes by another thing that is very important to look for is sufficient bone to support that big horse without being coarse but he should still have good clean limbs a horse that has a huge body on top of little spindly legs will not hold up for a useful life in practice most highly placed horses have very poor hind leg conformation  Horse Horse gait Dressage Professional wrestling holds Evolution of the Horse Plough Gray Wolf Species Show jumping Domestic rabbit Boxing Cattle Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Dog Diving Hemp Spanking Appaloosa German Shepherd Dog Professional wrestling throws Fast bowling The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Skateboarding trick Anatomical terms of location Strap-on dildo Tetrapod Arabian horse Bigfoot Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Table saw Professional wrestling slang Poker jargon Socrates Sailing New York Giants Capital punishment Archery Show hunter Consensus decision-making Combine (Half-Life 2) Sin City Kurt Angle Seabiscuit M16 (rifle) Unreal Guns, Germs, and Steel Tennessee Walker Toilet humour Thoroughbred Dog show Virginia Opossum Docking Eddie Guerrero Professional wrestling attacks Coercion Democracy GED Glossary of climbing terms Theory of conduct Piccolo Junior Saga Milton H.

what to give her my horses are pastured down the road in a cousin s pasture with her horse i grain my horses every morning mainly to put weight on my mare and would like to give the other mare something so she does not feel left out and to make friends with her the thing is the mare is fat and does not need the sweet feed that i'm giving my horses what can i give her cheap that would not put more weight on the mare or will the little less then a of a scoop grain that i'm already giving her be fine what i mean by fat is a heathly wieght one more thing the horse is only on grass also i like to keep her away from my gelding when he eats because he is very agressive towards other animals at feeding time not humans i missed used the word fat what i had ment was she is fatter then my mare who is skinny i am not going to ride her she is yrs and unbroken and is not messed with that often i'd suggest just feeding her carrots not feeding her anything at all can cause some behavior problems because your other horse is getting grained you can feed quite a large amount of carrots without seeing any adverse effects on your mare so just tossing a handful in a bucket and giving it to her at the same time you feed your other horse is a good option  Hamster Dairy Livestock Guinea pig Chinese New Year Breastfeeding Foie gras Equine conformation Sorghum Bread Anorexia nervosa Weed control Milk Chocolate Vegetarianism Cat Agriculture Charisma (horse) Jewish cuisine Mosquito Arabian horse Everton F.C.

does foot and mouth affect horses there has been a recent foot and mouth scare i do not live near it but i was just wondering wethe ror not it affect horses foot and mouth disease is a highly contagious viral disease that affects domestic cattle sheep pigs goats and deer other animals such as elephants hedgehogs and rats are also susceptible to infection foot and mouth disease is not a human affliction and there are no reports of it ever affecting horses the disease causes blisters which produces chronic lameness weight loss and decreased production and can bring about abortions and sterility it is very common for these blisters to appear on the tongue and inside of the mouth inside the nostrils on the coronary band teats udder snout of pigs and area between the toes the incubation period for foot and mouth is to days foot and mouth disease is an extremely contagious viral disease though it is rarely fatal to adult infected animals but causes pain and suffering to those animals which leads to a severe drop in production the disease can be devastating to the economy of an infected country although foot and mouth disease does not pose a serious risk to human health humans and other animals can act as vectors for the virus and can spread infection among animals or between farms methods of transmission of fmd include direct contact with clinically ill recovered carrier animals or exposed vaccinated animals virus particles can be found in body fluids including urine feces saliva semen and milk and also in exhaled breath the fmd virus can survive in the lungs and nasal passages of humans for several days and in the tonsils for several weeks virus particles are released and can infect susceptible animals when the person exhales the fmd virus can survive for several weeks on clothes and shoes especially if they are dirty pets or other animals such as horses roaming the area can carry the virus contaminated meat and cheese products airborne virus particles can be carried in air currents for up to miles during the last outbreak of foot and mouth in the equine community in the uk suspended competitions and restricted the movement of horses in order to help the farming community control the spread of the disease on the yard where my horses are stabled we also have sheep and cattle for three months we did not leave the yard and rode only in the fields and outdoor arena to minimise the risk if the disease spreads again we will again be confined to the yard and be required to disinfect our footwear and the tyres on our vehicles as we visit and leave the yard  Hepatitis C Influenza Virus Lassa fever Escherichia coli O157:H7 Dairy Equine conformation Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Anthrax Measles Smallpox Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Milk 2001 UK foot and mouth crisis Transmission (medicine) Rocky Mountain spotted fever Rotavirus Swimming Foodborne illness Spanish flu Diarrhea Domestic rabbit Hepatitis B Toxoplasmosis West Nile virus Black Death Mumps Shrimp farm Vaccine Hepatitis Cancer Lyme disease Henipavirus Tsetse fly HIV test Influenza pandemic Yellow fever Zoonosis Vegetarianism Vitamin C Multiple sclerosis Guinea pig Tick Borna disease Genetically modified food Sexually-transmitted infection AIDS reappraisal Domestication Diabetes mellitus Medicine Malaria Biological warfare Diseases of the honeybee Quarantine Chagas disease Mosquito Infectious disease Methamphetamine Dog Infectious mononucleosis Traumatic brain injury HIV Disease Progression Rates Food Sleeping sickness Horse Breastfeeding Chronic Wasting Disease Ferret Urinary incontinence Monkeypox Tobacco smoking Chronic fatigue syndrome

horse emergency need answers now we took our horse to the vet this morning and the vet said he has an impaction they administered oil through the nose and said that should help he is wanting to lay down and won't eat or drink he did have a little bowel movement but he is still agitated banomine does help he acts as if he wants lay dowhn but would that be a bad thing he is very exhausted first call your vet back this is a serious situation and your horse needs help while you are waiting i would very definitely keep the horse on his feet and moving longeing him gently at the walk and a slow trot notice the emphasis on the word slow will help to stimulate his gut so that he can pass the impaction and get some relief from the pain if the horse has already had oil then you should start to see that coming through in the manure about to hours after it's administered to the horse oil has a very definite smell so you will be able to tell when it starts to come through and your horse begins to pass it the trick with impaction colic is to keep the horse moving long enough that it can stimulate the gut and let him have a bowel movement this may mean walking the horse by hand or it can also mean something like free longeing in a round pen at slow speeds this is not the time to force the horse into hard work it will only exacerbate his pain and make his condition worse one other alternative which you can try is to take the horse for a short ride in the horse trailer as soon as they get in the trailer the first thing most horses do is poop i had to load my mare this morning so that i can get her checked for pregnancy at the local clinic and of course the instant she got in the trailer she pooped so i know that this works with some horses banamine when administered correctly is very useful with colicky horses it sometimes can slow the gut down though which is why you need to keep walking your horse until he passes the impaction if your horse will lie down quietly and not roll or thrash around because of the pain then you can let him rest for short periods while he's being watched as far as food goes i would offer the horse some hay and a bran mash made with salt molasses and vegetable oil make sure he has plenty of water that is at least room temperature not cold cold water will shock his system and make his condition worse so you need to avoid this the salt in the mash will make your horse thirsty and encourage him to drink which in turn will make it that much easier for him to pass the impaction bran is also an effective laxative one thing you definitely want to avoid if you can is letting the horse get dehydrated as this will only cause more problems and can lead to founder among other things keep an eye on your horse's manure output and also on the amount of water he drinks the vet is going to want to know this information anyway good luck and i hope your horse recovers soon  Equine conformation Horse colic Fecal incontinence Horse Laxative Poker jargon Guinea pig Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Hiking Clinical depression Shaggy dog story Guilty Gear Famine Diving Horse gait Thermal power station Social rule Prostate cancer Trailer Park Boys Drowning Dog training Sin City Diarrhea Toilet humour The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Coffee Theory of conduct Fancy rat Brewery Inflation Knife Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dehydration Dietary fiber Bread Swimming The Wack Pack Skateboarding trick Renewable energy Battles of Lexington and Concord Bubble Bobble Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Urinary incontinence Hyperthermia Allergy Irritable bowel syndrome Goodness and value theory Spanking Weight training Hypoglycemia Water Laminitis Crohn's disease Certified Nursing Assistant Chronic fatigue syndrome Insulin Traumatic incident reduction Aerial (dance move) Asthma Tenshinhan Constipation Vomiting USS Tunny (SS-282) Apollo 8 Sailing Ben Johnson (athlete) Sugar beet Electrophysiology Sodium chloride Abortion Psoriasis Triage Operation Market Garden Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Marching band Energy development Out-of-body experience 1957 World Series Coeliac disease Microeconomics Menstrual cup Happy Tree Friends Livestock Horseshoe Automobile Stuttering Foodborne illness

having your horse trained i've considered buying this filly well a mare she just turned three in march mayish time but she hasn't been broke gentled to ride problem lol but she has been handled since she was born alot and has been halter trained and ponied around on trails have you had any personal experience with sending your horse to a professional trainer for or minus days was it terribly expensive and how if your horse well trained those questions probably sound dumb but this is something i've considered doing i want opinons from people who have done so or know people who have done so you don't know till yah ask thanks well if she is completely green it will probably require more than days there are some trainers that specialize more in breaking and some more in what i call polishing you can talk to someone who breaks horses and they sometimes will charge one fee to get it done sometimes they do it by the time required for them to do it i know where i am now in cattle country the local dressage hunter community sends their horses to this one individual who is actually a cattle farmer but uses horses for ranching he charges one flat fee per horse i'm not sure what it is though it will depend on the quality of the trainer and what they deem their services worth the thing about training is when you need it you don't have much of a choice when it comes to polish i've seen people charge as little as mo and as much as although i'm sure depending on skill level the sky is the limit generally as someone else mentioned they will require you to board in their facility or charge an additional fee for visiting your property if you are not going to be able to find someone who specifically breaks horses talk to your prospective trainers and ask how many horses they have started from youth you want to be very sure that your horse is not the guinea pig the other thing about training is that you can't look at it in time limits each horse is different your filly may take months to reach the same training level that only took another horse they all learn at a different rate and pose a new challenge each time when you talk to a prospective polish trainer ask them what their method is what their schedule is like do they work the horse daily do they gradually build up the exercises do they have a set schedule for every ride for example when i ride i warm up for minutes walking only for the first work on old things for minutes work on new things for minutes then relax the horse and walk out talk to them about challenge horses they've had you want to know that if something arises they can deal with it best of luck  Horse Weight training Equine conformation Horse breaking Cowboy Arabian horse Education in the People's Republic of China Dressage Cable television GED Milton H.

hoof supplements have any of you used hoof supplements to help grow out the horse's feet okay following my saga of the too short trim by the farrier i can't shod my horse because he had white line disease when i bought him which severely weakend the wall of the hoof its getting better but still i thought about adhesive shoes but so many said the adhesive could do more damage and well it seems none of the farriers in my area have experience with this the soles of my horses feet are not toughening up due to absurd amounts of rain i've been treating them with iodine and venice turpentine every other day and tuff stuff once a week still to no avail i'm thinking of trying hoof supplements have any of you used any in particular that seemed to help the hoof grow out obviously the toughening will happen over time but i want to help him grow as much as possible to there is not pressure on the sole i was thinking of adding shoer's friend to my smartpak has anyone tried this one i know a common response is just proper nutrition to start well just added details he is on acco safe and sound which is nutritionally comparable to strategy he currently gets moormons minerals grostrong which is just a general nutritional supplement with electrolytes i know you suggested that before lisa where do you buy order copper sulphate crystals and formaldehyde i'm afraid we're in the middle of nowhere with the military so we've got to get everything off the internet also just added his feet were trimmed short two weeks ago thereabouts so i've just been waiting in the hopes things will get better they have slightly but not enough to put him back into work can you feed pure msm does it require lysine or anything for it to metabolize and become effective in building up the keratin msm speeds growth of any form of keratin such as hair and hooves the best thing for hardening feet is copper sulphate crystals and formaldehyde mix them together and apply to the foot with a paint brush x per day wear gloves and avoid the hair it works very quickly all our tb weanlings and yearlings had their feet treated that way as part of sales prep makes the feet hard as nails so that all that walking up and showing doesn't make them foot sore glue on shoes are awful it's not so much the adhesive it's the solvent that they use to remove them it just corrodes the feet  Horseshoe Equine conformation Nutrition Aluminium Prostate cancer Folic acid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Glass Laminitis Veganism Herpes simplex virus Explosive material Adhesive Sulfuric acid Nail (anatomy) Seismic retrofit Protein Tocopherol Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Shoe Horse Osteoarthritis Urinary incontinence Water purification Hamster Breastfeeding Atkins Nutritional Approach Brush Irish dance Methamphetamine Shaggy dog story Bodybuilding Stomach cancer Keratin Protein-energy malnutrition Alzheimer's disease Paint Claw Aspartame Car handling Tire Acetic acid Ammonia Water Drill bit Guinea pig Volleyball Massage Dragon Booster Acne Chronic fatigue syndrome Domestic rabbit Omega-3 fatty acid Milton H.

my horse has a swollen joint my horses back right leg is a little just a little swollen the fetlock on her right leg is just a little bit bigger than her left fetlock it does not hinder her in any way whatsoever i just noticed it today when i was grooming her she trotted happily out of her stall into her bigger pasture when i let her out so she can walk and trot on it fine what could it be like a sprain or something she doesn't have any wounds or scrapes on that leg and it doesn't feel hot at all she is completely normal except for the swollen fetlock i am going to put ice on it to see if the swelling will go down but any other ideas if it isn't better tom i will call the vet and she is in no pain whatsoever my horse rosie is yrs old and has never shown signs of arthritis or anything i ran some cold water on her leg for about min i will do it again before i put her away she has plenty of room to run around but most of the time she just grazes she is out all the time because she has a shelter in her pasture i just let her out into our fenced in yard every day because it is bigger than her could be a whole load of things from arthritic changes inside the joint suspensory ligaments that have been pulled mud fever or even a reaction to a bug bit i would cold hose it x today for mins at a time and give her a couple of bute tonight the fact that she isn't lame and it's just a bit puffy would say to me a suspensory ligament issue might have just torqued it in the pasture if she's running around outside i'd get her in and have her take it easy for a couple of days the bute and the hosing will take down the inflammation more than using it as pain relief  Horse Tennessee Walker Carpal tunnel syndrome Seabiscuit Gout Show hunter Osteoarthritis Phenylbutazone Arthritis Milton H.

endurance riding i horseback ride very often and i am now looking to train for endurance riding i've looked into it but none of the information i studied said i could use a western saddle is that possible also how do you know that your horse is able to do endurance well the next thing is to find a center that will actually let me enter one of thier horses since i don't actually own one but the thing is will centers let me do that yes you can use western saddles for endurance just put a fleece cover on it and some padding and you'll be good to go leasing a horse may be a better option since most riding academy's won't let you show their horses let alone ride it across the country you can full or half lease a horse when you full lease a horse you can take it anywhere you want and do whatever you want with it if you half lease a horse you can only ride it and groom it and possibly take it to a few shows but probably not an endurance ride leasing is like renting a horse you pay a certain amount of money each month to lease a horse like for examples for half leasing and maybe for full i reccomend arabians and arabian crosses for endurance riding they have unbelievable stanima if they are in shape i use to have a arab and she could trot around on a lunge line for three hours non stop i could barely get her to stop to train is very exhilerating you have to go on really long trail rides and lunge your horse a lot talk to a local trainer about how the training routines should go you can look around at riding academy's that may let you ride there horses is endurance just call around to a few places i can help you find one if you like just e mail me at xxpunkponyxx yahoo com if you need anymore info or if you want me to help you find a place i know some great places good luck  Horse Equine conformation Horse tack Captain Thunderbolt Arabian horse Cowboy King Ranch Eventing Equitation Canadian Pacific Railway Thoroughbred Western Saddle Seabiscuit Horse racing Akhal-Teke Paragliding Boston and Lowell Railroad Coronation of the British monarch Dressage Poker jargon Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Tennessee Walker Cross-country equestrianism New York City Subway Horse gait Dubai Western States Endurance Run Public transport Lo Wu Comanche Battles of Lexington and Concord John McDouall Stuart Railfan Arizona Territory Hiawatha Line Cavalry Garth Brooks Iditarod Horse breaking Belmont Park Archery Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Marathon dancing Textile manufacturing The Amazing Race New York Central Railroad Shaggy dog story Crossword Penske Racing Ben Johnson (athlete) Betting (poker) Craps Milton H.

how do i ask for a passage and a piaffe in a horse that has never even thought about doing one before there are three different horses that i might be working with a qh percheron mare very bulky but has good movement huge greenie but willing is spooky but not uncontrollable huge ground covering stride a thoroughbred gelding spooky long legs but has a bone shaft in his right foreleg and therefore has trouble with going to the right and has awkward short strided gaits a qh appaloosa gelding a bit headstrong quick but not uncontrollable not spooky tends to trip often big rather weird stride in the front instead of moving his whole leg forward smoothly he tends to bend his leg at the knee so that his hoof comes almost level with his knee then he moves his knee foward and sets his hoof down i'm not looking for anything fancy just something very small the horses are ridden all week by other people than me i only ride an hour each week and i'll have four one hour dressage sessions to try for it i suppose i can try it during a trot warm up during regular lessons but i'm aiming to be able to know how to ask for and get at least a little something by january which is when the freestyle performance is honestly i doubt that the thoroughbred and the qh appy cross could ever compete well above training level the thoroughbred has awkward not to mention short strided gaits which are a disadvantage the qh appy cross is also a combination of two downhill horses depending on their breeding some qh rarely are even or uphill but rarely can a downhill horse perform movements that are upper level the horse has to be on his haunches and even placing his wieght on both hindfeet not leaning or allowing his shoulder to collaspe the qh percheron has some potiential she has good movement as you say and a good ground covering stride however do not ask her to do any upper level movements without guidance from an instructor or a ground person who can tell you things that they can see and until you have completed her training if you are planning on training this mare up the levels i suggest that you read several books about getting a horse up the levels the late reiner klimke has a series i think they're dvds abou the development and training of a horse that is planned to go up the levels find an instructor who has also ridden at these levels even if you have already been there yourself one of my friends rode up to third level on her hanovarian mare won the dad perputal trophy and trained her to grand prix she can do canter half passe piaffe and passage but is now riding on a four year old oldenburg mare that she plans on taking up the levels she stills rides with her trainer whom shes worked with for years at least once a month  Arabian horse Lipizzan Harness racing Seabiscuit Charisma (horse) Trot (horse gait) American Saddlebred Standardbred horse Skateboarding trick Connemara pony Fast bowling Professional wrestling holds Thoroughbred Swimming Tennessee Walker Trakehner Aerial (dance move) Show jumping Weight training Cross-country skiing Appaloosa Hackney (horse) Might and Power Equitation Captain Thunderbolt Horse tack Powerbomb Glossary of ballet terms Professional wrestling throws Japan Cup Dog agility Gliding Akhal-Teke Clydesdale (breed) Swingout Recumbent bicycle American Quarter Horse Paragliding Backstroke Icelandic horse Traveller (horse) Horse racing Makybe Diva Selle Fran__ais Baseball Thoroughbred horse race Professional wrestling aerial techniques Evolution of the Horse Bicycle GED Obedience training Cricket Hunt seat Battles of Lexington and Concord Oldenburg (horse) Breaststroke Dog training Comanche 2000 Australian Grand Prix Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Glossary of climbing terms Front crawl Alexander Technique Ravi Shastri Suplex Northerly Rugby union Ben Johnson (athlete) Softball Japanese tea ceremony Piccolo Junior Saga Tetrapod Scientology beliefs and practices Dragon Booster Extreme Programming Melbourne Cup Smarty Jones Watkins Glen International Snowboarding Mouse (computing) Motorcycle Breeders' Cup

what type of bit is most recommended for hunter under saddle shows hi i am starting to show at aqha approved shows with my mare and i was curious to see what bit most hunter under saddle competitiors use in their classes thanks i know there are very many forms of dee rings what type would be best to show in the aqha rule book shows very clearly what type of snaffle bits and other bits are allowed in your hus classes i would read the book to be certain that your bit will conform to rules a simple d snaffle is probably the most common snaffle an o ring is also very very common i don't see many egg butts but they certainly are allowed kimberwicks of both sorts are allowed but fairly unpopular at this time with most trainers as the feeling is a hus horse should move on light contact and be forward and the leverage action of a kimberwick can stop that for many horses as for the type of bit with a d or o ring once again that is very specifically shown in the rule book plain smooth slow twist french link all are listed and state whether they can or cannot be used in junior or senior horse classes i no longer have a current aqha book but i do have a current apha book and it will not allow certain snaffle bits to be used on junior horses and it clearly says how big the o is allowed etc and i'm certain aqha is the same as for which is more popular in your area i would recommend you watch some shows and see for yourself i'm certain that it varies slightly from your home to where i live in canada but one thing hasn't changed use the bit that your horse moves best in my trainer is a big fan of o rings and feels there is more feel and play which makes it better for your horse than a d ring good luck and have fun  Horse tack Equine conformation Hunt seat Horse Drill bit Bridle Glossary of partner dance terms XML Show hunter Dog agility Manual transmission Central processing unit The Amazing Race Show jumping Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Hash table Milton H.

pony or mini horse ever since i worked for riding lessons a thing i had to give up recently due to my unreliable dad being unreliable and mom being very pregnant i have wanted a horse i have been thinking very far in the future about my own kids i would like them to start riding and caring for one at a young age because we all know its great exercise and teaches responsibility don't get me wrong if they want to stop then they can stop i would gladly care for it one question still dangles in my mind mini horse or a pony i will probably give riding lessons when my kids outgrow them so they're still in use like i said if they don't like it then i will gladly take on the job of caring for it i read and heard that you should fit your partner if my kids are too small for a big horse then they won't learn to ride properly like i said if they don't like it then i will gladly take on the job of caring for it i read and heard that you should fit your partner if my kids are too small for a big horse then they won't learn to ride properly minis have very choppy trots i suggest a good welsh pony or poa you can get a section b or a welsh pony and get something medium sized amung the ponies also poas have color and great temperment for a well trained pony you'll have to pay money but it is worth it you don't want your kids on something unmanagable or maybe if you know someone in the future who is smallishly built and can ride ponies and is an expirenced rider  Pony Equine conformation Horse Welsh Cob (Section D) Hunt seat Welsh mountain pony (Section A) Milton H.

are there other ways besides the vet to tell if my mare is pregnant the reason i am asking is because when i got her from my sister she said she wasn't pregnant but now lately i have noticed that her belly is becoming wider and lower she is a year old arabian mare now i know she was just in season around a month ago mares can't go into season if they are pregnant can they and please if most of the people who tried to answer jordan m's question about being able to ride during a horse pregnancy don't answer mine it's obvious most you don't know anything thank you to any real horse people can answer me lol paint pony that is what i was afraid of can a mare go into season if she is pregnant is she bagging up that means have her nipples started to swell and has her udder become firm to the touch feel her hindquarters the muscles around her tail will become quite soft and flaccid right before the delivery if she's pregnant this is nature's way of preparing for the birth if she was in heat a month ago though i seriously doubt she's in foal unless you either bred her by live cover or she got out and somehow got covered on her own by a stallion lincoln charmer though he may be is a little too young to be fertile yet so that's out i have never known a mare who was pregnant to come into heat so i think that you are probably seeing a grass or hay belly with her even if by some chance the mare was bred she would not be showing signs of impending birth yet mares carry foals for months or days give or take weeks either way i hope that answers your question  Equine conformation Horse Pregnancy Welsh Cob (Section D) Fertility awareness Lipizzan Thoroughbred Pony of the Americas Obstetrics Welsh pony of cob type (Section C) Arabian horse Breastfeeding EastEnders Abortion debate Estrus cycle Connemara pony Selle Fran__ais Donkey Cat Dartmoor pony Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Comanche Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Domestication of the horse Dog Miscarriage Horus Elephant House Mouse The Ashlee Simpson Show Twin Days of our Lives Friends Childbirth Hackney (horse) Akhal-Teke Ocean's Twelve Kakapo Seabiscuit Horses of Middle-earth Pregnancy fetishism Menstrual cycle Knots Landing Abortion Exmoor pony Big Brother (USA TV series) Gray (horse) Trakehner Przewalski's Horse Karabakh Roan (color) The Red Pony Clydesdale (breed) Male pregnancy Satchel Paige Evolution of the Horse Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Melanie Wilkes The Apprentice 2 Oldenburg (horse) Only Fools and Horses Welsh mountain pony (Section A) Domestic goat In vitro fertilisation Sunday Silence Morgan horse Welsh pony (Section B) Gettysburg Address Charmed Poliomyelitis Sharon Tate Platypus Apollo 8 Kurt Cobain Mattress Origin belief Lammtarra Social rule Dressage Folic acid Spina bifida Tocopherol Mule Selective breeding Coffee Breaker Morant Wheat Capercaillie Year of the Spider Garth Brooks Wheel of Fortune Seahorse Species Docking Crossing Jordan Weather lore Cheetah Dairy The Joker's Wild

anticipating hey everyone my horse laredo tends to dance and really get anxious when i shorten my reins at a walk trot he thinks i'm going ask him to canter because when i was teaching him to canter from a halt and walk i was told to shorten my reins but now he's anticipating me in the show arena in flat classes equatation my trainer wants me to shorten my reins and have steady contact but he gets anxious and goes fast then he halts and when i ask him to move forward again he almost goes into a canter any ideas on how to make him just chill out oh and please be mature thanks taylor thank you paint pony this sort of problem is a horse personality problem more than a training problem some horses that are a bit more reactive lively or forward tend to start anticipating their forward transitions they aren't trying to be bad but they are guessing and fretting other more laid back and lazy type horses have the opposite problem at times they are waiting and anticipating the down transitions please let me stop oh i think you're going to let me stop hurrah with a horse such as yours its important that you don't avoid shortening the reins instead spend alot of time shortening your reins as part of your daily training and vary the things you are going to ask from him when you've shortened reins basically it's okay for him to realize that a shortened rein means to pay attention and that he's going to be asked to do something but he needs to wait to see what you ask i would really spend ten twenty or more times each riding lesson shortening your reins briefly giving him a cue doing the job and then going back to riding with your normal length reins examples of cues could be pivot on the hindquarters pivot on the forequarters half halts haunchs in up and down transitions work on the diagnial backing etc don't be in a rush to execute each job just go about things slowly and steadily if you're riding on the rail gather your reins don't worry if your horse starts rushing just pull him back and ask for the next cue say it's a pivot on the forehand when he's done it praise him and carry on five minutes later gather the reins and ask for something new if this hasn't become a really deeply engrained habit you should be able to teach him fairly soon to listen instead of getting in a flap and it will also make your horse more responsive and talented as he works on all these other excercises lastly with this type of horse it's really important that you don't loose your patience with them and get too heavy handed or heavy legged rough contact out of frustration or impatience often really frazzles this sort of horse and makes the problem worse instead try to remain slow and patient in your cues good luck  Horse Horse gait Social rule Show hunter Milton H.

my horse's behavior suddenly worsened i have a year old quarter horse gelding he was only broke a year ago now he has never been perfect but he was rideable and i even jumped him i went a way for a week and i asked my instructor to have some experienced people ride him ever since i came back he has been crazy he bucks when i ask him to do anything more than walk and he is spooking at everything litteraly everything i have no idea what's going on i think maybe someone might have messed with him while i was gone the vet will be out friday any ideas somebody obviously rode your horse and allowed him to get away with some things he shouldn't have and this is the result the bucking could be due to any number of causes such as back soreness from being ridden hard by a heavy rider or from an ill fitted saddle or girth i would look at your tack and check to be sure it fits and is adjusted properly the spookiness is going to be harder to cure this is something that probably developed because someone rode the horse and the animal spooked at something but instead of taking the time to help him get over his fears whoever rode him just either ignored him or overreacted and put him away without making him face what he was afraid of until he settled down having the vet out to check for physical problems is a good idea it's possible that the horse could be lame or sore somewhere and this is what is causing the bucking once the vet has seen the horse and any medical problems have been either treated or ruled out you can work on the spook problem to start with i would longe your horse until he's a bit tired and has had a chance to work off his energy somewhat a tired horse is less apt to act up when he's outside his comfort zone which is what you are asking him to do when you ride him anywhere except in the arena i would also take the time to sack the horse out that is rub him all over with a blanket with a plastic raincoat or with anything else you can think of that might spook him do this from the ground not from his back so he has a chance to feel and see it and get used to it before you get on him again take him for walks after longeing him for a few days and let him look around and see things if he spooks you will be in a better position to deal with it and give him some positive reinforcement when he behaves correctly while you are grooming him in the barn turn on the radio and let it play some loud music or news reports so he gets used to sounds not just sights again if he spooks when he hears this you will be there to calm him down and since he knows and trusts you anyway he is more likely to settle down after a while you can also play with him in the arena lead him up to the wall or fence and smack the wall or fence with your hands so he hears that noise this will show him that there is nothing to fear from that my mare had a problem recently with a plastic tarp which we were using to cover some hay and i took her up to the truck where the hay was and calmly picked up the tarp and rattled it repeatedly yes she spooked and pulled back at first but after a while she took it in stride and ignored what i was doing if you expose your horse to enough scary situations he will eventually get over his fears enough so that you can ride him again with some safety and confidence he will soon figure out that you aren't afraid and because he knows you are dominant he will follow your lead just make sure that you always introduce new or scary things while you are on the ground not his back both of you will be more comfortable that way not to mention safer good luck i hope this helps you  Horse tack Milton H.

what do you think about splitting the yahoo horse catagory after reading and posting here on yahoo i think we need to have two separate catagories one for real horse people who want to ask real questions and get good sound advice from knowledgeable horse people and one for all of the my friend flicka set that way they can ask and tell each other about how horses are abused and trainers cheat at shows and because of it their horse got the gate how all the halter horses that beat their horse is on steriods how they are going to the olympics in on their ponies and can post endless questions about what color their horse is and how great the conformation is what perfect riders they are how they sit around every night on the porch and sing kumbya with their horses while they plan their next million dollar foal from the stallion who was a rescue from the killer house that they helped close down the street that they got a free breeding to cannot wait to see these answers as far as year old posting on here from the yahoo terms of service age restriction children under the age of are not permitted to ask or answer questions on yahoo answers nor establish communication with other yahoo answers users to learn more about using yahoo answers safely please visit http help yahoo com l us yahoo answers safety and this is my point exactly there are a lot of us who have worked hard and been there done that we have shed the blood sweat and tears and when we tell someone how it works in the real horse world we get accused of being cruel and heartless i have answered questions about conformation and gotten told by people who cannot judge a horse by anything but color tell me i am stupid and mean because i stated that their horse was less than perfect i saw someone tell another that her horse got beat in halter because all halter people give their horses massive amounts of steriods did they ever think that maybe their horse is just not halter horse material some of my best friends are halter horse people they like seeing me enter my roping horses in their classes does it bother me to get beat because i live in the real world as lisa m stated i to have gotten emails from people who have told me that i was a b t who should have my horses taken away because i stated that you needed to pop a horse in the nose for biting instead they suggested let the horse continue to bite until he worked out his anger issues kind and gentle words should be used never agression and they even suggested anger mangement for me now why did i not think of that rockerchis i do see your point but the my friend flicka bunch is just as bad about thinking that they are far more superior to the rest of us since they have been to all of the clinics and bought all of the videos then they post a questions and go off on you when you tell them something they do not want to hear because in their mind they already know the answer they just want everyone to agree with them i have seen the kids post questions about how to improve their riding and they are good questions and usually get good answers but there is also a bunch of them who carry around a bratty attitude that they don't mind jumping down your throat when you say they are wrong or their horse is just like everyone else's average do you not agree that they need to get off their high horses also this is my definition of a real horse person someone who is willing to learn something new everyday that they own a horse people who never stop trying to better themselves and the breed people who are willing to learn from mistakes and accept criticism from those who have been there before them who are willing to ask questions and accept all answers on their merit whether they agree with them or not and not jump down someone's throat because they answer is not what you want to hear case in point i always wanted a top halter horse a top halter man told me the horse who i loved was a pos as a halter horse so i had to accept the fact that she would never win and pursue another event or sell her and find one that would work but i did not tell him he was a lying cruel sob and go look for someone to tell me what i wanted to hear monty roberts was told the same thing by don dodge that two of his training horses were crap and he dumped them and look where he is today to finish the thought good horse people listen to each other and learn forever i have learned things that i did not know from here others just want quick fixes free training sugar coating and justification on everything they do or say and then want to blame everyone when they hear the truth or things do not go their way and what happens is you see them telling someone something that could get them and a horse injured or killed and when a knowledge horse person speaks up they get blasted the whole point of this question was to make everyone think about some of the answers that they post and the attitudes that we all have myself included about being right or wrong maybe yahoo should get rid of the tumbs up down and letting people vote of best answers lisa my black beauty breyer soooo stomped all over yours ok lisa you made me feel like a ravenous wolf now heres duct tape camo of course for ken's demise i think that these people should specialize in breyers if they already haven't if you want a trainer the bratz girls are spetacular i hear that way if you need a vet its right there barbie vet if you need a farrier why theres farrier ken if you want babies well by golly you just go to walmart or local feed store and buy them then there won't be any worries about overpopulation and unwanted horses because instead of slaughterhouses you just sell them at garage sales that way we won't be ravenous wolves to those that

any ideas i would like some ideas from hunt seat and dressage trainers on how to get my large horse to move smoothly into the canter instead of explodeing forward or simply speeding up to a fast trot d any proven advice is very needed thanks i just wanted to add real quick that the reason she either tries to explode or only trot is b c i'm working at getting her to pick up the canter straight from the walk no trotting and she gets really hyped up abaout it i need methods on how to calm her down my signals are very clear and often when she ownt listen i stop and make us both take a deep breath then try again any more advice well without seeing you and your horse it is hard to give you information and help that would address your specific difficulties it sounds like you could be seesawing betweeen having your horse overly sensitive to your leg and perhaps overcollected prior to the canter depart thus the explosive depart with being alittle too passive in your seat and leg while giving him away with your hands thus his just speeding up his trot you need to find the happy medium are you sitting the trot prior to asking for the canter depart continuing to post reinforses the trot and will encourage him to speed up his trot rather than break into the canter i would encourage you to do many transitions walk to halt halt to walk walk to trot trot to halt halt to trot as well as transitions within the trot increasing and decreasing his speed the goal of these transitions is to train your horse to give you a smooth yet immediate response to your aids the more trainsitons the better when you have them down at the simpler gaits you can then proceed to the canter here the easiest transition is sitting trot to canter walk to canter and halt to canter are more difficult numerous transitions will help you achieve your goal set your horse up for the canter by picking a spot in the ring that you plan to start the canter at and then proceed to prepare for the lead by asking for the correct bend applying the correct seat and leg aids and then letting the horse move forward by giving at the appropriate time with your inside rein while keeping light contact with you outside rein try to get the canter with the lightest amount of leg and seat possible making sure you are not releasing your hand too much to soon if he just trots faster bring him back to a slower gait get him and yourself reorganized and back on the bit trotting nicely and ask again increasing your leg aid until you find the minimum amount of leg he requires to take the canter it is really similar to loading up a spring the larger the amount of compression the bigger the spring will spring the compression is achieved on the horse by a combination of seat leg and hand again with out seeing you ride it is hard to be more specific reply to additional info so there are no problems going from trot to canter well then there are possible reasons for the problem being she is over anticipating being asked for the canter so mix it up with the trot and halt so she is not sure what is coming next as well as directional changes don't ask for too many of these departs in a schooling make it a short part of your ride and mix it up the nd reason may be a lack of strength behind to engage properly and maintain being balanced build up his her base with canter work on a meter circle spiraling the circle in and then back out in both directions as well as transitions will strengthen your horse as well as some counter canter work just simple turns and holding the counterlead back to the long side of the arena to start with eventual countercanter on the short side of the arena as well in both directions  Fast bowling Equitation Carburetor Skateboarding trick Aerial (dance move)

rested and laid up until june rode again month of june early july became un sit on able again back not sore but sides are excrutiating cannot tolerate pressure on sides both horses had two constants me and the saddle girth i even used this saddle girth on a rd horse that started having similar issues he was not mine i only rode him x wk so he never got to this point and is still rideable my horses were ridden x wk mostly w t though the mare did regular canter work too no other constants i got rid of the dressage saddle and switched back to my hunter saddle with no positive results now i have a western saddle and was attempting to ride the mare in that neither horse can lunge without pain no more than that neither horse can tolerate even being requested to move forward i've been told it's behavioural by vets the saddle by others behavioural by pro trainer who talked to the vet first the unanimous opinion though from out of vets total is the saddle the true problem has never been figured out because it is their sides where your heel would thump i wonder if the girth did this i've been riding years always in my hunter saddle never had issues like this switched to that dressage saddle ruined horses something is not right here and i know it is not behavioural the mare is more expressive in her displays to get the point across and if you ask her to move forward or thump on her sides she will pin her ears strike bite cow kick double barrel when riding she would rear buck jump off the ground and squeal the gelding will buck like a rodeo bronc when pressure is applied to sides both horses were wonderful before this happened i refuse to believe it is behavioural they dont' just go from great to wretched because they feel like it i am at a loss and the team of vets on these horses university included just shake their heads and say retire them both breed the mare but don't ride breeding is not an option for me nor a desire what i want is to get my two perfect riding horses back the mare has been rested ridden by pro trainer what a nightmare that was on bute naproxen and had been shockwaved xrays were taken she is awaiting the chiro now i am awaiting some to pay him i just love going to the barn to stare at my horses that i am paying board on every month this really sucks and i am at a total loss with this i can't even sit on them bareback as the pressure against their sides is too much continuation they are both outside sometimes the gelding comes into a stall for the winter on the coldest days the mare doesn't toelrate being stalled well they have been moved to a different facility and yes to all of you who have been jumping up about the naviuclar that gelding has been retired haven't you read that he has been off and rested for months so far he has not been ridden save for time in january when the pro trainer came out to ride them both the navicular is being maintained as best as i can and he is one daily medications the gelding was treated for lyme's disease i forgot about that in addition to all the other things i have done i have been an equine veterinary technician for nearly years and have been a rider owner for years i would never put my horses at risk by doing something silly like riding a nav horse he gets xrays of his feet every months to keep track of his condition he is vigorously monitored well i find it hard to believe the neoprene girth could cause such soreness i believe that if a horse was irritated by something like a girth there would be some localized swelling or some type of blistering that would give the area a slight scurf i know what trouble it can be when a saddle fit is not right but personally i have found if it was the saddle my horse would show enough back soreness within a week to let me know this was the problem saddle must be constantly monitored because as horses either gain muscle or topline through training or lose muscle or topline through old age or loss of training the saddle can need adjustment in its flocking also of course tree fit is important but again i would think these problems should have surfaced very quickly and given the time complete rest to recover which you seem to have done and a proper fitting saddle the problem would be gone by now which it isn't in the case of your older horse he seems to have enough other problems arthritis navicular that perhaps it is time to retire him the mare however is lacking in these problems yet still is unrideable you certainly seem to have done it all a good chiropractor may be able to shed some light if the mare has never seen one so as soon as you can afford it i would check it out one other option is to check your horses for lymes disease if you haven't already done so the vet will simply draw a blood this too is worth a try because treatment with antibiotic will solve the problem if they have a positive titer for lymes good luck read a post below mine insisting that this was a severe behavior problem without physically seeing these horses the poster might have gone a little overboard but my one question to you amanda is how long have you owned the gelding if it has been for a very long time i would be less apt to think it is a behavioral problem if you only had the gelding for months before problems started which seems to be the same amount of time the mare went well for you it may be a case where a physical problem has created a behavioral one especially in the mares case as i said earlier the geldings other physical issues even with all your good care and medication are probably not surmountable if it is behavioral horses can certainly take advantage of you if they think they are the ones in control i might look to a less conventional type of professional to evaluate my horse any john lyons clinics where you are  Weight training Milton H.

how big is too big what is the weight limit for a person to ride a horse i know that being overweight can hurt your horse how big is too big for a full size horse spotted saddle horse i am just asking a question not referring to myself i was just wondering if someone else wanted to ride my horse and they were a bigger person they say a horse can safely carry about of their weight so a horse should have a rider no more than on it i would think this would vary depending on what is being asked of the horse my husband weighs a little over and has been on a percheron cross and a quarter horse that was right around h all he did was walk i don't think this was too much to ask for these horses he did trot on the percheron that horse weighed and was hands tall he tried to get on my h paint at the time but it couldn't carry him well probably a result of the saddle not being the best i would imagine if your overweight rider wanted to cowboy into the sunset over hill and dale then this would be a real problem if he was on a horse however even an hour or so of walking around that shouldn't be a problem the rider's weight should be taken in account depending upon the amount of work you are asking the horse to do galloping jumping hills pavement vs grass these are all factors to consider into the equation too  Horse Equine conformation Horse gait Horse tack Equitation Eventing Dressage Bicycle Mountain bike Cowboy Arabian horse Milton H.

correct posting trot which video has the more correct posting trot for hunters how can i teach myself to move like that i know rise with the leg on the wall and do point and all that so just tell me how to move with my hips http www youtube com watch v g bjaae p w http www youtube com watch v twjocwanrjw http www youtube com watch v hu bqrzqyva if you have another video then that would help me a lot thank you all right this was a trick question i am disappointed with the answer the second one has the best posting trot she is with the movement of her horse and she is straight but angled a bit forward her legs are back and still look at the rider in this picture http horses about com od learntoride ht postthetrot htm see the angle of her back and the arc of her hip first of all you have to realize that different disciplines and even different judges different trainers etc have different ideas about how the posting trot should look in the first video she is showing in an english pleasure class most likely at a aqha breed show where it seems like the majority of the riders aren't as concerned with their equitation because the class is mostly judged on the horse hence pleasure class the horse is supposed to be a 'pleasure' to ride and ride on a loose rein etc she's a little too vertical for my taste almost seems like she's posting straight up and down versus posting with her hips forward in the second video she has more of a hunter style post her hips are angled more forward she's not posting up she's posting forward with her hips and not really gripping with her knees so her lower leg is staying connected with the horse's side in the third video she's way over exaggerating her post throwing herself forward almost over the pommel of her saddle plus she's got piano crab hands which is just extremely unattractive her lower leg is too far forward much like a chair seat which could be prevented if she didn't post so forcefully and she's probably gripping with her knees which throws her lower leg forward infront of her rather than underneather of her another thing you can try to practice especially to keep your hands steady you can use one of those big exercise balls straddle it and practice posting that way try videoing yourself that way you can see your flaws and compare yourself to videos like these  Horse Dressage Aerial (dance move) Equitation Professional wrestling holds Skateboarding trick Hunt seat Horse gait Professional wrestling throws Show hunter Swingout Breaststroke Boxing Show jumping Fencing Horse tack Backstroke Glossary of climbing terms Fast bowling Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Marching band Bicycle Weight training Professional wrestling aerial techniques Strap-on dildo Casualty lifting Obedience training Milton H.

what does a horse do in a halter class showmanship patterns are usually posted on the gate outside the arean or the judge will tell you the pattern when you get inside halter classes are the same generally but often you wont have patterns you simply have to make your horse stand square trot half the areana or back upon command when asked to by the judge but some judges treat halter classes the same as showmanship or maybe you meant showmanship when you talk about halter classes showmanship you may be asked to to a piviot back trot halt and square up always remember in showmanship and halter classes never touch your horse to ask it to do a command i e if you lay your hand on the horses shoulder to ask it to back you'll have points taken away good luck  Horse tack Horse Obedience training Equitation Equine conformation Milton H.

my school horse share your stories and answer my question please i've recently started lessons and i've fallen in love with the horse i'm on she's a buckskin quarter horse mare after a few months of riding i'm thinking of asking my instructor if i can ride her a bit out side of lessons what do you think if you have any stories about your horse or the school horse you ride please share them and also give your opinion for my question thanx in advance first you should definitely ask your instructor see if the horse that you're riding needs to be ridden outside of your lessons if she is under exercised on the days that you're not riding when you're really comfortable with her have a talk with your instructor ask her if you might be able to take the horse out on a couple of trail rides with another more advanced rider or another instructor ask her questions about what the mare is like on the trails remember before you go out on the trails you should be perfect at a walk and trot and be able to canter and jump at least a small fence this is for your safety once you've been riding out on the trails for a while and you're comfortable with it try to take the tests and apply for a license for riding on the trails on your own ask your instructor about getting a license as well even if you don't eventually get to ride her completely on your own still grab any opportunity to ride her during breaks that you have if you're in school lease her see if you can lease her for one or two weeks a full lease take the responsibility it's a great opportunity it will give you the chance to really experience owning a horse muck out the stall handle feeding and treats turn her out take her to the field for grass ride her in all of the lessons that you can and alone clean her tack and tack her up and untack her everything is a new adventure with horses basically take any chance that you get to be around her you never know someday you may be looking to buy a horse and the experience will have been very valuable to you i ride many many school horses i've had some good and bad experiences though one of the girls that i ride with is a pretty good rider and she rides some of the toughest horses at the stable i've seen her thrown and bucked and reared once a horse even bolted out of the door of the inside ring and right into the courtyard it was scary she was also testing for a higher level and in the warm up before the test her horse threw her and when she was still on the ground the horse stepped on her arm ouch i've also had an experience when i was bolted by a hugeee horse that was scary once when i was helping out around the stable my friend and i heard this clatter of hooves and all these people running around we ducked out of the barn and saw all of these people running towards the street with treats and hay a horse had escaped a paddock jumped the fence and trampled a whole field of tulips and gotten into the street i've also had amazing experiences the nervousness of testing i've even gotten a ribbon for top of the class once and once i got the opportunity to ride this white horse along the beach cantering it was amazing anyway this is already long have fun all the best nicky  Equine conformation Hunt seat Horse tack Eventing Seabiscuit Martial art Cross-country equestrianism Motorcycle Milton H.

i think i know somewhere in me that i am not enough of a rider to deal with a bad ankle and this horse but i'm not going to stop riding him because of that because i'm that stupid and i love him that much honestly all it would take is a word to kayla and i could ride any of the other horses but i need to learn to ride this horse well or i will lose it is this incredibly stupid or not should i stop riding this horse until i figure out how to fix up my ankle or should i be stubborn and work through it just a warning suggesting the doctor is always nice and yes i realize one person has always done it and i should have put this up earlier but i have like a clinical phobia of doctors so unless my ankle quits out two more times my set limit was four i'm just gonna od on tylenol okay so y'all seem to think quitting on that horse for awhile is a good idea but really if i quit riding him now i'm not quite sure i'll ever get back on him because in some ways he scares me and if i quit i dunno if i have the willpower and confidence to start on him again i would fix your ankle or risk not being able to ride a horse at all by riding with a bad ankle your not riding properly your compensating in some way which is not good for your learning process and is not good for the horse besides do you really want to fall break your neck and never be able to walk again much less be able to ride  Equine conformation The Dalek Invasion of Earth Horse Milton H.

bucked off the other day i was working with my green broke gelding the past few weeks he has been going great he is fairly quiet he spooks occasionally but it is always been controllable he has great ground manners but is very high energy and kind of high strung i got on him like always he stood quietly while i mounted he took a few steps at the walk then took off trying to bolt on me i pulled him into a circle to get him to stop and he started to bronco buck on me he was running and bucking about half the length of the arena feet before i bailed fell i was too scared to get back on him but i lunged him for about an hour after he dumped me i have not taken a bad fall from a horse in forever and now i'm older it isn't like it used to be i used to 'bounce' i would fall off and be able to jump back on with no problems well now that isn't the case i can hardly get out of bed i am so bruised up and sore continued any thoughts on why my horse who has never bucked before would go off like this i broke him out and have done all his training so far and i have always felt he is unpredictable but never really dangerous i now feel like unpredictable bucking me going to end up in a coma soon he is naturally very athletic when he is good he is like a dream to work with but he will randomly spaz out and now that he is bucking i am scared of his spaz moments i originally thought he was going to be an amazing dressage horse now i feel like if he will be so incredibly spooky at home he will never be a decent show horse when he flipped out on me i was riding in the same tack as always in the same arena as always there was nothing caught under his saddle and there were no bugs out really he does things when i was cantering him a week ago and he spooked so bad at a shadow on the ground he almost fell over no one at my barn will get on him they all consider him psychotic i like high strung horses but not unpredictable horses he is unpredictable but i wouldn't call him psycho a trainer is not an option i ride as well as the only trainer in my area that will take arabs sending him to a farther away barn is not an option i know for a fact they will never ride him and will screw me out of my money he hasn't been ridden since my fall on saturday as much as it upsets me to sell him i think that is going to be my only option my husband is having major issues with me riding this horse he thinks i am going to end up paralyzed b c of this horse and he wont let it drop would you deal with a horse like this or get rid of it i am so down right now i was so optomistic for a while thinking he was doing so well and proving people wrong then he just flips out the scary thing is he showed no warning he was going to take off bucking he was perfectly happy the entire time i was tacking him up lunging him before and getting on hi now bucking it is a fun thing for a horse to do as long as you aren't on him my question to you is how often does this horse get to play free time how many days do you ride how many days had it been since you had ridden him how old is he arabs are late bloomers slow to mature and it would be a shame to give up a potentially nice horse when a young horse bucks after being basically trained it is usually because he just want to have fun it was very wise of you to round pen him hard after that episode i suggest since you do not feel confident to get back on him that you round pen him everyday to a sweat give him some free time but not in the arena where you plan to ride you don't want him to think it is ahis playground a round pen or paddock is better for playtime when you are feeling better and you will round pen him to a sweat under saddle before you ride to get the jiggys out of him that way you don't go for a play time bucking session with him eventually he will stop when he is good reward him with a nice rub down grooming or treat not by hand he will remember this when he is bad mannered tie him some place safe and let him stand alone for an hour or so hope this helps sorry for your bad luck it sucks being dumped i know from exp  Poker jargon Horse tack Shaggy dog story Social rule Theory of conduct 2000 Australian Grand Prix Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dressage Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Seabiscuit Aerial (dance move) Milton H.

i cannot feel safe on a lunge line is there a way to make me feel safe on one when someone else is in control of the horse i'm riding i just cannot make myself feel safe comfortable so whenever the trainer tries to put me on one to help with something i freeze up i think part of it is that i have always ridden horses who like to run and therefore i don't feel like i can be alright unless i have the reins in my hands and i'm in control of everything does anyone have any idea how i could become more comfortable riding on a lunge line i don't even do work on a lunge line that often it's just that when something comes up that i need to be on a lunge line to help me learn i freeze up and can't learn it which is a problem have you addressed this with your instructor really talked about how afraid you are feeling in that situation if you have and your instructor has not offered you help then i would ask your instructor if you could start with that extra rein as described before keep hold of a rein not taunt enough to interfere with the the instructors queues but enough to where you feel you can take control if something were to happen have your instructor work with you this way until you feel confident enough to release that rein you have to be willing to push yourself though don't take the lesson and refuse to let go of it if you have been going around for minutes this way you need to tell yourself that you are safe and can push through the fear so that you can progress forward good luck  Milton H.

dressage question is height really a requirement or judged in dressage my tb is is he too small i know most dressage riders ride those big horses but is there anything wrong with riding a smaller horse your horse if fine for heighth most people ride the bigger horses because it gives them bigger strides to do dressage however i've seen little ' arabs kick the warmbloods butts so as long as your horse can do what is asked heighth is not an issue good luck  Dressage Horse Equine conformation Eventing Equitation Arabian horse Show hunter Lipizzan Show jumping Andalusian horse Horse gait Connemara pony Horse tack Hunt seat American Quarter Horse Charisma (horse) Warmblood Akhal-Teke Whip Trakehner Selle Fran__ais Bridle Recumbent bicycle Horse show Pony Oldenburg (horse) Hanoverian (horse) Kinsky horse Lucinda Green Reining Holstein (horse) Thoroughbred Netherlands at the 2004 Summer Olympics Mountain biking Friesian horse Switzerland at the 2004 Summer Olympics Traveller (horse) Germany at the 2004 Summer Olympics Human animal roleplay (BDSM) Vault (gymnastics) Great Britain at the 2004 Summer Olympics Tennessee Walker John Wayne Bullfighting Domestication of the horse Standardbred horse Saint Nicholas Trot (horse gait) Cowboy Big Ben (horse) Climbing specialist (cycling) European Eventing Championship United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics Scopes Trial Noseband Stirrup Cross-country skiing Six Flags Over Texas Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Skateboarding trick Chocobo Martial art Disneyland Hurdling Seabiscuit Ireland at the 2004 Summer Olympics Bull riding Horse breaking Fast bowling Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Stage (bicycle race) Wyatt Earp Austria at the 2004 Summer Olympics Aerial (dance move) Roller coaster Denmark at the 2004 Summer Olympics Crop (implement) Brazil at the 2004 Summer Olympics Apology (Plato) Rolex Kentucky Three Day Gambling Martingale (tack) Big Thunder Mountain Railroad Tour de France Montgomery Bus Boycott Master of the Horse Knoebels Ghost Rider Grumpy's Three Wishes Breaker Morant Theory of conduct Arab-Israeli conflict Gliding Altruism Dog agility The Catcher in the Rye High-heeled shoe Space Mountain Kalki

horse care products i've been hoping forever that i'll finally be able to own my own horse one day its becoming nearer and nearer in reach my dad is getting a raise and business plans are getting better so next year he says that we'll be able to get a horse most likely i'm very excited i have a horse i'm hoping for but she may as well be sold by then sadly i know quite a few things about horses but not everything whe the day comes where i get to go out and buy grooming supplies and begin looking at tack and stuff what are your favorite brands of supplies and tack from flie spray to brushes to saddles tell me what you recomend and what all do you buy that is nesicarry that probably sounds dumb but really i'd like a list thanks ok let's see if i can think of everything off the top of my head grooming i like to have a soft bristled brush stiff bristled brush rubber curry comb metal curry comb or shedding blade hoof pick the kind with the brush on one side long plastic comb pulling comb if you plan on showing show sheen or some other shine detangler spray small bucket sponge shampoo sweat scraper the kind with the rubber squeegee sort of thing are the best and there's a thing called a slick n easy grooming block that's also good to have great for getting rid of bot flies i used to use a brand of shampoo conditioner detangler called sunsheild it smelled great and helped keep the horse's coat from fading in the sun however i haven't seen it sold anywhere in a long time i'm not sure if it's made anymore if you can find it though i highly recommend it what brand of brushes eh i honestly don't think it matters that much don't waste your money on super expensive brushes just make sure that you have a soft brush that's gentle enough to use on the horse's face for fly spray i think repel x was what i used a lot i've tried a ton of different brands some worked ok some worked great for a little while and then stopped working and some didn't work at all i never had any luck with bronco i tried endure mosquito halt and supershield green and all worked fairly well if i remember correctly but were pricier i think repel x was my favorite though i bought a huge bottle of concentrate you just add it to a certain amount of water in a spray bottle which lasted forever and was way cheaper that way you'll also want to get some swat it's a cream that you can put on scrapes and cuts they happen sometimes to keep flies off it comes in pink and clear get the clear unless you don't mind having fluorescent pink spots on your horse along with that you should have some sort of horsey first aid kit with vet wrap and anything else that may be necessary in case of emergency you'll need to deworm your horse every weeks i like ivermectin wormers you can buy them generic for cheaply or there's also zimectrin which is a good brand we used to also worm my horses once a year with safeguard it's good to rotate wormers there are several different effective ways of doing this you'll probably want to get your horse a blanket for the winter if you don't clip and don't live in an extremely cold environment you may just need a light sheet at the most most horses can do fine without a blanket i think more than anything it makes you feel better knowing your baby is nice and warm other things hmm polo wraps you can find all kinds of cool fun colors and patterns or go with the simple classic white you'll need a fly mask i like the ordinary fly masks that farnam makes they're a good thick material that doesn't get torn too easily and they have fleece around the edges for comfort i tried a mask that had ears on it once and my pony hated it i had to cut them off to keep him from rubbing it off all the time some horses don't mind it though obviously you'll need a halter and lead rope i like leather halters myself but nylon halters are great too if you want some color just make sure that if you plan to turn your horse out to pasture with a halter on that you use a leather halter it's dangerous to turn a horse out with a nylon halter since they won't break should the horse get tangled for a lead rope get one of those round poly lead ropes like this http www statelinetack com itemdy asp t slt bgu avoid the flat nylon leads they can burn your hands a lot worse if the horse pulls the rope through your hands don't get a lead with a chain unless you need the chain which for your first horse i really hope you wouldn't you want to be able to hold the lead rope next to where it attaches to the halter comfortably and holding onto a chain isn't comfortable without knowing more about what kind of riding you do i don't know what to suggest as far as bridle saddle etc one thing i can tell you though is don't waste your money on cheap leather save your money and buy a nicer quality saddle or get a synthetic saddle wintec saddles are awesome if you ride english get a shaped fleece pad unless you ride dressage in which case a square quilted pad would be a good choice for western i like a navajo pad they're not expensive come in all sorts of colors and i even used mine with my dressage saddle sometimes i like neoprene girths cinches they're easy to clean and are comfy for the horse also get a girth that has elastic on the end if you ride english get a bridle that has either web or laced reins plain reins are harder to hold on to if you ride western i like a plain harness leather one ear headstall with split reins for normal riding it's simple looks nice and inexpensive for showing i used to have a beautiful light oil headstall with rawhide and horsehair trim it was gorgeous that's all i can think of right now there's always more stuff to buy it'll seem like you're always needing to make a trip to the tack store

arabian halter and showmanship showing yea i know in huntseat you use your bridle but in western do you use this http www arabhorsestore com store images gazal al shaqab jpg or do you use this which i use on my quarter horse http www horselegs com show halters turquoise light oil html thanks even in western you could use any of the ones that you posted or one like the first person had posted i would not use a stock horse halter as it would take away from you arabians chizzled and delicate face features it would make your horses features harder to be seen by a judge in confirmation classes the first one you posted is a not so traditional but very arabian show halter you could certainly use a halter like that i would suggest using one like the first person posted that is a more traditional halter that will be more compatible with a western outfit that is what most people use when showing in western attire you could look up pictures of arabian halter classes to get a better idea of the attire and halters in the arabian classes i am sure you know how to set an arabian horse front feet square and the left back leg set slightly further back than the right your horse shouldn't look like its body is all stretch or parked just a nice lengthy neck good luck and have fun  Equine conformation Horse tack Horse Arabian horse HyperText Transfer Protocol Professional wrestling holds American Quarter Horse Horse gait Bridle Milton H.

curb chain we were wondering if you mount from the left as a tradition from when men wore swords and we ride on the left to be able to effectively draw weapons if challenged everything is fastened on the left so it can be easily checked before mounting i guess why the devil does the curb chain fasten on the right it's fixed on the left the hook is closed it's brand new and when we thought about it all the ones we know either fasten that way or come right off mine has a leather strap attached to the chain so that it can fasten on either side but i'm aware of the ones you're referring to interesting question i really don't know xd perhaps they didn't fasten that way in medieval times and now it's evolved over the centuries to be like that maybe curb chains were once fastened from the left and the act slowly switched over time so that they were fastened from the right for some reason again really good question i'll try to do some research and see if i can find anything for now i give you a star for bringing this up edit grr still nothing this is a toughy i thought of this while researching though stablehands held the horse for the knight when mounting did they not i mean that chainmail must've been heavy and the act of getting up in the saddle difficult for a fully armored man the stablehands might've been standing on the right side and they would fasten the chain as a final measure before letting the horse go out onto the battlements doesn't really make sense but it's a thought xd  Horse tack Armour Chainmail Rigging Professional wrestling match types Rail tracks Archery Stryker Skinhead Cowboy Strap-on dildo Cavalry Chariot Coat of Arms of Lithuania Bull riding Glossary of nautical terms Bow (weapon) English longbow Equine conformation Upholstery Shirt God of War Firearm Anchor Medieval warfare Gag (BDSM) Colours, standards and guidons Team Fortress Classic Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Appeal Billboard (advertising) Plate armour Social rule Tire Crash test dummy Timpani Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Order of the Garter Sewing machine Socrates Undergarment Martial art Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Milton H.

best thing to feed my horse my horse is very healthy i ride her everyday and there is no way she is under weight but during the winter where i live it gets about below for about weeks there are some bery harsh winters and i dont ride her as often because its so cold and during the winter i feed her as much hay as she can eat but she still doesn't keep her weight on so i was wondering if anyone new of any grain feed besides oats that i could give her to keep her weight good for winter well she needs to be supplemented with a good quality pellet it won't freeze together like a sweet feed will in cold temps i like nutrena safechoice but any high fat high fiber pellet will work you may also want to add some alfalfa pellets and rice bran for added calories to help her maintain her weight in the cold make sure you start feeding her before it gets really cold so that she doesn't lose any weight before it starts getting bad and you can get her used to her feed by gradually increasing her rations you can even mix her pellets with warm water if you get concerned about her water intake when it is really cold make sure to continue rotational deworming and have an equine loose mineral source available at all times also possibly blanket her when the temps are extremely cold it will help her maintain her body temperature  Dietary fiber Dieting Guinea pig Bread Domestic rabbit Milk Beer Breastfeeding Bodybuilding Veganism Carburetor Atkins Nutritional Approach Bran Capercaillie Water E85 Hamster Cereal Tofu Omega-3 fatty acid Temperature Vegetarianism Hormone replacement therapy (trans) South Beach diet Diseases of the honeybee Low-carbohydrate diet Folic acid Maize Soybean Chicken Robert Falcon Scott Nutrition Tocopherol Equine conformation Obesity Alcoholic beverage Carbon dioxide Brewery Tea Thermoregulation Rice Bird migration Anorexia nervosa Severe weather terminology (United States) Alfalfa Ice cream Weight training Food guide pyramid Horse Fancy rat Ocean thermal energy conversion Explosive material Super Size Me Weather lore Magnesium Genetically modified food Vermicompost Foie gras Water (molecule) Warm-blooded Chocolate Wheat Protein-energy malnutrition Carbon dioxide sink Jet engine Tlingit Diesel engine Calorie restriction Calorie Global warming and agriculture Ecology Solar power Thermal power station Egg (food) Food Goldfish Shotgun Fish farming Ceramics Sugar substitute Iron Vitamin C Raw food diet Portland cement Comanche Degree Fahrenheit Desert Hypothermia Horse colic Weight loss Sake Horseshoe Climate of India Dairy farming Little Ice Age Fecal incontinence

reminder in the posting trot in my posting trot i go upwards instead of forwards for four years now that is how long i have been riding i can see my toes and i know that is bad do you know of any excerises i can do at home or reminders i can think when i am riding i really do want to become a better rider and i know it is an upward forward rolling motion and that keeps your leg back and quiet how should i feel once i get it right tilted forward or straight backed here are some pictures http i photobucket com albums aa jazzy horse chance gable post jpg http i photobucket com albums aa jazzy horse chance gable may trot jpg http i photobucket com albums aa jazzy horse chance rio trot jpg http i photobucket com albums aa jazzy horse chance rio trot jpg http i photobucket com albums aa jazzy horse chance gable trotting jpg continued in the pictures with the bay it was from lasyt year and yearly this year and some of them are with long stirrups i think since then on my new horse the paint rio i have tried to keep my toes in the pictures with the paint are from two weeks ago i had just got him so my leg is waay too forward but now they are getting back but i still see my toe videos with correct posting trot will help bunches thanks the paint with his old owners used to do speed events and barrel racing and he wasn't fast enough so they spurred him and so he doesn't like your leg behind him and he is a little fast about my saddle a riser pad fixed the problem my trainer let me borrow one and it works she would have told me and let me borrow a lesson saddle if not thank you for your concern though and i have since then shortened my stirrups and tried to turn in my toes not degrees any more more like so i still need a little work sorry i don't have any updated pictures but i just wanted to show you that i was making the common mistake of posting up instead of posting with the horse and posting forward and a little up also it makes no difference weather you are in dressage or hunters the way you post should be the same not straight up and now and slapping your butt into the saddle when you come down dressage riders should have that rolling with the horse movement also ok one shorten your stirrups they are too long second try bending more at your hips almost like a two point and try bringing your shoulders a bit more forward which once you shorten your stirrups alot of this will be where you need to be anyways ride with no stirrups posting trot this will kill you so dont' do alot to start with and also try two point no stirrups you'll be surprised how fast you get it right good luck and hope this helps  Horse gait Dressage Horse tack High-heeled shoe Cowboy Show jumping Aerial (dance move) Backstroke Professional wrestling holds Equitation Boxing Show hunter Stirrup Skateboarding trick Hunt seat Swingout Cowboy boot Comanche Glossary of ballet terms Marching band Recumbent bicycle Drill bit Standardbred horse Parade (military) Oasis (band) The Amazing Race Ayrton Senna Three Stooges Lindy Basic Butterfly stroke Poker jargon Eventing Breaststroke Diving Jazz Bicycle Double bass Professional wrestling attacks Captain Thunderbolt Kitesurfing Front crawl The Ashlee Simpson Show B-47 Stratojet Hey Jude Glossary of climbing terms Tennessee Walker Obedience training Harness racing Horizontal bar EastEnders FoxTrot Mouse (computing) Battles of Lexington and Concord Knife Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Archery Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Bicycle brake systems Snowboarding Red Hot Chili Peppers Cross-country equestrianism Rod Stewart Ice hockey Might and Power American Quarter Horse Snowboard American Saddlebred Traveller (horse) Mountain bike Fell pony John Wayne Charleston (dance move) Helicopter Pole vault Shaggy dog story New York Knicks Frankie Laine Guilty Gear Weight training Hip hop music Jennifer Lopez American Pie (song) Wassily Kandinsky Softball Swimming Piccolo Junior Saga Strap-on dildo Sport rowing Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Trot (horse gait) Lipizzan Side pass (dance move)

is there any cure for side bone in horses can you ride the horse are there any special shoe jobs you can do i am looking at this horse because the mare is the mother to my gelding she is currently a broodmare is there any hope for this mare thank you just to let you know sidebone isn't the same as ring bone contrary to your first answer this condition is defined as the laying down of calcium ossification in the cartilage wings of the pedal bone this is caused by increased concussive forces on the back of the pedal bone which will predispose to sidebone formation and is a result of poor or delayed shoeing andlong periods of work on hard surfaces i would get the vet out there to look at the horse if sidebone is the causing lameness grooving the hoof will allow the foot to expand and relieve pain if the sides of the hoof are putting pressure on the ossification otherwise rest and treatment with nsaids is probably the best course of action the key to not developing lameness in these horses is to keep them trimmed and keep lots of room for heel expansion i would get the vet to x ray the horse so you can see if it really is side bone and if so how much ossification there is if the horse is in no apparent pain then i wouldn't see any reason not to ride her but make sure to get the vet to look at her before you buy her just to make sure you are buying a healthy and sound horse good luck  Equine conformation Laminitis Horseshoe Osteoarthritis Bone Horse Mandible High-heeled shoe Paget's disease of bone Decompression sickness Traumatic brain injury Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Temporal bone Cancer Horse gait Professional wrestling holds Tetrapod Evidence of evolution Skull Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Vomer bone Palatine bone Scapula Arabian horse Osteoporosis Frontal bone Ethmoid bone Stomach cancer Fast bowling Cephalic disorder Endochondral ossification Radiation therapy Chronic fatigue syndrome Tooth Ulna Sternum Rheumatoid arthritis Milton H.

where is the best place to buy fencing supplies i just bought a new farm that has acres currently there is barbed wire and the corners consist of really thick railroad type ties i live in central minnesota around the st cloud area i have about horses and a couple of cows i want to redo all of the fencing where can i get the best yet most economical fencing at i had on my old farm inch electric poly tape with wood fence posts and t posts i now have barns but i am only going to be utilizing for my horses they are located around the house if anyone has any suggestions or whatever let me know i could use any tips congrats on your new farm if the fence posts are salvageable why not just take down the barbed wire and reuse the posts you can always replace and or brace up any areas that need work if it were me i'd be leery of using tape or other weak electric fence for the outside perimeter of your property too easy for something to break the fence and then your livestock is on the highway bad liability issue plus a real danger to your animals an alternative is to use something sturdy for perimeter then cheaper stuff for cross fencing a neighbor of mine uses electro braid on wooden posts with wood post elec insulators it looks very orderly and neat and is cheap compared to wood pvc or centaur fence also it has a much higher break strength than tape yet is still visible not great contrast against snow but horses learn that where there are posts there is hot wire  Barbed wire Seismic retrofit Agricultural fencing Plastic Livestock Knife Dairy Cattle Drill bit Wood Mattress Straw-bale construction Welding Violin Tesla coil Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Naval mine Comanche Overhead powerline Poker jargon Solar cell Solar power Elis Prefecture Rail tracks Wrigley Field Equine conformation Coaxial cable Agriculture Hamster Cowboy Sword Table saw Wildfire Energy development Spark plug Israeli West Bank barrier Milton H.

i have two yr old percheron mares that are months pregnant is it safe to induce both mares were bred early july of last year we checked breeding dates with the vet both were bred a i this is their first pregnancy one of the mares is completely ready to foal and has been for about a week and she's starting to lose weight i think we should induce labor for both but i've never experienced anything like this so wasn't sure if anyone has had a similar situation before okay guess i wasn't clear with the details i mispoke and said they were yrs old i mean they were bred when they were three also i have had the vet out last week and he says that the foals are fine both are alive and kicking one of the foals has even moved into the birth canal also we've had a bit of a drought here and lately it's been really stormy so i was thinking that could affect them also they were bred to and oldenberg stallion if that helps thanks for all the help we're inducing one of the mares tonight we have a baby turned out the mare wouldn't deliver because the colt had gotten his legs all twisted and what not took the vet twenty minutes to straighten him out anywho we have a baby thank you for all of the help by now it would be a miracle that the foals would be alive were the mares positively identified as being infoal by a vet if the mares are truely in foal then you have to worry about septicemia systemic infection from the dead foals yup get them into the vet have them induced and you may have some hefty medical bills on your hand for post treatment  Horse Childbirth Pregnancy Guinea pig Breastfeeding Equine conformation Abortion Thoroughbred Intact dilation and extraction Welsh Cob (Section D) Friends Sunday Silence Dog Obstetrics Abortion debate Neighbours Breech birth Domestication of the horse Miscarriage Pet skunk Welsh pony of cob type (Section C) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Clydesdale (breed) Days of our Lives Acne Fancy rat New York Giants Psoriasis Avvakum Knots Landing Heinkel He 112 Premature birth Multiple sclerosis Elephant Arabian horse Menstrual cycle AIDS Birth weight Seabiscuit Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Asthma Killian documents Charmed Charisma (horse) Clinical depression Chlorpromazine Coeliac disease Kakapo Autism Herpes simplex virus Drowning Androgen insensitivity syndrome Aerial (dance move) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Prenatal diagnosis Milton H.

please help whats wrong with my horse since march this year my horse's behaviour is getting worse she's been taken off grass in case of staggers treated for stomach ulcers on a magnezium replacement and had hundreds spent on massage bowen and choirpractor type sessions she's bucking heavy not wanting to go foreward and has a short stride while riding she is also becoming uncontrolable while leading often rearing and trying to bolt it is not a dominance issue it has something to do with pain because she is not happy expecially walking down hills where she will actually hold her breath on occasion the vet keeps guessing whats wrong and my finances are running out she is normally a wonderful horse to be around and happy in her work which is mainly dressage no one seems to be able to help her and i am beyound frustration now i'm even starting to think i may have to put her down we live in rotorua new zealand wow did'nt expect so many replies thanks she is yo not shod and behaves best with me rather than anyone else the vet and myself have lunged her and yes she has been on pain killers which helped hugely but we havn't found the cause although i'm sure most the pain is coming from her hind quarters i will organise to have the mri thing and hopefully that gives us some answers thanks so much for all your help good job on all the treatments you have tried do they have nuclear medicine at any of the vet schools in your area personally that would be the next choice if she was a human would be to nm her and see if she had athritis areas of inflammation broken or healing bones etc that does cost alot of money and i know and can understand with your finances dwindling but i would check around ask the vet to refer you and see if there is a place over there that has one you may have to put her down sadly its so hard when animals can't talk to us but you are thinking about her wellbeing and i give you a big hug for that its a hard decision  Equine conformation Stomach cancer Horse Theory of conduct Dressage Osteoarthritis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Horse gait Shaggy dog story Prostate cancer 2000 Australian Grand Prix Fast bowling Milton H.

senior feed i have a yr old retired barrel mare she is pretty running horse bred granddaughter of lady bugs moon she has a nice belly on her and is in general good weight she gets a timothy alfalfa mix for hay and she had been getting purina equine sr because i was not happy with how she looked i switched her to nutrena senior it's her topline all the way back from withers to hips her top line protrudes she is de wormed regularly rotating wormers she is turned out hrs day she gets joint supplement has anyone had experience with these feeds or another they liked the results on better i tried a local feed when i first moved here months ago but her tongue was swelling so i switched back to the national brands i was thinking on just switching to the nutrena vitality a sweet feed thoughts a little snarky are we anna thanks m r shay for the input good god m r i hope not a heart condition i need her to hang around another years for my own mental well being shay her hocks are fusing together at the central joint some days she is better than others we do trail ride mostly walking about once a week and about once a month or so we do some arena exercises and i usually let her go through a pattern at her own speed she absolutely hates being relegated to retirement but no there is no structured exercise for her it is a common condition in older horses without proper stimulation the muscles cannot build up to the point of covering the skeletal structure if she is retired i understand that but is she arthritic if not i always recommend to have all horses in an excersise program nothing stressful just trotting you can purchase expana reins the stretch reins used to train a proper head set if she naturally carries her head about her whithers but she needs to trot times weekly with her head slightly below her whithers to encourage the muscles along her neck back and croup to stimulate and build senior feed if wonderful as it has the lsightly increased protein they need and usually are made to be digested easily i am not sure about that type of feed but a senior feed that is not corn based is the best way to go i use xtn and vitality for my horses corn is the main cause of colic founder and most other gastric upset issues and is sometimes not easily digested by horses that would be the direction i would go but you are right not to put a load of supplements into her if she starts becoming stiff ask your vet about corta rx its a miracle worker and a simple glucosamine complex its sold only to vets but you can get a years supply for half the cost of most over the counter supplements is my payment but every vet is different you can ask him if he doesnt usually carry it if he can get it to you for 'cost' good luck but just remember most elderly horses have this situation if you have seen horses that look when they are that is the exception not the rule  Horse gait Osteoarthritis Weight training Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Dressage Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fancy rat Welding Horse tack Milk Eye Rail terminology Massage Atkins Nutritional Approach Chicken Horseshoe Professional wrestling holds Insulin Dog Laminitis Horse colic Cat Organic farming Arabian horse Carburetor Clinical depression Car handling Exercise Thermal power station Mattress Gas metal arc welding Aerial (dance move) Traumatic brain injury M16 (rifle) Creatine The Contender (television series) Milton H.

barrel racers do you do this i don't do alot of extra things for my horse in the way of suppliments for my horse they are healthy and well taken care of but my question is this i have a friend who is always adding things to her horses feed giving injections for this or that and then she gripes because her horse won't work for her i think she is doing to much to him and he has all this crap in him and he doesn't know what to do she trys all the new gimmicks to make your horse do this or that i don't get it never have i have noticed this alot in our profession and my friend is a very good horsewoman and i don't get how she doesn't see that all this crap is hurting her horse i have tried to talk to her but she doesn't or won't hear me girls guys any answers whew i am so glad i am not the only one that feels this way i know some suppliments are needed but for the most part it is over kill thanks for your great answers all but one and you all know who that is i know of several people doing the same sorts of things those dang injections seems like everyone wants to give them 'cause every horse out there has a hock problem one girl does this every so many months and has even found a person to do this for bucks now why would someone allow for possibly making the horse lame and i swear by what i've seen of this horse that it is not a hock injury it is in the stifle and i don't know if she actually had this horse checked out by a licensed vet or not since she is having joe blow out there risk her horses well being anyway moving on no i do not fall into this category and i will retire a horse before i start paying to have it injected thank god i don't have any facing that people are constantly running there horses to chiropractors message therapists accupuncture etc etc and they never seem to do any better in that arena i swear its an excuse trying to take a short cut like already said and then when they screw up out there they have something to blame their mistakes on you watch them and you can see that it was obvious rider error but when they come out and tell you what happened it's oh my horse is too sore or something similar and my thought always is so why did you haul in the first place i am completely against all drugs and i am soo sick of ace i have heard well have you seen my horse run if i don't give it to him but the girl claims to be a big shot trainer in our area lol these girls go out behind the trailer and sneak a shot into the mouth of the horse or at larger events get up and use the bathroom at about am you'll find people sneaking around their stalls pearing out from around corners i have stopped and peared around myself thinking that i may be watching a horse theft in action and ready to stop it only to realise that they had a little bag of goodies they went into the stall with and then fed their horse and back off to bed they went if i need to supplement my horse with something i will do that but i do not fall prey to all those articles and advertising tactics out there all the endorsements and promises of this and that its all just hype if you ask me and everyone is so eager to win that and gain points for year end prizes that they will spend hundreds leading up to the little local event and when it doesn't happen they are back to the catalogs buying new bits and getting on the phone to their chiro's etc and telling them they need to get back in if they would spend more time riding and conditioning their horses they may just be amazed at what will happen and the money they could save i'm not saying there isn't a horse out there that has issues but today it seems like everyone is doing it and if that horse shoulders a barrel there's something wrong with the horse even though the rider has the horses nose tipped to the outside the whole distance to the next barrel whew i could go on and on this is definately something we agree on in and yes she should back her horse down to the essentials and not pump all that into the horse  Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Horse Friends Ben Johnson (athlete) Social rule Poker jargon Professional wrestling slang Tour de France Good Morning, Vietnam One Piece minor characters The Amazing Race Miss Saigon The Amber Spyglass Kill Bill Aerial (dance move) Humphrey Bogart About a Boy Toilet humour The Contender (television series) Craps Seabiscuit 1957 World Series True Crime: Streets of LA EastEnders Carburetor Blackjack Diving The Shining (film) The Inside Socrates The Ashlee Simpson Show Blood Simple Milton H.

what should i do if my horse rejects its foal my mare gave birth about a week ago poor thing in the heat but still yay she let it suckle for the first days but then the next couple of days she would allow it to feed we bottle fed it for days and it seems to be doing all right what is going on here why did she abandon the baby is there anything we should do all answers greatly appreciated there is no way to say why she rejected the baby the best thing for both you and the foal now is to get it onto a bucket and off the bottle you get mare's milk replacer and just train the foal to drink from the bucket if you have a black bucket it needs to hang from a white wall or a white bucket needs to hang from a darker wall fence etc they have trouble at that age making out shapes etc and this helps them recognize and find the bucket maiden mares can be a bit stupid and it might just mean that you hold the mare every couple of hours while the foal nurses or you can tie her short and hobble her however if she has truly rejected the baby quit the bottle and get her onto a bucket makes your life easier and the foal can feed as required in a few weeks as she gets bigger she will start bullying you and getting rough when she wants to feed and you are not going to have a bottle big enough to do it  Breastfeeding Bong Dairy RuneScape quests Baby bottle Infant Champagne (beverage) Milk Thoroughbred The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Max Martin Hamster Teat Gray (horse) Social rule Avvakum Elephant Comanche Kodocha Fiddler on the Roof Equine conformation Dog Trailer Park Boys Fire fighting Childbirth Plastic Sento Antenna (radio) Big Brother UK series 6 Shark The Super Milk-chan Show Rum Guinea pig Professional wrestling match types Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Yoghurt SpongeBob SquarePants Lucille Ball Tea Captain Thunderbolt Sea-Monkey Coffee About a Boy Young Earth creationism Domestication of the horse Paragliding Friends Premature birth Ayyavazhi religious practices Glossary of climbing terms Minnie Mouse The Catcher in the Rye Ben Johnson (athlete) The Family from One End Street The Human Stain EastEnders STS-86 Mosquito Makybe Diva Climbing equipment Livestock Black Sabbath The Apprentice 2 Philosophy of space and time Have I Got News For You Dick and Dom in da Bungalow Knots Landing Hash table C__ile Ferate Rom__ne Faith No More Hong Kong-style milk tea Infant formula Northerly Lammtarra Domestic goat Firefighter Radix sort Horse colic Bottle Poker jargon Capercaillie Romulus and Remus Scientology beliefs and practices The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Fancy rat Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Days of our Lives The Price Is Right Seabiscuit Soccer AM Final Fantasy: Unlimited Might and Power Arabian horse Dead Like Me Kimi Finster Kitchen Drill bit

equine uveitis have you or anyone you know ever had a horse with uveitis or moon blindness i had the vet come out the other day to see if my mare is pregnant or not thanks to a bunch of you rabid wolves who attack people when they ask questions and she diagnosed my mare with eru equine recurrent uveitis so my mare is like partially blind in her left eye and i was wondering if anyone has dealt with eru and how you dealt with it what you were able to do with the horse infected and what treatments works for your horses i need someone to talk to i am pretty devastated oh yeah mulereiner i am angry not for the folks who suggested i get her a vet to see if she could have complications but for those of you who told me i was unworthy of my horse because i had no idea if she was in foal or not oh and i only had the vet out to see her because she had an allergic reaction to penicillin i injected her because she has shipping flu called the vet out to take care of that and i did have a pregnancy test done because it was conveinient as of today her mammory vein is very prominent so i am pretty sure she is in foal i was to begin with but i will get the test back sometime this week thank you to the rest of you who answer my questions and actually help not send crappy spam my mare was years old and was totally blind due to uveitis it has been a long for me for the up to date treatment i can tell you that it took her over years to go blind in both eyes my mare rarely had pain and when she did i opted to bute her or give her banamine there seems to be a little controversary on which pain reliever better gets to the extremities both pain relievers did the job i liked the banamine because it's less hard on her stomach i did use several types of drops in her eyes and i was able to keep the uveitis as bay for many many years i will tell you that my mare did great with one eye blind and both blind i rode her when she was blind in one eye and she did find i put full blinders on her with one eye cut out for the good one i put those on for trail rides so she wouldn't injure the bad eye since she couldn't see the tree branches and such as soon as my mare went blind in the one eye i started to train her with voice commands and she did great when she did go competely blind we were prepared and that mare knew exactly what i was saying most people couldn't even tell that she was blind she would load lead still ride and knew her boundries so well even if i changed things around once she rolled and got caught in a fence and she stayed put with legs straight up in the air and perfectly still because i told her to i was able to take the boards out and cut the hot wire this was amazing proof to my hard work at training her by voice so worst case if it happens and it probably will not at least know that in my particular situation having a blind horse wasn't so bad i did take my mare to an equine teaching university with one of the top ten opthamologists in the country this was a long time ago so i am sure new techniques have developed at least i would hope so god bless and good luck wish i could have been more help edited keep a clean fly mask on her the blind eye is sensitive to insects sunlight and sunlight in the winter time too the eye will drain and you need to keep it clean i am sure you know this  Horse Equine conformation Piccolo Junior Saga Milton H.
