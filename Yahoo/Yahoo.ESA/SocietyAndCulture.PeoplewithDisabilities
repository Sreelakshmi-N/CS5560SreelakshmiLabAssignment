do disabled get hurt when people use words such as mong retard spaz spack ect btw i am not saying i use these words i am just wondering as people use them quite alot i would assume so i know in some cases when you're a close friend with someone it can be a joke between you my friend is totally blind and i call him blindy and he calls me eyes but i'd never let anyone else call him that it's because i know his comfort levels we've been friends our whole lives and he has a good attitude about his disability not everyone does i think people like to be known first and foremost as a person and not as a colour disability religion etc these words dehumanize and put the disability first that's mean  Mental retardation Learning disability Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 Cephalic disorder Evil Autism Deaf culture Political correctness Disability Social rule Homer Simpson Milton H.

why do so many people use the disabled parking spaces when they don't need to my dad can't walk far and the spaces are often full of able bodied people my friend has a disabled child who she has to cope with on her own don't these people care that it might be them or one of their family one day did point it out one day to the 'trolley men' who used to tell people misusing them but they don't bother any more i also phoned the store manager asda who promised he would tell the men but nothing changed why can't they put a sticker on their cars asking them not to park there in future just to show them up i wouldn't assume people weren't disabled just because they didn't have a outward sign of disability but lot's of times it so obvious some people might use one and look quite abled but aren't people with early ms can look normal but get tired easily and need to use them so you can't always assume that these people are able bodied those that are abled though are just selfish i have a disabled mum who uses a wheel chair and a lot of the time all the disabled places are taken and we have to wait until one becomes available as she needs the extra space to get into her wheel chair some people just don't realise the inconvenience they are causing to disabled people and their friends and families when they take these spaces i hope my comment makes them think twice in future  Social rule About a Boy Shopping cart Time Out of Mind 2000 Australian Grand Prix Milton H.

retard what do i do people i know and meet always call disabled people retarded etc and have no respect and think its so funny and my brothers mentally disabled not so much just mild autism but i never mention it to anymore because of their attitudes towards disabled people what do i do luna i'm a little confused by you you say that people you know always call disabled people retarded have no respect think it's so funny if you know that this is wrong and you have an autistic brother why do you hang around with them you say that you never mention your brother his autism anymore because of their attitudes towards disabled people so what do you do laugh along with them i don't know how old you are i can understand you want friends but shouldn't your brother come first your brother is not retarded he has autism which is a developmental disability i worked with autistic children for some years before i became physically disabled from illness autistic children can often be of higher intelligence than healthy people you ask what can you do first you can stop being ashamed of your brother i don't know how old your brother is or how easy it is for him to be around people he does not know or large groups of people if he is old enough why don't you take your brother out with you sometimes it may be good for him it will certainly be good for you to get used to being with a disabled person in public this may help you learn how to deal with ignorant people your brother is not going away and neither is his autism although he may improve greatly you need to accept him with pride for who he is why don't you say something to these people when they start with their comments about retarded people tell them to grow up already that they're not funny get angry tell them you're sick of hearing that crap if these people do not stop i think it's time for you to find new friends when i was in school there were a few jerks like that and they thought they were the funniest people around i knew they were jerks so i didn't hang around with them it can't be possible that everyone you meet is like this tell yourself you are better than they are don't sink to their low level have pride in yourself in your brother find friends you can be proud of too good luck  Autism rights movement Controversies in autism Asperger syndrome Mental retardation Autistic culture Mental illness Rain Man Political correctness Ethical challenges to autism treatment Neurodiversity Autism epidemic Learning disability Autistic savant Autistic community Autistic spectrum Stuttering Gifted Shaggy dog story Social rule Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Intelligence quotient Facilitated communication Disability Cephalic disorder Piccolo Junior Saga Shit AFI 100 Years series Alcoholics Anonymous Eugenics Pervasive developmental disorder Homer Simpson Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Theory of mind Hypoglycemia Bernard Rimland Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders Friends Aspies For Freedom Milton H.

my twin sister my twin sister and i were four months premie i was developed all the way but she does not have a right arm and most of the time can't walk and has to use a wheelchair when we are in public people stare at her and i can't stand it anymore what should i do amanda i do know how you feel because i go out in a motorized wheelchair with a brace on my neck and an oxygen tank just as you walk beside your sister my husband walks beside me some ignorant people stare so hard that they actually turn around to stare as i go past them this is the first year i don't notice it much but it used to make me furious i guess i finally reached the point where those types don't bother me any more but i know you can't just tell yourself not to let it bother you you feel what you feel for some years when i couldn't stand it i had to do something i did different things on different days depending upon my mood sometimes i'd be serious other times i'd be silly for my age when i was feeling serious i would say something like didn't your mother ever teach you it's rude to stare at people or haven't you ever seen a wheelchair before or i would ask them if they needed eye drops more often i'd be silly but the point still got across i would ask some people if they would like my autograph too i would say i know i'm prettier than you but don't be jealous sometimes my husband would put his head next to mine we'd both say cheese as if getting our picture taken there were other things too depending on the day i'm usually a very friendly happy person but the rudeness of some of these adults drove me nuts i guess it was hard enough trying to accept that i was in the wheelchair that these people pushed me beyond tolerance for some years normally i am a dignified woman with class but that's how angry they made me it never bothered me when children stared they are naturally curious haven't yet been taught not to stare some little ones would ask me what my wheelchair was others would ask their parents why i was in one i was pleased to hear that almost of the parents gave a good answer what really made me furious was when total strangers would walk up to me and say things like what's wrong with you with a straight face i would say do you know me they would look a bit surprised say no then i'd say i didn't think so then they got the point would apologize i guess it took me a few years to get it out of my system but now i barely notice it it makes my husband angrier now maybe because i'm not reacting to them except for the people who take my picture they actually do that on a fairly regular basis anyway i'm glad you your sister have each other there are different ways you can handle it try not to be bothered if little children stare because they don't know any better also try to be understanding if elderly people stare or say certain things within reason i knew that to them it was a shock to see someone as young as i am in a wheelchair for the most part they are feeling compassion don't realize they may be speaking out of place i just usually smile back politely and i would guess that you your sister are a lot younger than i am however everyone between little children elderly people most certainly should know it's rude to stare and just because they may not see people in wheelchairs that often doesn't excuse their rude behavior i know that i live in a big city and not a day passes that i don't see at least one or more persons who use wheelchairs what about talking to your sister to see how she feels and have you told her how it makes you feel that might help you two might come up with some ideas as to how to handle the people who stare maybe eventually you will stop noticing it so much but be patient with yourself i know some people tell you not to let it bother you but you can't force yourself to feel a certain way it is a process that you will go through where the end result will hopefully be that it won't bother you but you're not at that point yet and that's ok the best of luck to you your sister  Milton H.

what about the caregiver partner i married a quadriplegic because i loved him he married me because i was young strong able to take care of him i didn't get that for a long time if he had ever really loved me we would still be married but he lied to me i divorced him so i could find the love i deserved despite the fact that i wasn't the one who lied i was considered the bad guy because i was what was then called able bodied i left him i was wrong our other disabled friends wouldn't talk to me bigotry doesn't have to be related to color to be wrong why doesn't the caregiver have the same rights to love happiness respect debbie i am so impressed with you most women wouldn't have had the nerve to leave a loveless marriage where you were totally manipulated they would be too wracked with guilt worried about what other people will think so they would stay trapped forever you made the brave choice to move on in spite of what you are going through now the caregiver most certainly has the same rights to love happiness respect you're right about bigotry too and don't forget double standards i'm married and some years ago i became disabled due to illness at first i was on crutches then i was in a motorized wheelchair for the past years i have been bedridden and for the last my husband has been my caregiver we love each other but do you know what people say to him why do you stay with her why don't you leave her so if a man is a caregiver then everyone is understanding if he deserts her i belong to a site with others who have my illness and i know several women whose husbands took off rather than take care of their wives you were right and brave to leave your husband who lied to you didn't love you and my husband is right to stay with me in a relationship where we both love each other and everybody else should just mind their own business keep their mouths shut if my husband tells someone he loves me would never leave me then that person should be glad for him if you tell someone how you were deceived decided to leave that person should be glad for you you should probably still go to a caregivers support group because you are obviously still dealing with issues my husband went to a support group once for a while but it wasn't the right one for him isn't it amazing how full of opinions people are when they know nothing about your personal situation someone once said something to me that i found to be very insightful he said it doesn't matter if i convince them that i'm right it's enough that i know i'm right you know you're right debbie it may mean you lose a few friends and that is sad but you will make new friends move on have your own life probably meet someone who will love you for who you are i am one disabled person who respects you for what you did it's not easy taking care of someone i made sure i read all my husband's books on caregiving i wanted to understand his side of the equation now that i've gotten much sicker people are starting to make comments if he goes out for a hour break critical comments to me about his leaving me alone i will not let them criticize him i tell them what is what my husband's health physical and emotional are just as important as mine we have grown closer through our situation and look after each other do for each other in whatever ways we can and we won't let other people's ideas opinions remarks get to us we support each other we each have people to support us separately you deserve the support you need for what you have lived through for how you were treated in your marriage and now by people who were supposed to be friends i hope you find the comfort support respect you deserve the best of luck to you  Theory of conduct Pitaten EastEnders Friends Transsexuality One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Polygamy Divorce Kodocha Social rule Days of our Lives Marriage Shaggy dog story Simone Weil Fathers' rights Phoebe Halliwell Laura Schlessinger Jon Secada Milton H.

from what you know of persons with mental or emotional disabilities it could be you a relative or a friend would the person be interested in participating in a cooperative volunteer arrangement in which they put in hours of service in something they do well such as reading aloud or child care or mowing lawns in exchange for another person offering them a service like cooking meals for them several times a week or tutoring in a difficult subject or driving them to doctor's appointments how well do you think this idea would be received if a person with a mental or emotional disability is given the opportunity to work in a field of a particular expertise they have they should be paid accordingly studies being done have shown that if a person can participate in the community as a normal person for want of a better term they do better especially if paid fairly for a fair days work i think you mean well by what your asking but bartering a person with a mental or emotional disability out in exchange for other services could have some serious problems as people by shear nature will use and abuse this system leaving the already vulnerable person at risk of further abuse for this to work you would have to have police screening of participants including the very people your trying to assist have written contracts between participants to prevent abuse misuse conduct assessments of the venue where the person is working etc this includes oh s you would need to have some sort of policies procedures and feed back forms to continue to improve and met each participants needs and wants i would suggest you do check with local authorities about legislation relating to volunteers services so you do not breach any laws please be mindful that people with mental or emotional disabilities are still people who are quite capable of thinking for themselves even if at times a little cloudy  Contract Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mental Health Act 1983 Social work Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act LiveJournal Schizophrenia Education in the United States Involuntary commitment Traumatic brain injury Unemployment Scientology beliefs and practices Publicly funded medicine Abortion Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Health care in the United States National Institutes of Health Copyright Abortion in the United States Ethics Learning disability Mental illness Insurance Intellectual property Corporate governance Stroke Eugenics Down syndrome Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hypoglycemia Surveillance Stanford prison experiment Health insurance Asperger syndrome Public domain Adult attention-deficit disorder Clinical depression Autism Infantilism Mind Education in the People's Republic of China Community emergency response team Social justice Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Independent agencies of the United States government Supply and demand Prostate cancer Social rule Offer and acceptance Drug addiction Scientific method Nurse Borderline personality disorder Goodness and value theory Grief Dyslexia Stuttering GED Polyamory Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland Terri Schiavo Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Employment in Hong Kong Civil rights Combat stress reaction Addiction Domination & submission (BDSM) Transsexuality Psychology Public-key cryptography Ludwig Wittgenstein Alcoholism Childlove movement Apprenticeship Gun politics Deprogramming Mediation Democracy Homeschooling Unlawful combatant Law Pedophilia Breastfeeding Hypnosis Fathers' rights Administrative law of the United States No Child Left Behind Act Hillary Rodham Clinton Internet troll

how does crabby blindguy read the questions hows he see well i'm probably the best person to answer that i use a special software program called zoomtext though that's one of several good ones on the market it does two things one is to enable me to magnify and configure the screen display i do have a bit of residual vision s o this helps but it also reads whatever is on the screen for example i have it configured so that it echos reads out in audio each keystroke as i'm typing this so i know what i'm typing when i want to read something i just put the cursor on the line and the text is read out so i can hear it then arrow down to read the next line and so on some people use a scroll setting so they don't have to use the arrow key though i usually don't addedendum to belladonna nightshade you aren't ranting well okay you are but you are right the concept you talk about is called universal design making our social world more accessible for everyone and it usually makes things better for those who don't have disabilities as welll by making things more convenient automatic doors for example combined with assistive technology what i use it also makes it possible for people with disabilities to participate in society including education and employment and that benefits the non disabled as well because then people with disabilties can be self supporting in most cases rather than being subsidized by the government  Windows 2000 Mouse (computing) Emacs Windows XP Amstrad CPC Atari 8-bit family Assistive technology WordStar AmigaOS Screenshot Text editor Computer accessibility Portable Document Format Theory of conduct System/36 Control character Floppy disk Modem Windows Vista Apple typography IBM PC compatible DVD Sinclair ZX81 Web accessibility Copy protection Spyware Blindness IBM PC keyboard Enterprise content management Microeconomics Perl System/34 Bluetooth Redundant array of independent disks NX bit Original Amiga chipset PlayStation 3 PHP WordPerfect Xbox 360 Hearing impairment Current teachings of Prem Rawat ZX Spectrum OpenDocument Copyright Fritz-chip Pretty Good Privacy Closed captioning IBM X Window System Screen reader CPU cache Control Panel (Windows) Cyberspace Java programming language Learning disability Computer and video game genres Database Disability Objective-C Ebook Blue screen of death ITunes Unemployment Software testing Television Beatmania IIDX Anarchism and society Expert system Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Pump It Up Apple II family Word processor Typewriter Password Musical Instrument Digital Interface Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Criticism of libertarianism AS/400 Command Language Oscilloscope Keyboard layout GED Inheritance (computer science) Web page CPU design Consensus decision-making Mac OS X USB flash drive Requirements analysis Microsoft Windows Commodore 128 MapleStory Virtual memory Atari ST Elevator TRS-80

dont you find it interesting how so many people posting here assume that being disabled also means being mentally and intellectually disabled and or in a wheelchair to quote lilykdesign canada has very strict discrimination laws employers walk a fine line when they deal with anyone who seems a little different i find that highly offensive disabled people are something employers have to deal with and all disabled people even those with invisible physical disabilites seem a little different no one ever assumes i am disabled in fact most people dont believe me that has been the biggest stumbling block to getting my disability pension and any assistance this kind of bigoted crap just burns my butt disabled people all look funny act funny are different stand out in the crowd as not normal and of course no one ever discriminates against them because we have laws these kinds of assumptions are behind discrimination in hiring if i tell an employer i am disabled then are they doing assume i am a little different and wont fit in with their other employees and they will have to deal with this fictional difference what does a little different mean anyhow odd strange behavior looks weird talks funny doesnt understand things the way normal people do or does it mean this person is intelligent capable a hard worker she will be an excellent part time employer so she needs a chair with a good back support no problem in an ideal world it would and it should but it seldom does there are different kinds of discrimination there is the stigma of difference there is the lack of understanding that some things come with more difficulty than for others you may have a disability that when accommodated you almost seem as if you are not disabled but that does not mean you are not disabled sometimes it seems like you have to fake being more disabled than you are because people fail to understand your real level of disability without the visible reminders of it this is partly why an invisible disability is in many ways the most difficult to deal with  Disability Unemployment Mental retardation Insurance Autism rights movement Asperger syndrome Learning disability Affirmative action Autism Microeconomics Mental illness Dyslexia Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Labor theory of value Stuttering Social Security (United States) Discrimination Supernatural Volleyball Infantilism Civil rights Franz Boas Atheism Normal distribution Contract Divorce Neurodiversity Law of value Recurring South Park characters Pedophilia Political correctness Martial art Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Chronic fatigue syndrome Abortion in the United States Psychology A Course In Miracles Labour economics Noam Chomsky Same-sex marriage Controversies in autism Combine (Half-Life 2) Ontological argument Intelligent design Atomic Kitten Dilbert Cyberspace GED Invisibility Employment discrimination Shit Power (sociology) Capitalism Sexual orientation Pension The nature of God in Western theology Human sexual behavior Gay rights Capital accumulation Mediation Stairway Stupidity Equal Protection Clause Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Hearing impairment Poverty Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Science Philosophy of space and time Redundant array of independent disks Economic inequality Combat stress reaction Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism RuneScape quests Coercion Social rule Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms Sant Thakar Singh Disability Discrimination Act 1995 Jennifer Lopez Victor Cousin American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Information warfare Down syndrome Animal rights Cephalic disorder Gender role Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Disability etiquette W.

some ideas about new sports in the paralympic games what do you think of this if we truly want to promote ability rather than disability then may be we should add more categories to different sports in the paralympic games such as electric wheelchair synchronised swimming electric wheelchair spring board diving wheelchair ski jump winter paralympic games blind ski jump winter paralympic games wheelchair steeple chase wheelchair hurdles blind or vitually impaired skeet shooting wheelchair madisons like incycling the one you give your team mate a push thanks to jobees for this suggestion i posted this in the sport olympics section of yahoo answers and the majority of people haven't got a clue of what i was talking about regarding disability issues i mean i am posting it in this section for people who understand disabilities issue what do you think starwhitedwarf ski ing for people in wheelchairs is possible there are midified skis that are made for people who use a wheelchair you sit in the ski and you also have two ski poles crabby blindguy it seems that the humour that was meant in this question has been lost i mean electric wheelchair synchronised swimming come on visualise it and see how absurd that is don't take it so seriously it was just some silly and funny ideas thrown around by a bunch of kids who have muscular dystrophy several years ago i thought if they can laugh at themselves and see the funny side of disability then we ordinary people should also be able to do the same i like it  2004 Summer Paralympics Paralympic Games Skiing Volleyball 2004 Summer Olympics Great Britain at the 2004 Summer Olympics Wheelchair rugby Sport Canada at the 2004 Summer Olympics Sports timeline I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Poland at the 2004 Summer Olympics Cross-country skiing Olympic medalists in athletics (men) Wheelchair basketball 1992 Winter Olympics Disability Commonwealth Games Little Britain Wheelchair Olympic Flame London 2012 Olympic bid 2000 Summer Olympics China at the 2004 Summer Olympics Russia at the 2004 Summer Olympics Tennis Muscular Dystrophy Association Hungary at the 2004 Summer Olympics Sport rowing Milton H.

do you ever feel like 'damaged goods' a year ago i became permanently disabiled and it has hindered me from working or ever having a relationship again whenever i start feeling i have no purpose anymore i tell myself i have to create new purposes for myself now but to reflect on how i once was and how i am now always makes me feel a little down how do you get past these blues you will go through a grieving process its only natural because you have suffered a loss after a year you should be recovering from the grief over your loss its the same as grieving the death of someone because you did lose someone yourself after my accident i would sit at the table looking out my window and think i will never climb another mountain i will never get up on a beautiful morning like this and go running again i will never go skiing again everyone has a job and i dont etc i felt very isolated very lonely very alone and forgotten i felt as if i would spend the rest of my life looking out the window watching people with lives while i had none i was a type a personality before my accident my husband walked out on me and the kids i didnt go out with anyone for years but during that time i was reinventing myself coming to grips with who i was now finding my way in a new world you will always have memories of the things you did and part of you will always feel a little sad always think i wish i could go running but thats okay too as long as your focus doesnt become what you cant do and not what you can do you have to learn to acknowledge yah that was good its sad i cant do that anymore but i have good memories memories are for looking back on and thinking it was a good time they arent supposed to be where we live our day to day lives i still feel sad when i think of my fiance who was killed i wish he was still alive but thats the past i focus on the memories of the good times together not on the fact that he isnt here anymore because thats life some of us suffer losses they hurt we treasure the memories thank god we did have the change to do the things we did love the people who came into our lives and we file them back into our memory box and look at what we can do today i had my kids and they kept me busy all the time one thing i could do was be an asst coach for minor baseball my son's team that was my recreation for those years i had to force myself to get out and do things swimming i went horse back riding on a very slow old horse i couldnt handle the high powered fiesty ones anymore because of my upper body injury my son would say mom you cant climb anymore but lets go hiking you go as far as you can and we will go ahead for a little ways sit down here wait for us here is your water your sun screen see you in about minutes my hiking was is about five minutes of walking and i have to sit down but i can feel the peace of being there appreciate the beauty of nature i am out where i used to be and want to be you learn to appreciate small steps i could say whats the point but just being out and part of their lives and breathing the fresh air is better than sitting at home doing nothing it feels good sometimes i cry because i cant go on and climb even a hill but its still worth it after awhile you stop crying i remember one day he brought a friend out to the house who had a motorcycle and announced i was going for a ride he told his friend to get it up to about kph on the highway it was fun i couldnt handle a bike because of my disability but it was fun for me you do what you can of what you used to do and you learn its better than nothing and after awhile you start to enjoy life on a smaller scale you learn to seize the day carpe diem i was on the island saw a tall ship and decided right there i was going sailing on it you learn not to think about it do it another time i was never an impulsive person before my accident but that day i talked to the guy who had the ship plunked down and went sailing for four hours it was amazing after my accident i lost all but three of my friends the rest just faded away because i couldnt do things with them anymore so i know how hard it is you dont say what your disability is or how severe it is maybe god shut the door maybe he only opened the window a tiny crack but you have to think of things you can do and you have to make yourself do them dont rush into a relationship this time is for you and about you you need to get to know the new you and come to grips with that learn to like the new person you are who you are is inside you in your heart all the other things were stuff you did but the real you is still there and you have to find that person love that person and find ways to get that person out into the world again the really important thing is dont let yourself get so down that you start to make bad choices and allow people to take advantage of you because you arent caring for yourself and loving yourself make a plan for the next day to get yourself out and or doing something it takes more planning but you can do it you have to do it you can drown in self pity and grief or you can swim with the current and become a survivor you wont be the same person but you are still a person ask yourself today what do you need what do you want and make it happen for you carpe diem  Shaggy dog story The Amber Spyglass Jon Secada Scenes from a Memory About

what if we made all parking lots handicapped accessible i mean able bodied people can use elevators and ramps so why not make all parking spaces big enough for wheelchairs walkers etc there are two types of accessible parking space spaces that are wider and have an access aisle next to them for lift access and wider spaces that are just designated for people with disabilities the problem is that parking lots are all very different and they had to find a rule that fits all best some people need parking that is closer and some people need parking that is wider and some people need both if you made all parking wider it would be fewer parking spaces and less income for the nearby business or for the city collecting parking fees what makes most sense is to make one aisle accessible with the farthest spots in the aisle wider people with power chairs don't need to be closer but they do need to be safe and if there was a specicif aisle with chairs people would know to be mre cautious driving in that aisle but that wouldn't work in tiny parking lots or strip malls and there would be people who use chairs that woud complain no solution please all  Stairway Shopping mall Disability rights movement Elevator Parking Wheelchair Urban sprawl Hong Kong International Airport Passenger car Disability Accessibility Pacific, Missouri Hard disk Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Trailer Park Boys Bike lane debate United States House of Representatives New Urbanism Skateboarding trick Revco Street Combine (Half-Life 2) Redundant array of independent disks Don Mills (TTC) Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Universal design School bus Wayne Corporation RISC Train station Rosa Parks Mall of America Rest area Computer Professional wrestling throws Stave church Suburbs of Johannesburg Equine conformation Railroad car Space elevator Chinglish Docklands Light Railway Aberdeen Ocean's Twelve Extreme Programming Ontological argument Wood carving Sport utility vehicle Disneyland Skiing Sento Crane (machine) Bicycle helmet Golf Tennis Star Destroyer Sears Holdings Corporation Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Autorack Long Path Recurring South Park characters Cathedral architecture Whistler-Blackcomb Paragliding Yosemite National Park Milton H.
