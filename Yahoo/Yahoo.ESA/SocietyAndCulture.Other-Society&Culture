why do so many americans own guns a survey i saw said of all americans have guns this makes me wonder why do we have all these guns in a modern and industrialized country we have to right to bear arms wither for the militia or for some service but i think what the founding fathers had in mind at the time was that back then america was sparsely populated not including indians most people were farmers and it was a wild place for over years america's history the country was considered a frontier farms all throughout the land wild animals wild people the need to hunt to survive prompted people to buy guns gangs do it for buisness so they need guns but now we have supermarkets and the land isnt wild anymore its not like someone will come into your house and rape and steal so why do so many people have guns its useless only gangsters use guns for their intended purpose at least once since canada is big but not as populated do a lot of canadians own guns if there not as many people owned guns there wouldnt be so many gun related accidents where little kids go around pretending to be tough when sum who thinks they are for real shoots and neutralizes the threat to society or they shoot sum else or themselves on accident lousy id driven parents woah do you live in the real world or in some fantasy its not like someone will come into your house and rape and steal i beg your pardon do you have any clue how many home invasions we do have in the usa yeah i have a gun i have more than one i want to be able to defend myself and fyi where i live the land is sort of wild not every one lives in a city or a suburb  Sin City American Old West Murder War of 1812 Anti-aircraft warfare Pulp Fiction Gun politics New France Biff Tannen EastEnders Billy the Kid Escape from New York Jam (TV series) Miss Saigon Bonnie and Clyde Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Trailer Park Boys Firearm Military history of Canada Sioux Uprising Beavis and Butt-head Saratoga Campaign Kodocha History of Canada American Revolutionary War Theory of conduct Video game controversy The Invisibles Goldfinger Knots Landing Gun politics in the United States Red River Rebellion Bowling for Columbine Tenshinhan Poker jargon Inuit It's Walky!

is there such a thing as too much free speech this is in regards to the phelps clan protesting at funnerals and memorials of soldires and those who died in the bridge collapse do you think this group stretches the freedom of speech to or even past its limits no i dont believe free speech has a limit we should tolerate it even if its annoying to us freedom of speech can sometimes wind up in a paradox where it contradicts itself like they have a right to be heard but we are all equal so we have the right not to hear something that can be stretched real far will always have paradoxes god and the problem of evil for instance in times like these we have to decide what to do for example if they are protesting or suing for the money because they have been hurt in someway that we can choose to ignore their plea if they are protesting but they are not in it for the money but something much less trivial like they donated it all or something then they should be heard the idea of too much freedom of speech may transcend human understanding but i believe there are people who can understand  Paradox Free will Religious pluralism School of Salamanca Simone Weil Reinhold Niebuhr Theodicy First Amendment to the United States Constitution Predestination Democracy Ten Commandments Goodness and value theory Hate speech Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) God G__del's incompleteness theorem Alcoholics Anonymous Theory of conduct Religious Society of Friends Sheikh Abdullah Separation of church and state Problem of evil Scientology beliefs and practices Philosophy of language Immortality Epistemology Existence of God Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Jewish principles of faith Omnipotence Immanuel Kant Civil rights Evil Original sin Axiom of choice Atheism Socrates Jewish views of religious pluralism Infinity Microeconomics Stoicism The nature of God in Western theology Religious conversion Open Theism Referendum Quantum mechanics Freedom of religion Supernatural Victor Cousin Sexual orientation Sinfest Biblical inerrancy Mantra Monty Hall problem Public policy Naive set theory Determinism Human nature Creationism Intelligent design Criticism of libertarianism Social progress Status of religious freedom in France Transactional analysis Jiddu Krishnamurti Christian-Jewish reconciliation Deconstruction Syllabus of Errors Corporate personhood S__ren Kierkegaard Pitaten EPR paradox Freedom of the press Philosophy of mathematics Prisoner's dilemma Wealth Unitarian Universalism Gorgias Opus Dei Coercion Transcendental argument for the existence of God Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Stanley Brehaut Ryerson Autism rights movement Presuppositional apologetics Restorationism Time travel Falun Gong Gettysburg Address Protestantism American Civil Liberties Union Jehovah's Witnesses Thomas Carlyle Dissociative identity disorder Truth French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Libertarian socialism

should more restrictions be placed on welfare recipients welfare has existed for many years however it has not been so widely used as it is today my mother recieved welfare for three months while in between jobs however there are many who not only live on welfare but conceive and give birth multiple times while on welfare i see nothing wrong with giving someone a hand up when they are having trouble i do have a problem with giving a hand out to people who simply abuse a system created to help those in need especialy when it is at taxpayers expence what if any restrictions should be placed on welfare what would be the long term and short term impact not only economicaly but socialy as well if harsher restrictions were implimented would it increase or decrease crime and would it overflow the job market with unskilled labor also those whom recieve an education through welfare should they be made to pay back the cost of said education very interested to see the responces i think the only way to really deal with this would be to put some kind of time limit or child restriction on it i really don't think people should be allowed to have children as in become pregnant and give birth while they're on welfare birth control no matter what the cost is not as expensive as having a child and people totally take advantage of the system by having another child as soon as their checks are about to stop coming in i don't know what it would do about crime i don't even understand crime my mindset is completely different will education lead to less crime studies have proven this but it's a matter of parents that aren't having children to get a welfare check and having children that they can love nurture educate correctly not about how to mooch the system and actually want for a reason other than the money that they'll get for the next few years basically it's infuriating that as a college student that only makes enough money to cover my tuition per year is taken out of my check for taxes i'm sure a huge portion of which is going to people that make the choice not to work  Unemployment Education in the People's Republic of China Economics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Microeconomics Inflation Publicly funded medicine Education in the United States Health insurance Flat tax Abortion debate Tuition Credit card Welfare Supply and demand FairTax Tax Arguments for and against drug prohibition Medicare (Canada) Domestic violence Education in England Social welfare Education in Germany Theory of conduct Poker jargon Education Public policy Child support Psychiatric hospital Economic inequality Life insurance Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Democracy Moral Politics Public domain Divorce Marriage Privatization Bretton Woods system Free trade Centrelink Mach kernel Freeters Blackjack Labour economics Graduate school Liberalism Welfare reform Academia Intelligence quotient Slot machine Capitalism Abortion Ghetto Annuity United Kingdom corporation tax Economy of the United States Keynesian economics Progressive tax Tariff GED Debugging Insurance Price discrimination Simone Weil Wal-Mart Adoption New Deal Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Childbirth American Conservatism Social Security (United States) Betting (poker) School choice Carburetor Redundant array of independent disks Separation of church and state Israeli Arab Unemployment benefit Humphrey Bogart Taxation in the United States Trade union Hillary Rodham Clinton American individualist anarchism Property (ownership right) Criticism of libertarianism Subsidy Wealth Model (economics)

were you a goody two shoes as a teenager because presently i am a teenager and a goody two shoes i do nothing bad and i'm fine with that it's a very unstressful life but everybody seems to act like they had a wild adolescence so i'm thinking there's gotta be other folks out there who had a mundane high school experience right i was very much a goody two shoes there is nothing wrong with that and i applaud you for your attitude if you are going to have a wild side trust me when i say that it is far better to have that wild side when you are out of high school and much older than while you are in your teens and 's people who go through their wild side while they are younger often make poor judgments that have very negative repercussions on their lives due to their lack of maturity as we get older and we become more mature then when we feel like letting loose and being wild we have more maturity usually not always to handle things better and will be more daring or uninhibited in certain areas but will exercise more common sense and judgment as we are doing these things i used to be such a goody two shoes and never gave my parents anything to worry about as a teenager i'm in my 's now and love to do things i never did when i was younger nothing bad i assure you but definately not the goody two shoes type of behavior i once had all moral stuff i promise you i am too old to be stupid about my behavior and yet i have more fun now than i did years ago all without the negative repercussions i could have had if i had been more wild while i was younger  Child sexuality Infantilism Evil Ethics Human sexual behavior Goodness and value theory Sexual orientation Adolescence Sexual abstinence Pedophilia Abortion debate One Tree Hill (TV series) Stuttering Alignment (role-playing games) Theory of conduct Laura Schlessinger Statutory rape Sex education Buffy the Vampire Slayer Happiness Patriotism Rocko's Modern Life Ten Commandments Religion Bon Jovi Summa Theologiae Borderline personality disorder The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Nicomachean Ethics The Catcher in the Rye Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Human Theodicy Anorexia nervosa Age of consent David Hume The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Peter Singer Garfield Procrastination Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Narcissism Immanuel Kant Scientology beliefs and practices Justification (theology) Avenue Q Homosexuality Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Wolfrider Video game controversy Arthur Schopenhauer Cultural relativism Philip J.

what do people enjoy about smoking i'm sure the reason that people smoke is because cigarettes are addictive but for people who first start smoking why there has to be some reason something people enjoy about it i always here about the health effects of smoking but isn't their something that gives people a good feeling when they smoke i mean it can't just be the taste because then people could just eat something and if they taste anything like they smell that can't be what gets people to start what is it that's enjoyable about a cigarette some people start smoking because of the social aspect of it because i know that's why a lot of my friends did i also know people who took it up because it was an excuse to have a break and go outside while at work the good feeling may stem from the fact that tobacco is a stimulant just like coffee etc and a lot of people start having those when they are tired or to be social and eventually can not go without them so i think it could be the same for cigarettes  Tobacco smoking Cigarette Cigar Cigarette Smoking Man Cocaine Cannabis (drug) Mojave people Hookah Tobacco Arguments for and against drug prohibition Drug addiction Smoking pipe Tobacco advertising The Smoking Room Goodness and value theory Hypnosis Health issues and the effects of cannabis Snus Word of Wisdom Coffee Drug abuse Methamphetamine Medical cannabis Microeconomics Tobacco industry Friends Tea Sauna Bong Social rule Breastfeeding Nicotine Consensual crime Billboard (advertising) Yerba mate Illegal drug trade Traumatic incident reduction About a Boy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder The Usual Suspects Addiction Fruits Basket Coffee and Cigarettes Starbucks Prohibition (drugs) Kretek Banana Spliff Anger management Common cold E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt) Trailer Park Boys Health insurance Extreme Programming Fred Flintstone Oral sex Luther Leonidas Terry Smoking fetishism Kitchen Traumatic brain injury Opium Cancer Chocolate People's Republic of China Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Schizophrenia Cheese Daredevil Human sexual behavior Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Prostate cancer National Institutes of Health Theory of conduct Masturbation Hydrogen cyanide Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Red Hot Chili Peppers Ron Weasley Gauloise George Costanza Meditation Cuisine of Denmark Beavis and Butt-head Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Caffeine Phencyclidine Breakfast Harm reduction Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Wall Street Food Mid-levels Drinking culture Sento Public relations Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 2000 Australian Grand Prix Richard Doll Hashish

how many of you are pro choice and feel that its a women's right to choose i believe it is a woman's right to choose because their is no reasonable way to stop them this may sound draconian so please let me explain abortion may be amoral but i do not believe that it should be illegal making abortion illegal does not stop abortions from being performed it just makes them more dangerous and more difficult to get if one is poor i believe that if a person wants to prevent abortions that person should work toward solving the issues which lead to unwanted pregnancies unprotected sex lack of sex education etc it is proven that the more education a person receives the more opportunities which become open to them the fewer children they have many tout adoption as a reasonable alternative to abortion i feel this argument is disingenuous to the reality of the state of foster care in america and the very real danger and expense of bringing a child to term most children adopted by americans are adopted from other countries very few american children who get put up for adoption ever get adopted orphanages are inadequately funded and probably understaffed or mismanaged most of the children growing up there will suffer from severe emotional and psychological problems it costs about to have a baby in a hospital in america today if the person having that baby cannot pay they become either indebted or the hospital state will defray the cost to everyone else through taxes and higher medical costs finally lets not forget that giving birth while natural can be very dangerous even if the baby is healthy the mother may suffer from lasting physical effects some of you may feel these women should suffer the consequences of their actions but don't forget that the child and the rest of society must suffer those consequences as well until more people in this country show a willingness and interest in adopting american born children until that problem is solved i don't believe we can reasonably suggest that adoption is a perfect alternative let's stop getting hung up on whether or not the practice is right or wrong and lets work together to reach a solution even the people who want the option of having an abortion don't actually ever want to get one  Abortion debate Adoption Abortion in the United States Abortion Breastfeeding Divorce Transsexuality Infantilism Roe v.

why do some people attack a person's bad spelling when they raise a good point a question raising a good point was asked by some guy and or posters decided to attack that person's spelling instead of answering the question why do some people do this ksoileau i agree with you if someone brags abut being know it all or attacks someone's spelling first then they deserve to have it done back at them because they don't have a real answer to a question it might also inflate their ego making themselves feel better and thus superior to that person ultimately people do this when a person's views on a topic are implied in a question if the poster doesn't agree with the implied positions and the poster doesn't have a rational rebuttal then the person attacks the only things they can rationally if i write 'tha sky iz blu' or 'i am wite' it makes no difference how i spelt the words the fact of the matter is that the sky will remain blue and i will remain white regardless of how i wrote the words the truth of a statement is not contingent upon the personality education position in life etc of the person saying it but upon whether or not their statements reflect a truth in the world no amount of arguing against a person's grammar or personality can change that  Theory of conduct Goodness and value theory Meaning of life Ethics Theodicy Philosophical skepticism The nature of God in Western theology English grammar Atheism Abortion debate A Course In Miracles Truth Philosophy of language Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Trinity Rei Ayanami God Biblical inerrancy Existence of God Moral relativism Plame affair Microeconomics Friedrich Schleiermacher Modal logic David Hume Deconstruction Simone Weil Inflation Dualism (philosophy of mind) Transactional analysis Philosophy of mathematics Free will Presuppositional apologetics Objectivist philosophy Yusuf al-Qaradawi Utilitarianism Fahrenheit 9/11 Meaning Past teachings of Prem Rawat Lie Infant baptism Reality Ontological argument Agnosticism Labor theory of value Acts of the Apostles Supply and demand Falsifiability Morality Jacob Neusner Bernard Williams Nicomachean Ethics Fallacy Summa Theologiae Maimonides Aesthetic Realism Donald Davidson (philosopher) Human Victor Cousin Intelligent design movement Originalism Evil Japanese grammar Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Final Fantasy magic Hiberno-English Logic Justification (theology) Keynesian economics G__del's incompleteness theorem Teach the Controversy Soul Economics Intelligent design Estoppel Social rule Avenue Q Immanuel Kant Predestination Creationism Strong atheism Lincoln-Douglas Debate Vacuous truth Altruism National Kidney Foundation Singapore Criticism of libertarianism Determinism Esperanto grammar Philosophy of science Philosophical Investigations Scientology beliefs and practices Merit Charles Darwin's views on religion Sola fide Propaganda Bill Maher Logical argument

does it ever make you wonder what's real when god only seems to answer about one prayer in a thousand does it make you feel better when someone says god didn't want you to have the other things because they weren't good for you or when they say god knows best or when they say god works in mysterious ways yes makes a person wonder what makes people think they will be answered by god as it is really they who are saying it not god also the buisness of god working in mysterious ways is contradictory as god created the earth and did nothing after that nothing mysterious just nothing was done by god after that the worshippers of god did the rest bred various animals killed said god wanted them to strange thing is there is a question not asked enough times it is this ''so you believe in god well how do you know god believes in you'' god could say ''i do not believe that anyone worships me there is no such thing as humans so i cannot answer their prayers'' could god be an athiest there is a book title by the name why god is an athiest i cannot get out of my mind i know i have read it somewhere but cannot recall one of the reasons god could be an athiest could be that god is disgusted with humanity so chose to not believe in god as it belief in god is just an excuse to do what people want speaking of one of the things a person could get from god there is the marriage something always seemed odd about it it seems like asking your parent if you can have sex with your wife as well as another man if that is okay as well then to ask the partner if this is what is desired is even more bizzare because obviously the partner does but is permission is not given by the creator who would not have created people without that in mind and another man or person gives their permission any child can be deemed illegitimit as if people can pretend it was not their own child aperson has to ask what do these people think they are doing treating a person with scorn because they do not ask another person if they can have sex is she accepts money she is bad but if she goes into a building and asks another man if she can have sex with the man she is with for the rest of her life then she is good then a person could ask if the woman goes into a church asks the priest for temporary marriege a separation to follow after the man she is with has made use of her services course things changed now but a person has to wonder if god is laughing up in heaven no it does not but seems down on earth some very bizzare things occur  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Eastern Orthodox Church Justification (theology) Ten Commandments God Origin belief Sexual orientation Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity The nature of God in Western theology Roman Catholic Church Evolutionary creationism Human sexual behavior Marriage Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Reincarnation Infantilism Idolatry Theory of conduct Socrates Scientology beliefs and practices A Course In Miracles Creationism Religion Predestination Prayer Supernatural Mojave people Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Judaism Free will Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Theodicy Discworld gods Simone Weil Immanuel Kant Church of Christ, Scientist God Emperor of Dune Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Mary, the mother of Jesus Catechism Separation of church and state God and gender Rich Mullins Christian eschatology Genesis Trinity Meaning of life Abortion debate Qiyamah Phaedo Human Summa Theologiae Merit Sant Thakar Singh Spiritism Jews as a chosen people Korban Existence of God One Tree Hill (TV series) Adam-God theory Goodness and value theory Apostles' Creed Eucharist Nation of Islam Community of Christ The Catcher in the Rye Christian view of marriage Pharisees Voodoo Infant baptism Smartism Amidah Baptism Exorcism Sabbath Christianity Alan Campbell (pastor) John Wycliffe Angel Same-sex marriage Soul Shakers Creation according to Genesis Separation of church and state in the United States Prophet Salvation Muhammad Duties of the Heart Women in Islam Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Satan Evil Homosexuality and Christianity

do you agree w asking an employee of yours to wear long sleeves because she has several scars on her arms the scars are mine and they are from a period in my life when i had no better ways to solve my problems then to cut myself it was years ago when i did most of them the scars will most likely stay the way they are unless i get surgery i work at cvs and my employer has asked me to wear long sleeves because he doesn't like how they look at my last job it was the same way only i worked with kids and i understand is it okay for my boss to ask me to do this it's very hot in the store sometimes and i do alot of lifting wear i tend to get very hot what do you think when you see a person with scars on there arms note i am different then someone who is trying to flaunt it the scares are simply something i've come to terms with and try neither to hide it or flaunt it they are just there i am years old when i get an education i wont have to worry bout this anymore but i was just wondering what other's opionions are the reason i am asking is because i don't think it is lawfully correct of him to ask me it is very hot in ny and it makes me uncomfortable i have ms and don't like getting very hot i feel like i'm going to faint i also feel that people should accept me the way i am i am very nice to people at one point i wasn't very nice to myself obviously but why is it there business does it scare people cutting is becoming more of a serious issue the general public should become aware of it anyway it is illegal for your boss to request that you wear long sleeves unless all employees are required to wear long sleeves it is discriminatory for him to talk to you about the scars on your arms these although self inflicted are the same as a scar from surgery or an assualt first i would let your boss know that you are uncomfortable wearing long sleeves due to the weather second i would contact the cvs employee help line you can do this anonymously and report the incident to them i have scars as well not on my face or arms and would be very offended if someone told me to cover the  Sin City Surveillance Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Social rule Theory of conduct Avenue Q Plame affair The Shining (film) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Traumatic incident reduction Prostate cancer Self-harm The Ashlee Simpson Show Combine (Half-Life 2) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Scar StarCraft: Uprising Milton H.

do you know the colors of the wind thanks in advance for all the great answers i want to sit back and enjoy reading your comments wind is of air and air is mainly nitrogen with of course oxygen at least it is on this planet and gives off a characteristic green color this explains the characteristic green hue of the aurora however there are other gases present also and when you take these into account and factor in altitude as well it is common for the entire spectrum to be visible what a beautiful world it is that we live in but putting science aside and closing my eyes i see wind as green water as blue earth as brown red black and fire as orange red yellow the quest for truth as white and ignorance as black which in the case of racism is rather ironic  Color Color theory Rainbow Black body Decompression sickness Oxygen Mars Sun Gamut Diamond color Hydrogen Biogeochemical cycle Nuclear explosion Cloud Power Rangers Planetary nebula Light-emitting diode Solar system Color temperature Solar variation Earth's atmosphere Primary color Material properties of diamond Opportunity rover Optical spectrum CIE 1931 color space Lighting Eye color Color blindness The Covenant Terraforming Snooker Iris (anatomy) Chemoluminescence Rayleigh scattering Garnet Yoshi Ultraviolet Unidentified flying object Laser Vacuum John Dalton Color space Pysanka Nitrogen Fluorescent lamp Diamond enhancement Georges-Pierre Seurat Flame Explosive material Cascading Style Sheets Plasma (physics) Planet Gaia theory (science) Carbon dioxide Ozone depletion Traffic light James McNeill Whistler Blue Diamond simulant Rainbow Brite Flood geology Melanin Huygens probe Lunar Prospector Colours, standards and guidons The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Mario series enemies Wassily Kandinsky Political colour Taikyoku shogi Discoveries of the chemical elements Comet Crayola Pikmin Aes Sedai Lightning Phosphorus Green Lantern Vehicle registration plate Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite Wallpaper group Ozone hole Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Colors of noise Color metaphors for race Advance Wars Renewable energy Neptune Purple Pixel Meteorology Dragons (Pern) Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water Dune Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9

why is it that universities have to have a certain amount of minorities wouldn't it be less racist if ethnicity was removed from the applications honestly i am a white female and it is the worst demographic not male anymore and i am a little worried about getting many scholarships i know i still have time i am only however i think it is ridiculous that there are so many scholarships available for only minorities i am not racist but i can help but feel that it is unfair that i have to work so much harder for a scholarship for example friend is a minority and she got the bill gates scholarship and it pays for everything new laptops room and board everything my other friend national merit and she also got a full ride to a state school however her scholarship is not paying for everything and she still needs to come up with a lot of money i have nothing against her fiend i mean good for her but seriously how does that get rid of prejudice absolutely agree one of the ways to keep racism is to emphasize it i would better have scholarships for those who work hard and have good grades or give a chance to someone who want to improve their level of education and after that the harder you work less you pay in some countries you have to pay for your studies only if you have under notes maybe that would be good guide  Affirmative action Racism Graduate school Education in the United States National Certificate of Educational Achievement Theory of conduct Scholarship Education in Romania SAT Student loan Numerus clausus Tariff School choice Education in Germany New Zealand Scholarship College admissions Education in Portugal Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in Japan Education in the People's Republic of China Poker jargon Grade (education) Boston Public Bumiputra Education Nadir of American race relations Black (people) Unemployment Race and intelligence Students' union Final Fantasy XI Scientific racism Arab-Israeli conflict University of Maryland Baltimore County Education in New Zealand Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Korean adoptee Androgen insensitivity syndrome Commonwealth of Nations Asian fetish Deflation (economics) Infantilism Internet fraud GED University of Michigan Fair use Pioneer Fund Bob Rae Bond Anti-Defamation League Zionism and racism IBM PC compatible African American contemporary issues Model minority Intelligent design movement Capitalism No Child Left Behind Act Westminster School Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle Council of Conservative Citizens Franklin W.

taking photos at a funeral just recently i've seen a lot of people close to the person that's passed of course taking photos of the person casket flowers etc i think it's a bit strange but memorable at the same time why do people do this it's actually quite common as some other people have said people grieve in different ways each to his own as a funeral director i get requests to take photos of the deceased for the benefit of family members who are out of town or unavailable at the time of the funeral as a rule we make it a practice of asking the next of kin or the family member in charge first before we take photographs our funeral home serves a large portion of the asian community locally asians are the ones who most often take pictures or video tape the funeral literally every funeral you can bet there is a camera there they will even try and video tape the funeral procession if there is one that is until the traffic escorts prohibit them from doing it for safety reasons why do people do it i don't know as i said people grieve in different ways i try not to judge i respect that everyone in this world is unique  Funeral Cremation Funeral home Burial Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan Embalming 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Death and state funeral of Pierre Trudeau Current teachings of Prem Rawat Military funeral State funeral of John F.

hi ok so i just have to point out i definately am not racist i just need some advice answers okay here's the deal my mom is single and she's been single for quite a while she's dated and had guy friends and all but recently she got a new job and she started talking to this man it turns out that he has a daughter thats the same age as my little sister so with that said she started taking my sister to the park to have play dates with that man and his daughter well this man is black and my mom is hispanic i know hispanics are horribly close minded even people in my family are this way the other day she was telling me that a few people were already spreading rumors about her and i was telling her well as long as she knows they are just friends but now shes telling me that in the future they might be more than friends i don't know what to do about the people that will talk about her or the people that aren't going to accept them both hispanic and black i am so glad for her because he makes her very happy but what should i do we are in and we still have people that are incredibly ignorant i need help dealing with them hi sweetie i understand you worrying over your mom and i agree people are going to talk about her and her black man it's awesome that you feel so protective about her and her whereabouts however you can't control what other think do or believe i live in an extremely narrow minded country italy where if your fiance happens to be a non italian non european person friends just abandon you in the same country i get scolded and judged for asking to get food without olive oil even when i explain that i have a rare hereditary disorder that prevents me from absorbing fats and if i eat any it's like gulping bottles of phospho fleet finally again in the same country getting medical help for mental illness is considered like being a looser who will never do something with his or her life there isn't much i can do aside from refusing to take any sh t i sure wish they were better persons but i realise that they like to play the bully not just because they know nothing better but because they refuse to grow out of cultural prejudices support your mom her friend and their desire and possibility to get another chance just because one has gotten divorced or widowed once that doesn't mean s he has to be alone and without a whole family together tight hugs to you and your little sister as well  Kodocha Friends Theory of conduct Transsexuality Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Charmed The Smoking Room Pitaten Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Little Britain Vernon Schillinger The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe EastEnders Phoebe Halliwell Recurring South Park characters Sexual orientation The Fairly OddParents Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Humphrey Bogart The Catcher in the Rye Pok__mon Live!

good excuses i need some ideas for excuses for missing football practice on saturday i really need something that won't be questioned and that i can tell my coach ahead of time when missing something like football practice school work etc there is one method that works really good say something outrageous like my mother is stuck in a well it's gonna take a team of oxen to pull her out i have to go help i'll be back tuesday then stick with your story it's too funny for them to really bring the hammer down people understand you have to miss things from time to time and sometimes it's a private matter they usually won't ask what your really doing more than once or twice  Bowl Championship Series Cincinnati Bengals Crystal Palace F.C.

ok so wouldn't it be a good idea to have a smoking ban in all public places so that those of us who don't smoke don't have to come in contact with other people's second hand smoke it's harming us too yep but it would really piss off the chavvy addicts who sit outside caf s and pubs indulging in their noxious habit i think they would rebel if they could only smoke at home but it would be better for everyone else i can see it coming in the next few years hopefully  Smoking ban Tobacco smoking Cigarette Tobacco Euphemism Coffeehouse Arguments for and against drug prohibition Hand grenade Consensual crime Treehouse of Horror IX Cigarette Smoking Man Mojave people Public house Paternalism Snus Theory of conduct Kurt Cobain Humphrey Bogart Liam Gallagher Health insurance Legal drinking age Drug abuse Fire fighting Smoking fetishism Cigar Breakfast Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Anger management Kitchen Bong Cocaine Methamphetamine Edward VIII of the United Kingdom Calvin and Hobbes Reefer Madness The Clash Illegal drug trade Eric Cartman Lung cancer Smoking cessation Noob Smoke Narcotic Externality Fitz Hugh Ludlow Criticism of libertarianism Sex Pistols Smoking pipe Addiction Milton H.

should the terminally ill be required to tell relatives of coming death if they tell them the family can start acting weird but also might appreciate them more if they don't tell them they can save some of the emotional people from grieving and can see how people truly act around them what is your view in most cases if the ill person is told by a doctor of their terminal illness you can assume that the doctor has already told the relatives or an appropriate party of the medical problem it is then up to the the relatives or appropriate party ies to decide whether or not to inform the patient of their medical problem the medical industry has skirted the patients right to know by enacting laws that make it legal to not tell miss inform the patient in minnesota the statue number for this law is which was mandated by the minnesota department of health this allows the doctors and or providers to give the patient no information miss information or out right lies and still charge big bucks the statue states that this law takes away the rights of patients but as in the case of aids it helps to protect the person who gave the patient aids but this is only partially true and is not the stimulus for the statute common sense tells you that they should be protecting the masses not an individual that alone should hint that there is a hidden reason for this law this type of law is only in a handful of states different states may have different laws concerning patients rights the real reason reason behind this law reads like a mystery novel but let me assure you it is true check it out if you have questions email me  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Medical record Abortion in the United States Mental Health Act 1983 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Medicine Involuntary commitment Euthanasia Abortion debate Publicly funded medicine Divorce Medicare (Canada) Plame affair Contract Theory of conduct Insurance Hearsay Health insurance Ethics Partial-birth abortion Lawrence v.

what is the most positive way to handle a disagreement the most important thing is to stay calm and not try to make a disagreement into a competition most disagreements will not have a resolution at least one person might have to yield it doesn't mean that you lost just that you think peace is more important than pride and the feeling of power you get when you escalate a conflict sometimes depending on the person you just have to let it go and try not to bring it up again if its possible if it is something like politics  Aikido Nonviolence Act of Parliament John Howard Yoder UN Security Council Resolution 242 Foreign policy of Japan Theory of conduct Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Karen Horney Irish neutrality The Left and Opposition to War Conflict Value system Philosophical skepticism Competition Oslo Accords Lebanese Civil War Ethics Consensus decision-making International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict Old Swiss Confederacy Narcissism Mediation Northern Ireland Assembly Atheism Political status of Taiwan Democracy Six-Day War Enneagram Zionism 2004 Republican National Convention Lie Democratic peace theory Current teachings of Prem Rawat Decolonization Liberalism Iraq disarmament crisis International conventions on terrorism Economic inequality Sino-Soviet split Angular resolution Ulic Qel-Droma Neville Chamberlain Cyprus dispute International Criminal Court Nicomachean Ethics Autism rights movement Narrator Social rule Appeasement Technocratic movement North West Company Vietnam War Dog training Origins of the American Civil War Conflict resolution State Lincoln-Douglas Debate Melvin R.

what comes more naturally to you trying to plan your life setting objectives looking for viable alternatives to your goals and how to achieve them or just living each day as it comes and blaming circumstances and other people for your failures a mixture of the two except that i try not to blame anything or anyone for my failures including myself i endeavour not to see failure but instead to see the flow of events and new opportunities that usually works for me i always have some vision of what i'd like my future to be like an idea of how to work toward it and i do work toward it but using feedback that means that as i go along my journey i watch out for how i feel how my wishes change the new things i meet on the way and ideas for new strategies for achieving my wishes and i modify my path and my goals accordingly the whole thing is dynamic changing evolving as i walk my path at the same time i like to live moment to moment playing pondering and enjoying i need both  Strategic management Strategic planning Goodness and value theory Leadership Intelligent design Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Extreme Programming Happiness Consensus decision-making Meaning of life Star Trek Customizable Card Game Rational Unified Process Narcissism New Age Engineering Algorithm Milton H.

why are so many people in favor of abortions while browsing some questions online i came across a few about young girls wanting to have an abortions those who pleded with her not to have one and who said it was wrong to kill an innocent life which i agree with had many thumbs down why are so many ppl in favor now a days of killing an unborn child the only way i see having an abortion acceptable is in a rape incest case i know ima get alot of smart sses answering this but it really bothers me why is it ok so easy for people to kill now days just for your delightful information first off i'm not worried about if a women gets an abortion or not what i wanted to know is why is it so acceptable now days for ppl to make such a decision so easily i myself and pro choice meaning if a women wants to get one she can after all she is the one who will have to live with it the rest of her life and answer to her creator whom ever she may believe that to be i would never get one because i am more responsible to prevent it and if there was a instance where i was to become pregnant then i knew the risk before having sex i have a cousin who has had abortions she uses them like birth control and have an aunt who had one when she was in her s now in her late s and nearly every night after drinking she sits and cries wishing she had never had an abortion when she was younger i was only trying to understand the mentally of some of the ppl who think it is alright to do such a thing got it got it because they are completely oblivious to what actually happens to the the baby they are young and stupid and think that a quick roll in the hay is completely safe girls are easily tricked by a cute guy as the guy just wants to get his rocks off and add another notch to the headboard most if not all the cases the girl hardly ever talks to the guy anymore and when it is all said and done the guy is usually out of the picture girls need to be taught what happens and the consequences of having an unborn child ripped piece by piece from inside her but guys are not without fault either they need to realize that having sex is not all that important to life scoring a with a different girl every other weekend or seeing how many you can lay before the end of highschool is ludacris and rediculous guys going around saying they slept with this girl and that girl does not make you more of a man cuz if all those girls get pregnant and you going to be the man to take care of the kid or the mother times that lil boy doesnt even have a job to support himself and still lives at home if you really need to get off boys you were given two hands incase gets tired and girls grow up he doesnt love you if he wants to get in you pants on the st date and if you let him do that then by all means you deserve all the guilt ridicule shame and consequences it brings with it teaching safe sex will not teach you about abortion girls and boys need to be shown exactly what happens when a baby is torn from inside a woman they need to know what they are doing and what they will have to live with for the rest of their lives they need to know that they have other options besides abortion  Abortion debate EastEnders Jon Secada Abortion Abortion in the United States Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) Sin City Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Days of our Lives Married... with Children Rape Birth control Roe v.

why is poverty and crime associated with blacks when the poorest state in the nation is west virginia and it's a very white state i live in ohio and thought about living in huntington wv because i like rural country areas and thought there would be less crime down there than in oh but huntington is so old and run down the crime rate is higher than you'd think for a smalltown area and it's over white btw charleston the capital is the most diverse area in the state and it's still over white i've heard the drug problem there is very bad the whole state is pretty shoddy it makes ohio look like a nice place to live i just want to know why people associate crime and poverty with minorities so much when look at places like wv i associate crime w a low socioeconomic status too i lived in a large city and i ended up getting robbed i was in a pretty nice area but it was close to some declining ones actually all of that city was bad because even the nice suburban areas were close to poorer areas everything was so packed in and congested i'm from a small town the people that robbed me were a group of kids comprised of both black and whites the city was almost black white and the crime breakdown pretty much falls that way too look at what is on the news all the time i'm in columbus ohio you rarely see the news broadcast the white guy that got shot by his buddy but you do see the black guy who gunned down his ex girlfriend because of an argument just examples so i'd blame the press the newspaper i do have to say tho i lived in the hood for a while a year back i was the only white girl in the neighborhood i constantly saw drug deals gun shots hookers walking around but dont get me wrong every neighborhood has it's problems the black people do it and the white people do it blue people do it too it's all about how society profiles people just keep an open mind and just say no to drugs had to throw that in there  Urban sprawl Urban planning Harlem Washington, D.C.

is it true that brad pitt is opening a sperm bank is it ethical legal i heard on television and even saw on the net that brad pitt is selling his sperm to a select group of women there was actually a poll done on the world's most beautiful man and majority of people from all the continents agreed that he is the most beautiful i heard that he said that there are women that want beautiful babies so of course they'd go for him well i don't have that much money but i too would like to have his sperm and have his child i know with his sperm that i'll have a gorgeous little boy or girl i want his sperm p s my friends and i are in highschool and we're saving up money to have his sperm my suggestion is for you and your friends to continue saving your money and invest it in your future education even if this rumor were true who is going to support financially the child brad hahahahaha he may have a lot of money but certainly he is not going to spend it on raising a string of test tube babies with half of his dna you will be the one supporting and raising the child and that you can do better with a better education no matter who the father of your child may be a child is not a toy it is a human being it deserves to be raised by a set of loving caring parents who can afford to give the child care comfort food shelter clothing and an education of it's own just ask your parents how much work a child is if you want to have brad pitt's baby then start a business making brad pitt baby dolls and sell them you'd be better off brad would be better off and you would spare a whole bunch of pitt babies an upbringing they don't deserve go to school let brad worry about brad and you worry about your future not a brad baby  EastEnders Abortion debate In vitro fertilisation Friends William Pitt the Younger Angelina Jolie Transsexuality Jon Secada Adoption Infantilism Hillary Rodham Clinton Father Britney Spears Breastfeeding Charles Lee Ray Kodocha Comanche Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Little Britain Romulus and Remus Bradley Nowell Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Economic inequality My Life as a Teenage Robot Simone Weil For Better or For Worse The Drifters The Incredibles Rais massacre The Amber Spyglass Microcredit Married... with Children Destiny's Child Parenting Fathers' rights Sharon Tate Personal finance Sunset Beach (soap opera) Polyamory Infertility Abortion in the United States Avenue Q Justification (theology) Capital accumulation Alois Hitler Whale Terri Schiavo Artificial insemination Theory of conduct One Life to Live Sears Holdings Corporation Doll Bank AFI 100 Years series The Beach Boys Empire Burlesque Sexual intercourse Charmed U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 John Money 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Descendants of Darkness Hilary Duff Eugenics Autism rights movement Frankie Laine Jeopardy!

eye for an eye tooth for a tooth when i returned back to work after a hospital operation my work collegue who is also a friend who i sometimes go for drinks with didn't even ask me how i was i was away for a week and still to this day she hasn't even ask me anything about it even though we sit nex to each other at work i was quite upset now some time later she too has returned from a stay in hospital after an operation but i still cant forget the time she completley ingnored me and showed a lack of interest into my wellbeing i am feeling like doing the same ignoring the fact she's been away just to give her a tase of her own medicine should i i have been in exactly the same situation in my case i was rushed off to hospital at high speed in the back of an ambulance i spent four weeks in there and for the first ten days i was hanging on to life by a thread within minutes of me returning home my neighbour who is also a friend and fully aware that i have pulmonary fibrosis a progressive and incurable condition came round to say she'd been frantic with worry not relating to my health at all but because she couldn't get into my place to help herself to the contents of my fridge and fruitbowl to save it being wasted before i could even speak she asked me to give her a spare set of keys to my home because she knew i'd been shopping the day before and that my fridge would be full up i told her not to worry as my mum has a set of keys and always takes anything perishable from my fridge whenever i'm in hospital for more than a few days at my request so nothing goes to waste i couldn't believe that this person who calls herself a good friend of mine could be so callous and while i deplore the idea of any food being wasted given the number of starving people in the world i still find it incredible that she could value a few pieces of fruit and a couple of pints of milk at a higher price than my life it was a real shock to discover just how selfish and inconsiderate she really is this all happened about three months ago since which she has been in hospital to have a baby poor thing the baby not her when she got home i went round to see the baby and her asked if she was alright and if there was anything she wanted or needed she wasted no time at all sending me off on various shopping sprees regardless of how ill i happened to be at the time and i stupidly perhaps obliged but i can say i have derived a certain degree of satisfaction from not allowing myself to be reduced to her level even though she did only go into hospital to have a baby it's not as if she was ill or has been since so my advice to you would be to show a certain amount of concern for her following her operation and don't bring yourself down to her level believe me it won't make you feel good if you behave just like her and you never know it might even trigger a pang of conscience in her although i wouldn't hold your breath by the way although i don't know you i do know there isn't a surgical operation that could be described as a remotely pleasant experience so i for one hope that you're fighting fit again and wish you all the best for the future take care michael  Theory of conduct Breastfeeding About a Boy Jon Secada Kodocha Knots Landing Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Altruism The Contender (television series) Shaggy dog story Childbirth Infantilism One Tree Hill (TV series) God Emperor of Dune Humphrey Bogart IBM PC compatible Pitaten Scientology beliefs and practices CPU cache Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Piccolo Junior Saga Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Mach kernel The Emancipation of Mimi The Amber Spyglass Neighbours Milton H.

why does it get harder to develop meaningful and caring friendships in today's world it just seems that everyone has become wary and distrustful of people around them i have just moved to a new country that is considered very cosmoplitan and open but everyone i meet and speak to who also have been living there over a period of time talk about how difficult it is to develop new relationships despite there being people from over major nationalities living in this country one ends up meeting with only one's own kind and socialise with the chosen few whom one feels 'safe' with i find that globalisation hasnt freed the human mind just made it more unaccepting any thoughts i think it's a manifestation of communication via the media we're more aware of deteriorating morals and the prevalence of scams and crimes via personal communication idd sms and email we've retained our social network without relying on new encounters it's safer to retain the known albeit distant relationship than risk a new encounter i think i recognize the country you speak of as i've seen the same characteristic over the years the condition you describe is especially apparent in some of the fast growing mncs currently increasing their local presence  Autism Globalization Human sexual behavior Surveillance Infantilism RuneScape cheats Obsessive-compulsive disorder Hearing impairment Cybersex Publicly funded medicine Breastfeeding BDSM T'Pol Sexual orientation Schizophrenia Adoption The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Homophobia The Brothers Karamazov Psychoanalysis Social rule AIDS Sigmund Freud A Course In Miracles Transactional analysis Consensus decision-making Autism rights movement Child sexual abuse Poverty Friendship LiveJournal Prostate cancer Postmodernism Zoophilia Organic farming Love Polyamory Nicomachean Ethics Computer virus Narcissism Internet fraud Asperger syndrome Simone Weil Pedophilia Marriage Child sexuality Computer-supported collaboration Quebec sovereignty movement Realism in international relations Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Black (people) Freedom of speech Short message service Gender role Evil Carl Jung Empathy Neville Chamberlain Advertising Magical thinking Bipolar disorder Fast bowling Human Causality Sociocultural evolution Crime prevention through environmental design Public domain Religious pluralism Hyperinflation Karen Horney Addiction Social psychology Animism Enlargement of the European Union Free trade Patriotism Traumatic brain injury World government Humanist Movement Subud Altruism Bondage (BDSM) Mobile phone Abortion Health insurance Rabies Suicide Anonymity Narrative Lie Identity theft Science Paragliding Objectivist philosophy Jewish views of religious pluralism Internet Blog Brave New World Prayer

why does american televison suck so bad i've been watching some shows online from other countries like britain france switzerland etc and i realize they have better writing greater ideas and aren't focused so much on reality tv so why is it that these countries have great tv and america with so many companies and budgets can't produce anything but crap maybe because here in america we put any and everything on tv that shouldn't really be there i guess in other countries they have a good intentions for tv and it's mainly to educate their audience and entertain them in a positive way here in america the main purpose is to entertain and you can see that because many of us don't pay attention to the important stuff  Theory of conduct Craps Advertising Paul W.

when you was what time was you allowed back home after a day out answerrr sorry i meant when you were people on here are really quick to judge when people make mistakes but think about this im currently doing gcse's im expected to get a's and why are you going on about a curfew i have never got involved with the police most of my time i am at home studying or out with my friends and i stay out of trouble i posted this question out of pure curiousity and i would like to say dont judge a book by its cover and the people that made them comments to apologise i imagine that it depends on the child i was allowed out until whatever time i chose but i was always in the house before pm this was mainly out of respect for my parents because they had to work early now i did good in school and i was a very well behaved child that my parents trusted i have three brothers that skipped school stole money from my parents destroyed things and so on they were not allowed to go anywhere they also had to be in bed at a certain time and i did not i wouldn't push the issues with your parents because you are still a child parents do not make rules just to make rules if you had a job your parents might be a bit more lenient my point is your parents have to trust you once you honestly have your parents trust you'd be surprised by how much more authority over your own life that they give you  Theory of conduct Social rule Polyamory 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Plame affair Blankets (graphic novel) Justification (theology) No Child Left Behind Act Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Alignment (role-playing games) Scouting Social Security (United States) The nature of God in Western theology Poker jargon Article One of the United States Constitution Social psychology James Bulger Kender The Catcher in the Rye Education in Germany Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Carl Barks Prince Edmund (Blackadder) EastEnders Eddie Guerrero W.I.T.C.H.

why do we kill people who kill people to show people that killing people is wrong referring to the death penalty kind of hypocritical isn't it please keep person attacks comments out of this there's no room for immaturity thanks to everyone i oppose it because it does not prevent or reduce crime and it risks executing innocent people although this is a highly emotional issue for many people i think it needs to be discussed with the facts here are answers to questions about the practical aspects of the death penalty system with sources listed below what about the risk of executing innocent people people on death rows have been released with evidence of their innocence doesn't dna keep new cases like these from happening dna is available in less than of all homicides it is not a guarantee against the execution of innocent people doesn't the death penalty prevent others from committing murder no reputable study shows the death penalty to be a deterrent to be a deterrent a punishment must be sure and swift the death penalty is neither homicide rates are higher in states and regions that have it than in states that do not so what are the alternatives life without parole is now on the books in states it means what it says it is sure and swift and rarely appealed life without parole is less expensive than the death penalty but isn't the death penalty cheaper than keeping criminals in prison the death penalty costs much more than life in prison mostly because of the legal process anytime the death penalty is a possible sentence extra costs start to mount up even before a trial continuing through the uniquely complicated trial actually separate stages mandated by the supreme court in death penalty cases and subsequent appeals what about the very worst crimes the death penalty isn t reserved for the worst of the worst but rather for defendants with the worst lawyers when is the last time a wealthy person was sentenced to death let alone executed doesn't the death penalty help families of murder victims not necessarily murder victim family members across the country argue that the drawn out death penalty process is painful for them and that life without parole is an appropriate alternative so why don't we speed up the process over of the innocent people released from death row had already served over a decade if the process is speeded up we are sure to execute an innocent person  Miscarriage of justice Life imprisonment Roper v.

i feel lost in life dunno where to go or what to do please give me some advice serious advice thanks in advance hm im and feel like my life will be wasted not knowing what i want to do i think pronouncing the guy depressed at this stage is a little premature i remember feeling the same way at twenty one in fact throughout my early twenties you're taught to believe you should have it worked out by now you should have qualifications and one foot on the path to where you want to be in the future i'm not convinced that's how it works for most people there's always going to be some people you know who are certain what they want and are single minded about getting it don't let that make you feel inadequate imagine all the opportunities you miss if you are single minded you need to decide what's important to you try not to think too much about 'the future' or 'wasting your life' the future is uncertain and forgive me if this sounds patronising at you're probably judging 'wasting your life' by other people's standards by what's expected of you so what do you want money experience knowledge relationships what do you value most i'd be wary of chasing money at this point money is transient it comes and goes all the other things are permanent they're your life and you get to keep them so i would define a wasted life as one solely focused on career and financial gain unless that's what you love doing who do you admire and why that's admire not envy careful with that one the simple answer is to try everything that appeals to you no matter how off the wall or what anybody else thinks sounds cheesy but follow your heart go travelling read some books meet some people volunteer create something get a job if you want one the only way you can really waste your life is if you don't do what you want to but if nothing appeals to you and you're having trouble with the basics i e getting out of bed in the morning then you may benefit from talking to your doc either way you'll be fine just stop everything for a while and put some serious time into thinking about yourself and what you want the answers will come  Theory of conduct A Course In Miracles W.

whats the difference between racism and bullying i experienced some racial things since moving to a place where whites are minority basically comments and one person got a little out of control i am not a racist so it was a surprise to me to experience that backlash of anger esp since i dont think i deserve it anyway this caused me to read about hate crimes in general i was wondering what the difference is between racism and plain bullying if there was no one of a different race i wonder if haters would find something else or someone else to pick on i was also wondering do you think the problem of racism will ever be solved i think its quite frightening thanks racisim is a prejudice about someone based upon their race and nothing else it does not have to be physical in any way and may be quite subtle actually but it is there it all comes down to race though bullying happens for any reason or no reason at all this includes race it can also be subtle and not physical if race didn't exist people would find other reasons to pick on people like the colour of their hair eyes etc as hateful people will always find hate when they look for it i hope that racism is solved but i think we are a long way off that maybe it will happen when even numbers of races live in all areas so no one is a majority or minority and people have personal experience with all races  Racism Black (people) Hate group Ethnic issues in Japan Social rule White (people) Homophobia Supernatural Human Scientific racism Theory of conduct Hate speech Race of Jesus Hate Kender Transactional analysis Anger management Hate crime Nadir of American race relations Street fighting Affirmative action Boston Public Anti-Zionism Christian Identity Racism in the United States Color Afrocentrism Southern Poverty Law Center Pioneer Fund Rei Ayanami Avenue Q British National Party Anti-Defamation League Alexander Technique American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Melanin Racialism Zionism and racism Asperger syndrome Media and ethnicity Dilbert Sant Thakar Singh Franz Boas Domestic violence Schizophrenia Racial segregation Race Arab-Israeli conflict White supremacy Islamophobia White separatism Albert Einstein Equal Protection Clause Race and intelligence (Public controversy) Out-of-body experience Race and intelligence Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Nation of Islam Human sexual behavior Red hair DNA Economic inequality Pitaten Prejudice Nigger Slobodan Milo__evi__ Anti-Semitism Theodicy String theory Southern United States Richard Littlejohn Vernon Schillinger History of South Africa in the apartheid era W.I.T.C.H.

should we avoid buing products from countries where child labour is an issue there are those who believe that our purchases keep children in chains and those who say that poverty creates child labor and by improving the income of impoverished households we help reduce the workload of children what do you think the short answer is no if you did boycott then two things would happen the children would have nothing at all and in most cases this money although what we in the west call slave labour is in most cases in line with the cost of living in these countries and their families depend on this income to live as the job market is limited and there is no social security as in britain to sustain them the already fragile economies of these countries would collapse as their would be even less foreign income into the country if we go down the route some people are calling for ie paying a realistic price for these goods you would find again what would happen these increased prices we would theoretically pay would not be passed on to the workers involved and if you think about it the respective governments could and would not allow this to happen because contrary to what a lot of people think their economy is mainly based on internal issues and if a certain minority altough a significant minority suddenly began receiving western style salaries then the internal economy would disintegrate a lot of essential internal items would overnight be subject to price hikes and the governments couldn't stop it and they certainly couldn't increase local salaries to counterbalance if you think of it in terms of britain the average salary in britain is ponds per year and the cost of living is roughly the same if you take essential costs the average salary in a lot of third world countries dollars per month and the average cost of living is roughly the same so what would happen if a significant minority suddenly started getting western style salaries and the majority are still on local salaries think about it because as much as we criticise it's less than years ago britain was also using child labour to keep a few priveliged people in comfort and it was only though internal struggle via unions and a few politicians who came from working class backgrounds that things improved here over in most underdeveloped countries there are no free and impartial elections it is more likely a dictatorial style of government similar to the ones we had when child labour was being used here ie only the rich were in power and if you were working class you had no chance of getting in parliament alittle bit like today but at least you have an oportunity to try  Gross domestic product Free trade Minimum wage Microeconomics Economic inequality Capitalism Trade union Anarchism and capitalism Progressive tax Labor theory of value Great Depression Capital accumulation Inflation Privatization Political economy Labor-power Labour economics Surplus value Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economy of Pakistan Publicly funded medicine Productive and unproductive labour Economy of Africa Health insurance Democracy Trade Unemployment Compensation of employees Tariff Commodity Flat tax Arbitrage Economy of India Canadian and American economies compared Deflation (economics) Article One of the United States Constitution 1973 oil crisis Wal-Mart Soviet Union Economy of Russia Mutual fund Supply and demand Monetary policy Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Graduate school Balassa-Samuelson effect Eight hour day Gold standard Libertarian socialism Euroscepticism Surplus labour Economy of the United States New Deal Fair trade Taxation in the United States Hyperinflation Industrial Revolution History of the United States (1918-1945) Principal-agent problem Contract Euro Asian financial crisis Economy of Belgium Globalization Economy of El Salvador Wealth Ethical consumerism Elections in the United Kingdom Zambia Economy of Norway Canadian House of Commons Sweatshop Economy of Chile Primitive accumulation of capital Australian Labor Party Insurance Offshoring Social Security (United States) Education in the People's Republic of China Arturo Frondizi Economic history of Japan Tuition Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Famine Karl Marx U.S. public debt Ford Motor Company

bit of a rant lately i have tried to give some informed answers and ask some questions however i have found some folk on here seem to decry me for bad grammer or spelling rather than answer the question asked if you have a look at my profile besides other serious ailments i had a stroke wich sometimes interfers with my spelling ability and they always say use spellcheck but in my state it is still a matter of sometimes making a choice do these people have nothing to do than nitpick or is this discrimination against the disabled one thought comes to mind there but for the grace of god go i thanks for reading this and i look forward to reading your answers pax well frank my stepmother had a stroke which seriously confused her brain she had motor movement in all her limbs but her speech wasn't very clear although she did make sense once you'd got through the alien lip movements initially i asked her whether she would like a pen and pad to communicate and she said yes her movements weren't affected by the stroke at all but because her brain was so confused she couldn't write a thing she died a week later as she had also been battling cancer for a long while the stroke was a mercy i think she was a teacher as was my mother and both were very pernickety about grammar spelling and punctuation part of this is in my genes as well i much prefer to read something where someone has made the effort to observe the particulars than something sloppily done when there are good reasons for apparent sloppiness though like dyslexia and illness i think people should stop and think for a moment before they lambast the perpetrators consequently i don't often pull someone up about their idiosyncrasies because i never know what might be the problem if there is one but i will always make an exception if someone is abusive or pointedly arrogant in their posts incidentally your 'question' seems fine to me on all points maybe lacking a comma or two but hey the gist of it is fine and makes good sense  Dyslexia Autism Stuttering Free will American and British English differences Scientology beliefs and practices Aphasia Theory of conduct Asperger syndrome GED Traumatic brain injury The nature of God in Western theology Cancer Theodicy Schizophrenia Learning disability Human A Course In Miracles Stroke Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Mental illness Quotation mark Sexual orientation Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Psychology Equine conformation Cult Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Infantilism Ethics Avenue Q Abortion debate Milton H.

why label why besides for purposes of classifcation do people insist on labeling others why not see them as what they are more importantly human beings i do and i realize that stereotypes have just as much of a likelihood of being true as untrue i have no interest in knowing people as labels i want to know them as people why am i such an oddity sometimes people find it easier to see people that way they do not see others as real people until they know them as they would know a close friend so instead of getting to know them they label them and then forget about them  A Course In Miracles Friendship Propaganda Prisoner's dilemma Human sexual behavior Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Goldstein's book Theory of conduct Alcoholics Anonymous Jon Secada Black (people) Social psychology Fundamentalism Adi Da Zhao Yun Bloody Roar Hide and Q (TNG episode) Single Transferable Vote Sant Mat Sex and the City Infantilism Meaning of life Humphrey Bogart Carpenters Pitaten Atheism Religious conversion Victor Cousin Frank Zappa Religion Operational amplifier Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle Avenue Q Bradley Nowell Sapir-Whorf hypothesis S__ren Kierkegaard Philipp Melanchthon Ontological argument Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Roswell UFO incident Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Validity of human races Albert Einstein Bisexuality Animism Recurring South Park characters Objectivist philosophy Perl Max Stirner The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars Margin of error Normal distribution Ontology (computer science) Full Metal Panic?

may i get an answer to this question i asked this question in the medical category and not one soul responded i am i big participant in the r s category so i feel safe receiving some reasonable responses and accurate information here as well since this category is very close to r s please bear with me hi everyone it's me john i am here to complain about my vision problem and i need to know if they're any help available for me i am physically challenged and my vision is becoming worse due to excessive floaters my vision is fine as far as i am concerned just the floaters that are causing complication and annoyance i was told by my eye specialist that the floaters would gradually disapear on their own like fall below my vision i asked how long this will take and they told me approximately one year or two when i first suspected a floater it looked like a tread it was not a problem at first but gradually over time the tiny little tread has become a massive cobweb covering up my beautiful vision my eyes are corrected to with glasses but when the cobweb comes across my vision my vision would be less than very poor this causes problem for me to drive at nights and even to see road signs correctly like the small road signs i have been having floaters in both eyes now for years and they only get worse i have my eyes checked on twice a year and the doctors told there is nothing they can do to remove floaters unless they blast them which will make things worse than it is the floaters were the reason i had a hard time passing my vision test at the dmv department to obtain my driver license at that time i had to wait a few seconds for the floaters to completely move out of my vision in order to read the little letters at dmv which i successfully and luckily passed however the floaters has become worse now and i might be unfortunate this year to pass my dmw vision test to renew my driver license the floaters make driving at nights risky and difficult so that s why i do not drive at nights under no circumstances tell me what help you think i can get thanks john also the doctors said i only have floaters problem so i am not going to be blind at least i am not at risk don't worry about me driving on goverment road i have been driving now for more than years and have never gotten a ticket or met in an accident and i didn't say i can't see and i am sure kids are not that small like those letter letters it scares me that you think kids are that small i meant little letters food theneedofthewea i state the facts about me to better people's understanding of who i am also you did not respond to my question you seem pretty upset i am sorry acknowledge that john i had a similar problem some years ago it appears that it is caused by bleeding from the retina into the eye fluid and if it continues damage to the retina is almost a certainty get yourself to a competent eye specialist mate don't just go to a gp i am horrified that they have said it's just floaters that's blood in there and even though most of it will be re absorbed where did it come from and why that's the question you should ask  Diabetic retinopathy Eye Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Scientology beliefs and practices Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Traumatic brain injury Prostate cancer Stomach cancer Plame affair Color Retinal detachment God Emperor of Dune Driver's license M16 (rifle) Big Brother (USA TV series) Chronic fatigue syndrome Abortion The Shining (film) Love and Theft Light pollution Floppy disk Hypoglycemia U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Resurrection of Jesus Combine (Half-Life 2) Myopia Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Stroke Urinary incontinence Retina Sin City Diabetes mellitus Tenshinhan Drunk driving (United States) Social rule Multiple sclerosis Color blindness Piccolo Junior Saga 2005 United States Grand Prix Theory of conduct 2000 Australian Grand Prix Milton H.

can you think of any obvious thing which you learnt surprisingly late examples follow no need to read from a film by truffaut the guy is trying to butter a cream cracker and the girl says to him no let me show you and puts another cracker underneath it saying see that way is much easier it prevents the cracker from breaking we can teach each other lots of things like that i always used to tie up bags e g bin bags by spinning them round to make them narrow at the top like a single piece of rope and then knotting the rope into itself twice but then i saw a friend just magically tie it up in two seconds flat without any spinning because he just took the two handles of the bag like two laces on a shoe and did a double knot i couldn't believe i hadn't thought of that before and when i was a kid i used to take off my jumper by taking my arms out and then lifting it off but then i saw a cool latin teacher who simply grabbed the collar of the jumper behind the neck and pulled it up and foreward over the head everyone in our class was amazed yes i learned to be a more aware driver at a late age i learned that i can take a full load of college classes and pass i was always afraid of taking anything over part time for fear of failing a while ago i learned to keep your shoe laces from going all over the place and stepping on them to tuck them into your shoes after tying them on both sides of the shoe i learned that patience is a virtue  Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling holds Textile manufacturing Equine conformation Rope Suplex Glossary of climbing terms Mattress Shoelaces Necktie Powerbomb Swingout Fast bowling Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Professional wrestling match types Glossary of nautical terms Shirt Climbing equipment Skateboarding trick Rigging Professional wrestling attacks Dog training Magic (illusion) Piledriver (professional wrestling) Columbine High School massacre Comanche Shaggy dog story Side pass (dance move) Shoe About a Boy Volleyball Japanese tea ceremony 1957 World Series DDT (professional wrestling) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Glossary of partner dance terms Drag racing Skinhead Textile manufacturing terminology Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Dairy Knot Robot Master Piccolo Junior Saga Baseball Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dinghy The Price Is Right Reef knot Big Brother (USA TV series) Boxing Pok__mon Live!

why is there a bet and no wet i often wonder how that tv station got away with being called bet but if there were to be a wet then it would be considered racist when do the lines become fair and not one sided i mean i am not meaning to be racist in my question but when do other races start being considered racist by their actions ok ok i don't have anything against black people but seriously we need to either decide if there is going to be exclusive white things and exclusive white things either neither or both but one shouldn't be considered more racist than the other i totaly agree i don't understand it if you can have a bet then you should have a wet if there was a wet and no bet people would be pretty pissed at one point it was ok because there was discrimination on tv but now it's not ok i think it would be best not to have either and guys it would not only feture country music  Craps Racism Betting (poker) Gambling White (people) Skinhead Theory of conduct Poker jargon The nature of God in Western theology Blacks and Mormonism Laws of cricket Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle Goodness and value theory Racial segregation 1919 World Series Sports betting White supremacy Baccarat The Silence (The Twilight Zone) Anti-Defamation League Eric Cartman Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sydney Riot of 1879 Bob Feller Euphemism Ron and Fez Parimutuel betting Black Entertainment Television Negro Black or White (Michael Jackson song) Avenue Q 2003 United States Grand Prix White nationalism Friends Texas hold 'em Discrimination Nadir of American race relations Computer chess U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Anti-racism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism White Australia policy African American Vernacular English Arab-Israeli conflict Greyhound racing Chess strategy and tactics Jealous Again Black (people) Israeli Arab Vernon Schillinger Bullshit African American Caucasian race Nigger Racism in the United States Metaphor British National Party Fair use Sexual orientation Burr Redding White separatism Modal auxiliary verb Lie Breastfeeding Race and intelligence Australian horse racing Korematsu v.

any suggestion in eliminating bad luck you just know when you are in bad luck chains of bad things keep happening despite effort to change that any suggestion my bad luck includes for example no one answers the question i posted someone hit my car and ran away and i have to pay for the fix out of my own pocket stepping on gum for no reason i didn't believe in luck for sometimes i used to think bad things happen for a reason and that we can learn from it and make ourselves stronger but bad things just happen and sometimes there's no lesson to be learn nor make the world better face it there's no such a thing as bad luck what there is it's cause and effect on our own decisions that we take being responsible and irresponsible there's a bit of karma involved and this has to do a lot with your personal actions toward yourself and others so take it easy and everytime something happen to you take it as an opportunity to learn to be better more selfconcious less materialistic and more toward evolving as a better being  Luck Causality Social rule Predestination Theory of conduct Determinism Theodicy Kimi Finster Rincewind Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Poker jargon Ethics I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Magical thinking Mojave people Meme Pitaten Free will Plame affair Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Bad Wolf Whose Line Is It Anyway?

asking questions about our society means you're anti american okay so i just posted a question a little while ago about assimilation in american society and the feedback i got was very interesting many people took offense in the fact that i even had the nerve to question american society don't get me wrong i'm proud of where i come from too but i thought one of the highlights of being american was freedom of speach and the right to question things because i asked this question people automatically assumed that i was taking a stance on a political issue such as immigration one gentleman even asked me to just come out and say it i was doing no such thing all i wanted to know was to what extent must we assimilate into american society if that was so offensive then i apologize but i really don't think it was it wasn't anti american it was anti their perspective many pple feel that their opinion on things is an attack on them but it's an attack on that concept since many hold their same stance when you come to any country you have to assimilate or what i really like to refer to as accommodate when you accommodate you are fitting in new stuff with what you all ready know you aren't changing anything you are just accepting some things to fit in you are accepting the new and keeping the old assimilation is when you are changing something usually has an uncomfortable feeling attached you have to throw out something old and replace it with the new immigration well it is accommodation imo they need to learn the communal customs of americans and accept some things like our language you shouldn't come up to someone and just start speaking spanish like we all speak it this isn't mexico they can still keep their traditions  Extreme Programming Franz Boas Social rule Abortion debate Theory of conduct Cultural relativism Melting pot Shaggy dog story Milton H.

is anyone else worried that adolescent females on here only ask questions about being too fat how to lose weight what is popular to wear i have yet to see a site for a target shirt or wanting someone to do their math homework for them what does this say about the focus our american youth has in life and if i see one more year old girl asking question about different types of condoms i'm gettin my tubes tied well i admit i am guilty of some of those things im btw but you just helped me to see how pathetic that actually is it's a shame that youth waste valuable mental power on ridiciulous things regarding appearances and what to wear to josh's party i feel that the psychological need to be accepted socially may play a role in this but many have the choice to focus they're goals not on pleasing the crowd but helping the crowd there is so much potential in youth to accomplish more in their lives if people would only stop being so lazy and directing their energy to more positive things sure asking a question is fine but it becomes a serious matter when it is priority  Sexual orientation Suicide Ethics Social psychology Adolescence Infantilism Transsexuality Anorexia nervosa Sexual abstinence Goodness and value theory Jon Secada Sex education Psychoanalysis Boy Scouts of America Grunge music Transactional analysis Dieting Cultural Revolution Procrastination A Course In Miracles Alcoholics Anonymous Child sexuality Hikikomori Sin City Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Scientology beliefs and practices Rape Scouting Education in the People's Republic of China Gender role Weight training EastEnders Narcissism Sigmund Freud Swami Vivekananda Shaggy dog story Incarnations of Immortality Calvin and Hobbes Clinical depression Reparative therapy Magical thinking Cult Characters in the Smurfs Abortion debate Aikido Theory of conduct Social rule Undergarment Neuro-linguistic programming Pedophilia Sexual differentiation Cultural relativism Megan Griffin Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Asperger syndrome Internet troll Breastfeeding Fahrenheit 9/11 U.S. Electoral College Fashion Sinfest Marilyn Monroe Sydney Riot of 1879 Puberty Nutrition Female genital cutting Evil Domestic rabbit Androgen insensitivity syndrome Opus Dei BDSM Obi-Wan Kenobi Growth hormone treatment Survivor: Palau Football (soccer) The Beach Boys RuneScape Meaning of life Mathematics Philip J.

how to gain some confidence and be a good leader every single time i really want to run for being a president of a club at school or just live my life i always think what if people don't like me what are they going to think about me will i actaully be a good leader and these thoughts and questions always get in the way of me reaching my goals i also have a naturally small voice so i guess that contributes to my lack of confidence also or is it that my voice is small because i'm unconfident oh i don't know truthfully i feel really stupid that i let these thoughts get to me and i really want to change myself and the image of what other people see me as because i'm pretty sure i come off as a shy and unconfident person please give me some advice d being a good leader to me means being committed being willing to take responsibility and being true to one's own ethics regardless of popularity i am reserved and introvert myself but i found myself a leader in many situations it's easier when i see others afraid to take the lead i'm impatient so i would take on the role of a leader just to get things going in group sessions leadership like any other skill takes practice the more often you take on the responsibility of a leader the easier it gets with time you may be a leader already and not know it my twin sister is such a take no quarter person and was charismatic she was always a leader in sports in groups of friends in the workplace and clubs i didn't realize till later on in life that i had a leadership role in my family dynamics among my own group of friends and in my own interests remember that despite polls and the media driven democratic process a true leader does not care about being liked only doing what's right i've known people who ran for office in hs didn't get elected but the courage to try and learn something from unsuccessful opportunities made them a leader later on in life no leader becomes one without risk no great leader becomes one without taking something enriching away from every circumstance while i don't think a loud voice means confidence and it often means the opposite you can modulate your tone to express something with finality rather than with a question at the end ever hear someone whose every sentence sounds like a question makes me wonder if they believe in anything they say chin up if a soft spoken shy person like me can now enjoy the spotlike and the power of being a leader so can you  Consensus decision-making Social rule Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Singlish Scientology beliefs and practices Plame affair Jon Secada Leadership Workplace democracy Ethics Time Out of Mind Social psychology Canadian House of Commons Kim Possible Theory of conduct Sharon Tate Milton H.

will hurricane katrina have positive effect on new orleans long term to get all the poor lower income residents back that's a really great question in my opinion the american government isn't going out of it's way to rectify this matter and is in no hurry to do so how much has changed since then not much the government agenda is to take over the land from defenseless owners that can't fight back due to lack of funding the courts have already sided with the insurance companies that have unlimited funds to lobby in their favor the only so called positive effects will be for the builders that receive the land stealing government contracts handed out to those with political connections  Political effects of Hurricane Katrina Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans Capitalism Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Insurance Property tax Publicly funded medicine Federal Emergency Management Agency of the United States Gross domestic product Israeli settlement Hurricane Rita Taxation in the United States Tax Democracy George W.

what's the most embarrassing moment of your life this goes back to when i worked for a defense contractor in berlin at an air force post each morning when i arrived for work at marienfelde station i had to wait in line to go through a pair of turnstiles on one particular morning i was rather anxious to get to my turn because the bratwurst beer and assorted bar foods from the night before had left me feeling a bit inflated a crowded line and common courtesy made me wait until i was outside the security gate finally i was let through the first turnstile i dropped my back pack in the 'teller box' and waited for them to search it while i tried not to dance they returned my pack and buzzed me through the second turnstile as soon as i got outside i let go it wasn't gaseous in my haste i had skipped safety protocol and let go at too great a speed to abort i now had a problem i'm standing at the foot of a small hill with about steps to the top and there's no way i can turn back go through security again and take the bus back to my apartment i started forward i took extra care at each step so as not to lift a leg to high and tip the balance judging by the weight of my trousers i was in imminent danger of spillage if i didn't take extreme care on i went moving slowly and woodenly i was being passed by people who had just been far behind me in line they must have suspected me of carrying one mean hangover i prayed that the wind was carrying away the majority of the smell when i finally reached the main facility of course the first floor bathroom was being cleaned the other bathroom is on the second floor more steps these a steep staircase i had to be more cautious the liquid load in my briefs felt like it was perched to run down my leg with each step i got to the top and finally my luck turned for the better the bathroom was open and no one was in the stall i shut the stall behind me and quickly assessed the damage the briefs were unrecoverable i had to remove my pants to take them off and dispose of them i had to remove my shoes to take off my pants using all the balance and coordination i could muster i untied and slipped out of my shoes then stepped very gingerly out of my pants finally with utmost care i lowered and stepped out of the briefs now what there's a built in trashcan out there but i am naked from the waist down and the briefs are very ripe i looked at the toilet good german make the bore at the bottom looked to be big enough to pass a large fist i dropped my briefs in and flushed the water immediately rose to the top of the bowl and began spilling over i snatched my pants off the floor and out of the way of the coming flood and stood on my shoes to keep my socks dry the water kept coming i snatched the briefs out of the bottom of the bowl the water receded now i am standing on my shoes in my stocking feet in the middle of a growing puddle naked from the waist down holding my pants in one hand and some very soiled and now soaked and dripping underwear in my other hand i had run out of options i elbowed open the latch shouldered the stall door open and peeked out i was still alone i stepped over the puddle as best i could and out of the stall i took two of the four steps to the trash can in walked the captain of the station  Aerial (dance move) Toilet humour Professional wrestling holds Swingout Undergarment

do you think the naked human body is disgusting please read because of recent debates on reporting graphic material on ya i had to ask this important question when i have encountered certain report content question people will say well that's just disgusting or i hate that and so on from there so my question is do you think that the naked human body is disgusting and or naked pictures of anyone is disgusting male and or female then i would like to hear from everyone who answers the educated answer why you have come to this conclusion about the naked human body i would ask that you think about this one before you answer please don't be a hypocrite regarding previous answers thanks being a nudist i am not ashamed or disgusted by nudity for pure nudity sake like groups of ppl being nude together or ppl at a nude beach or nude resort or nude exercising swimming socializing this i would say is not considered vulgar or perverted at least to me but what i would consider vulagar nudity is when being nude is when nudity in film photos or in drawing or in person is showing copulation or things in ofrices of the human body porn is not very appealing to me its vulgar but nudity in artistic depictions of the nude human is very acceptable and the human being is a beautiful creation that should not be concealed behind yards of unnecessary cloth early ancient ppls and civilizations had many forms of art sculpture drawings carvings paintings of the nude human figure and the religious places of worship had and continue to have nude works of art the only reason nudity is not allowed and more common in everyday life in the u s is because hollywood and the media have sensationized on strong victorian puritan based morals and laws that we inherited from europe that say nudity is sinful and wrong my augument is that ancient civilizations like the romans greeks chinese egyptian and even some modern day civilizations on the amazon had and have no problem with the nude human even the bible discusses how adam and eve were nude and happy and god was pleased that what he created was in the nude so all this adds upto is that nudism is not wrong at all its the religious right and media that continues to make nudism a crime and they continue to make or have made laws based on narrow religious views and make public nudity a crime of indecency when its not at all my being nude in public is not hurting anyone physically at all if done in a appropiate surroundings like hiking or swimming worshipping nature yoga in the nude at state and national parks or even local municipal parks but not being nude at places where the young are like kiddie areas playgrounds public pools etc  Nudity in sport Child pornography Pornography Hentai Sculpture Religion Ten Commandments Video game controversy Pornography in Japan Creationism Human Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Original sin Art in Ancient Greece Origin belief Motion picture rating system Justification (theology) Indecent pseudo-photograph of a child Homosexuality and Christianity Adam and Eve God Nude beach Swimming pool Sharon Tate Social aspects of clothing Figure drawing Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Abortion debate MPAA film rating system Religious conversion Homosexuality Modesty Zoophilia Simone Weil Sauna Sexual orientation Religion and sexuality Undergarment Property (ownership right) Swimming Infant baptism Paradise Lost Renaissance Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Separation of church and state Capital punishment Taoism Indecent exposure Soul Judaism Reincarnation Eastern Orthodox Church Modernism Censorship in Australia Idolatry Neopaganism Atomism Art Religion and sexual orientation Theodicy Teach the Controversy Alan Campbell (pastor) Theory of conduct Young Earth creationism Philosophy Charles Grandison Finney A Course In Miracles New Testament David Hume Puritan Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Evil Same-sex marriage YMCA Trinity History of creationism Jewish views of religious pluralism Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Philo Supernatural Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Appeal Satan EastEnders Consciousness State The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Swimsuit Clothing

is it okay to wear short shorts to work business professional setting high school or college a lot of women ladies females have started a fashion trend of wearing certain length shorts or skirts during business hours is it just me or it seems like people in america have started used intimates or lounge wear as part of regular wardrobe during business hours to give you a few examples flip flops tank tops shorts shorts denim skirts basketball shorts i am not sure if this fashion trend is occurring internationally but would like to hear so on this topic it certainly is happening in the u s most businesses have a dress code if you are to be seen by the public they have to keep up a certain standard which is different from place to place they may also have casual day and allow jeans and such there are always individuals who want to be themselves and push the limits or just break right through any limits in most cases just ignore it in some cases going to the manager or higher will give them the push they need to correct this individual or put them into a less public job personally i really don't care what people wear most of the time as long as they do a good job and give me excellent service and don't smell bad or look dirty short shorts might draw my attention for a moment but be dismissed as long as they are doing their best just now someone walked in dressed nicely but underwear showing that's a fashion trend i could live without but really does what they are wearing hurt anything if it is going to give an old guy a heart attack then someone should tell them not to wear it for safety reasons some people just have to go too far trying to set a new fashion trend or get attention i guess live well and do good  Social aspects of clothing Social rule Skirt and dress Undergarment Trousers Gender role Suit (clothes) Culture of the United States Theory of conduct Jeans Swimming pool Pantyhose Kilt Tightlacing Clothing Aerial (dance move) Coat (clothing) Bob Jones University Cross-dressing Fashion Professional wrestling slang High-heeled shoe Volleyball Little Britain Skinhead The Apprentice 2 Buckingham Palace Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Extreme Programming Japanese tea ceremony Strap-on dildo Heavy metal fashion Shoe Fast bowling Marilyn Monroe Beachwear Clothing terminology Shirt Bondage (BDSM) Roxette Jesuit College Preparatory School Celebrity Laws of cricket Cricket Paul Is Dead Password The Devil Wears Prada Lawrence v.

what do you think last year i was really bored with my life all i did was go to school and nothing else it wasnt depressing but it seemed meaningless since then i have found a whole load of new friends outside of school and we meet up every friday and saturday or even a weekday and get pissed on vodka and alcopops in town or up the hills it has been every week of so far and we all talk and sing and take the piss out of stuff go into town and ask for mints from the take away owners and then run around the beach in the middle of the night screaming it is the most fun i have ever had and ive never been happier but i know that underage drinking is illegal and it must be completely screwed up my insides but i dont think i could stop and i really dont want to ive grown so close to my friends now i never want it to end take a step back for a moment and observe yourself you now have already acknowleged that the booze is probably not good for you so why are you doing it self medicating to relieve having to deal with the reality we all must face in our lives during all this how are your grades doing you sound like you are lonesome and have some relationship needs this group of people may temporarily be taking you mind off the empty feelings in your life but after awhile they will grow old either in your eyes or theirs then what why not talk to someone you really respect and trust including possible alcohol addiction issues which you may realize is an issue now you can start to turn life around now or sink deeper into your situation it all starts with you wanting to make changes that serve your future and not the moment have you ever thought about feelig gratitude for your life your good physical health etc feeling gratitude is a prayer unto itself wen you get out of yourself and reach out to help others you give meaning to your life why not give it a shot namaste jasper  The Ashlee Simpson Show Shaggy dog story About a Boy Social rule Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Sin City Pitaten Scenes from a Memory One Tree Hill (TV series) Alcoholics Anonymous The Beach Boys Humphrey Bogart Friends Blood on the Tracks Current teachings of Prem Rawat Milton H.

do you believe in destiny or do you believe that we have control over our own lives i believe both over a lifetime most people get numerous opportunities or at least come to forks in the road where the choice determines their future path sometimes there is no going back we exert control getting to those points but the day and time when the decision must be made is often thrust upon us we steer but the waves and the wind carry us to our destination  Sailing Canoe 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Determinism Predestination Car handling Destiny STS-114 Weather forecasting Anchor USS Intrepid (CV-11) Incarnations of Immortality Navigation War of 1812 Spacecraft propulsion Space shuttle main engine Force Kain (Legacy of Kain) Aircraft 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Attitude control Many-worlds interpretation Inertial guidance system Solar sail Grand Forks, North Dakota Breaststroke Recumbent bicycle Myocardial infarction Formula One regulations Newton's laws of motion USS Aaron Ward (DD-483) Current teachings of Prem Rawat Cassini-Huygens Bicycle brake systems Abortion debate Rocket Mars Time travel Long Path 1997 Pacific hurricane season Delta Tau Delta Free will Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity USS Anderson (DD-411) Legend of Zelda series songs Chopper (motorcycle) Chess terminology Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Airbus A320 Priesthood (Mormonism) Route assignment Trip distribution Vehicular cycling Algorithm Jet engine USS San Francisco (CA-38) Motorcycle STS-59 Hannibal Michelson-Morley experiment USS Stewart (DD-224) Path dependence Astrodynamics USS Atlanta (CL-51) G-Man (Half-Life) Economic inequality Steering wheel Propeller Horse tack Avalanche Action (physics) Saturn V Decision making Corporate governance USS Astoria (CA-34) The Five Doctors Microphone Christian eschatology USS Wasp (CV-7) Pratitya-samutpada Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)

why is it that whenever a kid kills other children that they blame video games and comics i don't get it why blame comics or games they have nothing to do with the fact that johnny the little homicidal maniac decided to go shoot up his school why not just say that little johnny has problems i don't wanna go on a curse ridden tirade again but my point is why do parents just have to point to video games and comics when they obviously aren't the problem if his parents had just saw the game itself instead of trusting their kids to be the cute little angels they think they are they should've seen the game or read the comic which had thousands of warning labels on just the cover why not just read the comic and play the game and at least take a peek in the child's room and just reveal hey you've got an entire knife collection firearms vault and a connection to the atomic bomb something is wrong with you and what's with those jesus camps owned by pastor becky fischer they're creeping me right the hell out why should kids care if the world's going wrong why are kids supposed to be the legion of the lord they're kids they're just kids god gave us a freedom to learn and a freedom to choice the fundamentalist movement of becky fischer is really harming the psyches of out children indoctrination is wrong you can make a kid into a radical with an ak kids believe anything how do we ignore that we're making children soldiers harry potter's a fictional character it shouldn't matter if he's using an ouiji board can you say brainwashing we're only making soldiers for the gop how does that fit into what jesus wanted for us god watches and has a place for those messing with our kids what sets us apart from other countries is that we separate chuch from state don't let fundamentalism bleed into schools i believe that you're wrong insinuating they hold a bomb paving the way for the oil brigade paving the way for the oil brigade exactly read the book and check the rating don't pretend you're blind i'll give you the problem its a parenting problem parents have the right no the obligation to look at the esrb rating that's what it's there for and to look through comics before either buying it or letting the kid play read it parents don't get it and it's pissing me off edit also i read that this high ranking general in the u s army is trying to make the war in the middle east a neo crusade or something and trying to indoctrinate his soliders into the army of god also with kids fundies are doing what sadam did in the first gulf war making kids soliders for their nation or beliefs that's why let the kids make their own damn choices when they're old enough to make them but nooo most christians don't get that part of it god it's annoying  Poker jargon Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism God Theodicy Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Columbine High School massacre Jack Thompson Separation of church and state The Catcher in the Rye Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Punisher Humphrey Bogart Canon (fiction) Baptist The Marshall Mathers LP Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Bowling for Columbine Church of Christ Opposition to cults and new religious movements Free will Ex-gay Motion picture rating system Church of Christ, Scientist Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Opus Dei The Amber Spyglass Nation of Islam Suicide bombing Time travel Fundamentalism Mystique (comics) The Death Gate Cycle Death (personification) Miss Saigon Recurring South Park characters Fischer Random Chess Philosophical skepticism Gun politics Religious conversion Abortion debate Transactional analysis True Crime: Streets of LA Children of God StarCraft: Uprising Daredevil Shaggy dog story Abington School District v.

racism is a setback for those races who have suffered descrimination in the past and have fought for equality why do some of you still hold bitter feelings toward caucasions doesn't racism and bias do nothing but perpetuate racism and bias i'm not trying to offend i am truly curious moonjogger your point is well made but why would you assume that i would think of you as a highschool drop out and unwed mother that is exactly what i'm talking about every comment or assumption like that that is made set us all back you are very correct racism and bias do nothing but add to the racism and biases that are already present in our society as an african american woman i have seen more than my fair share of racism i recently graduated from a very prestigious college in the country only months ago predominately white even at this institution of higher learning the n word was used there was an affirmative action bake sale that sold brownies for to caucasian and for to african americans this bake sale was to illustrate that african americans are given hand outs when the fact of the matter is if this group had done proper research they would know that low socioeconomic caucasian women benefit the most from affirmative action not only that but i served as an ra for years and my first year the n word was carved on the back of a bathroom stall on my hall i was the only african american out of females living there i said all that to say while racism is a thing of the past it is still a thing of the present and will be a thing of the future it is terrible that any race should discriminate against another this includes african americans against caucasians it is a shame that bitter feelings are still held by some african american towards caucasians as it is a shame that some caucasians still engage in both overt and covert racism i think that in situations like these both parties are to blame not just the african americans that do this not just the caucasians that do this but both groups while there are some african americans that feel this way there are some that do not just like some caucasians may do things like the aforementioned while some do not while i understand you are not trying to offend and most certainly have not offended me i think it is important not to generalize on either the caucasian or the african american experience when it comes to these matters hope this helped a lil take care  Affirmative action White (people) African American Black (people) African American contemporary issues Model minority Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Divorce Ethnic issues in Japan Domestic violence Liberalism Plame affair Breastfeeding Commonwealth of Nations Multiculturalism Media and ethnicity Intelligence quotient Laisenia Qarase African American Vernacular English Validity of human races Media bias Racial segregation Equal Protection Clause Rape Whose Line Is It Anyway?

should all big girls be skinny the reason i ask is because ive seen so many big girls that become skinny and sometimes they look better big then they do skinny and i'm not even attracted to big girls for example did you people see star jones lately omg what yall think first of all the point of wether or not your attracted to big girls isn't important we all have our own ideas of what is and isn't considered big all of us are what we are and if we try to change that to make another person or society happy then all we are doing is proving that we have low self esteem and will do anything everything to get other's to take notice of us even if you don't take notice of a big girl trust me there is someone out there who will yes some big girls don't look right skinny i e star jones i think she was beautiful big but now she just looks scary i feel for her couse i think she lost the weight the wrong way and for the wrong reasons if a woman wants to lose weight she should do it for her and not for anyone anything else  Theory of conduct Social rule Philosophical skepticism Skinny Puppy Humphrey Bogart Utilitarianism Goodness and value theory Spice Girls The Emancipation of Mimi Pedophilia Supply and demand Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) Sexual attraction Obesity Transsexuality Current teachings of Prem Rawat American Psycho Poker jargon Peter Singer David Hume Undergrads AFI 100 Years series Star Ocean: The Second Story Barbra Streisand Human sexual behavior The Critic Wonderland (McFly album) Friends Jughead Jones Self-esteem Anorexia nervosa EastEnders The Apprentice 2 Transgender Objectivist philosophy Wedding Crashers Louise Brooks Scouting Hall & Oates Ontological argument Piccolo Junior Saga Value system Social psychology F.

does anyone else get totally irritated in tescos i sometimes shop in tesco and they have habits which get right up my nose for instance the way that the checkout people are trained to robotically say do you need help with your packing to every customer now if i have a full trolley fair enough but when i've just popped in for a pint of milk and eggs it's totally annoying and patronising i feel like saying yes i do need a hand just so they will have to drag someone from the far end of the store just to put my items into a plastic bag then when i pay with my chip and pin credit card which i usually do there is the annoying way that they say please put your pin number in despite the fact that they can see me looking at the little screen with my index finger poised do they assume i'm in some sort of trance or unable to read the instructions and i hate their computerised do it yourself checkouts apart from the fact that if i am spending money in their store i expect to at least be served by a human being i find it quite funny when i buy one item and im asked if i want help with my packing 'nope i think i can manage quite well on my own thankyou ' i was actually put off a while ago by the store manager i went up to him to ask where the salsa was he asked if i wanted to dance grabbed my hands and danced up and down the isle i was not impressed very embarrassed as for the diy checkouts i'd much rather use them when i'm in a bad mood or feeling antisocial plus i get some kind of satisfaction hearing that 'beep ' trouble is when you get 'please wait for assistance ' or 'approval needed ' that puts me in an even worse mood  Tesco Electronic commerce Sears Holdings Corporation Poker jargon Aldi Computer Dairy Loyalty program Futurama (TV series - season 5) Little Britain RFID Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Episodes of Lost (Season 1) RISC Shaggy dog story Milton H.

minneapolis vs st paul i often hear you shouldn't move to the east side of the twin cities because it's different what do people mean when they say that i ask and they never elaborate my theory is the west side is distinctly midwestern where the east is not could that be the reason love the twin cities don't get me wrong but it's sort of a running joke about wouldn't be caught dead in the city across the river and it is said by people on both sides of the river i live on the minneapolis side and can count on one hand how many times i've been in st paul this year it's not for any other reason that whatever i need is within a three miles radius of where i live st paul is a smaller town than minneapolis the one challenge about st paul is that their street names and numbers can give you a headache in minneapolis the city is on an easy to understand grid for most of the city no matter where you go in the twin cities each neighborhood has it's own profile and sometimes it can change within blocks if you are looking to make a move and you don't live in minnesota i would try and find a place to live close to where you work and go from there the links i have for you below are some very interesting stats and if it hadn't been for your question i wouldn't have found them hope this helps a little ps mary tyler moore lived on kenwood parkway in minneapolis  Saint Paul, Minnesota The Mary Tyler Moore Show University of Minnesota Minneapolis-St. Paul Minneapolis, Minnesota Minnesota Minnesota Twins Theory of conduct Hiawatha Line Twin cities Washington Avenue Bridge (Minneapolis) Mississippi River Grand Forks, North Dakota WCCO Twin City Rapid Transit Manhattan Epistemology Interstate 94 Bloomington, Minnesota Milwaukee, Wisconsin Friends Jon Secada U.S. Highway 1 Streets and highways of Chicago Blood on the Tracks Nicollet Mall Midwestern United States Time Out of Mind Minnesota Transportation Museum Social rule Paul Is Dead West Side Highway Mary Tyler Moore Duluth, Minnesota Shot of Love Softball Aerial (dance move) Chicago and North Western Railway Interstate 35 Knots Landing Minnesota River Blaine, Minnesota Roger Maris University of Minnesota system Underground city Conway's Game of Life The nature of God in Western theology Fargo, North Dakota Mojave people Newark City Subway U.S. Electoral College Falsifiability String theory Halting problem Margin of error University Avenue (Minneapolis-St. Paul) Augsburg College Terri Schiavo Indiana state highways Star Tribune Neighborhoods of Minneapolis Humphrey Bogart Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Black hole Theodicy The Replacements Chess strategy and tactics Minnesota State Highway 62 The Dalek Invasion of Earth Long Path Sudoku Philosophical skepticism Minesweeper (computer game) Ontological argument Leicester City Centre Mall of America Dog agility Neighbours Pedophilia Metro Transit (Minnesota) Craps Fridley, Minnesota Geography of Washington, D.C. 400-Series Highways Philosophy of language Roxette Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport Socrates David Hume Metaphysics Uptown, Minneapolis 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Williamsburg, Virginia Scientific method Jumpstart 3rd Grade Samuel Goldwyn Cork BMT Canarsie Line Carl Barks Paradox

how far should you let rascism affect you life my husband i want a large family we want to have kids biologicly adopt i was raised to not see the color of someones skin my husband was raised to actually believe that black people are generaly alright but shouldn't be allowed to mix with white i'm glad to say he doesn't believe in this although thats how his parents are now when i look online at adoptable children the majority of them are black one girl in particular i just fell in love with right away considered adopting her then i realized how his parents would react how where we live theres maybe a black population how other's backwards attitudes might affect not only us but the child now i can handle rascist remarks would be ready to stand up for my child but i worry about the child if it would be a negative affect on her i would love her make a good mother for her but is that enough in todays society everyone says racism's a thing of the past but is it really tell me what your opinion is her and i are such a perfect match she is five and sooo pretty she has some emotional problems and i've studied psychology for several years and believe i can help her she's also very close to her brother who she's lived with all her life but recently was taken out of his home because although he did his best he wasn't able to fully provide for her and he gave her up which was hard on both of them and if i adopt her i plan to make sure they stay in touch she also has found a love in swimming which is my favorite hobby as well she loves visiting the beach and my family goes to the beach at least twice a year it just seems so right thank you all for your answers rascism is still very much alive but i dont think it should effect you when it comes to a child take this as an opportunity to cultivate that little girl and help her to understand the beauty of every skin color its unfortunate that your husband's family think the way they do but you cant change there minds all you can do is show them by your actions that they are wrong use your actions and not just your words if they still choose to not be apart of their grandchild's life it will be their loss not hers and definitely not yours  Theory of conduct Infantilism EastEnders Transactional analysis Jon Secada Microeconomics Pitaten One Tree Hill (TV series) Friends W.I.T.C.H.

do you think anyone who wants to come and live in the uk bad enough should have learned basic english prior to putting in their application has it got to the stage where we only want to be encouaging incomers who share our values and want to be no different to us after a generation or two do you think this language clause should be required from all applicants or only from those who come from communities that have already demonstrated problems in their level of commitment to integrate ie muslims on the grounds that we know all the others whoever they are african chinese inuit polish brazillian etc etc etc will be no different to us and speaking perfect english after a generation of uk schooling but that muslims will still want to continue keeping themselves separate not speaking english unless it suits them and wanting to bring in more of their own segregation minded people from poor backward areas of the world i think that is quite a fair thing to say many other countries expect immigrants to speak the language and pass a test before getting resident status i think that there should be stages the entrance exam which requires basic english and then say a year later a more advanced exam which requires a greater understanding in order to get resident status i think asylum seekers should be exempt from taking the entrance exam however as they may have been forced here under very short notice but should nonetheless pass the advanced exam in due time longer than a year as they're at a disadvantage to normal immigrants this should apply to everyone of course people who already speak english well could just demonstrate so rather than having to take an exam making exceptions based on race or religion is wrong muslims are not the only people who keep themselves seperate and they also integrate as well too just look at the british abroad spain for instance they live in british communities speak no spanish use no spanish business people where expats are available muslims are no exception for non integration  Education in the United States Graduate school GED Passport Advanced Placement Program A-level Israeli Arab British nationality law Education in Portugal American and British English differences Affirmative action Racism Multilingual Education in Romania Esperanto as an international language Freedom of speech History of British nationality law Separation of church and state Irish nationality law Grade (education) Public domain Juris Doctor Education in Hong Kong Marriage Second language acquisition German language Driver's license Education in Germany Charter of the French Language Hispanic Immigration to the United Kingdom Education in Malaysia Enlargement of the European Union Status of religious freedom in Sudan European Convention on Human Rights Immigration to the United States Languages in the United States Franz Boas Numerus clausus Democracy Education in Australia Divorce Spanish language Visual Basic English as an additional language Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Judicial review XML Same-sex marriage Debugging Cultural Revolution Copyright law of the United Kingdom Education in Taiwan Education in England Extreme Programming English language First Amendment to the United States Constitution Politics of Hong Kong Trinidad and Tobago Speech synthesis United Kingdom corporation tax Demographics of Brazil Chinese language Life insurance Equal Protection Clause Singlish Religious Society of Friends International English Bosniaks Java programming language Simon Commission Expert system Notary public Chinese martial arts Jew Martial art Value system Logic Test (student assessment) Mexico Fair use Ethnic groups of the Philippines Refugee Philosophy Amateur radio Meme Linked list Same-sex marriage in Canada Cantonese (linguistics) Demographics of Japan

why racist is such a big problem in us more than any country i dont understand why in the country that claim freedom is the highest value in their life evidently have the higher racist problem from other country who never use freedom to live speak bla bla bla as their value we're not speaking about how nazi kill jew or what happen in bosnia few years ago but in daily life why racist is such a big problem in other country i've never seen it for example in uk there's plenty indian and chinese but it doesnt matter also in germany there's plenty turks arabs italy but it did not clash like this i'm not saying my country is free from racist not country free from racist that's nonsense i live in indonesia where thousand of races exist sumateranese javanese sundanese papuanese etc and yeah we often say 'ow that's because he's sundanese' or 'she's bataknese what could you say ' but i guess we try to be more tolerant these days while from the media and movies i see in us racist problem become bigger lynossa personally i don't think americans in general are any more racist than anyone else i have traveled around the world and i have observed that everywhere people are most comfortable with those who are most like themselves culturally first and then racially don't let the media form your ideas for you yes there are people in the united states who definitely hate folks of other races that includes jews arabs blacks whites native americans chinese vietnamese korean laotian mexicans eskimos etc etc if you look for hate you will always find it if you look for the common ground between all peoples you will also find it in time it is my belief that our species will come to it's senses and learn to live as one family governments do not help when they constantly fan the flames of fear in order to keep us afraid of people of other nations and beliefs that way we let them commit unspeakable crimes against us and our enemies in order to keep us safe all in all considering the huge assault on our culture and traditions in this country that has taken place over the last thirty years i am surprised we haven't had outright race and cultural wars in this nation i don't think any other nation has had to absorb as much change as we have during the same period of time i don't know how it will all turn out but i am rather proud at how well we have generally behaved during this challenging time of transition peace be unto you will  Southeast Asia Nationalism Black (people) South Africa Democracy Bosniaks Indonesia Javanese language Nation of Islam British National Party Jews in the Middle Ages Franz Boas Hispanic Racism in the United States Japanese war crimes Freedom of speech Singapore Propaganda Java (island) Holocaust denial White nationalism Refugee Theory of conduct Islam Chinese character Ethnic issues in Japan Mein Kampf American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Asian Ethnic cleansing Anti-Zionism Population transfer Creationism Family name Nigger Asian American White (people) Joke Anti-communism White supremacy Indigenous peoples of the Americas Max Weber History of Europe Left-wing politics God Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Chinese language White separatism Israeli Arab Religious pluralism Noam Chomsky New anti-Semitism Conservatism Transactional analysis Polygamy Race (U.S. Census) Western world History of South Africa in the apartheid era Aryan race Free trade Confucianism Racial segregation Epeli Ganilau Mahatma Gandhi Arabs and anti-Semitism Atheism Who is a Jew?

are you the same in the 'virtual' world as you are in the 'real' world i mean do you behave the same way or are do you do or say things that you would never do in the real world because you know you are never going to meet these ppl for real i would say i'm pretty much the same however i am bolder in that i ask questions that i wouldn't necessarily ask 'real' friends and i'm more forward in that i wouldn't approach total strangers in 'real' life and just strike up a conversation how about u dan i wtf i really really hope you're not like that in the real world coz if you are i would be very very worried sarah that's an interesting point alot of ppl don't realise they can be traced through their i p address so if they commit a crime in the virtual world they can be prosecuted in the real world it helps if you know a police officer though that's a really good question as i've been wondering that sometimes you see such nasty rude answers and i think surely in the 'real world' people are nt like that on the same note when someone says something or takes the time out to find you some information or share their knowledge with you i wonder are they doing it for me or for the points thats the cynic in me but its nice to see actually people in the main seem to be saying they are as they appear a few years ago i was a rather selfish being just had been through some hard times and felt like the world owed me but after in having to undergo huge operations and hairloss after it was found i had tumours i really changed and the me i put out there now is the me i am with everyone and i'm proud of this person i say what i think i treat as i am treated and i really want to help support laugh with empathise with everyone i really feel strongly that our beautiful country is all too easily slipping inot a civil war of sorts where we're all afraid of oyr 'neighbour' and dont take the time out this is a good starting point to extend love to someone we most likely wont ever know out of here sorry deviated a bit x  Theory of conduct Social rule EastEnders God Emperor of Dune Milton H.

shouldn't celebrities have a minimum of questions and answers on yahoo answers obviously yahoo answers is open to anyone with a yahoo account well until they violate the guidelines but these celebrities sign up with their agents then they come up with a decent question to ask then they are shown as official and the question is highlighted and deemed important so hundreds or thousands of people answer the question yet most of the time that celebrity never actually picks a best answer most of those questions are still open after months have passed it is obvious that the said celebrity is not even paying attention to the question so they don't even care what the answer is i notice that a lot of hard working answering people will get their account deleted because of one bad answer or question even though they are just explaining their point of view but they are at least making decent contributions to the answers communities and since celebrities are above normal answers people then they need higher standards and should have to participate more i am pretty sure that bill s is senile i've only seen a couple of questions by celebrities or more likely by their agents who apparently don't have enough real work and i only actually read one of them and i don't remember what it was that tells you how much i pay attention to famous people but if they do post a question they should be required to abide by the same rules we do if they let it go to a public vote it shouldn't stay on the board any longer than ours but better yet they should pick a best answer themselves or else not even bother asking it they have loyal fans who take the time to answer a question expecting that the movie star or whoever will actually read it it shows a lack of respect when they don't read it at all but relegate the whole process to their agents  Theory of conduct Plame affair Social rule Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus $ale of the Century Wheel of Fortune Altruism The Internet Movie Database The Apprentice 2 Poker jargon GED E-mail spam Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses H2G2 Public-key cryptography National Football League Equal Protection Clause 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Open Directory Project U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Intelligent design movement GNU General Public License Health insurance Match Game Salary cap Discordianism Philosophy of language Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Philosophical skepticism Supreme Court of the United States Contract Article One of the United States Constitution Parliament of Canada John Lott Karl Rove National Kidney Foundation Singapore Creation-evolution controversy Freedom of information legislation Floppy disk Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Copyleft Intelligent design Scientology beliefs and practices Unemployment Hollywood Squares Live 8 Philosophy of mathematics Bill Maher Microeconomics Samuel Goldwyn Jacob Neusner Infant baptism 2003 California recall Extreme Programming First Amendment to the United States Constitution Education in Romania Avenue Q Mensal__o scandal 9/11 conspiracy theories Separation of church and state in the United States Administrative law of the United States Life insurance Socrates Sarbanes-Oxley Act Young Earth creationism I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Terrell Owens Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe SAT Ronald Dworkin Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Philosophy of science Second language acquisition Little Britain Family Feud 2channel Game show Stochastic process Password The nature of God in Western theology Martial art Sponsorship scandal Corporate governance Internet troll Halakha Copenhagen interpretation Software engineering Same-sex marriage in Canada Bah__'__ divisions 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Abortion debate Ra (board game) Bogdanov Affair Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Path integral formulation

do you think that girls should wear make up i think that natural beauty is best and that make up is only worn because of the media and insecurities the media shows girls how they should look so they copy it am i crazy in thinking that the world would be better if no one wore make up and had to strive for unrealistic beaty or am i just some wacko who is going against the norm and should be corrected i've never been one to wear a lot of make up and i often receive compliments from both men and women because of it i feel that my face looks washed out w o any make up so usually i try to leave the house with a little eyeliner blush and eye shadow pretty lightly and lipstick just a couple of shades darker than my actual lip color many people think i don't wear any make up at all because it's so subtle but i think it's just a matter of personal taste a friend of a friend of mine i just don't understand how she applies her make up whenever i see her i'm always taken aback because she wears very bright eye shadow and her blush looks like she just puts big red spots on the sides of her face i mean it's her face to do what she wants but i can't understand how anyone looks at themselves in the mirror looking like a clown and thinks my face looks better like this than w o any make up at all but to each her own you know i just remember years ago on tv could have been on oprah that someone was giving make up tips and they said that your everyday make up should be unnoticeable meaning that it should only accentuate your natural features others shouldn't be noticing what colors you have on your face  Cosmetics Social rule Lipstick Theory of conduct Physical attractiveness The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Amber Spyglass Gender role Cliff Richard The Shining (film) Color theory Diamond Oprah Winfrey The Ashlee Simpson Show Friends Paul Is Dead Lucille Ball The Emancipation of Mimi Sunglasses Jon Secada K' Aesthetic Realism Humphrey Bogart Empire Burlesque Eye contact Cat coat genetics Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Drawing Time Out of Mind Clothing Unreal Marilyn Monroe The nature of God in Western theology Horse Koopa Kid Color Mario series enemies Negima Scenes from a Memory Eye color Socrates Spice Girls Britney Spears Philosophy of language Grace Cossington Smith Joker (comics) Barbie Ayumi Hamasaki Current teachings of Prem Rawat Angel One (TNG episode) Eye Spidey Super Stories Kylie Minogue Atomism Yu-Gi-Oh!

why don't men approach overweight women they do but not all men are as open minded as others unfortunately many men are shallow thinking and won't give women a chance to share their great sense of humor active lifestyle or great personality these men miss out on a great relationship because they are interested in someone who looks like thier favorite movie star well not everyone lives in hollywood i couldn't be stimulated by a size or that has no personality or soul or a sense of humor living a fuller life means opening yourself to others and touching their hearts not everyone has to fall in love but getting close to someone who is more huggable who is warmer and more meaningful is more sincere than waiting for paris hilton she is beautiful but has no soul or heart do you think she would scratch your back if it itched would she keep you warm on a cold night i doubt it look inside  Jon Secada One Tree Hill (TV series) Time Out of Mind Love Dead Like Me Phaedo Human sexual behavior Titanic (1997 film) Marilyn Monroe Sex and the City Social rule Obesity Tina Turner Saga (band) Mojave people Miss Saigon Past teachings of Prem Rawat Henry Fonda Hall & Oates Scenes from a Memory The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars Current teachings of Prem Rawat AFI 100 Years series Knots Landing Sinfest Audrey Hepburn Blood on the Tracks Human A Beautiful Mind Comedy film Happiness Cary Grant Sharon Tate The Inside Woody Allen Cole Porter Humphrey Bogart Lucille Ball Gay slang __tienne Bonnot de Condillac Nicomachean Ethics Philip J.

how do people ever become homeless i know it seems obvious but i just can't grasp how people ever get to the point of desparation in their life that they become homeless how does this happen especially here in our country where there is so much opportunity for upward growth i just don't understand i know several people who became homeless when their family kicked them out it often seems that once you begin that downward flight it becomes all too easy to end up that way in todays society with so many people living paycheck to paycheck or well beyond their means any sudden financial loss could very well put them on the street and once you're there it's hard to come back then there are those people who become consumed with an addiction and become uninterested in having to maintain a home because it interferes with their ability to feed their addiction then there are those who are mentally or physically disabled and have been ignored by the system or so mistreated by the system that they have no other option then of course there are those people who prefer it  Homelessness Microeconomics Health care in the United States Inflation Capitalism Unemployment Procrastination Equine conformation Mental retardation Poverty Hearing impairment Diseases of the honeybee Johnny PayCheck Wealth Asian financial crisis Social Security (United States) Addiction Sant Thakar Singh Weight training Hyperinflation Milton H.

isn't it hypocracy when women wear lowcut neckline and then complain that the men they talk to are always looking at their breasts psychologically speaking when women wear low cut dresses they are often doing it as a way of competing with other women and for their own gratification rather than attracting men therefore in their own minds it is not hypocrisy they have the right to wear what they like and still to be treated with respect however in general terms yes it is with this said under most circumstances in a court of law a woman's choice of attire is considered to be irrelevant if she receives unwarranted attention for example a man won't get very far if he claims that a woman was asking for it be it sex crude remarks or anything else by dressing sexily you also won't cut much with your boss principle the woman's boyfriend if you leer down her top and then say that she shouldn't have worn it so low  Gender role Skirt and dress French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Nudity Tzeniut Human sexual behavior Gay slang Rape Cross-dressing The Devil Wears Prada Sex Hijab Sexual orientation Clothing Suit (clothes) Little Britain The Handmaid's Tale Paraphilia Transgender Pedophilia The Smoking Room Sharia Social aspects of clothing George Costanza Hasidic Judaism Gender-neutral language Homosexuality and Christianity Abortion debate Goodness and value theory Androgen insensitivity syndrome Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Abortion Sexual harassment Same-sex marriage Kilt Laura Schlessinger Sinfest Sociolinguistics Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Black tie Transsexuality Aesthetic Realism Neuro-linguistic programming Sigmund Freud Social rule Hakama Medal of Honor Megan Griffin Great Teacher Onizuka Haredi Judaism Sadism and masochism Humphrey Bogart High-heeled shoe Beard Gay rights Undergarment Tennis Estoppel Salwar kameez Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bob Jones University Breast Friends Swimsuit Trousers Flapper Cowboy Drawn Together Deir Yassin massacre Viz (comic) Volleyball Kylie Minogue Domination & submission (BDSM) Have I Got News For You Halakha Sex and the City Japanese tea ceremony Bertrand Russell Pantyhose Domestic violence World Chess Championship Church of Christ Team Rocket Masturbation Anal sex Homosexuality in China Slander and libel The Shining (film) Yoko Ono Ex-gay Feminism The Championships, Wimbledon History of sex Avenue Q Child sexual abuse Women in Islam

why do some people think they deserve everything for doing nothing they are clueless to the fact that other people actually work hard for what they have i have seen a lot of this from college students i know not all college students are like this i am one for some reason these people think things should be handed to them there's an old e mail circulating about sharing your gpa the fact of the matter is that human nature is the most gain with the least effort that's why communism always fails people if given the chance will take a free ride my father hired a homeless man hoping to do him a favor a year later the formerly homeless man quit and came with a gun saying that my dad had ruined his life by giving him bills and responsibility when before life had been easy of course my dad walked up slowly and knocked the guy's lights out with a quick punch but that's another point entirely the point is that's an example of pandemic laziness and the willingness to have everyone bear your burdens but yourself  Altruism Theory of conduct Abortion debate Joe Louis Free will Grade (education) Social rule Pandemic Summa Theologiae Affirmative action 2000 Australian Grand Prix Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Intelligence quotient Esperanto as an international language SAT Sin City Justification (theology) Unemployment Wealth Education in Germany Divorce Knots Landing Microeconomics Corporate personhood Merit Babe Ruth H5N1 Sub-Zero Saruman Terminal ballistics Martial art Jon Secada Mnemonic Saved by the Bell Mary Wells Hitchhiking Sin Opus Dei Sant Thakar Singh Doraemon Sola fide EastEnders Unconditional Love American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Public transport W.

do you ever get sick of laws i know that law and order is supposed to help us get along with one another but do you ever think that someday we won't have any rights any more because of all the laws that are made abm well i was thinking about how everything is structured in society so that everyone is the same it is kind of annoying laws rules whatever it just seems like i pay a lot of tax money so that i can pay people to tell me what to do even if i don't agree with how it is being spent i don't have a choice i do my part by voting and paying attention to the political system i just find it a waste of time because it doesn't matter what i think someone else is going to make the decisions and then tell me that is what i have to do it just doen't make sense to me why can't our provinces just be self governed okay how about the gun registry program in canada estimated cost of the program billion that is right i said billion dollars dollars is it right that some farmer who has had his shot gun for years should now have to go and register it just so the government can make some extra cash and find out who has guns in their attic i agree that hand guns and semi automatic weapons should be registered because why do you need a handgun isn't there something that the citizens of canada could have their billion dollars worth of taxes find better uses for what is happening to our rights canada isn't a free country i pay plenty of money everyday and on every check and once a year just to live here i should be able to have more say in where my tax money is distributed and before stupid laws are put into place the citizens should have say in wheather or not the law is passed it shouldn't be voted on by senators sanators are appointed by the prime minister okay how about the

if you suddenly became an over night sensation how would it change you do you think you could take all the attention both welcome and otherwise without it going to your head would you maintain your current friendships or move away and start a new life would you try and use your income and influence to change the world or would you just pocket the cash and put your feet up by the swimming pool i know how we all love to celebrity bash sometimes but do you honestly think you could do any better and if so how i would move away but still keep all my old friends in fact i'd invite the best of them to come with me i would definitely use my income to help people i'd find little ways to help people on an individual level like meeting people who are down and out and asking them if they could do one thing to get their lives where they want it what would they do and if it's reasonable helping them to accomplish it i would help to house homeless families and leave really huge tips everywhere i go the attention would be hard to take paparazzi are ruthless sometimes and i love my privacy i don't really like to celebrity bash but when they do really dumb crap like hit a parked car in a parking lot and leave without talking to the other owner or leaving a note despite the fact that there's a dozen people photographing you doing it britney ever heard of hit and run that really is just laughable  Mojave people Shaggy dog story The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Donovan Britney Spears EastEnders Sant Thakar Singh Homelessness Carl G.

this is slightly random but why are barns typically shown as painted red is there a specific reason for the color red why not purple european farmers used to paint their barns with a mixture of linseed oil milk and lime which protected the wood sometimes they'd also add ferrous oxide also known as rust to the mix rust kills fungi and moss which grew on barns and trapped moisture in the wood which leads to decay painting a barn with rusty paint was the best way to keep it strong and dry after a while red barns became a tradition in europe and over here in america and even once commercial paints became available the tradition continued since red paint was cheap  Paint Tobacco Iron Rose Rust Stucco Pottery Corrosion Dairy Cochineal Plastic Sugar beet Explosive material Primer (paint) Tofu Tea Coffee Color theory Steel Wood Hydrochloric acid Shipwreck Light-emitting diode Color Sulfuric acid Carnivorous plant Breathing gas Orchidaceae Rice Lumber Fire extinguisher Gypsy moth Ultramarine Epoxy Lake Calcium hydroxide Moss Flax Carbon dioxide Stainless steel Peanut Cuisine of Brazil Wine Sugarcane Beer Plant Titanium Radium Mortar (masonry) Cheese Knife Food preservation Comanche Cosmetics Pickling Neil Young Plaster Glass Nuclear power Casting Hemp Tempera Sewage treatment Uranium Diseases of the honeybee Perfume Totem pole Soap Dairy farming E85 Oak Calcium Oil painting Vinegar Deforestation Rum Yoghurt Milk Lichen Fire Alberta Wheat Curry Barn Swallow Ammonia Terrazzo Comfrey Helium Linseed oil Leather Sugar Diving cylinder Soil pH Acrylic paint Plutonium Carburetor Pansy Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Alcohol fuel

how to exact revenge on an out of control zog prosecutor i just recently won a rather large lawsuit against the zog which arrested me and detained me for a period of nine months without bond on what has now been shown to have been a trumped up political charge see my other posts for additional information unfortunately this settlement will inevitably come out of the pockets of tax payers namely caucasians and not affect the african zog prosecutor or zog police officers who lied and fabricated evidence to detain me in violation of my constitutional rights in spite of their actions the animals are allowed to keep their jobs and their zog salaries which are taken from the tax money paid by caucasians for both personal reasons and so that these animals can never use the injustice system to attack another white person i intend to exact a measure of retribution against the zog in general and these individuals in particular unfortunately this is rather difficult considering how the prosecutor and its cronies in the zog police are africans thus any retribution i take against their offspring or the individuals they have produced these offspring with africans and other animals don t have spouses per see would have little effect in light of the fact that africans show no concern for such individuals and are known to use them as drug mules also were i to destroy their possessions as they have destroyed much of my property the zog would likely reimburse them and its well known that the only possessions africans truly care about are their porn booze and drugs and they seem to always be able to get more of that now i could cut out their intestines a procedure which is inevitably fatal but allows the victim to linger and suffer for up to four days as they fill with their own poisons unfortunately this procedure only results in four days of suffering whereas they illegally detained me for nine months while i might use this procedure as a final masterstroke i need to make these animals suffer for an additional eight months and twenty six days i was wondering if any of you might have any suggestions as to how i might go about this btw a portion of the award i received will be donated to organizations devoted to protecting the caucasian race and bringing down the zog good job  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Capital punishment Divorce Publicly funded medicine Rosa Parks Health insurance Tennessee State Constitution International Criminal Court Microeconomics Consensual crime Beltway sniper attacks Abortion debate Guantanamo Bay Appeal Zog of Albania Ernst Z__ndel Operation Murambatsvina Democracy Article One of the United States Constitution Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution Affirmative action War on Terrorism George W.

would you defend someones rights beliefs even if they are not your own it's funny but i thought that as americans we are suppose to do this very act and on a regular basis i'm certain that many of you will initially think yeah i do that all the time but i bet you're not telling the truth the reason i ask such a question is because of responses i've gotten on this forum i've asked and commented upon people's rights to chose if they can do drugs and then have been called a drug user myself i am not one i have stated that homosexuals should have rights and then have been called gay which i am not with that logic if i believe in civil rights then i must be black here i must be crazy but i was thinking that we are suppose to emulate such people who do exactly what i am trying to do i thought we are suppose to revere characters like atticus finch from to kill a mockingbird and george bailey of it's a wonderful life are they not our rolemodels but i must be mistaken it's sad isn't it frustrating and hope stealing whether it's an idea portrayed in america or not it's an idea that is positive and should be acted out and upon more frequently than not we've become a billion individual voices instead of a billion voices together equality is no longer an issue but self proclomation is now a goal in general the idea isn't to live and let live but to persuade and or con to believe my way i believe in choice so long as it does not imminently affect lives or a life of another as an example if bob is gay it does not pose a life threat on anyone or myself if mary is catholic it does not pose a life threat on anyone or myself that is her life this is mine i don't stand up for someone's religion becuase i believe it but i stand up for it becuase i believe that that person has free right to believe in what religion they choose to without descrimination i won't go into detail about drug use becuase there are many negative factors to consider to wrap it up you're absolutely right as a people what are we doing we don't expand our minds beyond our own hands feet and satisfaction  Theory of conduct Same-sex marriage in Canada Libertarianism Sexual orientation Coercion Homosexuality and Christianity Ethics Abortion debate Homophobia Objectivist philosophy Civil rights Federal Marriage Amendment Theodicy Plame affair Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Religion Free will Peter Singer The nature of God in Western theology Internet troll Religious conversion Polyamory Social rule Liberalism Little Britain Bayesian inference Scientology beliefs and practices David Hume Predestination Determinism Property (ownership right) Friedrich Schleiermacher U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Constitution of Ireland Roman Catholic Church Same-sex marriage Social psychology Summa Theologiae Microeconomics Bill O'Reilly (commentator) Estoppel Rush Limbaugh Rick Santorum Meaning of life Causality Biology and sexual orientation The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Humphrey Bogart Simone Weil Conservatism She Loves You Infantilism Reality Whose Line Is It Anyway? 2004 Republican National Convention Lawrence v.

why do people do porn i understand that we all have a sex drive but why do some people make a career living out of it isn't it dangerous at the very least it's sleazy but you're also getting your name out there in all the wrong ways glamourizing sex and making a living off of other people masturbating to you which only further brings morals down lower than they have been i mean sex is good but these people do it to the extreme i guess there's a huge market for it and its all about money but isn't this industry basically evil right down to its core people being shallow glamourizing beauty bodies looks cock sizes breast sizes and objectifying everyone in them it's all about fantasy and i can understand that but sometimes fantasies should stay fantasies a normal person gets sexually aroused from time to time takes care of his needs and moves on to his job or life these people's lives are this doesn't this take horniness and human perversion to another level tho porn industry is an industry of nearly billion dollar per year income that certainly explains the tension of the age we are living as far as i know it isn't a particularly dangerous industry as everything is handled in typical ways model negotiations shooting of scenes payment and must be in no way be thought of as equal to prostitution certain fantasies should always remain fantasies you say well we live in a free world and for the better or for the worse freedom of speech and thought is encouraged my opinion on this is that freedom is a wonderful thing as long as it's not abused but that i guess stands for everything if even the purest thing in the world is abused the concequences will be severe  Human sexual behavior Pornography Theory of conduct Zoophilia Infantilism Child pornography Sexual orientation Pornographic movie Hentai Prostate cancer Simone Weil Avenue Q Capital accumulation Inflation Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Paraphilia Child sexuality Prostitution Abortion debate Bondage (BDSM) Economics Scientology beliefs and practices Pornography in Japan Theodicy Sex-positive feminism Microeconomics Pedophilia Prostitution in Germany Religion and sexuality Polyamory Rape Alignment (role-playing games) Anorexia nervosa Oral sex Brave New World Masturbation BDSM John Holmes (actor) Phone sex Motion picture rating system Evil Insurance Sex and the City Socrates Sexual addiction Sexual attraction Economic inequality Law of value Pitaten John Howard Yoder Video game controversy MMORPG Gender role Arguments for and against drug prohibition Nicomachean Ethics Free trade Software engineering Galactic Civilizations Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Kodocha Childlove movement Goodness and value theory Gross domestic product Brian Griffin The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Libertarianism Jam (TV series) Strap-on dildo Sex toy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Homophobia Sexual arousal Breast Taxi Driver Dead Like Me W.

i hate you everyone is racist in some way we all have something that we dont like we are taught hate from the moment we come out of the womb the difference is when we use that hate to be hurtful rather than to inspire us to do something good and useful why is there so much hate on the internet all of these people of different hertiages on here making fun of and hurting others for what purpose for example i am white and american and a woman everday at work i see all kinds of different people yet the worst customers i get are business white people so whats the point of stereotyping different races if the stereotypes arent right you are very right human beings have been very fond of stereotyping people and this is the very reason why stigmas have been very successfull in gaining ground in people's minds the individual has never been given a chance or if they are then you'll hear statements like oh you are not like the rest of them and things of that kind it's very very sad that we for a long time now have chosen to operate in this manner  Racism Abortion debate Mojave people Urantia Human sexual behavior Soul The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex White trash Atomic Kitten Social rule Simone Weil Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Value system Stoicism Nigger Advertising Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Lie Summa Theologiae Autism rights movement Homophobia Jews as a chosen people Teen Girl Squad Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Ty Cobb Aristotle Ferengi Black (people) Alignment (role-playing games) Media and ethnicity Avenue Q Propaganda Uncle Tom's Cabin Das Lied von der Erde Joke Anti-Defamation League Revolutionary Girl Utena Paradox Theory of conduct Pitaten Scanger Human nature Human Have I Got News For You Tae eul ju Martin Heidegger John Wycliffe Gender role Goodness and value theory The nature of God in Western theology Ernst Z__ndel Emotion Human sexuality Leviathan (book) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Asian fetish Hate speech Clown Niddah The Human Stain Alcoholics Anonymous Utilitarianism Sinfest Roger Ebert's most hated films Gerund Karl Marx Male prostitute Angel Sant Thakar Singh Exorcism Original sin Infantilism Philo British National Party Ten Commandments Brian Close Nine Inch Nails Autism David Hume Germaine Greer Sola fide Validity of human races Model minority Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Predestination Time Out of Mind Pioneer Fund Race and intelligence Minstrel show Hearing impairment Heaven Force (Star Wars) Undergrads John Howard Yoder Moral objectivism Stereotype Zoophilia H.P.

a question about people human nature i've noticed just be studying people how people will divide themselves with certain people like all the latino guys girls with all hang out with the latinos allt he black guys girls are all in one group as well now it doesn't mean that they are racist because they like everyone but some how all the latinos will be on one side and all the blacks will be on one side i wonder why is human nature like that in people this is at my school places like that the something goes with other things like all the cute girls hang with the cute girls and the ones in the middle hang with the ones in the middle sorry y'all if i don't make no sense at all but i have a hard time trying to type questions to make it were people get what i'm trying to say o my gosh i'm so sorry that i have made several mistakes in my question but it wouldn't let me go back and edited it please leave nice answers please thanks don't worry about the mistakes it happens to us all as for the group thing yeah i've noticed that it happens a lot in some cases it might be some sort of prejudice but in most cases i think it's more like people like to hang out with others who come from the same background or have the same interests some are connected through association through their families and become friends that way i also think that it's easier to belong to a group that you can identify with instead of being the odd one out in a group you might get along with but that may never understand things totally from your perspective no matter how nice they are or how much they try to understand its little things mostly like if one person wants to just chit chat about an awesome dinner he had he doesn't want to have to explain what he's talking about such as a shwarma might have misspelled that a shwarma is a really great middle eastern sandwich type thing if person a wanted to tell his friend person b where he could get a really tasty shwarma he doesn't want to have to first explain what a shwarma is it is aggravating to have to explain everything before a person conveys the intended message and it can feel a lot like defending yourself and or your culture however if person a and person b were of the same cultural background he could just say hey man go to ali's they have great shwarma and that part of the conversation would be over and done with person b understanding totally what was being talked about with no further explanation i don't think its really anything wrong going on just being with others of your own culture is more comfortable and feels more secure it's usually easier for people to relate to others who have a similar background that's all anyway my opinion only but how i see it  Theory of conduct Social rule Plame affair Philosophy of language Friends Time Out of Mind Humphrey Bogart Sexual orientation Black (people) Theodicy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Infantilism Little Britain Meaning of life Social psychology The nature of God in Western theology Hiberno-English Avenue Q Extreme Programming Transactional analysis Goodness and value theory Free will Nicomachean Ethics Religion Transsexuality Blood on the Tracks Ethics Philosophical skepticism The Lovely Bones Intelligent design Creationism Deconstruction Internet troll Supernatural Cult Guns, Germs, and Steel Meaning Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Brian Griffin A Course In Miracles Evolutionary creationism Kodocha Scientific method God Emperor of Dune Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Causality Extras (sitcom) Dualism (philosophy of mind) Patriotism EastEnders Shaggy dog story Ludwig Wittgenstein Noam Chomsky Prostate cancer Science K' Donald Davidson (philosopher) Identity and change Epistemology Moral Politics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Socrates Discordianism The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Abduction Phenomenon Infant baptism Philosophy of mathematics John Wycliffe Opus Dei Hey Arnold!

why is animal cruelty acceptable to so many why is it if you say you love animals and are against cruelty so many people label you a fanatic i am not a peta member i don't like peta at all i don't think animals are better than people but why the hell do people think because they are better and smarter that gives us the right to be cruel isn't that the very notion of irony that we the more intelligent species with higher level emotions such as empathy and being humane choose not to and throw it off by saying well we're just better and smarter god put animals here for us to use i truly don't understand this i'm not talking aobut eating animals which i don't have a problem with or using leather etc i'm talking about killing animals in a way for these things that's unnecessarily drawn out and cruel or just hurting killing an animal simply for shits and giggles i will agree with the below posters that a human life is worth more than an animals' life but since we're giving ourselves the right to kill animals we are responsible for providing a very good rationale for killing the animals and killing them humanely conducting animal testing only for medical purposes treating wild animals with respect and if we choose to keep an animal as a pet treating that pet as part of our family we need animals to better our lives in various ways so in return they must be treated in a serious and considerate manner  Animal rights Kashrut Speciesism Theory of conduct Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Theodicy Animal testing Meaning of life Zoophilia Veganism Empathy Goodness and value theory Fox hunting Whaling Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Cruelty to animals Peter Singer Objectivist philosophy Shit Evil Alcoholics Anonymous Human The Amber Spyglass God Emperor of Dune Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Wealth Vegetarianism Treecat John Howard Yoder Polyamory Hell Vulcan (Star Trek) Summa Theologiae Social psychology Dog Anorexia nervosa Abortion debate Religion The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Huntingdon Life Sciences Animism Simone Weil Person Epistemology Value system Afterlife Judas Priest Dilbert Punk ideology Altruism Procrastination Animal welfare Consciousness Ontological argument Shaggy dog story Dialectic Human sexual behavior Intelligence (trait) Hunting Presuppositional apologetics Taboo food and drink Themes in Blade Runner Emotional intelligence Social rule Humphrey Bogart Euphemism Barry Horne Therianthropy Happiness LaVeyan Satanism Sheikh Abdullah Reincarnation Noahide Laws Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pitaten Bernard Williams 613 mitzvot Motivation Problem of Hell Sinfest Sexual orientation Hamster Soul Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses The Death Gate Cycle Karma in Hinduism EastEnders The nature of God in Western theology Past teachings of Prem Rawat Sant Thakar Singh S__ren Kierkegaard Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Cat Creationism Biodiversity Domestic rabbit

why do well off successful people get hated on i've witnessed this in other successful well off people and in myself i'm not successful yet in the work sense but i'm pretty well off happy and like to dress well and i like fashion so when i go out in public i do like to wear current clothing etc what i noticed are a few things some retail workers would roll their eyes and just look frustrated or sigh upon me entering their store and be more rude mean to me at the checkout counter i'd get dirty looks or whatever types of gestures by other people as they walk by me at a public place such as a mall this is a funny one if i'm driving parallel to someone sometimes that person upon making eye contact with me gives me a dirty look and veers to the lane next to them i get my car purposefully vandalized among other things i mean i just like to go out there and be the best person i can be in all ways and people don't seem to like that they hate on it why also taking the focus away from myself other people that are really successful and i don't mean just celebrities get hated on constantly and put down don't those haters realize that it takes alot of hard work constant motivation craftiness and skill just to be able to do what these successful people do daily also if they look well made up it takes money good taste and well many things why dismiss things that obviously deserve respect not everyone has success thrown into them it's funny because you can spend your whole life trying to succeed and once you do more people may hate on you than before and you could find yourself with less friends and a more miserable life if you're on the bottom people call you a loser if you're towards the top it's not any easier socially human beings suck oh so it's snobbish to try to be well off successful and dress well well excuse me for not dressing in sweats pigging out at mcdonalds and being down on my luck forgive me maybe i'll try to be a follower and fit in with everyone else rather than be proud of myself i didn't ask for a judgement i asked for a response anyways hopefully your response keeps getting the thumbs down and eventually i can report it as spam d have a wonderful day dear people dont have respect for anyone any more that is jus the way it is if they had any class at all they would treat everyone like they were worth millions no one ever knew my i q or my talents and abilities because i always treated everyone with such high respect i admire people who are self made people just get jealous because you represent the person they wanted to be and couldn't because they didnt try or don' know how you be who you are and god bless  Shaggy dog story Beavis and Butt-head Social rule EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity The Apprentice 2 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct Piccolo Junior Saga Good Morning, Vietnam One Tree Hill (TV series) W.I.T.C.H.

why do some people think that its impossible to have a neutral opinion on the topic of abortion my grandmother asked me what i though about it which was weird but anyway i told her what i tell everyone abortion really isnt any of my bussiness i personally could only think of maybe cirumstances where i would consider getting one but i dont knock those who do for more then my reasons and she told me that was b s i have gotten this response from people on this website as well why because people are pretty passionate about the subject on both sides of it but i can see where you are coming from i am pro choice but would not choose to have one myself i had my son when i was but i didn't judge the girls in my school even after i had my son who chose abortion i think it is a personal choice for each woman and i think you are entitled to your view don't worry about what the radicals say on either side of the subject  Pro-choice Abortion Abortion debate Sexual orientation Abortion in Canada Partial-birth abortion Roe v.

why must america change it how comes everytime something british goes over to america it's changed for example harry potter and the philsopher's stone telly tubbies the office etc etc they completely changed the cast of the office for american actors and changed the storyline so that it's 'relvant' to americans' it's not the office then if it's a different cast i watch american programs all the time and i can get the drift of the time to their references why cant it stay as it is is it that hard to understang what's happening accents then why don't they change tv over here for us it took me ages to work out who martha stewart though i am still unsure i think she's some sort of jail bird who was once a homemakerish type person is and i often hear references that go straight over my head telly tubbies was supposedly dubbed and they got rid of the narrator man harry potter became harry potter and the sorceror's stone i would give better examples but i have not been to america to experience the joy of cable tv millions of people over here and the world watch american movies and comedies and dramas and read the books don't you as a american find it offesive that who ever is in charge thinks you're too thick to understand what's going on so have to spell it out to you for example i and us british understand the program friends though their lifestyle and goals is different from my lifestyle or sex and the city when they were going on about foreskin over here that's the norm but they made a big deal about it yet i got what was happening in the case of the office the style of humor may have something to do with it it's all about viewership and ratings they didn't just change it they revised and familiarized it and tested it b mass producing also our tv ratings guidelines don't allow certain dry humor which the brits are famous for i haven't watched british tv in years but using the old stand bys of benny hill and monty python you get away with a lot more than we ever could lol god i miss those shows  EastEnders Sesame Street Humphrey Bogart Desperate Housewives Queer as Folk (U.S.) Comedy film Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) John Cleese Ron Weasley Monty Python's Flying Circus Ron and Fez One Tree Hill (TV series) Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Television in the United States Monty Python I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again Theory of conduct Harry Potter Whose Line Is It Anyway?

do people in the middle east wipe their rears with hands i heard a myth or fact that people in the middle eastern countries don't use toilet paper to wipe their behinds they use their left hand is this true or not i'm just asking don't go off the deep end i'm talking about in modern times ty yes muslims attribute the practice to the prophet who according to tradition commanded people to eat with their right hands and forbade them to eat with their left hands he said 'the shaytaan a devil eats with his left hand and drinks with his left hand ' i realize the subject here is eating but obviously we're dealing with a binary division of labor here whatever the shaytaan may or may not do the right hand surely is favored for the less noisome tasks because that's the one most people favor for everything worse luck for those of us who don't  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct Original sin Toilet paper Eastern Orthodox Church Book of Isaiah The nature of God in Western theology Christianity Apostasy in Islam Operation Market Garden Peleliu 613 mitzvot Taboo food and drink Mary, the mother of Jesus Magic (paranormal) Idolatry Ten Commandments Satanism Salah The Death Gate Cycle Religion Criticism of Islam Religious conversion State Customs and etiquette of Japan Binary numeral system Jizya Buddhism Eucharist Dhimmi Theodicy Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Islamic philosophy Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Saint Deconstruction Aisha Ramadan Discrimination Oakland Athletics Shaggy dog story Two Treatises of Government Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Fasting Women in Islam Social rule Milton H.

could you please give me your honest opinion about this question at this mental facility a consumer patient attacked a man hurting him really really bad he had fractures to the head and face all together the man that got attacked was in nursing there was a man and a woman in a different department that yelled for people when this consumer attacked the man the two workers said they didn't try to stop it while this man was getting a beating because they didn't want to get hurt themselves they were afraid of losing their jobs and they were not in the same department as the man getting beat up this work place is bad about firing people if you interfere with matters that don't pertain to you especially when it comes to the consumers it seems like the system is on their side no matter what the two worker's that witnessed the attack was a man and a woman and now half of the building won't talk to them and they blamed the man more than the woman because he is a man and should have stepped in what do you think sorry this is so long but i had to explain thoroughly for you to understand what happened and give an honest opinion honestly the right thing to say was the should've jumped in and helped but until you're actually in the situation you can't really judge but i'm going to try i can see if they feared for their lives yes it's good they called for help but fearing for their jobs seems a little selfish to me but then again who am i to talk maybe if i was in their situation my actions might suprise me how severe was this man's mental illness was he coherent enough to be held accountable if not i can see how they couldn't hurt him in a perfect world they should have helped and honestly i don't think fear of losing a job is a good enough excuse when someone is getting very hurt however fearing for your life might impede your interference and that's just a natural instinct so i guess they can't be given too much blame if fearing for their own lives was the reason they didn't help they did call for help however if they were only looking out for their jobs maybe they do deserve blame i'm sorry i just don't think there's a total right answer here  Theory of conduct Simone Weil Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Transactional analysis Free will Merit Rich Mullins Insanity defense Sydney Riot of 1879 Theodicy Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Goodness and value theory The Apprentice 2 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina The nature of God in Western theology Social rule Nicomachean Ethics Scientology beliefs and practices Milton H.

what is the ultimate revenge if you had just one chance to get revenge on that person you despise what would it be can you think of the perfect revenge plot and why do you feel that this is the ultimate revenge to let them think you are going to get even and when they have completely forgotten they did anything then get them but sometimes the thinking that your going to get them and keeping them guessing is payment enough case and point my mom had this friend that made a special cupcake for my mom where she took the top off of it and filled it with green beans and covered it back up and frosted it this friend waited knowing my mom was going to get even for a good months or so when my mom decided to make a batch of cupcakes and filled them with frosting and topped it with more frosting this friend knowing what she did to the previous cupcake tore that cupcake up thinking that there was something grose in it and when she only found frosting she proclaimed that she ruined a perfectly good cupcake so sometimes the best revenge is nothing at all  Knots Landing Kodocha Shaggy dog story Pitaten Satchel Paige Castlevania: Lament of Innocence Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog One Tree Hill (TV series) W.I.T.C.H.

why is it that everytime a person is multiracial mixed with even just a little bit of black they are always considered to be just black e g halle berry is considered to be a black woman alicia keys is too kimora lee simmons tiger woods other mulitracial celebrities i've heard some pple categorize mariah carey as black too cause she has like black in her or something what that's nuts i always thought alicia keys had some asian blood in her and mariah carey doesn't look african american to me i guess maybe it's because of the genes i learned two years ago in my bio course that if you mix black and white person for example the child may come out white however these are very low possibilities because black gene is much stronger than the white one but even if the child comes out white he she still has the black gene in them only this gene is hidden because of this there is a high possibility that next generation will be black even if both parents are light colored so basically once you get the black gene it's really hard to get rid of it unlike white gene which could be lost with just one mix i always think of it as making a painting you start out with the white piece of paper then you take your black color pencil and color the entire surface with black color pencil now try applying white color pencil over no matter how hard you try to make your paper white like it was before it will never be the same and even if you do succeed in making the paper completely white it will still have black underneath it this is not applied to only white color but any other color as well so if you mix black with any other color black will always win because of its nature maybe this is the reason why these celebrities are considered black i personally believe that skin color doesn't mean anything what is the difference if hally berry is black or half black half white or if mariah is white or black what does black and white mean anyway i believe that person is chinese because he she comes from china and follows its traditions it's not about color it's about culture people grow up differently because of their surroundings their religion their language and their influences i think it's great that there is such diversity on this plannet even though sometimes we disagree about life and the way the world should be run like muslims and westerners disagree now can you imagine what would world be like if there was only one color one religion and one opinion some might say that it would be perfect place to live in but i don't think so maybe in the begining it would be fun but eventually it would get borring people need to be different so they could learn from their differences i hope i didn't bore you with this i just wanted to tell someone the way i felt about this specific topic that i never got chance to discuss before  White (people) Human skin color Theory of conduct Black (people) African American The Emancipation of Mimi We Belong Together Emotions (album) Mariah Carey (album) Traditional animation Color Nature versus nurture Honey (Mariah Carey song) Pottery Sexual orientation Single certification Turkic peoples Billboard Hot 100 Ontological argument Color theory Hip hop collaborations Black Whose Line Is It Anyway?

why does it feel better if someone else scratches you than if you scratch yourself it's always nicer for someone else to scratch you or brush your hair etc it comes from when we were ape like primates in the way distant past have you ever seen apes grooming each other it's necessary for apes to groom each other because an ape can't reach all of his or her own body so nature made it pleasant to sit still and enjoy being groomed it releases chemicals endorphins and oxytocin in the brain that relax you which doesn't happen if you do it yourself it also makes you feel closer to the person who is touching you it's a kind of social bonding if someone scratches your back you feel more affectionate towards them and you feel that they care about you thanks to those nice chemicals in your brain this all helps to keep families and couples together it's also what makes kitties purr when you pet them endorphins are nice  Primate Cat Guinea pig Drug addiction Human Endorphin Mountain Gorilla Sadism and masochism Aquatic ape hypothesis Addiction Dualism (philosophy of mind) Brush Motivation Empathy Orgasm Oxytocin Dog BDSM The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Zoophilia Clinical depression Oral sex Breastfeeding Sense Planet of the Apes Neurotransmitter W.I.T.C.H.

why are parents creating an entitlement generation of spoiled self indulged brats hi this question goes only to people past age what do you think of the new entitlement generation term for teens youth of today i have many teenage realatives and it sickens me to see all these young teenagers lavished by their parents with brand new cars i pods cell phones and everything else parents foot the bill for everything and these kids act like money grows on trees why do parents today think that parenting means being a friend and giving kids all these material things they havent worked day for kids probably think they should be paid just for getting dressed in the morning thats not how the real world is whats the deal discuss i find it frightening to be honest mine grew up with a very clear sometimes too clear realisation of just how much money i did or did not have to this day i could sob at a few of the discussion we would have before going to the supermarket about please do not ask for anything outside of what i put in the basket but on a brighter side my kids now have a work ethic like you would not beleive they have seen me do jobs that they know i hate just to bring in some extra money and they also know that what they did get was freely given and with all my love and whilst they might not have got everything they wanted they did not go without i also taught mine that i am not their friend never have been never will be but i am their mother and will hold that title for ever and as such will love them forever also as they have grown up they have seen experienced friends stabbing them in the back falling by the wayside when things got tough etc now that things are much better money wise for us we can all still recall those days and have no intention of going back to them and both of them work hard enjoy their lvies but save pay them self first etc very hard as well they also know that before anything else happens bills etc must be paid the parents that give everything and then some are truly not doing their kids any favours as this lifestyle will be expected to be maintained throughout their adult lvies and can see a whole generation coming unstuck at the first sign of a problem due to lack of money as they will always live far beyond their means at the school i taught in there was a reward system and i was instructed to reward this certain child for coming to school with a pen and a book all but lost my job when i refused the gournds of my argument was that if he ever got off his butt to get a job no employer was going to reward him for showing up on time with his unform on apart from getting a pay check at the end of the week and basically was told that we must fulfill their sense of self worth yeah right get right on that not regards ok stepping away from the key board lol lol  One Tree Hill (TV series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Quarashi Poker jargon Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution EastEnders Pitaten Saved by the Bell Kill Bill Contract The Contender (television series) The Fairly OddParents Boston Public Kodocha The Catcher in the Rye Education in the People's Republic of China Friends Vegeta Insurance Shaggy dog story Money Hikikomori Microeconomics Education Theory of conduct Freeters Avenue Q About a Boy Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Summa Theologiae Scientology beliefs and practices Motion picture rating system The Amber Spyglass Humphrey Bogart Captain Marvel (DC Comics) Obi-Wan Kenobi Great Teacher Onizuka Tupac Shakur RuneScape quests W.I.T.C.H.

why do people drive so fast when the light is red up ahead i can understand the thought process of a person trying to get through a green light before it changes but why do people floor it like ish in a mph zone when traffic is stopped ahead the light is going to be red for at least the next seconds so why do people weave in and out of traffic and try to get ahead of each other when everyone is going to end up at the same place anyways would you be wasting gas by constantly doing this i live in california yes that is wasting gas acceleartaing and slowing repeatedly does just that the purpose for this is to get ahead of the traffic they are trying to beat the odds that their path will remain open and they will get ahead of others it is also a move for attention seekers thrill seekers power seekers and morons it is dangerous even getting ahead by a couple cars is considered a victory by them i consider it to be a temporary victory against death who will inevitably will catch up with the person doing this and unfortunately to everyone near him my personal favorite is the moron who weaves in and out of traffic succeeds in getting ahead and then i pass him later down the highway he has slowed up because he is now on the cell phone and you guessed it a few minutes later he flies by the same people again thus putting them in harm's way again and no we do not all end up in the same place he will be going somewhere very hot and meet someone holding a red pitchfork for killing people lol i know what you are asking yes and for some reason getting there second before the rest of us do is important to these people  Traffic light Toyota Prius Drag racing Interstate Highway Formula One regulations Tag Railway signalling Vehicular cycling 2000 Australian Grand Prix Speed limit Daylight saving time Spider Fast bowling Poker jargon Dog agility Warning sign Rules of the road Transportation of Los Angeles Road safety Hurricane Rita TGV Rescue of Giuliana Sgrena Freeway National Football League Lore Bike lane debate Road traffic accident Airport Team Fortress Classic Billboard (advertising) 24 Hours of Le Mans USS Tunny (SS-282) Traffic sign Fuel efficiency Renewable energy Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Past teachings of Prem Rawat Internal ballistics Nuclear power The Contender (television series) Hybrid vehicle Tenshinhan Gekisou Sentai CarRanger Tour de France Fire fighting Automobile 2005 European Grand Prix Ben Johnson (athlete) U.S. Highway 66 Light rail Motorway Sun Ravi Shastri Interchange (road) Action potential Jet engine Welding Elis Prefecture Autoroute Grand Theft Auto (game) Kitchen Radioactive waste Autobahn Volleyball Lane Knots Landing Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Collectibles in Bionicle 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Entropy Jiddu Krishnamurti Stop sign The Suffering (game) Level crossing Zeno's paradoxes Glossary of partner dance terms Thief (computer game) Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Ayrton Senna Chris Amon Hiawatha Line Road-rule enforcement camera G-Man (Half-Life) 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Swingout 2005 Iditarod Automatic number plate recognition Blood (computer game) Iditarod Public transport CPU cache 2003 North America blackout Drunk driving (United States) Highway Aerial (dance move) Hydrogen economy Internal combustion engine

started this job years ago i try to be social but i try or tried to be social show intrests in co workers life i almost feel bad no one really comes up to chit chat with me i see someone look right over me to talk to the person next to me i am not that social or i don't know how to be and some times this bugs me i have esteem and i'm not worried if i'll say something stupid i don't feel like i'm better then them i don't know i confuse myself when i think about it but i guess what i should ask is how can i be more social i was more of the loner type growing up walked around the schools instead of hanging out with peeps in the lunch room and now i see the trend i go out alone for lunch as it is some times rare i go out on a lunch date if there is work or i get the invite i haven't asked anyone to go to lunch well i have i take that back but not much at all i'm not sad about it just wondering you do have your self esteem and that is all tht matters now perhaps you need to work with yourself on how you ''approach'' pple i am not definitely saying you are not but perhaps there is something of the ''loner'' that you grew up with that you keep associating yourself with you feel a bit unsure if your approach is right or wrong you are absolutely fine no disorders all you need is that you need to adapt that when you work its a team around you for starters i would suggest you watch who is who as in get to know your co workers first silently know what they like where they lunch or what they do their families and see how they interact with each other slowly blend in yourself like a ''curry'' lol just kidding it takes time thats all you are not sad because you know you can blend in and tht you are really smart and talented its only ''how'' that matters as of now once you finish your watching session see who is the closest you can approach perhaps the one who sits next to your cabin or next to you and then you slowly after understanding him or her you slowly blend in with him or her by saying ''hey i think u'd really like this '' or anything it could be the simplest of a hello to asking him or her '''wowww i like that too so did u do watch read say anything since you are not sad about the whole situation i assume you are definitely not a ''people pleaser'' and you shud not be no way you are you you are doing fine and you just need to transform yourself from a ''loner'' to a ''social person'' thats all do it slowly no need to people please or panic or rush and you will see that the first person you become freindly with will end up with a network of co workers becoming slowly into your team of freinds start one day a time as i said again one person at a time not all the pple all the time take the first step forward like i told you the next person in ur cabin or sitting next to you make something or cook something or a great place to go out and invite ''''do you like this i just tried it myself and i am not a big fan of my own cooking wanna share my lunch or whatever ''' and you laugh over yourself and there it goes a bit and only a ''bit'' of laughing over yourself doesnt matter at all just sound like you are a really fun person which u are iam sure but just let it out good luck its only the transformation thatyou need as of now which i am sure youwill  Social rule Milton H.

why do women think they are always right in an argument anyone in an argument thinks he's she's right think about it you wouldn't be arguing if you knew you were wrong you should ask a different question why do women think they can never be wrong ahh grasshopper such questions you ask argument isn't always about right and wrong sometimes it's about persuasion and that's not always accomplished by factual analysis in a persuasive transaction someone wins and someone loses a woman has more of an emotional investment in losing than a man she fears being seen as weaker because she fears she is weaker all this crap you hear about men really being the weaker sex is just that that's just a lot of whistling in the dark men are susceptible to being persuaded simply because our egos can handle it better than theirs we capitulate first because we can't handle the tears threats and hystrionics to which those of frail self esteem need to resort in order to prevail  Abortion debate Ontological argument Theory of conduct Gorgias Philosophical skepticism Turing test Bernard Williams Consensus decision-making Sigmund Freud Keynesian economics Fallacy Simone Weil Friends Peter Singer Apology (Plato) Mind control Force (Star Wars) Appeal G__del's incompleteness theorem Ad hominem Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Human sexual behavior Begging the question Liberalism Anarchism and capitalism Social rule Mary Wollstonecraft Theodicy Homophobia Humphrey Bogart Presuppositional apologetics Free trade Psychology Deprogramming Combat stress reaction Epistemology Romulus and Remus Resurrection of Jesus David Hume Socrates Propaganda Eugenics Craps Gender-neutral language Controversies in autism Plame affair Philosophy of language Phaedo Polygamy Fathers' rights Human God Emperor of Dune Marriage Brainwashing 2004 Republican National Convention Qualia Cicero Halting problem Friendly Persuasion (1956 film) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Darwin from Descent of Man to Emotions Discordianism Transsexuality Moral relativism Transcendental argument for the existence of God Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Logical argument The Amber Spyglass The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Advertising Shaggy dog story Slippery slope Rhetoric Meaning of life Iago Atheism Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Contract Agnosticism Assassination Coming of Age (TNG episode) Palpatine Equal Protection Clause Cult Nuclear warfare Lawrence v.

this is supposed to be funny what kind of a society do we live in where comics like this win awards i'm new to the world of mp players and podcasts since i gave my daughter an mp player for her birthday i heard about a website for the podcast awards and decided to check it out i followed one of the links for one of the people's choice candidates a comedy podcast called keith and the girl the animated sample podcast was an absolutely disgusting skit mocking and ridiculing kids with mental disabilities at some imaginary benefit for a home i stopped watching after about a minute and my blood is still boiling these kind of lowlifes make me absolutely sick i guess if you can't be funny you just have to be idiotically insensitive and crude oh how clever of them to push the boundaries of bad taste way to cater the worst in people for every person out there who tries to set a positive example for the young and impressionable there's idiot parasites like this exploiting and promoting the worst in them continued what is wrong with a society that not only produces this garbage but also that receive popular support as the peoples choice all of the hard work done by wonderful and compassionate people to undo the stigma is so easily and thoughtlessly undone by this kind of cruelty i feel dirty just having been briefly exposed to this thanks for listening to my rant looking forward to hearing your responses p s i have another daughter who is mentally disabled so this is not just about me sheltering my older daughter i haven't seen this bit i haven't heard of it either but that doesn't mean much i guess that my answer to that would be that as of late there really is no original bit of anything pretty much everything has been done and now the only thing left is to explore uncharted frontiers and to make fun of those with disabilities it's sad and flawed but it is the reality in which we live if you just poke around online and read some people's answers to questions you will see that a lot of people's first response to anything that they do not understand is to simply ridicule it s the easiest way out and in some forums the easiest way to get a laugh it s very easy for someone lacking a conscience to obtain laughs and or approval from a vacant insipid audience the content fits the audience and one can only hope that the audience is a small one  Theory of conduct I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Social rule Joke Late Night with Conan O'Brien Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.

masculine or feminine features on a man personally i've always liked boys to be a touch on the feminine side as far as appearances go long hair slightly more delicate features i've never liked the rugged square jawed hairy overly muscled men apparently i'm not alone http news yahoo com s nm sc nm masculinity face dc my question is what's your opinion iyertcs i don't think its disgusting when men look like women at all i'm bisexual how ever so that is probably why men who look like women do not bother me girly girl i love a little bit of hair on the chest but too much grosses me out salknows we would most certainly not get along my friend at least not in a relationship i am rough and tumble i played football i worked out in the gym with the other players i open my own doors and push in my own seat i even open my own jars change my own lightbulbs and even fix my own car how ever almost every one is usefull and that should not be decided on by gender men are just as usefull as women and women are just as useful as men but to each there own i am sure there are plenty of women out there who would lov ea guy like you belladonna i personally do not prefer the largely muscular men or men who seem to exhibit over the top levels of testosterone its is not necessarily needed to produce children protect or provide for a family when was the last time you saw a body builder working in a high rise office making usd a year personally i never have but that's just me while men cannot get pregnant they can breast feed i watched a documentary about it they have all the equipment necessary to produce milk i am into both men and women and i do prefer feminine men it is not nonsense it is just my preference i like them to be a bit muscled but sleek muscle muscle you know is there but isn't protruding in all directions i have every strength a man has and the men i work with would tell you so i am a female and i work in construction of course men on the more feminine side is not for every one but neither are highly masculine men i did not try to tell you all women prefer feminine men so please do not try to tell me that all women like masculine men i thought this study interesting because i am not the only person i know who likes masculine men many of my bisexual friends male and female all of my straight female friends and about half of my gay male friends appreciate a man on the softer side only two woman in my life like masculine men in my experience the more feminine men tend to be better nurturers to children they spend more time with them show more affection and are over all better at being a dad rather than just a father and there is a difference at least to me i am not letting a study con me as my original post i've always enjoyed my men to be a touch on the feminine side longer hair slightly more delicate features lean muscle rather than bulk i asked what your opinion was your personal opinion not your own preference that you would try to force on women as a whole feminine does not mean subservient it is a matter only of appearance not of their behavior women were shown pictures of men that were altered to look more or less feminine masculine they were told nothing of their health or behavior but simply tell us the traits you think a person with this face would have from what i have witnessed macho men have been less faithful and much more likely to leave a spouse within years of children being bore while the 'feminine' men are more likely to stay with a wife and help raise the children strong also does not define masculinity in this test considering that they were shown only pictures of faces which do not tell you what physical strength the body could have please do not lump all women together simply because you like something every one has different tastes i didn't say women always like the more feminine man i said i like more feminine men i did label others with my views please do not label others with yours belladonna after following the link i see that you did not even bother to write me up a new answer how nice of you to take the time to answer each question individually the power of pwn that is an excelent answer and very true as long as he's got a nice personality what does it matter what he looks like  Sexual orientation Sexual differentiation Biology and sexual

should i feel guilty for not being attracted to larger women it seems if i were to say that i am only attracted to thin fit women that people suddenly would think call me a jerk i think that a person's body type can tell you a lot about them and their personality what are everyone elses thoughts and i'm not saying that larger women can't be fun wonderful and interesting people or that we should shun them or anything like that most of the women in my family are bigger and i love them all i just find it admirable and attractive when a woman cares about the way she looks and puts time and effort into staying fit and besides being over weight is unhealthy for anyone why should we encourage people to be content with something that is bad for them would you encourage one of your close friends relatives to keep smoking just a thought not at all i am a larger woman not a whale but not petite and it doesn't bother me one bit everyone has a preference i prefer guys with darker hair eyes and skin that doesn't mean i hate pale people i just like what i like  Social rule Physical attractiveness Sexual attraction Undergrads Avenue Q Mojave people Fruits Basket About a Boy EastEnders Pitaten Kodocha Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Human sexual behavior Human skin color Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Transactional analysis Kender W.I.T.C.H.

what do you think of this my boss sent me this in an email i think it's very true despite the humor of it i'd like to know what you think obituary common sense today we mourn the passing of a beloved old friend common sense who has been with us for many years no one knows for sure how old he was since his birth records were long ago lost in bureaucratic red tape he will be remembered as having cultivated such valuable lessons as knowing when to come in out of the rain why the early bird gets the worm life isn't always fair and maybe it was my fault common sense lived by simple sound financial policies don't spend more than you earn and reliable parenting strategies adults not children are in charge his health began to deteriorate rapidly when well intentioned but overbearing regulations were set in place reports of a six year old boy charged with sexual harassm ent for kissing a classmate teens suspended from school for using mouthwash after lunch and a teacher fired for reprimanding an unruly student only worsened his condition common sense lost ground when parents attacked teachers for doing the job they themselves failed to do in disciplining their unruly children it declined even further when schools were required to get parental consent to administer aspirin sun lotion or a sticky plaster to a student but could not inform the parents when a student became pregnant and wanted to have an abortion common sense lost the will to live as the ten commandments became contraband churches became businesses and criminals received better treatment than their victims common sense took a beating when you couldn't legally defend yourself from a burglar in your own home and the burglar can sue you for assault common sense finally gave up the will to live after a woman failed to realize that a steaming cup of coff ee was hot she spilled a little in her lap and was promptly awarded a huge settlement common sense was preceded in death by his parents truth and trust his wife discretion his daughter responsibility and his son reason he is survived by three stepbrothers i know my rights someone else is to blame and i'm a victim not many attended his funeral because so few realized he was gone cinnamon for president common sense died when political correctness was born sometime in the mid 's i hate that common sense has passed but believe that it still thrives in the heart and souls of many of us i think of common sense like i do jesus christ passed but will rise again political correctness is the anti christ and will someday be defeated and banished to hell i hope i am alive to see the day i partially blame bill cosby and the television shows created around the time of his cosby show yes they had good morals but the viewers took things way too far family ties mr belvedere diff'rent strokes and other similar shows gave birth to political correctness i give credit to new shows like my name is earl south park the daily show all try to show some form of common sense thinking in their writing and scripts perhaps they are giving birth to the next generation of people with common sense who can create a large enough army to defeat the politically correct  Knots Landing Abortion debate One Tree Hill (TV series) Infantilism Hillary Rodham Clinton Church of Christ, Scientist Cultural Revolution Fred Phelps Theory of conduct Boston Public Intelligent design movement Insurance Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Charmed 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Age of consent Jon Secada Richard Littlejohn Spanking Ten Commandments Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Friends Scientology beliefs and practices John Howard Yoder One Life to Live Beavis and Butt-head Roman Catholic Church Abortion Sharon Tate Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Days of our Lives Separation of church and state Mystique (comics) Domestic violence Spidey Super Stories Marriage For Better or For Worse Sin Fahrenheit 9/11 Irna Phillips Coffee Mother Teresa Democratic Party (United States) Shaggy dog story Education in the People's Republic of China Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Divorce Abortion in the United States Royal Assent South Park Sexual abuse Charles Grandison Finney Eastern Orthodox Church Situation comedy Columbine High School massacre Original sin Appeal Child sexuality Affirmative action James I of England Only Fools and Horses Birth control Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword George W.

should family farms be saved i've heard a lot of people talking about how family farms are disappearing and being replaced by huge farms run by companies a lot of people talk about how we need to save the family farms however i've run across a rather disturbing statistic apparently the highest rate of work related deaths and injuries suffered by children are on family run farms it appears that having young children around all the powerful machinery used in modern farming is rather dangerous maybe farms should be run by companies that only use adult labor and not by families that have their children involved in doing work that can be so hazardous any thoughts on this subject no i am a firm believer in the family farm i along with my cousins have grown up on our family farm i think we are better people for that we understand a hards days work and that not every job is suppose to be fun or easy we along with other kids that grew up on farms have a better work ethic than some kids who didn't grow up on a farm because of this we learned responsibilty because well those h and ffa hogs and sheep and cows were ours and they weren't going to feed or water themselves i for one take from my farm experiences when it comes to something else while other people complain that something is hard i just think 'this isn't hard now halter breaking that calf that was hard' i'm not trying to say that it's not dangerous to have kids and even adults around farm machinery because it is i do feel though that todays elementary school age farm kids are being better educated on the risks around the family farm than when i was in elementary school last spring my ffa chapter did a farm safety presentation to the elementary school in our district that probably has the most farm kids attending it in a fun yet informative manner the kids learned about a variety of safety topics including tractor safety atv safety plant safety animal safety and general safety which included safe clothing for farm activities chemicals etc as an elementary student i'm an hs senior now i never had any kind of presentation like this in the years i was there they usually spent there time telling us to not smoke drink do other drugs and overlooked what was the danger to us farm kids farm accidents i'm glad that there are programs being presented like this now that i was able to be a part of presenting it in conclusion i believe that eliminating the family farm is not the answer but better informing the kids that live play and work on those farms is i think this might be group that we did our presentation through so if anyone's curious http www fs jk org  Organic farming Livestock Agriculture Factory farming Milton H.

if a pandemic swept the globe killing to billion humans would that really be such a bad thing of course at the time it would be a bit of a shame but concidering that we have no natural preditors we're living longer and the birth rate is rising would that not be better than a serious overpopulation problem possably resulting in the end of our species everyone dies but i'm sure that like me a lot of you would like humanity to live on which it could with a population of over a billion also other animals would benifit after the black death wildlife in europe flurished so concidering the bigger picture would it really be such a bad thing your thoughts i understand the spirit of your question and will attempt to answer forthrightly in the case of the black death there were positive benefits for humanity not just wildlife europe flourished after the plague because many literate intelligent people inherited money and property of the deceased victims it was the combination of widespread literacy because of the printing press money and freedom of thought that founded the renaissance the dynamic free market with all of its attendant opportunities was accelerated by greater separation from religious strangleholds on thought which in turn led to greater scientific enquiry survivors had money to invest and were of a universally anti religious pro scientific mindset art and culture fourished along side with increased freedom and business opportunities for everyone you also must remember that the plague was not artificially created by biochemists working for divisive governments looking for insidious weaponry if there were to be a worldwide pandemic at anytime in the future it is highly likely that whatever pathogen causes it will have been manmade intentionally introduced and certainly spread more widely by the greater traveling capacity of modern transportation there key differences between old plagues and potential new pandemics are modern transportation makes global dissemination of the pathogens possible not just regional or continental pandemic like the black death modern pathogens bird flu anthrax etc are all manufactured they were intentionally created by governments as biological weapons or are the result of mismanaged biological experiments those crucial differences hold horrifying possibilities far beyond the already awful consequences of deadly pandemics manmade pathogens usually have antidotes even if they do not have antidotes manmade pathogens are specifically designed to have a particular method of dissemination only those who have advance knowledge of these pathogens and their methods of deliver can successfully avoid contamination and therefore the deadly effects the only people who get these antidotes or avoid contamination are the wealthy the powerful those who commit the evil act and whatever populace those in power see fit to save if any future pandemic was intentionally delivered as a weapon by any government or government agent then it is likely that the evil people who created the pandemic would be the greatest benefactors that predicates a consolidation of power and ideological dominance that is the opposite of what happened in the renaissance after the plague the plague killed anyone and everyone from all social strata it did not discriminate there was no cure antidote or sure method of avoiding the naturally induced disease as such the plague was a precursor to intellectual freedom and scientific advancement because it redistributed wealth from the wealthy to the poor a diverse population that was less fettered by political dominance social ideology or religious doctrine that is not likely to be the scenario of a future pandemic in this nightmare scenario the governments and gigantic international corporations of tomorrow conspire to create one world government only those in power would benefit and their power would be amplified by technological influences such as radio id chips and electronic surveillance these insidious pernicious misuses of technology will create an imbalance in the natural checks on concentrated power with the advancement of world air travel television and the military misuse of biological weapons only those who have the wealth and power and whatever populations they deemed necessary to enslave would be able to survive that is the opposite effect of the natural disasters of the past  Influenza pandemic Black Death Liberalism Intellectual property Bubonic plague Human Overpopulation Intelligent design Pandemic Constitution of the Turkish Republic
