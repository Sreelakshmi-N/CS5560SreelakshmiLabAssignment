curious on why i have a cold sore ok so i guess i have had cold sores before in the past but i have been with the same guy for years now we are sexually active i have always given him oral sex but just recently this started happening every time i give him oral a couple days later i get a cold sore i'm not sure why this would start to happen now he is completely clean down there but if he did have something i would definitley have it since we've been together so long we stopped using protection about years ago how can i stop this from happening what does this mean does this mean he has something i guess the main question i have is if i do have this hsv could he catch it down there i would never do anything with him if i had any type of cold sore but i mean but what am i supposed to do thanks for any advice you can give me many people have discovered that there are 'triggers' for the cold sores for some people it is prolonged sun exposure for other people it is trauma to the lips like when they hold your mouth open for long periods at the dentist and for others it is related to dry lips for others there is no discernible connection at all they just come if you have hsv and perform oral sex on him with an active cold sore you can pass it on to him he would have the oral form of herpes on his genitals the good news about that is that hsv infections of the genitals are usually not severe and may never erupt and if they do there is a good chance that after the first time it will not happen again if you are having frequent outbreaks it may be a good idea for you to speak with a doctor about suppressive therapy you should also ask your bf to get tested if he already has antibodies to hsv out of people in the us have antibodies you won't need to worry about infecting him because he would already have made antibodies  Herpes simplex virus Oral sex Psoriasis Mouth ulcer Body piercing Cytomegalovirus AIDS Antibody Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS HIV test Safe sex Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Hepatitis Cancer Radiation therapy AIDS reappraisal Urinary incontinence Aciclovir Syphilis H5N1 Child sexuality Transmission (medicine) Asthma Group A streptococcal infection Ebola Androgen insensitivity syndrome Breastfeeding Transsexuality Stomach cancer Massage Multiple sclerosis Sexual orientation Lupus erythematosus Chronic fatigue syndrome Herpesviridae Multiple myeloma Duesberg hypothesis Lyme disease Chancroid Female genital cutting Influenza Pneumonia Wisdom teeth Genital wart Autoimmune diseases Strap-on dildo Clomipramine Common cold Hearing impairment Traumatic brain injury Dentistry Penis Immune system Prostate cancer Immunosuppressive drug Chlorpromazine Wound Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders HIV Malaria Acne Avian influenza Traumatic incident reduction Fertility awareness Gay slang Infectious mononucleosis Child pornography Oral contraceptive Monoclonal antibody Intersex surgery Condom Anal sex First aid HIV vaccine Human sexuality Religion and sexuality Child sexual abuse Glucocorticoid Chemotherapy Obsessive-compulsive disorder Graves-Basedow disease Blood transfusion Propranolol Satanic ritual abuse Diabetes mellitus Human sexual behavior Infantilism AIDS pandemic Allergy Dentures

aids virus in our world can anyone get aids from oral sex or does the stomach acid kill the virus yes you can get hiv from oral sex while oral sex is considered to be low risk compared with unprotected vaginal or anal sex it is still a risk you are correct stomach acid will render hiv non infectious instantly but hiv first has to travel through the mouth and down the esophagus before it hits the stomach acid in general the mouth is a pretty inhospitable place for hiv to get inside your blood stream but there are things that can increase your risk bleeding gums even small amounts of blood after brushing or flossing cuts oral sti infections lesions ulcers burns recent dental work the person performing oral sex is considered to be low risk and the person receiving it is at a theoretical negligible risk meaning that there has been no reported case of a person getting hiv infection from someone going down on them but it is theoretically possible it is recommended to wait mins hours after brushing or flossing your teeth or eating any food that irritates the lining of the mouth it is theoretically possible that people who have damaged esophaguses eg from gastric reflux could also act as a entry way to the blood stream for hiv and to correct an earlier answer hiv can only be transmitted by blood semen and pre ejaculatory fluid vaginal fluids breast milk not urine sweat tears or saliva  HIV Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Anal sex Tooth HIV test Sexually-transmitted infection Cytomegalovirus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Transmission (medicine) Herpes simplex virus Cancer Unsafe sexual practices Pneumonia AIDS pandemic Breastfeeding Pornographic movie Birth control Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Dental caries Hepatitis C Blood Crystal methamphetamine and sex Esophagus Tooth enamel Esophageal cancer Condom Oral contraceptive Rabies Hypoglycemia Paracetamol AIDS reappraisal Cervical cancer Human sexual behavior Methamphetamine Gingivitis Body piercing Timeline of AIDS Gonorrhoea Obstetrics Coeliac disease Foot-and-mouth disease Crohn's disease Helicobacter pylori Mouth ulcer Foodborne illness Semen Vomiting Digestion Chronic fatigue syndrome Peptic ulcer Antiretroviral drug Gastric acid Diabetes mellitus Caffeine Barebacking Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Stomach Kaposi's sarcoma Group sex Common cold AIDS in Africa Fertility awareness Folic acid Acne Sexual intercourse Vitamin C OPV AIDS hypothesis Gastroparesis Intravenous therapy Aspartame Body fluid Cat Psoriasis Poliomyelitis Hepatitis B First aid Radiation therapy Group A streptococcal infection Chlorpromazine Ebola Orgasm Garlic

question about hepatitis can you get hepatitis without having had sex before my friend recently had found out he had it but he has only had sex with one person and that person has only had sex with one person aswell which would be him and i know they are both being honest i just need explaining on how that could happen so please explain first of all there are numerous causes of hepatitis hepatitis simply means inflammation itis of the liver hepa alcohol drug toxicity environmental pollutants and viruses can all cause hepatitis there are other causes for sure the hepatitis viruses prefer to live in the liver and can cause damage and hepatitis they are transmitted in different ways hep a you can get from fecal oral contact countries with less than adequate sewage systems can have hep a in the water which is why you shouldn't drink water or use icecubes in these areas hep b can be transmitted from blood semen vaginal fluids breast milk and less commonly from saliva and tears it is considered to be a sexually transmitted disease hep c you get only from blood blood contact blood from one person has to come into contact with your blood there is a very small risk of sexual transmission though the mechanism is not fully understood that seems to increase if you are hiv but in the vast vast majority of cases it is non sexual transmission tatooing piercing sharing crack pipes can all possible transmit hep c hep d is transmitted just like hep b and actually can't exist in your body without already being infected with hep b hep e and possibly hep f can be transmitted fecal orally hep g is thought to be transmitted in similarr ways to hep c so it is very possible that your friend got hepatitis from something other than sex  Hepatitis Transmission (medicine) Oral sex Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS HIV Safe sex Anal sex Cancer Blood Body piercing Methamphetamine AIDS pandemic Herpes simplex virus Human sexual behavior Prostate cancer Rabies AIDS reappraisal Liver Infectious mononucleosis Condom Sexual intercourse Duesberg hypothesis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pneumonia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Paracetamol Malaria Vomiting Breastfeeding Birth control Pornographic actor Medical analysis of circumcision Semen Chagas disease Lassa fever Kaposi's sarcoma Crohn's disease Common cold West Nile virus Hepatitis E Unsafe sexual practices Earring Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus Bone marrow transplant Puberty Gonorrhoea Immune system Diabetes mellitus Entamoeba histolytica Harm reduction Group A streptococcal infection People's Republic of China Tattoo Sexual orientation Prostitution Psoriasis Foodborne illness Stomach cancer Antiviral drug Sexual abstinence Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Breast Diarrhea Ebola Oral contraceptive Cervical cancer Hypoglycemia Fecal incontinence Folic acid Lupus erythematosus Traumatic brain injury HIV Disease Progression Rates Ulcerative colitis Doxepin Pornographic movie Blood transfusion Personal lubricant Mosquito Tuberculosis Barebacking Marburg virus Human papillomavirus Orgy Urinary incontinence

anyone ever try using dental dam what can you say about it was it awful or ok i have for sure and no it wasn't awful i would suggest that you experiment before hand with various types of non lubricated condoms the lube on lubricated condoms tastes gross you can even find flavoured non lubed condoms so pick a flavour definitely apply lubricant to the side of the dental dam that will be in contact with the genitals vagina or anus to make it more pleasurable for your partner some people opt to use non microwaveable saran plastic wrap the microwaveable ones have small pores while there has not been much research in this area there has been one study that i am aware of it was with glad saran wrap non microwaveable of course and showed that it did prevent transmission of hsv and hsv but it is important to remember that plastic wrap is not subject to the rigoruous production standards that condoms are some people complain that dental dams made from condoms are too small and awkward and prefer plastic wrap but they are taking more of a risk bottom line it is better to use a latex polyurethane condom made into a dental dam or buy actual dental dams dentists offices use them mine calls them plastic raincoats to prevent stis but if you don't have one non microwavebale plastic wrap is better than nothing and try to use glad as it has been tested albeit in a small study  Condom Oral sex Strap-on dildo Anal sex Herpes simplex virus Personal lubricant Orgy Menstrual cup Masturbation Human sexual behavior Birth control Sexually-transmitted infection Motor oil Pornographic movie Genital wart Fisting Human papillomavirus AIDS Anal masturbation Manual transmission Sexual intercourse Butt plug Child sexuality Cervical cancer Gay bathhouse Die (manufacturing) Diaphragm (contraceptive) Dentistry Methamphetamine Prostitution Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Gonorrhoea Tooth Crystal methamphetamine and sex Tampon Unsafe sexual practices Milk Prostate cancer Vulva Tattoo Screw Dental brace Sexual abstinence Rape Dyspareunia Medical analysis of circumcision AIDS pandemic Hazing Group sex Proper Condom Use Tooth enamel Goatse.cx Thermal power station BDSM Polyurethane Drill bit Orgasm Glycerin Doctorate Tofu Barebacking Female genital cutting Halitosis Hangul HSV color space Dental caries Genericized trademark Lubricant Professional wrestling throws Casting Circumcision Anus Intersex surgery Paranoia Agent Harm reduction Bong Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Multiple sclerosis Plastic bag Vagina Skateboarding trick Chair Glacier Lionel Corporation Vulvovaginal health Gross domestic product Wire Sexual arousal Nonoxynol-9 Phthalates M16 (rifle) Timpani Solar power satellite

how long can the hiv virus survive outside the human body e g on a needle it completely depends on the amount of hiv the amount of fluid it is carried in and where it is hiv is very easy to kill outside of the body if you are talking about a drop of blood any hiv in it will be rendered non infectious very quickly if you are talking about a pool of blood it will take longer inside of a syringe hiv could theoretically stay infectious longer as there is limited exposure to air and the blood will take longer to dry out you can't really answer this question as there is too much variation and a lot of people have misunderstood the whole exposure to air will kill hiv as meaning that hiv is killed instantly outside of the body and that is incorrect it completely depends on the ambient temperature the amount of fluid which hiv is contained in ie blood semen vaginal fluids or breastmilk etc hope this helps ps needle stick injuries have a transmission infection rate of about  HIV AIDS HIV test Hepatitis C AIDS reappraisal Breastfeeding Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Sexually-transmitted infection Intravenous therapy Transmission (medicine) Semen Cytomegalovirus Ebola Hepatitis B Rabies Pneumonia Safe sex Timeline of AIDS Prostate cancer Anopheles Syringe Anal sex AIDS pandemic Drowning HIV vaccine Condom Infectious disease AIDS in Africa Oral sex Malaria Human T-lymphotropic virus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Herpes simplex virus Tattoo Carbon dioxide Common cold Toxoplasmosis Antiretroviral drug Earring Dialysis Nuclear fallout Poliomyelitis Human sexual behavior 28 Days Later Cancer Infectious mononucleosis Mosquito Stomach cancer Virus Immune system OPV AIDS hypothesis Decompression sickness Duesberg hypothesis Chronic fatigue syndrome Rocky Mountain spotted fever Methamphetamine Vaccine Bacteria Mesothelioma Pornographic movie Hepatitis Penis Smallpox STS-50 Cirrhosis Lassa fever Influenza Swimming Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Medical analysis of circumcision Knife Jet engine Blood donation Dehydration Robert Gallo Carburetor Foodborne illness Diabetes mellitus Pathogen Multiple sclerosis Spacecraft propulsion Hypodermic needle Liquid breathing Blood pressure Coeliac disease Body fluid H5N1 Sterilization (microbiology) Motorcycle Apoptosis

if you have herpes how many days out of the year can you not have sex b c of painful outbreaks or just outbreaks in general not necessarily painful between a girl having her period and her partner having outbreaks i am concerned by how often sex will have to be avoided i know it is different for everyone but would appreciate examples from people that have it or whose partners have it bad examples or good please share once i got herpes i learned very quickly that outbreaks can be triggered by stress since i am a type a individual i had to learn to take things slower not do so much all the time and relax of course this was better for me as a person also but it took getting herpes for that to happen i would say i had outbreaks maybe once a year or once every years for several years and then less and less i never get them anymore probably not for years or so that's what happens every time you have an outbreak your body builds up antibodies and even though it will live in your nervous system forever it will eventually stop coming out in the form of outbreaks of sores on your genitals i have known people who had outbreaks much more often than i did but they also lived much more stressful lives and i think you can choose to change that even though it might be difficult painful sores in your genital region can really motivate you to change though when i had an outbreak i stopped having sex as soon as i felt the tingling that might signal an oubreak waited to see if it was an outbreak stayed off the sex while the sores were visible and waited to have sex until all symptoms had been gone for several days since an oubreak for me would last about a week or so this means i would not have sex for about weeks i hope this is helpful  Herpes simplex virus Breastfeeding Sexually-transmitted infection Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Herpes zoster Chronic fatigue syndrome Psoriasis Human sexual behavior Mouth ulcer Oral sex Urinary incontinence Transsexuality Stomach cancer Herpesviridae Multiple sclerosis Transactional analysis Pain Infantilism AIDS Cytomegalovirus Transgender Transmission (medicine) Carpal tunnel syndrome Influenza Obsessive-compulsive disorder Massage Repetitive strain injury Syphilis Anxiety Panic attack Prostate cancer Autoimmune diseases Body piercing Pneumonia Hay fever Gender role Premature ejaculation Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Post-traumatic stress disorder Orgasm Cancer Traumatic brain injury Female genital cutting Migraine Sexual orientation Penis Antibody Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Social rule Group A streptococcal infection Spider Borderline personality disorder HIV test Child sexuality Serial killer Domestic rabbit Virus Asexuality Anorexia nervosa Ebola Jon Secada BDSM Masturbation Insomnia Child pornography Stress (medicine) Dog training Sento Reflexology Chancroid Psychosis Androgen insensitivity syndrome First aid Fertility awareness Equine conformation Lupus erythematosus Radiation therapy Poliomyelitis Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Polyamory Strap-on dildo H5N1 Hepatitis C Clinical depression History of intersex surgery Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Puberty Self-harm Fibromyalgia Genital wart Coeliac disease Lucid dreaming Jam (TV series) Menstrual cycle Gender identity Traumatic incident reduction Common cold

what's clymidia i have it but i don't know exactly what it is chlamydia are bacteria that cause various infections the most common one people think about and probably the one you have is usually sexually transmitted many people who have chlamydia can be asymptomatic though women can have abdominal pain discharge and occasionally pain during intercourse more seriously it can cause pelvic inflammatory disease which can cause scarring inside of your uterus making it more difficult to carry pregnancies to full term and increasing your risk for ectopic tubal pregnancies if you have been diagnosed your doctor should have given you some antibiotics to take which should clear it up without too much problem the most important thing is to make sure your partner gets treated also otherwise he will reinfect you of course the best way to avoid getting it in the first place is to use condoms  Gonorrhoea Chlamydia Sexually-transmitted infection Ectopic pregnancy Sexual intercourse Abortion Cervical cancer Miscarriage Infertility AIDS Anal sex Herpes simplex virus Condom Pneumonia Obstetrics Lymphogranuloma venereum Oral sex Medical analysis of circumcision Birth control Endometrial cancer Safe sex Multiple sclerosis Tuberculosis Pregnancy Chronic fatigue syndrome Acne Trichomoniasis Conjunctivitis Abdominal pain Childbirth Prostatitis Androgen insensitivity syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fecal incontinence Sexual abstinence Chlamydophila pneumoniae Lupus erythematosus Cancer Fertility awareness Cirrhosis Oral contraceptive Menstrual cup Vulvovaginal health Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cardiovascular disease Prostate cancer Autoimmune diseases Intersex surgery Premature birth Crohn's disease Urinary incontinence Folic acid Rocky Mountain spotted fever Emergency contraception Non-gonococcal urethritis Human sexual behavior Hepatitis Turner syndrome Inflammation Endocarditis Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Ulcerative colitis Menstrual cycle Gastroesophageal reflux disease Sex education Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Lyme disease Dysmenorrhea Escherichia coli O157:H7 Sexual dysfunction Diverticulitis Sterilization (surgical procedure) Transmission (medicine) Ovarian cyst Diarrhea Dyspareunia Common cold Circumcision Group A streptococcal infection Schistosomiasis Asthma Endoscopy Hepatitis C Guinea pig Gout Rheumatic fever Medicine Intrauterine device Clostridium difficile Spina bifida

why do people think hiv can pass through latex condoms i keep reading answers from people saying things like hiv can go through a condom where are these people getting their information are they doing any research for the person above me do you know how they test condoms in the us each condom is electronically tested for holes and defects also condom manufacturers sample each lot of finished packaged condoms and visually examine them for holes using a water leak test condom manufacturers also tests lots for physical characteristics using the air burst test and the tensile strength test so you're telling me they're not doing what they're supposed to do and you're telling me that your testing of condoms are more precise and accurate than theirs if of condoms were defective then trojan and lifestyles will go out of business hiv will not penetrate a condom the retard above me probably used their teeth to open up the package therefore there were holes either that or he she has long finger nails  Condom Safe sex Anal sex HIV AIDS reappraisal Oral sex AIDS Gonorrhoea Herpes simplex virus Mental retardation Carbon nanotube HIV test Pornographic movie AIDS in Africa Explosive material Nine Inch Nails Stopping power Prenatal diagnosis Casting Wood Concrete Unsafe sexual practices Spark plug Crystal methamphetamine and sex Industrial engineering 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Tattoo Shroud of Turin Barebacking Screw Hall effect George Costanza Stress (physics) Gay bathhouse Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Menstrual cup Drill bit Hypoglycemia Tensile strength Birth control Radiometric dating Gramophone record LaTeX Radiation hardening Seismic retrofit Strap-on dildo Normal distribution Debugging Standardized testing General relativity Prostitution in Nevada Nuclear weapon design Scientific method Rape Aphasia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Rent (musical) Internal ballistics The Chemical Brothers Sex toy Duesberg hypothesis B-47 Stratojet Tampon Gamma ray burst Methamphetamine Cephalic disorder Pornographic actor Gay slang STS-62 Solar cell Death Depleted uranium Opportunity rover Knife Tire Sexually-transmitted infection Food and Drug Administration Prostate cancer Jute Gravity Sex education Philosophy of science Black hole Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Morse Code M16 (rifle) Glass Handloading Medical analysis of circumcision RFID Teller-Ulam design Autism Apoptosis Firearm Growth hormone treatment Obstetrics Software testing GED Machine vision

can one contract hiv from oral contact only educated answers only please i'm not looking for opinion here the answer to your question is yes i know of a few people whose only risk activity was oral sex and they became hiv oral sex oral vaginal oral penile is considered to be a low risk activity compared to the high risk activity of unprotected vaginal or anal sex there are four classifications for risk according to this model to figure out where an activity lies on the scale researchers ask two questions is it theoretically possible that is is there an exchange of blood semen pre ejaculatory fluid vaginal fluids or breast milk of all the cases reported clinically how many people are suspected of having been infected through that particular activity so for no risk not theoretically possible no cases reported theoretical risk sometimes called negligible risk theoretically possible no known cases of transmission low risk theoretically possible a relatively small number of cases compared to high risk high risk theoretically possible and the vast majority of infections occur through this activity some of the factors that can increase the likelihood of becoming hiv from oral vaginal oral penile sex are partner has a high viral load recently infected performer has cuts sores lesions burns recent dental work or stis in the oral esophageal area it is recommended that a person wait min hours differing opinions after brushing or flossing your teeth before engaging in oral sex as the brushing flossing can irritate the gum line and cause bleeding oral anal contact is not efficient at all in transmitting hiv however there are a variety of other stis and bacterial infections that can be transmitted easily  Herpes simplex virus Human sexual behavior AIDS pandemic HIV test Cytomegalovirus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cervical cancer Sexual intercourse Transmission (medicine) Crystal methamphetamine and sex Orgasm Unsafe sexual practices Hepatitis C Pneumonia Oral contraceptive Group A streptococcal infection Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Breastfeeding AIDS in Africa Condom Cancer Body piercing Group sex Human papillomavirus Prostate cancer Common cold Methamphetamine AIDS reappraisal Birth control Barebacking Abortion Pornographic movie Gingivitis Multiple sclerosis Gonorrhoea Kaposi's sarcoma Hepatitis B Sex education Tuberculosis Puberty Duesberg hypothesis Orgy Fisting Intersex surgery Urinary incontinence Sexual orientation Ulcerative colitis Paracetamol Breast cancer Timeline of AIDS Chronic fatigue syndrome Tooth enamel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Psoriasis Androgen insensitivity syndrome Ovarian cancer Diarrhea Zoophilia Chagas disease Fertility awareness Crohn's disease Intravenous therapy Child sexuality Lawrence v.

testing for std's i know that for males chlamydia is tested with a q tip type thing that is inserted in theyre uretha somewhat painful if u ask me my question is that if theres other ways of gettin tested for that like a pee test or some sort so there is pee tests well i kinda figured there was because i have a g f who got tested for that and all she needed to do was pee so does that pee test is the same and the q tip test is there a difference is one more accurate than the other i dont get why they have two completely different tests for one thing seriously and all joking aside no the reason for the swab is to increase the chances of obtaining bacteria for the sample that can actually be grown for identification if needbe if you urinate you would flush out most of the bacteria and the chemistry of the urine would destroy most of it what bacteria did survive to grow might have come from your bladder your prostate or kidneys and it would take a couple days to grow enough to identify presuming that you won't want to wait that long for what could be a missed diagnosis it's quicker and more efficient to use the cotton swab yeah it's unpleasant and sometimes painful but it does tend to serve as a reminder next time to wear a raincoat bacteria don't eat through latex there were some studies done to see if chlamydia could be detected using urine and although sometimes it could it wasn't considered reliable enough for males especially the best way remains to use a swab  Prostate cancer Gonorrhoea Medical analysis of circumcision Cancer Urinary tract infection Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cystoscopy Urinary system Anal sex Oral sex Bacteria Kidney stone Group A streptococcal infection Pneumonia Hypoglycemia Reiter's syndrome Urination Agar plate Menstrual cup Stomach cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Pelvic inflammatory disease Cytomegalovirus Menstrual cycle Obstetrics Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Radiation therapy Candidiasis Drug test Diabetes mellitus HIV test Diaper Quicksort Genetically modified food Leptospirosis Chronic fatigue syndrome IgA nephropathy Strap-on dildo Benign prostatic hyperplasia Tour de France Needle aspiration biopsy Prostatitis Insulin Jon Secada Conjunctivitis Colorectal cancer Autism Epididymitis Urethra Medicine Multiple sclerosis Chlamydia Acute renal failure Escherichia coli O157:H7 Common cold Endometriosis Legionellosis Clomipramine Myocardial infarction Crohn's disease Infertility Condom Genetic fingerprinting Ulcerative colitis Shroud of Turin Medical laboratory Science Dairy Cotton swab Vulvovaginal health Calvin and Hobbes Redundant array of independent disks Kashrut Toilet humour Lymphogranuloma venereum Growth hormone treatment Burial Renal cell carcinoma Kidney Mass spectrometry Mesothelioma Non-gonococcal urethritis Little Britain Marathon (sport) Toilet Scientific method Tattoo Diabetic nephropathy Internal ballistics Ben Johnson (athlete) Dehydration Ice core

uti vs chlamydia okay so here i go two weeks ago i went to the doctor feeling a stinging pain when urinating i went to the doctor and she gave me a single dose of antibiotics for a uti the pain came back fairly quickly say days i went back to the doctor after popping endless cranberry supplements and drowning myself in h o she gave me a weeks supply of antibiotics and made me pee ina cup again she called today and said my culture was negitive for infection so i figured maybe i killed it what im truly worried about is that it was not a uti at all and i may have caught chlamydia anyone have any idea it sounds possible if your doctor gave you cipro as an antibiotic it should wipe out most std's along with the uti you might have to do a second or even third round of antibiotics to completly rid yourself of the infection from what you are describing i think it is already gone i wouldn't automatically jump to the chlamydia diagnosis as uti infections can be caused by many things you are already following a good treatment plan so don't worry too much about it  Urinary tract infection Gonorrhoea Medical analysis of circumcision Pelvic inflammatory disease Endocarditis Group A streptococcal infection Lymphogranuloma venereum Urinary incontinence Pneumonia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Penicillin Reiter's syndrome Prostate cancer Antibiotic Common cold Infectious disease Chlamydophila pneumoniae Non-gonococcal urethritis Hip fracture Cellulitis Epididymitis Conjunctivitis Ciprofloxacin Anthrax Syphilis Cardiovascular disease Bubonic plague Tuberculosis Mastoiditis Guinea pig Virus Cephalexin Childbirth Urine Lyme disease Sickle-cell disease Stomach cancer Hepatitis Penis Psoriasis Pharmacology Malaria Allergy Biological warfare Theory of conduct Peptic ulcer Legionellosis Cystoscopy Mouth ulcer Leptospirosis Irritable bowel syndrome Psittacosis Ehrlichiosis Protein-energy malnutrition Schistosomiasis Rabies Fancy rat Vancomycin Cancer Chu-Han contention Medicine Helicobacter pylori Diving Traditional Chinese medicine Breastfeeding Meningitis Acne Domestic rabbit Hepatitis C Hearing impairment Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Bone marrow transplant Smallpox Heartworm Crohn's disease Herpes simplex virus Rocky Mountain spotted fever Clostridium difficile Candidiasis Ebola Radiation therapy Traumatic brain injury Aspergillosis Gastroparesis Lung cancer Eczema Ben Johnson (athlete) Marburg virus Cystic fibrosis Upper respiratory tract infection Diseases of the honeybee Needle aspiration biopsy Pharyngitis Obstetrics Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder 1957 World Series

rash or herpes i have this rash near the bottom of my nose i am afriad that it might be herpes even tho i never encounter any infected subjects in short terms i am a virgin i also believe that it might a rash from some cold however i didnt develop a cold yet it doesnt hurt it just doesnt feel well when i touch it any suggestions thanks here is more info about the herpes herpes of the mouth and face usually infect children under the age of five years about of these children experience no signs of illness or rash during the first infection initially the appearance of a small ulcer at the corner of the mouth or edge of the nostrils shows up during the third to fifth recurrence of infection typically a child will catch the virus from a friend or family member who has a cold sore about two to ten days after being exposed to the virus the child may develop a high fever stop eating and become very fretful the mouth becomes sore and the gums the inside of the mouth and the lips turn very red and swollen many blisters appear in the same area and break down to raw red ulcers after a day or two there is usually a swelling of the glands in the neck and other parts of the body may become infected an adult who has not already been infected with herpes may develop similar disease and be even sicker than a child the body rallies to the defense and everything returns to normal after a week to ten days the fever and swelling disappear followed by the sores healing over without leaving any scars recurrent herpes of the mouth during the first attack primary outbreak the herpes virus has climbed through the nerves to the base of the brain seeking protection from the body's defenses by going dormant these evasive viruses hide in the deep nerve ganglion cells that run to the mouth and skin around it one day several months or even years later the virus may awaken again this awakening is usually caused by some form of stress or fever the herpes virus once awakened travels back down the nerves and reappears inside your mouth nose or around your lips to produce the familiar blistering cold sores most of the time you will have some warning that the attack is about to begin this shows up as numbness or a tingling sensation in the area medically known as prodromal symptoms the blisters come shortly thereafter breaking into red ulcers and then crust over and heal without scarring in a few days generally a recurrent episode is less disruptive to the body as a whole in effect you will not have the same pain and discomfort in your mouth that the first attack produced diagnosis tests if you think you have the virus see a doctor while symptoms are still present the doctor will look at the area take a sample from the sore s and test to see if the herpes virus is present the test you should request is a specific virus culture or assay for herpes virus remember the test will not work if the sores have healed  Smallpox AIDS Chronic fatigue syndrome Infectious mononucleosis Ebola Lupus erythematosus Urinary incontinence Cephalic disorder Coeliac disease Medicine Prostate cancer Ulcer Cancer Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Oral sex HIV test Psoriasis Hypoglycemia Tuberculosis Pharyngitis Marburg virus Epilepsy Ulcerative colitis Carpal tunnel syndrome Radiation therapy Sexually-transmitted infection Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Rabies Malaria Measles Gonorrhoea Diabetes mellitus Leukemia Cellulitis Homeopathy Herpesviridae Acne Peptic ulcer Lyme disease Decompression sickness Conjunctivitis Foot-and-mouth disease Monkeypox Skin Eczema Reflexology Migraine Erysipelas Encephalitis Poliomyelitis Diarrhea Fibromyalgia Autism Allergy Clinical depression Hay fever Gastroesophageal reflux disease Chickenpox Rash Biological warfare Cirrhosis Body piercing Penis Domestic rabbit Equine conformation Puberty Anthrax First aid Breastfeeding Stroke Rubella West Nile virus Autonomic nervous system Mumps Malignant melanoma Lung cancer IgA nephropathy Sickle-cell disease Cancer of the larynx Fecal incontinence Influenza

what do you think about individuals with hiv aids who try to justify being sexually active i hear it time and again its part of my 'quality of life' and i have the right to have sex if i use precautions i think these 'precautions' they are reffering to are not always fool proof and they are putting people at risk it just seems to me like having sex for your 'quality of life' should be the last thing on your mind when you are dealing with something that is going to kill you and possibly kill other people isn't it saving a lot of grief and pain if they just jerk off miata do you have aids is that what this is all about if not then go ahead have sex with one of your friends for some years and contract it because oh whats the harm having aids is like having the cold virus huh its people like you who i actually think promote std's your a jerk hiv aids positive individual can be prosecuted criminally for engaging in sexual activity without the knowledge of their sexual partner however if someone voluntarily has intercourse with them while knowing beforehand i have nothing to say about that except that is a totally stupid idea if someone with hiv aids wants to have sex they probably should find a support group and meet someone their who also has problems and not selfishly coerce innocent individuals into emotional entanglement so they can prey upon them they should go rub off a batch and try to reflect upon their life and not be so shallow  Human sexual behavior Sexually-transmitted infection AIDS Sexual abstinence Safe sex Sexual intercourse Sex education AIDS pandemic Lawrence v.

question about herpes im not sure if i have it or not but the symptoms seem to be adding up im gonna get tested tommorow but im curious if it is herpes id only have had the break out around my mouth does that mean the part of the skin that came in contact with the infected person is the only part that would get infected on me just curious cause i dont have any sort of break out below the belt also ive heard the first outbreak is the worst is this true both forms of herpes hsv usually associated with cold sores around the mouth and hsv usually associated with genital blisters sores although either variation can infect you either above or below the belt can be spread even if the infected person is not actively having an outbreak this is known as asymptomatic shedding where virus particles are given off it does require direct contact to get infected you can spread the virus from the original infection site to other locations by scratching rubbing touching the infected area and then another part of your body so if you or your partner have an outbreak it is especially important to wash well with soap and water after any possible contact with infected skin for most people the first outbreak is often the worst but also the first year can have some pretty bad obs your body does seem to adapt over time and outbreaks become less frequent and less severe stress is a trigger for outbreaks for many people as are a number of foods especially chocolate and nuts incluidng peanuts get tested and most reliable tests are the western blot test and the immunoblot test testing should be about months after exposure and possibly your first outbreak because it takes your body many weeks to generate enough antibodies to the virus to accurately detect and determine the variation hsv or hsv good luck and if you do have herpes there are plenty of support groups around the country as well as on line search in yahoo groups under heath  Sexually-transmitted infection Cytomegalovirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome HIV test Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Syphilis Common cold Virus Group A streptococcal infection Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS AIDS reappraisal Avian influenza Psoriasis Pneumonia Ebola Chronic fatigue syndrome Influenza Herpes zoster H5N1 Foot-and-mouth disease Hepatitis C Urinary incontinence Eczema Smallpox Cancer Stomach cancer Herpesviridae AIDS Lassa fever Spanish flu Escherichia coli O157:H7 Breastfeeding Marburg virus Antibody Mouth ulcer Oral sex Hay fever Allergy Lupus erythematosus Genital wart Measles Infectious mononucleosis Conjunctivitis Computer virus Rotavirus Hepatitis B Lyme disease Poliomyelitis Multiple sclerosis Immune system Body piercing Acne Epilepsy Malaria Human papillomavirus West Nile virus Tattoo Entamoeba histolytica Radiation therapy Dandruff Gonorrhoea First aid Norwalk virus group Toxoplasmosis Coeliac disease Safe sex 28 Days Later Legionellosis Autoimmune diseases Anthrax Traumatic brain injury Peanut Epstein-Barr virus Protein Homeopathy Tuberculosis Bell's palsy Post Polio syndrome Antiviral drug Foodborne illness Influenza pandemic HIV HIV vaccine Autism Biological warfare Heartworm Chickenpox HIV Disease Progression Rates

i think i may have herpes i found a couple two or three whiteish bumps on my vulva that resembled ingrown hairs a week after having unprotected sex with a new partner who claimed to be clean the area itched like mad and the bumps were sore and lasted a little over a week at first i thought it was bad razor burn because i tend to shave down there without shaving cream the bumps never crusted over before going away which is something that every website i've checked says happens i went to my doctor but my blood tests came back unsure and my doctor wants me to retake them in weeks so now i'm confused about what to do and still unsure if this is herpes or not help herpes doesn't always have to crust over you can have areas that burn and itch and it can look like razor burn if your test came back inconclusive i would do what your md suggested get the blood test again in weeks in the meantime i would not have unprotected sex if you do have herpes you will be spreading it to other partners if you do have it you can take medication to decrease the outbreaks but there is no cure for genital herpes and remember if you do end up having it it is your responsibility to inform your partners and from then on you should always use protection  Psoriasis Sexually-transmitted infection Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pubic hair Mouth ulcer Prostate cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Stomach cancer Hepatitis C Oral sex Eczema Strap-on dildo Group A streptococcal infection AIDS Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Shaving Safe sex Depilation Acne Herpesviridae Transmission (medicine) Sexual dysfunction Malignant melanoma Fecal incontinence Scabies Cocaine Pseudofolliculitis barbae The Shining (film) Epilepsy Ebola Massage Razor Vulva Medical analysis of circumcision Hair Herpes zoster Syphilis Marburg virus Traumatic brain injury Anal sex Gay bathhouse Genital wart Homeopathy Baldness Aspartame Head shaving Female genital cutting Methamphetamine Crystal methamphetamine and sex Little Britain Sento Breastfeeding Big Brother UK series 6 Androgen insensitivity syndrome Conjunctivitis Atkins Nutritional Approach Pneumonia Colorectal cancer Same-sex marriage Waxing Human sexuality Virus Duesberg hypothesis Cirrhosis Allergy Carbon dioxide Multiple sclerosis HIV test Condom Kurt Angle Beard Occam's Razor Chickenpox Masturbation Bondage (BDSM) Anus Sex education Penis Cytomegalovirus Body piercing Lung cancer Crab louse Prenatal diagnosis Sex organ Hepatitis Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Acute lymphoblastic leukemia H5N1 Opioid Urinary incontinence Marilyn Monroe Castration Alzheimer's disease Vulvovaginal health Child sexuality Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Barber

std question iwas just wondering if it's even remotely possible to contract an std if niether partner has one i've always wondered because if they have to be transmitted from someone else then where did they come from i imagine that they evolved from some other diseases but i still have to ask bettter safe than sorry i'm asking if it's possible during intercourse to get an std if niether person has it think about it if an std has to be transmitted from another person then someone somewhere spontaneously contracted it from something other than another person no if neither partner has an std they cannot transmit it to someone else stds cannot and do not spontaneously appear one person has to do something that would put them in a position to contract an std i get what you're saying about things having to start somewhere you're right everything has to start somewhere in the case of stds it starts when a person comes into contact with a bacteria or virus that can be transmitted sexually so with hiv the current consensus is that people in africa killed and ate chimpanzees that were infected with the chimpanzee version of immuno deficiency virus called siv when people came into contact with infected blood the virus was able to mutate and become dangerous to humans being a sexually transmitted disease the virus was able to quickly spread as you can see by the example it was not a spontaneous event the first person did not simply wake up one day and have hiv there was a specific event outside of his body that occurred that's how it works someone a long time ago came into contact with a virus or bacteria and passed it along so no stds will be transmitted or appear if neither partner has one hope this answers your question  Sexually-transmitted infection AIDS AIDS reappraisal Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS HIV Oral sex AIDS pandemic Duesberg hypothesis Human sexual behavior Gonorrhoea OPV AIDS hypothesis Hepatitis C HIV test Safe sex HIV vaccine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cytomegalovirus Virus Common cold Condom Medical analysis of circumcision Anal sex Human papillomavirus Ebola Smallpox Herpes simplex virus Computer virus AIDS origin H5N1 Sexual intercourse Syphilis Hepatitis Pelvic inflammatory disease Unsafe sexual practices Tuberculosis Rabies Hepatitis B Infectious disease Evolution Lymphogranuloma venereum AIDS in Africa Simian immunodeficiency virus Prostitution Index case Foodborne illness Malaria Influenza Sexual abstinence Methamphetamine Immune system Autism AIDS in the United States West Nile virus Human Meme Monkeypox Monogamy Cancer Sexual orientation Kaposi's sarcoma Sex education Gene therapy Escherichia coli O157:H7 Antiviral drug AIDS conspiracy theories Antiretroviral drug 28 Days Later Lassa fever Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus Foot-and-mouth disease Orgy Sexual dysfunction Crystal methamphetamine and sex Rape Birth control Chimpanzee Sexual network Genetically modified food Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease Spanish flu Zoonosis Pandemic Child sexuality Promiscuity Measles Genetically modified organism Infectious mononucleosis Nutrition Chronic fatigue syndrome

if person a has aids and person b is std free if person b fucks person a in the ass will person b get aids person a aids person b no aids but person b has sex without protection most of the answers to these questions are inaccurate yes it is definitely possible that person b will be infected with hiv however hiv is not transmitted of the time there are a variety of factors that play into whether or not someone gets infected we know this from years and years of patient experience there have been people who were infected for years before they knew it and their partners were not infected this was seen at the very beginning of the aids epidemic with gay men who were hiv and didn't know as hiv wasn't discovered yet and they did not infect their partner things that can increase decrease risk are current infections with other stis put you at increased risk for both acquiring hiv or transmitting it if you are already infected consistent and correct condom use decreases your risk drastically possibly by up to but please note i said consistent every time and correctly using condoms if you were to ask people on the street about proper condom use and have them put one on a fake penis out of will do it incorrectly genetic factors we now are beginning to understand the immunological and genetic factors that make it more difficult for hiv to infect someone and make it harder for hiv to replicate once infected these factors seem to be present in a very small percentage of the human population i would like to address some of the other comments made no it is not bad to have sex with someone who is hiv as long as you practice complete safer sex your risk for acquiring hiv is very low i know of many magnetic couples one person is one person is hence magnetic who have been together for years and have not transmitted hiv to the uninfected partner with love and compassion sex can be fulfilling and safe with an hiv partner vaginal sex can also cause microtears no matter how much lubricant is used so anal sex doesn't corner the market on that one no emilia there is no where near risk of transmission that is completely false hope this helps  Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS HIV AIDS pandemic AIDS reappraisal Herpes simplex virus Crystal methamphetamine and sex Medical analysis of circumcision Barebacking HIV vaccine Duesberg hypothesis HIV test Sexual intercourse AIDS in Africa Pornographic movie Sex education Birth control Harm reduction Orgy Gonorrhoea Gay bathhouse Antiretroviral drug Breastfeeding Timeline of AIDS Hepatitis C Strap-on dildo Human papillomavirus Transmission (medicine) HIV Disease Progression Rates Methamphetamine Prostitution Fisting Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sexual orientation Gay slang Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Virus Kaposi's sarcoma HIV structure and genome Sex toy Hearing impairment Unsafe sexual practices Prostate cancer Intersex surgery John Holmes (actor) Pelvic inflammatory disease Password Hepatitis B Pornographic actor Monogamy Circumcision AIDS in the United States Gender role Sexual abstinence Cancer Cytomegalovirus Body piercing Computer virus Human sexuality Anal masturbation Same-sex marriage Nonoxynol-9 Human penis size Biology and sexual orientation Blood transfusion Rape Multiple sclerosis Bisexuality Oral contraceptive Androgen insensitivity syndrome Index case Masturbation Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Tattoo Orgasm H5N1 Toxoplasmosis Earring Genetically modified food Malaria Rabies Promiscuity Domestic violence Abortion debate

does anyone know a few weeks ago i found out through my doctor that i had chlamydia well i was supposed to go back to the doctor on this past friday to make sure the infection was gone but something came up at work i've rescheduled my appt but it's not until the th of this month i've still been having this unpleasant odor so i'm not sure if the infection is gone i took the pill two pills at the same time on the th of july so has it been long enough for the infection to be gone or what how long does it take after taking the pill for the symptoms and infection to leave if anyone has experienced this or has experience with these kinds of situations please help me thanks in advance for your help and concerns also i saw this commercial for a product that helps detect vaginal infections by color has anyone else seen that commercial i was wondering where i could go in a store and purchase something like this test of cure for chalmydia a test after treatment to make sure infection is cleared is not routinely indicated if a recommended treatment is taken and symptoms and signs disappear and there is no re exposure to an untreated partner except where compliance with treatment was not complete if an alternative treatment was used in all pre pubertal children in all pregnant women if indicated test of cure should be done weeks after the completion of effective treatment earlier and you risk false positive results from the presence of non viable chlamydial bacteria it is recommended however for you to be screened months post treatment as reinfection risk is high you mentioned taking a single dose of medicine and the only drug for chlamydia fitting that description is azithromycin zithromax which is a prefered treatment for chlamydia meaning that a test of cure unless you fit one of the above exceptions is not indicated unpleasant odor is not a recognized symptom of chlamydial infection in women so you should be fine but if you are experiencing any odd symptoms you should be checked out by a healthcare practitioner who is familiar with stis hope this helps  Sexually-transmitted infection Psoriasis Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Malaria Cancer Syphilis Breast cancer AIDS Folic acid Cytomegalovirus Asthma Homeopathy Ulcerative colitis Hypoglycemia Group A streptococcal infection Chlamydia Acne Tuberculosis Coeliac disease Colorectal cancer Multiple sclerosis Rabies Stomach cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Herpes simplex virus Pneumonia Tuberculosis treatment HIV HIV test Heartworm Miscarriage Antiretroviral drug Medical analysis of circumcision Oral contraceptive Bipolar disorder Medicine Migraine Haloperidol Abortion Clinical depression Allergy Lung cancer Malignant melanoma Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Lymphogranuloma venereum Fibromyalgia Breastfeeding Quackery Guinea pig Common cold Traditional Chinese medicine Vitamin C Stroke Diazepam Ovarian cancer Autism Transsexuality Psychosis Schizophrenia Hepatitis B Androgen insensitivity syndrome Endometriosis Eczema Oral sex HIV vaccine Childbirth Alternative medicine Hypertension Chlorpromazine Decompression sickness Anthrax Anorexia nervosa Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Antidepressant Leukemia Growth hormone treatment Spina bifida Mesothelioma Turner syndrome Tocopherol Traumatic brain injury

question about herpes v s zits ok dumb question but i really was wondering if you squeez herpes bumps does puss come out herpes sores are filled with a clearish fluid there is no puss sometimes the sores can bleed so there can be a mixture of fluid and blood also it's a really bad idea to squeeze herpes sores this can cause them to become infected and can cause the sores to spread it's best to just leave the sores alone unless you are putting medication on them and always wash your hands after touching any herpes sore if there is puss coming out of a bump or sore then it is most likely caused by acne in the genital area or even shaving shaving the genital hair can cause ingrown hairs which can get stuck underneath the skin bacteria and puss can build up in the hair follicle  Acne Herpes simplex virus Sexually-transmitted infection Transmission (medicine) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pseudofolliculitis barbae Herpesviridae Pneumonia Intravenous therapy Oral sex Puberty Skin Cytomegalovirus Pubic hair Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Stomach cancer Group A streptococcal infection Breastfeeding Pharyngitis Shaving Psoriasis Urinary incontinence Common cold Depilation Traumatic brain injury Wound Menstrual cycle Hair Herpes zoster Conjunctivitis First aid Bleeding Body piercing Aciclovir Penis Chronic fatigue syndrome Virus Chancroid Ebola Waxing Radiation therapy HIV test Encephalitis Baldness Condom Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Chickenpox Hepatitis C Syphilis Lymphatic system AIDS reappraisal Boil Safe sex 613 mitzvot Bubonic plague Androgen insensitivity syndrome Wound healing phases Female genital cutting Scar Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female Erogenous zone Genital wart Leprosy Antibody Hepatitis Scabies Tarantula Professional wrestling match types Mange Duesberg hypothesis Baldness treatments Strap-on dildo Keratosis pilaris Infectious mononucleosis Pathogen Embalming Homeopathy Eczema Otitis externa Sebaceous gland Massage Hair color Happy Tree Friends Smallpox Old wives' tale Vulva Dialysis Bedsore Haircut Lactic acid Bacteria Mosquito Azelaic acid Polycystic ovary syndrome Anal sex Callus Beh__et's disease Antiviral drug
