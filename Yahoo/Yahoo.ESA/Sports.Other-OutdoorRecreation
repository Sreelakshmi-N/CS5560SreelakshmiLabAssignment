how to safely empty a paintball co tank i have a java oz co tank i think the guy who filled my tank screwed up and jammed or bent the pin someone told me i could fix it if i emptied the tank and played with it is there a way to do that safely at home i dont want the valve to explode or something it wont give the gun any air i said something right away the paintball field the guy let me borrow a rental tank for the rest of the day and they claimed it wasnt their fault that my brand java has faulty valves and they do that all the time java doesn't have as good of valves as say pure energy but still that pin shouldn't have done this without letting all the air out first just put a drop of oil on the valve where the pin is if it's leaking then move the pin with a small pick until it's straightened out if it will not air up the marker then something is very wrong with the tank and should be dealt with by a professional these tanks can't get very dangerous and i've had a valve shoot through a wall of out shop before so be extra cautious when handling the damaged tank for the cost of a new one though you might end up being better off just buying a new one take care and i'd seriously talk to the fields owner about the probelm  Paintball Aerial (dance move) Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Hydraulic machinery Space disaster Diving cylinder Hand grenade Carburetor Apollo 13 Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Carbon dioxide Seismic retrofit Flush toilet Gasoline Ammunition Tire Airsoft Attack on Pearl Harbor Nuclear power Thermal power station Professional wrestling throws Oxyacetylene Rebreather Rail terminology Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 M60 machine gun Circuit breaker Combine (Half-Life 2) Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 B-47 Stratojet Yohoho!

which camo to use i play airsoft and the fields i play at range from woodland to dry yellow grass what kind of camo could i buy online for or less i would suggest going with a set of woodland camo the new camo like the the digital stuff the services are using now doens't blend in all that well at close ranges the colors tend to form one hues that sticks out if you want to spend a little more look at muticam this is like sort of a digital woodland combined or try finding a set of flectar bdu's to play in but if you really want to match your surroundings check out cabela's or one of your area sports shops to see what patterns they have to offer since we don't know what exactly your area looks like it's hard to say what would be the best for my area i tend to stick with mossy oak it doe a great job of concealing a person at close range but there might be a better one for your area once you find the pattern you might be able to get your gear off of ebay or in your local paper from some person that grew out of them  Camouflage Airsoft Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater Paintball Lake District Surveillance Halo 2 Woodlands, Singapore Digital camera PlayStation Portable Wood Color space Enterprise content management Army Combat Uniform Coffee Computer Color blindness Lightsaber Nintendo GameCube Gramophone record CPU cache Battledress RGB color model Airport Deforestation Pottery Digital photography Atari 8-bit family Yosemite National Park Aikido Leaf RuneScape locations On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Upholstery Discus (fish) Color Associative array Martial art Illegal drug trade Electric guitar Bulk vending MARPAT IBM PC compatible Poker jargon NTSC Economic inequality NWo Lacrosse Native American music MUMPS Color temperature Yellow Grass, Saskatchewan FairTax Cricket Baseball Death Valley National Park Pattern matching Computer role-playing game Blood (computer game) Domestic violence Online shop Wheel of Fortune Plastic Newspaper Yellow Anchor Dither Advance fee fraud Jiuzhaigou Valley Ice hockey Hemp Manual transmission Circuit design Diamond System/34 Mushroom hunting Computer numbering formats Color theory Dune Floorball Marshall Field's Drawing Field hockey Shit Social network Amazon.com Butterfly Ty Cobb Geographic information system Postcode Loudspeaker Desert Timpani British car number plates Sudoku Final Fantasy XI Sydney Complex number Funeral

if i was to take a boat and go find an island to camp on would it be illegal it depends very much on where you are and what's going on there in most parts of the country small islands are covered by riparian rights and are considered public property and accessible to anyone unfortunately that does not protect you from some ignorant person who does not understand the law and believes the island belongs to him and has a shotgun so it can be a little bit risky also in many places if an island is ten acres or larger it can be held as private property except for the banks or beaches which are covered by riparian rights laws the safe thing is to ask around at local marinas or even better call the county sheriff or the river patrol they are usually very friendly and helpful and will know other things like where the fewest snakes are and where the fish are biting for more information do an internet search on riparian rights and always use the internet before you choose a vacation destination search for local marinas campsites and government information before you go  Public domain Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution Shark Property (ownership right) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Liberty Island Long Island Search and rescue CPU cache United States Bill of Rights Civil rights Police Grand Teton National Park Sheriff Freedom of information legislation Water police USS Tunny (SS-282) Theory of conduct Whitewater Politics of the United States Mount Sinai, New York Copyright Zion National Park Corporation Political divisions of the United States Democracy Trade union Elis Prefecture Copyright law of the United Kingdom Privacy UTF-8 Unlawful combatant P__voa de Varzim Discovery Bay Cairns, Queensland American Black Bear Separation of church and state Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Annuity American individualist anarchism Government of Ohio Gun politics Status of religious freedom in Iran Freedom of speech European Convention on Human Rights Territory of Hawaii Indian nationality law Easement Political subdivisions of New York State Refugee Trademark Counties of the United States Classified information Legal research Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Second Amendment to the United States Constitution USA PATRIOT Act Law Abortion debate Password Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 4 Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong War on Terrorism Arguments for and against drug prohibition Santa Catalina Island, California Separation of church and state in the United States Right Two Treatises of Government Marriage Copyright infringement of software Boy Scouts of America Freedom of the press Capital accumulation Shotgun Abortion in Canada River Virginia Beach, Virginia Lee County, Florida USS Atule (SS-403) Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Bras d'Or Lake International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict Breastfeeding Mineral County, West Virginia Libertarianism Anarcho-capitalism Yosemite National Park Slander and libel Eminent domain Patent Property law Isle Royale National Park Tourism United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea Hiking Trust (Law) USA Barbados Pretty Good Privacy The Dukes of Hazzard Holes (book)

when u are doing an ollie how do u get the back wheels off the ground skateboarding i have no problem getting the front wheels off but i can never get the back wheels off i have read instructions and watched people do it so many times but i still cant get it i have been practicing for a while now too the ollie is the root of most skateboard tricks it is the jump of skateboarding by popping your board and jumping you will get your board a little bit off the ground then by dragging your front foot up the board to the nose you will suck the board higher and even it out to be even with the ground this is usually the first trick you learn in skateboarding most people give up when they can't do it after a week but if you practice a lot you will be able to do it note notice how drag and dragging are bold this is because it is the most important thing in an ollie at least when you're learning place your feet as follows back foot on the tail with your little tow even with the edge of the board and the front in the middle of your board with the back foot quickly pop your foot down and snap it back up at the same time you are popping you should be dragging your front foot up the board as soon as your front foot reaches the front truck you need to put your back foot on the back trucks and push down the ground is coming so bend your knees the key word is drag you have to drag your foot up a lot of people just slam their foot as soon as they pop but you need to drag usually what happens is you learn to slam your foot down as soon as you pop i can't say enough about this because almost everyone slams you need to drag another common problem is when you pop sometimes your board doesn't get in the air because you didn't snap your foot back up you need to snap your foot back up as quick as possible this problem is easily fixable though from hear i can't tell you much more you have to practice practice practice if you're still slamming your foot and not dragging then you probably know that i feel like i'm talking to a brick wall or lamp post you need to drag if you want to get a higher ollie you have to pop quicker and drag higher on your board start small ollie hockey sticks around sticks is usually a deck high from there on you need to stack decks because it is easier to put a deck up then to put hockey sticks stacked up a good thing to start doing is ollie stairs like sets and 's and stuff like that try to ollie of high drop offs and don't be afraid try it if you have a chance that you could possibly land it remember the worst thing is not to try  Skateboarding Skateboard Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling throws Poker jargon Equine conformation Shaggy dog story Volleyball Professional wrestling holds Kitesurfing Drag racing Drill bit Diving Mouse (computing) Autogyro Wind turbine Suplex Grandview, U.S.A.

paintball gun i would like to have a longrange accurate gun without haveing to upgrade in s of dollars im thinking on a tippman or kingman spyder sonix i just want something that can shoot far accurate and not fire slowley any ideas this above answer is sketchy at most all markers do need to shoot under fps but the difference in somes stock barrel accuracy distance is pretty drastic anyone that can walk outside with a tippmann model with the stock barrel can shoot a few rounds then switch to say a evil driver and will instantly notice a difference but the buck doesn't stop there accuracy relies on the b's of paintball bolt ball barrel so an upgraded bolt with your barrel won't just help your markers efficiency but you'll gain some much needed accuracy good paint no cheap dimpled crap will fly much straighter and will have a far less chance of busting in the marker to answer your question both markers are good markers but the tippmann model is by far the better choice when it comes to its extreme reliability low cost and vast amounts of upgrades available tippmann is the only company that produces the flatline barrel system and after the fallout they had with wgp around k k with the flatline cocker they will never make another flatline system for any marker that doesn't have tippmann stamped on the side of it for distance these barrels use a back spin technology that greatly increases the paintballs distance and will flat out reach out and touch someone on the other side of the field but due to the model flatline kit they are too bulky for some peoples taste for accuracy and comfort i'd suggest sticking with a evil driver j j ceramic armson stealth smart parts progressive ect pbreview com has reviews over both of those markers along with the barrels and many other forms of gear that will help your decision take care  Paintball Internal ballistics Airsoft Firearm Shotgun Natural Selection (computer game) Machine gun Rifle Floppy disk Sniper rifle M60 machine gun Krag-J__rgensen Carbine Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Mouse (computing) Tag Sniper Handloading Universal Century Technology SA80 Equine conformation Air gun Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Terminal ballistics B-47 Stratojet Toyota Prius Springfield 1903 rifle Heckler & Koch G3 Space Shuttle program Fast bowling SKS Lee-Enfield Bubble Bobble M82 (rifle) Revolver Nintendo Hubbert peak theory Motorcycle Cheating in Counter-Strike Blackjack Hard disk Transformer Economics Comparison of 21st century fighter aircraft Mossberg 500 Submachine gun .22 Long Rifle Shell (projectile) Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Craps Central processing unit Trench warfare Messerschmitt Bf 109 M1 Carbine Chevrolet Corvair engine High explosive anti-tank Artillery Anti-aircraft warfare Supply and demand Cartridge (firearms) Shotgun shell Ammunition Kammerlader Volleyball Wild ARMs 2 AK-47 Perfect Dark M2 machine gun Nuclear weapon design Colt Commando Starsiege: Tribes Bicycle lighting Sturmgewehr 44 T-72 Accuracy International AWM Archery M4 Carbine Zerg GLOCK Motion capture Golf club (equipment) Eyepiece Loudspeaker Suppressor Energy development Halo: Combat Evolved

scuba diving question if your on vacation to florida and you want to try scuba diving do you have to take some kind of classes inorder to dive or do you just pay money and the divers take you on an adventure most resorts offer a course to expose you to scuba it ususally entails a dive in the pool to familiarize you with the equipment and then a brief closely supervised dive in the ocean if you want to get certified i would recommend doing your classroom work before you go and then completing your open water dives with a florida dive shop when you go on vacation  Diver training Diving Scuba diving Scuba set Professional Association of Diving Instructors Decompression sickness Diving suit British Sub Aqua Club Diving regulator Diving cylinder Diving equipment Timeline of underwater technology Dive computer Drowning Epcot SS Andrea Doria Lifeguard Tourism Buoyancy compensator Breathing gas Anti-frogman techniques Diving at the 2004 Summer Olympics Hotel Diver rescue Barotrauma Nitrogen narcosis Decompression stop Diving locations Bocas del Toro Province Palawan Full face diving mask Buoy Submarine Buddy system Thunderball Parachuting Jacques-Yves Cousteau Audrey Mestre HMS M2 Technical diving Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Cayman Islands Enriched Air Nitrox Byron Bay, New South Wales Steven Curtis Chapman Siebe Gorman Walt Disney World Resort Robert Ballard Snorkel Decompression buoy Woodville Karst Plain Project Civil Air Patrol Bora Bora Siebe Gorman CDBA Swimfin Las Vegas Strip Fluid pressure Education in the People's Republic of China Disneyland Kish, Iran Diver Propulsion Vehicle Swimming pool Fishing Laurel Clark Hurghada Moalboal, Cebu Orlando, Florida Farne Islands Tarpon Springs, Florida USS Atule (SS-403) Abalone Academia Caraga Key West, Florida Homeschooling Bomb disposal Seabird Tourism in Hawaii Sperm Whale Walt Disney World College Program Probation officer The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Cape Town Education in Japan Cura__ao CSS H.

i want to incorperate high adventure sports into a career im thinking about writing for a magazine like national geographic any other ideas does anyone know what the salary for that would be most writers reporting on high adventure sports are free lance journalists who are paid by assignment this is even true for major magazines like the geographic only very few would be salaried staff writers as in any type of published writing the payment depends on the stature and circulation of the magazine and the skill and reputation of the writer so you could be looking at anywhere from zero payment to 's of dollars per article in a way it is like being and actor or a musician only the very best writers can support themselves well by only writing about sports most also have another type of related work as backup such as photography or guiding i have known two wilderness sports free lance writers who worked as manufacturer's sales reps for outdoor gear if you look in most magazines like national geographic and outside they will have little blurbs in the front of the magazine with information about the writers of articles in the issue reading those could help give you some ideas as to how they got to the level where such publications would hire them to write pieces it's important to not only be an excellent writer but to have an in depth knowledge about the sports you plan to cover to be willing to travel a lot at a moment's notice under often rough conditions and to be able to meet deadlines under pressure if this is something you really feel you could be good at it you should plan to take college courses in writing and journalism to hone your skills to build a portfolio of published work i would also recommend joining one or more local clubs for the sports that interest you surfing skiing climbing etc and then submitting articles about their events to their newsletters you won't get paid to start off with but they are usually happy to have free articles and it will give you a chance to get practice and to appear in print this will help you get jobs eventually also going to events like the mountain film festivals in telluride colorado every memorial day weekend and in banff alberta early november will give you a chance to meet some of the top people who write about extreme adventure sports it would be a challenging career if you've got the talent and drive for it good luck  The Standard Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Minor league baseball Newspaper Adventure racing Plame affair Skiing Sports Illustrated National Football League Magazine Nintendo Power Screenplay Extreme Programming Microeconomics Yearbook Experiential education UK Singles Chart Copyright Education in the United States Education in Japan 2004-05 NHL lockout Education in the People's Republic of China Ming Pao Weekly newspaper GED Hunter College High School Peer review Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Public domain Charles Dickens Salary cap Electronic Arts Colorado Tax Columbine High School massacre Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution ELO rating system Trademark Boy Scouts of America Professional sports Oxford English Dictionary Publishing Mutual fund Equine conformation Air traffic controller HK Magazine Edmonton, Alberta Management Kyoto Protocol Car handling Am730 Game programmer Paragliding Boston College New York Giants Norway national football team Gliding Legal research Mountaineering Student loan RuneScape Inflation Transport Workers Union of America Science fiction magazine Michael D.

what is a good hiking compass to buy i need to purchase a compass for hiking and i want it to be affordable but not a piece of crap any suggestions look for a large liquid filled capsule for the needle it will settle quickly get the kind with a plastic backing plate a bright color is always smart to avoid leaving it behind put a lanyard on it when in constant use you'll put it in your shirt pocket and make it long enough to go around your neck for the late night walk out to the bushes which is when many people get lost rounded corners are nice especially for women this way you can tuck it into your shirt when no pocket is available and it won't swing around banging an adjustable declination compensation is handy but if you do math in your head it is not needed and if you don't do precise work it is a bit extra consider this an advanced feature buck will get you a nice unit and for beginners a unit from silva works great avoid the lensatic engineer's and little ones  Aerial (dance move) Equine conformation Carburetor Craps Compass Poker jargon Textile manufacturing Knife Mattress Hiking The Inside Strap-on dildo Drill bit Clarinet 1957 World Series Internal ballistics 2000 Australian Grand Prix Upholstery New England Patriots Gramophone record Chess strategy and tactics Scuba set Humphrey Bogart Softball Shirt Sundial Violin Punch card Ayrton Senna Oscilloscope Glossary of nautical terms Animal Crossing The Amber Spyglass Weight training Fischer Random Chess Dice Plastic Professional wrestling throws Yohoho!
