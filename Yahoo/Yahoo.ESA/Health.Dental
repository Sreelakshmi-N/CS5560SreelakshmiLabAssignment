dental generational change i took my yr old son to the dentist a year and a half ago and had to put in three stainless crowns as well as a root canal under one of them today i took my year old in for what was supposed to be a preventative filling on a sugar bug a spot which looked like it might turn into a cavity she required a baby root canal a pulpectomy or something with sedation it'a been explained to me that kids' teeth explode into cavities once the surface is broken so i didn't give my younger one the gummie fruit snacks or the sticky candies my older one had i have not been great with brushing but it's a battle every day and the dentists tell you not to traumatize them yet get it done my question is why did we the parent now generation have fillings and not all this reparational work i had cavities by the time i was or so but i ate lots of candy and brushed like crap why are my kids needing root canals and crowns before they're is it flouride in the water and it's not just my kids two of my friends' kids have had or mors cavities in the last year that required sedation for filling thanks i guess i'm frustrated because the only crown i've had was because i got my first crown in my 's when i cracked a tooth on popcorn what is up my friends are all die hard kid brushers and we all go to different pediatric dentists to lemoncake if you come back it was phrased to me to keep the tooth we need to clean out the decay and crown it i believe that because apparently the decay was so bad one they got in there was not enough tooth to just fill eeek dentistry has changed dramatioacally with an emphasis on prevention but i think it is important to let your dentist know your concerns and what you as a parent consumer are willing to accept don't be afraid to decline services that may not be absolutely necessary you can always change to a dentist who is more supportive of your views and concerns i am sure most dentists are scrupulous but like all service professionals dentists are looking for every opportunity to increase billings that's just the truth it may be 'advised' to purchase a certain service but is it really necessary ask lots of questions and don't be satisfied unless you get answers that make sense to you be a smart consumer  Tooth enamel Dentistry The Dentist Fluoride therapy Bulk vending Methamphetamine Oral hygiene Dental brace Crown (dentistry) Root canal Dental fillings Procrastination Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Medical prescription Gingivitis Economics Electrophysiology Bruxism Dental floss Empire Burlesque Microeconomics Breastfeeding Poker jargon Password G-Man (Half-Life) Wood Drill bit Humphrey Bogart 2000 Australian Grand Prix Casting Raisin Ex-gay National Health Service History of the British constitution Plame affair Dentures Discordianism The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Surveillance Craps Flood geology RuneScape cheats Medicine Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Kyle Broflovski Glen Jacobs Peter Griffin Last Exit to Springfield Traumatic brain injury Hangul Milton H.

how long do i need to wait to get a partial denture i had some teeth extracted april th and wonder how long i need to wait until my mouth is healed enough to get an upper partial as my dentist has not told me anything yet and not having teeth is driving me crazy i'm wondering why your dentist did not fit you with an immediate partial when you were having your teeth extracted i feel that it is better to have an immediate done for a couple of obvious reasons you have your partial with the missing teeth already to wear and it helps to hold the sutures and clots that will form after the extractions by applying pressure against your gums now if the teeth that were removed were not in the front then this could have been the reasoning for not doing an immediate partial but still a temporary partial could have been made and put in after the extractions to hold open the spaces from the teeth that were pulled and worn until the gums healed to get the new permanent partial but healing time is weeks you should have had your partial by now unless there is a financial reasoning behind your not having them already good luck  Tooth Dentistry Crown (dentistry) Wisdom teeth Dental caries Tooth enamel Dental brace Oral hygiene Certified Nursing Assistant The Dentist Bruxism Gingivitis Chewing gum Maxilla Tetrapod Internal ballistics Drill bit Mouth ulcer Dental implant Orthodontics Tattoo Tire Body piercing Siphon Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Bubblegum Suture Enzyme Babe Ruth Mandible Handloading Earring Manual transmission Gag (BDSM) Social rule Breastfeeding Knife Negima Aloe Charles Goodyear Tongue piercing Glen Jacobs Ammonite Carpal tunnel syndrome Mojave people Equine conformation Condom Screw Horse tack The Contender (television series) Roller chain Halitosis Oz (TV series) Casting Endocarditis Minor characters in Seinfeld Plastic Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma United Kingdom corporation tax Mouthpiece Naruto jutsu Traumatic brain injury Good Times Happy Tree Friends Kodocha Stomach cancer Eucalyptus Medical prescription Tobacco The Jazz Singer Dialysis Scar Dental floss Salad Fingers Sperm Whale Car handling West Side Highway Place of articulation Vulcanization Oral cancer Motorcycle The Amazing Race Freddie Mercury Kurt Angle Bong Diving suit Vernon Schillinger Tractor Jet engine Microeconomics Copyleft Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Poker jargon Gear ratio Lost City (Stargate SG-1) Drowning Revolver

i'm getting braces tomorrow and i'm really nervous what happens in the orthodontist office and does it hurt okay for me i had them done on both top and bottom they put spacers in between my molars and that was just the elastic that went in between my molars to make room for the metal band like things that went around my molars it hurt a little at first and then it only started to hurt more and more i hated that part so much as one came out and it only hurt more when the metal was put on because the teeth hadn't moved all the way to make room for the metal bit secondly they put a red thing in my mouth that pinched my cheeks so i wouldn't close my mouth and my teeth would stay dry after that you can't feel a thing but the red thing stays in for a while untill everything is in and in place i remembered it didn't hurt at all untill after make sure to ask for wax because without wax your teeth move and it presses against your cheeks and it rubs and hurts so wax ask for that have lip gloss or lip chap on hand because your lips have to move over the braces and licking your lips isn't as easy as it sounds so hope this helps it only hurts after i promise you that but there was no drill that was involved or things like that good luck and don't pick green or yellow  Dental brace Drill bit Shaggy dog story Casting Nine Inch Nails Skateboarding trick Tooth Equine conformation Orthodontics Hangul Blood on the Tracks Social rule 1957 World Series Breastfeeding The Adventures of Pete & Pete Piccolo Junior Saga Gag (BDSM) Kim Possible Mnemonic Cosmetics Textile manufacturing Muslim ibn Aqeel Embouchure Jon Secada Knife 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Aerial (dance move) Theory of conduct Oral sex Hip hop rivalries 2000 Australian Grand Prix Time Out of Mind Lip balm Maxilla Memento (film) Harmonica Cat The Dentist Humphrey Bogart Ed, Edd n Eddy Barbed wire Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Saxophone Evidence of evolution The Contender (television series) Queen (band) Characters of Naruto Trumpet Book of Isaiah Procrastination Samuel Goldwyn Dental caries The Legend of Zelda series enemies Salad Fingers Maison Ikkoku H__sker D__ Missouri Compromise Shadow the Hedgehog AFI 100 Years series Budd Dwyer Bon Jovi Tobacco Horse tack Dog training 2004 American League Championship Series Late Night with Conan O'Brien Chopsticks Darken Rahl The Fairly OddParents Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Satchel Paige Frankie Vaughan Milton H.

hairline fracture in tooth cap i had one of my teeth capped a few years it suddenly shattered and i was left with a stump i had an excellent and extremely natural put in its placed but of today it suddenly began to crack i can see a small hairline fracture running up the cap it actually goes all the way around i do not know how deep the fracture is will i ultimately have to have a whole new cap put in its place most likely you will need to get a new crown unfortunatly when you have a crack in the crown it makes it weak and fragile you can have a lot of sensitivity when there is a crack in the crown bacteria can also get through the crack and eat at the tooth that is underneath the crown and if that happens then you got even worse problems cause you most likely you will need to get a root canal or possibly have to have it extracted it you let it go too long so my advice to you is to go to your dentist only he can tell you for sure if that is what really going on good luck  Dental caries Tooth Dentistry Equine conformation Glacier Hip fracture Fast bowling Drill bit Hair Crown (dentistry) Plastic Diamond cut Wisdom teeth Baldness European Beech Semiconductor device Glass Mandible Bruxism Root canal Methamphetamine Hamster Enceladus (moon) Halitosis Ultraviolet Abiogenic petroleum origin New Zealand cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Maxilla Ammolite Bryan Robson Eczema Ty Cobb Valles Marineris 2000 Australian Grand Prix Fatigue (material) Poker jargon Cheese Hitler's death Breastfeeding Pneumonia Diamond Fracture mechanics Collecting fossils Traumatic brain injury Characters in the Smurfs The Fairly OddParents Water Second Battle of the Atlantic Password Raisin Moss Piccolo Junior Saga Diamond enhancement Turquoise Weathering Alkane Brittle Guinea pig Knife Sandworm (Dune) Brewery FoxTrot Carnivorous plant Dental fillings Oral sex Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Humerus New York Giants Password cracking Fracture USS Yorktown (CV-5) Bone fracture Tyrannosaurus rex Ted Williams Honey fungus Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Material properties of diamond Cocaine Gypsy moth Luck Dairy Domestic rabbit Horseshoe The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Dentist Erosion Turner syndrome Ice core Europa (moon) Wood Orthodontics Rail tracks The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Cryonics Pterosaur Metroid (video game species) Hal Trosky Dead Sea

wisdom teeth issues is it really painful for non impacted wisdom teeth growing in i don't think my wisdom teeth are impacted at all i can see the crown growing up i think is it was growing in sideways or if it was impacted then the crown wouldn't be showing or it would be shown pushing against the nearby tooth but it isn't i think the pain is coming from how the tooth is growing in i think its growing in normal but unsure if theres enough room the tooth is growing up into unsure what the name of the tissue is you know the very back where the wisdom tooth grows theres an arch and a lot of flesh that looks like cheek issue where the gums seem to end well my tooth is pushing that cheek issue in the archway and its growing in a spot and making room i guess its turning the flesh in the back white like stretch marks and its making it wrinkled its just really painful ibprofen only makes the pain somewhat bareable its been days of contact pain there is no infection im sure salt water and bakign soda are useless any ideas if this is normal for growing right yes this sounds very normal teething hurts just ask a baby try to keep it very clean brush across that tissue and make sure to floss the backside of the last molar down under the gumline the only thing i can suggest is to keep the ibuprofen in your system you might try aleve because it is less medicine to take get some freeze pops and chew on them either closed or open just make sure you are chewing with that area this is to numb it you might get some ambesol otc as a temporary numbing solution not much you can do really except get them extracted good luck  Tooth Dental caries Cocaine Halitosis Breastfeeding Elephant Carpal tunnel syndrome Domestic rabbit The Wall First aid Characters of Naruto Fancy rat Dental brace Oral hygiene Dental floss Tooth enamel Dog training Cat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Gingivitis Dentistry Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Equine conformation Tetrapod Twelve Swords of Power Milton H.

is vitrebond necessary for filling my dentist suggust vitrebond for filling cost is per teeth for vitrebond what is it is it safe is the cost justfied vitrebond is used as a lining in large fillings the procedure would be considered an indirect pulp cap which just means the cavity is getting close to the nerve so before placing the filling they would use a layer of vitrebond if the doctor recommended using it i would let him you could have it done without but that may cause you problems later vitrebond releases fluoride to help protect the tooth and nerve the cost is pretty standard it is safe and it will reduce the possibility of needing a root canal on that tooth in the future hope this helps if you have any more questions feel free to send me a message  Tooth Dental caries Tooth enamel Dentistry Root canal Fluoride therapy Maxilla Temporal bone Dental fillings Chronic fatigue syndrome Multiple sclerosis Mach kernel Public-key cryptography Fecal incontinence Nuclear power Microeconomics Hubble Space Telescope Urinary incontinence Fluoride Nine Inch Nails Pretty Good Privacy Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Oral hygiene Local anesthesia Single Transferable Vote Mandible Crown (dentistry) Poker jargon Objective-C RSA Dental brace One-time pad Hamster Crocodilia Lung Computer security Fugu Tocopherol Brain Toothpaste Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma DragonFly BSD Solar power satellite Space Shuttle program Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Incident Command System Growth hormone treatment Pneumonia Information Technology Infrastructure Library Breastfeeding Carpal tunnel syndrome Trigeminal nerve Clinical depression Malaria C plus plus CPU cache Ivory Scientology beliefs and practices Floppy disk Hydrogen peroxide Panama Canal Traumatic brain injury Prostate cancer Solar cell Normal distribution Health insurance Stem cell Autonomic nervous system Medical prescription X Window System Houseplant Mesothelioma Hand grenade PNG Fluorine Electrolyte Extreme Programming Corrosion Tyrannosaurus rex First aid Mouth ulcer Migraine Plastic Stomach cancer Fusion power Filling station Fancy rat Advertising Explosive material Facial nerve Wood E-mail U.S. presidential election, 2000 Ethmoid bone Acupuncture National Health Service Energy development Inguinal hernia Tooth development Sleep apnea

how to relieve the pain of sensitive teeth without having to go to see the dentist last time i went to see the dentist i had one injection and never went back after that i have a really painful sensitive tooth in the back of my mouth i always use sensodyne toothpaste which does help but sometimes it becomes very painful again samantha hot and cold does seem to make it worse and i needed to have the injection to numb the pain but when i was about to have the treatment done i panicked after looking at the drill and didn't go through with it in the end you will dislike my answer but reading your question made me clear that you must see the dentist you can not postpone it or you will feel worse believe me i have been in this situation but an injection is nothing compared to tooth extraction root canal i hope i have spelled it correctly tooth engraving and the pain what kills you you have a serious problem you must see the doctor i am sorry to say this but there is no heroism in your current behavior though i can understand you don't like dentists and their practice but now you are in the case of emergency and this overwrites your fears or no i can not e mail you through yahoo answers i wanted to suggest something in regard of your other question the lady who stalks you  Dentistry Dental caries Tooth Mouth ulcer Scientology beliefs and practices Stomach cancer Milton H.

anyone had a cavity filled by laser tell me 'bout it it isn't bad it's just like a normal filling but they use a laser instead of a drill supposedly the laser doesn't directly stimulate the nerve endings so it hurts less for me that was true at first but for repeated fillings don't think it was on the same tooth it felt just like a regular drill the worst part of it is that your dentist will want to pay for the very expensive laser drill as quickly as possible so it will cost more than a regular filling those machines run about k and the bill is something like more at least for mine but insurance took care of it so i didn't see much of a price difference  Tooth Laserdisc Drill bit Dental fillings Health insurance Procrastination Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Oral hygiene Publicly funded medicine Life insurance Laser Casting Modelocking Normal distribution Inertial guidance system Theory of conduct Root canal The Price Is Right Floppy disk Microeconomics Canadian and American health care systems compared Diamond clarity Paintball Growth hormone treatment Laser diode GunBound Dentistry Evan Mecham Inflation Canada Health Act Peter Griffin The Dentist Carbon dioxide After War Era technology Denji Sentai Mega Ranger Glen Jacobs Medical malpractice Cincinnati Bengals Upholstery Prostate cancer Strap-on dildo Education in the United States Wal-Mart Nine Inch Nails Blackjack Printed circuit board Babe Ruth Asbestos Fusion power Population inversion Mutual fund FairTax Philosophical skepticism CPU design Welding PostScript Temporal bone Adverse selection Goodness and value theory Laser engraving Doomtown Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Mach kernel Poker jargon M16 (rifle) Metalworking Apple II family Law of value Radio Yerevan Barbara Boxer Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Weebl and Bob Diamonds Are Forever Neon Genesis Evangelion glossary Commodore International MIPS architecture Methamphetamine Terran (StarCraft) Health care in the United States Economics Homestar Runner Erogenous zone Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ford Motor Company National Health Service Future energy development Pittsburgh Steelers Deflation (economics) Firefighter Combine (Half-Life 2) Outsourcing Bart chalkboard gags Economy of the Republic of Ireland Tooth enamel Nuclear power True Crime: Streets of LA Team Fortress Classic Pok__mon Live!

what is the usual price for a root canal i live in northern vermont hi i've been in dentistry for over years this depends on which tooth is being done a single root tooth like your six front teeth is less than the molars most root canals done by an endodontist are even more but you may be happier with the results the average root canal for a molar tooth in new england is approx this does not include the restorative that must be done to build up the tooth and then restore it it is a costly procedure but must be done to save the tooth often loosing teeth begins a domino effect and other teeth will follow as they shift out of place and the one above that drops the best thing is the rct or extraction and implant about the same cost marie  Root canal Dental caries Tooth enamel Tooth Maxilla Mandible Fluoride therapy Explosive material Crown (dentistry) Microeconomics Dental implant Surgery Domestic rabbit Gold Cosmetic dentistry Stem cell Dentures Orthodontics Molar mass distribution Dental fillings Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Wisdom teeth CPU cache Drill bit Speed of light Concentration Periodontal ligament Economics Nine Inch Nails Evolution of the Horse X86 assembly language The Dentist Chronic fatigue syndrome 2000 Australian Grand Prix Normal distribution Monopoly Digital circuit Boston and Lowell Railroad Gross domestic product Medical analysis of circumcision Seawolf (fish) Information Technology Infrastructure Library Cocaine Medicine Tooth bleaching Wind turbine Siegfried Line Oral hygiene 10th Princess Mary's Own Gurkha Rifles Dead Sea 28 (number) Place of articulation Supply and demand Daylight saving time Embouchure UK Singles Chart DDT (professional wrestling) Perfume Oral and maxillofacial surgery Nutmeg Dentition Deflation (economics) History of the British canal system Elephant Real estate economics Lichfield Heat Inflation Textile manufacturing Dominoes Twisted Metal Hyperinflation Gray Wolf Cardiac arrhythmia Economy of Russia Napier's bones Synthesizer Macropod Face The Drifters Iditarod Quartic equation Cat Copula Juris Doctor Tooth fairy Deinotherium Sugar beet Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Liquorice Gastrointestinal tract Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Parliament of the United Kingdom Growth hormone treatment View camera Indus Valley Civilization Even-toed ungulate Raw food diet

invisalign does invisalign give good results would u recommend it how good is invisalign compared to metal braces advantages the main advantage of the treatment is cosmetic the aligners are completely transparent and difficult to detect this makes the method particularly popular among adults who want to straighten their teeth without the unflattering look of traditional metal braces which are commonly worn by children and adolescents in addition the aligners are marketed as being more comfortable than braces according to the company invisalign aligners are more comfortable than metal braces as they may not irritate the soft tissue of the mouth as much as traditional braces due to the removable nature of the device various food types can be enjoyed without the encumbrance of metallic braces disadvantages despite the considerable cosmetic advantage of invisalign the product also has many disadvantages the very fact that the aligners are removable means they are not continually correcting the teeth they are largely dependent on a patient's habits and their consistency in wearing the aligners with fixed braces the treatment is also dependent on patient compliance the aligners must be removed for eating they and the teeth should be cleaned before re inserting afterwards this can be troublesome for people who are constantly snacking and may mean the patient has to clean their teeth up to six times daily however this tends to discourage snacking which some people might find useful this is the same for patients with fixed braces as with traditional braces if a patient grinds or clenches his or her teeth during the day or while sleeping the aligners or braces can become damaged in these cases a new aligner may be required or it may be suggested that a patient switch to a metal retainer also aligners or braces may cause a slight lisp at the beginning of treatment however this lisp also usually comes along with the traditional metal braces this usually disappears as the patient becomes used to the treatment  Orthodontics Drill bit Tooth Carpal tunnel syndrome Dental caries Intravenous therapy Hypoglycemia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Domestic rabbit Urinary incontinence Tooth enamel Acne Cancer Coeliac disease Prostate cancer Stomach cancer Scoliosis Contact lens Hamster Breastfeeding Sleep apnea Scar Androgen insensitivity syndrome Epilepsy Growth hormone treatment Malignant melanoma Equine conformation Associative array Breast cancer Lung cancer Fecal incontinence Stroke Sewage treatment Chronic fatigue syndrome Colorectal cancer View camera Tattoo Hearing impairment Slide rule Acromegaly Bulk vending Radiation therapy Table saw Radiosurgery Dentistry Plastic surgery Intersex surgery Traumatic brain injury Mattress Medicine Floppy disk Land mine Psoriasis Stereoscopy Cascading Style Sheets Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Crohn's disease Earring Drug test Surveillance Adjustable gastric band Folic acid Dentures Transsexuality Stuttering Antiretroviral drug Bipolar disorder Menstrual cup Bruxism Redundant array of independent disks Oral hygiene Gastroesophageal reflux disease Scheme programming language Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Trimipramine History of intersex surgery Cephalic disorder Typewriter Female genital cutting Cocaine Diabetes mellitus Medical analysis of circumcision Intensive insulinotherapy Indent style Prolactinoma Paget's disease of bone Osteoarthritis Hydrogen peroxide Insulin Paracetamol Allergy Gas metal arc welding

why is rubbing salt on your teeth good i just want to know becasue ive been foing it and i dont want it to hurt my teeth and make my breath smell bad becasue people tell me it helps whitten your teeth this is a good method of keeping your teeth sparkling clean because it removes plaque with the combination of friction from your toothbrush i also read that if you try adding a little water and baking soda to the salt it will be very effective in whitening your teeth  Toothpaste Tooth Tooth enamel Toothbrush Oral hygiene Cocaine Halitosis Bread Vinegar Mouth ulcer Carbon dioxide Drill bit Textile manufacturing Skunk Chewing gum Dental floss Microeconomics Sodium Dentures Bong Dental caries First aid Champagne (beverage) Water purification Hydrochloric acid Jala neti Ice cream Hydrogen peroxide Flour Diving Sodium carbonate Hamster Friction Shark Carbonated water Cyanide Psoriasis Lionel Corporation Fishing Acetic acid Dentistry Oral sex Listerine Fluoride therapy Water Sinfest Chocolate Justification (theology) Urine Cast iron Baking powder Methamphetamine Ammonia Dishwasher Nasal irrigation Happy Tree Friends Jewish cuisine Edible salt Internal ballistics Fluoride Rebreather Tooth bleaching Atomic Kitten Drowning Audio data compression Ham Nutmeg Hydrogen chloride Theory of conduct Salt Plastic Glass Hydroponics Tetrapod Knife Soap Risotto Atherosclerosis Kosher foods RuneScape Mini-Games Full face diving mask Hyperthermia Peanut butter Mint Unemployment Motor oil Electric motor Electrolyte Wine Cake Pottery 1,4-dichlorobenzene Sulfuric acid Soy protein Soda lime Potato chips Gag (BDSM) Tattoo

should you get your wisdom teeth pulled right when they're starting to grow you can get your wisdom teeth pulled as young as they dont have to be out an oral surgeon can cut into your gum and take them out there is actually a few less complications with that then when they are completely out and then you have to have them pulled you should have your wisdom teeth out right away because if you let them grow all the way out they can crowd your teeth and make them crooked or can be uncomfortable only if they are growing in at an angle the sooner the better  Tooth Dental brace Dentistry Saw Sawfiler Leaf Oral hygiene Dental caries Dentures Drill bit Gingivitis Halitosis Unsafe sexual practices Tetrapod Tongue piercing Chris Benoit Orthodontics Oral sex Chewing gum Cleft Chainsaw Richard Rahl Wire Tobacco Surgery Dental implant Periodontal ligament Professional wrestling holds Methamphetamine Electroconvulsive therapy Tooth enamel Cattle Knife Gear Gray Wolf Oral cancer Maxilla Pubic hair Milton H.

what does it feel like getting your wisdom teeth pulled im so scared i heard about wisdom teeth and how they're big and everyone has to get them pulled out and i'm really scared does it hurt do they put you to sleep or do you just sit there while someone's trying to wrench out two of your teeth when i was in my early twenties i had both my wisdom teeth taken out at the bottom of my mouth i was terrified to be honest but i was sedated and frankly i went straight to sleep and had to be woken up they give another sedative to knock you out until way after the operation is over with they also numb your gums before extracting so pain is not felt at all during the procedure or indeed for a while afterwards you will be given painkillers and antibiotics too for maybe a week afterwards basically don't worry mine was a very comfortable and positive experience and my gums had to be cut to remove the teeth because they were severely tilting onto my other teeth please don't worry you will need someone to take you home afterwards though and probably will just sleep for a while afterwards too but on the other hand if you need your wisdom teeth extraction is a simple manner of just local numbing and extraction then that hurts a lot less and heals a lot quicker also straight growing wisdom teeth are apparently quite easy to remove if needed to be that's what my dentist said last time i saw him need the tops one done soon most importantly though the age of extraction varies wildly from person to person and frankly if they will only be removed if they are causing a problem and in some people they never have to be removed just because they are there does not automatically mean they are a problem or indeed that they need removing let your dentists advise you on this but if its not been mentioned then you probably don't need to worry about this as yet good luck  Dentistry Wisdom teeth Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breastfeeding Manual transmission Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Carpal tunnel syndrome Diving Chronic fatigue syndrome Shaggy dog story Bruxism Dental caries Milton H.

is there any other way im and my teeth i've been noticing are slowly moving apart from eachother it never was like this before and i was wanting to get braces to fix them up is there any other way to get them to stick back together other than having to get braces thank youu does it hurt to get that it's not a quick solution but you'll be growing more molars in so your teeth might push forward then also after you're or so the dentist could do a procedure that caps your teeth making the caps a little bigger than your natural teeth are filling in the spaces they can't do this until your teeth have stopped growing though so you have a few years to wait just a note that might not make any difference to you but jewel the singer said in an interview once that she wanted to have her one crooked tooth fixed and her fans booed her and wrote her begging her not to do it they loved her look because she didn't look like everything other barbie doll pop star and when leanne rhymes got her teeth fixed so she didn't have a gap anymore she lost the one thing that made her uniquely beautiful now she just looks like everyone else and if nothing else it's easy for you to floss right now whatever you choose good luck  Dental brace Tooth Dental caries Super Mario 64 Ed, Edd n Eddy Dentistry Tooth enamel The Fairly OddParents Shaggy dog story Richard Rahl Quarashi Characters in the Smurfs Billboard Hot 100 Nine Inch Nails Piccolo Junior Saga Skateboarding trick Jennifer Lopez Cliff Richard Kodocha Spice Girls Oral hygiene Poker jargon Aquarium (album) One Tree Hill (TV series) Aerial (dance move) Jon Secada A Day in the Life Kim Possible Journey (band) Carpal tunnel syndrome Milton H.

i have wisdom teeth that came out crooked should i get them extracted tell me your experiences the crooked ones are the bottom another one came out perfect and the th one hasn't come out yet and i'm when i was in my early twenties i had both my wisdom teeth taken out at the bottom of my mouth i was terrified to be honest but i was sedated and frankly i went straight to sleep and had to be woken up they give another sedative to knock you out until way after the operation is over with they also numb your gums before extracting so pain is not felt at all during the procedure or indeed for a while afterwards you will be given painkillers and antibiotics too for maybe a week afterwards basically don't worry mine was a very comfortable and positive experience and my gums had to be cut to remove the teeth because they were severely tilting onto my other teeth please don't worry you will need someone to take you home afterwards though and probably will just sleep for a while afterwards too but on the other hand if you need your wisdom teeth extraction is a simple manner of just local numbing and extraction then that hurts a lot less and heals a lot quicker also straight growing wisdom teeth are apparently quite easy to remove if needed to be that's what my dentist said last time i saw him need the tops one done soon most importantly though the age of extraction varies wildly from person to person and frankly if they will only be removed if they are causing a problem and in some people they never have to be removed just because they are there does not automatically mean they are a problem or indeed that they need removing let your dentists advise you on this good luck  Tooth Wisdom teeth Dentistry Manual transmission Breastfeeding Chronic fatigue syndrome Dental brace Bruxism Dental caries Carpal tunnel syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mouth ulcer Theory of conduct Domestic rabbit Oral sex Oral hygiene Diving Cocaine Anesthesia Certified Nursing Assistant Dentures Adjustable gastric band Dialysis First aid Diazepam Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Traumatic brain injury Final Fantasy magic Chlorpromazine Grief Halitosis Sleep Bondage (BDSM) Methamphetamine Drill bit Endocarditis Social rule Female genital cutting Perl Hangul Hypnosis Guinea pig Socrates Milton H.

dental advice how long should fillings in between the teeth take i am years old i just had a baby months ago i went to the dentist today and he should that i have six very small cavities in between my back teeth they are going to use the resin tooth colored fillings however he said that it will take one hour per cavity i think that is silly i have never had work done on my teeth before does this sound about right should i get a second opinion and does anyone know how much fillings cost approximately i am starting to think since he wants to do the work in to different visits maybe he is just trying to get more money in visits cleaning exam etc help oh and after the cleaning and the exam i am in some pain is that normal thanks for responding terrified of the dentist in hawaii crystal to start with use warm salt water rinses to ease the soreness your experiencing sorry about that as for the fillings he has planned the composites being placed in between the teeth of molars can take some time to place and finish first he must numb you which takes a few minutes then he will need to excavate the decay clean the area and place a band that will retain the material and help to shape and contour the tooth then the tooth will be etching and rinsing thoroughly adhesive applied and then the restoration can be placed after it's cured he can then adjust the bite and polish the restoration so it will be smooth to your tongue the composite materials take a little more time to do but are esthetically pleasing and last just as long as the amalgams when he says it will take an hour for a filling and has planned several appointments for these he is probably saving you from being numb on both sides upper and lower in one visit what you've described is normal for interproximal restorations be glad he's being considerate and scheduling you for different appointments for each side rather than trying to do them all at once it sounds to me like you have a good dentist and should trust his sound judgment regarding your dental care i hope i've been of some help and good luck with your pending procedures cost for composite restorations vary from dentist to dentist and city to city but most all one surface restorations are approximately and up your case will most likely be a two surface and somewhere around per tooth additional information although you have what he considers or appears to be small areas of decay they may look that way on your x rays and with a visual exam but the only way of knowing how small is once he is in the tooth excavating the soft decay leaving you with a sound solid tooth structure to restore in other words the decayed areas may be larger than what's anticipated and he may be allowing more time for what is unexpected but possible so that you aren't alarmed being in the chair for longer than what you expected  Dentistry Dental brace Tooth enamel Fluoride therapy Dental fillings Domestic rabbit Mouth ulcer First aid Wood Crown (dentistry) Casting Mattress Dentures Maxilla Urinary incontinence Mandible Cosmetic dentistry Bruxism Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Dentist Violin Knife Enceladus (moon) Halitosis Massage Dialysis Terri Schiavo Cocaine Hoover Dam Saxophone Hubble Space Telescope Radio controlled airplane Methamphetamine Root canal Dishwasher Multiple sclerosis Friction Prostate cancer Medical prescription Manicure Seismic retrofit Wisdom teeth Plastic Breastfeeding Place of articulation Strap-on dildo Electrophysiology Glacier Vowel Hamster Great Pyramid of Giza Tetrapod Nuclear fallout Hangul Brewery Diamond Gingivitis Equine conformation Mercury (element) Japanese tea ceremony Paint Textile manufacturing Cast iron Laserdisc Solar cell Tyrannosaurus rex Orthodontics San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Pottery Mars Exploration Rover Ultraviolet Daylight saving time Turquoise Carburetor Dental hygienist Stereoscopy Supreme Court of the United States Acupuncture Medicine Calixarene Chair Cat Tide Lunar Prospector

will it hurt or what braces okay so i got the brackets and the spacers i got them yesterday so i m going back on the th and the th i think they're taking the spacers out on the th and well i m wondering will taking out the spacers hurt as much as putting them in or will it be like not be painfull at all also i dont have the wires yet or anything so will it hurt when they put the wires and the little metal thing around the teeth where the spacers are in oh and um the lady was saying i hope she doesnt have cavity's so they found out i had like which is really that bad at all will they fix it or somthing or no as far as i remember taking spacers out don't hurt when they put the bands around your teeth though it does feel weird kind of scrapey and tight while they're putting it on and sometimes it pinches your gums when they get it all the way down tell them if it hurts and they should be able to adjust it for you also those bands have a little thing that sticks out towards your cheeks which is where the wire attaches to at the ends those little things that stick out and scratch at your cheeks and hurt for the first few days be sure and ask for dental orthodontic wax to cover them up to reduce irritation they'll show you how to use it it's really easy and totally worth using it'll save you lots of ouchy cheeks as far as the wire itself goes it doesn't really hurt but it does feel weird it feels like pressure or pulling in the next few hours days it will be sore make sure your parents get you some tylenol or advil to take in case you'd like a pain reliever you may want to take one before your appointment to lessen any uncomfortable sensations you may experience after everything is installed depending on where the cavity is they'll want to fix it before the braces go fully on that way it's easier to reach and less cumbersome of a procedure once you've got all the parts of the braces on dental work gets that much more complicated good luck with everything it isn't so bad and you'll be happy when you're teeth come out nice  Dental brace Breastfeeding Dentistry Tooth Dental caries Equine conformation Fecal incontinence Atomic Kitten Nine Inch Nails Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Social rule Drill bit Pitaten Mattress Massage Knife First aid Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cocaine Textile manufacturing Shaggy dog story Trapping Time Out of Mind Mouth ulcer Microeconomics Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Blood on the Tracks Traumatic incident reduction Kim Possible Coeliac disease Hand grenade Barbed wire Poker jargon Bon Jovi Sampling (music) Chronic fatigue syndrome Professional wrestling holds Diving Chair Dentures Rich Mullins AFI 100 Years series Weight training Tooth enamel Futurama (TV series - season 5) Humphrey Bogart Chewing gum Prostate cancer Oral sex Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Oral hygiene The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Crown (dentistry) Piccolo Junior Saga Urinary incontinence Radio controlled airplane Hormone replacement therapy (trans) The Shining (film) Wire Late Night with Conan O'Brien Ramones Tobacco smoking Kodocha Bullet Body piercing Philosophical skepticism Sail-plan Gingivitis The Dentist Sailing Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Adventures of Pete & Pete Tetrapod Halitosis Avenue Q Karen Horney Strap-on dildo Brewery The Amber Spyglass Corset 2000 Australian Grand Prix Rose (Doctor Who) Sawfiler Plastic God Emperor of Dune Singlish Goodness and value theory

dental hygienist i need info about it like i'm thinking of a major that i can do for college and i heard this one being good in money and it wont take that long in brief i will really thank you if you can give me more info about this carrer and if i could also become a dentist after i become a dental hygienist thanks dental hygienee is a great career if it is something that you really like and are interested in the thing about dental hygien programs that do not include a regular bachelors degree is that they really are only good for dental hygiene as far as time goes as long as you can get into a program it takes at least years however it is hard to get into many programs so there is often a waiting list after you get in and graduate you still have to pass the boars after another thing that you need to think about is that because it is a licensed profession you can only work in the state that you have a license if you want to move to somewhere else you will have to take that states tests the states all have different laws and things that the hygienist can do and you will have to be educated about those things also while it is only a yr program you will have to keep up with new information with continuing education programs many employers will pay for these classes but not all of them will if you do not keep up with these and get enough credits each year you can loose your license over all its a great profession but not something you should choose because its quick in school and makes good money its a lot of work and you have to love people and working with them and care about their health or it wont be worth what you can make best of luck in whatever you choose  Dentistry Oral hygiene Baylor College of Dentistry Physician Nurse Lawyer Juris Doctor Graduate school Doctorate Dental hygienist Education in the United States Education in Australia Architect Education in Germany Tooth Medical University of South Carolina Temple University Columbia University Chinese University of Hong Kong Tooth enamel University of Indonesia Education in Canada Publicly funded medicine Paralegal Medicare (Canada) General practitioner Kwantlen University College No Child Left Behind Act Social work Software engineering National Health Service Education in the People's Republic of China Education Medical school Dental caries Insurance University of Michigan Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences University of New England, Maine Seton Hall University University of Connecticut Law school Student loan University of Maryland, Baltimore Pitaten Health profession Education in Sweden The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio Teacher Public policy Methamphetamine Social rule Medical prescription Bachelor of Arts Community college Grade (education) Master of Laws Gwinnett University Center Stony Brook University Public bodies and task forces of the UK government Credit card Tufts University Georgetown University Health care in the United States Northeastern University, Boston Driver's license University of Central Florida Education in Finland College admissions Education in Hong Kong Education in the Republic of Ireland City and Guilds of London Institute Harvard University Bologna process Monopoly (game) University of Phoenix Canadian and American health care systems compared Affirmative action GNU General Public License Academic degree Chiropractic Dental brace Health care in Canada Emerson College Copyright law of the United Kingdom Athabasca University Athletic trainer Canada Health Act Education in Japan Child support Health insurance Social Security (United States) Florida State University Education in Romania Crown (dentistry) Air Education and Training Command GED

molar problem i have a horrible dental problem that i need advice on about seven years ago i know i was on vacation with my family i was chewing some gum and a good chunk of my right upper molar fell out into the gum i was chewing i guess i had a cavity and the tooth was so weak the piece just broke off anyway i haven't gotten it fixed yet i didn't really have the money for oral surgery the tooth has become grayish in color and the hole is still there with the gum exposed i can't chew on that side because whenever i do the exposed gum swells up and sometimes bleeds it feels like it might be filled with some sort of fluid i saw a dentist a year or so ago and he said i'd definitely need a root canal i should be getting this problem fixed soon but my question is what can i expect what is the basic procedure and will they put a crown or something in so that i can use that side of my mouth again any advice would be greatly appreciated also it hurts when anything touches the gum that's exposed it's incredibly sensitive the nerve in the tooth is dead causing the tooth to appear blackened the root canal procedure is basically simple and when it is done by an endodontists is virtually painless you will probably be prescribed an antibiotic first and teeth cleaning along with xrays root canals are done in visits they will clean out the old decay and dead nerve and place a temporary filling to make sure it is not bothering you later on meanwhile you will be checked for a accurate tooth color on your molar cap your next visit will be to grind down the molar enough to glue cap on and as usual will have to bite down on a special carbon paper to see if there is a part of the molar needing to be filed down to fit the grooves of your bite if this is not done properly you can have pain and have to go back for the cap to be properly fitted  Dentistry Tooth enamel Root canal Dental brace First aid Gingivitis Wisdom teeth Maxilla Halitosis Dentures Chronic fatigue syndrome Fecal incontinence Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Pneumonia Dialysis Bruxism Cocaine Oral hygiene Mouth ulcer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Traumatic brain injury Fancy rat Poker jargon Explosive material Domestic rabbit Fluoride therapy Prostate cancer Traumatic incident reduction Oral cancer Hamster Breastfeeding Electrophysiology Knife Hand grenade Wood Radiation therapy Condom Mojave people Bong Oral sex Internal ballistics Dental fillings CPU cache Medical prescription Dental implant Certified Nursing Assistant Cat Evidence of evolution Equine conformation Violin Dental floss Local anesthesia Surgery Medicine Hip fracture Chess terminology Babe Ruth Gramophone record Ferret The Dentist Kryptonite Erogenous zone Sawfiler Vernon Schillinger Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.

what has your experience been with having wisdom teeth removed if you have gotten your wisdom teeth removed i would like to know what your experience was do they give you anesthesia how is it administered if by needle did it hurt was the actual procedure painful during after i'm having mine removed soon and i'm just a little nervous i would like to know what to expect thanks in advance the anesthesia most dentists use is local which means they inject into the gum jawline it is uncomfortable but necessary for the extraction the only thing i found i didn't like during the procedure itself was the pressure of pulling pushing on the tooth itself but no it didn't hurt it was just weird you can request to be given gas but it is not easy to persuade most dentists to use this you hear the breaking of the tooth smell the burnt bone smell when they are trying to drill off portions to make the extraction easier but that is a given my dentist took two out from one side then the other two out on the other side days later not all four at once after the first two were out i had major swelling couldn't eat drink rinse anything i went back to my dentist and apparently while my cheek was still under the anesthesia i chewed on the inside of my cheek causing a sore and infection which caused the swelling the pain came several days later because the trauma was so bad the shock of it was delayed just place some warm salt water in the area don't try to swish just let it lie there for as long as you can stand it for up to a minute if possible then just open your mouth and let it drain out do not spit this will create a suction and draw more blood and could create a dry socket which is why the warning not to smoke after dental procedures this is what i did for the infection just in case for you laying on an ice pack or iced towel on affected side for mins on mins off take two hand towels soak and put them in plastic bags put in freezer after frozen take towel in bag out wrap in dry towel lie down on it or gently place it on jaw after minutes remove place towel bag back in freezer minutes later get other towel bag and repeat the process repeat this for about an hour after an hour wait another hour then try again while you are using one towel bag the other is refreezing so you won't be without one  Tooth Wisdom teeth Dental caries Menstrual cup Bong First aid Cocaine Breastfeeding Halitosis Mouth ulcer Local anesthesia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Abortion Dentistry Tooth enamel Bleeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Anesthesia Drowning Methamphetamine Body piercing Dentures Carpal tunnel syndrome Wound Manicure Fire fighting Dairy Tattoo Naruto jutsu Urinary incontinence Prostate cancer Textile manufacturing Intravenous therapy Dental brace Paget's disease of bone Massage Shaggy dog story Tobacco Epidural Milton H.

not satisfied with porcelain crown what should i do now i recently a few months ago had a root canal and a porcelain crown porcelain fused to metal done at the dental cosmetic center of houston to the first 'molar' tooth behind my left canine upon arrival at home i looked in the mirror and was a little taken aback by it i could clearly easily distinguish it from the rest of my teeth for it had a very prominent dark grey line at my gum line i asked about this at another visit and the dentist sort of suppressed the inquiry and said that it was my natural tooth structure and that he could not see a line bs so after a normal brushing this is about two months later i noticed a dark spot on the inner side of it in the shape of a circle i tried brushing the hell out of it and flossing it it would not come off my mom believes it is the porcelain that has worn off these crowns are supposed to last a long time i want an all porcelain crown they never told me it would be a pfm what should i do now well the line that you are seeing by the gum line is the metal showing this part should be tucked up underneath the gums so it is not visible however old age or receding gum lines can cause it to show way in the future depending on your age also it sounds like they did not pick the correct shade there are a lot of shades to pick from they should have matched you up with a shade guide then let you look at the color they chose to see if you like it as well one thing they are correct about is that you dont want an all porcelain crown for a molar tooth they are good for anterior front teeth but not molars the reason why is because that is where all your biting force is and it will easily break he probably knows he messed up and does not want to admit it because then he will have to pay the lab about dollars to replace it he should of had to check it out though before he cemented it you have to choices either go back and demand he replaces it because you are very unhappy with it or live with it  Tooth Dental caries Crown (dentistry) Tooth enamel Maxilla Dentistry Hangul Mandible Bruxism Oral hygiene The Dentist Gray Wolf Dentures 2000 Australian Grand Prix Drill bit Wallpaper group Nine Inch Nails Cosmetic dentistry Evolution of the Horse Halitosis Dental floss Microeconomics Snooker Chewing gum Evidence of evolution Fast bowling Pottery Sundial Equine conformation CPU cache German Shepherd Dog Plastic Heraldry Mojave people Money Social rule Macropod Textile manufacturing Dog training Color Cocaine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sperm Whale Sphenoid bone Combine (Half-Life 2) Sawfiler The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Dental implant Occipital bone Bulk vending StarCraft Episode VI Explosive material EastEnders Umlaut Root canal Bass guitar Spanish verbs Opportunity rover Progressive rock Economics Dentition Gold Oral sex Tire Knife Fluoride therapy Characters in the Smurfs Toothbrush The Ashlee Simpson Show The Joker's Wild Los Angeles Kings Vernon Schillinger Slot machine Shawn Michaels StarCraft: Uprising The Amazing Race Temporal bone Piccolo Junior Saga The Contender (television series) Hollywood Squares Sydney Riot of 1879 Knots Landing Color blindness Dark Phoenix Saga Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Charles Goodyear Quarashi Netsuke The Invisibles Paul Is Dead

does everyone have to get their wisdom teeth out i don't want to because it seems kinda scary does it hurt really bad mine have been in for almost years and they never mentioined pulling them out how old r u usually when u have to get them pulled out when i was in my early twenties i had both my wisdom teeth taken out at the bottom of my mouth i was terrified to be honest but i was sedated and frankly i went straight to sleep and had to be woken up they give another sedative to knock you out until way after the operation is over with they also numb your gums before extracting so pain is not felt at all during the procedure or indeed for a while afterwards you will be given painkillers and antibiotics too for maybe a week afterwards basically don't worry mine was a very comfortable and positive experience and my gums had to be cut to remove the teeth because they were severely tilting onto my other teeth please don't worry you will need someone to take you home afterwards though and probably will just sleep for a while afterwards too but on the other hand if you need your wisdom teeth extraction is a simple manner of just local numbing and extraction then that hurts a lot less and heals a lot quicker also straight growing wisdom teeth are apparently quite easy to remove if needed to be that's what my dentist said last time i saw him need the tops one done soon most importantly though the age of extraction varies wildly from person to person and frankly if they will only be removed if they are causing a problem and in some people they never have to be removed just because they are there does not automatically mean they are a problem or indeed that they need removing let your dentists advise you on this but if its not been mentioned then you probably don't need to worry about this as yet good luck  Tooth Dentistry Wisdom teeth Breastfeeding Manual transmission Carpal tunnel syndrome Diving Chronic fatigue syndrome Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bruxism Dental caries Theory of conduct Dental brace Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Domestic rabbit Social rule Mouth ulcer Oral sex Halitosis Dentures Oral hygiene Dialysis Bondage (BDSM) Drill bit Final Fantasy magic Equine conformation Adjustable gastric band Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Naval mine Cocaine Female genital cutting Certified Nursing Assistant Knife Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Diazepam Strap-on dildo Traumatic brain injury Chlorpromazine Sleep Grief Blood (computer game) Endocarditis Methamphetamine Milton H.

what is a safe and easy way to whiten teeth i love coffee and my teeth are not discolored yet but i'd like them a shade brighter how about those listerine stripes are those safe cynthia if you look at the list of ingredients in most tooth whitening products including the strips you may notice that the tooth whitening ingredient is some form of hydrogen peroxide just use hydrogen peroxide instead of your regular mouth wash every morning and before bed after brushing and flossing use hydrogen peroxide as your mouth wash you can buy hydrogen peroxide in the brown bottle at your local drugstore for about for a ounce bottle mix ounce hydrogen peroxide with ounce hot water and swirl in your mouth for about minute spit out do not swallow and then rinse your mouth out several times with cool water a ounce bottle will last about weeks hydrogen peroxide will not only whiten your teeth it also kills the bacteria in the mouth that causes bad breath and cavities for even more tooth whitening try a hydrogen peroxide and baking soda toothpaste  Hydrogen peroxide Halitosis Toothpaste Listerine Tooth enamel Tooth Mouth ulcer Vinegar Organic peroxide Body piercing Dental caries Fluoride therapy Alcoholic beverage Oral hygiene Cocaine Benzoyl peroxide Oral sex Acetone peroxide Flour Tattoo Laundry detergent Dental floss Leather Breastfeeding Hydrogen Soft drink Gingivitis Water Hair coloring Sento Sterilization (microbiology) Fugu First aid Hydrogen chloride Chewing gum Sodium percarbonate Agar plate Plastic Illegal drug trade Bread Bleach Hydrogen sulfide Sulfuric acid Glossitis Coca-Cola Acetic acid Tooth bleaching Water purification Explosive material Rebreather Acne Cosmetic dentistry Jala neti Skunk Breathing gas Toothbrush Casting Bong Energy development Hard water Pebble bed reactor Certified Nursing Assistant Contact lens Brewery Catalase Hydrochloric acid Drink Happy Tree Friends Hyperthermia Hydrogen economy Menstrual cup Genericized trademark Submarine Hamburger Car washing techniques Cyanide Rocket Methamphetamine Cooking Gastroesophageal reflux disease Wisdom teeth Foodborne illness Crocodilia Internal combustion engine Tea Sperm Whale Ice cream Ethanol Ozone Hamster Soy protein Solvent Water (molecule) Haloalkane Autonomous building

i chipped my tooth about years ago had it capped everything was fine after brushing my teeth with baking soda a few days ago not a normal practice for me my tooth has been hurting where the chip is i get the sensation that its chipped again it sucks to eat right now and i did notice that there is a faint little brown spot on a corner where the tooth and cap meet am i going to die just kidding but is my tooth rotting or what the hell is going on hi i've been in dentistry for over years and unless the dentist ground your tooth down and took lots of impressions with a tray of material in your mouth for several minutes at a time you do not have a cap or crown same thing the covers the whole tooth to the gum line i'm guessing that you had a chair side plastic acrylic crown and these only a few years if he did a filling that is something completely different crowns caps don't break off if they do you would see the metal underneath i would call the dentist and make an appt if the material came off i bet you have decay under it and that is why it fell off the very best thing is get an experts hands on and get fixed now before you need a root canal the exposed dentin will hurt because it has no protective layer of enamel marie  Tooth enamel Dentistry Poker jargon Knife Bruxism Crown (dentistry) Dental brace Dentin Fluoride therapy Betting (poker) Plastic Bong Root canal Paint Nine Inch Nails The Dentist The Legend of Zelda series enemies Oral sex Laser engraving Drill bit Mattress Happy Tree Friends Dental fillings Ivory Shark Glacier Cocaine Tooth development Mouth ulcer Casting First aid Desert Amalgam Cookware and bakeware Floppy disk Halitosis Kim Possible Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Corrosion Tooth bleaching Tetrapod Orthodontics Seismic retrofit Toothbrush The Fairly OddParents Evidence of evolution Dentures Raisin Craps Vermicompost Hand grenade Netsuke Oral hygiene Wisdom teeth Cosmetic dentistry EastEnders The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap Bulk vending Cigar Pastel Eric Cartman Breastfeeding Gingivitis Chopsticks Stairway Snooker Collecting fossils Clothing Leaf The Shining (film) Buster (comic) Glass Bread Woodworking Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Carnivorous plant Columbine High School massacre Sawfiler Tyrannosaurus rex Gold American Pie (song) Pantera Chewing gum Honey fungus Manicure Screw Nile crocodile Textile manufacturing The Amazing Race Tuff Wood Wood carving USS Yorktown (CV-5) Potato

mild periodontitis how would a dentist treat mild periodontitis i am pretty sure i have it i am going to the dentist on thursday and just wondered if its going to hurt at all and what happens thanks well if its mild they most likely won't have to do any serious surgical work which they'd refer you to a periodontist for that would involve pulling cutting your gums nasty stuff they'll probably reccommend quadrant cleaning which is very intensive cleanings done by a hygenist which focus on one forth of you mouth at each appointment to get the calculus and bacteria out you'd have to get that done every six months until your perio charting came back normal perio charting is where they probe the space between your gum and teeth to see how far the connective tissue has receeded if they start probing and you hear numbers s and ares normal but once you get s s and i hope you dont have any s then its more serious  Gingivitis Dental caries Dentistry Tooth Oral hygiene Tooth enamel Halitosis Periodontal ligament Acne Traumatic brain injury Dentures Mouth ulcer The Dentist Dental brace Endocarditis Social rule Oral cancer Chewing gum Methamphetamine Urinary incontinence Wound Vitamin D Stuttering Chronic fatigue syndrome Surgery Aortic dissection Wisdom teeth Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pneumonia Hollaback Girl First aid Carpal tunnel syndrome Medicine Crohn's disease Atomic Kitten Normal distribution Orthodontics Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Vowel Acoustic neuroma Advertising Earwax Androgen insensitivity syndrome Borg Toothbrush Intersex surgery Sleep apnea Sawfiler Tobacco Domestic rabbit Endometriosis Dental implant Psoriasis Staining (biology) Cheese Milton H.

how can i cure bleeding gums ok i did not have the best oral hygene when i was younger and it seems as though my gums have always been inflamed and irritated but i do brush and floss regularly now but my gums still bleed very easily what can i do without having to visit the dentist a very traditional and reliable method of helping gums become firmer is to rinse gargle with salt water mix several tablespoons of table salt into a glass of tap water and swish the salt water solution in the closed mouth for one and one half minutes three times a day it will take two weeks to see the results however the results are far more effective than conventional over the counter remedies which in my opinion are overpriced also do not buy a firm toothbrush but instead use one with very soft bristles  Halitosis Tooth Toothbrush Gingivitis Dental caries Oral hygiene Dentistry Psoriasis Dental floss Plastic Methamphetamine Bulk vending Diarrhea Bread Tofu Dietary fiber Vinegar Homeopathy Hydrogen peroxide Collodion process Rehydration Acne Dishwasher Charles Goodyear Stomach cancer Oral sex Kosher foods Hiccup Listerine Cyanide First aid Oral cancer Sodium chloride Ammonia Brush Warfarin Gum arabic Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Medical prescription Electrolyte Dental brace Traumatic brain injury Cheese Common cold Yarrow Electrophysiology Mattress Eczema Toothpaste Nasal congestion Hangul Salt Acetic acid The Dentist Bleeding Gums Murphy Fluoride therapy Anthrax Casting Bong Hamster Shaving Sterling silver Body piercing Haggis Marine aquarium Sauerkraut Sea-Monkey Menstrual cycle Bladderwort Sodium Topps Chewing gum Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Flax Breastfeeding Hydrochloric acid Cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Edible salt Vernon Schillinger Urticaria Sodium hypochlorite Koala Magnesium Cocaine Oral contraceptive Decompression sickness Leukemia Water Hard water Glossitis Ham Sewage treatment Dentures Lodge Committee Electric motor

my year old son had a root canal yesterday the dentist said part of the drill broke off in his root she also said the tooth was still infected then she went ahead and sealed it up and said she was done he's still in a lot of pain she says all this is normal any ideas i've never had a root canal but i thought the pain was supposed to go away once you were done and i thought you couldn't do it while there was still infection present thanks he doesn't have any insurance so we're paying cash for this the dentist did pack it with antibiotics and told him to come back when he came back yesterday it was still infected and they finished it anyway he was on a day course of antibiotics before they ever touched him too i just had my first root canal done back in march um i hope you didn't pay this woman because it is never okay to leave any sort of surgical or dental tool in a patient's body when she drilled into the canal she should have packed it with medicine before sealing it up they do this in steps so if this was some so called one step or one time root canal that is wrong they go in and drill a bit get the infection out pack it with medicine and they seal it up for two weeks then you go back they take all that stuff out and redo it i went back a third time they took the medicine out put whatever it is they put in there which should not hurt by the last time because the root and nerve ending are gone then they seal it with the crown some pain after is a little bit normal because they are drilling around but he shouldn't be in excrutiating pain when all is said and done you need to get him to another dentist asap then you need to contact your insurance company to stop payments because this woman in my opinion did not do her job and if the next dentist you take him to says that what she did was incorrect you need to report her to the ada and get in writing all of the things that have gone wrong  Dentistry Root canal Chronic fatigue syndrome EastEnders Dental caries First aid Surgery Hey Jude Endocarditis Drill bit Tooth enamel Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cellulitis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Traumatic brain injury Intraocular lens Traditional Chinese medicine Carpal tunnel syndrome Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Theory of conduct Babe Ruth Blood on the Tracks Milton H.

do crest whitestrips work i got the classic kind that you use for days dont tell me to use another brand because i spent like on these im not going back to the store i just want to know your results thanks please dont tell me to try other things im getting senior pictures taken in weeks i dont have time or the desire to try anything else thanks overall i would say that most of my patient's have had some measure of success with the crest whitestrips some more than others the results are usually pretty quick noticeable in the first few days best in a week or longer it is best if you can do yourself the favor of using them right after you get your teeth cleaned as any staining and buildup tartar or plaque will impede their ability to work also don't use fluoride toothpaste before putting the strips on same reason all of the methods strips trays custom trays in office whitening have the potential to make your teeth temporarily sensitive but will not harm the enamel if you get sensitive use the product every other day in conjunction with a sensitive tooth toothpaste you might try to drink dark liquids through a straw and don't smoke most whitening toothpastes just remove stain on the surfaces of your teeth and therefore are not so effective whatever method you use it will not whiten your teeth for life as you age your teeth will get darker and may need to be whitened again good luck jamrdh a dental hygienist  Tooth enamel Fluoride therapy Dental caries Oral hygiene Halitosis Cocaine Tooth bleaching Hydrogen peroxide Dental brace Explosive material Chewing gum Methamphetamine Oral sex Plastic Psoriasis Bong Transformer Insulin Cosmetic dentistry Scarification The Apprentice 2 Breastfeeding Mouth ulcer Dental floss Listerine Textile manufacturing Tobacco Ultraviolet Dairy Raisin Mattress Allergy Japanese tea ceremony Motor oil Sento Insurance Microeconomics Potassium nitrate Dentures Gingivitis Hygiene Acupuncture Chronic fatigue syndrome Shampoo Hamster Social rule Alcoholic beverage Coeliac disease Fasting Sewage treatment Arsenal F.C.

pockets between teeth and no periodontal disease i'm years old last month or so i got a check up no periodontal disease i brush daily floss here and there at least every other day wearing braces anyways i have holes between my teeth some of which are really deep and some are just coming about dentist tells me im brushing too hard i dont i brush very light i cant get lighter than that then they say its cuz of the braces again bull my friends have had em too and nothing happened to them and i asked them and turns out they dont floss at all and nothings wrong with them i mean wtf is going on here im pretty pissed any suggestions comments information would be greatly appreciated i am thinking that these spaces might be due to your teeth being moved sometimes just a little bit of space between the teeth can be a major food trap and very annoying also the dentist may think you are brushing to hard because sometimes the gums appear traumatized due to the fact that you brush above the brackets and also below the brackets closer to the gums than you normally would which can cause wearing of the gum tissue it sounds like you are on target with your home care i would wait and see if things improve as you teeth move jamrdh a dental hygienist  Dentistry Dental brace Tooth Dental caries Oral hygiene Tooth enamel Halitosis Dental floss Dentures Toothbrush Orthodontics Milton H.

can this be done by a dentist wisedom tooth extr before any of you click the reply button for this question please keep in mind that this question is primary directed towards licensed dentists only so if you are not a dentist i appreciate the time you took to read my question but i can't really accept advice from you so no hard feelings now for the dentists i have a wisedom tooth which is impacted horizontally i went to see a dentist but she referred me to a maxillofacial surgen the nearest appointment for the maxillofacial surgen is in the mid of september more than a month away i am afraid that by that time my wisedom tooth will crack the nd molar tooth i'll live the next month in agony and pain and i will lose molar teeth instead of one here is how my wisedom tooth looks like and its position http www animated teeth com wisdom teeth impacted wisdom tooth an gif can this be removed by a private dentist or does this procedure require a maxillofacial surgen not only a dentist needs to give you advice on this because lots of people have gone through the same thing and probably have asked the same questions as you like me both of my bottom wisdom teeth were impacted horizontally my family dentist is the one that discovered them through x rays but referred me to an oral surgeon too he said that it was something that he didn't do in his office because oral surgeons actually specialize in stuff like that and the surgery was a little more complicated than a normal extraction your dentist is doing this for your own good don't worry mine were discovered in june i didn't get an appointment with the surgeon until september and then i ended up having the surgery in november nothing happened to my other teeth during all those months so you have nothing to worry about the most that they said would happen is that the wisdom teeth would just push my other teeth out of alignment but they moved right back into place after the surgery i ended up having all out at once my top ones were fine my oral surgeon insisted on doing my surgery under general anaesthetic at a hospital because of the horizontal teeth so if they suggest that it's not such a bad idea trust me they give you a local one too so you can't feel your jaw area plus they knock you out so you can't feel a thing during the whole surgery  Dentistry Tooth Oral and maxillofacial surgery Dental brace Surgery Dental caries Orthodontics Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Stomach cancer Medicine Transsexuality Grover Cleveland National Health Service Milton H.

what are the odds of me having gum disease hi a part of my gum seems a little darker but i do not feel any pain and there are no other strange symptoms what are the odds of me having gum disease and is treatment painful i have a dentist appointment but i am just very paranoid i had the beginning signs of gingivitus during my braces years since the doctor caught it early i was able to treat it with listerine mouth wash twice a day until it finally dissapeared while brushing my gums gently daily since your gums don't bleed when you brush your teeth and its not painful to eat chances are if you do have gum disease it's not severe but see your dentist soon if you do have early gum disease you maybe able to treat it with out any severe treatment perhaps listerine maybe d my grandma and dad had gum disease in order for them to clean out the bacteria they had to cut into the gums and clean out the infection of course it doesnt hurt during the process because your numbed with lots of novacane after surgery there will be some throbbing where you had the oral surgery but pain medication can fix that plus gums heal rather quickly nothing to fear  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dentistry Mouth ulcer Tooth Halitosis Fecal incontinence Gingivitis Dental caries Surgery Oral sex Wisdom teeth Carpal tunnel syndrome Crohn's disease Paget's disease of bone Stroke First aid Traumatic brain injury Prostate cancer Cancer Hip fracture Medicine Cirrhosis Anthrax Dental floss Cocaine Syphilis Diabetic retinopathy Ulcerative colitis Wound Dental brace Acne Osteoarthritis Oral hygiene Migraine Ebola Chronic fatigue syndrome Smallpox Hormone replacement therapy (trans) The Dentist Leukemia Rocky Mountain spotted fever Diarrhea Methamphetamine Traditional Chinese medicine Endometriosis Clomipramine Gonorrhoea Body piercing Escherichia coli O157:H7 Lung cancer Breastfeeding Multiple sclerosis Coeliac disease Hemorrhoid Lupus erythematosus Coronary heart disease Foodborne illness Rabies Group A streptococcal infection Pain Medical analysis of circumcision Ehrlichiosis Listerine Myocardial infarction Ferret Certified Nursing Assistant Malaria Diabetes mellitus Peptic ulcer Obsessive-compulsive disorder Herpes simplex virus Breast cancer Ovarian cancer Adolf Hitler's medical health Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Sickle-cell disease Esophageal cancer Gastroesophageal reflux disease Tooth enamel AIDS Colorectal cancer Common cold Cephalexin Anorexia nervosa Asthma History of medicine Temporomandibular joint disorder Miscarriage Conjunctivitis Gastroparesis Psychosurgery

scared of the dentist i went to the dentist about weeks ago due to a toothache he told me that i needed to have root canal done and gave me some antibiotics which i took they didnt take away the pain so i went back he gave me another lot of antibiotics and i have just finished taking them and the pain still hasnt gone its more weeks till i can have the root canal theres no way i can go to another dentist as im registered with him and have to have a years worth of treatment before i can change there is a way to get rid of the pain completely by having the tooth pulled but im too scared to have a needle please dont say your not alone as i already know that and it doesnt help solve this they wont let me have gas either and im only and dont want to have a gap in my mouth from where the tooth was what should i do the biggest accomplishment i have is getting over my fear of the dentist i feared the dentist like the plague and never went for years a saying from my mum is your teeth are your best investment and i believe that to be true your teeth generally are the first thing people notice even more so if you have terrible teeth and something you'll need for the rest of your life now is your chance to look at keeping them and looking after them honestly what's the worse that can happen you feel a little prick in your mouth and the you go numb you get paper cuts that sting much worse i manage a small team and two team members were also as scared to go as i used to be my suggestion take the day off work to have it done and enjoy your time off you'll feel much better for having it done and really think why you worried so much about such a small inconvenience you can do it hope this helped  Tooth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mouth ulcer Dental caries Textile manufacturing RuneScape quests 2000 Australian Grand Prix Babe Ruth Glen Jacobs Milton H.

gum disease and an abscess tooth that is loose help don't know what to do but i'm sure that i have gum disease stemming from years back all of my research indicates that i got it while pregnant with my first daughter i cracked a molar too during that pregnancy so now that all of that has happened i never went to the dentist because i was either pregnant or didn't have insurance now the tooth is loose and i can't chew down on it it formed some sort of what i think is an abscess on my gums i can see the signs of my gum wearing away to expose my teeth too suggesting the worst stage of gum disease i didn't know all of this until i started researching is there a dentist on here that can inform me of what i have to look forward too i'm terrified of the dentist it's part of the reason i never went your research almost certainly has told you what you have to look forward to if you don't get treatment and it ain't good there are dentists that specialize in sedation dentistry that's one way of dealing with your fears you go to sleep in the dentist's office and wake up with the repairs and cleaning done hypnotism is another potential solution doing nothing will definitely make things worse you also need to start practicing good gum hygiene including waterpicking below the gumline with a fine rubber tip nozzle  Tooth Dentistry Dental caries Chewing gum Tooth enamel Oral hygiene Gingivitis Dental brace The Dentist Wisdom teeth Cocaine Surgery Orthodontics Mojave people Hypnosis Dental fillings Stem cell Vernon Schillinger My Family (television) Root canal Crown (dentistry) Tobacco smoking Medicine Fecal incontinence Insomnia Nicotine Dentures Milton H.

does invisalign work i've seen the commercials about invisalign and i'm getting braces soon but i'm wondering if invisalign really works and makes your teeth straighter yes but it's a long process invisalign is a system of retainers that eventually straighten out your teeth you go through several retainers before you see results after i had braces i had retainers similar to those of invisalign and they were obnoxious and you can't eat with them in braces are easier  Dental brace Orthodontics Drill bit Dentistry Scoliosis Tooth Tooth enamel Bracket C programming language Barbed wire PostScript Woodworking Linux Osteoclast High-speed rail Canoe Saxophone Dental caries C.F.

how old were you when you got your wisdom teeth removed i just got mine taken out and i'm only that's one of the younger ages i've heard my parents got theirs taken out in their mid twenties i think it would be pretty early to get them removed even late in high school i don't know how unusual is this if you got your wisdom teeth removed how old were you by the way the pain is really intense which i didn't really expect i was when i had all wisdom teeth surgically removed painful for a while don't be afraid to zone out for a little while on pain medication a few days is all you need but in a week or so you should feel almost like new just beware of infections i washed my gums with that little syringe a billion times and still got an infection in one of the cut areas and it had to be lanced open so i had a little longer healing time they usually take x rays to determine if you wisdom teeth are coming in right or will disturb your other teeth i can not imagine they would remove earlier than necessary at least i hope not sorry about the pain hope it goes away soon  Wisdom teeth Tooth Milton H.

dental bridge i have having one put in tomorrow however i read that the st appt they prepare the teeth and then take a cast of the teeth but my dentist took the cast before any prep on the teeth supportin the false tooth is this still ok or will there be a problem now also why do they have to grind your good teeth down cant they just fit something over them that wont eventually cause damage to the teeth well he showed me what the bridge would look like and it was caps on each side of a tooth made in the lab i am assuming he is puttin the other teeth over my exsiting teeth since i only have one tooth missing the cost is not my concerne the insurance is picking up the tab on this one he made sure before even suggestin to have it put in i just kinda feel like its a waste of time cuase its in the back and it doesnt really affect my confidence or anything since no one sees it anyways i just cant find much reserch out there about them and ppl told me they hurt for days after first off there are several kinds of possible bridges you're having put in the treatment of each depends on what kind you're having i have a marilyn bridge which was inserted almost years ago which is a miracle they usually fall out after or less the imprint of my teeth was made prior to my bridge being implanted they did this so the prostetics company the people who made my porcelin teeth knew what size and shape to make my teeth then when my prostetic was inserted the dentist drilled two 'grooves' down the side of each supporting tooth and slid the bridge into the tracks grooves he made some adhesive was used to ensure the bridge was secure in the grooves i have had not one problem with my marilyn bridge the space in between my 'real' teeth is too small for an implant so this is the only option for me both my 'fake' teeth and my 'real' teeth are fine my 'real' teeth have a layer of adhesive holding the prostetic into the grooves so there is no risk of cavity there or no risk more than anywhere else fitting something over your real teeth would be a porcelin veneer type cosmetic dentistry which costs much more and has the same risks as a marilyn bridge they both can be stained they both can come loose they both can affect the neighboring teeth if you're having a bridge installed make sure that your dentist has done this many times or is working with a dentist that is make sure you're prostetic company is experience and has a warranty on their prostetic the last thing you need is a manufacturer problem causing your bridge to break insurance may not cover that you'll do fine make sure you floss under and around the bridge and you'll do fine congrats on yoru new teeth  Dentistry Tooth enamel Dental brace Tooth Drill bit Dental caries Crown (dentistry) Dentures Plastic Prostate cancer Cosmetic dentistry Insurance Methamphetamine Oral hygiene Floppy disk Seismic retrofit Screw Gramophone record Urinary incontinence The Dentist Menstrual cup Domestic rabbit Key (lock) Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Dental fillings Mattress Internal ballistics Bruxism Dental floss Casting Stem cell Equine conformation Mandible Knife Nine Inch Nails Pneumonia Tire Orthodontics Bullet Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Printed circuit board Scientology beliefs and practices Humphrey Bogart Life insurance Woodworking Medicine Bluetooth Health insurance Acupuncture Marilyn Monroe Halitosis Citigroup Procrastination Fluoride therapy Electrical wiring Table saw Hand grenade Nuclear power Epistemology Mercury (element) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Asbestos Ethernet Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Solar cell Radiation therapy Capital accumulation Extreme Programming Trapping Glacier De Lorean DMC-12 Cephalic disorder The Fairly OddParents Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Publicly funded medicine Portsmouth Block Mills USB flash drive Laserdisc USS Yorktown (CV-5) Computer virus Tank Gingivitis Breast implant Humerus Option Car handling Coeliac disease Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Stroke Risk management Wire Condom Enigma machine Traumatic brain injury

what impact do food and drinks have on dental health also what food and drink is best for dental health and worst almost all foods contain some form of sugar which causes tooth decay all food though if left in the mouth will support the growth of germs and other mouth diseases like gingivitis and gum disease plaque build up will result which pushes the gums away from the teeth giving germs even more space to hide left alone these can lead to bone disease and bone loss same applies to most drinks except water milk is good regular dentist visits will help brushing three times a day and before bed is a must for good hygiene  Dental caries Dentistry Oral hygiene Gingivitis Dental brace Mouth ulcer Dentures Fluoride therapy Halitosis Milk Certified Nursing Assistant Sugar substitute Hygiene Chewing gum The Dentist Coeliac disease Raisin Foodborne illness Dental floss Orthodontics Oral sex Wisdom teeth Coca-Cola Crown (dentistry) Diarrhea Listerine Hamster Methamphetamine Paget's disease of bone Fluoride Nutrition History of medicine Xylitol Breastfeeding Toothbrush Livestock Dental implant Dental fillings Toothpaste Fecal incontinence Protein-energy malnutrition Tocopherol Kosher foods Crohn's disease Plastic Dietary fiber Dairy Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Bruxism Pepsi-Cola Vegetarianism Chocolate Stem cell Fancy rat Sugar Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Domestic rabbit Dental hygienist Oral cancer Ferret Veganism Phosphoric acid Bubblegum Sewage treatment Cheese Alcoholism Clomipramine Transmission (medicine) Soft drink Water Hypoglycemia Low-carbohydrate diet Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Osteoporosis Fasting United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East Stomach cancer Tetrapod Surgery 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Dieting Natural Hygiene Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Atkins Nutritional Approach Disinfection Rickets Cancer Germ theory of disease Animal Alcoholic beverage Raw food diet Drink Junk food Medicine Endocarditis Escherichia coli O157:H7

is it okay to use expired teeth whitener my orthodontist today gave me six month old rembrandt teeth whitener today to use in my clear retainers do you think it would be okay to use it your ortho gave it to you so that seems like a safe source most doctors and dentists get boxes of samples from the sales reps most are close to expiration it is as safe as the tube you would buy in the store it will not poison you but the active ingredients will just not be as strong be careful with bleaching your teach though maybe google around for some consumer reports these products have come into fashion over the last ten years some people have complained that it stripped the enamel off their teeth and your dentist won't care about that because it isn't physically harmful it just means that you will need veneers within the next years which is big money for him also note bleaching your teeth will cause tooth sensitivity and gray teeth i would toss it in the garbage can after worth of cosmetic dental work on my own teeth you just don't need it much better to brush with soft bristles and floss times a day  Tooth enamel Tooth Dentistry Dental caries Dental brace Orthodontics Toothpaste Cosmetic dentistry Hydrogen peroxide Tooth bleaching Oral hygiene Hamster Toothbrush Dental fillings Digital rights management Halitosis Dog Breastfeeding Flour Mercury (element) Listerine Animal testing Plastic Surveillance Coeliac disease Crown (dentistry) Brush Characters in the Smurfs Gingivitis Coca-Cola Urine Clomipramine Cocaine Domestic rabbit Chronic fatigue syndrome Pharmaceutical company Methamphetamine Poker jargon Bruxism Elephant The Dentist Little Shop of Horrors Halogen Tom DeLay Soft drink Wal-Mart Hitler's death Pyramid (game show) Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) African American Vernacular English Shark Urinary incontinence Clothing Guinea pig National Health Service Audiophile Medicine Internet fraud Fluoride Alcoholic beverage Drill bit Humphrey Bogart Contact lens Dave Grohl Cheese Arguments for and against drug prohibition Menstrual cup Psoriasis Textile manufacturing Physical attractiveness Trademark Timeline of alternative rock Glen Jacobs L'Or__al Growth hormone treatment Poison Hemp My Family (television) Leeds United F.C.

am i teething my wisdom teeth are growing now and it hurts itches all i want to do is bite on something to relieve the irritation i believe that this would be time to have an appointment with your dentist if your wisdom teeth are trying to erupt or coming through the gum i do not think it would be a good idea to bite on something that may cause you to have more of a problem some mouth washes have alcohol in them and cause burning pain your gum will probably become more painful with time be careful of the mouthwash you use a dentist will be your best option he may want you to take an antibotic for infection if it is present many people have problems with their wisdom teeth and have to have them eventually removed  Dental caries Dentistry Wisdom teeth Gingivitis Halitosis Oral hygiene Breastfeeding Tooth enamel Mouth ulcer Bruxism Psoriasis Crown (dentistry) Dental brace Fecal incontinence First aid Oral cancer Dentures Cirrhosis Certified Nursing Assistant Itch Methamphetamine Bubblegum The Dentist Endocarditis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Traumatic brain injury Body piercing Cocaine Hydrogen peroxide Chewing gum Tobacco smoking Toothpaste Root canal Dental floss Carpal tunnel syndrome Anesthesia Eczema Babe Ruth Coeliac disease Glossitis Chronic fatigue syndrome Listerine Al-Razi Callus Scabies Tarantula Urinary incontinence Earwax Pain Pneumonia Prostate cancer Yarrow Antiseptic Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stomach cancer Dandruff Surgery Diarrhea Gastroesophageal reflux disease Cancer Xerostomia Clomipramine Clove Otitis externa Esophageal cancer Mosquito Orthodontics Tongue piercing Goodness and value theory Ferret Aspartame Horse tack Alcoholics Anonymous Hamster Shaving Stoicism Medical analysis of circumcision Shark Polyols Domestic rabbit Chlorpromazine Lyme disease Hypoglycemia Cat James Robson Diving Toothbrush Oz (TV series) Common cold Guinea pig Jock itch Hell Capsaicin Nine Inch Nails Kim Possible Rosacea Crohn's disease

new dentist first visit was abnormall short should i change i have not been to the dentist in years i just got insurance and picked a dentist in my town the practice was beautiful and seemed to have many patient i went into the exam room and right away the dentist came in sat me back and started scraping my teeth pretty rapidly it didnt seem as thorough as in the past with other dentists after about seconds of scraping he cleaned my teeth with the scrubber machine thing and it was over the hygenist took my xrays and i was dismissed no one asked me if i floss or smoke or drink pop or asked how i brush my teeth or talked to me at all it was over with in less than minutes i am a little turned off maybe my teeth are in really good shape but they have been my whole life so i dont understand why this time my exam was so short did i get jipped it is always hard to judge another professionals actions but when i see a new patient it almost always takes me about an hour first you want to fully review someones medical history take xrays if necessary clean the teeth if you can achieve this in one visit based on patient need discuss all aspects of the patient's homecare routine diets habits and then go over homecare and answer any questions or patient concerns this is the most important time to get to know a new patient and find out what their concerns and wishes might be i feel it is always the best time to make a change in a patient's oral health care routine as well maybe your teeth are in great shape but if you were on time for your appointment not hour late which would then cause you to interfere with another patient's appointment time than it sounds like you got short changed i would probably get your xrays and find a new practice ask friends and co workers for a recommendation if the first visit didn't leave you with a positive feeling i am not sure the subsequent ones will either hope that helps jamrdh a dental hygienist  Dentistry Tooth Oral hygiene Prostate cancer Tooth enamel Dental caries Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dental brace The Dentist Medicine Milton H.

fast ways to whiten teeth overall i would say that most of my patient's have had some measure of success with the crest whitestrips some more than others the results are usually pretty quick noticeable in the first few days best in a week or longer our office uses crest supreme which are much stronger than what you can buy in a drugstore and don't cost that much more vs you can purchase the drugstore version but if you can do yourself the favor of using them right after you get your teeth cleaned as any staining and buildup tartar or plaque will impede their ability to work also don't use fluoride toothpaste before putting the strips on same reason the strips are probably your best low price alternative much less than in office whitening or custom trays about i am also hearing happy reviews with the aquafresh whitening trays unlike the strips they don't have the tendency to slip or move all of the methods strips trays custom trays in office whitening have the potential to make your teeth temporarily sensitive but will not harm the enamel if you get sensitive use the product every other day in conjunction with a sensitive tooth toothpaste you might try to drink dark liquids through a straw and don't smoke most whitening toothpastes just remove stain on the surfaces of your teeth and therefore are not so effective whatever method you use it will not whiten your teeth for life as you age your teeth will get darker and may need to be whitened again good luck jamrdh a dental hygienist  Tooth enamel Fluoride therapy Tooth Toothpaste Dental caries Fluoride Oral hygiene Dental brace Halitosis Plastic Tooth bleaching Cocaine Microeconomics Transformer The Apprentice 2 Explosive material Cosmetic dentistry Methamphetamine Dairy Mouth ulcer Oral sex Insurance Chewing gum Crown (dentistry) Inflation Diamond enhancement Psoriasis Bicycle lighting Allergy Supply and demand Drill bit Audio data compression Titanium Theory of conduct Breastfeeding Insulin Homeopathy Acupuncture Sewage treatment Equine conformation Food Dentures Deflation (economics) Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Water purification Mattress Domestic rabbit Corrosion Ultraviolet Chronic fatigue syndrome Overclocking Rum Raisin Magnetic resonance imaging Japanese tea ceremony Growth hormone treatment Tobacco Welding Electrophysiology Coca-Cola Listerine Coffee Alcoholic beverage RuneScape weapons Potassium nitrate Dental floss Medical analysis of circumcision Economics Gingivitis Hygiene Sento Textile manufacturing Poker jargon Daz Dillinger Fasting Surveillance Japan-United States relations Shampoo Free trade Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Wal-Mart Plame affair Coeliac disease Clomipramine Health insurance Digital photography Western blot Houseplant Gross domestic product Social rule Cheating in Counter-Strike Prostate cancer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bruxism Arbitrage Hamster Coal

getting cavities filled during pregnancy i have quite a few cavities that i need to get filled and i'm months pregnant i got two filled the other day and the dentist told me that nothing they gave me would affect the baby i called my doctor a few days later just to make sure and they said it was fine but that it's best to wait until after i have the baby to do it if at all possible but she repeatedly told me that if my teeth were bothering me i should go ahead and do it so then i researched it a little online and found that the epinephrine that is combined with the local anesthesia can cause minor birth defects should i wait as far as my insurance goes it would be much better for me to get it done this year but my baby's not due until dec do dentists ever offer to give local anesthesia without epinephrine and what are the minor birth defects that it can cause also will the cavity fillings hurt a lot more without the epinephrine as long as you are out of the first trimester you should be just fine and yes there are anesthetics without epi they do not get you as profoundly numb and do not keep you numb as long but they are definitely an option if you are out of the st trimester and the dentist is aware of the situation and confident i would not worry about it  Pregnancy Local anesthesia Abortion Breastfeeding Miscarriage Dentistry Dental caries Intact dilation and extraction Childbirth Epidural Abortion debate In vitro fertilisation EastEnders Tooth Congenital disorder Spina bifida Cephalic disorder Melanie Wilkes Abortion in the United States Prenatal diagnosis Diabetic retinopathy Dental fillings Caesarean section Tooth enamel Syringomyelia Folic acid Psoriasis Fertility awareness Urinary incontinence Brachial plexus Multiple sclerosis Claire Littleton Acupuncture Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Roe v.

how do i use the baking soda to whiten my teeth each time you are going to brush your teeth dip your damp toothbrush into a bit of baking soda that you've sprinkled onto a paper plate or dish brush your teeth like to would with toothpaste then brush your teeth with regular toothpaste plain baking soda can give you some results for daily stain removal but if you're looking for more dramatic results i recommend getting a whitening treatment i use plus white with their mouth tray there are many different types availalble but the plus white is very low cost yet does a great job i recommend the tray type application because you can let the tray sit in your mouth however long they recommend and the whitener pretty much stays in place with no problem anything else and you run the risk of getting uneven results just follow label directions for whatever type you choose if you have irritated gums or a sore in your mouth don't use a whitener until your irritation is gone if your gums or mouth feel very irritated after use you may be allergic to an ingredient in the whitener let your dentist know the next time you visit his her office that the home treatment was an irritant he she may know of a better alternative that won't irritate the lining of your mouth good luck  Tooth Tooth enamel Toothpaste Dental caries Toothbrush Dental brace Fluoride therapy Halitosis Gingivitis Cocaine Dentistry Bread Plastic Bulk vending Glossitis Domestic rabbit Dental floss Eczema Psoriasis Equine conformation Hydrogen peroxide Chewing gum Customs and etiquette of Japan Coeliac disease Listerine Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence Chocolate Oral cancer Sugar substitute Flour Hypoglycemia Nutmeg Airbag Cuisine of Denmark Hamster Vinegar Fecal incontinence White noise World Series Japanese tea ceremony Orthodontics Wisdom teeth Dentures Audio data compression Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Idli Pneumonia Body piercing Irritable bowel syndrome The Apprentice 2 Methamphetamine Folic acid Hydrochloric acid Upholstery Paracetamol Drill bit Charles Goodyear Menstrual cup Hangul Cosmetic dentistry Houseplant Fugu Dim sum Paint Diamond enhancement Kodocha Crown (dentistry) Vegetarianism Glass Pancake 2000 Australian Grand Prix Mercury(II) chloride Common cold Hash table Bagel American and British English differences Dietary fiber Radiation therapy Carbonated water Tobacco smoking Bruxism Coffee Poker jargon Dental fillings Prostate cancer Gas metal arc welding Jewish cuisine Pizza Hard water Sodium hydroxide Clomipramine Scar Hydroponics Fancy rat Common bean

can i sue my dentist for not letting me know the cons of porcelain veneers i feel cheated i had porcelain veneers done to my front teeth in dec and my teeth are still sensitive after months i can't sleep at night because i feel that i made a big mistake by getting them done in the first place my dentist never warned me that the sensitivity would last this long or that my tooth would have to be shaved down dramatically i found all this out after i got it done i've been doing a lot of research lately and found out that if you have more of your tooth shaved down there would be more trauma to the tooth so more sensitivity i feel that my dentist was not looking out for my best interest because if he were then he would have warned me of the after math and what i would have to go through i don't know what to do in response to the certified dentist above so you are saying that the dentist was at no fault when he obviously knew that by shaving her teeth which were protuding would cause trauma and prolonged sensitivity whether or not this person has a case or not i am not sure but to put all the blame on the patient is absolutely ridiculous who said that she wanted her hand held like a st grader that is a very insensitive and rude response on your part to answer your question julie i am not completely sure about the legal ramifications but i hope you have a case because bastards like these have no right to practice best of luck to you  EastEnders Social rule Dentistry Abortion Plame affair Dental caries Tooth enamel Slander and libel Methamphetamine Chronic fatigue syndrome 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Infantilism Divorce Characters in the Smurfs Autism Baldness Crown (dentistry) Tooth General practitioner Hypnosis False memory Androgen insensitivity syndrome Dentures Dental brace Russian joke AIDS reappraisal Narcissism Bruxism The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Abortion debate Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Karl Rove Stuttering Friends Kurt Cobain Rape Sampling (music) Post-traumatic stress disorder 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Radio Yerevan Ocean's Twelve Wisdom teeth Scientology beliefs and practices Carpal tunnel syndrome 2000 Australian Grand Prix Theory of conduct Dissociative identity disorder Jon Secada Terri Schiavo Transsexuality Coeliac disease Knots Landing Tai Chi Chuan Milton H.

hydrogen peroxide on teeth i heard that you can use it to whiten your teeth is it true how can i get my hands on one is it safe hydrogen peroxide is the main ingredient in dental bleaching solutions it is usually mixed with baking soda and is highly abrasive but does whiten the teeth by removing stains when used accordingly it is also very damaging to the tissue when used excessively or incorrectly your best option would be to discuss this with your dentist and use a professional strength solution that won't damage the enamel or the tissue of your teeth and mouth good luck  Tooth enamel Hydrogen peroxide Tooth Toothpaste Tooth bleaching Dental caries Bleach Mouth ulcer Halitosis Flour Benzoyl peroxide Dentistry Cocaine Organic peroxide Crown (dentistry) Hydrochloric acid Oral hygiene Sodium percarbonate Vinegar Methamphetamine Peroxide Cosmetic dentistry Hydrogen Ammonia Hair coloring Bruxism Coeliac disease Disinfection Explosive material Dental fillings Oral sex Sodium hypochlorite Dentures Chemoluminescence Solvent Acetone peroxide Hydrogen chloride Fluoride therapy Sodium perborate Body piercing Acne Skunk Laundry detergent Hydrofluoric acid Drill bit Listerine Paracetamol Trans fat Breathing gas Phosphoric acid Dental brace Sodium hydroxide Dental floss Tattoo Tissue engineering Sterilization (microbiology) Mercury (element) Iron Bread Poison Second Battle of the Atlantic Tooth development Potassium permanganate Halogen Soldering Urine Sulfuric acid Staining (biology) Root canal Carpal tunnel syndrome Toothbrush Water purification Raisin Acetic acid Down syndrome Tetrapod The Dentist Sugar substitute Chewing gum Fluoride Fugu Toffee Hydrogen sulfide Plastic Orthodontics Carbon dioxide Enzyme Haloalkane Rebreather Cancer Arsenic trioxide E number Embouchure M16 (rifle) Breastfeeding Ceramics Dioxin Embalming Catalase Coca-Cola

wisdom teeth i had all four wisdom teeth extracted on monday the swelling has gone down considerably and there's no pain but i noticed my jaw will not open very wide it feels like it literally can't open past a certain point i can just barely fit a toothbrush between my teeth i'm wondering if this is normal and if so how long should my jaw be restricted i believe that it's normal although you'll obviously want to make a phone call to your doctor to double check about your specific situation when i had my wisdom teeth pulled my jaw actually made a clicking sound for a month they have to open your mouth very wide for a long period of time for the surgery so it's not abnormal to have side effects from it the good news is that my jaw went back to normal and so should yours  Tooth Wisdom teeth Equine conformation Embouchure Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Maxilla Dental brace Mandible Orthodontics Face Vowel Sleep apnea Tetrapod Oral and maxillofacial surgery Dentistry Carpal tunnel syndrome Prostate cancer Stem cell The Shining (film) Tooth enamel Drill bit Poker jargon Jaw Sperm Whale Gag (BDSM) Elephant Mouth ulcer Adjustable gastric band Childbirth Temporomandibular joint disorder Stuttering Knife Androgen insensitivity syndrome Milton H.

enamel erosion problems please help also monroe piercing basically i went to the dentist yesterday and he told me i have enamel erosion he has given me special toothpaste to do something to the enamel i have left he said fizzy drinks have caused this i was wondering is this common how can i reduce the loss of enamel i know not drinking fizzy drinks but that is impossible for me also i heard when you have a monroe piercing the enamel gets damaged would it make a difference know that i have enamel erosion problems anyways as i am thinking of having it done plus is there treatment when i am older to replace the enamel thanks once you have eroded away your enamel this will have affected your bite also when you look at your back molars you will see a whitish outer layer with a yellower centre and they will look pretty flat the only way to correct this permanently is to do a full mouth reconstruction of your mouth i e crowns on all your back teeth and probably on the front ones too very expensive you really do need to stop drinking acidic things and avoid eating them too google drinks that eat teeth and acid erosion to find out about your condition the drinks that eat teeth site is a list of carbonated beverages and gives the ph level acidity just bear in mind that neutral the level that does no damage is there are some new toothpastes that can help to strengthen the enamel that you have left and i assume that that is what you were given such as sensodyne's pro namel or enamel care by arm and hammer or mi paste good luck with quitting the pop you now need to make it your mission in life to read the labels on everything you eat and drink and avoid those that have any form of acid close to the beginning of the ingredient list n b if you absolutely have to drink fizzy drinks chug them rather than sipping them or drink through a straw to help bypass your teeth the idea is to limit the number of times acid is in contact with your teeth  Tooth enamel Dental caries Evidence of evolution Fluoride therapy Bruxism Soft drink Mouth ulcer Hydrochloric acid Halitosis Coeliac disease Plastic Hypoglycemia Japanese tea ceremony Insulin Sake Toothpaste Gramophone record Fecal incontinence Tetrapod Fluoride Dentistry Maxilla Body piercing Drill bit Sherbet Corrosion Tire First aid Methamphetamine Rebreather Folic acid Social rule American and British English differences Titanium Explosive material Breastfeeding Alcohol Alcoholic beverage Urinary incontinence Acne Erosion Microeconomics Evolution of the Horse Hamster Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Cheese Ecology Wisdom teeth Opportunity rover Nutrition Alcoholism Coca-Cola Veganism Hearing impairment Unreal Hiccup Guinness Hard water Leaf Motor oil Drowning Stuttering Theory of conduct Tooth development Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Spark plug Loudspeaker Acid Cocaine Aspartame Sugar substitute Omega-3 fatty acid Nine Inch Nails Infantilism Cider Transformer Garlic Shark Chocolate Wayne Corporation Radiation therapy Alcoholics Anonymous Internal ballistics Fancy rat Happy Tree Friends Anorexia nervosa GunBound Alzheimer's disease Dental fillings Star Trek Customizable Card Game Benzene L__gion d'honneur Hangul

is it bad not to have a strong enamel is this what makes your teeth sensitive does whitening your teeth cause these if i drink a cup of milk everyday should that help and does drinking milk help whiten your teeth what helps i was reading the questions and they all said something about fluoride in toothpaste does that mean i should get toothpaste with higher fluoride i know this is alot but if you could just give me any information about anything like this thatd be nice ok here goes what usually makes your teeth sensitive is when your gum line recedes goes down even just a little bit and the cementum the part that covers your root is exposed in your mouth also if some enamel has worn away from your tooth from grinding your teeth and eating sweets the layer underneath called dentin is exposed and has fluid which passes through the tubules like little hollow cylinders and causes sensitivity yes whitening can cause your teeth to become temporarily sensitive drinking milk will only help your bones like your jaw bone strong to keep your teeth nicely in place but what really helps keep your teeth strong is fluoride you can get mouthrinses with fluoride and if you're still young your hygienist should give you a fluoride treatment everytime you get your teeth cleaned although some give it to you at any age fluoride can help reduce sensitivity as well as reduce your likelyhood of getting cavities by strengthening the enamel matrix what enamel is made out of most toothpastes have fluoride in them unless they say otherwise these are usually toothpastes for really young children because if they swallow it it can cause stomach irritation a good toothpaste with fluoride and sensitivity is crest pro health fluoride is also in tap water and not always in bottled water and if there is it is a significantly less amount drinking milk unfortunately will not whiten your teeth you should also be aware that eating things with a high sugar content like orange juice pop any kind of bread potatoes including french fries raisins and so on will eat away at your enamel and make you at greater risk for cavities hope this helps  Fluoride therapy Toothpaste Breastfeeding Mouth ulcer Milk Fecal incontinence Chocolate Russian cuisine Coffee Cocaine Hamster Oral sex Halitosis Maxilla Ivory Dentin Dentistry Soft drink Breakfast Cheese Bruxism Cat Cuisine of Denmark Shark Plastic Chewing gum Oral hygiene Food Gingivitis Tooth development Raisin Methamphetamine Happy Tree Friends Kosher foods Escherichia coli O157:H7 Alcoholic beverage Equine conformation Tooth bleaching Crocodilia Bong Nutrition Pneumonia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Acne Coeliac disease Diarrhea Dairy Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Gastroesophageal reflux disease Hydrogen peroxide Stomach cancer Tofu Drink Vegetarianism Hangover Cosmetic dentistry Veganism German cuisine Tea Rice pudding Esophageal cancer Jewish cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Traumatic brain injury Mandible First aid Drowning Cider Soy milk Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sugar substitute Snake Cuisine of Singapore Honey Diabetes mellitus Dietary fiber Vomiting Gag (BDSM) Cuisine of Brazil Mango Comanche Cuisine of Malaysia Coca-Cola Yoghurt Urinary incontinence Sugar beet

will a teeth whitening procedure last so i haven't had the best teeth infact i'm a little embarrassed of them and wish i could improve their colour they're slightly yellowish and it turns out that's my natural colour and not some stains you can remove with teeth cleaning my local dentist does teeth bleaching for around but only said that it lasts months to a year do these procedures typically last that long what other alternatives do i have that actually work like strips do they make a difference i'm kind of desperate at this point sigh but don't know if i'm willing to pay so much for such a short term thing any help will do the over the counter bleaching strips do help some people it may take more than one box to get a decent amount of change in your color i think what the dentist may mean is that you might need a touch up now and then after you bleach i'm not sure if he is using an at home tray system for you or doing the bleaching all in his office if its an at home tray system all you need to do is buy extra bleach and wear your trays once a month or so most bleaching will last longer than a year in fact i doubt your enamel color will darken to its original color if it does it should take longer than a year we use something in our office called deep bleaching it is a combination of in office sessions and week at home bleaching tray session we have had great success with it and it is supposed to be permanent if followed correctly  Tooth enamel Tooth Textile manufacturing Hydrogen peroxide Tooth bleaching Fluoride therapy Japanese tea ceremony Color Dental brace Drill bit Menstrual cup Color blindness Mattress Flour Poker jargon Surveillance Bleach Acne Nirvana (band) Domestic rabbit Water purification Softball Dentistry Dishwashing Upholstery Incandescent light bulb Dental caries Patent Craps Theory of conduct Turquoise Menstrual cycle Customs and etiquette of Japan CPU cache Technicolor Oral sex Blackjack Laundry detergent Sodium hypochlorite Social rule Goodness and value theory Scientology beliefs and practices Leaf New York Giants Torquay United F.C.

i just got my braces off a few days ago and they gave me my retainer yesterday i was wondering if it is really neccesary to wear the retainer for hours straight for the next few months or is it okay to take it out for a little while for a break i wear it to sleep and usually a few hours during the day is that okay or should i wear it more often you should wear it as much as possible but to be honest with you you will know if your teeth start to move when the retainer is tighter than usual when you put it in at that point you need to wear all the time my daughter has been out of braces for years and she never wore her retainer all the time she would wear it home but never out if she forgot to put it in for a few days she would know it when she did put it in and then just wear it untill it felt right again good luck and be careful after all those years of braces you don't want to have your teeth move back be very observant and you will know  Dental brace Drill bit Social rule Cliff Richard Daylight saving time Shaggy dog story Paul Is Dead Orthodontics Sydney Riot of 1879 Carpal tunnel syndrome Donald Neilson The Ashlee Simpson Show Upholstery Michael Garibaldi New York Giants Nine Inch Nails Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an American and British English differences Mickey Mantle AFI 100 Years series Steven Wright The Citadel (Military College) Good Morning, Vietnam Kurt Angle The Amber Spyglass The Amazing Race The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Frankie Laine Hipparchus (astronomer) Singlish The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Tooth Pitaten USS Waters (DD-115) 613 mitzvot Equine conformation Ethics Charles Peace The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Mattress Tooth enamel Humphrey Bogart Bj__rn Borg Avenue Q Characters in the Smurfs Procrastination Big Brother (Australian TV series) Milton H.

why do some people get freezing at the dentist i just focus on a spot on the wall and don't feel anything i prefer no freezing or gas because then i know what the dentist is doing to me and it doesn't hurt when i look at a spot and think only of it some call it self hypnosis but it works whatever you call it congratulations but not everyone has that ability i had kids without an epidural too but i don't suggest that for everyone in the end it's more important to get the dental treatment than to avoid it because you can't be a tough guy it's the result that's important not how you get there i don't get gas but i do appreciate the numbing gel all the same but i won't fault those who want the gas  Dentistry Hypnosis Epidural Mouth ulcer Anesthesia Transactional analysis Halitosis Milton H.

pain after at home whitening i bought these whitening strips from walgreens i only had them on for minutes supposed to be because my teeth are sensitive to begin with now they hurt with any kind of pressure and it was just the first application but parts of my teeth are super white and other parts aren't affected what gives the whiter spots on the teeth are just dehydrated which is a normal part of the process as the stain is drawn out of the tooth surface and this will go away once the tooth rehdryates if your teeth are already quite sensitive then the dehydration process and opening the pores of the teeth to draw out the stain is probably irritating the nerve of the tooth this sensitivity is even more common in teens which may not apply to you i would recommend to stop the whitening until you use a sensitive toothpaste on a regular basis for a few weeks and see if that helps good luck jamrdh a dental hygienist  Tooth Tooth enamel Dental caries Toothpaste Fluoride therapy Oral hygiene Psoriasis Hydrogen peroxide Oral sex Pneumonia White noise Domestic rabbit Halitosis Mouth ulcer Pain Fecal incontinence Tooth bleaching Gingivitis Dental brace Acupuncture Acne Hamster Chronic fatigue syndrome Cosmetic dentistry Crown (dentistry) Chlorpromazine Mandible Plastic Shark Methamphetamine Female genital cutting Dentistry Color blindness Upholstery Fibromyalgia Allergy Local anesthesia Headache Eye Glycerin First aid Medical prescription Toothbrush Chewing gum Cocaine Wisdom teeth Breastfeeding Dehydration Reflexology Drill bit Normal distribution Listerine Potassium nitrate Certified Nursing Assistant Erogenous zone Penis Coeliac disease Radiation therapy Prostate cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ultraviolet Sleep apnea Breathing gas Urine Bruxism Western blot Nutrition Fluoride Corrosion Dilbert Traumatic brain injury Massage Paget's disease of bone Microeconomics Glossitis Decompression sickness Sperm Whale Childbirth Dental fillings Mercury(II) chloride Dental implant Dentures Explosive material Teen Girl Squad Tuberculosis Eczema Face Foreskin Multiple sclerosis Aloe Ammonia Pulmonary alveolus Magnetic resonance imaging Leaf Hand grenade Urinary incontinence Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Side Characters (Xenosaga)

my jaw is really sore my jaw is sore ive got a cold my jaw pops its been like this for the past days and i've looked up symptoms for tmj that cant be it cos alot of the symptoms dont apply to me i've been in the dental field for years so i know a little bit about what i'm talking about more than likely it is your tmj eventhough a lot of the symptoms don't apply anytime you have clicking or popping in the joint there is some sort of inflammation try taking mg of motrin or advil over the counter but make sure you have some food in your stomach first then apply heat to the area min on and min off for a few hours you may need to do this for several days if you're under a lot of stress you may be clenching or grinding your teeth at night while sleeping this also can cause problems with the jaw tmj you may want to visit your dentist and inquire about a night guard this keeps the teeth slightly apart at night while you are asleep and gives the muscles a break it also helps with people who grind their teeth preventing damage such as cracking or breaking teeth i know this is uncomfortable for you and i sincerely hope you find relief soon take care  Bruxism Mouth ulcer Chronic fatigue syndrome Carpal tunnel syndrome Tooth Orthodontics Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breastfeeding Methamphetamine Psoriasis Dental caries Tooth enamel Dentistry First aid Equine conformation Stomach cancer Group A streptococcal infection Urinary incontinence Osteoarthritis Social rule Cocaine Gingivitis Neuralgia Coeliac disease Traumatic brain injury Professional wrestling throws Oral and maxillofacial surgery Dentures Asthma Sleep apnea Insomnia Drill bit Mattress Alzheimer's disease Myocardial infarction Tyrannosaurus rex Gout Eczema Fibromyalgia Shark Welding Narcolepsy Halitosis Cramp Pneumonia Dialysis Cancer Dog Paget's disease of bone Crown (dentistry) Manual transmission Fecal incontinence Medicine Gastroesophageal reflux disease Hip fracture Herpes simplex virus Stroke Decompression sickness The Legend of Zelda series enemies Hypertension Radiation poisoning Post Polio syndrome Embouchure Trigeminal nerve Esophageal cancer Milton H.

should i get a gold tooth i have to have a crown on a tooth thats right next to one of my wisdom teeth enamel and gold cost about the same which should i get gold crowns have a better fit they are thinner so they can reduce the tooth less and have good occlusion they can also last longer because they have a better fit around the margins and stand up to mechanical wear in the mouth better gold is usually more expensive by about the gums typically tolerate gold crowns the best less inflammation and bleeding around them porcelain crowns are very natural looking and can also have a great fit they can typically last years sometimes even longer they are less expensive than gold you have to be a bit more meticulous with your flossing to maintain healthy gums around porcelain crowns i would never recommend a stainless steel crown they are not custom made and do not withstand the pressures and biological stresses in the mouth very well the gum tissue is almost always inflamed around stainless steel dental work it depends on whether people seeing it will bother you because even if it's on the second to last tooth if you laugh people will see it but gold will be your best dental investment in my opinion i would say about of the people i work with in the dental field would choose a gold crown hope this helps  Dental caries Tooth enamel Crown (dentistry) Oral hygiene Drill bit Dental fillings Dental brace Dental floss Dentistry Gingivitis Halitosis Welding Breastfeeding Cookware and bakeware Plastic Knife Corrosion Motorcycle Gas metal arc welding Fluoride therapy Transformer Orthodontics Psoriasis Dentures Chronic fatigue syndrome Sawfiler Coeliac disease Terminal ballistics Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cosmetic dentistry Cocaine Bulk vending Radiation therapy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Wisdom teeth Chewing gum Fusion power Insurance Tooth development Dental implant Jet engine Mouth ulcer Glass Diving cylinder Stomach cancer Tetrapod Spark plug De Lorean DMC-12 Bicycle Face Hypoglycemia Bicycle frame Toothpaste Gypsy moth Shark Metallurgy First aid Turbocharger Atherosclerosis Steel Mattress Prostate cancer Stroke Cat Glossitis Wind turbine Nutrition Place of articulation Stainless steel Carpal tunnel syndrome Screw Cartridge (firearms) Carburetor Porcelain Oral cancer Stem cell E85 Microeconomics Tocopherol Tire Hydraulic machinery Acne Ceramics Urinary incontinence Toothbrush Inflation Fountain pen Domestic rabbit Pronunciation of English th Gold as an investment The Dentist Order of Canada Non-native pronunciations of English

root canal molar is a crown needed i am having a root canal on my st molar which is being done by an endodontist my dentist feels that since my tooth is healthy that he will just fill it instead of placing a crown the reason for the root canal is complicated i am wondering should a tooth that is root canaled be crowned since it is a molar i had a root canal on one of my molars a couple years ago and now my dentist wants to put a cap on it as well my dentist was a little confused as to why the endodontist didn't cap it or whatever at the same time or why my dentist didn't do the cap i would think you would want a cap just to make sure your molar stays safe and doesn't break apart since there is no nerve to it there is no way for nutrients to get to it and stuff so it's vulnerable to bacterias and such so i had the root canal on my molar and the dentist that i have now wants to put a cap on it that's so that way the tooth doesn't deteriate however you spell that and break into pieces and what not it's a shield for your molar basically a dental crown is a tooth shaped cap that is placed over a tooth covering the tooth to restore its shape and size strength and or to improve its appearance the crowns when cemented into place fully encase the entire visible portion of a tooth that lies at and above the gum line why is a dental crown needed a dental crown may be needed in the following situations to protect a weak tooth for instance from decay from breaking or to hold together parts of a cracked tooth to restore an already broken tooth or a tooth that has been severely worn down to cover and support a tooth with a large filling when there isn't a lot of tooth left to hold a dental bridge in place to cover misshaped or severely discolored teeth to cover a dental implant  Dental caries Tooth Tooth enamel Dentistry Dental brace Crown (dentistry) Root canal Maxilla Mandible Hangul Bruxism Dental fillings Dentures Wisdom teeth Poker jargon Chronic fatigue syndrome Orthodontics Oral hygiene The Dentist Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Seismic retrofit Temporal bone Dental implant Gingivitis Hand grenade Evidence of evolution Methamphetamine The Legend of Zelda series enemies Naruto jutsu Hat Non-native pronunciations of English Domestic rabbit Drill bit Cocaine Amalgam Oral sex Combine (Half-Life 2) Chewing gum Equine conformation First aid Medical prescription Raisin Manual transmission Aluminium Panama Canal The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap Headgear Plastic Eucalyptus Cosmetic dentistry Theory of conduct Nuclear weapon design Endocarditis Fecal incontinence Stem cell Final Fantasy magic Gastrointestinal tract Carpal tunnel syndrome Rail tracks Certified Nursing Assistant Desert Evolution of the Horse Xenomorph Breastfeeding Singlish Face Electrophysiology Leaf Sawfiler Autonomic nervous system Surgery Nine Inch Nails Mattress God Emperor of Dune Hitler's death Bong Dental floss Sampling (music) Professional wrestling holds Computer security Ceramics Pitaten Serpent Society Negima Dentition African American Vernacular English Scientology beliefs and practices CPU cache Tyrannosaurus rex Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Place of articulation Overkill (band) Mercury (element)

crest whitestrips thinking about using the crest white strips how do you use them you simply dry off your upper and lower front teeth and then place a thin strip on them to wear for hour it is best not to drink eat or talk excessively while using or they may move some gel will get in the mouth but not be harmful to you overall i would say that most of my patient's have had some measure of success with the crest whitestrips some more than others the results are usually pretty quick noticeable in the first few days best in a week or longer our office uses crest supreme which are much stronger than what you can buy in a drugstore and don't cost that much more vs you can purchase the drugstore version but if you can do yourself the favor of using them right after you get your teeth cleaned as any staining and buildup tartar or plaque will impede their ability to work also don't use fluoride toothpaste before putting the strips on same reason the strips are probably your best low price alternative much less than in office whitening or custom trays about i am also hearing happy reviews with the aquafresh whitening trays unlike the strips they don't have the tendency to slip or move all of the methods strips trays custom trays in office whitening have the potential to make your teeth temporarily sensitive but will not harm the enamel if you get sensitive use the product every other day in conjunction with a sensitive tooth toothpaste you might try to drink dark liquids through a straw and don't smoke most whitening toothpastes just remove stain on the surfaces of your teeth and therefore are not so effective whatever method you use it will not whiten your teeth for life as you age your teeth will get darker and may need to be whitened again good luck jamrdh a dental hygienist  Fluoride therapy Tooth Toothpaste Fluoride Hydrogen peroxide Dental brace Oral hygiene Mouth ulcer Plastic Explosive material Cocaine Transformer Tooth bleaching Microeconomics Oral sex Dairy Psoriasis Japanese tea ceremony Equine conformation Inflation Dentures Breastfeeding Maxilla Coffee Supply and demand Cosmetic dentistry Tobacco Bong Drill bit Hamster Insurance Mattress Allergy Crown (dentistry) Textile manufacturing Tetrapod Domestic rabbit Hypoglycemia Western blot Coeliac disease Theory of conduct Coca-Cola Bicycle lighting Insulin Menstrual cup Chewing gum Titanium Chocolate Diamond enhancement Welding Illegal drug trade Sento The Legend of Zelda series enemies Social rule Upholstery Urinary incontinence Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Chronic fatigue syndrome Microphone Poker jargon Deflation (economics) Growth hormone treatment Agarose gel electrophoresis Nutrition Audio data compression Fancy rat Vampire Medical analysis of circumcision Free trade RuneScape weapons Rum Motor oil Corrosion Severe weather terminology (United States) Siphon Food Houseplant Knife Prostate cancer Economics Customs and etiquette of Japan Androgen insensitivity syndrome Pottery IPod Sewage treatment Ultraviolet Overclocking Hygiene

how long should it take for the swelling of an abscessed tooth to go down after starting antibiotics it's been week since i took my boyfriend to the er with an abscessed tooth where they proceeded to open the abscess and drain it they prescribed antibiotics and vicodin which he has been taking religiously he's down to pills left but his poor face is still horribly swollen looks like he has a lemon stuffed in his cheek and he still feels crappy should i take him back to the er or is this normal if they drained all the pus then he should be better by now typically people will start feeling better hours after starting antibiotics for a simple bacterial infection the fact that he's not feeling better suggests that either the bacteria causing the abscess were resistant to the antibiotic that was prescribed or there is still a pocket of abscess somewhere that wasn't drained the abscess gets a thick wall around it that the antibiotics can't penetrate if it has been a week and he really isn't getting any better then i would have someone take a look at him again  Pneumonia Group A streptococcal infection Abscess Cellulitis Antibiotic Mastoiditis Gonorrhoea Psoriasis Penicillin Common cold Meningitis Guinea pig Boil Streptococcus pneumoniae Tuberculosis Tonsil Fancy rat Conjunctivitis Pelvic inflammatory disease Traumatic brain injury Helicobacter pylori Bacteria Antibiotic resistance Dialysis Gangrene Brain abscess Pharyngitis Otitis externa Chronic fatigue syndrome Dysentery Breast Otitis media Inflammation Cystic fibrosis Staphylococcus aureus Virus Lymphogranuloma venereum Prostatitis Ulcerative colitis Iatrogenic Rosacea Vancomycin Diarrhea Mouth ulcer Gingivitis Tooth Clostridium difficile Melioidosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) First aid Breastfeeding Infectious disease Infectious mononucleosis Transformation (genetics) Halitosis Eczema Legionellosis Crohn's disease Shrimp farm Domestic rabbit Plasmid Cephalexin Chancroid Dental caries AIDS Ciprofloxacin Phage Malaria Anthrax Beta-lactam antibiotic Erysipelas Amoxicillin Multidrug resistance Epididymitis Nutrition Body piercing Tofu Medical prescription Bubonic plague Syphilis Methamphetamine Wisdom teeth Diverticulitis Sexually-transmitted infection Capital punishment Nocardia Fistula Chlamydophila pneumoniae Necrotizing fasciitis Dracunculiasis Foodborne illness Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Cholecystitis Urinary incontinence Escherichia coli O157:H7 Livestock Sinusitis

when i eat citrus fruits it gives me a funny taste after in my mouth and my breath smells funny why it should be the opposite because citrus fruits contain citric acid which stimulates saliva flow and saliva keeps the mouth healthy and smelling fresh also citric acid helps to suppress the activity of some odor causing enzymes make sure your tongue is always clean scraped with a tongue scraper if necessary because often tongue coating is a source of bad odour maybe it is your body's way of telling you not to eat them but if you don't have any other problem eating them then continue to do so because they are rich in vitamin c try drinking water directly after swiahin it around the mouth best wishes  Tooth Citric acid Lemon Cat Acid Garlic Citrus Hamster Vitamin Vitamin C Breastfeeding Bong Perfume Nutrition Folic acid Olfaction Milk Gastroesophageal reflux disease Saliva Cheese Oral sex Carbon dioxide Healthy eating Vermicompost Gatorade Domestic rabbit Tofu Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Flavonoid Enzyme Citric acid cycle Biochemistry Dieting Water Flatulence Hypoglycemia Foodborne illness Hiccup Digestion Fugu Antioxidant Durian Apple Vegetarianism Hydrogen sulfide Orange (fruit) Chocolate Dental caries Cocaine Vinegar Psoriasis Sherbet Fecal incontinence Heartburn Mango Mouth ulcer Blackcurrant Omega-3 fatty acid Sulfur Yoghurt Natt__ Ozone Vomiting Tooth enamel Snake Stomach cancer Auxin Gastrointestinal tract Ginger Aloe Rum Kiwifruit Chewing gum Food Tomato Body piercing Salt Coriander Ammonia Phosphoric acid Lime (fruit) Fatty acid Rooibos Food science Mosquito Raw food diet Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Orange juice Skeletal muscle Egg (food) Fancy rat Limonene Onion Cancer

how to make them whiter how can you make your teeth cleaner and whiter i have braces and the thing i am worried about is having marks when i get them off i brush twice a day and even sometimes three times a day though no effect on the teeth i don't want marks on my teeth any suggestions you are actually talking about two different issues here whitening and white spots unfortunately you cannot whiten with braces on the whitening agent will not be able to get under where the brackets have been cemented onto the teeth if you do use a product you run the risk of have different colored rectangles on the center of your teeth when the brackets are removed once you braces are removed have your teeth cleaned and then whiten them sorry i don't have any other options for you however the white spots are caused by plaque that hasn't been cleaned off and has started to cause decay or decalcify the tooth in order to prevent these you should be having regular dental cleanings and checkups you should be brushing very often flossing or using a proxybrush to clean in between the teeth and around the brackets and using an over the counter fluoride rinse like act or fluorigard or using a high concentration fluoride toothpaste prescribed by your dentist or orthodontist to help remineralize build up the decalcified areas susceptible areas so do your home care and some rinsing along with good diet and hopefully you will be ok hope that helps jamrdh a dental hygienist  Tooth Dental caries Tooth enamel Fluoride therapy Dental brace Dentistry Toothpaste Gingivitis Fluoride Halitosis Orthodontics Dental floss Mouth ulcer Methamphetamine Crown (dentistry) Listerine Drill bit Toothbrush Glossitis The Dentist Chewing gum Tooth bleaching Wisdom teeth Cosmetic dentistry Hydrogen peroxide Bracket Sugar substitute Medical prescription Soap Dentures Contact lens Dry cleaning Coeliac disease Upholstery Mercury (element) Oral sex Hygiene Fluorine Acne Prostate cancer Calcium Dental fillings Radon Alzheimer's disease Certified Nursing Assistant Psoriasis Hamster Dental hygienist Chronic fatigue syndrome Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Foodborne illness Mesothelioma Bruxism Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Natural Hygiene Raisin White noise Textile manufacturing Growth hormone treatment Sento Raw food diet Social rule Last Exit to Springfield Cocaine Milton H.

how do i make my teeth white i have braces on right now but in a month im getting them off so how to i make my teeth look very white overall i would say that most of my patient's have had some measure of success with the crest whitestrips some more than others the results are usually pretty quick noticeable in the first few days best in a week or longer our office uses crest supreme which are much stronger than what you can buy in a drugstore and don't cost that much more vs you can purchase the drugstore version but if you can do yourself the favor of using them right after you get your teeth cleaned as any staining and buildup tartar or plaque will impede their ability to work also don't use fluoride toothpaste before putting the strips on same reason the strips are probably your best low price alternative much less than in office whitening or custom trays about i am also hearing happy reviews with the aquafresh whitening trays unlike the strips they don't have the tendency to slip or move all of the methods strips trays custom trays in office whitening have the potential to make your teeth temporarily sensitive but will not harm the enamel if you get sensitive use the product every other day in conjunction with a sensitive tooth toothpaste you might try to drink dark liquids through a straw and don't smoke most whitening toothpastes just remove stain on the surfaces of your teeth and therefore are not so effective whatever method you use it will not whiten your teeth for life as you age your teeth will get darker and may need to be whitened again also wait a few weeks after your braces are off so the gums which often get swollen with the braces on a chance to shrink back to normal and of course have them cleaned first you don't want any cement that is left over to block the whitener good luck jamrdh a dental hygienist hope that helps  Tooth Fluoride therapy Dental caries Toothpaste Dental brace Halitosis Oral hygiene Hydrogen peroxide Plastic Dentistry Drill bit Cocaine Chewing gum Transformer Upholstery Mouth ulcer Tooth bleaching Oral sex The Apprentice 2 Allergy Gingivitis Equine conformation Prostate cancer Psoriasis Crown (dentistry) Explosive material Cosmetic dentistry Methamphetamine Social rule Poker jargon Corrosion Growth hormone treatment Chronic fatigue syndrome Inflation Dairy Insurance Breastfeeding Titanium Dentures Acne Ultraviolet Domestic rabbit Bong The Dentist Knife RuneScape weapons Insulin Cancer Mattress Rum Fancy rat Wal-Mart Dental floss Raisin Tobacco Bulk vending Woodworking Textile manufacturing Bicycle lighting Sento Supply and demand Bruxism Water purification Audio data compression Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Wisdom teeth Hamster Clinical depression Stroke Diamond enhancement Magnetic resonance imaging Coeliac disease Urinary incontinence Acupuncture Homeopathy Food Sewage treatment Deflation (economics) Plame affair Coca-Cola Menstrual cup Short selling Normal distribution Nutrition Maxilla Theory of conduct Mesothelioma Bretton Woods system Japanese tea ceremony Arbitrage Medical analysis of circumcision Abortion debate Certified Nursing Assistant 2000 Australian Grand Prix

is it possible to only have braces on my bottom teeth the orthodontist said i only need braces on my bottom teeth but i think its kinda odd only having braces on the bottom teeth also my top teeth arent the best ones in the world yes this is possible and might even look better than having braces on the top and the bottom your bottom teeth might be so out of place that you are not biting down properly but if you're top teeth are just a little out of place there is no real reason for braces unless you really want them and are willing to pay for them  Dental brace Orthodontics Drill bit Dentistry Gag (BDSM) Barbed wire Jaws (James Bond) PostScript Timber framing X86 assembly language Scoliosis Embouchure Canoe Barque Combine harvester Manual transmission Yardarm Bracket Tooth Hangul The Football League Zipper Skinhead Poker jargon Woodworking Phase-shift keying Sail-plan Stanley Cup Equine conformation Cheating in poker Trapping Overall Chris Benoit Trousers Counter 2 (number) Harp Muslim ibn Aqeel Crown (dentistry) Rich Mullins Freddie Mercury BDSM Netsuke Light-frame construction C syntax File (metalwork) Uncanny Valley Heraldry Zits Squidward Tentacles 1986 National League Championship Series Torquay United F.C.

swelling after root canal i had a broken lower molar that started to act up the past couple weeks a dull aching pain i went to the dentist and he recommended i save the tooth get a root canal and crown the tooth he is not able to finish the root canal and puts a temp seal on my tooth and has scheduled me to come back in to complete the root canal on monday about hours after the root canal my cheek and lower jaw started to swell up it now is almost a golf ball size swelling the dentist did not indicate there was an infection but did provide me motrin and antibiotics i've been taking both and icing the swelling which is pretty tender so far it hasn't gotten any bigger but not any smaller either should i be worried so it is getting a bit worse now i called my dentist and he said to wait overnight and let the antibiotics kick in he said he really doesn't want to open it up to expose it i demanded he see me today and i have an appointment in hours it seems as though it is progressing towards me eye what a day dentist opened it up cleaned it out recapped it went to the er they did a ct scan of me and found that i had no absess caused by the tooth i only had swelling and most likely the root of the infection may have been at the injection sites they put me on an iv and pumped antibiotics clindamycin and prescribed me some i don't have a fever my jawbone is fine and i don't have an elevated white blood cell count so they let me go and said the antibiotics should do the trink oh and they pumped me with morphine times for the pain i'm feeling a bit better now and the swelling is starting to slowly subside yay absolutely get he tooth opened up immediately i am a dentist the bacteria is causing a huge infection and unless you treat it now the infection will travel farther the dentist should have left the toot open to drain and by not cleaning it all out an infection has presented itself the only reason you are not in huge pain is because of the antibiotics the swelling is not a good sign and you need care asap if not sooner call and go now this can not wait if you have any other questions please ask marie  Group A streptococcal infection Wisdom teeth Tooth Chronic fatigue syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma First aid Tuberculosis Dental caries AIDS Mouth ulcer Gonorrhoea Traumatic brain injury Dialysis Cellulitis Radiation therapy Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Rocky Mountain spotted fever Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Intravenous therapy Electrophysiology Acne Infectious mononucleosis Psoriasis Babe Ruth Conjunctivitis Root canal Dentistry Breastfeeding Maxilla Anthrax Hip fracture Diarrhea Common cold Antibiotic Fancy rat Multiple sclerosis Medical prescription Obstetrics Bubonic plague Weight training Pharyngitis Cocaine Penicillin Carpal tunnel syndrome Stomach cancer Mandible Malaria Abortion Gout Syphilis Domestic rabbit Myocardial infarction Rheumatic fever Virus Tooth enamel Guinea pig Herpes simplex virus Tenshinhan Needle aspiration biopsy Sickle-cell disease Diabetes mellitus Intraocular lens Textile manufacturing Fecal incontinence Body piercing Paget's disease of bone Chlorpromazine Helicobacter pylori Cephalexin Diabetic retinopathy The Dentist Ehrlichiosis Hepatitis Methamphetamine Shark Intracranial pressure Allergy Social rule Urinary incontinence HIV test Asthma Cystoscopy Lymphogranuloma venereum Shock Rosacea Ebola Clindamycin Leukemia Lupus erythematosus

why do i have nose pain after dental x rays i recently went to the dentist she took a full series of mouth x rays and almost immediately afterwards i had a kind of burning feeling inside of my nose from about the mid nose all the way up to under the bridge of my nose i feel like my nose has been crisped dried out and sunburned inside it's really unpleasant but not intolerably painful one of the x rays she took was from the bottom of my chin and pretty much pointing directly up my nose i can't think of anything else that would've caused this since my nose hasn't been traumatized in any other way should i be concerned about the burning sensation inside my nose or should i just wait for it to subside and cancerous growths to form inside my nose anyone else ever experience this all xray units are required to be inspected regularly so it should be functioning correctly it would be possible to overexpose the xrays these would be so dark as to be unusuable you would know that these were incorrect because they would have to be redone the amount of radiation needed to overexpose the film is much less that the amount to burn you is is possible you are allergic to latex the personnel undoubtably wore gloves which could be latex lips tingling burning or a face rash would be common reactions that doesn't mean the nasal passages couldn't show up as the site of the reaction some of my patients have confirmed or suspected latex allergies we use non latex products in those cases you may want to consider that for further proceedures another cause of the nose issues would be that you are instructed to breathe through your nose if you were hyperventalating who wouldn't with a ton of stuff gagging you the nasal passages will get dried out and be very irritated that should resolve pretty quickly  Tattoo Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Allergy Psoriasis Urinary incontinence Hay fever Coeliac disease Common cold Clomipramine Carbon dioxide Strap-on dildo Aspartame Prostate cancer Breastfeeding Enzyme Diving Tobacco smoking Drowning Medicine Methamphetamine Carpal tunnel syndrome Chronic fatigue syndrome Anesthesia Food allergy Traumatic brain injury Hypoglycemia Conjunctivitis Multiple sclerosis Vowel Condom Cephalic disorder Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Menstrual cup Nuclear power Multiple chemical sensitivity Equine conformation Cat Nasal congestion Oral sex Body piercing Radiation therapy Bleeding Mouth ulcer Post-traumatic stress disorder Crohn's disease Domestic rabbit Casting Eczema Stuttering The Caves of Androzani Plutonium Stomach cancer Cancer Triage Food Air pollution Pain Ebola Rash First aid Jala neti Medical prescription Dehydration Ionizing radiation Lung cancer Wisdom teeth Safe sex Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Spina bifida Anal sex Trazodone Nose Syphilis Herpes zoster Eye Rosacea LSD Scar Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Asthma Tokusatsu Poker jargon Tooth Endometriosis Plame affair Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Narcissism Mercury (element) Mobile phone radiation and health Gastroesophageal reflux disease Hip fracture

another wisdom tooth question whats normal for wisdom teeth that grows unimpacted i can't find anything online about whats normal for healthy wisdom teeth that grows in and has enough space its very annoying i have no medical and can't afford to go in and pay bills if theres no reason to go in i just am really starting to overly stress so hopefully someone can help me im usually very good at handling pain but this pain is quite intolerable at times i have a wisdom tooth and it clearly has enough room coming in but theres flaps of flesh covering the half closest to the back is that normal when i pull it back there is weird tasting blood coming out but just a lil bit is that normal is it normal for the flesh to be somewhat red from the crown under it or an infection from food debris my mouth has a hard time opening at times but its not really that swollen the pain is pretty contant but dissappears at times there is a hard dot like thing around the white stretch mark like flesh at the very back above the wisdom tooth at the arch thanks for taking the time what you're describing is called an operculum and it is a flap of gum tissue that covers the erupting tooth the flap of gum traps food particles and can become inflamed and infected it's not normal but it occurs frequently it is hard to keep clean because of this too if the tooth is erupting in a good position and there is enough room for it in your mouth then a dentist may be able to remove the flap of gum a small surgical procedure and this will allow the tooth to erupt fully and stop the infection in the mean time get a syringe from the pharmacy with a blunt ended needle and syringe under the flap with warm salty mouth rinse tsp salt in cup of warm hot water or use savacol mouthwash in the syringe to keep it clean don't poke around it and try not to be too rough when you brush if the infection gets worse and you notice a bad taste smell get some antibiotics ideally see you dentist http www providence org healthlibrary contentviewer aspx hwid hw servicearea generic  Tooth Wisdom teeth Mouth ulcer Halitosis Dental caries First aid Intravenous therapy Tooth enamel Cat Oral hygiene Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Body piercing Dentistry Domestic rabbit Endocarditis Prostate cancer Fancy rat Traumatic brain injury Abortion Breastfeeding Tattoo Stomach cancer Leaf Dentures Chronic fatigue syndrome Dental brace Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Shark Carpal tunnel syndrome Penis Urinary incontinence Bong Kidney Common cold Psoriasis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Snake Needle aspiration biopsy Hamster Al-Razi Diarrhea Guinea pig Carnivorous plant Fugu Knife Cellulitis Cancer Autopsy Foodborne illness Medical prescription Aortic dissection Earwax Menstrual cup AIDS Milton H.

when the dentist decides to do an extraction instead of a root canal i'm in terrible tooth pain since yesterday i'm waiting for my dentist to call me to go to his office i know that i need a root canal in that tooth but i feel that i must have an infection because the pain just spread all over my face isn't it better to extract the tooth he is going to kill the nerve in the root canal anyways when is better one instad of the other i hate toothaches i had two root canals by the time i was years old mostly due to braces both teeth were in the very back well if you don't want your teeth to shift and perhaps grow together crooked if you extract your teeth try not to have it extracted unless neccessary but it's up to you and your doctor what ever is safer to your health once he drills into the tooth only then can he tell the severity of it if the decay has completely engufled your teeth and nurves there is little hope left for it and an extraction is necessary to get the decay removed an infection can easily be cured with antibiotics  Dentistry Dental caries Root canal Tooth Chronic fatigue syndrome Dental brace Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Wisdom teeth Methamphetamine Tooth enamel Surgery Intact dilation and extraction The Dentist First aid Bruxism Domestic rabbit Anesthesia Orthodontics Drill bit Prostate cancer Stomach cancer Carpal tunnel syndrome Diarrhea Maxilla Mouth ulcer Crown (dentistry) Cocaine Medical prescription Tuberculosis Herpes simplex virus Stem cell Procrastination Gonorrhoea Pneumonia Sexually-transmitted infection Ebola Conjunctivitis Traditional Chinese medicine Hepatitis C Hydrogen peroxide Malaria Abortion Intravenous therapy Fecal incontinence Fancy rat Endocarditis Guinea pig Common cold The Two Doctors Traumatic brain injury Lead Eczema Gingivitis Oral sex Trigeminal nerve Breastfeeding Medical cannabis Shaggy dog story Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Antibiotic Otitis externa Local anesthesia Endometriosis Kuja Lupus erythematosus Skin of Evil (TNG episode) Cephalexin Episodes of Lost (Season 1) YuYu Hakusho Syphilis Perfume Smallpox Oral hygiene Milton H.

what does the shot feel like when they have to numb your tooth to prepare for dental work i have to get fillings on monday and a root canal sometime after that i just want to know what it feels like because i'm petrified ok i just had that exact same thing done like hours ago the numbing medicine isn't bad because first they put a q tip on the area where the numbing needle goes with this numbing liquid so you can't even feel the needle go in they tend to do shot on the outer part of the teeth and one on the inner fillings aren't bad at all after you're numbed you just close your eyes and they go to work drilling and filling i only had to get done today and it took about a half in hour so you'll probably take a couple hors the root canal is a different story i had only root canal and it took almost and a half hours now you definitely don't want to look while they're doing the root canal either ask for some headphones and music or bring you're ipod like i did that way you don't hear the drill they use or the needle that they use to clear the root you'll want to keep your eyes closed because they stick inch long needles in there and then leave them there for x rays and stuff if you feel anything after they numb you just raise your hand or give a little moan and they'll add more after all they are dealing with the nerve of your tooth and the very roots of it there's going to be lots of pushing and pulling but it doesn't hurt you just feel the pressure honestly the worst part for me was the assistant who was going to town with the thing that suck the saliva out of your mouth with the vacuum honestly just bring your ipod clothes your eyes and it will be over before you know it i was freaking out too and it wasn't half as bad as my mind made it out to be  Tooth Textile manufacturing Drill bit Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Time Out of Mind Naruto jutsu Dental caries The Inside Carpal tunnel syndrome Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Poker jargon Shaggy dog story Carburetor Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina EastEnders Strap-on dildo Campfire Milton H.

my dentist says i have no more cavities all the fillings are in when i was eating apple sauce on my left side the top part of my teeth on the left side feel pain i don't think there's a cavity is it possible that i have a wisdom tooth on top that is hurting my left side i'm not sure if i should go to a walk in emergency visit or not although this may be very concerning you can wait to have your dentist address this issue going to the er or walk in will cost you a pile of money and a bunch of time and they will tell you to call your dentist tomorrow since they have little to no dental expertise if you finished having new fillings recently in that area the tooth could be sensitive because the nerve of the tooth was irritated in the process also the dentist might need to adjust your bite usually the sensitivity will start out right after the filling and then get better over time hope that helps jamrdh a dental hygienist  Tooth Dental caries Dentistry Dental fillings Tooth enamel The Dentist Dental brace Oral hygiene Methamphetamine Gingivitis Maxilla Crown (dentistry) Dental hygienist Dentures Fluoride therapy Bruxism Oral sex Root canal Chronic fatigue syndrome Pain Acupuncture Erogenous zone Coeliac disease Mandible Fecal incontinence National Health Service Mouth ulcer Medical prescription Amalgam Hitler's death Tofu Dental floss CPU cache Wisdom teeth Local anesthesia Nine Inch Nails Little Shop of Horrors Journey (band) Halitosis Breastfeeding My Family (television) First aid Vernon Schillinger Muslim ibn Aqeel Raisin Shark Orthodontics Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Pneumonia Trigeminal nerve Clomipramine Pubic hair Toothpaste Traumatic brain injury Glen Jacobs Vomiting Casting Surgery Food Milton H.
