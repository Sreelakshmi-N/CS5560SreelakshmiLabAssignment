why do some women like to physically abused by men not me i take it personally when hit by anyone there are men and women whose sexual preferences include surrendering to members of the opposite sex and there are men and women who prefer to be sexually dominating this sort of thing often includes coproral punishment but it's not really abuse in such cases it's an agreed upon activity in which two people with kinky inclinations mutually indulge one another one might argue that it's not healthy but it just doesn't qualify as abuse abusive people treat others as hated objects and seem unsatisfied unless their victims feel truly denigrated and loathed there are lots of strange sexual preferences out there the ones that involve corporal punishment seem a lot tamer than the ones involving feet and unusual bodily fluids from having worked with abusers male and female i've noticed that some of them will pair off with their opposite equivalents emotionally abusive women will sometimes pair off with physically abusive or intimidating controlling men because no one else will have them and the same thing brings the men into relationships with emotionally abusive women there are also men and women with low self esteem who pair off with abusive domineering members of the opposite sex in both cases the relationships can be astonishingly tenacious low self esteem is one factor but the unfamiliarity of dealing with normal partners seems also involved sometimes more balanced people can seem dull to someone inured to abuse and some abuse victims lack confidence that they are capable of measuring up to the behavioral expectations of healthier partners and feel more comfortable that they'll always be good enough for their partners and of course the abuse itself exacerbates any self esteem or self confidence deficits that someone brings into a relationship but i think it's incorrect to say that anyone likes being abused it's a lot more complicated than that  Domestic violence Human sexual behavior Infantilism Sexual orientation BDSM Gender role Zoophilia Child sexuality Rape Child sexual abuse Pedophilia Paragraph 175 Divorce Childlove movement Polyamory Sadism and masochism Narcissism Sexual attraction Transgender Anal sex Homophobia Sex Anger management Transsexuality Domination & submission (BDSM) Spanking Abortion debate Heterosexuality Inhibited sexual desire Gender-neutral language Bondage (BDSM) Birth control Serial killer Sexual addiction Homosexuality and transgender Physical attractiveness Fathers' rights Gay slang Gay Masturbation Human sexuality Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Drug addiction Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Traumatic brain injury Orgy Marriage Microeconomics Human Ephebophilia Asperger syndrome Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Bisexuality Sexual dysfunction Dissociative identity disorder Self-esteem Theory of conduct Physical intimacy Social rule Friendship Mojave people Reparative therapy Polygamy History of sex Phone sex Sexual intercourse Sexual abstinence Bully Post-traumatic stress disorder Orgasm Women in Islam Incest Prostate cancer Oral sex Statutory rape Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Medical analysis of circumcision Sexual abuse Homosexuality Interpersonal relationship Political correctness Economic inequality Alignment (role-playing games) History of intersex surgery Supply and demand Autism Group sex Children of God Age of consent Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Dead Like Me Paraphilia Spousal abuse Trafficking in human beings

is it really fair to say that men couldn't possibly stand the pain of childbirth if they were to go through it wouldn't they just step up to the pain because it had to be done the same as women do i'm going to copy and paste my answer from a similar past thread men may not be able to give birth but plenty of men have endured other probably even more traumatic experiences who do you think the vast majority of soldiers and warriors throughout human history have been men but of course getting an arm hacked off your face whacked with a spiked mace bullets to the gut your flesh ripped up by shrapnel or your skin burned with mustard gas is nothing compared to the pain and trauma of pregnancy and birth right whenever i hear this argument that giving birth requires some kind of special resilience that only woman can have i feel like slapping the people who say it for their stupidity go talk to the men who fought in the trenches of wwi or survived the bataan death march and tell them how they couldn't possibly take the strain of pregnancy  Childbirth Trench warfare Pregnancy Abortion Post-traumatic stress disorder Psoriasis Miscarriage Darth Vader Human Simone Weil Adoption Theodicy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Circumcision Human sexual behavior Side Characters (Xenosaga) EastEnders Clothing Medicine Goodness and value theory Comanche Left-handed Unreal Fecal incontinence Magneto (comics) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bataan Breech birth Reincarnation Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Too Short a Season (TNG episode) World War I Sin City Torture Tank Obstetrics Birth control Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Chemical warfare Spina bifida Free trade Doom enemies Sexual dysfunction Transsexuality Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Blood (computer game) Condom Urinary incontinence Ammunition Tank classification Romulus and Remus Professional wrestling match types Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Wolfrider Poker jargon Irish Guards Nazi human experimentation Carpal tunnel syndrome Earring Terminal ballistics Doctor (Doctor Who) Hand grenade Naruto jutsu Aortic dissection Major League Baseball television contracts Sant Mat Hera Equine conformation Crucifixion Smallpox Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) The Invisibles Masturbation Double bass Kain (Legacy of Kain) Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Cytomegalovirus Total war Pok__mon Abilities Theory of conduct Hearing impairment Wolverine (comics) Rape Dragons (Pern) Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle RuneScape quests Tool (band) Vampire Non-lethal force K' Coeliac disease Pre- and perinatal psychology

why do so many men seem to think a woman's utimate goal in life is to be attractive to men i've seen questions today regarding this one asking about men's pink flag reaction to a woman indicating she is a feminist the other dictating how men are so fervently unattracted to powerful and successful women in my eyes this is the patriarchy at work honey don't hold those beliefs or your stock goes down as if our stock should be determined by men who should dictate what is and what is not attractive why do you get to decide what is or is not either way why on earth should we give a rats a what attracts you should men adhere their lives and beliefs simply because that's what attracts women serious answers please seriously what is it you are hoping to hear oh yessir i'ma so sorry my identity is unattractive to you sir allow me to sell out to what you want because after all that is what's most important you big strong man you lmao riiight jackal the ego maniacal essence at work yessir my beauty regiment is of course for your need to look at something beautiful uh huh yeah lol this is too funny in the spirit of equality yes steve you are probably right i focused on men however because of the questions i referenced that were posted today thanks for the reminder talks to self remember objectivity girly remember objectivity vah more than likely you have posted trolling questions before and were added to my blocked list along with all the other trolls kendrick very cute the debate at hand is women's attractivness not attraction but you boys just can't wait to get those lesbian digs in can you care to contribute to the actual question or are your cough comical cough cough quips all you are able supply kendrick your attempt is pathetic at best to avoid your original statement i thought you would have left it out in case you go back to edit it i have taken the liberty of copying it if you aren't sexually attracted to men what indication is there of this the statement implies alternative sexual attraction thereby homosexuality the offense was not taken by this term lol funny you would assume that the offense was taken that you seem to think that it is who i am attracted to that is in question while it is inherently not it is who i intend to attract or better the lack thereof nice try though again care to address the actual question wow jonmc lol you gave me a good laugh thank you lol heres your evidence sweetie http answers yahoo com question index ylt asihg p g v mcka suur sy ix qid aajamhr show profile info aa http answers yahoo com question index ylt ak slfh iersz ljpz tsfty ix qid aama rm show profile info h rwimfqaa and lastly please do not embarass yourself by attempting yet another act of posession i'm am not now nor have i ever been anyone's girly mcfemale jonmc whispers psst your superiority complex is showing it's really funny this should be posted i've talked to more guys in the past few weeks that seem to think that all women dress themselves in the morning for the pleasure of men they think that we consider them when making every choice and assume that everything we do is for them and all about them you would think that most would have realized by now how unattractive this mindset is to any female who's not a bimbo  Sexual orientation Gender role Human sexual behavior Internet troll Social rule Transsexuality Feminism Little Britain Abortion debate Intelligent design B3ta Meaning of life Theodicy Theory of conduct A Course In Miracles Goodness and value theory Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Extreme Programming Biology and sexual orientation Neuro-linguistic programming Homosexuality Married... with Children 2channel Human Lesbian Free will Homosexuality and Christianity Heteronormativity Shaggy dog story Same-sex marriage Religion and sexual orientation Scientology beliefs and practices Gender-neutral language Homophobia Alcoholics Anonymous Reincarnation Plame affair Opportunity rover Epistemology Goatse.cx Slashdot subculture Friends Cliff Richard Simone Weil Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Reparative therapy Slashdot trolling phenomena Gay God and gender Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Religious Society of Friends Intelligent design movement Iago Internet slang Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Socrates Effeminacy Coercion The nature of God in Western theology Ten Commandments Franz Boas CPU cache Gay slang Joke Domestic violence Civil rights Human nature Postmodernism Anarchism Homosexuality and Judaism William Shakespeare Child sexual abuse Trinity Sigmund Freud Kyle Broflovski English grammar Masculism Agnosticism Atheism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity RuneScape quests 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Mutual fund Bisexuality Evil Philosophical skepticism Expert system Fundamentalism Hiberno-English Economics

registering potential fatherhood to protect men's rights to child in case of underhanded adoption the state of virginia's social services department recently passed a law asking men to voluntarily notify the state when they have had sex with a woman so that if in the event of pregnancy and adoption the state will have record of potential fathers and be able to notify the man so that he may consent to adoption of his child an interesting side note of this is that the child support offices will have access to the records although they will not establish paternity another interesting thing is that fornication sex between unmarried adults is a misdemeanor in virginia so i guess by asking men to register the state is also asking them to cop to a crime rarely enforced but nonetheless a crime if fathers don't file the paperwork they give up their right for the state to inform them about a possible adoption or if they've lost their parental rights if the form contains the address of the woman she will be notified what are your thoughts on this http www roanoke com news roanoke wb state officials said the public does not have access to the registry the information also is not available through the freedom of information act harris said the problem with this law is the focus is in the wrong place plus they won't have enough manpower to file in some database a list of everyone who had unmarried sex just last saturday much less making this an ongoing database i think the state would be better served to require all women wanting to give a child up for adoption obtain a waiver from the father of the child before the woman may give up that child for adoption i've seen too many adoptions annulled because the woman had a one night stand with a guy got pregnant then gives the child up for adoption the man later finds out he has a child wants to raise his child and the state has no choice but to give the child to the father regardless of the time the child has spent with the adoptive family i don't know what they will do when they genuinely don't know who the father is but they should have thought about this before they had sex with a guy shouldn't they fathers' rights are important also does the law address what happens when a woman is raped  Marriage Divorce Abortion debate Fathers' rights Same-sex marriage Abortion in the United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Roe v.

why do some people on here like to spread hate make their gender look bad to the other i was just wondering why they feel that their time is best spent by spreading hate ignorance trying to hurt people to be honest i just roll my eyes at them but isn't there something more constructive they could be doing because all they really acheive is to make themselves that which they represent look really bad are they purposely trying to help the side that they say they oppose when did i mock white men in a question i asked i mocked some guy whining about how men are oppressed i find it odd that that could even be considered since men hold of the positions of power wow it's funny how defense a certain group is getting as i didn't even say a gender or how hate is being spread i think some people have a guilty conscience lol no jackal not that time of the month i'm actually pregnant so do you wanna make a crack at that i know how you like to harass pregnant women i've seen you over in the pregnancy section many a time hey i'm not even upset about it not nearly as upset as some of the people i'm referring to and i do have a life btw i just happen to be stuck at work right now between projects so i thought i'd ask a real question not some stupid gender bashing rant like so many on here do oh and btw i wasn't jsut talking about the misogynists i actually had a few misandrists in mind too but hey all i get is insulted by the misogynists will someone actually answer the question no delicious you weren't who i had in mind for us women i was thinking well for example a certain person who calls herself after a flower that used to always ask why do of men as for bein in denial the only women i see that fall under those stereotypes are on tv none of the women i know are anything like the stereotypes well it is the trolls i'm asking about i just don't get their mentality or lack thereof kendrick you honestly think that the majority of man wh res not men the ones who sleep around with different women every day would sign up to take responsibility for a kid from one of their one night stands honestly that's not 'hate' that's the truth and if women who sleep around could do the same thing i'm sure they would shadow soldier if you read that i said nothing about white or any other color and it was in response to a long winded misogynistic over generalized ridiculous question that painted men as totallly helpless innocent victims of society shadow soldier don't get your boxers in a bunch w i t t w e isn't white it was meant as baby talk for little and i said men are in control no mention of white can you read and by that i meant they hold of the positions of power president vp etc ok kendrick i'm wrong all those people who have one night stands are all ready to jump up volunteer to take responsibility for a kid that resulted none of the women would have abortions and none of the men would do anything but make sure they can be found is that better sheesh happy bullet that's a valid opinion and i'm glad you contributed in such a civilized manner thanks people who spread hate and ugliness about their gender are often very angry and disappointed with their lives and think that what their life is like is what it is like for everyone else of their gender so they resort to using their life experiences as facts and or use gender stereotypes to make themselves feel better by putting others down it's petty childish and immature at best and sick and disturbed at worst and you're right you didn't state either gender yet look at how many people assumed you were talking about them or their gender lol it only takes a few defensive hostile people to create a nasty environment it's easy to blame and hate others it takes time responsibility and work to try to be fair  Theory of conduct Internet troll Social rule Friends EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Abortion debate Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Plame affair Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Knots Landing Hip hop rivalries Avenue Q Media and ethnicity The Inside Futurama (TV series -

why can't women accept the reality that men don't care how successful a woman is if you look at my last to questions you will see that a number of women insist that men are attracted to successful powerful independent women sorry but that is just not true by the way since when are women the authority on what a man is attracted to accept it women your success will either hurt your chances of attracting a good man or do nothing but it will never improve your chances thats just how it is of course there are exceptions but the same goes for men who like really really fat women rare if given a choice they will take the skinnier woman men are not attracted to successful women never have been never will be women are not attracted to bums same thing p s i'm not talking about 'intelligence' just power success money not all intelligent women are high achievers delicious the men who like career women are the men who need an extra income but they still don't want a woman like oprah seriously how many men what to date oprah see her success means nada you are right in that men who are attracted to intelligent women are not as concerned with how successful they are as how their intelligence shows itself an attractive mind can make for the beginnings of a great relationship however men are attracted to intelligent women who are also successful and i don't see how being successful can hurt my chances in a relationship so you find women attractive regardless of how successful they are based on other factors that's nice  Oprah Winfrey Social rule Meaning of life Jon Secada A Course In Miracles Game show Brian Griffin Theory of conduct Gender role Simone Weil Physical attractiveness Sexual orientation Gay Tom Cruise Human height Friends Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Plame affair Dating game show The Critic Infantilism Human Enrique Iglesias Germaine Greer Television syndication Seinfeld Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Desperate Housewives Emotions (album) Sinfest Humphrey Bogart Delta Goodrem Third party (United States) Abortion debate SAT Urantia Mississippi John Hurt Ontological argument Prostate cancer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Have I Got News For You Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Wedge strategy Domestic violence The Apprentice 2 Reality Phillip E.

why are women most intelligent than men if you say because we are special then you are clearly dumb i should think it's because the female brain is able to multi task while the male brain functions in a linear way this was very useful in primitive times when men would need to focus solely on tracking and hunting meat for long periods of time and needed to develop a strong linear focus to keep motivated the women would remain in camp home tending to a vast variety of tasks while the men were away including maintaining small crops fishing making mending clothes as well as child rearing etc so needed to develop a powerfully multi tasking brain for success these male and female traits are still with us today men display their linear focus in work and war women tend to be more creative flexible thinkers due to their natural multi task ability which can help expand intelligence  Intelligence quotient Intelligence (trait) Whale Human Artificial neural network Gender role Physical attractiveness Human brain Tank classification Dyslexia Motivation Dog Second language acquisition Computer Strap-on dildo Leadership Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Asperger syndrome Dynamical system Veganism Stone Age Terminal ballistics General intelligence factor Psychology Comanche Eye Canadian Coast Guard Mach kernel Working memory History of intersex surgery Stuttering Digital photography Game programmer IBM PC compatible Strategic management Race and intelligence Sociocultural evolution Equine conformation Knife Urinary incontinence Clothing Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Sex and intelligence Eugenics Salic law Ostrich W.

how many women here disagree with feminism i'm personally against it and believe in humanism because mens rights are violated also hence men die sooner all i will say is that i for one have never asked to have my bra burned it has always irritated me that a group of women got together and changed the world for everyone i think that women should have rights of course but the ripples of the early feminists have generated a society where a woman can hardly stay home to raise her kids most households need two incomes debt is higher people live beyond their means kids are running rampant and no longer have other neighborhood kids to play tag with unless it is online virtual tag etc etc etc i could go on and on i never asked for it and i think the world was a better place altogether when women wore skirts i am a mom i have to work my kids are in day care i work to pay day care its a rotten circle rebuttal for the person under me i do not imply that real estate has gone up as a result of women asserting themselves i only state that one drop in a pond can cause a wave at the shore and yes there are a variety of factors this being one of them i do not like the fact that we as a society have a hard time saving money and just buying a car or a house or anything else and financing is a must now as are two income families no feminists didn't drive the prices up themselves but the hounds who watched it happen as all of these women running out and insisting that they need the jobs men have demand is up prices are up lifestyles are up and i didn't ask for any of it myself that is only my opinion i personally believe that i was born about years late i should be a 's mom because i believe more in the ideals of the times as a whole i know every era has its rough spots but it's just how i feel i also feel that the person who commented about me is exactly right in the statement that all women should be who and what they want to be that includes me i only state that the movement has generated a new age from the one before it and i preferred the way life was before that time yes women did work just as hard as men did back then at the home i actually have a job that i really love i make decent money i am divorced and i teach on the side because i enjoy it i am only saying that it would be nice to have the option of not wanting to work if as you say let women do what they want then why don't you let me have my opinion i just liked the way family life was before when women were around to raise their kids i actually do like working i enjoy adult company at work i could stand on a soapbox and state my beliefs for you if you wish but i believe in not beating others up for what they believe and i wish they would respect the same as me i am a secure happy confident woman who manages to balance my work my two kids my handicapped mother and a household very well i am happy in my life because i choose to be and it has nothing to do with any man believe me i only believe in a lot of things for society as a whole and you are right there are a lot more factors than just feminists but nobody has asked those questions yet we are talking about feminists and when i address that question i address the women who stand on boxes that practically try to erase the male sex not strong confident women who choose their own paths in life respect me and i'll respect you by the way i will be voting for hilary and for the right reasons not just because she is a woman and so am i  Abortion debate Theory of conduct Transsexuality Gender role Humphrey Bogart Feminist movement Microeconomics Women in Islam Pitaten Economic inequality Knots Landing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Inflation Feminism Sexual orientation Avenue Q Civil rights Plame affair Meaning of life Laura Schlessinger American individualist anarchism Woman Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Gold standard Transgender Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Gender-neutral language EastEnders Fathers' rights History of women in the United States Same-sex marriage History of intersex surgery Domestic violence Supply and demand Infantilism 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Masculism Estoppel One Tree Hill (TV series) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rosa Parks Human sexual behavior Rick Santorum Deflation (economics) Generation X Hyperinflation Contract Fahrenheit 9/11 High-heeled shoe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Strap-on dildo Keynesian economics U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Polyamory Sharon Tate Tag Homemaker The Jam Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Ann Coulter The Apprentice 2 Same-sex marriage in Canada Economics Grandview, U.S.A.

what are problems faced by the working women in their work places well i am a teacher which very much caters to women's needs i don't think that my problems like holding pee for hours are quite the same as those of many other women however i was surprised to learn that where i teach does not offer paid maternity leave most schools now do this however i work in a small district that and about that's of the staff either had children last year or announced they were pregnant yes there were many jokes about dont drink the water so this would be a huge expence for the district being a small district they get many young teachers who have children where as many bigger districts get more experenced older teachers who are less likely to have children as for personal issues its hard to put women in a building and tell them all to get along i have never personally had issues with anyone but i have been there when others did and was there for the venting i have found that a oh really she did or i see keeps me out of a lot of the hoopla  Education in the United States No Child Left Behind Act Humphrey Bogart Social rule Charter school Boston Public Current teachings of Prem Rawat Education Melanie Wilkes Shaggy dog story Roe v.

how can feminism rid itself of female sex supremacists what is a good checklist to tell a feminist from a female sex supremacist since iam a feminist i wouldnt want to get rid of myself well what we would have to do is make a distinction i personally don't like to think of myself as a feminist despite having a number of feminist ideals because of the female sex supremacists trying to reverse sexism onto men it's a horrible thing they've taken the original problem and are trying to push it from women to men which defeats the whole purpose of the movement if more women got together and tried to make a distinction between crazy psycho supremacy bi atches and actual feminists it would go a long way toward helping the issue but you always get the radicals in a movement and it's generally the radicals that wind up defining it because they're so much more outspoken and controversial it's just keeping checks and balances and making your voice heard  Feminism Gender-neutral language Feminist movement Gender role Masculism Homophobia Civil rights Sexism White separatism White supremacy Sex-positive feminism Domestic violence Pornography Thealogy Neofascism and religion History of women in the United States Radical feminism Woman Ethics Gender Transgender Orgasm History of feminism Same-sex marriage Homosexuality and transgender White nationalism History of intersex surgery God and gender Andrea Dworkin Robin Morgan Racism Abortion debate Sex Transsexuality Gender-specific pronoun Political correctness National Organization for Women Lesbian Anal sex Anti-racism Scientology beliefs and practices American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Sigmund Freud Deconstruction Intersex surgery Black supremacy Prostitution Condom Androgen insensitivity syndrome Queer American Conservatism American Psycho Oz (TV series) Heteronormativity Intelligent design Human sexual behavior Puritan D.

feminist mothers how did your sons turn out after all my daughter's in law reckon they married nice men my son was born and stayed very macho and traditional he's been doing odd jobs since he was a kid and working steadily since he was he got his high school diploma he got married when he was he is still married and has a year old daughter they just bought their first house he's been with the same company for years and is middle management and she's a sahm they're good people who care about things like the environment and animals and other people i believe the impact my feminism or equal mindedness made on him was simply teaching him right from wrong that has to be done from an early age some of the things i can think of are women are people citizens with the same rights and responsibilities when naming famous men i brought up famous women on occasion while letting him admire and have male role models i let him play with both boys and girls and discuss differences without putting them into a separate species i taught him how to defend himself against agressive girls who didn't know right from wrong without crossing a line and becoming abusive i taught him when it was ok and not ok to have sex and what rape was without overwhelming him at too young an age essentially even if a drunk prostitute was running down a dark alley naked yelling rape me there's still no excuse for rape what do you do call when he witnessed things first hand such as the bullying of girls i didn't make excuses or teach him denial we discussed everything he found himself defending girls from school bullies quite a few times when he was little and yes he has had to deal with the type of girl who was abused or something and instigates naughty things and makes false accusations he passed with flying colors because he was never tempted by people like her he knew from an early age what a nice girl was a person with a personality and her own ideas not just a sexy thing whom you know nothing about he's had to deal with all kinds of things that the men on this forum complain about but he wasn't overwhelmed by it because he knows right from wrong he didn't become a wimp or a traitor or very much different than the average successful working class american man the anti feminist traditional religious women i know are jealous of my success with raising my son that he's such a good man and their kids have lots of problems and people who were against me raising him myself because i was a single mother have had to eat their words on many occasions  Abortion debate Theory of conduct Boston Public Domestic violence About a Boy Gender role Prostitution Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Poker jargon Silent Night, Deadly Night Friends Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Same-sex marriage Polygamy Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Great Teacher Onizuka Philosophy of language Saved by the Bell Falsifiability Kodocha The Inside Germaine Greer Knots Landing Trailer Park Boys One Tree Hill (TV series) American Psycho Springfield Elementary School Ethics French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Milton H.

don't you think that insulting women would make them more prone to become feminists it depends on the men and women men become feminists too what affect insulting women will have on them it also depends on how insulting people are being towards them as well i grew up pretty sheltered living in rural areas i could not believe how men treated women away from there college was a rude shock the disrespect of some men towards women was not just upsetting it was dangerous what many got away with when i was in college in the 's but that didn't make women feminists it made for some very messed up women the women and men i knew who became feminists just wanted to be treated with respect and not as a piece of meat on campus after college i've lived primarily in medium sized to large us cities and at work while walking to lunch i've been repeatedly sexually harassed walking down the street in business clothing by men hooting at me on construction sites men in cars screaming at me while they were supposedly driving men saying outrageous things to me while walking down the street past me or on the opposite side of the street in parking lots etc frankly most women and men found this behavior insulting not gratifying and the women often felt it was threatening if they weren't feminists beforehand even shy women and men got tired of being treated so poorly i've had co workers and managers repeatedly tell sexual jokes about women while the women were present at work at the business work site again many women didn't consider themselves feminists beforehand but quickly got sick of being treated like a prostitute at work unfortunately the younger men and women didn't like the behavior but were not willing to stand up to the harassers when these men acted inappropriately at other workplaces i saw more older men and women 's who were only too willing to tell other men what they thought of their sexual harassment and sexism but it's very threatening for many women to stand up to a harasser i agree if you've never been discriminated against or been harassed on a regular basis in public or at work you'll have less reasons to think you need to be a feminist but if you respect yourself and expect others to act professionally at work and treat others civilly in public you're less likely to take it and say boys will be boys or girls will be girls i've also seen a woman sexually harass men and was equally upset but the men didn't want to make waves  Sexual harassment Feminism Prostitution Masculism Sex-positive feminism Gender role Shaggy dog story Domestic violence Woman Social rule Human sexual behavior Internet troll Yoko Ono Camille Paglia Simone Weil Joke St. Elmo's Fire (film) Germaine Greer Sex Effeminacy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sexism Economic inequality Human sexuality Biology and sexual orientation 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Transsexuality Gender-neutral language Civil rights Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an History of intersex surgery Animal rights Orgasm Full Metal Panic?

why is it gender and women's studies wouldn't gender studies suffice is 'female' no longer a gender carrie on the same wikipedia page you quoted that from womens studies are classified as a subset of gender studies http en wikipedia org wiki gender studies women s studies gender studies would certainly suffice the only reason it was called women's studies in the first place is because that's what it's called elsewhere and before this forum was created but someone somewhere along the line realized that without studying all of society that means men as well then there's not a whole lot to study you can't be equal to nothing there must be something to compare it to so if you're going to study both genders you may as well call it what it is instead of having such a misleading and one sided title duh it's only misleading to people who don't already know what it is  Gender identity Sexual orientation Transgender Gender Gender role Woman Gender-neutral language Transsexuality Homophobia Gender gap Cross-dressing Uniform Resource Locator Bisexuality Feminism Sex Patriarchy Neopaganism Affirmative action Sexism Masculism Christian views of women Heteronormativity Economic inequality Drag queen Scalable Vector Graphics Biology and sexual orientation Adjective Gender studies Culture Suffrage Discrimination Domestic violence God and gender Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Same-sex marriage Bulgarian language Family Transfeminism Nudity Twin Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Bah__'__ Faith and gender equality Sex assignment Transvestism A Series of Unfortunate Events Wireless Application Protocol Transwoman Power (sociology) Radical feminism English language Inflection Wiki Man Gender identity disorder Infantilism Hitchhiking Sociolinguistics History of intersex surgery Feminist movement Gay Effeminacy Herpes simplex virus John Money Homosexuality and Christianity Human sexuality Wikipedia Gender differences in spoken Japanese Gay rights Sadism and masochism Human sexual behavior Homestar Runner Wiki Divorce Domain Name System Salic law Esperanto as an international language Homosexuality and transgender LGBT One Power David Gauntlett HTTP cookie Family name Scottish country dance Graphology Susan McClary Grammatical gender Sex and intelligence Queer Japanese honorifics Lisp programming language Gaze Homestar Runner Spanish pronouns Athenian democracy Genderqueer The Handmaid's Tale Women's suffrage Autogynephilia Norwegian language Anime SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs

random question didn't post the first time i asked so if it posts twice i'm sorry i was just reading the answers to one of the questions below me and i read numerous people answering your rack to the question complete with other various sexual references it got me thinking about a million different things for one do guys actually say things like this in real life or do they only say it when they're hiding behind a computer screen especially when they don't even have pictures of themselves posted up do guys attempt to compliment girls like this i can't picture it working also would you ever actually meet someone in person that you started talking to on yahoo answers or even just online in general seems weird to me then again i didnt think people actually used dating websites either but apparently a lot of people do curious to see your thoughts great question i believe the comment was posted about me in an answer and it made me think about the exact same thing comments as such don't warrant a response so i never give it any attention when it goes on in this forum nobody can objectify you unless you feel objectified and i don't so i get my entertainment out of it and keep it moving people become courageous when they can hide behind a computer so no these comments are not as common in a face to face interaction where they usually put their best foot forward to impress you  The Apprentice 2 Social rule Plame affair Theory of conduct Milton H.

why are all women the same ok in my vast dating history i've found that aside from having different interests varied degrees of self confidence different levels of intelligence and different life experiences women are all basically the same in the end more so than men my male friends are very very unique in comparison to one another can't say the same for women though you can even see it in hollywood male vs female celebrities this is why i can't commit to one woman they are like m m's varied on the outside the same on the inside exactly shadow soldier thats exactly what i was doing and you are the only one smart enough to pick up on it haha they're not but you know it is kinda hypocritical and funny at the same time women always say ''men are all the same'' and when you twist it around you have them all whinging  Interracial couple Sex Humphrey Bogart Harem anime Game show Cliff Richard Condom Education in the United States Gender role Samurai Deeper Kyo __eljko Ra__natovi__ Economic inequality Human sexual behavior Social rule Moon Orgasm Chinese language Biology and sexual orientation Roswell UFO incident Electrophysiology Philip J.

why do women become highly successful and then complain that they can't find a good man i don't get why women ignore traditional roles become highly powerful independent educated and finanically successful and then complain that they can't find a good man or a man up to that standard because men are intimidated by successful women or they don't messure up to the same level of success just because women have started outshining men that doesn't change the fact that most men want a women who is below them in one way or another this is something that will never change men are not going to change what they like just because women no longer want to be in the roles men have always found attractive men are not intimidated by powerful or successful women just turned off and not interested no decent man wants to be with an alpha woman don't believe me how many men are pounding down the door to date oprah then ask who whats to date eva logoria you women know what your getting into every step of the way so why act surprised when men look the other way actually real men are turned on by successful powerful independent women lol like you would have any clue what being a 'real man' is as a woman it is impossible for you to know what being a 'real man' is therefore you cannot judge when someone is a 'real man' is or not what a glaring logical fallacy sure these women have a great resume to impress the corporate world and perhaps herself but honestly what normal hard working devoted man would want such a narrowly ambitious woman as a wife given this it broaches the question of what type of mother she would actually be one who challenges men on their traditional grounds and who despises her traditional role while mimicking male accomplishments but anyway for the record men don't give a sh t about a woman's career or financial status women seem to delude themselves into thinking that men size women up on the same basis they size us men up on by the time these career women become successful educated and highly powerful they're most likely in their 's w their looks fading and their biological clock ticking down why would a man want to start a family w a woman of that age men prefer younger women it's a biological trait men are predisposed to healthy fertile women such women are indicative of producing healthy offspring which is why in a real world application you won't see many men starting a family w a woman in her s etc further having children w women whose ovaries are running out at that age has an increased risk of birth defects another reason why men avoid such women or any woman irrespective of her career status for that matter also combine this with the fact that 'career' women raise their standards too high they like most women choose to 'marry up' thing is given their degree of success it will be much much more difficult to find the right man that suits their criteria on a side note studies have shown that successful women who do actually 'marry down' eventually become discontent w the marriage and thus they initiate the divorce primary reason being that they prefer a man of higher status than them they prefer him to be the breadwinner seemingly finally men choose to avoid these career women b c they would much rather prefer a young woman to have their kids and take care of them in other words they want a wife who has traditional values they don't want some career driven women who would most likely stick their kids in a daycare centre having them raised by some strangers and who also places her career above you understand this your career is irrelevant all these excuses these insecure women have are rubbish men are 'intimidated' by 'strong independant and successful' women etc the real reason is b c men are turned off by you hence why they avoid you b tches end  Divorce Abortion debate Biology and sexual orientation Infantilism Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cancer Theory of conduct Emperor of Japan Economic inequality Polyamory Atheism Intelligent design Microeconomics Puberty Homosexuality and transgender Fathers' rights Same-sex marriage in Canada Tai Chi Chuan Human height Friends Intelligence quotient Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Same-sex marriage Gender-neutral language Sexual orientation Logic Rape Education in Japan Domestic violence Appeal Species Adoption Democracy Single Transferable Vote Physical attractiveness Asperger syndrome Marriage Transsexuality Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Gender role Family Obesity Intersexuality Psoriasis Incest The Smoking Room Married... with Children Arguments for and against drug prohibition Mathematics Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Sexual abstinence Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Theodicy Extreme Programming Goodness and value theory Paradox EastEnders Religion and sexuality Woman History of British nationality law Redundant array of independent disks Tocopherol Fight Club Annuity W.

why are most of the questions in this section attacks on women misogynists or anti feminists are constantly complaining about man haters on this forum but the majority of hateful questions answers are coming from them really why do you feel the need to do that why can't we just have a discussion seriously is anyone capable of answering this question honestly and logically i am not saying that no feminist has ever attacked a man on this forum or anywhere else i realize nobody's perfect and that everybody is mean sometimes ok i am talking about the discussion here at y a gender women's studies section not about how people treat other people in real life most of the so called misogynists here are actually young boys who confuse mating issues with feminism feminism is about democracy and equal rights not courtship rituals young boys who are in their pre sexual explorations of male female relationships which includes confrontational behaviors frequently experience frustration in learning effective courtship rituals and then out of immaturity and or ignorance they label their misadventures and social failures with girls and women under the catch all name of feminism as i wrote earlier today i may date a black man and bicker with him about how he doesn't listen to me as an example but because we might bicker in our courtship behaviors i would not deviate the issue to wishing a return to slavery boys who fail in mating courtship relationships though oftentimes wish a return to second class citizenship for women in retaliation  Feminism Civil rights Courtship Human sexual behavior Gender role Homophobia Transgender Masculism Sexual orientation Feminist movement Domestic violence Homosexuality Same-sex marriage Homosexuality and Christianity Philosophy of language Infantilism Internet troll God and gender Andrea Dworkin Incest Sexual attraction Sigmund Freud Sex History of intersex surgery Heteronormativity Gender identity Abortion debate Zoophilia Gender-neutral language Economic inequality History of sex Bisexuality Girl God Emperor of Dune Motivation Age of consent Narcissism Misogyny Susan McClary Aesthetic Realism Sex-positive feminism Religion and sexuality The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Homosexuality and transgender Biology and sexual orientation Germaine Greer Democracy Mary Wollstonecraft Woman The Handmaid's Tale Generation X Reparative therapy Polygamy Psychology Rape Calvin and Hobbes Asian fetish Radical feminism Pedophilia Female genital cutting Feminists for Life Adolescence Friendship SAT Androgen insensitivity syndrome Animal rights Power (sociology) Goodness and value theory LaVeyan Satanism Sadism and masochism Cross-dressing Child sexual abuse Simone Weil Mojave people Political correctness Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Child sexuality Scientology beliefs and practices Anne Boleyn Ruth Bader Ginsburg Atheism Mary Jane Watson Eric Cartman Karen Horney Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Asperger syndrome Grimke Sisters African American literature Affirmative action Culture Demographics of sexual orientation

if a misandrist can be a feminist why can't a misogynist be one too please read this before answering there seems to be quite a few misandrists within the feminist movement whether it is in real life or on the internet such as y a but whatever the case those misandrist feminists are almost always defended by fellow feminists and sometimes even admired by them now feminist isn't female exclusive a man can be just as much a feminist as a woman since a feminist is according to dictionary com someone who advocates gender equality so since both men and women can be feminists and misandrists are supported by other feminists why can't a misogynist also be a feminist i am asking this since a ''supposed'' misogynist is calling himself a feminist but feminists are denying his label if you deny misandrists are supported by other feminists please do not answer the question as you are still in denial thank you ''seduction is often difficult to distinguish from rape in seduction the rapist often bothers to buy a bottle of wine '' andrea dworkin no matter what context you put this in it won't matter she believes sex is rape feel free to put it in a context where it will be alright here put this in context too ''only when manhood is dead and it will perish when ravaged femininity no longer sustains it only then will we know what it is to be free '' thanks good point absolutely no reason there are plenty of misandrist feminists and they justify it somehow so there's definitely no reason a misogynist can't be one as well  Feminism Andrea Dworkin Civil rights Feminist movement Misogyny Abortion debate Masculism Gender Gender-neutral language Gender role History of feminism Woman Susan McClary Misandry Fathers' rights Domestic violence Theory of conduct Homosexuality and transgender God and gender Anarchism Theodicy Human sexual behavior Women in Islam American individualist anarchism National Organization for Women Pornography Catharine MacKinnon Bernard Williams Philosophy of language Radical feminism Gender identity Deconstruction Same-sex marriage Suffrage Two Treatises of Government Same-sex marriage in Canada Prostitution Sexual orientation Ronald Dworkin Serial killer Ethics Second-wave feminism Bisexuality Penis envy Transgender Postmodernism History of women in the United States Feminists for Life Holocaust denial Biblical inerrancy Atheism Homophobia Goodness and value theory Transfeminism Sexism Artemisia Gentileschi Legal aspects of transsexualism The Handmaid's Tale History of intersex surgery Roman Catholic Church Pedophilia Bell hooks Islam as a political movement Ruth Bader Ginsburg Infantilism Asian fetish Grimke Sisters Religion Sola fide Comfort women Friedrich Nietzsche Merit Arthur Schopenhauer Left-Right politics Spanish pronouns Butch and femme Homosexuality Epistemology Female genital cutting Feminist theology Social rule Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Discrimination Resurrection of Jesus Orgasm Age of consent Patriarchy Non-aggression principle Objectivist philosophy Thealogy Animal rights Church of Christ Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Free will Germaine Greer

why do women like to throw around the idea that men are intimidated by certain types of women i hear it all the time men are intimidated by strong women men are intimidated by attractive women men are intimidated by independent women etc etc etc honestly why do women like to throw this around if i walk around with a gun drawn i can brag that yeah people are intimidated by me because i have a gun so what does that make me does that make me special or important or interesting nope my whole point here is so what if you intimidate men it doesn't mean anything in the grand scheme of things many of these women who have to constantly berate the point that they are too strong too attractive too successful and too educated that men are intimidated it's no coincidence that many of these women are without a man and are single and lonely and yes surveys have shown that these so called proffessional women have a harder time having a man or keeping a man than women who simply don't feel the need to try to outdo their men how often do these very same women exercise introspection and realize that perhaps men aren't intimidated by their alleged traits and perhaps these men may simply be turned off by an overbearing arrogant domineering and demonstrative woman as one responder said many of these women who have to continuously berate this point are not strong women but are actually weak women any woman that has to constantly tell a man she's strong is an insecure weak woman that is unsure of herself my woman is a strong woman i make more money than her and have a higher education than her but that doesn't make me stronger unlike the so called strong women i don't feel the need to chastize her and rub in her face that i make more money and i attend a prestigous university she's content and secure with her self is extremely responsible intelligent and has a great deal of prowess and it shows through her actions not her words therefore she is strong  Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Domestic violence Poker jargon Humphrey Bogart Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City David Hume Jiddu Krishnamurti Atheism Blackjack Dead Like Me The nature of God in Western theology Simone Weil Blonde on Blonde Columbine High School massacre Karen Horney God Emperor of Dune Aerial (dance move) Guns N' Roses Asperger syndrome Undergrads Jam (TV series) Rape Public-key cryptography Sharon Tate Katelyn Faber The Smoking Room Kim Possible Hiberno-English Professional wrestling slang Calvin and Hobbes Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Noam Chomsky Emotions (album) Effeminacy Eye contact Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Tonality Dragon Booster Strap-on dildo Empress L__ Zhi American football strategy Plame affair Knots Landing The O.C.

is america brainwashed by feminism i think this from ask men com as most men know women generally have an advantage in relationships especially in this era where men have been brainwashed by feminism into believing that any show of assertiveness on their part equals injury to the woman ironically even though many feminists complain about assertive men they often choose assertive men as their lovers this kind of female hypocrisy is rampant in many areas for example women will say that men are cheaters even though women are cheating in record numbers if caught cheating they will say that men do it too they will complain that men have double standards about promiscuity when in fact they themselves hold that double standard they view promiscuous men as threats to their relationships yet are attracted to a man who can bed large numbers of women since it implies that he must be doing something pretty special to get all those partners i was wondering if you could write a column describing the phenomenon of attention shifting by females in order to help men who are being manipulated by it i gather from your question that you don't believe in equality which is what feminism advocates feminism is a diverse collection of social theories political movements and moral philosophies largely motivated by or concerning the experiences of women especially in terms of their social political and economic situation as a social movement feminism largely focuses on limiting or eradicating gender inequality and promoting women's rights interests and issues in society some feminists take a holistic approach to politics believing the saying of martin luther king jr a threat to justice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere in that belief some self identified feminists support other movements such as the civil rights movement and the gay rights movement at the same time many black feminists such as bell hooks criticize the movement for being dominated by white women feminist claims about the alleged disadvantages women face in western society are often less relevant to the lives of black women this idea is the key in postcolonial feminism many black feminist women prefer the term womanism for their views  Feminist movement Civil rights Postmodernism Gender role Affirmative action Masculism Ethics Libertarianism Liberalism Domestic violence Conservatism Sexual orientation Fathers' rights Social justice Same-sex marriage Left-wing politics Islam as a political movement Objectivist philosophy Nonviolence Goodness and value theory History of women in the United States Deconstruction Cultural relativism Transsexuality Animal rights American Conservatism Democracy Liberal movements within Islam Coercion Political views of Lyndon LaRouche Homosexuality Mind control Religion Anarcho-primitivism Human sexual behavior Asian fetish Abortion debate New Testament Causality Philosophy of mathematics Communitarianism State Gender-neutral language Economic inequality Brainwashing Capitalism Liberal Christianity Political philosophy Social democracy Pedophilia American liberalism Political correctness Marriage Philosophy of language Bisexuality Multiculturalism Globalization Anarcho-capitalism Intelligent design Altruism Human nature Philosophy of science Reparative therapy Racism Louis Althusser Human rights Roe v.

do you think we have to begin to think more globaly in terms of questions answers what i mean about this is that it seems that answerers come from very different backgrounds and cultures of course this creates friction would it be helpful to have a little bit more information about the background of each of us perhaps we would become more human here if i say this is because a friend of mine died today it makes me think all of us can go away in a second and we are wasting so much time with hate perhaps if we know a little bit of each other is easier to have tolerance before this question gets deleted again i want to be clear that this topic is oriented towards trying to understand the hatred from bothe genders in this place i'm not sure that i agree with your inference of friction attributed to the convergence of diverse cultural backgrounds in yahoo answers offering more information on individuals answering questions has no bearing on the answer when in fact the objective is to answer the question regardless of any cultural background i don't see much time devoted to hate in yahoo answers and truthfully there are more answers that might be satirical in nature and border on sarcasm but the highest percentage of answers are those that come from serious people trying to help others who for whatever reason have a need if you are referring entirely on gender issues it is quite evident that we live in a world that has seen the highest levels of divorce and family breakup it would be understandable that some women and some men have veered towards disdain for the opposite sex instead of learning from their bad experiences and focusing on more positive thoughts without stereotyping a total gender based on their own maligned images yahoo answers has at times become a battle ground for political religious cultural and sexual issues but we have to keep in mind that in a forum such as this the right to free speech and free expression is what makes it all work people can feel free to say whatever they want within the parameters of yahoo answers conduct policies without the fear of retribution by others within the forum giving out cultural information might lead to further hateful and harassing statements does the death of your friend have any relevance to your statements  Sexual orientation Homophobia Reparative therapy Homosexuality and Christianity Hate speech Gender identity Philosophy of language Gender role Transsexuality Feminism Ethics Freedom of speech Socrates Zoophilia Same-sex marriage Expert system David Hume Theory of conduct Meaning of life A Course In Miracles Globalization Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Sex Human The nature of God in Western theology Internet troll Bisexuality Gay rights Logic Social psychology Political correctness Domestic violence Gender-neutral language Masculism Cultural relativism Reality Opposition to cults and new religious movements Democracy Civil rights Infantilism Ex-gay Past teachings of Prem Rawat Cult Transgender Bayesian inference Polyamory Economic inequality Scientology beliefs and practices Homosexuality and transgender Religion The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Religion and sexuality Goodness and value theory Philosophy Human sexuality English grammar Franz Boas Abortion debate Philosophy of mathematics God Second language acquisition William A.

which according to you is better being born as a man or a woman do cite the reason for your reply looking for some serious answers plzzzz i would say being born a man is probably more naturally fortuitous in most countries you won't be killed at birth or before just because of your sex you will be allowed to go to school you won't be treated as a second class citizen and you will be afforded all of the rights of the judicial system of your country you will be allowed to vote you won't have to hide your face behind clothing just because of who you are you won't be killed by your father because you are raped and bring dishonor upon your family you will always feel loved wanted and cherished by your father he will be proud of you just because you are his son and you were born the right sex this is why i think it is better to be born a man in most countries in this world granted this is not true of everywhere but the cultural beliefs can be found anywhere  Same-sex marriage Transsexuality Honor killing Civil rights Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Feminism Human sexual behavior Adoption Israeli Arab Abortion debate Women in Islam Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Arjuna Abortion Romulus and Remus Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sexual orientation Homosexuality and Christianity The Brothers Karamazov Same-sex marriage in Canada French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Simone Weil Theory of conduct Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Divorce Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Legal aspects of transsexualism Phaedo Feminist movement Freedom of speech Equal Protection Clause Birth control Same-sex marriage in the United States Fathers' rights Masculism Katelyn Faber Sexual intercourse Discrimination Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Abortion in the United States British nationality law Democracy Homosexuality and transgender History of sex Theodicy Federal Marriage Amendment Roman Kingdom Gender role About a Boy Charles Grandison Finney One Tree Hill (TV series) Strap-on dildo Sharia Women's suffrage Polygamy Democratic Party (United States) Roe v.

why do women like to ask men for favors and not expect to give anything back a lot of women wont hesistate to ask a guy for a favor even if they have only known the guy for a short time or met him once or twice but then when a guy asks a woman for a favor suddenly she forgets how to speak properly like well umm duh get i are busy and me think the oven is on to give an example i was close friends with this girl and did her many favors and she told several times if you ever need anything just ask then when i finally ask for a favor not even a big one she was like duuuhh i don't know but i'm not just talking about this situation i mean in general women seem to have an attitude that men owe them something i asked to borrow a cd this is after jump starting her car setting up her computer helping her move and helping her get an internship well actually i asked her to make me a copy but she said no so i asked to borrow it i agree when you say that women in general in america think men owe them something i remember standing in line at a mini mart at a gas station i was in line and one guy was in front of me this woman behind me slyly tries to sneak up to the front and tries to nudge her way to the front i guess she thinks she's too good to wait in line behind men but what angered me a bit was that the guy in front of me decided to be a punk and act p ussy whooped and let her in front like he was being chivalrous to a woman trying to cut she didn't even say thank you she just felt entitled i'm all for letting someone in front of me the other day i got in line and let a woman in front of me because i realized she had been in line and she just had to get some other things but if a woman tries to slyly sneak to the front sorry i'm going to tell her politely that i was in line before her there's no rule that says women are allowed to cut in front of men still many hard line feminists will ridicule me for having this standpoint mike t after further analysis i think you should really tell this woman all that you've told yahoo answers she may be unaware of her inconsideration of selfishness many women are she may get angry or she may receive it well and apologize for her actions and make ammends along with letting you copy the cd women always say men should communicate better right well you're not doing much to improve the situation by telling us tell her what's the worse that can happen if she gets angry well you already were going to disassociate with her for her actions correct if she takes it well and uses it to overhaul her attitude then you can be friends with her again good luck i disagree with seven when she says men shouldn't ask favors from women such as borrowing a cd just because a woman gave birth to him yeah but it takes a man to fertilize the seed maybe women shouldn't ask men for favors then too nonsense last i checked the woman mike t asked a favor from isn't his mother she didn't give birth to him biological traits should be irrelevant when concerning whether or not someone can do a small favor as a friend companion associate  Friends Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha Avenue Q She Loves You Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Little Britain Milton H.

do you believe these findings are correct in marilyn french's seminal works analyzing patriarchy and its effects on the world at large including women men and children she defines patriarchy as a system that values power over life control over pleasure and dominance over happiness how can we alter these beliefs to work towards a more equitable society for marginalized groups i think that if we deconstruct the notions that surround control dominance and power we may be on our way i feel that it ties in quite closely with what is expected of men based upon their gender there is a great deal of work on the gender expectations of women but i don't see a great deal on gender expectation of men most of the work i have seen is cursory at best i think that if we could somehow shift that paradigm that men have to act a certain way in the way that we have shifted the paradigm that women must only be wives and mothers than we will be able to move towards a more positive and inclusive society by the way does anyone else find it terribly amusing that the first two supremely negative answers did nothing but strengthen the argument being made in the initial question i lol'd  Feminism Patriarchy Social psychology Gender role Sexual orientation Power (sociology) Anarcho-primitivism Postmodernism Economic inequality Ethics Heteronormativity Feminist movement Coercion Matriarchy Goodness and value theory Transsexuality Divorce Radical feminism Same-sex marriage Deconstruction Gender-neutral language Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Abortion debate Social justice God Morphology (linguistics) Microeconomics Goddess Human sexual behavior Paradigm Liberalism Marriage Anarchism Affirmative action Paradigm shift Sociology Jacob Neusner Economics Structuralism Transgender Utilitarianism Incest Bertrand Russell Infantilism Domestic violence Human Homophobia Afrocentrism Effeminacy Homosexuality and transgender Object-oriented programming Fathers' rights Estoppel Sexism Objectivist philosophy Same-sex marriage in Canada State Birth control Twelve leverage points Social research History of intersex surgery Supernatural Gender identity Intelligent design Simone Weil Lesbian Human rights Reparative therapy Motivation Philosophy of space and time Second language acquisition LGBT Libertarian socialism Gentrification Anarchist economics Gay Political economy Democratic Party (United States) Drug abuse Civil rights Property (ownership right) Critical theory Sadism and masochism Susan McClary English grammar Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Immanuel Kant Expert system Sex War Japanese values Science G__del's incompleteness theorem Homosexuality and Christianity Mary Wollstonecraft Democracy Ruth Bader Ginsburg Paternalism

iamgine a woman hooks up with a steady man with an normal to decent income the man had a vasectomy but doesnt inform her about it in an attempt to get pregnant she forgets the pill since she is not getting pregnant she bangs some thug who is barely getting by financially when she comes back pregnant to the well off guy for marriage or child support he can proove the child is not his since his sperm count is zero a surprise to the soon to be mother should the guy have to pay child support anyway since he tricked her and because it is in the best interest of the child to go after the money of the well off guy since there is nothing to take from the biological father i think many here would be surprised to learn that many men have been in similar circumstances where they were ordered to pay child support for children to which they are unrelated it is an all too common problem estimates put the percentage of this at between and many states still hold to the legislation that says all children born into the marriage are considered children of the husband depending on the state he has a very narrow window in which to contest paternity this means if she can hide it long enough she's free and clear and will never be prosecuted for fraud even when she knows the husband is not the father not only should the husband in your question not have to pay she should be heavily fined and jailed for fraud and attempted extortion as well as receive nothing in the divorce if the husband chooses to go that route the bio dad should receive total shared custody with the mother  Divorce EastEnders Child support Child custody Knots Landing Marriage Advance fee fraud Birth control 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Abortion debate Paternity Father Fathers' rights Fathers' rights movement in the UK Past characters (Neighbours) Neighbours Masculism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Enron Corporation One Tree Hill (TV series) Isabella of Jerusalem Family Single parent Credit card Pregnancy Friends Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Fred Phelps Internet fraud Babylonian law Fertility awareness David Blunkett Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom IBM PC compatible Woman Hillary Rodham Clinton Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Contract Married... with Children Family name Prostate cancer Algerian Family Code The Marriage of Figaro Mail-order bride Legal rights of women Evan Mecham Indira Gandhi Politics of Canada Freeters Alois Hitler Human Marc Dutroux Domestic violence Melanie Wilkes Tax British nationality law Federal Marriage Amendment Paternalism Witch trial Confidence trick Spyware FairTax Will & Grace Brian Griffin Bank fraud Sun Myung Moon Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Incarnations of Immortality Diana, Princess of Wales Women in Islam Social Security (United States) Peter Griffin Capitalism Martha Stewart Same-sex marriage Lawrence v.

are men becoming more and more submissive in the modern world in my opinion its not about submission or non submission there are women who believe that we should rule the world and there are those who feel that we are entitled to the same rights as men and gender equality in most societies boys are taught that men have the dominant role in relationships families society in general since modern day women have more rights this conflicts with that mode of thinking because women now choose and decide for themselves which strips away from the dominance of men and places them in an equal position sex is also a factor of why some men feel submissive most women choose who they will sleep with therefore some men feel they have to go to certain measures to have intercourse with them translating it then to women having some sort of power in contrast a woman doesn't really need to do much convincing to have a man sleep with her unless she is hideous looking or for some other rare reason personally i don't want for women to show preponderance over men its obvious that men with no character can become dull after a while no offense to anyone personally but most definitely do not agree with male dominance either because women are not inferior in any way shape or form unless they choose to be balance is all it takes though its easier said than done there are many other reasons for these issues between men and women but i focused on those however in midst of all this i do find that male submission or dominance does work where sex concerns because its mutual and consentual fun  Sexual orientation Infantilism Homosexuality and Christianity Human sexual behavior Transgender Homophobia Feminism Domination & submission (BDSM) Gender role Domestic violence BDSM Gender Homosexuality Economic inequality Women in Islam Transsexuality French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Gender-neutral language Human sexuality Androgen insensitivity syndrome Same-sex marriage Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Group sex Cross-dressing Divorce Age of consent Same-sex marriage in Canada Woman Child sexual abuse Theory of conduct Sex Friedrich Schleiermacher God and gender The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Lawrence v.

what do these kind of questions have to do with gender and women s studies google is a great tool if we don t know what something means it easy to search i just go to the categories where i want to read to learn something new or where i can answer because it is an area that i know why this section has little to do with the academic subject yes there is free speech but hey this is just too exaggerated guys would u rather be naked unable to talk stranded on the planet of the apes or be married to allegra should neurotic single women with yappy dogs they cant controll be destroyed by lethal injection why do women whom go to jail always turn out sleeping with a woman i mean they cant hold off for a man do the women around here make better men then the men do can the great alpha feminists please teach us what is a back passage if feminists don't want kids why don't they just get tubal litigation and shut up etc in the last four pages of the questions are like this i don t even open these questions but still i have to read the title unless i close my eyes on the other hand good questions or funny questions get deleted enlighten me please ok there is a lot of hate for women ok express your hate but could people post sometimes something more interesting or is it impossible i know there are people that post interesting questions but each day they are fewer and fewer as people leave because there is no real debate here and i know i will get insulted i don't care fraxinus yes it seems i need good long vacations from here too fresh air and positive vives gosh i sound so new age lol happy bullet what about us women that are interest in human rights and not in talks about cosmetics dresses or relationship gossips there are men also that are not interested in talking about cars but other social issues i am interested in gender and women's studies it is not my degree but it interests me i believe in human rights men and women but not in denigrating either sex perhaps that is why i don't shut up when i feel there are too many offensive questions and before you say it trolls like la rose that attacks men also infuriate me it is just that those questions are posted more seldom in comparison i was thinking the other day that after have been here for a couple of months i am more feminist than before because of all the attacking questions answers i am sure i am not the only one ironic isn't it the majority of stupid questions in gender and women's studies look like the work of immature stupid individuals on the other hand the sick crazy questions look like the work of sociopaths and psychopaths i totally disagree with the suggestion that stupid and or sick hateful people will go away if ignored you're underestimating the sickness and hatred of these people abusive questioners and answerers are relentless like any ruthless bullies and won't be stopped until they are relentlessly pursued and permanently banished if you look at the history of feminist anti racist anti homophobic and political progressive web sites discussion boards and blogs the organizers have been forced to take extreme measures to ensure the safety of people who wanted to participate without being barraged by psychotic messages and abused by the mentally unstable that love to flourish in an anonymous public domain yahoo users will never get rid of these people by using simplistic methods of just ignore them they'll go away these sick people will not go away unless ruthlessly tracked and banned by the yahoo organizers like the sick people here who relentlessly pursue users who dare to stand up to them yahoo answers will only stay the same with varying levels of hatred and abuse depending on the energy level of the sociopaths yahoo users can do absolutely nothing to change this situation yahoo has allowed the crazies to take over large portions of answers my time is going to be more and more limited so i'm going to participate in a monitored feminist web site where i can have intelligent conversations with varying degrees of disagreement without having to listen to a barrage of hate directed at women people of color glba's or anyone else who gets in these sick people's path  Internet troll Homophobia Human sexual behavior Theory of conduct Feminism Social rule Domestic violence Philosophy of language Same-sex marriage Abortion debate Shaggy

for women empowerment following which one is trouble men socitey i'm with tera for the most part but in my opinion neither its us women and the way we aim towards women empowerment if that is even the correct term we have to be smarter about how we achieve gender equality not rash and impulsive with male bashing rants yelling women empowerment at the top of our lungs as if we were strategizing some sort of gender coup d'etat perhaps if more women became involved in politics and leadership roles would gain the trust of men in power and they themselves reach those positions then these very women would open the doors for gender equality not empowerment of one gender over the other that will not solve the problems in society  Affirmative action Transgender Masculism Patriarchy Gender role Feminism Transsexuality Woman Sexual orientation Domestic violence Cross-dressing Gender Gender identity Homosexuality and transgender Consensus decision-making Heteronormativity Coup d'__tat The Handmaid's Tale Bah__'__ Faith and gender equality American liberalism African American literature Feminist movement Bisexuality Gender-neutral language Democracy Homophobia Sex John Money Fathers' rights Homosexuality and Christianity Discrimination Same-sex marriage Transvestism Economic inequality Man Radical feminism Congress of the United States God and gender Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sociolinguistics Effeminacy United States House of Representatives Strategic planning Education in Japan Infantilism Biology and sexual orientation Christian views of women Political correctness Drag queen Ba'ath Party Two-Spirit Sexism Womyn Leadership Genderqueer Independence Party (Iceland) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Soviet Union Nudity Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Bulgarian language Orgasm Andrea Dworkin Apothecary Politics of Russia Civil rights United States Senate Homosexuality Assassination Gender differences in spoken Japanese Order of succession Gender gap George Costanza History of intersex surgery Sexual intercourse Equal Rights Amendment Gay rights Sub-Zero Holy Orders Externality Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Changeroom Greek military junta of 1967-1974 Finnish Civil War American Civil Rights Movement (1896-1954) Legal aspects of transsexualism Queer Stoicism Gaze History of the United States (1865-1918) MoveOn French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Separation of powers Dianic Wicca One Power History of feminism Gender studies Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India

should neurotic single women with yappy dogs they cant controll be destroyed by lethal injection so the rest of us can get some peace and quiet and not have to close all our windows i'm not advocating lethal injections for the dogs by the way its the women who fail to controll them i know you will question the narrow focus and say that lots of people other than single women need to be included but single women seem to be far worse in this respect to me and currently out of my nearest neighbours are like this as a single woman without a dog i give you permission to cull they're ruining it for the rest of us  Lethal injection Fuel injection Abortion debate Capital punishment Theory of conduct Animal testing Winter War Karen Horney Insulin X Window System Inuit Eastern Question Anthrax Havanese Mushing Plutonium Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Appeal Equilibrium (2002 film) Hypnosis Suicide Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Continuation War Diabetic retinopathy Martial art Hanging Media in Hong Kong Electrophysiology Jack Kevorkian Animal rights Prisoner (TV series) Fox hunting Aileen Wuornos Sin City Working dog Limp Bizkit Democratic Party (United States) Digital rights management Proposals for a Palestinian state Japanese tea ceremony Diesel engine Saruman Dog training The Apprentice 2 Diazepam Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Radio Yerevan Cyprus dispute For Better or For Worse Iditarod Fred A.

do you think its sexist that men can go topless but women cant lol b dorian i like your style my sentiments exactly just curious where do u live where women can go topless benjamin h valid point just me asking a question is immature i was asking for others opinions grow up you little brat yes because it's an example of women being expected to adjust their lives according to men's preferences breasts are seen as obscene or sexual because men are attracted to them but that's certainly not their breasts' primary purpose and there is nothing unhygenic about going topless but men have redefined them to be shameful sexual objects unless of course they're being put on display for sexual reasons in which case it's just fine and dandy with men if men have a problem with a pair of breasts being used for something other than giving them a hard on quite frankly that's not women's problem and there is no reason why we should have to cater to this idea also where i live going topless is actually legal and women still don't do it imagine all the stares you'd get shudders but why shouldn't women at least have that option  Breast Nudity Sexual orientation Sexual revolution Pornography Transsexuality Feminism Pedophilia Child pornography Gay Zoophilia Gender-neutral language Domestic violence Sexual attraction Theory of conduct 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Social rule Nudism Gender role Abortion Same-sex marriage Narcissism Androgen insensitivity syndrome Undergarment Child sexual abuse Video game controversy Human sexual behavior Biology and sexual orientation Political correctness Prostate cancer Incest Homophobia The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Shaggy dog story Originalism Brassiere Roe v.

why do all women claim to know what it's like to be rayped or give birth despite not having experienced it seems any time someone asks a question about rape on here women will answer talking about how horrible it is and how it feels really horrifying even if they haven't been raped at other times women will spontaneously start going on about how wonderful and strong women feel when they give birth even if they never have ironically they will often go on to say that if you haven't actually experienced it you can never understand what it's like and not understand the hypocrisy of that all women do notclaim to know what its like to be raped or to give birth despite not having experienced either however it is possible that the women you describe are being empathetic perhaps basing their claims on what they have witnessed read or heard about or how they would feel if it were true in their case also many individuals male and female can feel how other individuals feel in some way which is why people cry or cringe or get weak in the knees as reactions to what happens to other people  Theory of conduct Abortion Gender identity Abduction Phenomenon Cross-dressing Abortion debate Transsexuality Empathy Little Britain Sexual orientation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Rape Asperger syndrome Supernatural Milton H.

most of the questions on this page are flamers what is your theory on why feminism attracts this seems obvious to me but i'm honestly curious to know what other people particularly feminists and normal women think is the reason feminism attracts this much negative attention blorange the orange actually i found your opinion to be quite interesting it's not what i think but nevertheless thanks for sharing nikipetis bad answer based on what you just said feminism is about equality the flamers know more about feminism than you do this incorrect theory has now been covered donna that was hysterical and you didn't even answer the question at any rate we know it's wrong because there are not men flaming the women to this extent in other female sections such as beauty and cosmetics justagrandma you needed to go in a different direction fairly early on it that theory according to you men are afraid of women because they bleed during periods which men hardly see and women are responsible for reproduction interesting i thought reproduction took a man and a woman apparently not according to your theory it isnt femnism who attracts this negative attention but the female sex supremacists who have highjacked the feminist movement successfully fighting for perks women got over men i can imagine if you are in a divorce situation and your soon to be ex uses a combination of vawa and restraining order on you to gain an advantage in divorce court you might get angry over it  Feminism Internet troll Feminist movement Civil rights Biology and sexual orientation Gender role Fathers' rights History of intersex surgery Domestic violence The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Abortion debate Woman Ethics Divorce Masculism Lesbian Sex-positive feminism Theory of conduct Orgasm Plame affair Anarchism Women in Islam Transgender Second language acquisition Transfeminism Sexual orientation Homophobia History of women in the United States Equal Protection Clause History of feminism Halakha Kasparov versus The World Religion and sexuality Power (sociology) Transsexuality Same-sex marriage in Canada Ideology Intersex surgery EastEnders Androgen insensitivity syndrome Philosophy of language Radical feminism Same-sex marriage Neuro-linguistic programming Friends Political correctness Deconstruction Strap-on dildo Socrates Human sexual behavior Infantilism Asperger syndrome Homosexuality and transgender Social justice Gender Pedophilia Social rule Liberalism Patriotism American individualist anarchism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Utilitarianism Polygamy Andrea Dworkin Sexual revolution Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Goodness and value theory Autism Heteronormativity Restoration comedy Germaine Greer Gender-neutral language Equal Rights Amendment FairTax Francis Crick Sex in science fiction Fair use Moral Politics Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Animal rights Serial killer Roe v.

nancy friday and the glamourisation of rape part a here is the story that i had discussed in parts as you haven't read it it is a real rape case and cecilia enjoyed getting raped and continues to fantasise over her ordeal same question as before if women are turned on by this story and mastbte over it they too are supporting the crime and rapists would feel vindicated pls read the story below contd in subsequent parts cecilia i can't tell you just how comforting and reassuring it was for me to read your book i had for the past three years harboured a secret guilt because i found so much pleasure in reliving in my fantasies the extremely satisfying pleasure i experienced when i was abducted in a shopping center parking lot by three men taken to an extremely secluded house in the suburbs and raped it was more than just rape really it was sexual enslavement for about eleven hours and it is that the enslavement the subjugation part b i found so thrilling then and which i not only fantasize now but thanks to the understanding and indulgence of my wonderful husband have turned into a way of life perhaps you can understand the sense of guilt i have been suppressing until i read my secret garden because i enjoy his domination over me and my regard for him as my lord and master my girl friends most of them more into women's liberation than i ever could be laugh when i use that phrase and feel i'm making a little joke when i use it but i'm much more sincere about it than they could ever realize first of all let me say that i had been rather inhibited in my sex life prior to that night i was abducted but i wasn't a virgin my fantasies even then centered around the slave girl theme i have always read novels and seen movies in which the beautiful heroine is bought at a slave auction by the handsome ro man commander or the ancient egyptian prince or something like that but always kept them part b i found so thrilling then and which i not only fantasize now but thanks to the understanding and indulgence of my wonderful husband have turned into a way of life perhaps you can understand the sense of guilt i have been suppressing until i read my secret garden because i enjoy his domination over me and my regard for him as my lord and master my girl friends most of them more into women's liberation than i ever could be laugh when i use that phrase and feel i'm making a little joke when i use it but i'm much more sincere about it than they could ever realize first of all let me say that i had been rather inhibited in my sex life prior to that night i was abducted but i wasn't a virgin my fantasies even then centered around the slave girl theme i have always read novels and seen movies in which the beautiful heroine is bought at a slave auction by the handsome ro man commander or the ancient egyptian prince or something like that but always kept them part c more or less in check when i fantasized myself in the situation although i did use them when i masturbated but that night opened a whole new world for me sexually and eliminated virtually every inhibition you can dream of parts of that night still remain a blur to me i was so frightened for a large part of it especially the early part when i didn't know exactly what was happening and was beaten though not too hard until i agreed to submit and be obedient and toward the end when i wasn't certain that they would ever let me go but in between i slipped into my fantasy and actually became that slave girl i had fantasized about i lived the role it was as though i had been transported back across the ages to ancient rome or from reality into a novel or movie it is this that i recall vividly now in incredible detail four or five of the things that happened to me especially which thrill me just to think of them now and which i fantasize about constantly and which my part d husband duplicates as well as possible but without the terrifying brutality of that night i was twenty three and single i had my own apartment and was working as a receptionist in a law office and was doing some fashion modeling part time in the evenings when i could they took me as i was getting back into my car after buying groceries at a supermarket they just shoved me into my car onto the floor in the rear and drove off with me there were three of them one was about twenty five or twenty six and was the leader or at least the one who told the other two what to do and who gave most of the orders to me he was very soft spoken and suave but extremely firm and commanding the other two were still in their teens i suppose one was a huge guy dark and hairy and very strong the other was very good looking blond and had very smooth skin they drove into a garage and pulled me from the car into the house i don't remember too much of what happened i was just so part e terrified but they stopped hitting me and i agreed to do whatever they wanted and had slipped into my slave girl fantasy role these are things i remember with incredible detail and which i fantasize about still i was still fully clothed and i was made to stand in front of the two younger ones as the older one walked about me touching my hair lightly my face my breasts my throat he kept talking telling me how pretty i was and how much he was going to enjoy fucking me he began unbuttoning my blouse and finally slipped it over my shoulders commenting on how beautiful my skin was and how nice my tits were he ran his finger lightly over my shoulders and circled my breasts and finally touched the tip of my nipples he brushed them with the knuckles of his hand and took them between his finger and thumb and rolled them very gently embarrassing me by telling the other two that my nipples were becoming erect it was such a pleasant sensation i couldn't avoid squirming part f and he commanded me to be still i began crying quietly i remember distinctly when he put his hand under my skirt and began stroking the insides of my thighs his voice sounded so dirty when he told the other two that i was creaming through my panties but oddly i loved the sense of humiliation he finally made me take off my skirt and my panties very slowly so we can watch your tits as you bend over then i had to stand naked in front of them and turn slowly so they could look at me and i knew exactly how that heroine slave girl in my fantasies felt as she was being auctioned i was lying on the floor and the big one was lying across me perpendicular to my body he was toying with one nipple with his hand and licking the other the older one told the young blond one to lick my cunt the older one lay down next to me and began kissing my face and stroking my hair all the sensations were driving me out of my mind i have never be fore or since had so many part g fantastic things happening to my body at one time i couldn't concentrate on one i tried to ignore them but i couldn't i'd try to think of something else how much i hated these men but then the blond one would suck on my clit and flick it with the tip of his tongue and i would just feel him and what he was doing and then the big one would circle my nipple with his tongue and then the blond one would move his tongue very rapidly back and forth across my clit they kept saying things like you like to have your clit sucked don't you and you like having your tits and your cunt licked at the same time don't you i'd try to ignore them but there was no way in the world you can ignore the moist warmth of a soft mouth gently persistently exciting your clitoris i tried desperately to suppress having an orgasm but the older one kept encouraging me go ahead baby come baby come you love it and i came it was so deep and intense it was fantastic part h i get hot just thinking about it and writing this letter i'm wearing benwa balls those gold little japanese balls you put inside your cunt and which vibrate when they click together and i've been unable to keep my hips still while i'm typing this and have had an orgasm while i'm typing it's great they took turns fucking me after that i was still ex hausted from being licked into having an orgasm and was in almost a dream but i remember so many of the sensations each one of them was different and felt differently inside of me and on top of me and fucked differently i know i came again several times i can't remember how many times each of them fucked me or with which ones i had orgasms the older one fucked me first i remember he put his prick deep into my cunt so that he was pressing very hard against my clit he barely moved i remember pressing my cheek against his shoulder and feeling the hardness of his prick inside me filling me when i moved my hips part i he commanded me to just lie still just lie there and feel my prick in your cunt just lie there and get fucked i remember feeling an orgasm welling up inside me in spite of everything i did i actually wound up asking him to please please fuck me please let me come i know that eventually i was thrusting as hard against him trying to fuck him as he was me i actually was fucking the man who was raping me and enjoying it tremendously the young one fucked me very rapidly i remember and i remember putting my legs around him he was so slender the big one fucked me more than once i know i just remember staring into his chest it was a curiosity to me then just how differently each one felt and how each moved that in itself i find exciting i had slept with only two other men before that i was a virgin until my junior year in college when i was twenty i didn't like or dislike that experience i was too curious then i suppose i slept with one other man part j three times after that i had hoped that we would be married but we broke up i had dated the man i later married twice before being abducted but we had never gone to bed together we all rested for a while and then the older one said he wanted to watch me sucking the blond one's prick i had never sucked off a man before and was frightened he threatened to cut off my tits and flashed a knife and i finally agreed but the blond boy either was reluctant or was pretending to be the older one put the tip of the knife at my throat and said he would give me fifteen minutes to have that kid come in my mouth the boy was sitting on a sofa and i went to him thoroughly terrified i got on my knees but he pushed me away the older one said coax him make him want it and i found myself sitting next to him playing with his cock and kissing him trying to brush my nipples against his lips to make him hot and whispering into his ear and begging him to let me please suck part k suck his prick i was encouraging him to put his hand between my legs and was spreading my legs to make it convenient for him and telling him how wonderful i would make it feel if he would let me suck his prick in the back ground the older one kept saying ten minutes left finally the boy consented and i got on my knees between his legs i remember how hard and firm his prick was and how the smooth skin seemed to slide over the hardness of his shaft when the older one said five minutes baby i was sucking and licking desperately frantically one of them i don't know which one pulled my hair away from my face so that the older one could watch his prick going in and out of my mouth better i had never sucked a man before but the thing i re member most about my feelings at that particular moment was that i couldn't remember ever feeling as female as then i was thoroughly aware of the ultimate symbol of masculinity directly in front of my face in my mouth part l i was aware of the power and strength of these men over me it wasn't just my femininity i was aware of it was my femaleness if that can be clear i enjoyed sucking his prick immensely and i enjoy being made to suck my husband's when the boy came i felt a sense of mastery in being a woman i felt complete i enjoyed it so much they kept me for several hours after all this i had to wait on them serving them pizza they actually sent out for one and one of them held me in a basement family room when the de livery boy arrived with a knife at my throat they suggested giving me to the delivery boy as a tip and i had to kneel after serving them wine while one of them poured wine into my mouth i was ordered to fuck them as they lay on their backs i don't think i came again i was exhausted i guess and i be came frightened as time passed and there was no move to let me go finally they allowed me to dress and they drove me to about a block from my apartment and part m let me out they parked my car back in the supermarket parking lot and i got it the next day i went home and bathed and slept straight through for eighteen hours after i got home i never called the police about it i stayed home for three days after that and masturbated when i recalled my favourite parts of the incident reliving them i had a date with larry the saturday night after that we were supposed to go to dinner and to the theatre but when he arrived i told him that i wanted to stay there and i wanted him to make me fuck him i told him the whole story of the abduction about how i enjoyed it he sat in a chair and told me to stand in front of him then he told me to take my dress off and that began our relationship really we were married a year later when we are alone we still play out the master slave relationship he'll call me from the office before he comes home and order me to undress and wait to be fucked it is extremely pleasurable to greet my part o husband at the door when i'm either naked or wearing a sheer chiton and wait upon him and do loving things to him and for him he has a friend who stays with us over weekends several times a year while in town on business trips and larry always has me wear a rather seductive low cut cocktail dress when frank visits he has me light frank's cigarettes and i enjoy watching frank's face as he looks down the front of my dress larry has forbidden me wear bras it turns me on also when larry tells frank how great i am in bed or how well i suck his prick it embarrasses me but it is fun larry also has threatened to order me to sleep with frank during one of his visits but so far he has not i will if he tells me to i know this may sound as though i'm pretty kinky but for the first time in my life i'm feeling free sexually and thoroughly satisfied i don't have many of the hang ups my girl friends seem to have i'm involved in the junior women's club and work as a part p volunteer once a week at the children's ward of the local hospital i do all the things my girl friends do so can it be all so bad to find so much pleasure sexually in the way that my husband and i find satisfying certainly your book would indicate that other women would love to live out their fantasies the way i do mine they should it feels so good can it honestly be so wrong i don't think so love and sincere thanks again the end now please review parts you will understand the questions i have put forward before i have put this story up as no one had read it and were making comments about our discussion thx thanks phantommoon yes it would be arousing for the reader as cecilia was aroused what is certain is that although she had a pleasurable experience she was technically raped and the rapists committed a crime now if nancy friday puts her story in a book which is designed to arouse women and no doubt the vast majority of women readers would masturbate over this story then it means that the women readers are condoning the crime they are aroused by the crime that the rapists had committed hence they are indirectly supporting the rape because cecilia enjoyed it if cecilia's rapists were to read this story they would feel vindicated and not ashamed and the fact that cecilia did not call the police shows that they had committed the perfect crime where the victim enjoyed getting raped immensely and didn't bother calling the police would be rapists who read this story would also feel inspired rather than deterred from committingt such crimes do you agree thx to all those would be rapists and rapists already this is what they believe that what they are doing is every women's fantasy i can assure them sickos that this is no fantasy of mine yes i enjoy rough sex and the like but i do not want some beast just taking what he wants speaking from experience this is absolute tripe and this is just giving cause to them rapists out there if she felt like that couldn't she just keep it between her and her husband she made it out to be like some romance novel please how many people who are raped cans say it was such a fantastic experience as she has made it out to be if this was a fictional storey then that could be seen as erotic or even if it was part of role play but not as an actual experience

if women understand men why do they continue to complain most women think they understand men right so if thats the case all the complaining should stop or is it that women just complain about men they can't manipulate or figure out oops i think i'm on to something the secret is women don't really understand all men what women do is what all yes i said it all humans do that is they make sweeping generalizations based upon a few possibly extraordinary examples of men if women really did understand men then you are right in that you suggest they should try to change the situation instead of complaining that would be more helpful than simple criticism on your second point the fact of the matter is that some women think that they can manipulate any man and of course they are wrong there is no doubt that this is frustrating for some but many may also have the mentality of 'there's a sucker borne every minute ' in this they are correct some of this type of thinking may also be due to feminist influences women could also just be 'anchoring their' opinions that is they let a few past experiences color their current view of men and thus jump to a sweeping generalization of all men women complaining could be due to self serving bias in that they only see the 'bad' in others and not the 'bad' in themselves  Abortion debate Ontological argument Ethics Political correctness Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Transactional analysis Gender-neutral language Object-oriented programming Causality Transsexuality Philosophy of language Opus Dei David Hume Feminism Scientology beliefs and practices Epistemology Free will Sexual orientation Time travel Mind control Religion Animal rights Scientific skepticism Cultural relativism Supernatural Homophobia Nation of Islam Neuro-linguistic programming Killian documents Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Intelligent design Utilitarianism Philosophy of mathematics Falsifiability Class (computer science) History of intersex surgery Ex-gay Domestic violence Magical thinking Franz Boas Dissociative identity disorder Masculism Biblical inerrancy Cyberspace The nature of God in Western theology John Lott Internet troll Reparative therapy Person New Testament Goodness and value theory Problem of universals Fictional character Static Shock Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) God and gender Mary Wollstonecraft Logic Philosophical Investigations Psychology Generation X Psychosis Nuclear option (filibuster) Friedrich Nietzsche Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Amnesty International Creation according to Genesis Androgen insensitivity syndrome Metaphor The Shining (film) George Fox Theodicy Child sexual abuse Social rule Philosophy of history Media bias Psychoanalysis Behavioral finance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Homosexuality and transgender Badminton Prisoner's dilemma Civil rights George Lakoff Faster-than-light Appeal Nineteen Eighty-Four Emotional intelligence Self-concept Special relativity Gender role Human Meme Mathematics Bullshit!

are my friends sexists i had lunch with a two friends a couple it was raining as we left the restaurant my friend's wife asked him to get the car and bring it up so she wouldn't have to get wet he did no big deal she said that he does it all the time no surprise to me since that is not an unusual kind of thing for the men to do for women in my circle of friends we simply treat women better in situations like that but i got to thinking what if she were a feminist would she expect the man to always be the one to pull the car up in bad weather that certainly wouldn't be equal in fact she would probably consider that to be sexist would she have gotten the car for him this time since he got it for her last time or would they have both gotten wet to ensure equality carrie they both were wearing nice clothes in a light rain the car was just a few seconds walk away and they were going home this is what he always does and this is what she expects because that's what men are supposed to do for women and you're smart enough to recognize it but since it's him being courteous it's not sexist what if for example he always expected her to pull up the car for him because that is what women should do for men i doubt you would consider it common courtesy allegra the contortionist logic that you use to pretend you don't notice the feminist hated gender roles when the woman is on the receiving end is embarrassing i know you are way smart enough to recognize this scenario see tk and waswisgirl 's answers if you're going to be a feminist be a feminist we may not agree but we will respect you more i agree with waswisgirl very seldom but she can be counted on to always stick to her feminist principles athalia no it is simple and there is a steady pattern feminism uses terms like sexism oppression and patriarchy when the woman is the one expected to serve when it's the man somehow it's always common courtesy waswisgirl i respect your consistency you are one of the very few feminists who seem to practice equality even when it might be convenient to suspend it out of convenience the mrs and mojo you do know we are talking about gender roles here he got the car because that's his role as the man what if she was expected to do all the cooking and cleaning because she's the woman i thought feminists rejected fixed gender roles and why do some feminists call it common courtesy and politeness when it's the man serving the woman but when the woman is expected to serve the man because it's her role it's sexism oppression the patriarchy etc carrie pls re read the question i did state in plain english she said that he does it all the time you re are too smart to be believed when you pretend that you have no idea that what bringing the car up all the time implies taking turns to cook fine that is equality if only he pulls out chairs opens doors etc that is inequality see the difference i m just observing what many people have repeatedly identified as a convenient inconsistency when women have a traditional expectation such as cooking is your job there is public outcry in the feminist forum oh the oppressive patriarchy but when men are expected to be gentlemen crickets feminists looking the other way i have observed this countless times if you re going to hold to feminist values fine just don't make convenient exceptions walk in the rain too if you re still struggling with this ask waswisgirl to explain it allegra they are my friends as i said i didn't bump into them i know them she is not a feminist by any means she is happy that her husband has no problem in making sure she doesn't get wet because she is his wife the woman her husband is the head of their family because he is the man of course you probably you consider that objectionable but they are happy you seem to think that just because people maintain gender roles that women become subject to abuse and disrespect what odd thinking i know many hundreds of people who grew up in a traditional household and there was no abuse or disrespect by anyone why do you think that people who are not feminists are either abused or abusers most of the people in this country us are not feminists and lead reasonably happy lives without abuse or disrespect i think it's courtesy but i don't think she's a feminist well at least i hope not otherwise she's a hypocrite  Gender role Theory of conduct Domestic violence Mojave people The nature of God in Western theology Feminist movement Avenue Q Fathers' rights Epistemology Masculism Infantilism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Civil rights Humphrey Bogart Goodness and value theory Sexual orientation Simone Weil Little Britain Transsexuality Homophobia Patriarchy Objectivist philosophy Esperanto as an international language Theodicy Microeconomics Milton H.

there anyone who agreed with him thanks ladies lots of great responses my intention was not to make this guy look bad which is why i chose not to reveal his name but he is someone we all know here in gws and i do hope he has a better sence of what it is we don't want i should mention there was one girl that agreed with him my personal feelings are that most women don't want to be treated badly we want to feel respected apreciated and desired my opinion what about a little bit more generalization lol ok my stand replying to the nice gentelman that sent you this message woman love being bossed around and put down sorry not this woman not even when i was very young this doesn't make me a man by the way before you think it i have a sweet nature i am caring and feminine but i don't let anyone treat me like trash woman love being made to feel worthless by powerful men who really are better than us ugh who wants to feel worthless if so there would be no sense in being alive we should'nt deny that we are less intelligent less competant our iq scores and lower income along with any other measures of success with prove us inferior wow i am sure you learned this from the women in your family it is a pity that you have not being able to meet intelligent and capable women well intelligent people attract intelligent people women have lower self esteem some could be but women are not doing bad at all after centuries of opression and abuse from guys like you please don't get married our entire purpose in life is to look attractive so that rich succesful men will pick us out of a crowd some women but also some men i have two brothers that have just exploited the whole family for money i have worked all my life they both are lazy sitting like kings expecting to be fed therefore i moved very far away from them they have exploited for money girlfriends and wives both of them today are divorced they deserve it because the women were the ones making the money but we really shouldnt be upset about this its just the way it is this is highly paternalistic perhaps the guy likes you and this is the only way he knows about how to communicate with a woman edit gosh i just read that supposedly this was to help him well i was perhaps too rough but i have to say that i have heard these same lines by multiple men all of them with big issues so is better to begin at least to contemplate that at the end perhaps things are not the way they were written in ancient books remember that for centuries the description of women was written by men still directing my words to this

are women giving up as i look at the world today it depresses me things aren't the way they were years ago its getting worse an example would be take a look at a music video from the 's or 's and compare them to todays music videos do you see a problem with this it really makes me sad to see year old girls working at strip clubs and sleeping with all these guys how can they let men disrespect them like this i feel as though men are overpowering women more and more and it's just getting worse some women just don't even care anymore they've given up so they just go back to the stereotypical views of society instead of sticking with their own morals how has society become this way i totally agree with you i think women have taken a huge hit with the porn industry in the internet but look at it like this the guys now are total p ssies all they are good for is sex they used to be protective toward women and children now all they think about is their m mber and they think its cool instead they are just pathetic and in relationships some of them are really high maintenance it seems to me that guys are always playing off of womens emotions we feel something they work from that kind of a lazy vampirish way to go through life if we will strip for money they will pay they dont see it as bad for women they see it as somethign we do they dont see the girl who goes home after to two kids and has nowhere else to go or someone who was a runaaway they dont see peoples real feelings they just see what they can use from women  Jennifer Lopez Avenue Q Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Male prostitute Transsexuality One Tree Hill (TV series) Sex and the City Homestar Runner Homophobia Gender role Abortion debate Sin City Pornographic actor Pitaten The Wack Pack Sinfest The Ashlee Simpson Show Human sexual behavior The Fairly OddParents Sexual orientation Recurring South Park characters Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Laura Schlessinger Theodicy George Costanza EastEnders Teen Girl Squad Fathers' rights Pornography Quarashi American Psycho St. Elmo's Fire (film) Human The Merchant of Venice Unemployment About a Boy Goodness and value theory Divorce Atomic Kitten Shaggy dog story Prostitution The Critic Married... with Children Striptease Moral Politics Women in Islam Asperger syndrome Transactional analysis Infantilism Buddy Guy Totally Spies!

does my talking about sexuality offend people in gws i can ask and answer the same thing over in singles and dating where people are supposed to be less mature and i never get violations there but here i get violations even for the slightest sexual inuendo not that it's going to stop me just wondering what gives i see sexuality as a part of gender studies and since there isn't a biology category i would hope that we could all be mature enough to discuss matters that are even taught in th grade sex ed edit sung yeah right thank you wendy it amazes me too i guess it all depends on who feels like reporting what fyi the first poster sung is not a woman he is a troll so don't waste your energy on him he was trolling i apreciate all the intelligent responses though i doubti'll hear from whoever it is that reports me oh oops i didnt know there was such a category still it amazes me that were not mature enough here so many great answers here i just wish i would have heard from who ever it is that doesnt like what i have to say personally i feel its the sexually uptight amoungst us i try to keep in mind that we are not all adults here and keep my posts apropriate but i'm not perfect i do cross the lines at times i personally am not uncomfortable about discussing sexuality you are not in the least offensive and i can't understand why others would report you however you are also quite outspoken about other areas which might bother the more outspoken trolls and i would imagine that this also intimidates them they certainly are not offensive and hurtful like the jokes about rape please do not change your modus operandi for that reason i enjoy reading your questions and answers and find them both refreshing  Sexual orientation Internet troll Rape Theory of conduct Joke Human sexual behavior Infantilism Child sexual abuse Avenue Q Milton H.

guys do blondes have more attitude than any other female species only technical non controversial answers please this is not only my opinion but i would put it as a general consensus that those blondes are more difficult to score compared to all other women for the simple statistical fact that more guys are attracted to them on average put yourself in a mixed room and chances are more guys will be drawn towards hot young smokin' blonde than any other woman as a direct result they have more opportunities to play hardball and ditch you any moment it's simply the blonde attitude here's an answer that would quite summarize it http answers yahoo com question index qid aayf r now i know it all boils down to individual personalities there are attractive brunettes chinese women and latins who would give you as hard a time but it's about a mathematical probability question do blondes win over them hands down mainly due to the media popularity has the media projected them to be the ideal for male sexuality this is not to deny another fact about their sluttiness quotient i'm not saying blondes are not approachable but brunettes and others just can't get even a fraction of the popularity that blondes do blondes are rarely ignored right all i ever hear about now is how guys prefer brunettes and blondes are overrated see your first answer i think the media popularity is starting to hurt blonde's appeal the media shows blonde women non stop and women become convinced this is the ideal so we have millions of women dying their hair blonde which is another major point the vast majority of blondes are not natural and as a natural blonde i believe that the bleached blondes are the ones that keep these stereotypes alive not real blondes i'm just generalizing of course but women grow up believing blonde is best and when they achieve this hair color it's a whole new world to them and they want to take full advantage of it blonde's original appeal was the novelty only about or of the world population is naturally blonde when women started copying what they saw on tv and what was perceived as the ideal blonde lost some of it's appeal i guess dying the hair blonde can be seen as a cry for attention and men pick up on this and see easy prey hence the stereotype of blondes being easy but to answer the question i don't think blondes necessarily have more attitude the answerer in the question you posted sounds like she's years old so don't take it too seriously blondes are assumed to act a certain way and some women act the part out without even realizing it in the end though hair color is irrelevant people are individuals and we really shouldn't generalize people by how they look even though we just did  Gender role Blonde on Blonde Blond Aristasia Species Sexual attraction Sexual orientation Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Theory of conduct Physical attractiveness The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Joke Hair Doomsday argument The Ashlee Simpson Show The Inside Abortion debate Scientific method Fischer Random Chess Gender-neutral language Aerial (dance move) Theodicy Bayesian inference Ontological argument IP (complexity) Reservoir Dogs Normal distribution Fast bowling Reality Epistemology White (people) Sudoku Avenue Q CPU cache ELO rating system Kasparov versus The World Expert system Friends Serial killer Butch and femme Villain Kylie Minogue Many-worlds interpretation Biology and sexual orientation Homosexuality and Christianity Economic inequality Social rule Homophobia Plame affair Violin Human Cultural relativism Sub-Zero Ra (board game) Skinhead Monty Python Saved by the Bell Extreme Programming Volleyball Altruism Internet troll Esperanto as an international language Table tennis Simone Weil Postmodernism Homestar Runner Infantilism The Origin of Species Philosophy of language Halting problem The nature of God in Western theology Black (people) Tic-Tac-Dough Prices of production Madonna (entertainer) Creation-evolution controversy U.S. Electoral College A Course In Miracles Phaedo Goodness and value theory Hair color Franz Boas Plurality electoral system Colonial mentality Bisexuality Pedophilia Advertising Psychology Equal Protection Clause Turing test

what exactly is post post feminism this may seem like an odd question but my curiosity has the better of me i heard someone say they were a post post feminist and i can't seem to find an answer since the word post when used as a preceedent means 'after' there can not be a post feminism unless and until feminism has ended it hasn't therefore it is incorrect on its face ie post war means 'after the war' postscript means 'after the writing' etc it is just verbal diarrhea saying something in some vain attempt to sound intelligent while having the opposite effect of proving the speaker to be unthinking edit i see from the thumbs down that some are not only ignorant but unintelligent as well keep 'em coming it just prove how fa feminism will go in its perversion  Feminism Gender-neutral language Plame affair Intelligent design Contract Irony Profanity English grammar Linguistics Internet troll Timpani The Time Machine American and British English differences Hebrew language Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Postmodernism Japanese language Second language acquisition Esperanto and Ido compared Stuttering Prank flash Dialect Atheism Slow Train Coming Political correctness Non-native pronunciations of English Aphasia G__del's incompleteness theorem Speaker of the British House of Commons Canadian House of Commons Creation-evolution controversy Aramaic language Slovak language Civil rights Quebec French Ubykh language David Irving Korean language Polish language Chinese language Women in Islam Meaning Varieties of Arabic Lesbian Standard Mandarin Apostrophe (mark) Dyslexia Prime number Complexity classes P and NP Paul Wolfowitz Presuppositional apologetics Timeline of the 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Fallacy Gender Extreme Programming Feminists for Life Feminist movement Controversies in autism Sadism and masochism Creationism The Usual Suspects English plural Hiberno-English Ethics Power (sociology) Slashdot subculture Susan McClary Standardized testing Transsexuality Figure of speech Meaning of life Tetragrammaton Esperanto grammar Ann Coulter Turing test Chinese character Ojibwe language Software testing Sign language Germaine Greer SAT Cantonese (linguistics) Postmodernity Pornography Hearing impairment Bulgarian language Dutch language Esperanto as an international language Crossword English verbs Mary Wollstonecraft Betting (poker) Charades Diarrhea John Kerr Infinitive Japanese grammar Newbie Queer

why do women try to act like men are unattractive and not sexy while many men state that they love women are attracted to women etc why do women think or pretend to think that men are unattractive is it foolish pride on women's part to hate to admit they find men attractive on one response to another question one woman said she only finds of men to be sexy is that true why do women hate admitting that they're attracted to the opposite sex my theory it seems like a lot of women try to act like men are unattractive i think this has something to do with a power move by many women as women want to hold the upper hand and the position of power regarding sex attraction so they act like most guys are disgusting and unattractive to many of these women suggesting that a man is sexy or gorgeous is a means of submission to the opposite sex men on the other hand do not care about this power ploy as they find it trivial and readily state that many of these women are hot and attractive here's the other question http answers yahoo com question index ylt anue ocwysp e mtojng cyxgt qid aaxvtme moxie slacker you seem annoyed and upset perhaps because i told the truth and struck a nerve instead of making personal attacks against me like a child how about addressing the issue instead i'm a random dude online and you're a random chick online your point i'm not talking about all women being interested in men i'm talking about so called heterosexual women that hate to admit they find men attractive moxie it's safe to say that you fit the description in my question as you are also an arrogant narcissit that feels insecure about stating she finds men attractive you mad lol let me also state the premise men like to feel desired just about as much as women many women fail at the ability to make her man feel desirable truth men continuously go on about hot women and women enjoy this attention despite the fact that many women pretend this attention is unwanted she likes to feel desired delicious wow the first truthful and honest post on this question so far as far as men being called players and studs when having sex with many women whereas a woman is seen as a s lut and a ho for doing the same well that is something i want to go in to later perhaps a different question however i will say that this notion is fair why for one with all of the perks and advantages a woman gets in the dating sex scene why do women want to keep all of their perks yet want to even out the few perks men get is that unfair the reason why men are congratulated and admired when they have sex with many women is that men are the ones that have to work hardest for the sex have to almost always initiate conversation and make the first move this is a lot of pressure put on the men a woman that wants sex is guaranteed to get sex and she doesn't have to work hard for it other than drop a few hints since it's so much harder for a man to get sex it's only fair moxie slacker why would i not like you i don't even know you this is the first time i've ever seen your screen name and you're already saying i have something against you i think you put way too much importance on yourself as far as you being a s lut well that was tmi on your part since i never asked but alas that description of you is not at all surprising also no one said anything about whether you're smart or not the fact that you have to announce such a thing speaks volumes of your own insecurity i have no problem with women just the misandry from women that goes on yes i was going to respond because i always respond when false accusations about me are made i stand up to lies and libel that's just who i am well this is the thing as you can see a ton of women do find men sexy and attractive and find men good looking physically but while many can rationalize this and can actually think with their brains recognize and make sense of their own sexual attraction to men some can't or rationalize their attraction too well and basically say what society has conditioned them to feel especially since so much ads and everything has to do with beauty and women beautifying that some women internalize this and feel they are the most attractive sex and men are machines or something but not realizing men and women are yin and yang men weren't supposed to look pretty like women yet that should not take away from their physical attractiveness just men are good looking in the masculine way just like women in their feminine way men look good as men women look good as women you are not supposed to compare apples to oranges and because both have attractive features that are unique to each other and thus probably i would assume the sexual attraction because other wise this judgment could be coming from one's definition but everyone can have a billion point of views or definition therefore it is not concrete and nothing more than little definitions without substance yet what is concrete is the stimulation attraction or lust visually physically that i would believe to imply the true meaning and that would be just for straight sexes but bisexuals whom more attracted to one sex in this way than the other i mean there's more to this but i'll stop now but i have chatted with women like this before like the lovely delicious stated with their feelings and after my analyzing of all these meanings and breaking things down intellectually many of the women wrote back to me like this oh wow very good points i never saw it like that before thanks oh wow very good or that's an interesting topic or perspective to bring up which after seeing it and expecting that this would make sense or should be automatically known it made me just scratch my head and realize societal condition does affect people and some women so much that they just say or think what things are supposedly are and i think to myself did these women ever step back for a second and realize truly what they are saying and the meaning behind it because it quite contradicts many things as their natural responses are concerned especially when asking numerous questions strategically i makes think like how does she not know this or is unaware of this i mean it's not rocket science just basic stuff pretty much yet she does not know how to explain or rationalize her attraction and another thing when i am speaking of this i am not talking about arousal or being attracted because of the physical i realize women generally aren't as visual sexually as men and that stuff but what i am talking about is just talking about is good looking recognition or perhaps sexual admiration which some women will fight so hard to not admit that they check guys from time to time or even a little discreet ogling obviously guys look more as the horny sex we are but women do too even if it's sparingly they have so with that said and done it can just be annoying when some women act this way or in denial because like i said it's human nature to look or admire even for women and i would assume if they are attracted to men or more so the admiration is different between when looking at an attractive man compared to an attractive woman i would assume the admiration to be sexual or more sexual while just comparison for women but don't worry it's more to do with societal conditioning for some women than them not finding men good looking or sexy etc and as i have said a good amount of women don't deny the attractiveness of men or actually think for their own and not of what is construed of society  Similarities between the

we want total equality between men and women right that's what feminism is about then why are some women constantly talking about how men are stupid dumb violent and women are so much better we're not we're equal in everything except our physical abilities aren't we sinking down to their level by saying that women are better generalizing qualities about men like they have done is it helping our cause or turning it into a joke i personally think that women like these who are biased against men give the other good feminists a bad name do these people think that bitterness towards the other gender is what feminism is about i agree every time you label yourself under an ism you will have to deal with extremists and those who misrepresent you therefore i have chosen not to label myself and instead express my thoughts and values as an individual rather than going under a name i love and respect men and women equally i would help empower anyone who needs it whether it's a man or woman all this male vs female battle is garbage like i have stated before i have a father and mother that i respect equally and that reflects in the way i treat people  Gender role Masculism Homophobia Domestic violence Transgender Gender God and gender Orgasm Transsexuality Theory of conduct Asian fetish Woman Gender-neutral language Bisexuality Sex-positive feminism Sex Gender identity Sexism The Handmaid's Tale Civil rights Sadism and masochism Homosexuality and transgender Gaze Sexual orientation Christian views of women Animal rights Political correctness Social rule Power (sociology) Men's rights Abortion debate Grimke Sisters Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Social justice Heteronormativity History of women in the United States Same-sex marriage Andrea Dworkin Homosexuality and Christianity Patriarchy Democratic Party (United States) Married... with Children Economic inequality Homosexuality and Neopaganism Entropy Peter Griffin Divorce Radical feminism Dianic Wicca Penis envy Bah__'__ Faith and gender equality Reparative therapy Autism Nation of Islam Hormone replacement therapy (trans) The Brothers Karamazov Womyn Evil Polyamory Infantilism Religion and sexuality Human sexual behavior Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Priesthood (Mormonism) Sin City Restoration comedy History of intersex surgery Final Fantasy magic Feminist movement Physical attractiveness Brave New World Dead Like Me Consensus decision-making Mary Wollstonecraft Bulgarian language Polygamy Motion picture rating system Mojave people Aesthetic Realism LaVeyan Satanism Gender-specific pronoun Androgen insensitivity syndrome Joke Biology and sexual orientation Marriage Sigmund Freud Fictional character Leadership The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India The Ashlee Simpson Show Liberal feminism Humphrey Bogart Arthur Schopenhauer Islam as a political movement Anarchism Friendship

any feminist arguments against arthur schopenhauer lol well yes i'm pretty sure he could easily be ripped apart by feminist critique i haven't read schopenhauer first hand but from studying his influence on irish author and playwright samuel beckett particularly beckett's first novel murphy he seemed to view women primarily as a constant temptation a sort of evil that men nonetheless required and could never escape from wanting in murphy for example the girlfriend and lover of the male main character murphy is a former prostitute he both hates her and loves her for it it's a rather unhealthy way to conceptualize relationships more generally schopenhauer also suggests that humans and their constant needs and wants food warmth sex turn life into a trap where a person can never obtain the ultimate there is no such thing as the utimate sex the ultimate cup of coffee that will prevent you from ever wanting coffee again you'll always want sex again you'll want coffee again tomorrow you're trapped in wanting schopenhauer was quite bothered by this idea here's his entry at the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy which notes that schopenhauer developed an instinct recognizing mystical and essentially ascetic outlook emphasizing that in the face of what he believed to be a world filled with endless strife we ought to minimize our natural desires in order to achieve a more tranquil frame of mind and a disposition towards universal beneficence often considered to be a thoroughgoing pessimist schopenhauer in fact advocated ways via artistic moral and ascetic forms of awareness to overcome what he considered to be a frustration filled and fundamentally painful human condition since his death in schopenhauer's philosophy has had a special attraction for those engaged in music literature and the visual arts http plato stanford edu entries schopenhauer good luck i rather like schopenhauer and have had him on my reading list for a long time  The World as Will and Representation Friedrich Nietzsche Objectivist philosophy Socrates Philosophy Meaning of life Reincarnation Simone Weil Friedrich Schleiermacher Goodness and value theory Free will Philo Modernism Feminism Stoicism Moral objectivism Maurice Merleau-Ponty Animal rights Theodicy Nicomachean Ethics Idealism Samuel Beckett Nihilism Sigmund Freud Spiritual evolution Postmodernism Sexual orientation Eastern philosophy Theory of conduct Bernard Williams Human nature Homosexuality Human Ludwig Wittgenstein Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Rudolf Steiner A Course In Miracles Immanuel Kant Epistemology Moral relativism Existence of God Cultural relativism Deconstruction Love Western philosophy Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Yoga Sutras of Patanjali George Berkeley Human sexual behavior Plato Logic Max Weber Ethics Philosophy of perception Sex-positive feminism Abortion debate Evil Unconscious mind Sin City Gender role Utilitarianism David Hume Art Atheism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Critique of Pure Reason Jewish philosophy God and gender Pessimism Homophobia Sri Aurobindo Summa Theologiae Civil rights Pederasty Richard Wagner Adam Smith Sexual abstinence Person God George Lakoff Libertarian socialism Minimalism Taoism Aristotle Property (ownership right) EastEnders Internet troll Religion History of sex LaVeyan Satanism

should i be more selfish with women i am brought up with hindu value s yup they are the goddess in hinduism allways followed this value s but its seems in the modern world it only back fires i mean should i drop all these value s i allways treat every women i like with respect putting their wants ahead sometimes because its important in relationships but it gets backfired when they become bossy and mistake my respect as being too nice its funny how when i want something then it is wrong but i have to do what she wants because i am a man how come is it that i need to follow her idea s of what she wants from a man but when i say it then i am being controlling how come when i talk to my gal friends then she is questioning it out of jealousy but when i do it then i am questioning her privacy some time i dont get it why do women want men to change so much but yet they are not willing to change their idea s for the sake of the relationship i just couldnt take it anymore sex should be sex not a bargaining tool love should be purely love not what she can get from my outta of my love money should be each others money not something that only a man should contribute where is the equality in this how come its not fine for me to dress up the way i want but i cant say a thing to the women about the way she dresses how come its ok for her to dress revealingly to everyone but its not ok for me to look at any other sexy women how come its ok for her to question me about my past but its past is past when it comes to her how come its ok for a women to leave men because she has found true love but when a man leaves a women its called cheating or he is a player how come sex is used as a bargaining tool isnt that worse then a whore atleast a whore is doing it out of neccessity to support herself how come how a man feels doesnt come into place how come its allways how the women feels and when a man questions it then the man is emotional its kinda sad because i do respect women but i dont see the same thing coming back sometimes i do see why some guys are players i mean like me i am beggining to lose the whole idea of trying to be a gentleman i simply dont get the same respect i never liked playing games and allways are truthfull about myself but how come all this things are taken lighty i dont get women who wants man to be sensitve towards what women wants well i did that and i know the reason why most men are not because it gets miss used see man is there for women and likewise i understand that but if i dont get the same respect then its no point in trying to be that perfect guy its tiring i am a person first of all i am not a slave not someone who will become your puppy well maybe thats why men are not sensitive i know i cannot be anymore because my niceness is often being used as a tool for their well being love is love sex is sex money is money no more contradicting rules from women i know this is type of answer im gonna get go for the theraphy grow up be a man thats the way it is etc well i will also get some women telling me how i am an a for telling this but in real fact thats why men cant be sensitive men are men because of this see how my experiance changed me men behaves in such a manner because they know if they were to change being a man then you will have two females in a relationship and when that happens there goes the balance system in the relationship it takes two of the opposite to make a thing work i kinda understand that concept so from now on im gonna be myself ditch the women who disrespects me think about me first and well sex is gonna be sex long gone are the days where men are blamed if the relationship gone bad i think women should think about their responsibilties too instead of shoving their idea of a perfect guy instead of loving a person for the reason of love hmmm change is good human nature when dealing with another human being in the context of a relationship balance is the ticket most women whether we want to admit it or not like a combination of nice guy and challenge especially in the early stages if you come on too strong with the worshiping thing its most likely going to backfire people respect those that have enough self esteem to stand up for themselves and not get walked all over also i don't mean to judge you i offer this as constructive criticism ive seen plenty of your posts i usually avoid your questions because they are so long and boring and rambling if this is how you converse in your day to day life if you over talk and ramble that could be a huge reason that you have relationship problems no offense but you might want to dial back on the over analysing rambling good luck edit you're ideals are so black and white its that gray area of balance that makes for relationship harmony  Social rule Theory of conduct Simone Weil Past teachings of Prem Rawat Avenue Q Meaning of life Sexual orientation Human Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity

is sex is sex for the modern day women i mean is it safe to say that i dont have to worry about how they feel about it because its their duty in the modern day to be responsible for their own act rather then blaming the guy so you do think i have to be a little hypocritical about it then well just for arguing sake if a women chooses to leave a man because she doesnt like his sex then its fine but why when a man leaves her then it becomes a diffrient story if the ladies are open to casual sex then they should be responsible for this kind of scenario sex is not a bargaining item as long as you have sex with an adult and are honest it is her responsibility to make the right decisions and take care of herself if she chooses to have sex with you it is her decision as she has her own free will to say yes or no sex is for mutual pleasure not exchange of favors so if a woman sleeps with you in the name of casual sex expecting something else it's on her not you  Human sexual behavior Polyamory Bondage (BDSM) Anal sex Sexual intercourse Transsexuality Abortion debate Oral sex Feminism BDSM Sexual orientation Social rule Sexual revolution Gender role Human Gay bathhouse Orgasm Same-sex marriage Children of God Sex-positive feminism French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Friendship Homosexuality and Christianity Free will Birth control AIDS Androgen insensitivity syndrome Zoophilia Stewie Griffin Age of consent Pederasty Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Goodness and value theory Infantilism Avenue Q Rape Phone sex One Tree Hill (TV series) Atomic Kitten Sadism and masochism Bisexuality Humphrey Bogart Prostitution Casual relationship Divorce Strap-on dildo Patrick Hillery Adoption Sex toy Athenian democracy Feminist movement Democratic Party (United States) Alignment (role-playing games) The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Ethics Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Economics Theory of conduct Harm reduction Homosexuality and Islam Marriage Child sexual abuse The Merchant of Venice Nudity Homosexuality in Japan Prisoner's dilemma Politics of Canada Margaret Mead Big Brother UK series 6 Transactional analysis Homosexuality Sex education Masturbation Sento History of sex Orgy Theodicy Statutory rape Fathers' rights Childlove movement Safe sex Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Little Britain Same-sex marriage in the United States Sex and the City God Emperor of Dune Laura Schlessinger Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Pornography Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Gender Child sexuality Hillary Rodham Clinton Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Same-sex marriage in Canada EastEnders Grimke Sisters Presidential system AIDS pandemic

why are male humans not seen as the more attractive sex as in the animal kingdom in most species of animals the male exhibits more visually appealing traits ie bright colored male avians with females having duller physical traits it is said that the male is designed evolved this way to attract the female why then with humans are women seen as the more visually appealing sex believed to appeal to men in the case of humans is this a result of nature or a nurtured society meaning a matter of perspective your thoughts well its not completely true in the animal kingdom for instance that spieces of sand crab that has the males wave down the females with their prominent claw as the femalse strut through the area in which the males have built their dens or the praying mantis black widow etc but actually i think males are the more beautiful gender in the human race i roll out of bed might shave might not i slap my hair around put on a clean shirt and tie and the women seem to dig it no assembly required  Sexual attraction The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Gender role Physical attractiveness Gender Human Man Hair Baldness Woman Sexual differentiation Gender-neutral language Cat Human nature Orgasm Crab Gender identity Hentai Transgender Tarantula Bisexuality Spider Homosexuality and Christianity Monogamy Grammatical gender Horse Sexual dimorphism Heterosexuality Effeminacy Evolutionism Sexual fantasy Human sexual behavior The Origin of Species God and gender Nature versus nurture Dog Homosexuality Culture Intersexuality Sociobiology Sex assignment Zoophilia Color Sento Biology and sexual orientation Breast Sexual orientation Sociology Sinfest Hermaphrodite Guinea pig History of intersex surgery Condom Art Emotion Homosexuality and transgender Civil rights Color blindness Dragons (Pern) Heteronormativity Mantis shrimp Puberty Beard Bird Simone Weil Depilation Androgen insensitivity syndrome Gay slang Neolithic Revolution Cross-dressing Clothing Evolution Reproduction Intersex surgery Transsexuality Polarization Eusociality Salic law Undergarment Gaze David Hume Creation-evolution controversy Bish__jo game Pubic hair Vagueness Pok__mon Abilities Mountain Gorilla Language Coconut crab Platypus John Money Sexual intercourse Pedophilia Marriage Meaning of life Religion and sexuality Dragon Booster

do you agree with the views of the author r v connell in his book masculinities connell argued that there is no such thing as a single concept of masculinity but rather that many different masculinities exist each associated with different positions of power i think it depends on where you are examining the idea from if we are talking a multiple culture scale then yes of course that makes sense if you are looking at just one culture and trying to examine ideas of masculinity within it then at least in my culture it seems as though there is one over arching ideal for masculinity but multiple ways of expressing it and embodying it for example being a ceo with a power suit and tie is seen as masculine but so in heavy labor such as construction however both have their roots in a powerful image that we associate with masculinity only one is physical power and the other is financial i would take the concept of multiple masculinities in this case and say something more like multi faceted masculinity also if we want to take this farther than just concepts and expectations of gender then again we run into the obvious answer of yes yes of course there are different identities that still coincide with being male i feel as though the expectations that come along with being male are just as dangerous to men and the possibility of different masculinities and individualism as the gender expectations for women  Gender role Gender Gender-neutral language Sexual orientation Feminism Masculism God and gender Philosophy of language Bulgarian language Gender identity Man Transsexuality Goddess Heteronormativity Physical attractiveness Social constructionism Grammatical gender God Culture Biology and sexual orientation Human nature Reparative therapy History of intersex surgery Power (sociology) Capitalism Neopaganism Androgen insensitivity syndrome Liberalism Esperanto vocabulary Friedrich Schleiermacher Gaze Confucianism Property (ownership right) Transgender Masculinity Hierarchy Brahman Species Sexual differentiation Simone Weil A Course In Miracles Asperger syndrome Socrates Effeminacy German grammar Asian fetish Economic inequality Carl Jung Adjoint functors Fight Club Spanish nouns Cross-dressing Postmodernism Hebrew grammar Homomasculinity Maurice Merleau-Ponty John Money Reality English grammar Homophobia Social psychology Anthropology Theory of conduct Patriarchy Christian views of women Intellectual property Narcissism Catalan grammar Susan McClary Philosophy Rape Leadership Free will Polyamory Anarchism and capitalism Immanuel Kant Meaning of life Gender identity disorder Hypnosis State Ethics Chinese language Scientific method Homosexuality Political correctness Yoga Queer theory Labor theory of value Democracy Sex-positive feminism God the Father Arabic grammar Penis envy Baldness Civil rights Philosophy of space and time Autism

is this one of our innate differences women do not like to have their body parts stared at or commented upon but men seem to appreciate it as we can see from the responses to this question http answers yahoo com question index ylt an ydjapiuwm upv kminqyxgt qid aazuqnp can this knowledge help men and women to get along better somehow how would you use this information to promote harmony between men and women i think it's because of the different ways men and women view sex oggling implies a desire to have sex with you since men have a high sex drive and feel sexually attracted to most women they take a woman appreciating their sexual body as a compliment and a potential opportunity since women are choosers and mostly don't want to have sex with random people it makes them feel violated and threatened instead it's definitely a function of basic innate differences i think some of the others who've answered before me have good points too culture factors into it as well women in this culture have been been socialized by conservatives to feel shame about being sexual and by feminists to view being objectified as deeply insulting men not so much  Sexual orientation Feminism Human sexual behavior Biology and sexual orientation Sex Sex education Reparative therapy Homophobia Sex-positive feminism Transgender Determinism Physical attractiveness Woman Gender role Human Economic inequality Abortion debate Social rule Rape Child sexuality Sexual abstinence Homosexuality and Christianity Childlove movement The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Domestic violence Civil rights Religion and sexuality BDSM Philosophy of language Homosexuality Human sexuality Orgasm History of sex Sociolinguistics Human nature Masculism History of intersex surgery Mojave people Women in Islam Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Heterosexuality Oral sex Homosexuality and transgender Anal sex Heteronormativity Arthur Schopenhauer Sexual revolution Zoophilia Queer theory Emotion Sexual addiction Paraphilia Gay Psychology Infantilism Sexual intercourse Bondage (BDSM) Gender-neutral language Incest AIDS Sexual dysfunction Cross-dressing Lesbian The Handmaid's Tale Androgen insensitivity syndrome Gender identity Sigmund Freud Meaning of life Social justice Eugenics Asperger syndrome Religion Motivation Objectivist philosophy God and gender Political correctness Sex and intelligence Joke Statutory rape Sexism Pedophilia Serial killer Franz Boas Feminist movement Autism rights movement Education Sexual differentiation Iago Asian fetish Child sexual abuse Homosexuality and Islam Intersex surgery Postmodernism Gay rights Marriage

do most men still believe that the role of a woman is at home dear aden yes most men still believe that the role of a woman is at home only though men will never admit to this fact because the other name of man is ego whatsoever is asked to men is always replied by them after duly weighing it on the scale of their ego this is a male dominating society if in a developed country like uk women are still getting wages lower than men if the women are still being raped in the so called civilized world and if more than per cent woman are still beaten at homes by men all over the world irrespective of the fact whether they live in the rich or poor countries it is a testimony in favour of your question in the affirmative you should know aden that men are the most hypocrite creatures of all men know how to please woman once a while a woman prime minister is selected in a country's history or some pilots or doctors or professors but how many what is the ratio as compared to men how many women have got noble prize how many streets and roads on this globe are named after women it is clear that men dont like women in the lime light of course women have proved time and again that they can be as good as politicians as men or as good as climbers or doctors or engineers in every sphere they have proved but it always hurts man when he sees that his wife is doing better than him outside the home after so much evidence of the woman power still they are within the four walls of the home as far as earning is concerned man thinks that woman should contribute to his income but once she comes back home after a hard day's work she is to take care of the children home cooking laundry and then finally provide sex to him that does not mean that there are not men who dont want their women to rise above who do not help them at home but what is the percentage of such men being a doctor a journalist and a globe trotter i have had been meeting thousands of people all over the globe and i am of the opinion that all men in general are same and they think that the role of a woman is at home and one thing finally aden this world will never change men will never change and the male psychology will remain same my views could be debatable but these are my views and i am a man and i know when i speak in favour of women and about their role how much negative is said about me thanks for giving me time and sorry to those who donot agree with me  Economic inequality Gender role Sexual orientation Domestic violence Appeal Mother Teresa Plame affair Homosexuality and Christianity Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Israeli Arab Monarchy in Canada Feminism Transsexuality Debate Gender-neutral language Public policy Guns, Germs, and Steel Homophobia Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Abortion debate Inflation Simone Weil Marriage Commonwealth of Nations The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Rape Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sydney Riot of 1879 Biology and sexual orientation Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Capitalism Theory of conduct John Kerr William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham Affirmative action Divorce Physical attractiveness Woman AIDS pandemic U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Same-sex marriage Leviathan (book) Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Gender identity Kevin B.

was it ever the fashion for women to wear dresses in public that fully revealed their breasts reading war and peace i got the impression that this was the case is it so also since many women are clearly happy to flaunt themselves with revealing clothes even sixth form students in supermarkets during their midday school break is anything considered indecent today will we soon see a return to the sort of thing that tolstoy wrote about this was certainly the case in europe by the time of the napoleonic wars in june just prior to the battle of waterloo the duchess of richmond had a ball in brussels at which many of the young ladies wore the latest styles in dress which completely exposed their breats apparently the style including rouging of the areolae to enhance the spectacle the style died off fairly quickly however and was effectively banned when queen victoria ascended the throne she would not have been amused one thinks technically only men can be indecent in public in the uk this is a throwback to victoria who would not give royal assent to a bill that applied to both sexes because she did not believe women could do such a thing is anything considered indecent today good question jeremy clarkson in baggy jeans springs to mind  Edward VIII of the United Kingdom Social aspects of clothing Undergarment Nudity Buckingham Palace Anne of Great Britain Trousers Breast Royal Assent Regency Acts George VI of the United Kingdom British Royal Family Indecent exposure Swimsuit Elizabeth I of England Edward VII of the United Kingdom Heir Apparent Parliament of the United Kingdom Fashion British monarchy Magic (illusion) Henry VIII of England Victoria of the United Kingdom Salic law House of Bourbon Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough Little Britain Order of the Garter Napoleon Dynamite Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh Gay rights Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon Napoleonic Wars Sexual revolution Louis XV of France Order of succession Victorian fashion Line of succession to the British Throne George V of the United Kingdom Duke Governor General of Canada Mary of Teck French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Stonewall riots Cross-dressing Have I Got News For You Shoe Indecent pseudo-photograph of a child Flapper Football Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge George III of the United Kingdom Drag (clothing) Japanese tea ceremony Mami Wata Parliament of Canada Hundred Days Sex Succession to the British Throne Hundred Years' War Leo Tolstoy Mary I of Scotland Social rule Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall Anne Louise Germaine de Sta__l Coronation of the British monarch 21 July 2005 London bombings Mary I of England We Belong Together Charles, Prince of Wales British princess Monarch Hatshepsut University of Bristol Contract Military uniform Constitution of Ireland Socrates Gay bathhouse Skirt and dress Eton College James Gillray Marie Antoinette Princess Alexandra, Duchess of Fife Aikido Camille Paglia Scenes from a Memory Same-sex marriage in Canada Monarchy in Canada Obscenity The Critic Tennis Durham University Gender role Bob Jones University Jacobitism Abdication Crisis of Edward VIII

feminists would you rather have a male president who is qualified to be president or a female one who isn't is your desire for a female president based merely on jealousy that noone of your gender has been in office or do you think that there is something that a female president could offer that none of the presidents so far have penguinese i'm not saying that women aren't qualified i'm just saying that if a woman ie billary runs for president she shouldn't be voted for just because she's a woman she should be voted for based on whether or not she is presidential material qualified you're kidding me right a chimp would be equally qualified as our current president all i'm saying is that i don't want a woman president to be elected just because she's a woman nothing more and nothing less to generalize your question i would rather have the most qualified person male or female like answer faerie v t said genitalia doesn't matter because i have a penis and someone else has a vagina doesn't mean that those with a vagina make superior decisions based upon the fact that they have a vagina to do so would be to commit argumentum ad personam in direct answer to your question i would rather have a qualified male who made it to the presidency through his own hard work than a female who made it to the the presidency by way of affirmative action or some need to correct a perceived social injustice argumentum ad misercordiam in response to jo's assertion that only male presidents commit acts of war this is either fallacy of accident argumentum ad hominem petitio principii biased sample or hasty generalization  Logical fallacy Ad hominem Fallacy Feminism Intersex surgery Gender identity Sex assignment Domestic violence Gender role Intersexuality Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Begging the question Vagina Equal Protection Clause Argument from ignorance Appeal Transsexuality Human sexual behavior Canadian Senate Penis envy Sexual differentiation Intelligent design Theodicy History of intersex surgery Theory of conduct Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism U.S. Electoral College Human Article One of the United States Constitution Democratic Party (United States) Condom Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Sexism Alan Keyes Homosexuality and transgender U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 President of the United States Fathers' rights John Lott Canadian House of Commons Androgen insensitivity syndrome Gender-neutral language Appeal to authority Oral sex Abortion debate Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Same-sex marriage Argumentum ad populum Gender Transgender Criticism of libertarianism Supreme Court of the United States Rape President of Germany Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004 Social justice The nature of God in Western theology Ann Coulter Masculism Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 7 Homosexuality and Christianity The Vagina Monologues Anal sex 2004 Democratic National Convention Sex-positive feminism Separation of powers under the United States Constitution Sex organ 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, exit polls Homophobia SAT John Money Propaganda Civil rights Gay slang Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Speaker of the British House of Commons United States presidential line of succession Order of succession Same-sex marriage in Canada 2004 U.S. presidential election recounts and legal challenges Strap-on dildo Female ejaculation Heteronormativity Parliament of Canada Political correctness American liberalism Philosophy of language Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) U.S. presidential election, 2000 Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines U.S. presidential election, 2008 Brian Lenihan Same-sex marriage in the United States

how many feminists equate their philosophies with egalitarians i ask this because the very wording seems to be a trigger of anxiety for many feminist has become a demonized word egalitarian floats the same belief system yet triggers no fear happy bullet does not give a chance for any woman to offer philosophical discussion with any hope of intelligent feedback he sadly chooses to head butt blindly happy you are no better than the extreme feminists you ardently complain about object an adopted philosophy opens doors in the mind and does not necessarily mean that mind is blinded to individual thought a socialist movement was not the goal of my question equality is a belief what you ask it is a general question i see no need to nitpick it this question is philosophical what do you want to hear if i were to complain about equality it would be on an intellectual level many men assume i am a gold digger and quite stupid i am a blond it is different for all specifics are truly not relevent all humans should be treated according to what they give to the world attitude productivity effort the body shell should never be a deciding factor in what a person's worth is that is my point and goal now you are nitpicking the question wants to provoke thought and discussion i feel i have achieved this discussion is a powerful inspiration and i am happy with that as enough am i to start a coup in the white house when i am older and much wiser absolutely but it will be over other issues lol it's interesting that rebel never said anything about equality until a certain virus butted its her head in the entire point of this question is that feminism has an image problem the outsiders looking in see it as a movement characterized by misandry communism and other things this is not at all true but that doesn't matter it also doesn't matter how those stereotypes started even though we all know the answer to that what matters is the fact that feminism has this image switching to the term egalitarian in general public discourse would certainly soften the blow a self identified feminist could once they establish rapport with their audience go on from there to explain what feminism is really about by equating it to egalitarianism most feminists that would call themselves humanists egalitarians tend to honestly admit that feminism has a lot of garbage in its history and rightly want to contribute to the solution instead of to the problem there are of course feminists who see no problem with the image of feminism they are quite simply deluded and tend to be the feminists who don't reason very well with skeptics and could probably care less if they educated another person about the ideals and truths of feminism thank you to those of you feminists who do not act in this manner i will add that i do not particularly agree with the term egalitarian because of its connotations but do identify as a humanist particularly one following the general spirit of this declaration http en wikipedia org wiki a secular humanist declaration  Epistemology Goodness and value theory Theory of conduct Philosophy of language Ethics Theodicy A Course In Miracles Objectivist philosophy Atheism Abortion debate Determinism Intelligent design Anarchism Intelligent design movement Philosophical skepticism Reality Deconstruction Theology Human Religion Civil rights The nature of God in Western theology Scientology beliefs and practices Property (ownership right) Psychology Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Meme Biology and sexual orientation Libertarianism David Hume G__del's incompleteness theorem Libertarian socialism Nihilism Simone Weil American individualist anarchism Left-wing politics Postmodernism Infantilism Gender role Extreme Programming Cult Microeconomics God Altruism Slander and libel Soul Person S__ren Kierkegaard New Testament Rudolf Hermann Lotze Occam's Razor Discordianism Supernatural Cultural relativism Philosophy of mathematics Feminist movement Autism Idealism Friedrich Schleiermacher Homophobia Scientific method Socrates Ideology Political economy Economic inequality Coercion Liberalism Logic Masculism Social rule Fundamentalism Religious Society of Friends Internet troll Universal pragmatics Social justice American Conservatism Dualism (philosophy of mind) Transsexuality Anthroposophy Fathers' rights Moral relativism Sigmund Freud God and gender Human nature Karl Popper Philosophy of science Evil Conservatism

feminists why shouldn't i be a homemaker i'm a mom wife and a homemaker i'm very proud to say i am a homemaker i know some women are forced to work when they don't want to so i exclude them but i believe that the declining values in this country are caused by women feeling forced by feminism to go to work children need mothers women have a special innate capability to be gentle and nurturing that men don't have though men who are forced into the situation by divorce or becoming a widower can develop those traits children need the nurturing and love of a mother and men need the nurturing and love of a wife there is nothing demeaning or oppressive in saying that a woman's place is in the home yes women deserve the right to be treated equally as men i'm not saying that women are less than men and can't make it in the workforce i'm saying that feminism demeans the true character of women saying that they aren't real women unless they deny their roles as mother and wife and try to do the traditional men's roles no odette i don't have to work and it's really nice but everyone has their own problems my own mom did have to work when she would rather be a stay at home mom i made sure i chose to marry someone who could provide for me but i also made sure i got a degree so if i need to work i can i'm sorry if you do have to work but like i said originally i exclude those who have to work and not by choice whoa kimberly don t attack me if that s your opinion fine but i ve told mine too no i don t think men are incapable of raising children i wouldn t marry someone who wasn t planning on being a very involved father secondly being a mother and wife does in no way equate to being a uterus and a maid only mothers and wives are much more important than that and being a wife and mother is not stifling any sort of dreams or talents and i never said that working is strictly a man s role it is traditionally a man s role but not strictly and how can you say that being a mother and wife is not contributing to society why do you even want to be a mother if you feel that way you do not have to be in the workforce to contribute to society and that is the bottom line thanks aph k kimberly kimberly kimberly i think i can safely say that we are not disagreeing i don t look down on women who choose to work if that s what you want fine and if you can be a good mother while you do it fine just so you know i was only responding to someone else s post with the have to work thing i wasn t being arrogant i m glad you don t feel forced to work that s how it should be but it pains me that a lot of women feel that they have to go to work to prove themselves as though they aren t worth anything unless they pay half the bills in a marriage it really saddens me and i only ask questions like this to push women to look at their reasoning for going to work feminism has evolved quite a bit from the 's when some radicals were pushing women to do more than work in the home at the time it was not womanly to work outside the home unless absolutely required like you were poor widowed or divorced since the majority of feminists and majority of women become mothers mainstream feminists thought the radicals were a bit nuts and decided they wanted a lot more options so ever since mainstream feminists have supported women to be stay at home mothers supported women to work part time outside and inside the home supported women who wanted to work full time outside the home and work inside the home and as the years went by supported men who wanted to do any of the above as well you're misinformed about what the majority of feminists want for women feminists want choices for men and women so they can pick the best parent to caretake their children personally i disagree that women should be the primary caretaker of children i've met quite a few women who should never be parents and met quite a few men that are incredible caretakers of their children but that is my personal opinion feminists have many different views on motherhood and fatherhood if you're interested in the work a feminist organization is doing for and with mothers i suggest you check out

does this successfully debunk the myths perpetrated by some feminists http www fathers bc ca feminist myths htm myth women earn xx per man's for the same work the xx claimed varies wildly false this myth refuses to take into account important considerations such as actual hours worked training job commitment etc myth men control more money than women false men work for and earn more money but women control more than of us personal wealth and spend consumer dollars for every consumer dollar that men spend myth women's standard of living falls after divorce while men's rises false this myth is based on an advocacy study by lenore weitzmann that has been long debunked for use of unrepresentative samples misleading arithmetic insistence on counting payments from the ex husband to the ex wife as if he still possessed the money and so forth weitzmann openly broke the american sociological association's code of ethics but has yet to be disciplined for it myth choice for men is about men trying to evade parental responsibilities false and sexist in the us choice for men would give men only the rights women have had since roe v wade nothing more it would not let the man compel the woman to abort see http www nas com c m trick people who oppose feminists are threatened by strong women it is manipulative and arrogant to imply that the only flaw feminists could possibly have is to be too strong trick feminists just want equality feminism is about people the anti male nature of feminists is so obvious so huge so outrageous that to discuss this myth would only dignify it undeservedly and we've all noticed that purveyors of this trick don't object when the why should feminism do anything for men trick is used trick why should feminism do anything for men why don't men form their own groups instead of demanding that feminism behave itself we do and obviously we lack the political clout of feminism but given feminism's constant use of appeal to pity it is enormously hypocritical to now say who cares about you we got ours and we've all noticed that purveyors of this trick don't object when the feminism is about people trick is used myth differences in the skills and behaviour of men and women are all caused by socialisation thus in principle all women can do most jobs as well as all men there is an enormous middle ground between biological determinism and cultural determinism both extremes are ridiculous we should not accept the socialization causes it all theory as the alternative to biological determinism trick women have it worse because violence against women is increasing at a faster rate than violence against men this is the fallacy of confounding the derivative with the function men have it much worse as evinced by the two major u s department of justice crime measures the actual victimization rates for women are still much lower than those of men trick you can't criticize feminism because no statement you make is true of all feminists this trick tries to block discussion by making it impossible to express your thought the writer simply specifies that by feminism he means mainstream feminism misandry another approach is to qualify the term gender feminism biofeminism or radical feminism and if feminism really was so random by the same token you wouldn't be able say anything positive about it trick well i don't approve of some particular feminist evil only some rare radical feminists do maybe if you genuinely don't then we weren't criticizing you but generally the statement is part of the old good cop bad cop routine do you ever actually criticize the misandrists ever advance new arguments against feminist policies or actions ever spread the word about the latest feminist outrage or do you just tell us to stop holding feminism accountable trick there is no feminist agenda sarcasm i must have been away when the agenda was handed out sarcasm that tactic has become a favorite one to deflect criticism about the activities being conducted on their behalf movements don't exist without agendas nor can they be effective without a fairly high degree of uniformity among their supporters trick i don't speak for feminism just for myself i'm not accountable for feminism feminism is not accountable for me fair enough if it came from a real non feminist but if you have argued in defense or support of feminism you have shown your colors and we won't forget it for your convenience it's also fair to hold feminism accountable for you if other feminists refrain from significantly criticizing you trick why is so important to you to argue about some particular gender issue you should be asking this of feminists not of antifeminists the feminists invented the which sex has it worse issue with all its variations and invented countless lies about it it was only when the lies were thrown in our face over and over that we realized we had to defend men why attack antifeminists for defending men and say nothing to feminists for attacking men in the first place trick men are responsible for wars this justifies many sorts of manbashing including the all male draft you mean men are sent to war surely sending a birth group to their deaths does not justify further discrimination against that group trick you're not a woman so you could never understand and when's the last time you told a female feminist she could never hope to understand because she's not a man and so the only people who can comment on gender issues are people who have had sex change operations to fraxinus the link works and even if it doesn't you can still read the additional details and didn't you have a question that focused on recognizing and eradicating trolls surely the dust you sprinkled is by you yourself if you want to post spam to my questions i'm afraid i just have to block you dracorim so the indescrepancy in the first issue makes me question the validity of the remainder great way to ignore the rest of the points i suppose we should all take up that line of reasoning and dismiss everything based on one point alone to super ruper true indeed http answers yahoo com question index ylt agwahxpb a qtkwfjvgyzehty ix qid aaffrth show profile info nekwsfaa of course it does but feminists will deny everything here just watch see my answer here to know more http answers yahoo com question index ylt

is there a correlation between the women's liberation movement of the 's and the peak divorce rate of the divorce rate peaked around at http en wikipedia org wiki divorce i believe the womans liberation movement was indeed necessary in some ways it could be depicted as a threat to the males role but i feel it was for the betterment of the family unit where it used to be women felt ashamed to say they were just a housewife today if you are a housewife other women and men feel you are alot more secure then they are and women now realize the importance of mothering at home whenever possible so the liberation movement divided the women into the women who put career first and those that put family first but unfortunately alot of women have no choice but to work as their husband doesnt make enough money to substain a decent standard of living i think women are less likely to stay with an abusive controlling husband today where before the movement women took the attitude you made your bed now lay in it todays woman usually doesnt want to deal with a controller etc so i believe women have more of a voice and thats a great thing  Domestic violence Homemaker Desperate Housewives EastEnders Women in Islam Laura Schlessinger Sharia Infantilism Gender role Rosa Parks Fathers' rights Masculism Friends Homosexuality and Christianity Women in the Victorian era Feminism Days of our Lives Transsexuality Strap-on dildo Feminist movement Married... with Children Madonna (entertainer) History of sex Hillary Rodham Clinton Polyamory The Critic Anorexia nervosa 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Knots Landing The Golden Girls Nancy Witcher Astor Cindy Sheehan Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Lauren Bacall Islam as a political movement Jewish view of marriage Marriage Freeters Men's rights Beat generation Avenue Q Birth control Self-harm Christianity American liberalism History of women in the United States God and gender Children of God One Tree Hill (TV series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prisoner (TV series) Fancy Crane British monarchy Jacobo Arenas One Life to Live Sexual orientation Uniform Resource Locator For Better or For Worse Mother Teresa Ranma __ characters Woman Billy Joel Moral Politics Hildegard of Bingen Homosexuality Fertility awareness Maude Nudity Katharine Hepburn Irna Phillips Human height American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Biology and sexual orientation Liberalism Matilda Joslyn Gage Lucille Ball Economic inequality Generation X Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Family Guy Trapped in the Closet Sexual revolution Nikah Misyar Fathers' rights movement in the UK Polygamy Free trade Public education HTTP cookie New Deal Kodocha Opus Dei Blood purity (Harry Potter) Will & Grace Shania Twain Democratic Party (United States) Emperor Guangwu of Han Phyllis Diller Kill Bill Blankets (graphic novel)

apparently they attacked mensa once what is a troll why do trolls do it recognizing trolls who is at risk when should you be concerned eradication an introduction to dross the object of this page is to bring together a definitive document to cover the utter sadness of the internet troll usually a troll is nothing more than a passing nuisance but as this page will show they can be a worry stalkers however it is almost invariably an inadequate individual who can be safely ignored this page will define the activity and help with early recognition once acknowledged trolls can take up residence and like athlete's foot can be difficult to shift and when you've finished here i recommend this fairly comprehensive guide to managing sad thirteen year olds loose on mom's computer what is a troll the term derives from trolling a style of fishing which involves trailing bait through a likely spot hoping for a bite the troll posts a message often in response to an honest question that is intended to upset disrupt or simply insult the group usually it will fail as the troll rarely bothers to match the tone or style of the group and usually its ignorance shows why do trolls do it i believe that most trolls are sad people living their lonely lives vicariously through those they see as strong and successful disrupting a stable newsgroup gives the illusion of power just as for a few stalking a strong person allows them to think they are strong too for trolls any response is 'recognition' they are unable to distinguish between irritation and admiration their ego grows directly in proportion to the response regardless of the form or content of that response trolls rather surprisingly dispute this claiming that it's a game or joke this merely confirms the diagnosis how sad do you have to be to find such mind numbingly trivial timewasting to be funny remember that trolls are cowards they'll usually post just enough to get an argument going then sit back and count the responses yes that's what they do how can troll posts be recognised no imagination most are frighteningly obvious sexist comments on nurses' groups blasphemy on religious groups i kid you not pedantic in the extreme many trolls' preparation is so thorough that while they waste time they appear so ludicrous from the start that they elicit sympathetic mail the danger is that once the group takes sides the damage is done false identity because they are cowards trolls virtually never write over their own name and often reveal their trolliness and lack of imagination in the chosen id as so many folk these days use false id this is not a strong indicator on its own crossposting any post that is crossposted to several groups should be viewed as suspicious particularly if unrelated or of opposing perspective why would someone do that off topic posting often genuine errors but if from an 'outsider' they deserve matter of fact response if genuine a brief apposite response is simply netiquette if it's a troll post you have denied it its reward repetition of a question or statement is either a troll or a pedant either way treatment as a troll is effective missing the point trolls rarely answer a direct question they cannot if asked to justify their twaddle so they develop a fine line in missing the point thick or sad trolls are usually sad lonely folk with few social skills they rarely make what most people would consider intelligent conversation however they frequently have an obsession with their iq and feel the need to tell everyone this is so frequent that it is diagnostic somewhere on the web there must be an intelligence test for trolls rigged to always say above who is at risk any newsgroup bulletin board forum or chatroom can attract trolls but they don't have the brains to attack nuclear physicists and they are drawn to the quick response where sex religion and race are found so politics is easy prey one troll famously tried to infiltrate a mensa group the results read like trolls and one regular it didn't have a chance but it was stupid enough to persist until removed when should you be concerned usually no though fractured funny bones and occasional waves of nausea have been reported when a troll become persistent and personal you may need to consider the possibility that it has fermented into an internet stalker equally pathetic if not more so but sometimes requiring weedkiller find out more trolls if they had brains they just might be dangerous maybe this question should be posted once every minutes hours a day i loved seeing the responses you already know who the trolls are and aren't by their response ignoring troll questions is good hard to do sometimes and they're right about when you answer a troll question they love it when you show anger and irritation but i wonder how they feel when you just state the facts calmly when answering questions i often do that because i'm not upset but like to see if it irritates other trolls not the troll asker lol and other times i answer the question and point out i know it's a stereotype so the newbies are aware they're just yanking their chain i enjoy mocking troll posts that seems to work sometimes since quite a few have blocked me i block people if i think they're stupid or crazy or boring but i definitely must get to a few of them since they still find it necessary to answer my questions even when they're blocked but they're right in the info you stated in your question trolls love it if you try to disprove their question but i do that sometimes for the uninformed not the trolls i know the trolls are a hopeless lot  Atheism Autism rights movement Theory of conduct B3ta Traumatic brain injury Cancer Deconstruction Social rule Psychology I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Blog

how can women dress the way they do and act the way they do and dare cry sexual harassment what are you talking about when women dress up or play up their personal sexuality it's not a come hither it's an expression of themselves when men or other people choose to violate personal rights it's their own decision not the fault of the victim i hope in the future you learn that women should be able to express themselves in any way they want without being attacked for it men need to learn that women need to be treated equally in this society men are more powerful and as is usual in sexual harassment cases use it to harm others to maintain their own status i suggest you research the other side and or put yourself in a woman's shoes  Transsexuality Rape Gay rights Human sexual behavior Sexual harassment Divorce Civil rights Abortion debate Lawrence v.

susan faludi what do you think of her theory susan faludi is a journalist who wrote backlash the undeclared war against women which argued that feminism and women's rights were undermined by the media and corporations just as the previous wave of feminism lost ground to a previous version of backlash convincing women that feminism and not inequality was the source of their frustration i read susan faludi's book and thought she had done an excellent job documenting the lies and exaggerations that right wingers and conservative religious figures did and still do about the women's movement and that they also do to the black peace and gay lesbian movements the right wingers like rush limbaugh and pat robertson make up lies that sound very outrageous the lies get repeated so many times in the irresponsible press that people believe it's true because they heard it on the radio or saw it in a magazine and since rush sells his hate on radio pat has his hate sold on television and the rest of the media are owned by huge corporations everyone is happy selling lies sexism racism homophobia and hate since it helps rack in the bucks how many people believe exactly what pat robertson said that feminists are lesbians are destroying marriage and are ruining our society what doesn't get stated is the rest of what he said in the same sentence since then he actually sounds crazy he also said feminists encouraged women to kill their children practice witchcraft and destroy capitalism wonder why that part of his statement didn't get the play the rest did http politicalhumor about com od funnyquotes a patrobertson htm rush limbaugh is the one who made up the term feminazi and the one who made the statement that women were doing quite well in this country before feminism came along before feminism women couldn't vote in the us how many times have we seen that same exact claim repeated on this forum that us women were doing just fine and already have equality http www fair org index php page i like fair fairness and accuracy in reporting they have a lot of interesting information about sexism in the us media with the full scoop about what really happened vs what the us media presented to the public they list some of the same topics that faludi did in her book http www fair org index php page issue area id until the us requires accountability and responsibility in reporting the hate will continue it won't change anytime soon either since corporations are making lots and lots of money the media is only owned by a few companies now thanks to deregulation americans don't get news they get ads presented as news or they get infotainment filled with misinformation and lies  Feminist movement Ann Coulter Homophobia Masculism Pat Robertson Religion and sexual orientation Civil rights Hate speech Lesbian Michael Savage (commentator) Gay rights Media in Hong Kong Bill O'Reilly (commentator) Fox News Christian right Richard Littlejohn Gender-neutral language EastEnders Economic inequality Same-sex marriage in Canada Jerry Falwell Chip Berlet British National Party Independent Media Center Outing History of feminism Gender role Capitalism History of women in the United States Susan Faludi Media bias Camille Paglia Plame affair Clarence Thomas Freedom of speech Pat Buchanan The Rush Limbaugh Show Democracy Rupert Murdoch Same-sex marriage Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them The Best Page in the Universe Wal-Mart Bisexuality North American Man/Boy Love Association Alternative theories regarding Hurricane Katrina Laura Schlessinger Downing Street memo Homosexuality The Standard Feminists for Life Reparative therapy Sex-positive feminism Homosexuality and Christianity Ethics Newspaper Karl Rove Alexis de Tocqueville Institution Anti-Mormonism Sexism Wget Advertising Free trade James Dobson Alan Keyes Anti-globalization Mumia Abu-Jamal Theory of conduct Human rights in the United States Journalism ethics and standards Racism Knots Landing American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Unitarian Universalism Advocacy journalism Fahrenheit 9/11 Cindy Sheehan Whose Line Is It Anyway?

in what situations would a girl use touch to convey her interest like you know what i mean sometimes a girl will accidentally touch your hand if she drops something and you hand it to her or one time i asked this girl laura for help on a math problem i knew she liked me let me put it that way we were sitting on a sofa and i had my notebook out and she showed me how to do it while her arm was sitting on mine touch is a psychological attempt at closeness the slightest touch between two people who are attracted to one another can have a lightning bolt effect she is probably interested if she can be bothered touching you  Milton H.

are the feminists who act like men actually sexist towards women it's like they're ashamed of femininity and being a woman i think a real feminist would be proud of being a woman and embrace her femininity critisising a woman for being a woman is probably the most anti feminist thing you could do then again some women are naturally not very feminine and they're more masculine and if that's the way they want to be then more power to them i'm talking about the feminists who try to be as un girly as they can to try and make a statement what statement you don't see men wearing bras to rebel against the male stereotype what do you mean by feminine characteristics i am a feminist yet still consider myself caring nurturing and compassionate please state what characteristics you are referring to otherwise this question is simply impossible to answer i think you would be quite surprised to find out feminists look pretty much like any other woman having said that i highly doubt they would go for breast augmentation or labioplasty by the way there are some men who could benefit from wearing a bra  Gender role Feminism Gender-neutral language God and gender Gender Effeminacy Homosexuality and transgender Goddess Philosophy of language Penis envy Woman Germaine Greer Biology and sexual orientation Girly girl Butch and femme Feminist movement Brassiere Girl Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Transsexuality Breast Civil rights Catalan grammar Thealogy Political correctness Drag queen Grammatical gender History of intersex surgery Hierarchy Asperger syndrome Heteronormativity Androgen insensitivity syndrome Masculinity Sex and the City Man Feminist theory Susan McClary U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Lesbian Bitch Cross-dressing Epistemology Quebec French Blond City Hunter Baldness Bra (Dragon Ball) English grammar Sex-positive feminism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints LaVeyan Satanism Masculism Breast implant Women in Islam Caprice Bourret God the Father Bish__jo game Homemaker Calvin and Hobbes Intersex surgery Gender-specific pronoun German grammar Ethics Feminist theology Gaze Fight Club Transfeminism Heavenly Mother Joke Gender differences in spoken Japanese Macbeth Tomboy Rabbi Little Britain Electra complex Breastfeeding Spanish nouns Social hierarchy The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Neopaganism Animal rights Maury Avenue Q Feminist economics Artemisia Gentileschi Otto Weininger Essentialism Radical feminism Asian fetish Fathers' rights Opus Dei Gay slang Physical attractiveness Solar Element Saga Esperanto as an international language Skinhead All-women band Bell hooks

nancy friday and the glamourisation of rape part pls read parts before reading this i have looked at the last parts and my questions had not been answered my feeling is that women respondents have been hesitant to condemn the real rape story that was recorded in nancy friday's book forbidden flowers because they may find it sensuous the questions that were not answered if a real rape story is included in the book where the victim cecilia enjoyed being gang raped and that the female readers derive pleasure from the story doesn't that mean that the women readers are condoning the rape and agreeing with the crime if the rapists of cecilia read the story in friday's book would they feel ashamed of the crime or will they feel vindicated would potential rapists who read the story be deterred from committing rape or would they feel inspired if women readers derive pleasure from the real rape story doesn't that contradict the message that rape is destructive thx thanks for your answer delicious this is not about rape fantasy that is separate i am talking about the real rape case of cecilia that features in the book forbidden flowers it would help to read the section and then come to my questions otherwise my question could be misunderstood to mean that i am promoting rape whereas in fact it is the opposite i e i have been surprised by the lack of condemnation of women respondents to nancy friday s inlcusion of the rape story rape is destructive and a crime hence my earlier questions are quite pertinent and seeking to establish one thing and that is that the rapae stroy should not have been included because it could be percieved to promote rape and that women readers who get excited by the story and pleasure themesleves over it are in fact condoning a crime hence contradicting the message that rape is a horrbible crime thanks for your reply pam i was not referring to fantasy the story cited in friday's book is a real gang rape that had taken place and was recorded in her book which in turn is designed to stimulate women readers i had mentioned before that rape fantasies are separate hence is not dealt with here pls read fridays's book forbidden flowers and read the story entitled 'cecilia' under the heading 'masturbation' because the story is real that is what led to my set of questions i raised above as well as the discussion in the previous parts regards thanks phantommoon that was a great response and sorry to hear about your rape and abuse you went through you are exactly right about cecilia even though you hadn't read her stroy she did fantasise about her gang rape experience hence shared it in the book for women readers to derive pleasure from she said she had tried to resist coming but she was being licked by one of the rapists and she came and then she told them she wanted to have sex because the feeling she had was irresistible afterwards she was dropped back from where she was picked and had pleasured herself over her ordeal for the next few days rather than tell the police she told her boyfriend who was turned on and played the submissive game thanks for answering the questions i had you are the only person to have done this rapists would feel vindicated by this story and that is why friday was irresponsible to include the story women who derive pleasure from the story would be condoning the rape following on from the above paragraph addressed to phantommoon the question i would like to ask women who have read cecilia's story and derived pleasure from it aren't you supporting the rape that had taken place afterall you are being turned on by a real crime that had taken place even though the victim derived pleasure from it i had a female lawyer friend sepcialising in criminal law and she was dealing with a rape case she admitted to me that she was tunred on by the rape and went to the toilets at work and masturbated over the rape case doesn't this mean she was supporting the rape i didn't get the chance to ask her this but i told her not to share this with anyone because the rapist would feel vindicated surely the stories i have cited go against the general perception that rape is a serious crime and perpetrators should feel ashamed of committing such crimes hi juliet r i have found the story and will post it in part separately look out for 'nancy friday and the glamourisation of rape part ' thx i'm not going to read parts sorry in fact ive only skimmed over this question it appears that you want to assert that women enjoy rape differentiate the rape fantasy that some of us have from the harsh reality of genuine rape no one in their right mind wants to experience true rape edit fair enough i will try to find time tomorrow too busy today to read all that i do find the topic interesting and appreciate your question ciao  Plame affair Zoophilia Theory of conduct Serial killer Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) EastEnders Infantilism Human sexual behavior Sin City 2005

is it hard to determine where s ex ends and gender begins men have extremely delicate testicles a biological fact thus it is sex however because society expects men to dominate women and other men it ascribes great strength to that fragile part of the anatomy when people says stop being a wimp and show some real balls they re doing gender likewise for women the clitoris is a part of the female anatomy a biological fact the sole purpose of the clitoris is sexual pleasure another biological fact but because society expects women to be subordinate to men it will either do gender by performing female genital mutilation as practiced in many muslim countries or it will act like the clitoris doesn t generate real orgasms as believed in the progressive western nations obviously issues of sex and gender can get quite complex sometimes it s hard to determine where sex ends and gender begins nevertheless it s a useful tool for understanding how society constructs masculinity and femininity complete article at http web airmail net ktrig out of cave mf html title masculinity femininity society's difference dividend you are right laura which is the question lol what i mean is that i was reading this article and this paragraph attracted my attention because i had never thought it in this way but it makes sense so i am curious about what other people think about the paragraph i mean flying okay i'll bite i'll admit that i got through reading a tiny bit of all that 'psycho babble' before i had to quit so far as what i thought of this one paragraph in particular okay i have used on a few occasions the bit about 'growing some balls' to motivate men however male dominance over females had nothing to do with it it did have everything to do with showing a bit of courage in situations where the guy s were expected to 'stand up' and do the right thing something that people regardless of sex hold in high regard so far as the testes being fragile yeah i'll give you that however i know from first hand accounts that you kick someone of either sex square between the legs the result is similar the issue of fgm fgm is actually most prevalent in sub saharan african countries and islam has very little to do with it this backward practice continues to this day and is most often performed by female 'medicine women' using a piece of glass or a sharpened metal object why a woman would be so adamant about inflicting such pain unto other females as young as five or six in some countries is beyond me using the practice of fgm as a parallel to how society expects women to be subordinate to men doesn't quite wash with me sub saharan african countries have their own culture and that shapes their society it has nothing to do with the society that i am a part of during my military tenure and subsequently i've had more female supervisors than male my society accepts that women can earn merit and move up was i their subordinate yes did i act like i was totally without power not in the least and might i say that my supervisors never deferred to their higher ups because they happened to be male they always fought the good fight and that's one of the reasons i worked well with some of them i did not do well with those without backbones sex notwithstanding back to answering your question as a whole i found the entire site you listed boring and tiresome to read the paragraph in question was weak in the way the author justified conclusions  Sexual orientation Intersexuality Gender-neutral language Feminism Orgasm History of intersex surgery Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sexual differentiation God and gender Human sexual behavior Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Intersex surgery Gender identity Nicomachean Ethics Sharia Zoophilia Sex assignment Transgender Clitoris Sex Feminist movement Anal sex Sex organ Bulgarian language Biology and sexual orientation Theory of conduct Puberty Transsexuality German grammar Religion and sexuality Abortion debate Rape Human Grammatical gender Circumcision A Course In Miracles Gay slang Sex toy Effeminacy Medical analysis of circumcision Homosexuality Property (ownership right) Man Bisexuality Appeal Goodness and value theory Paraphilia Child sexuality BDSM Theodicy Nudity Serial killer Utilitarianism Human nature Philo Narcissism Political correctness David Hume Legal aspects of transsexualism Spanish pronouns The nature of God in Western theology Woman Women in Islam Economic inequality Varieties of Arabic Science Social rule History of feminism Fundamentalism Margaret Mead Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Homosexuality and Christianity Merit High-heeled shoe Sexual attraction Physical attractiveness Deconstruction English grammar Bondage (BDSM) Liberalism Meaning of life Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Determinism Sexual intercourse Condom

fathers of daughters what type of man would you want your daughter to marry what traits and attitudes would you want him to have would you hope they'd have a traditional marriage or a more contemporary one why would you want to see her stay home with her kids or would you want to see her in a career share your hopes and dreams for your daughters i'm actually surprised by the lack of responses tera i thought there were enough men here that they would step up and share thier views i try to set an example for them of the kind of person should they decide to marry that i would like to see as sons in law strong loving wise and principled i'm far from perfect but every day that i wake up those are my goals someone who loves them far more than himself who is highly principled that is he actually consistently lives what he says he believes we will never have to worry about what he will do in a given situation because he is a man of principle and always tries to do what is right a man who is strong loyal loving spiritual who always puts his wife and children's' needs and wants before his own who is willing to make whatever personal sacrifice necessary to care for and protect his family and able to handle crises and life's difficulties with wisdom compassion and calmness a man who had the common sense to prior to having children equip himself with the earning potential to provide for his family without assistance should my daughter chose to be a stay at home mom so she will have the choice to raise the babies herself at home though the maternal grandparents intend to make themselves available whenever needed hopefully the second choice with daycare hopefully being a last resort i am equipping my daughters for life as independent individuals who do not need to be taken care of by a husband or her parents i do not barrage them with the concept that they must get married they understand that it is their choice from their earliest recollections and every day of their lives they have experienced the love of a man they are being taught to recognize when someone genuinely loves them and as long as i am around they will never want for love and affection so they are being taught to recognize when a man genuinely loves them more than he does himself treats them with tender compassion and puts her needs ahead of his own i am a firm believer that a girl's father has a great influence over the kind of person she choses to marry and i consider that fact every day so should they chose to marry i believe that they will have high standards and be equipped to chose wisely my daughters are both being taught to be tri lingual and early in life we have begun discussing what kind of work they want to do they will be able to be self sufficient they will not need to marry should they chose not to thus should they decide to marry and bear children they can chose to stay home with them or not they have seen that their father can provide for the family without assistance so they can target a man who has equipped himself with the necessary earning power to finance the family  Infantilism Eastern Orthodox Church Family Polyamory A Course In Miracles Divorce Predestination Goodness and value theory Socrates EastEnders Rule of St Benedict One Tree Hill (TV series) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Summa Theologiae Abortion in the United States Abortion debate Alcoholics Anonymous Fathers' rights Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Theodicy Arjuna Same-sex marriage Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Justification (theology) Marriage Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Coercion Religious Society of Friends Confucianism Original sin Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Religious pluralism Jon Secada Philipp Melanchthon Laura Schlessinger Melanie Wilkes Separation of church and state Salvation Jewish principles of faith Religion Free will Who is a Jew?

why do women file for divorce more frequently than men i don't have exact stats but i think that fact is well established not to say anything especially negative or positive about either but why do you think this pattern exists are women harder to make content long term are men simpler creatures and easier to please do men have a higher tolerance for a less than perfect or even an unhappy relationship than women are women needier than men in terms of what they feel they must have from a marriage or other reasons interesting but very sad answers it must be a very sad life to be convinced that all men are violent abusers it is amazing that the information is available yet so few have bothered to research it yet determine themselves to be experts according to the research available from the largest ever federally funded study of divorce custody and child support noted below by sanford braver at least two thirds of the time the mother is not only the one who files for divorce but the one who wants out of the marriage and it's usually not as many assume because the father beats her drinks or cheats most commonly mothers cite such reasons as growing apart or not feeling loved or appreciated another myth is that women who initiate a divorce do so because their husband has been unfaithful or physically abusive not so according to braver ''adultery is not a very important factor ranking only th in the reasons wives seek a divorce and violence ranks th '' he said the most important reason for the divorce according to percent of the mothers who shoved the fathers out was ''a gradual growing apart'' which for centuries was not even a legally justifiable grounds for divorce passage of no fault divorce allowed divorce for trivial reasons fathers who are unhappy in their marriage back down from divorce they foresee the loss of their entire family with the children going with their mom along with the house so fathers step back from the brink however mothers don't fear losing their kids  Fathers' rights Polygamy Domestic violence Marriage Knots Landing Homosexuality and Christianity Polyamory Women in Islam No-fault divorce Same-sex marriage Dead Like Me Theodicy EastEnders Appeal Rape Masculism Religion and sexuality Adultery Melanie Wilkes Child support Pedophilia Narcissism Status of religious freedom in Malaysia One Tree Hill (TV series) Transsexuality Nancy Witcher Astor Matthew 5:32 Family Paternalism Cult Ten Commandments Same-sex marriage in Canada Incest Children of God Child custody Parental Alienation Syndrome Mail-order bride Abortion Men's rights Terri Schiavo Economic inequality Abortion in the United States Hillary Rodham Clinton Friends Religion Fathers' rights movement in the UK Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Plural marriage Ernst Z__ndel Species Women in the Victorian era Feminism Boston Public Shaggy dog story Ty Cobb Prostate cancer Humphrey Bogart Civil union Aisha Mumia Abu-Jamal Grief Culture of the United States Single parent Anne Boleyn Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Romulus and Remus Another World (TV series) Christian view of marriage Legal rights of women 613 mitzvot Transactional analysis Bertrand Russell Child sexual abuse Baldness Scientology beliefs and practices Sharia Clinical depression FairTax Yoko Ono Sexual orientation Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Redundant array of independent disks Scientific method Yasser Arafat Mary Jane Watson Lawrence v.

feminists why do you think men complain about most women not being accountable do you think we're a bunch of myopic whiners do you think we're running into and concentrating on too many bad examples and it's skewing our perceptions do you simply recognize that women have more albeit relatively minor incidences of low accountability than men rainbow sounds like myopic whiner eh because most people refuse to look at their own actions and focus on themselves the way i see it b tching about what someone else did only brings a person farther from their own personal growth complaining about what other people do and that which you cannot change is a nice distraction from looking to the self and what you can change and as far as your assumptions about women having no accountability and men having more when i read your guys' posts about this and i think of my past relationships the word women can easily be replaced with girly's ex boyfriends and be just as factual in my mind it never fails that this is my largest beef when ending any relationship that they did not take enough responsibility and personal accountability then i wake up and realize it takes two to tango and the only thing i can do is walk away and try to learn from past mistakes imho both sexes have issues with personal accountability myself and you included and pointing out what others are doing wrong only another example of it  Feminism Domestic violence Transsexuality Memento (film) Sex and the City A Course In Miracles Corporate governance Theory of conduct Androgen insensitivity syndrome Milton H.

what is a bimbo is it a ditzy woman is it an immoral woman can it be a man i never liked the term dumb blond because it's really a rude term i have three daughters two who are blond and have better intelligence then most 'smart' men i've come ac cross my one daughter who's a blond has an iq of and good common sense to go with it although i also hate the term bimbo i've known more men who try to have sex with anything that's female then women who sleep around i've known more then one woman that you men might call a bimbo but were highly intelligent but had no common sense it has to do more with that i think then being unintelligent at least according today's definition of the slang word though many people think that they are of low intelligence as well i agree that they are in all probability naive men i've met who sleep around are generally not called 'dumb' nor are they naive take the movie character james bond which most people don't realize is based on a real person we'd hardly call him 'dumb ' but he had a tremendous appetite for sex most men are not naive either they know exactly what they're doing and can be very devious about it too the husband and boyfriend stealer's who enjoy stealing a husband from his wife or a boyfriend from his girl are anything but dumb and think it's a great game to play at some other woman's expense have no morals and aren't naive either i've known a few of them as well what it boils down to is that you can't profile every woman into any one catagory  Bimbo Married... with Children Naive set theory Woman Great Teacher Onizuka Joke Knots Landing The Fairly OddParents Valley girl Humphrey Bogart Marilyn Monroe Blond Daria Dumb blonde Totally Spies!

girls are boys are myths stereotypes gender differences as educators and as people we tend to assume that females and males are different are indeed opposite sexes we see someone s sex as an important predictor of their abilities and interests and assume that if we know someone is a girl or a boy we know a lot about them that assumption is wrong knowing someone s sex may tell us a lot about them biologically but it tells us very little about them in other ways knowing someone is a woman does not tell us if her athletic ability is closer to martina navratilova s or a couch potato's knowing someone is a man tells us nothing about whether his math skills reflect those of an einstein or a math phobic sex is not a good predictor of academic skills interests or even emotional characteristics how big are the differences check this paper by patricia b campbell ph d office of educational research and improvement u s department of education richard w riley secretary http www campbell kibler com stereo pdf teeleecee welcome back i missed you great answer i very much agree with you i think it is a very interesting issue if someone tells you since you are born you are stupid because you are a woman man it is possible that the girl boy would have less confidence when she he goes to school thanks for including the paper although i almost never read them having received a nasty virus from one of them but i think i know the gist of the issue there was a movie done years ago called the pinks and the blues and it's about how we segregate children into certain categories right from the beginning i e wrapping baby boys in blue girls in pink there is the myth that male infants are stronger you can tell by the cries and that they are tougher the truth is male children die infancy at a far greater frequency than do female infants and that is because the males are actually weaker in infancy male children are often left to fend for themselves while female children are coddled and overly protected by parents it used to be that males were considered to be naturally better in math and sciences but studies have indicated that males are more encouraged and more closely monitored in these fields because of the expectations of the teachers teachers have a huge role to play in academic expectations as they pay less attention to the girls who express an interest in math science and encourage the boys interested in the same fields in terms of behaviour girls are more likely to be chastised for loud play whereas boys are given the oh they're just boys treatment there are many many studies in this area trying to categorize genders into natural abilities when in fact nothing about these abilities appear to be natural they have everything to do with gender socialization rather than innate abilities separating nature nurture is impossible although scientists try studies of all girl schools show that females do much better when they're not competing for attention with males intellectually there are very few differences between men overall and women overall but women have not had the opportunity to show their stuff on an equal footing with men until quite recently obviously strength and hormonal compositions are different and will have an impact on some things intelligence is however not one of those things opportunity and encouragement are necessary for women to show what they're capable of doing and wrong assumptions will only stifle any potential that is there good question thanks edit hi fh it's nice to hear from you as well cheers  Gender role

do men get scared you notice its always the woman grabbin for the man when shes scared its almost instinct do men ever get scared and if they do how do they hide it so well yes men definitely get scared but i feel like they are afraid of different things and they deal with their fear in different ways i feel like some of it has naturally evolved and some of it is social conditioning when it comes to the fight or flight discussion i feel like more men will fight whereas women are more prone to choose the flight option note i did not say all in either case i feel like this has affected our biological development men typically are taller and have more muscle mass than women if a predator or another human were to threaten a man woman and their child in most cases the man would be better suited for fighting off the predator or at least distracting it while the woman escapes with the child thus there is a better survival rate even if the man dies the woman and child live and the faster not stronger women survive and the stronger men survive as such their traits are passed to their offspring if i am in a situation where i feel threatened or afraid rather than becoming scared i get an adrenaline rush and i become more aware i keep my cool and am ready to defend myself if i need to i'm a decent sized guy and i am confident i can take care of myself this type of attitude is calming to someone who is scared and would typically take the flight action when in danger women are typically drawn to it because it gives them a sense of security i can't speak for all guys of course but the only time i get that deer in the headlights look is when a girl brings up a subject i don't want to talk about haha  God Emperor of Dune Androgen insensitivity syndrome Dog Ranma __ characters Abortion debate The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Extinction Autism Brown Bear Gender role Anorexia nervosa Gray Wolf Evolution Kim Possible Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Transsexuality Infantilism Milton H.

violence against men ladies what's your opinion on this issue do you think that violence against men is wrong and not to be tolerated or is it just funny and you don't care at all what happens with men that's a really good question i'm going to divide my answer into parts part will be about something that really needs to be said the feminists especially should read it it's going to be about the patriarchy misandry and the power of women part is going to be an expansion of poster 's answer as his is a good one part did you know one of the reasons men are physically stronger than women and naturally aggressive is to compete for them men in the past would compete with each other hoping to ''win'' the female that would include managing a certain animal beat the other male in a fight etc our society has always been about pleasing women in marriage the man has to buy a ring for the woman woman says ''oh i wish i never had to do the dishes again'' man tries to please his woman and comes up with the dishwasher yep that's how our society is always trying to please women anyway i doubt i sound really convincing here so i'm going to explain more below feminists will have you believe that before feminism in medieval times and the likes women were heavily oppressed they'll exaggerate everything by saying things such as ''in ancient greece raping women was not considered a crime '' false thieves had their hands cut off can you imagine what rapist had the punishments for crimes committed against women were so much harsher than today's women by far weren't equal to men but they received much preferential treatment and privileges i'm not here to talk about the past though i'm here to talk about modern patriarchy and how women are doing politically economically and socially let's talk about political power first women make up the majority of voters have you ever wondered why male representatives would pass such a misandrist law such as vawa which in it passes off girls and women as the victims and boys and men as the perpetrator because women make up the majority of voters and representatives know that if they want to stay in office they have to please the majority the majority being women what better way to please women than to pass a law where only they are protected and are victimized in it never the less i guess feminists consider this oppression why don't feminists lobby for a proportional voting system here's an example men are going to vote and women are all those men are going to vote for obama and all the women will be voting hillary as it stands in our current system hillary would win with of votes while obama would lose with of votes the fair thing to do would be to make it proportional the proportional way to do it would be men voted for obama which is of men while women voted for hillary which is of women then this would translate to of votes go to hillary and to obama feminists aren't really concerned about it though they're concerned about getting more female representatives in office and the day we get more up there is the day our society will take a step towards a matriarchy and slowly by slowly it will be since women make the majority of voters and have more power than men to choose now that we know women are politically more powerful let's talk about economic power now first of all women aren't paid less than men that's nothing more than a myth and if anyone needs sources or logical reasoning as to why a wage gap is not due to discrimination then feel free to email me having cleared this out of the way let's have a look at the rest women being the ones who get pregnant get much more paid and unpaid maternity leave than men do paternity leave i suspect this is another clear example of women being oppressed by the patriarchy so even though economically women are that not much better off than men they still are time to talk about social power women in society are and always were given special privileges and benefits from minor privileges such as opening doors for them standing up when one woman enters the room taking you're hat off pulling a woman's chair opening the car door for here women children first etc to major privileges such as not hitting a woman and lesser jail times for crimes yep the majority of judges are males and go easier on the female it's even been reported that female judges go easier on males but those female judges make up a minority of judges a couple weeks ago an article was posted stating that in cases involving a child women were punished more severely well child abuse or neglect crimes are just two types of crimes men receive harsher punishment in thievery grand theft auto murder assault rape sexual assault etc yep women not being punished as they should be is definitely an example of patriarchal oppression women are sooooo oppressed so far don't you think let's talk about the media in the media men are portrayed as incapable idiots especially on commercials all the feminists will be saying ''well men are the ones in control of the media '' which is correct but women make up the majority of tv watchers and the majority of consumers in most households women decide where when and how the money is spent while the man is the main breadwinner and the woman is the one who uses the money the man gains it does seem like individually the man is more powerful since he could make the decision without the woman and the woman would be hard pressed to find a job were the man to die so yes here men hold more power but only as individuals women as a whole ultimately control the economy since they are the ones who buy stuff they indirectly influence companies profit margin and workers wages as well as the price of products  Barack Obama

how can a girl prevent herself from being kidnapped or murdered ive seen alot of news stories on this happening and im scared to like go out alone recently a girl went to like target get her bf something his b day then she was kidnapped and police found her dead so i need tips as to how to prevent this sort of thing what are you supposed to do like if your alone and then approached by a kidnapper rapist murder or such should i carry something ive heard that screaming doesnt even help any advice please tip from tae kwon do the elbow is the strongest point on your body if you are close enough to use it do learned this from a tourist guide in new orleans if a robber asks for your wallet and or purse do not hand it to him toss it away from you chances are that he is more interested in your wallet and or purse than you and he will go for the wallet purse run like mad in the other direction if you are ever thrown into the trunk of a car kick out the back tail lights and stick your arm out the hole and start waving like crazy the driver won't see you but everybody else will this has saved lives women have a tendency to get into their cars after shopping eating working etc and just sit doing their checkbook or making a list etc don't do this the predator will be watching you and this is the perfect opportunity for him to get in on the passenger side put a gun to your head and tell you where to go as soon as you get into your car lock the doors and leave a if someone is in the car with a gun to your head do not drive off repeat do not drive off instead gun the engine and speed into anything wrecking the car your air bag will save you if the person is in the back seat they will get the worst of it as soon as the car crashes bail out and run it is better than having them find your body in a remote location a few notes about getting into your car in a parking lot or parking garage a be aware look around you look into your car at the passenger side floor and in the back seat b if you are parked next to a big van enter your car from the passenger door most serial killers attack their victims by pulling them into their vans while the women are attempting to get into their cars c look at the car parked on the driver's side of your vehicle and the passenger side if a male is sitting alone in the seat nearest your car you may want to walk back into the mall or work and get a guard policeman to walk you back out it is always better to be safe than sorry and better paranoid than dead always take the elevator instead of the stairs stairwells are horrible places to be alone and the perfect crime spot this is especially true at night if the predator has a gun and you are not under his control always run the predator will only hit you a running target in times and even then it most likely will not be a vital organ run preferably in a zig zag pattern as women we are always trying to be sympathetic stop it may get you raped or killed ted bundy the serial killer was a good looking well educated man who always played on the sympathies of unsuspecting women he walked with a cane or a limp and often asked for help into his vehicle or with his vehicle which is when he abducted his next victim here it is another safety point someone just told me that her friend heard a crying baby on her porch the night before last and she called the police because it was late and she thought it was weird the police told her whatever you do do not open the door the lady then said that it sounded like the baby had crawled near a window and she was worried that it would crawl to the street and get run over the policeman said we already have a unit on the way whatever you do do not open the door he told her that they think a serial killer has a baby's cry recorded and uses it to coax women out of their homes thinking that someone dropped off a baby he said they have not verified it but have had several calls by women saying that they hear baby's cries outside their doors when they're home alone at night  Shaggy dog story Scream (film) Donald Neilson The Lovely Bones Knots Landing The Silence of the Lambs Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling throws Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ted Bundy Tag Jam (TV series) Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Beltway sniper attacks The X-Files (season 1) James Hanratty The Shining (film) Serial killer Silent Night, Deadly Night Reservoir Dogs Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Rais massacre Spidey Super Stories The Dalek Invasion of Earth Humphrey Bogart What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

degrading stuff what's a housewife isn't it degrading is it bad to think that a woman is supposed to cook and clean you can only be degraded if you feel degraded people can think i'm ugly all day long but nobody can make me look ugly unless i feel ugly a housewife is woman whose main occupation is to take care of the home the reason that some oppose this is because there has been and still is a belief that this is the only occupation women are capable of seeing it as a natural job for women feminists argue that this is a job that can be held by either gender and that a woman should have the opportunity to choose an outside career if so she wishes also that housekeeping is the duty of both men and women now i will not bring up the extremist views within feminism as they may be loud but few there is nothing wrong with being a housewife i want to have several kids and don't want a nanny to raise my children i have a great career but i'm planning to take time off to stay at home and spend time with my children when that day comes i expect my husband to do the same depending on what his job allows children need a set of parents so it is my belief that they will need to spend time at home with a father as much as with a mother i as a woman want the law and society to support this egalitarian notion and for instance give men and women the same amount of time off for a child the us is behind many other developed countries such as sweden france or england where you get almost as much paternity leave as you do maternity leave if a woman chooses that she likes to cook and clean for the rest of her life that's fine too martha stewart is a successful businesswoman who made a fortune out of the art and she is not degrading  Homemaker Gender role Gender-neutral language Fathers' rights Masculism Economic inequality Abortion debate Marriage Theory of conduct Conscription Divorce Family name Transsexuality Edward VIII of the United Kingdom Sexual orientation God and gender Freeters Ten Commandments Civil rights Incest Ethics Domestic violence Feminists for Life Fruits Basket Women in the Victorian era About a Boy Matriarchy Patriarchy Feminist movement Same-sex marriage Religious Society of Friends Paternalism Goodness and value theory Roe v.

love security deficiency drive critical analasys love and marriage main topic is it the other person you love or is it the love of security that made you want to get got married there is no right or wrong answer here sometimes it's just fun thought provoking to look at things in a different way have you ever wanted to get married but had nobody in mind to marry do you need the title of 'married' to prove your love if so to who do you think you and your partner would grow apart if you weren't married why do you feel your bond with your partner will get stronger if you get married or for those who are married did it get stronger when you got married do you think it's possible that for many people a big reason they seek marriage is due to a deficiency of security within themselves especially non religious have you ever really thought about it in depth or just gone with the flow when that's just what you're supposed to do when you love someone like that get married oh this isn't for a paper or anything just throwing out some qs and see what other people think i wanted to get married and have a family since i was a little girl took a little while to find him no you don't need the title to prove you love your spouse in fact you should have to prove your love to anyone they should either just accept it or not getting married for me was a great way to pledge my love to my husband and give him of me for always i don't think so i married my soul mate so either way i think we would have been bound by fate the bond w my husband got stronger as more time was spent together as anything else does being married definitely helps becuase we're together every day but i don't see how that relationship growth would be any different for couples who never marry but who live together for a long time yes and no i think that in today's society a lot of people get married for the wrong reasons and its too easy to get out of it look at the statistics it's something crazy like of marriages do not last i thought in depth because if when i got married i wanted it to be the one and only time i wanted to marry the right man and i believe i did to go with the flow in making such a life altering decsion isn't fair to yourself or the person your marrying interesting topic paper by the way i just hope you don't turn too many heads with your analysis remember to be subjective  Polyamory Same-sex marriage Human sexual behavior Divorce Theory of conduct Sexual orientation Polygamy Social rule Eastern Orthodox Church One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders Jon Secada Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Friedrich Schleiermacher Love Time Out of Mind Friends Married... with Children Days of our Lives Humphrey Bogart Knots Landing Sexual abstinence Same-sex marriage in Canada Philosophical skepticism Incest Age disparity in sexual relationships Another World (TV series) Bondage (BDSM) Civil unions in the United Kingdom S__ren Kierkegaard Jean Grey Meaning of life Shaggy dog story W.

have you ever heard this from a misandrist out of curiosity you know what i think's funny raping men you know what's so funny raping men beating men and killing men btw this is not something i am saying i am asking if anyone has heard this type of thing being said by misandrists i do not condone this and am appalled that someone would say this to anyone it's still not funny to be raped jackal would you think it were funny if you had a daughter she was raped or if your mother were raped yes mike i understand but i'm afraid that some men do think it's funny many more than people realize and those men do commit those acts i find it rather disturbing that someone could take pleasure in the pain of others that is something i cannot understand so hellfire what would be worse than what you jackal said was funny to do to women hm what exactly makes me a misandrist that i don't want men to go around raping women and laughing about it you have nothing with which to back that statement up if i have done anything that could be construed as hate speech it was not to the entire male population but to an individual just because that individual happend to be male does not make me a misandrist hello did you read what i wrote you're really messed up lady you shouldn't have kids i mean really messed up i hope someone takes your kids away you're a horrible mother where does that say i thought it was funny i thought it was horrible beyond words horrible hellfire you have proven with your answer without a doubt that you are completely delusional http answers yahoo com question index qid aasw cp r w pa fzpthwf bgrx ofmitjtuvhwltmfntrbxzj v rkctokhyd q paid answered dphzcdvcclr uzhdnv read my answer for yourselves everyone i haven't altered it a bit thank you jackal i did not and i re read your editted answer and now think perhaps you were referring that particular lady if so completley understandable she did bring that sort of thing upon herself with that question dorian misandrists on here i'll take your word for it i'm sure worse has been said by misandrists and misogynists both but that does not make either okay at all okay rio clone jackal you're obviously ignoring the caps right below the quotes where i say i didn't say that it's not okay so stop being purposely dumb hellfire she is a misandrist definitely i do not deny that inthe least and i didn't take your word for it because you were the one saying those things of course you're going to say you've seen worse in order to villanize women and therefore justify what you said i asked you to give an example of what was worse that raping beating and killing someone i didn't even ask for proof just what was worse instead you put words in my mouth and called me a misandrist for no apparent reason i do remember those questions posted over over over a guy asking if a woman would kick him in the balls right and yes i was appalled at some of the answers i answered a couple times that the only way i'd so such a thing would be in self defense btw so i agree there are misandrists on here i never denied that and i was actually curious if they had talked about raping beating killing men ok lycraspandex i believe you about dworkin does it make you feel better to try belittle me for having an issue with people joking about raping beating killing others how are those statements not trolling those statements are meant to evoke an emotional response much more than me truly asking if anyone had seen this same behavior in misandrists i wanted to compare the two i have heard this said before and i think it is appauling thank you for pointing it out to people most think it is a joke but the sad truth is it happens more than anyone wants to admit and the psychological damage is devastating due to the way people see men as being in charge and unable to have this weakness i think the joking about it is horrid and i would not wish this on my worst enemy male or female  Theory of conduct Theodicy Shaggy dog story EastEnders Social rule Milton H.

what do feminist think of the tony soprano character from the hbo show the sopranos i think he is a model for men not because of the crime thing but how he handles his relationships especially with women he reminds me of myself a true alpha male all girly men should watch the sopranos and take notes on how tony behaves interesting question his relationship with several of the women in his life says more than his relationship with carmela with his mother he was contrite and aiming to please until he figured her out with his daughter he gives in to her every whim and looks at her as pristine and precious it's his relationship with the shrink that interests me the most because she has absolute control over him and he knows it this is the one place in his life where he has no control and he has to give it up to a woman of all things so to the world tony is a powerful strong man in reality tony is insecure and damaged and he has no control over his emotions it is a woman to whom he reveals his insecurities and it is that woman who ultimately controls him  Gender role Tony Soprano Carmela Soprano EastEnders Jennifer Melfi The Marriage of Figaro Simone Weil Days of our Lives Soprano Objectivist philosophy Yoko Ono Domestic violence Polygamy Brave New World Meadow Soprano Roman Catholic Church Superhero Girly Mary Jane Watson T'Pol Sigmund Freud Rei Ayanami The Truman Show Sadism and masochism Rape Nicomachean Ethics Abortion debate A Course In Miracles One Tree Hill (TV series) Daredevil Fantastic Four Slander and libel Hollyoaks Will & Grace Theory of conduct Feminism Girly girl Stock character Fight Club Bene Gesserit Anarcho-primitivism Arthur Schopenhauer Social psychology Love Hina main characters Rogue (comics) Memento (film) God and gender American Psycho Themes in Blade Runner Eastern Orthodox Church Maison Ikkoku Adriana La Cerva Janeane Garofalo Knots Landing Homosexuality and transgender Undergrads Asian fetish Patrick Bateman Gaze Charmed The Smoking Room Sex and the City Phaedo Coercion Leadership Asperger syndrome Butch and femme The Conformist Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an About a Boy Economic inequality S__ren Kierkegaard Law of value G-Man (Half-Life) Masculism Ultimates Civil rights Mary, the mother of Jesus Watchmen Parsifal Drawn Together Homophobia Alignment (role-playing games) W.I.T.C.H.

what are your thoughts on women who stalk men i broke up with this woman last october because she was too clingy and boring but even to this day she still wants to get back together she will not accept that i've moved on this has made me lose all respect i ever had for her its pathetic to be so desperate and to want someone who doesn't want you sick is she showing up places you go is she parked down the street watching your every move is she calling a lot i only ask because when i see the word stalk i think of an obsessive person who won't let you move without running into them otherwise it's probably just time to be brutally honest which i know you can do and tell her to leave you alone  Scenes from a Memory Time Out of Mind About Schmidt The Human Stain The Apprentice 2 EastEnders San Francisco Giants Tenshinhan Taxi Driver Weaving Questionable Content Seinfeld Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Avatar: The Last Airbender Past teachings of Prem Rawat Theory of conduct The Apprentice 3 Knots Landing Enneagram IP (complexity) Milwaukee Brewers Second Battle of El Alamein Sin City Cigarette Smoking Man Community of Christ StarCraft: Uprising Rape Leon White Damn Yankees Kodocha Friends Monday Night Football Akuma (Street Fighter) The Invisibles Wedding Crashers God Emperor of Dune Death Comes to Time Joke Water polo Alignment (role-playing games) Sinfest 2005 English cricket season Homophobia Night (book) Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Catcher in the Rye Current teachings of Prem Rawat About a Boy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Miss Saigon Neighbours Cody Travers Textile manufacturing Stalking The Critic Zhuge Liang Daredevil Aerial (dance move) English cricket team Surreal number Columbine High School massacre Holy Orders Shawn Michaels Sluggy Freelance Boston Red Sox History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Hacker The Young Ones (TV series) Religious Society of Friends Michel Henry Trousers Extreme Programming Dogging Ocean's Twelve Descendants of Darkness Maison Ikkoku Charles Darwin's illness USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Girl (Destiny's Child song) Philip J.

if marriage has been such an oppressive burden to women in the past why do modern women still get married or are these claims of oppression merely posturing to obtain leverage and surprise more privilege in their marriages it's really people like you that feed misandrists' hate straight from the feminist's playbook if a misogynist hates it's because he's a bad man but if a misandrist hates it's because some bad man drove her to it a variation on woman good man bad lol just answer the question spare me your holier than thou attitude marriage is not oppressive in the past it wasn't oppressive but allowed women to have the freedom to be provided for i believe it was more oppressive to men because they were expected to provide for their families and expected to work hard earn enough for the family and keep the job to keep the life of their family going however it women were also looked down upon for not getting married many years ago about that in its self was oppressive but marriage was and still is only as oppressive as a woman and her husband allow it to be  Marriage Feminism Gender role Misandry Feminist movement Andrea Dworkin Same-sex marriage in Canada Religion and sexuality Same-sex marriage Divorce Gender-neutral language Sharia Masculism Germaine Greer Sex-positive feminism Sexual orientation Simone Weil Women in Islam Alignment (role-playing games) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Woman Babylonian law Christian view of marriage Nation of Islam Sola fide Nancy Witcher Astor One Tree Hill (TV series) Polygamy History of women in the United States John Cassavetes Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Incarnations of Immortality Eastern Orthodox Church 2000 Australian Grand Prix EastEnders Homophobia Culture of the United States Clergy Sexism Grunge music Tai Chi Chuan Yoko Ono Mahatma Gandhi Jews as a chosen people Bertrand Russell Anarchism Christian views of women History of feminism Holy Orders Fruits Basket Democracy Jennifer Lopez Iago Escape from New York Hillary Rodham Clinton Family Human Human position Marxist feminism Oppression Nikah Mut'ah Richard Allen (reverend) Scientology beliefs and practices Homemaker Non-aggression principle Grimke Sisters Mail-order bride Kitsch Theory of conduct Origin belief Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Affirmative action Shaggy dog story Peter Griffin Another World (TV series) Piccolo Junior Saga Knots Landing Arab-Israeli conflict Legal aspects of transsexualism Osama bin Laden Queer Friends The Pilgrim's Progress Israeli Arab Merit Norway national football team American individualist anarchism High-heeled shoe Plural marriage Islamic view of marriage Leviathan (book) Mojave people Anne Boleyn Rastafari movement Tony Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) The Handmaid's Tale Freeters Unemployment

has anyone changed the gender of their avatar gotten different reactions for the same ideas i did it once it was interesting i got a different type of insult degrading comments less about my assumed appearance more about my sexuality but overall i got insulted a bit less by the males they seemed to give me a bit more understanding about the same for the females but some did misinterpret things i said in a negative way rainbow perhaps i was just sharing my observations as objectively as i could jackal happy bullet i'm not certain your specific examples are entirely in the same category because people knew that it was still you guys well not sure if everone did but it was obvious to myself many others but thanks for your input anyhow i'm sure they still have some validity kendrick that's true someone bashing their own gender is not going to be taken very seriously i didn't actually have that in mind in my case i didn't bash anyone just pointed out the same types of things i usually do about both genders yes interesting you ask i am a woman i did not have an avatar at first so it defaulted to what appeared to be a mans pic also my nickname looks like keith but it isn't they are initials of names put together kelth people have mistaken me for a man and even asked me if i was one before recently i changed my avatar and some people still think it is a man pic because of the short hair sexist anyway when i asked men why they don't wear makeup and they thought i was a man they responded that i needed to go the gay section but when i asked them the same and clearly stated that i was a woman they all seemed to give me honest answers even more women are down right mean when it comes a women questioning them why they wear make up yet the ones that thought i was a man simply seemed confused  Gender-neutral language Gender role Sexual orientation Theory of conduct Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Social rule Infantilism Homosexuality and transgender Gay Transgender LGBT Philosophy of language Gender identity Biology and sexual orientation Homophobia Joke Plame affair Transsexuality Cultural relativism Ontological argument Socrates Same-sex marriage God Emperor of Dune Debugging Sex Scientology beliefs and practices One Tree Hill (TV series) Bisexuality God and gender Sexism Political correctness Gender Feminism Human sexual behavior Have I Got News For You Human Coercion Family name Sexual differentiation BASIC programming language Civil rights Goodness and value theory Internet troll Effeminacy Postmodernism Domestic violence Ethics Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Little Britain Falsifiability The nature of God in Western theology History of intersex surgery Slashdot trolling phenomena Meme Milton H.

why don't most feminists consider women's attitudes behaviors in the dating relationship arena applicable applicable to feminist theory it is disheartening to me to see women state that they think a woman can be into chasing bad boys and it doesn't impact her feminism to me that's like a chem dep counselor saying their current alcoholism doesn't impact their counseling what's up with this you're totally right in the dating world men are the ones who go out of their way for women asks her out picks her up from home pays for the dinner pays for the movie drives her back home this is chivalry something which most feminists claim to be against but at the same time they're ok with it being here that's why most people think that feminism means ''women who want equal rights yet want to have the benefits of being treated like a lady''  Feminism Domestic violence Feminist movement Civil rights Lesbian Sex-positive feminism History of women in the United States Masculism Fathers' rights Gender role Psychoanalysis Radical feminism Woman Psychology Germaine Greer Same-sex marriage Feminists for Life Homophobia Economic inequality Transfeminism Andrea Dworkin Psychotherapy Ethics Mail-order bride Women in Islam Transsexuality Little Britain History of feminism History of sex Marxist feminism Hillary Rodham Clinton Labor theory of value Theory of conduct Androgen insensitivity syndrome Orgasm Saved by the Bell Sexual orientation Marriage Sigmund Freud Friends Third-wave feminism Feminist theology Liberal feminism Jacobo Arenas History of intersex surgery Gender-neutral language Ideology Postmodernism Anne Boleyn Self-concept Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Equal Rights Amendment Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Divorce Sin City Prostitution Abortion debate American Psycho National Organization for Women Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Queer Butch and femme One Tree Hill (TV series) Social psychology Penis envy Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) Public domain Mothers Against Drunk Driving Same-sex marriage in Canada FairTax Health insurance Folic acid Women and Mormonism Catharine MacKinnon Religion and sexuality Second-wave feminism Priesthood (Mormonism) Blackjack Humphrey Bogart Probation officer Paternalism Wonder Woman Escape from New York Animal rights Katharine Hepburn Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Babe Ruth Beetle in an Anthill Life insurance Marriage counseling Sexual revolution Homosexuality and Christianity Rape Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Two Treatises of Government Christian views of women Lesbian feminism American individualist anarchism

domestic violence and women's rights to the people who claim that it is never acceptable for a man to hit a woman i have a few questions for you is it ever acceptable for a woman to hit a man if so why does it work for women only and not for men if a man should suffer the most severe consequences for hitting a woman should a woman who hits a man also suffer the same consequences if not why is it one way for women and another way for men keep in mind when answering that men and women are considered both by law and by social standards as equal if you suggest that men and women are not equal do you support and promote equality for women voting rights salary etc if so why the double standard for those whose answers are not applicable to the questions please spare me your opinions i have seen plenty of women who deliberately provoke and invite violence upon themselves and then act like victims when it happens a good friend told me once about a woman he was seeing who when they had even a minor tiff used to say things to him like why don't you hit me i know you want to hit me c'mon hit me then over and over and over until one day during a fight he found himself actually raising his hand to hit her he didn't follow through but he knew at that moment he had to end that sick relationship immediately and he did this was a man who would never hit any woman i knew him very well that story really got me thinking and i began to closely observe the sorry tales of women who were 'victims' of abuse many of them were not anything like as innocent as they claimed the same went for 'date rape stories many women put themselves in a position where they were vulnerable to an unscrupulous man some deliberately led the guy on and then tried to push him away the stories are legion the truly innocent victim is a relative rarity unfortunately and in entirely too many of the cases women had only themselves and their stupidity to blame it would be a much different world if women spent more time on the insides of their heads instead of the outside  Abortion debate Rape Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Child sexual abuse Divorce EastEnders Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Plame affair Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Utilitarianism Estoppel Theodicy Social rule Women in Islam Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Civil rights Feminism Federal Marriage Amendment Economic inequality Sin City Age of consent Infantilism Socrates Roe v.

why do you think some women are anti feminist i'm thinking of women like phyllis schalafly ann coulter and other conservative women who seem to want to undermine the advances of women or is it just a matter of them having the queen bee syndrome fyi the queen bee syndome is defined a case of a woman who may have gotten ahead by pulling herself up by the bootstraps and now doesn't see the need to help other women in fact the queen bee may go out of their way to hold other women back whom she feel may be competition in in a workplace or social situation isn't it funny that these women are telling other women to go back to the kitchen meanwhile they're making millions of dollars by writing books preparing speeches and working so they certainly don't practice what they preach part of me thinks they're just doing it for the another part of me thinks that they truly believe what they are saying but the fact that they don't apply it to themselves shows how what they're saying is apparently good in theory but not so good when it needs to be applied to real women  Ann Coulter Sex-positive feminism The Amber Spyglass Ethics Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Microeconomics Fathers' rights Friends Abortion debate Supply and demand Civil rights Humphrey Bogart Goodness and value theory Shaggy dog story The Subtle Knife Sexual revolution Gender role Masculism Biblical inerrancy Deconstruction Asperger syndrome The Death Gate Cycle Bee Gees Epistemology The Smoking Room Paula Jones Workplace democracy Anne Rice Political correctness Philosophical skepticism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an American Civil Liberties Union Phyllis Schlafly Undergrads Feminism Creation according to Genesis Knots Landing Economic inequality The Catcher in the Rye New Testament Queen bee Baron Munchhausen Transsexuality Extreme Programming Futurama (TV series - season 5) Free will Keynesian economics Productive and unproductive labour Bill O'Reilly (commentator) Priesthood (Mormonism) Inflation Barack Obama German student movement Truth Sleeping Beauty Blonde on Blonde Autism Germaine Greer Moral Politics Labor theory of value Bernard Williams Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Academy Award for Costume Design Japanese values The Shining (film) Chess strategy and tactics Transactional analysis Philosophical Investigations Democracy Kosher foods Feminists for Life Transformation problem Economics Multiculturalism Heir Apparent Honeybee Intelligent design Margaret Thatcher Avenue Q David Hume Russian joke Law of value Postmodernism Science Strategic management Surreal number Reality The nature of God in Western theology Scientology beliefs and practices Pat Buchanan Gender-neutral language Stuttering Barbra Streisand Dinesh D'Souza Dilbert Socrates

why do people get into a relationship i mean not every couple marriage is going to be perfect and longlasting but then again why are people getting into in a relationship or a marriage then just to have someone hang around them and make them feel good or important or sexy or have a sex buddy or what don't you think people take you dunno whats out there unless you try thing in dating too far like having the you keep trying dating until you find the one attitude won't that process actually cause a lot more hurt and pain and make things complicated look at the amount of divorces nowadays jeeze louize and its like dating and breaking up prepares us for that here are the findings of some scientific research on the subject suggesting that love gets us high 'the love drug' more than a feeling 'new research suggests love may be a drive as primal as thirst or hunger 'conducting research with lovesick college students poses some special challenges at least that's what arthur aron phd and his colleagues found while running a brain imaging study a few years ago his participants students who had recently fallen madly in love had no trouble with the first part of an experiment lying in a brain imaging machine gazing at their partners' pictures and thinking about the person they loved but when aron asked students to shift their attention to a picture of an acquaintance he ran into trouble they couldn't stop thinking about their partners says aron a social psychology professor at stony brook university after months of pilot testing aron lucy brown phd and helen fisher phd and their colleagues discovered that they could distract participants by showing them a randomly generated number and making them count backwards by sevens for several minutes only afterward could they think about their acquaintances one subject told us that having done that in the study helped her go to sleep at night aron says the great lengths the student had to go through to stop pondering her partner illustrates what a powerful force romantic love is says aron but contrary to popular opinion that force is not an emotion he contends rather it is a motivational state perhaps one as fundamental as hunger and thirst recent research by aron and others supports this theory for instance functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri studies show that dopamine rich areas of the brain light up when we think about a romantic partner those regions such as the ventral tegmental area vta are known as the motivation and reward system and appear to activate whenever people get something they deeply desire food water cocaine or perhaps a girlfriend's phone call some behavioral research as well as people's description of romantic love lends further support to the theory aron says for many people the experience of falling in love is like being in a desert and suddenly seeing water out there notes aron exquisite suffering a parched man in the desert may feel elated upon spotting an oasis but if the water turns out to be a mirage he'll experience an entirely different set of strong emotions notes lucy brown phd a neurology professor at the albert einstein college of medicine in new york the fact that love like thirst can lead to a wide variety of intense feelings suggests that it's closer to being a drive than an emotion in its own right she says people tend to think when you are in love you are happy but love can also mean feeling anxious angry sad says brown an as yet unpublished study by psychology graduate student bianca acevedo confirms brown's hunch acevedo in her fourth year at stony brook university gave students a list of emotion words such as affection jealousy and bliss she then gave them one of four target terms anger fear joy sadness or love and asked them to check off all the emotion words that related to their target term she found that people checked off about seven more list items when given the target term love than they did with the other targets what's more the students linked both positive and negative words to love whereas words like joy garnered only positive associations we believe this shows that love in general operates differently than emotions acevedo says those who think of love as an emotion may be misdirected by the fact that love can cause such strong emotions she notes some emotion researchers take issue with that stance gian gonzaga phd a psychologist and the senior research scientist at eharmony labs says that the flash of love the warmth and affection that you feel for just a few moments when you think about a lover is an emotion and like other emotions love has a distinct nonverbal display according to a study by gonzaga and his colleagues in emotion vol no pages the researchers videotaped couples while they reminisced about their first date during these exchanges participants tended to lean toward each other smile and gesture with open hands the researchers found in contrast to acevedo's findings the participants in gonzaga's study reported feeling a consistent set of positive emotions including high levels of happiness and arousal and low levels of discomfort and fear the conflicting results may come from the varying definitions of love used by different schools of researchers gonzaga notes there are a lot of theories of love and love across time gonzaga notes in some conceptions love isn't always a good thing it isn't always a happy thing drug like effects while there may be moments of placidity the larger experience of love is a mixed bag aron agrees in fact participants in aron's fmri study published in the journal of neurophysiology vol no pages reported a variety of different emotions as they gazed at their partners and their brains too showed a diverse array of activation patterns some participants who reported being happily in love even reacted to the photos with increased amygdala activity a response associated with fear and anxiety those fretful participants might have been worried about the possibility of losing their partners notes brown a study co author with love emotion is certainly involved and emotion areas of the brain are involved but it is going to be much more dependent on the individual's personality and attachment style she says while the participants in aron's study felt many different emotions when thinking of the person they loved they did have one thing in common they all showed activation in the vta the right posterodorsal body and the medial caudate nucleus these dopamine rich regions of the brain signal satiation of deep needs notes helen fisher phd an anthropology professor at rutgers all of the basic drives are associated with the dopamine system and so is romantic love fisher notes the increase in energy that people newly in love experience their ability to stay up all night talking may be due to a flush of dopamine fisher says dopamine system activation is also related to focused attention underpinning the feeling that one person is the new center of your world she says some of the same systems activated in people who are happily in love are also similar to those activated among people who have been recently rejected according to an as yet unpublished study by fisher and her colleagues they had lovelorn students lie in an fmri machine and look at pictures of their former partner or a familiar acquaintance as with the happily in love students the lovelorn showed increased activation in the motivation and reward systems when they thought about the person they loved unlike the

why are girls so competitive with eachother are guys the same way for instance im jealous of this girl i used to be friends with shes pretty shes has lots of money and a nice car she gets lots of attention to and i hate her now how do i get over this competition yeesh you said a mouthful it would be impossible to answer that whole thing here with just a simple paragraph but i can recommend a great book on the topic odd girl out by rachel simmons i'll summarize for the benefit of the question but there are really way too many contributing factors to express without reading a whole book dysmorphic body image and inappropriate personality roles are glorified in both popular media and by peers forced monogamy in society causes inappropriate competition for resources overt and covert messages that women are inferior to men and must therefore be subservient causes additional inappropriate competition collective mob mentality causes gang style behavior i am vulnerable and need the protection of others of my kind but then reinforces reactions where mob rule overcomes individualism getting over all of this is very tough because it requires a lot of introspection and there is pore likely to be more support for going along with the typical group mentality than just being yourself break free from what society has pigeonholed you to be and find people who are of the same mindset the good news is that for that other restrictions like age and race are unimportant someone who is wise can be from any walk of life surround yourself with intelligent open minded individuals and you'll go much further than running with the mob of mundanes  Sexual orientation Theory of conduct Microeconomics Psychology Asperger syndrome Autism Social psychology Human Human sexual behavior Internet troll Friends French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Transactional analysis Transsexuality Domestic violence Polygamy Anorexia nervosa Classified information Homophobia Monogamy Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Gender role Advertising Behaviorism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Race and intelligence Public good Gay rights Plame affair Marriage Alignment (role-playing games) A Course In Miracles Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Reparative therapy Azumanga Daioh Extreme Programming Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Consensus decision-making 3rd Rock from the Sun Bisexuality Stock character Borderline personality disorder Rape The Skeptical Environmentalist Simone Weil Fight Club Hikikomori Social rule Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Leadership Insurance Robert A.

a question for feminists why do feminist get so bent out of shape with other women just because we don't agree with you i like dominante men and i want a traditional marriage and most times i get told by other women how awful i am and how i'm hurting women everywhere i think that's really stupid because isn't the whole idea built around having choices so why is my choice so bad mike t you're too late i will throw my two cents in it has been my experience that feminist are pretty cool and they usually know what they want and work to get there you sound like one honestly take it as a complement radical feminism has nothing to do with choice it has everything to do with power a real man one who is dominant need not be abusive to the contrary he should protect love and cherish his wife also just because he wears the pants does not necessarily mean he should not ask for advice no one sees it all from all points your choice would be deemed bad because in terms of a political struggle for power that has nothing to do with relationship you add nothing to the cause radical feminism is like any group struggling for total control unpleasant to be around for all parties who disagree  Feminism Sex-positive feminism Marriage Domestic violence Anarchism History of women in the United States Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism American Conservatism Peter Griffin Gender-neutral language Fathers' rights Friends Evil Lesbian Episodes of Lost (Season 1) American individualist anarchism Polygamy Same-sex marriage Socialist Workers Party (UK) Andrea Dworkin Ethics Biology and sexual orientation Internet troll Jennifer Lopez Judaism The Handmaid's Tale The Apprentice 2 Joke Women in Islam The nature of God in Western theology Libertarian socialism Masculism Alcoholics Anonymous Avenue Q Sadism and masochism LaVeyan Satanism Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Philosophy of language Where Mathematics Comes From Plame affair Homosexuality and Christianity BDSM Incarnations of Immortality Civil rights Singlish Humphrey Bogart Fiddler on the Roof Masturbation Abortion debate Saved by the Bell Knots Landing Philip J.

why is it that you never hear about female pedophiles or sex offenders its just strange to me and when you think of pedophile you think of a bald fat hair old perverted man are there are female sex offenders i'm not crazy i was just wondering all this because i'm watching law and order svu right now it's rare but they're out there alright it's only been in recent years that these crimes that these women have committed are getting taken more seriously being reported to police more often and these criminals are being made to be just as accountable for their disgusting actions as the men who do it are and they are getting headlines just as the men are fictional tv shows just haven't caught up to the reality that these sick women are out there too i can imagine that will change as more of these cases are made known to the public some examples of highly publicized cases in the us and canada mary kay letourneu of washington state was a schoolteacher and a sex offender she not only seduced but also got herself pregnant twice by one of her grade school students she went to jail years for their crime and after she got out they got back together he's now an adult and they got married in some say it was a matter of them being born out of time humph i still say she corrupted him and abused her authority as a teacher in fact there have been news reports across the us canada the uk australia and other countries of female teachers who have been convicted of sexually abusing their underaged students just as there are male teachers who have gotten nailed for the same thing there's also been arguments that there is a double standard where women sex offenders don't get as harsh a punishment as male offenders one of the most disturbing cases of a female sex offender a women serial killer in canada named karla homolka she and her then husband paul bernardo were called the barbie and ken murderers their first victim was karla's own sister over the years the pair would systematically befriend teenage girls and then rape and or murder them she went to jail years in the rape and murder of three teenage girls i think probably because this happened in canada it didn't make much news in the us i remember back in the early s there was a year old woman in my neighborhood a large midwestern city whose kids i used to babysit for she got sent off to what they called a hospital for the criminally insane because she got romantically and sexually involved with a year old at that time most people in the neighborhood blew it off as a rite of passage for the boy and truth be told he did have a crush and was pretty openly obsessed with her buying her gifts bringing her flowers etc but his parents didn't see it that way and so they prosecuted under the statutory rape law but the case was kept real quiet not even a mention in the papers i only knew about it because my mother told me why i wouldn't be babysitting for her anymore i heard that the boy ran away from home trying to look for her didn't hear any more after that about what happened to either one of them  Serial killer EastEnders Pedophilia Rape Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Murder Domestic violence Days of our Lives Humphrey Bogart Polygamy Prostitution 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Child pornography Marriage North American Man/Boy Love Association Leo Frank Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Statutory rape Law & Order: Special Victims Unit Child sexual abuse Prisoner (TV series) Law & Order Great Teacher Onizuka Satanic ritual abuse Knots Landing Boston Public Paul Bernardo Sharon Tate Pornography Theory of conduct Plame affair Miscarriage of justice Childlove movement Mary Kay Letourneau Marc Dutroux Zoophilia Appeal Little Britain Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Sexual abuse Hip hop rivalries The Fairly OddParents The Marshall Mathers LP One Tree Hill (TV series) Lex Luthor Pornography in Japan The Lovely Bones Infantilism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Crime Jam (TV series) Friends The Catcher in the Rye Katelyn Faber Spanking Incest Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sathya Sai Baba Lawrence v.

is the princess syndrome a major road block in feminism from reading a lot of answers i'm starting to think one problem with feminism and men who hate feminism is the tendency to generalize we all do it feminist assume anti feminist men hate women and men assume all independent women are feminists but i think the princess syndrome is a major reason for this women who believe in the whole women first mentality these princesses while not necessarily being feminist still manage to enjoy the rewards of feminism and these are the women who make feminism look bad as well they are the ones who follow the double standard and expect equality while also expecting special treatment for being female its especially hard for men today because every woman out there has their own little idea of how a man should treat a woman and if he gets it wrong he is attacked there is really no rule anymore and thats why a lot of men are very frustrated agree yes it has got a lot to answer for all the confusion that this princess behavior causes i really feel for men theses days dammed if they do no wonder we find it so hard to get on it seems women have their own agenda these days and try to fit men around it accordingly men heres a tip avoid all women who insist on be called princess  Gender role Feminism God and gender History of intersex surgery Sex-positive feminism Sigmund Freud Gender-neutral language Asperger syndrome Fathers' rights Adult attention-deficit disorder Ethics Transgender Procrastination Theory of conduct Fight Club Androgen insensitivity syndrome Domestic violence Homosexuality and transgender Sadism and masochism Sexual orientation Contract Social rule Feminist movement The Apprentice 2 History of feminism Homophobia Civil rights Eugenics Cancer Liberalism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Intersex surgery Dissociative identity disorder Animal rights Women in Islam John Money Little Britain Cult Hikikomori Orgasm Abortion Volleyball Masculism Autism Lesbian Transfeminism Stomach cancer Susan McClary Misogyny The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Addiction Religion and sexuality Anti-Mormonism Poker jargon Church of Christ Philosophy of language Democracy Goodness and value theory Biology and sexual orientation Mary Wollstonecraft Andrea Dworkin Same-sex marriage Media and ethnicity Bipolar disorder Avenue Q Anarchism Infantilism Internet troll Strap-on dildo The Contender (television series) Clinical depression Traumatic brain injury Mojave people Free will Lisp programming language Human sexual behavior Gender studies Gaze Germaine Greer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Discordianism Borderline personality disorder Mathematician Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Heteronormativity Penis envy Anorexia nervosa Friedrich Nietzsche Arthur Schopenhauer Leadership Seneca Falls Convention Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism High-heeled shoe Plame affair Radical feminism American individualist anarchism Religion and sexual orientation

who has the more sexy torso male or female both just so happened to be fit it's really hard to compare the two i don t know how u can since it s like comparing apples to oranges i mean women have nice boobs but i a man in decent shape will have pecs bot midsections if in decent shape would look good but even if a man doesn t have a build thus not a chest he could still have nice toned arms that a good amount of guys naturally seem to have whereas i see the beauty in the whole female form but the arms are not really a sexual part to me and i think that 's true for most men but the boos obviously are and the midsection also and the hips and the small of her back and that curve but a man's toned arms seems to be one of the sexy of sexual parts for women to see and that is becauase man having the muscles and muscle tone and i mean bot forms have different features that are sexy i wold think and some which both of the same parts can both be sexy i think it all depends on how one looks at it but i don't u can really compare i mean afterall if one is fancying the man's muscles and tone compared to the female form that the person is mor admiring non sexually then i would think that should imply the sexier form to that person and usually that goes with the sexual orientation and the same goes for fancying the female form and admiring non sexually the male form oh i just read the fit part well then the male form if fit wold have a flat hard stomach or abs and pecs and sculpted shoulders and cut arms and proabablyh muscular back and the female form would have nice slender arms shoulders nice flat stomach nice firm but soft breasts so yin and yang pretty much soft curves vs chiseled features obvioulsly to me it would be the female form since i am a man but i can actually look at things objectively so in the objective stance none is better than the other  Equine conformation Sexual attraction Weight training Physical attractiveness Aerial (dance move) Tai Chi Chuan Sexual differentiation Wood carving Puberty Professional wrestling throws Tightlacing Massage Human position Professional wrestling holds Wing Chun Terminal ballistics Gender role Abdomen Piledriver (professional wrestling) Sexual dimorphism Humphrey Bogart Swimming Sexual orientation Drill bit Undergarment Orgasm Human height Sex toy Breaststroke Drawing Human anatomy Time Out of Mind Microeconomics Elbow bondage Naruto jutsu Archery Madonna (entertainer) Rococo Autopsy Professional wrestling attacks Dog Secondary sex characteristic Hangul Knife Aikido Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Buttocks Sex Nudity Theory of conduct Mr. Olympia Gender Team Fortress Classic Diving Androgen insensitivity syndrome Condom Transgender Gay slang Sexual revolution The Ashlee Simpson Show Woodworking Biology and sexual orientation Economic inequality Human sexual response cycle Breech birth Hair Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Usher (entertainer) Humerus Swingout Reservoir Dogs Dualism (philosophy of mind) Supply and demand Body image The Smoking Room Volleyball Professional wrestling aerial techniques Scoliosis Social rule Shoulder Suplex Dragon Booster Transsexuality Glossary of ballet terms Discordianism Hentai Xiaolin Showdown Internal oblique Urinary incontinence Doom enemies Sex organ Anal sex Sundial Harem anime Male prostitute

what responsibility do businesses have for pregnant employees why should pregnant workers expect businesses to pay for special benefits open only to them should not all workers be treated equally why do feminists feel that pregnant women should be treated better than a person who is temporarily disabled for example i have read that here that some feminists feel that businesses should provide pregnant workers special benefits such as weeks of paid leave and should disregard the fact that the worker was absent when considering the group for raises promotions and bonuses based on performance why should businesses be expected to give this consideration only to pregnant women and not all workers i will provide paid parental leave only when i can also afford to provide an equally long periodic sabbatical for childless or those with adult children workers draecoiram help me understand if new mother or father did not contribute to a major successful project because of parental leave are you saying that a worker who made zero contribution should be given the same bonus as the one who made a significant contribution i submit that that would be completely unequal and unfair to the contributors and would create legal exposure where small contributors could claim they were discriminated against baba yaga yes i'm the boss when you've learned enough to make a few years of payroll come back and we'll talk in fact sit down let me teach you something very basic fmla allows for weeks of unpaid leave for anyone who needs it it does not discriminate for or against anyone fmla is not just for parents it's for any medical situation including caring for aged parents a sick child or a spouse dog owner confused as to what you are saying are you saying that any benefits pregnant women get should be made available to all workers if i understand you that is what i am saying i am not comfortable giving worker a weeks of paid leave because she chose to get pregnant she can take it unpaid via fmla now without allowing worker b to take weeks of paid leave at some point that is discriminatory in my opinion it will be about years before i can afford to provide the benefit for everyone i will not do it for some and not for all dog owner start a business where you have to figure out how to pay for the expensive benefits and salaries you demand and then see if you feel the same way about companies cheating their employees carrie i do provide st lt disability at no cost to the employee i do fmla paying workers for a year who don't work is financially untenable ouch i recommend that everyone who complains that companies don't spend enough money providing benefits start their own business with months of parental leave and hire only married women in their childbearing years as possible anise don't you realize that working class parents have been raising kids for decades by saving budgeting working together as families and taking responsibility for their choice to have children why is it that people feel that businesses are reservoirs of unlimited cash that they they entitled to until you have to open your own checkbook you will not understand what you are really asking for object of it's ire how can european companies do it it is their governments who are doing it with far higher taxes than the us well over in some cases that is also why us companies sell more american products in europe than vice versa secondly have you ever opened your business checkbook to pay any employees and provide these benefits why don't you put 'your money where your mouth is ' once you do that then come back and piously tell me state what companies should do thirdly once i can afford it i do intend to offer paid parental leave however i will not discriminate against persons who chose not to have children i will offer them a sabbatical after several years of employment at the same length of the parental leave lastly i started saving for retirement when it was over years away i do not intend to rely on the kindness of strangers when i'm old carrie i pay for performance taking everything into consideration the more profit the company makes the more money there is for benefits i incent employees to maximize profits which ultimately benefit them i am not trying to get rich just trying to build something solid and stable that my family benefits from and my employees benefit from steve i think too many of the people above are too sensitive about what you re asking you run a fine business and provide all the allowable benefits under the law as i understand your question you re just asking how can other countries businesses afford to provide paid benefits to its employees who take time off be it for pregnancy sick family members etc i wonder if their government assists in subsidizing the salaries of these workers taking time off in america it would be difficult to give anyone paid time off over and above their vacation and holiday paid time off i think the fmla is well written in that it only gives unpaid time off eases the burden on the employer to anyone who needs it for pregnancy or sick family members the government does not subsidize anything for employers in america therefore you cannot make a living paying people for not working i m sorry people but to pay someone for time off regardless of their condition would be to pay two people for the same job the business would go under if they did this  Publicly funded medicine Abortion in the United States Compensation of employees Abortion

what do women do for men i have a curious question for all the women here what have you done in the last week to help a man or what nice thing have you done for a man note not a boyfriend husband or father what have you done for a man who is not serving you in some way strangers notice i didn't say male friend you haven't even done anything for guys who are supposed to be your friends also read what lycraspandex said very good point also read hemiboy good point wrensnest i seriously doubt you are doing all that just to be nice there is more to that story trust me great question a lot of women walk around thinking men owe them something i'll be standing in line and self serving women who are at least somewhat attractive will cut in front of me slyly like i'm supposed to bow down to her because she's a woman sometimes i say something but i normally don't say anything i just let the woman live in her bubble of selfiousness and misandry or i'll be walking down an aisle and women white women especially will just walk and cross my path like i'm not even there like i'm invisible to her i have to stop abruptly to avoid a collision which would then be blamed on me since i'm the man and it's not like she doesn't see me walking she just views me as some nobody that's in her way and that i should stop for her like she's a princess walking down a red carpet women think men that don't even know them are supposed to bend over backwards and treat her like a princess many women in the us and many western countries suffer from a condition known as the princess complex how many women will get mad at me now that i've told the truth zikiru instead of sidestepping the question by reflecting back the same question to him how about addressing the issue secondly saying that you have a job where you have to help people speaks volumes i believe mike t was speaking about women that do favors and help men out of the goodness of their heart like men routinely do for women not because their employer gives them a paycheck random you totally missed the point he didn't say anything about serving men he was referring to doing courteous favors for a man or helping him out when he needs a helping hand this is something men usually do for women do you do anything helpful for men  Little Britain Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule 2000 Australian Grand Prix Paul Is Dead Mojave people The Inside RuneScape quests EastEnders Fight Club Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Plame affair Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Past teachings of Prem Rawat Sydney Riot of 1879 The Apprentice 2 The Lovely Bones Scouting Reservoir Dogs Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Kodocha Hillary Rodham Clinton Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The Invisibles Teen Girl Squad The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Subtle Knife Knots Landing Spidey Super Stories The Shining (film) Have I Got News For You Volleyball Oral sex Sharon Tate Sin City The Time Machine Milton H.

why do women continue to act like they're the ones that have to look perfect to be considered attractive there is absolutely no doubt that women have it easy compared to men all kind of women of all ages are considered attractive by men the percentages of women most men find attractive are really high compared to the percentages of men women find attractive if you don't believe me look my questions about this and who do you think should be more worried about aging women in their s and s are considered very attractive even by guys in their teens and s you're always hearing about guys fantasizing about their teachers and theirs friends' moms girls in their teens and early s never look at guys over and women in general find more guys under sexy than guys over women only think they have to look like supermodels to be attractive the truth is guys have different preferences and even the average and below average girls are considered hot by a lot of guys a woman's idea of an unconventionally attractive guy she finds hot is a cute guy rather than a handsome guy or a guy with cool hair rather than a guy with a sexy body most guys are not considered attractive by any women while most women are considered attractive by guys correction d d when we men get older we don't start looking at younger girls i'm and i'm already almost as interested in older women late s and s than girls my age most men find women in their s much sexier than teen girls it is you women who only want attention from guys in their teens and early s and find most guys over to be ugly and yes despite the fact the you grow much faster then men there are plenty of guys in their teeens and s who find women over really sexy yet there is almost no girls in their teens and s who find guys over sexy it's becoming a media phenomena that is spiraling out of control imo the advertisements products tv internet mag's and culture have us women chasing our tails on being en vogue not only does it have us chasing our tails but we're so preoccupied by it that we forget to look at men so men then become complacent with their appearance because they don't get told that's not working for you by anyone so they are fashion disasters this works for the young men but becomes problematic and disasterious for the older man who's lost track of time even the man who's married and settled finds himself over weight out of fashion and socially unacceptable some wives will make efforts to fix him while other wives find it comforting to secure their men with this bad fashion to divert adultry with this later strategy the woman's often letting her spouses health go for security in turn this can also backfire by allowing her to get sloppy too then this spirals into two people with little or no fashion sense trying to get out of their rut  Social rule Sexual attraction Friends Sexual orientation Physical attractiveness Humphrey Bogart Human height Transsexuality Marilyn Monroe Teen Girl Squad Undergarment Avenue Q Pedophilia Gender role Stewie Griffin Madonna (entertainer) Internet phenomenon Age disparity in sexual relationships Marriage Adolescence Milton H.

why do many amerian women forget that equal rights should come with equal responsibilities for years i have heard many of women complain that american men are sexist when they dont believe in paying them equal promoting them or treating with equal respect yet many of these women fail to acknowledge that there are areas where men are more lenient on women or even make excuses to justifywhy treating women better than men is not discrimination one example of that is selective service another issue is the criminal justice system if a woman like debra lafave sleeps with an underage boy we are willing to take any excuse as to why she did what she did however we wuld not do the same for a male the same can be said about capital punishment many states such as texas virginia and others who hand out the death penalty quickly for male murderes are very rare to hand down a death sentence for a woman under the same circumstances with regard to selective service the stance i take is that it should be all together abolished neither draft for men or women but that ties more to my political beliefs than gender relations i agree with you that the criminal justice system is jaded however it's interesting to note that those cases are in fact capitol trials but the punishment determined by the jury is almost always more lenient on women to me this shows that it is not necessarily the system itself that is sexist but society in general that still sees women as the weaker sex and more evidence of the patriarchy techinically this would go for number one too as the politicians responsible for selective service are elected to office by the general population many modern women today are in fact benevolent sexists google it and many men whether equal minded or not still view women as the weaker sex deserving of special treatment any feminist worth her salt fights against this recognizing that it is a sexist society with leftovers from the patriarchy and further recognizes how much feminism is still necessary as it is the only gender rights group politically powerful enough to do something about these inequalities  Feminism Masculism Gender role Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sexism Fathers' rights Civil rights Gender-neutral language Abortion debate Gay rights Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Affirmative action Jury trial Homophobia Economic inequality Unlawful combatant Appeal Domestic violence Democracy Fathers' rights movement in the UK Equal Protection Clause Rape Radical feminism Capital punishment in the United States Homosexuality and Christianity Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution Patriarchy Penis envy Liberalism Athenian democracy Same-sex marriage Woman Heteronormativity Roper v.

reproductive rights and the battle of the sexes many argue that reproductive rights are swayed in favor of women when it boils down the fact is that numerically women have more choices then men in case of preg obviously both have the option of contraception prior to fertilization but post conception men have none and women still have options such as abortion men's rights activists argue that this uneven choice has impeded men in that while one party has the final decision both parties must accept the outcome should the woman choose to carry the pregnancy full term she makes the decision for not only her to become a parent financially and otherwise but also the man should she choose to abort the fetus the man is chosen out of parenthood should equal rights efforts address biological matters and why what would be some possible solutions for this unevenness both in the event of full term pregnancy and abortion to even the playing field for men or should it be even pros cons of solutions as you point out prior to pregnancy both men and woman have equal choice as to engage or refrain from sex and the right to practice contraception after pregnancy occurs the current idea of reproduction seems to boil down to one thing her body her choice his responsibility logically if only one person has a choice about any matter the whole responsibility for that choice should fall solely on the shoulders of the only person who has the choice if the choices are shared equally by one or more each person having equal choice should share equal responsibility men have no choice once pregnancy is established while women have several options abortion adopting the child out legal abandonment or keeping the child and demanding payment from the father although to adopt the baby out the pregnancy and birth must be hidden from the father in most cases single mothers are automatically considered as a parent with all rights of a parent while single fathers are not unless the mother approves married mothers are considered the primary parent even when the father does more of the hands on care in cases of divorce and custody battles if men have any responsibility in regard to reproduction they must also be given choices in the matter relative to the amount of responsibility as it is men are given the amount of responsibility the mother chooses without any choice whatsoever solutions end abortion on demand and legislate equal responsibility for the pregnancy birth and cost of children in addition to equality in parenthood regardless the sex of the parent legislate the ability for fathers to deny parenthood legally paper or legal abortion to equal that of mothers to deny it physically actual abortion this would result in mothers still having the other choices abortion adoption abandonment or keeping it but also require they accept the sole responsibility for their sole choice this would require the man s decision to be made prior to the cutoff for abortion in either case all parents should share equal rights and responsibilities in regard to born children  Pro-choice Adoption Roe v.

do feminists in general despise men in general i'm getting that from reading posts on this forum yes some of you are actually nice sweet women but every time a feminist posts something it reads as belittling us men what the hell not in general but it's very common including among some who claim not to some of the answers in this forum have pretty clearly demonstrated this hatred of men is largely considered acceptable within feminism many feminists do not find hatred of men at at all offensive as they do hatred of women homosexuals ethnic minorities or even cruelty to animals in some cases hatred of men is tolerated and understood by many feminists for reasons that they feel are justified i personally feel that there is no just reason to hate persons whom one has never met tolerance of hatred of males makes the believability of the feminist equality between men and women argument a difficult one for the general populace to believe  Hate speech Sexual orientation Feminism Same-sex marriage Fathers' rights Feminist movement Gender-neutral language Gender role Homosexuality and Christianity Civil rights God and gender Freedom of speech Religion Aesthetic Realism Internet troll Masculism Bernard Williams Iago Feminists for Life Homosexuality Infantilism Evil Transgender Nancy Witcher Astor Church of Christ Theory of conduct Transsexuality Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Pedophilia Reparative therapy Child sexual abuse Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Homosexuality and transgender Sexism Christianity and anti-Semitism Racism Religion and sexuality Conscription Socrates Criticisms of Christianity Mary Wollstonecraft Anne Boleyn Gay rights Epistemology Hate crime Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Marriage Ethics Animal rights Asian fetish Democracy Utilitarianism Gender Jews as a chosen people Religion and sexual orientation Peter Singer Ranma __ characters Serial killer Fictional character Lawrence v.

do girls judge their friends' boyfriends as much as guys judge their friends' girlfriends i feel like a lot of guys at least younger ones will date pretty girls who they don't get along very well with simply because they are afraid of what their friends would think if they dated a plain girl based on her personality and they are afraid of how she will reflect on them i was wondering if girls have similar feelings of doubt in that situation are they paranoid about dating a guy who isn't exceptionally good looking because they're afraid of what their friends will say also will girls typically lie and say they liked a friend's boyfriend even if they weren't a fan just an fyi by younger i meant under yes women care about how they are perceived among their friends just like men are when i was younger and had lower self esteem i started liking this guy who wasn't the cutest i never brought him out in public because i was afraid of losing status among my peers even though i was really into him i think women feel more pressure than men in some cases just think about how much we do things to show off to other women you won't see this with a woman who is confident though because she has chosen friends who are of substance and as confident as her so they will see what she sees in the guy too depends on the friendship unless i have valid reasons for disliking a guy my friend is dating disrespectful etc i respect her personal decision and accept the guy without questioning anything after all she's the one dating him not me  Social rule Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Transsexuality Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) Ranma __ characters Kodocha George Costanza About a Boy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Smoking Room Megan Griffin Kim Possible Big Brother (USA TV series) Religious Society of Friends Avenue Q Sex and the City Cliff Richard Otaku Infantilism EastEnders Mary Jane Watson Knots Landing Theodicy Friendship Pok__mon Live!

does anyone feel like the sentiment that if a woman isn't a piece of 'azz' she's not worth zero still in our society it's not so apparent as it may have been years ago but i remember especially growing up and in high school that idea was still there if a woman is beautiful and intelligent she has so much going for her if a woman is ugly and intelligent she's only worth so much even other woman have this over sexed ideas even beautiful woman who complain about it they all try don't they sometimes i wish i was invisible or that i could disquise myself as a man so that i could be human and it's so frustrating because it's not so blantantly obvious anymore is it sometimes i'd rather be dead than be a woman these days sorry i'm drunk my self esteem isn't usually so bad i agree with you to a point i think it's fairly obvious that women do face more pressure to be pretty than men do i do not think that her looks are the defining factor to her success in the business world but i do think being good looking will help you regardless of your sex i've read a few conflicting studies about this when it comes to dating if i'm talking to a girl good looking or not and she is confident funny smart and kind i would be interested in her i don't consider myself to be exceptionally good looking i don't consider myself to be exceptionally ugly theres a link in my profile to my if you're curious to see me but i have dated girls on both ends of the spectrum i realize that i am not like most guys but at the same time it does show you that there are guys like this many girls claim that they only look to the inside when it comes to guys yet they get upset when some jerk isn't into them because of their looks if that's the case then how are you into him to start with he clearly does not have the personality you're claiming to be attracted to so what does it matter anyway i hope ya cheer up everyone is worth something and if you are confident kind and smart you'll have much more success in every aspect of your life  Theory of conduct Social rule Humphrey Bogart About a Boy Gender role The Amber Spyglass Kodocha The Fairly OddParents Undergrads Transsexuality Goodness and value theory Human sexual behavior Episodes of Lost (Season 1) George Costanza Sexual orientation Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Asperger syndrome Plame affair The Catcher in the Rye Pok__mon Live!

so what's it like at a women's shelter i'm thinking about going to one but i wanna know first hand what is it like there and what are the benefits of going there will they teach you how to drive so you can get your license and be on your own tell me other stuff you know about women shelters and thanks do they take women who are emotionally abused and controlled i hate to be the bearer of bad news but no most shelters won't take women who are only emotionally abused in fact i have yet to see one where this is the case shelters are in place to protect the safety of the abused victim not give her a place to crash till she gets on her feet i do not mean to imply that your experience is not in fact abusive but unless you are physically threatened you would be better off just ending the relationship with the support of your friends and family members the women who are physically in danger are the ones who need those extra beds in shelters on a side note it should also be mentioned that most shelters because of lack of funding are turning away solitary women in favor of women with children the shelter holds women with children in priority because of the increased number of potential victims rare is the shelter now a days that will open its doors to a childless woman though if you call a few hotlines you might be able to find one again if your abusive situation is terms for plausable physical danger if your situation is not physically abusive and you just need support right now hang on to your friends and family members call those same hotlines and ask about emotional abuse support groups read self help books get into therapy and get to know you i'm currently going through the transition from emotionally abusive relationship to singlehood too so if you need someone else to talk to about this who understands feel free to e mail me sorry if what i said about the type of abuse came off as harsh i just know how badly every single bed at a shelter is needed and that it should go to the people who really need it the most if you are in physical danger then that means you take care and good luck  Domestic violence Spanking Infantilism Transsexuality Child sexual abuse Rape Reparative therapy Polygamy Traumatic brain injury False memory Alcoholics Anonymous Divorce About a Boy Fathers' rights Stroke Borderline personality disorder Child abuse Narcissism Cult Human sexual behavior Homophobia Social rule Happiness Serial killer American Red Cross Boston Public Zoophilia Polyamory Anger management Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal A Course In Miracles Gratitude Torture Dog Anxiety Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Drama Child sexuality Nicomachean Ethics Asperger syndrome Opposition to cults and new religious movements Carl Jung Hate group Childlove movement Chernobyl accident Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Glen Jacobs Emotions (album) Motivation Emotion Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Involuntary commitment The Empty Child Sin City Prostate cancer Clinical depression Sigmund Freud Autism Past teachings of Prem Rawat Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Psychoanalysis Dead Like Me Homelessness Childbirth Children of God CPU cache Strap-on dildo Grief Post-traumatic stress disorder Numerology Road safety Men's rights Sant Thakar Singh Bipolar disorder Domination & submission (BDSM) Drug abuse Dissociative identity disorder Amnesty International Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Friends of the Western Buddhist Order First aid Scientology beliefs and practices Anorexia nervosa Theodicy Theory of conduct Sheryl Crow Clomipramine Deprogramming

why must guys just sometimes hang out with guys my husband has a friend named mark my husband mark and myself have hung out on numerous occaions all three of us get along very well and are pretty good friends i'm a tom boy so guy friends are more my cup of tea and i usually get along with guys better as well i wheel fish hike watch football and drink beer not to many women want to do those things with me anyway well mark is always talking about how he just wants him and my husband to go four wheelin sometime like a guys day or something i guess it kinda hurts my feelings that would be the girl in me right there so my question is why must guys do guy only things sometimes it really frustrates me and i think it's stupid baba yaga just because i haven't many female friends speaks ill of me how about the fact that i have very few friends at all male or female it has everything to do with being a tom boy i'm interested in things males are mostly interested in and not interested in things that females are usually interested in so i tend to hang out with people that do things i'm interested in simple math really i didn't need your psycho babble today thanks anyway jim baw it's mark that wants the guys day not my husband he's mature enough and couldn't care less about a guys day out it's not stupid but a mental block we can't change hardened attitudes formed over decades even if we wish to then there are social norms which some times take more than a generation to just get modified leave aside the total change the answer for you is that guy and guy things shall continue but increased participation by people like you shall help in modifying attitudes your kids would face lesser resistance when they reach your age  Kyle Broflovski Humphrey Bogart Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Singlish Boston Public Kodocha About a Boy Laura Schlessinger EastEnders American Psycho Milton H.

how many here have chosen to remain celibate and why in this context celibacy refers to a vow of singlehood not chastity trip it's normal for people who choose it if you're not into it that's your prerogative but don't insult people who are into it by playing the normalcy card alex c tell your friend i laughed i can't say i've taken a vow to be single but i've been avoiding the marriage virus for quite some time more people really should choose singlehood for awhile too many marriages end in divorce why my guess is people are afraid of being alone and pick the nearest warm body as a spouse instead of taking their time to find a suitable spouse  Clerical celibacy Sexual abstinence Grief Holy Orders Roman Catholic Church Marriage Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Divorce Christian view of marriage Homosexuality and Christianity EastEnders Wheel of Fortune Nun Same-sex marriage Same-sex marriage in Canada Common-law marriage Polyamory Polygamy Joker (comics) Computer virus Monk British monarchy The Adventures of Pete & Pete Draw poker Religious aspects of marriage Virgin Virtual Realm Family Infantilism Human sexual behavior Eastern Orthodox Church Audrey Hepburn One Piece minor characters Christian monasticism Poker jargon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wedding ring Pope John Paul II Alimony President (game) Women in Islam No-fault divorce Annulment Rights and responsibilities of marriages in the United States Game show Mojave people Anne Boleyn Funeral Monasticism Piccolo Junior Saga Winning Streak Leonard Feeney Kender Martin Luther Royal family Friends The Newlywed Game Ma malakat aymanukum Religious conversion Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Masturbation Rich Mullins Domestic violence Deus Ex: Invisible War Hiberno-English Mail-order bride Whose Line Is It Anyway?

pretending the cultural belief system doesn't exist despite the evidence igorance by design or misogyny the cultural gender belief system has influenced the ways in which difference and sameness has been studied in men and women early researchers conceptualizations of masculinity femininity conformed to a bipolar view the more contemporary plethora of research on masculinity femininity and expressivity instrumentality has created a body of knowledge that accepts these as coherent and measurable constructs there are many definitions and instruments developed to measure them the bem sex role inventory bem are used to assess the degree to which men and women have internalized the gender stereotypic personality traits of agency instrumentality i e male stereotypic traits and communion expressivity i e female stereotypic traits engaging in gender typed behaviors is assessed using the sex role behavior scale srbs orlofsky and its short form companion orlofsky o heron con't from above the degree to which people have adopted traditional versus contemporary or liberal views about men women and the relationships between men and women is assessed using measures such as the attitudes toward women scale spence helmreich and the male role norms scale thomp son pleck thompson pleck fer rera other frequently used measures of gender role socialization include the gender role conflict scale grcs o neil helms gable david wrightsman the masculine gender role stress scale eisler skidmore and the feminine gender role stress scale gillespie eisler see beere for more examples of how gender role socialization can be measured i posted a question about traditional masculinity at http answers yahoo com question index ylt auifhflb huhy hldpkbbsy ix qid aapdnzo lo and behold i am attacked with this 'feminist science' that men are bad using assumptions is why men say that 'hatred towards men' is what feminism is about quit wasting our time with man hating assumptions how can there be any effective communication between the genders if so many people refuse to look at the body of scientific evidence they pretend it doesn t even exist what causes this ignorance by design i can't beleeeeeve this references both are scholarly articles originally published in refereed scientific journals http counselingoutfitters com rees htm http www menshealth org code pmm a pdf uh ya the american psychological association ain't a good enough source for ya men who display high hostility and strong conformity to masculine gender roles what the literature calls gender role conflict grc may cause distress to others particularly their wives hostility appears to be positively correlated with strong conformity to masculine gender roles you don't like the research results you wanna make it up yourself or what guess the entire american psychological association are 'man hating' how can this be i think i understand you guys don't want to look too closely you are afraid of what you will see it all makes sense now lol it's probably been done you can search the internet as i did the fact that you state that hostility toward women low self esteem anxiety depression homophobia fear of intimacy are masculine traits makes you a man hating sexist or the people doing the study you can hate men and blame them for your failures all you want though here is is lifted from the apa site verbatim men who display high hostility and strong conformity to masculine gender roles what the literature calls gender role conflict grc may cause distress to others particularly their wives a recent study indicates past research on men suggests such conformity limits their emotional lives and has linked high grc with lower self esteem increased anxiety and depression hostility toward women fear of intimacy homophobia and reluctance to seek help men displaying hostility in the videotaped discussions scored high in grc in their own and their wives' ratings and wives with the most marital dissatisfaction and depression rated their husbands con't from above highest on grc measures of restrictive emotionality power success competition and restrictive affectionate behavior between men men low in grc were less hostile during marital interactions and their wives were less depressed and more satisfied with the marriage indicating that men who have the courage to resist traditional masculinity are likely benefiting themselves and their spouse yes that's fine too they collect and disseminate information amongst other things the fact that is is published on their site means they stand behind it manbeast and kendrick its perceptions of masculinity not the actual being male its the same dangerous cycle of gender expectations that feminism has been dismantling for women no one in these studies says that being male hostile and evil it is equating things that are traditionally associated with masculinity like hostility to divorce rates it does not say anywhere that men are naturally hostile in fact one of the researchers cited bem is forefront in identifying gender role expectations and deconstructing them your reactions to this question are just proof of how much you have accepted these fairly arbitrary gender expectations and assume them to be natural you have proven the point instead of refuting it congrats edit kendrick what part of associated with masculinity are you not getting read sandra bem's work on gender role expectations before you start mouthing off about what the research means i do not deny that women can be hostile but women are not expected to be hostile if they fit into the traditional concept of femininity i wouldn't be offended if you said that the concept of femininity had been associated with mental inferiority because it is the traditional concept of femininity assumes inferiority to males thats half of my argument you sound quite intelligent but i get the feeling that something here isn't quite making sense to you concepts of masculinity male concepts of femininity female therefore don't take this all so personal and try reading the studies before assuming that the entire apa is misandrist and the communication training came with a year college degree i mentioned the intercultural communication training because thats where i encountered sandra bem and her research  Mathematics Hypnosis Psychometrics Modernism Feminist movement Tonality Meme Plame affair

have i made a fair assessment of this situation i had a situation with this girl at work where i sent her seven unanswered emails over a four month span though there was nothing in the emails threatening sexual or asking for dates they frightened her understandable with my sarcastic tone which doesn't come across well in writing i did the most wrong and have felt nothing but crippling guilt for the past two years for scaring her she did some things wrong herself which i consider understandable when taking into account her fear a fear which i feel was unfounded but still i ended up getting written up by my job and have felt like a hopeless stalker over the past couple years and i am a stalker on some levels but not to an insane degree i don't actually follow this woman it's closer to infactuation but was in danger of rising to full blown stalker but now i am working on avoiding her at work and niether demonizing her nor propping her up as a some goddess i probably should get some help but i don't like that type of thing have i taken a fair assessment of the situation or is waswisgirl right and i am in some type of denial and a terrible stalker i discuss the situation in detail in the following resolved questions below i'd hate to crowd this yahoo answers with my problems but this is my only way to vent http answers yahoo com question index ylt ap foadrw ibuc ft fh vty ix qid aaqs kr tzimmer you say dude youve crossed the line in so many wrong ways and your still crossing the line by asking again i'm well aware i've crossed the line with her before but i'm not quite sure how asking this question is crossing a line either it's better to air this stuff out in some way rather than to just bottle it up if i talk to people i know about this all they do is bash the girl and dismiss her as some freak not productive get a grip and let this go like i say i consider this a healthy venting of sorts any letting go may be nothing more than disguised unhealthy suppression plus it a gym right get another job that one aint that great anyway do you work there plus maybe your setting your sites too high aim a little lower in the looks department not really meaning to be mean but like i said you crossed the line so once i've crossed a certain line that means i have to date women i'm not attracted to brilliant logic listen bob it sucks when you find out the person you like doesn't like you back then when that person reports you as a stalker its gotta be devastating i understand you're hurting my advise move on find someone who likes you back and forget about this girl stay absolutely clear of her for future reference stay away from the women you work with sticky forget about her and get back in the game  Theory of conduct Social rule Friends Sin City Avenue Q Infantilism Transactional analysis EastEnders Kodocha A Course In Miracles Scientology beliefs and practices The Apprentice 2 Goodness and value theory Shaggy dog story Ranma __ characters Extreme Programming Futurama (TV series - season 5) Plame affair Days of our Lives Pitaten One Tree Hill (TV series) Sigmund Freud Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Homophobia Milton H.

do gender roles truly exist are they social or biological in origin how do you account for those who don't fit into the roles also if you could add your personal definition of gender role that would be very helpful as well please don't look it up cut paste in your own words how you think of it right now thanks so lori there's a subset role for a female that is the 'breadwinner' career woman who can't stand being around kids opens the door for men and there's a subset role for men who are 'househusbands' and incredibly nurturing to infants all things vulnerable show no aggression if the subset is completely the opposite of the role it's supposed to fit under isn't that kinda pointless contradictory there are studies showing that people treat babies differently depending on the sex of the baby without even realizing it even baby boys are called strong big while girls are called sweet cute i like your explanation kendrick i beleive it is a combination of both biological social the biological differences though i do not think are as strong as the social differences meaning biologically we're more flexible in our roles adaptability is one of the greatest of human evolutionary traits so i do not see how biologically strict gender roles would benefit but societies have often flourished at a certain point when people specialize gender roles would be similar to specializing would it not how in the world do you people figure i reject science i'm actually more into science than social science but i guess a few of you must have your prejudices presumptions degree in the humanities are you possibly confusing me with someone else i'm an engineer have applicable b s degrees both social and biological in a way gender roles happen in every society while men do gather and women do hunt in hunter gatherer societies or at least in some it's usually easier for a pregnant woman or a woman who's nursing a potentially noisy baby to gather women do most of the childrearing too because they've got the mammary glands also in early warfare where strength really does matter it makes more sense to send the men out to fight beyond the basics though it's all a matter of culture women aren't so much weaker than men that we can't do manual labor in fact women are used as the pack beasts in many countries men are also fully capable of playing with the babies and cooking a lot of our s gender assumptions are actually pretty new anyway and have more to do with wealth than gender in a poor family everyone has to work and in a farming family when it's harvest time it don't matter what you've got between your legs you're working it was only ever in the wealthier city dwelling families that women were kept in the home doing needlepoint or whatever the stay at home mom and working dad nuclear family arrangement only caught on in the us in the fifties because we were rich enough that people could do that  Sexual orientation Transgender Transsexuality Sex Physical attractiveness Theory of conduct Biology and sexual orientation Infantilism Woman Sociocultural evolution Gender-neutral language Orgasm Intelligent design Liberalism Anthropology Rape Family Species Capitalism Medicine Intelligence quotient Culture Affirmative action Objectivist philosophy Grammatical gender Wealth Androgen insensitivity syndrome Masculism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Homophobia Sociobiology Same-sex marriage Game theory Evolutionism Gender identity disorder Feminism Ethics Goodness and value theory Social psychology Joke Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Sex assignment Effeminacy Jacobo Arenas Creationism Girl Epistemology Karl Popper Dog Human English grammar Creation-evolution controversy Anarcho-primitivism War Microeconomics Man Homosexuality and transgender Meaning of life Gender identity Human sexual behavior Breast Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Soul Civil rights Supernatural Patriotism Marriage Altruism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Gay slang Religion Gray Wolf Intersexuality Atheism Child Social rule Franz Boas Cultural relativism Eugenics Neolithic Revolution Homosexuality Divorce Breastfeeding Democracy Community John Money

are men who have the courage to resist traditional masculinity less likely to be dumped by their wives we know the majority of divorces are initiiated by women men who display high hostility and strong conformity to masculine gender roles what the literature calls gender role conflict grc may cause distress to others particularly their wives a recent study indicates past research on men suggests such conformity limits their emotional lives and has linked high grc with lower self esteem increased anxiety and depression hostility toward women fear of intimacy homophobia and reluctance to seek help men displaying hostility in the videotaped discussions scored high in grc in their own and their wives' ratings and wives with the most marital dissatisfaction and depression rated their husbands highest on grc measures of restrictive emotionality power success competition and restrictive affectionate behavior between men men low in grc were less hostile during marital interactions and their wives were less depressed and more satisfied with the marriage indicating that men who have the courage to resist traditional masculinity are likely benefiting themselves and their spouse do 'super masculine' husbands make for unhappy wives http www apa org monitor oct husbands html if these men are driving their wives away how is it they blame 'feminism' for the result of their own bad behaviors kendrick i guess the entire american psycholgical association must be misandrist lol sorry son this stuff can be measured like it or not it's there let me repeat myself as stated above the researchers defined 'traditional male' attributes as measures of restrictive emotionality power success competition and restrictive affectionate behavior between men that these tendencies are there is borne out in prior research on the subject as expected i see plenty of ad hominem attacks against the researchers and me personally lol for those who don't know the bem sex role inventory bem are used to assess the degree to which men and women have internalized the gender stereotypic personality traits of agency instrumentality i e male stereotypic traits and communion expressivity i e female stereotypic traits engaging in gender typed behaviors is assessed using the sex role behavior scale srbs orlofsky and its short form companion orlofsky o heron the degree to which people have adopted traditional versus contemporary or liberal views about men women and the relationships between men and women is assessed using measures such as the attitudes toward women scale spence helmreich and the male role norms scale thomp son pleck thompson pleck fer rera other frequently used measures of gender role socialization include the gender role conflict scale grcs o neil helms gable david wrightsman con't from above the masculine gender role stress scale eisler skidmore and the feminine gender role stress scale gillespie eisler see beere for more examples of how gender role socialization can be measured the drive for muscularity and masculinity testing the associations among gender role trait conflict http www menshealth org code pmm a pdf guess that makes all the scales all the researchers misandrist huh did i get that right gypsy you've never even heard of any of this research before i know oops your message was to the abuser sorry in any event i'll bet of you or more had no idea this type of quantifiable research existed that pretty much de constructs you too jonmcn beware the cult of scientism jonmcn so far we have ad hominem argument by gibberish bafflement argument by prestigious jargon argument by repetition argument ad nauseam argument by changing the subject digression red herring misdirection false emphasis have i missed anything where is that guy now oh he's harrassing posters in the religion section now read his posts same old script each time notice he rarely if ever answers the question just bla bla bla hot air each response is virtually identical to the last one since when is 'science' an academic discipline anyway ya learn suppn' new every day on here yes kendrick sad but true old harridan is an attack on the person that's what ad hominem means right the guy who thinks he's the brainiest is the first to resort to ad hominem attacks what does that say about him as for the many other respondents i smell a conspiracy theory in the works the cultural gender belief system has influenced the ways in which difference and sameness has been studied in men and women early researchers conceptualizations of masculinity femininity conformed to a bipolar view the more contemporary plethora of research on masculinity femininity and expressivity instrumentality has created a body of knowledge that accepts these as coherent and measurable constructs there are many definitions and instruments developed to measure them sexual orientation gender role expression and stereotyping the intersection between sexism and sexual prejudice homophobia http counselingoutfitters com rees htm why are you guys still arguing with the scholarship on this subject there are reams of it collected and analyzed over many decades it s there you don t want to see it but it s there nonetheless i think the main issue here is the hostility which would certainly distress others regardless of whether it's paired with strong conformity to

why can't the women have an intelligent discussion about gender relations here one women posted that most of the men here are trolls who cannot have an intelligent discussion from what i see this is false unless the definition of troll is someone who doesn't agree with you and isn't afraid to say it the reason we can't have an intelligent discussion here is because a lot of women don't like to here opinions they don't agree with at least most of the men here give logical intelligent arguments that really make sense if you think about it the women just say i'm right and your wrong and if you can't see that i'm right you're a stupid woman hater also i'm aware that some answers are somewhat offensive but to me 'offensive' is just another way of saying not sugar coated to make you feel warm and fuzzy inside although women could make intelligent arguments i wouldn't doubt that but more often than not they're easily affected or agitated by the person whose viewpoints are different from theirs this phenomena has neverthless further lowered the intelligent level of the discussions by the most of the woman here and sometimes i got irritated by some typical answerings of stating that i've seen many women or men who don't do such such things or don't react in such and such manners if you happened to state your questions or opinions asking why do some women do this or that or have reacted in such and such a manner wasn't it annoying who'd know of that kinda statement honest or not or how to verify it wouldn't that it's so cunning and shrewd way of answering questions so if you'd like to talk about the issues of intelligent discussions here mike you could get certain responses that are intelligent but if you asked a question that seemed to have puzzled you to the women here in a most polite normal manner chances are you couldn't get the most honest direct answers either while some of the responses from the women side really represented the hatred of men and trying to hide the very truth of women's secrets women would answer the questions in a more indirect way as to protect their true motivations behind the facade  Theory of conduct Logic Internet troll Theodicy Social rule Philosophical skepticism Epistemology God Emperor of Dune Agnosticism Downing Street memo Philosophy of language Goodness and value theory Atheism William A.

why are women encouraged to claim special abilities over men but men cannot claim special abilities over women e g a harvard president is ousted for suggesting gender differentials in science but a department head of philosophy can successfully claim female superiority in the morals of compassion codrina that was an excellent citation on gender differences in iceland such observations merit further examination with this and your more personal examples you seem to be arguing for female superiority in matters of the heart and the training of children i don't object to this but cite it as an example where you seem to be happy to claim women do a better job of it than men can't you then accept the possibility that there may be areas where men excel over women it only seems fair and intellectually honest gender studies has a long ways to go if it cannot dispassionately examine differentials in abilities in the general case the conclusion that we should peremptorily judge each other according to gender should not follow even men should be allowed to rise in female dominated fields if they have the talent and bean counters should not claim the day if there isn't parity in areas of differing gender ability some things you should let go in one ear and out the other when such arguments arise  Economic inequality Gender-neutral language Ethics Gender role Economics Theory of conduct Franz Boas Sexual orientation Socrates Gender Human Affirmative action Feminism Sex and intelligence Science Postmodernism Utilitarianism Ontological argument Leadership Universal pragmatics Homophobia Divorce Logic Objectivist philosophy Masculism Social justice Falsifiability Plame affair Autism Intelligence (trait) Moral relativism Fathers' rights Causality Philosophical skepticism Gender identity Abortion debate Race and intelligence Goodness and value theory Deconstruction Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Philosophy of science Liberalism Sigmund Freud Political correctness Biology and sexual orientation Church of Christ Cultural relativism Same-sex marriage in the United States Free will Theodicy Ruth Bader Ginsburg Left-handed Noam Chomsky Homeschooling Neopaganism Guns, Germs, and Steel Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity The Bell Curve Bernard Williams Intellectual property Bertrand Russell Atheism Infantilism Mathematics Philosophy Reparative therapy Marriage Philosophy of space and time Transsexuality Aristotle Christian views of women Physics Race and intelligence (Public controversy) Epistemology Feminist movement Grammatical gender Strategic management Species Second language acquisition Western philosophy God English grammar Claude L__vi-Strauss Orgasm Psychology Democracy God and gender Graduate school

aren't there two sides to domestic violence women make it sound like men go around hitting and beating women just to be mean like we get a kick out of abusing women this is not true i want to ask the women here if they have ever been so angry at someone that they just hit them or punched them or really wanted to the first time i got arrested for beating my wife she had hit me in the head with a flash light the second time she threated to have porn delivered to my mothers house there are two sides to every story i think my physicaly strength is irrelevent considering the fact that its and she can easily pick up a gun and blow my head off while i believe that some women take advantage of laws to get men in trouble i also believe men have a decision to make whether to cooperate and put themselves in jail or walk away nobody forces you to become violent you make that decision on your own if your response to a verbal threat is beating then you're simply not taking responsibility for your own temper i in addition why did you stay with a woman who tried to unfairly put you in jail the first time  EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sin City Women in Islam Shaggy dog story Fred Phelps Fathers' rights Divorce Leon White YuYu Hakusho Social rule Knots Landing Rape Jam (TV series) Wyatt Earp Montreal Screwjob Pornography Tenshinhan Professional wrestling attacks The Marshall Mathers LP The Inside Tag Gun politics Humphrey Bogart Big Brother (USA TV series) One Tree Hill (TV series) Rock, Paper, Scissors International law Boxing Softball Professional wrestling match types Animal Liberation Front James Bulger New anti-Semitism Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Eric Cartman Beavis and Butt-head Daredevil Punisher Mike Tyson Marriage Professional wrestling slang The Contender (television series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Plame affair John McEnroe Babe Ruth Temperance movement Avenue Q Tupac Shakur Tom Leykis Sly Cooper Abortion debate The Time Machine Forty-seven Ronin Akuma (Street Fighter) Queen (band) The Misfits Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Sharia Wang Mang Vegeta Sonic the Hedgehog Hip hop music American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Human rights in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq British National Party Abu Musab al-Zarqawi Wing Chun Leo Frank Battle of Jutland The O.C.

debate on discrimination against women i have a debate topic women in high positions are discriminated against and i stupidly picked up the more tougher and controversial part against the motion i e i need to say that women are not discriminated against pls help some drafts ideas anything sensible there are always up to date studies to show how much money a woman earns per dollar that a man earns so there's a good place to start set your judgements aside and preconceived notions because there's no way to know the experience of women who occupy high ranking positions consider the definition of discrimination too not just what comes to mind but dictionary defined because this includes attitudes perceptions and other factors that are more subtle than other blatant forms of discrimination you did choose the harder side to support in this argument i guess you can challenge the statistics show how many women have advanced to positions of authority management exec directors etc and cite court cases in which women sued for discrimination and lost argue the subjectivitiy of perceived discrimination and tear that apart as a feminist transman i am out of ideas and glad to not argue that women aren't discriminated against in the workplace regardless of ranking position salary best of luck  Homophobia Gender role Sexual orientation Same-sex marriage Civil rights Feminism Music Fathers' rights Masculism Domestic violence Epistemology Psychology Atheism Affirmative action Postmodernism Economics Discrimination Species Political correctness Hate speech Divorce Transsexuality Cultural relativism Same-sex marriage in Canada Feminist movement Intelligent design United States Constitution Eugenics Human Scientific method Constitution of Ireland Creation-evolution controversy Equal Rights Amendment Federal Marriage Amendment Sexual harassment Racism Debate Strategic management Science The Apprentice 2 Philosophy Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Logic Microeconomics American Civil Liberties Union Theory of conduct Abortion Human nature Philosophy of mathematics New anti-Semitism Philosophy of space and time Bayesian inference Abortion debate Equal Protection Clause Postmodernity Artificial consciousness Lincoln-Douglas Debate Sex-positive feminism Monopsony Child sexual abuse Coercion Separation of church and state Media and ethnicity Men's rights Homeschooling History of women in the United States Gay rights Childlove movement Workplace democracy White (people) Reality Franz Boas International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict Controversies in autism Anarchism and capitalism Marriage OpenDocument Media bias in the United States Autistic community The Skeptical Environmentalist Education in the United States Roe v.

isn't nurturing actually a masculine trait i know motherhood is feminine but if you think about it its all about giving when you nurture you are giving and that is an active process but really the yin feminine energy is the receptive passive force and its the yang masculine energy that is the active force i think nurturing is a human trait we nurture those we love we nurture the sick children our pets it is part of compassion and both men and women may or may not feel compassion therefore nurturing i think depends in the individual  Yin and yang Goddess Gender role God the Father Force (Star Wars) Bulgarian language God and gender Nature versus nurture Biology and sexual orientation Ancient Greek Effeminacy Carl Jung Narcissism Given name Physical attractiveness Kuan Yin Sexual differentiation Homosexuality Tai Chi Chuan Grammatical gender God Feminism Yoko Ono Masculinity Tara (Buddhism) Gender-neutral language Zoophilia German grammar Culture Human sexual behavior Gay slang Human nature Hierarchy Numerology Vulgar Latin Hangul Woman Simone Weil Sesshomaru English grammar Gender identity Origin belief Amharic language Baldness History of intersex surgery Butch and femme Asperger syndrome Soul Chinese name Haruka Tenoh Man Dog Cross-dressing Homosexuality in China Sex Intersexuality Strategic management Opus Dei Eastern Orthodox Church Neopaganism Dualism Heteronormativity Friends Francis Galton The Giver Animal rights Sexual orientation Alignment (role-playing games) Breastfeeding Sociobiology Arabic grammar Catalan grammar Hebrew grammar Ranma __ characters Macbeth Blond I Ching divination Varieties of Arabic Absolute pitch Homosexuality and transgender Gaebyeok Aramaic of Jesus Anthropology Dharma & Greg Neolithic Revolution Cosmic year Irish initial mutations Sonar Italian grammar Gothic language Rhyme Action potential Empathy The Legend of the Condor Heroes Androgyny Androgen insensitivity syndrome Spanish pronouns Swish slang Breast

can women of today be equal to men since it's been done before in our women's studies classes we learned that in my country the philippines early women had egalitarian equal status to men during precolonial times they were even highly respected especially wives and formal contracts were done only in her presence then when the spaniards colonized the philippine islands the mentality was changed so that women were discriminated since it's been done before i'm wondering is it possible for women to regain their status okay to all who are answering this question i'm not trying to be a feminist here i'm just wondering if it's possible for the past to repeat itself despite present prejudices yes i think it can be done again that both men and women will be respected and valued and that we'll have a much better society but it is difficult when people see their roles changing they get scared angry and strike out so it will take a lot of progress and backlash but we'll get there  Feminism Masculism Feminist movement Civil rights Sexual orientation Affirmative action Homophobia Same-sex marriage Gender role Economic inequality History of women in the United States Separation of church and state Education in Japan Gender-neutral language Domestic violence Marriage Colonial mentality Conservatism Transsexuality Generation X Homemaker Spanish dialects and varieties History of feminism Gay rights Transgender Democracy Aesthetic Realism Swami Vivekananda Same-sex marriage in Canada Blood purity (Harry Potter) Martial art Liberalism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Culture Fathers' rights Mestizo Homosexuality Woman Blacks and Mormonism Left-handed Divorce Spanish language Bisexuality Equal Protection Clause Gender identity Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social psychology Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Bernard Williams The Handmaid's Tale Multiculturalism Racism Marxist feminism Animal rights Asian fetish Constitution of Japan Abortion debate Canadian Senate Iberian naming customs Constitution Legal aspects of transsexualism Filipino American Epeli Ganilau American Conservatism Homosexuality and transgender National Organization for Women Islam in the Philippines Human rights in the United States Black (people) Suffrage Manila Rabbi Jewish view of marriage Philippines Human height Clergy History of the United States (1865-1918) Prostitution Psychology Hispanic Lawyer Lodge Committee Equal Rights Amendment Golf Hinduism in the Philippines Anarcho-primitivism Democratic Party (United States) Feminists for Life Coming of Age (TNG episode) Human Social rule Franz Boas Philosophy of language Indigenous peoples of the Americas Patriarchy Religious Society of Friends Black Legend Demographics of Japan Multilingual

which gender really has it hardest when it comes to looking 'the ideal' i mean idealistically it wouldn't even be an issue because people would just be themselves unfortunately that's not how it is you often hear women though talk as if they are the only ones that have it hard they go over all the things they have to do which suck and they're legitimate such as shaving make up skin care hair weight loss etc etc you almost never hear about the things men have to do though while it is true that men more than women can just go out and about without having to look nice the thing is some men want to look nice too it doesn't seem to be generally appreciated how hard some men do have to work like going to the gym eating right dressing nicely and other such things all things considered i think both genders have it fairly bad what do you think also what are some examples i might have missed like for example women who talk about weight loss and how hard it is and 'how easy' it is for men who don't have to worry about it forget that some men like me have to gain weight which is much much harder than losing it they don't seem to appreciate that stuffing yourself all day and working out is much harder than cutting back slightly and going on a twenty minute jog the reason for so many ads targeting women is because they are the majority of shoppers simple as that marketings is all about appealing to the consumers one other thing must be considered the grass is always greener on the other side you have to deal with your own hardships every day so of course that's what comes to mind the strongest it's ever a down hill roll when it comes to competing with people who are born and grow good looking without even trying there is always a competition not necessarily only for looks but that's a huge factor and an attribute that is rarely overlooked it's not easy for men or women i have some good looking friends who can go out and get as many women as they want it's just easier when you have the look i also have friends who don't have it so many times they don't even try because they will be overlooked without a second thought most of the time the door simply swings both ways now going by my observations i'd say that women have a little harder when it comes to looks but they have way more rewards the power of a good looking woman is far greater than that of a good looking guy  Social rule Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Blonde on Blonde Physical attractiveness Equine conformation Shaggy dog story English grammar Transsexuality Little Britain Cliff Richard Ranma __ characters Goodness and value theory Time Out of Mind Infantilism Philosophical skepticism Volleyball Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Surveillance Kodocha Theodicy Jon Secada Microeconomics Capitalism Prisoner's dilemma Weight training Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Human sexual behavior Economic inequality Gender role ELO rating system Sexual orientation Merit Piccolo Junior Saga Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Infidels Friends Hair The Shining (film) The Contender (television series) The nature of God in Western theology Fast bowling Mojave people Conker's Bad Fur Day Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Baldness Diamond cut Unreal Paradox Anorexia nervosa Spidey Super Stories Cross-dressing Wood Characters in the Smurfs Hiberno-English Deflation (economics) Childbirth Aikido 613 mitzvot Stopping power Moral Politics Bodybuilding Ontological argument Eric Cartman Skateboarding trick Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Androgen insensitivity syndrome Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Beavis and Butt-head Knife Phoebe Buffay's songs Happy Tree Friends Socrates Epistemology Badminton Episodes of Lost (Season 1) W.

a made up scenario a woman was raped because she is unable to physically and mentally defend herself since then she cannot watch shows movies or news about somebody being murdered or anything about murder because she gets extremely disturbed and sick she can't even read a book that mentions the word murder why is this this is because deep down inside she realizes that she was lucky to survive the rape she knows that rape is an extremely violent act she likely has post traumatic stress syndrome she relives the violent memories of the rape over and over in her mind every time she sees something that reminds her of it murder topics trigger these memories and remind her of how close she came to becoming a murder victim she has not emotionally or psychologically healed from the traumatic event  Post-traumatic stress disorder Rape Traumatic incident reduction Traumatic brain injury Satanic ritual abuse Serial killer Mental illness Schizophrenia Sin City Asperger syndrome Cult Theory of conduct Vulcan (Star Trek) Abortion Domestic violence Psychological trauma Scientology Murder Paraphilia Child sexual abuse Narcissism Post-cult trauma Cube (film) Clinical depression Hypnosis Abortion debate Simone Weil The Lovely Bones Capital punishment Torture Nanking Massacre Amnesia Stress (medicine) The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever Days of our Lives A Course In Miracles Dissociative identity disorder Theodicy Autism Psychology Mind control Deprogramming Free will EastEnders Mind Aileen Wuornos Fight Club Grief Rape fantasy Vernon Schillinger Scenes from a Memory The 120 Days of Sodom Sigmund Freud Zoophilia Out-of-body experience Bene Gesserit Opposition to cults and new religious movements Jack Thompson Inhibited sexual desire Dead Like Me Transsexuality Karla Homolka Soul Violence The Inside Concussion of the brain Hulk (comics) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sharon Tate Lynching in the United States Video game controversy Meditation Homeopathy British National Party Cognitive science Slaughterhouse-Five Scream (film) Chronic fatigue syndrome Sadako Yamamura Psychosis Identity Crisis (comics) Brain Descendants of Darkness Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse A Beautiful Mind Theodore Kaczynski The Suffering (game) Borderline personality disorder Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Abduction Phenomenon The Invisibles Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Anorexia nervosa History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Jam (TV series) Kitty Genovese Meme

if men could fall pregnant and wanted to keep the child when you didn't want to have any children yet ladies what would you do support your partner as best as you can financially and emotionally leave the man to deal with it on his own push for an abortion other explain what if the man didn't want the child at all and decided to terminate the pregnancy what would you do a support the mans decision after all it's his body b you really want the child and would try to convince the man not to abort c other if the situation with pregnancy was reversed would women be completely comfortable with men having the final say in what happens quote 'women should have no say in the matter our bodies our choice ' ok but the baby takes two people to create it and when a woman becomes pregnant men want to have a say in what happens as well with the child which imo is wise to be able work issues out together but if men were only concerned about 'their bodies' then that's only taking a backwards view don't you think gldjns no i haven't been wronged by a man in this situation and i'm trying to stress that with the issue of pregnancy alot of men in real life are left out of having any say at all with what happens to their child as well i don't believe for a moment that just because it's a womans body that what she says is rule it may be the womans body but the child belongs to both man and woman and there should be more thought and compromise on this issue so i turn the tables and ask women what they think about whether they should have a say or not when alot of women don't believe a man should have any say at all wow great question i myself am months pregnant and in an interesting situation because the father left my baby and i because he's irresponsible so to look at the reversal role is actually quite amusing to me and i think a brilliant way to look at things knowing what type of person i am i would personally support my partner as best i could and if he decided to abort i would give him my reasons for supporting the abortion or convincing him why we should keep the baby based on our situation at the time i do think either male or female if she's going to have an abortion with very limited exceptions to this rule both parties have a right to know if abortion is a factor so supporting the man's decision without serious acknowledgement and consideration of both parties' view and input would not happen with me but that's just my opinion you get a star  Roe v.

how come thre are gender and women's studies but no men's studies surely in the interests of equality there is a women's institute but no men's institute only women would consider there was anything of interest or value in the study of themselves we have baggage issues etc all since the advent of feminism which mysteriously seemed to lift women onto a whole different plateau to that of men or so women think can you imagine the phrase 'me time' being coined with men in mind actually the real answer is probably something to do with the changing society women have experienced over the past century perhaps since ww ps men might be bad drivers but women are definitely illogical ones  Feminism Masculism Homosexuality and Christianity Gender-neutral language Sociology Woman Gender role Civil rights Same-sex marriage Sexual orientation Philosophy of language Transsexuality Bisexuality Abortion debate The nature of God in Western theology Feminist movement Fathers' rights Patriarchy Carl Jung Gender studies Transgender Sex-positive feminism Homophobia Affirmative action Fight Club Domestic violence Andrea Dworkin Effeminacy Matriarchy Orgasm Legal aspects of transsexualism Sadism and masochism Bulgarian language Gender identity Swami Vivekananda Women and Mormonism History of feminism Logic Radical feminism Autism Asian fetish Divorce Mary Wollstonecraft Biology and sexual orientation God and gender The Handmaid's Tale Bah__'__ Faith and gender equality Philosophy of mind Sexual revolution German grammar Power (sociology) Rabbi Cross-dressing Simone Weil Ideology Anarchism Social justice Video game controversy Heteronormativity History of women in the United States Gambler's fallacy John Money Homemaker National Organization for Women Christina Hoff Sommers History of intersex surgery Marxist feminism Jiddu Krishnamurti Pope Joan Pat Buchanan Maurice Merleau-Ponty Economic inequality Discrimination Women's studies H.

do some women get some kind of a 'high' off of rejecting men seems like there are a lot of women out there that will string a guy along who they are not really interested in for a certain amount of time then just walk away without giving him anything they usually leave when the guy starts to expect something for all his efforts i think this is cruel and selfish and i don't understand why some women feel the need to do this yep it's true women do reject' men for pleasure deidre that said it's a two way street' is wrong for one the main gender that has to do all of the asking at and effort is the man so men usually aren't in the position to reject a woman i think it's especially disgusting that women do this since most women don't know what it's like to make the effort to initiate conversation not an easy task many women obviously don't value or respect the courage a man has to have to just go up and talk to a woman especially since most women would be scared to death to walk up to a man and initiate conversation and make the first move also i notice women handle rejection far worse than men this girl i knew told me about how she decided to make the first move and talk to this guy to tell him she liked him you know something guys usually do and tried to ask him out he told her nicely that he wasn't interested and she was depressed about it for months she never initiated conversation or made the first move again after that not easy is it ladies to me i would like nothing better than to see these women that get a high off rejecting men be rejected themselves of course that may never happened since these women strategically put themselves in a position where they can't be rejected since they never initiate conversation or make the first move now how many women will get mad at me now that i've told the truth  Humphrey Bogart Social rule Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story EastEnders Friends God Emperor of Dune Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.

were you brought up in a sexist household i was brought up in a sexist household and i hated it my step dad was the most sexist man i have ever met he believed women are naive and can not be independent whenever he saw a female that was strong and independent he would call them whores he believed women should clean up after men and submit to them he made my mother quit her job and when she did she had to ask for an allowance like a little kid it broke my heart to see it he made my teenage years a living hell he owns several businesses and wanted me to work with him i refused and found other jobs he would also pick fights with me and then tell my mother i was the cause of it because of him i had a real problem trusting men in fact i had a me against the world type of attitude i despised the idea of marriage because my step father told me that the only way i would leave home is with a husband i proved him wrong and i moved out on my own i met a wonderful man that treats me like his equal i also went to therapy which helped alot my mom is still married to him i try not to visit when he is there my younger brother now has the same warped thinking as my step dad i have a year old little sister and she is my heart i hope she won't go through the hell i went through because she is so smart he is already trying to break her down if it were up to me i would have her to live with me thanks wendy g their type of ignorance is sad i'm and my brother is kendrickflorida read this carefully my step father believed men ruled over women he believed women should bow down to men he tried to his force his beliefs on me my step father basically wanted me to bow down to men which doesn't sit well with me i decided to take myself to therapy so i wouldn't go through life with a chip on my shoulder i now have a b a in psychology and my own place i'm at peace with myself now that i do not live with my step dad anymore i wanted to know if other people have experienced a similar environment perhaps you see nothing wrong with my step dad because you all may have the same mentality kendrickflorida read this carefully my step father believed men ruled over women he believed women should bow down to men he tried to his force his beliefs on me my step father basically wanted me to bow down to men which doesn't sit well with me i decided to take myself to therapy so i wouldn't go through life with a chip on my shoulder i now have a b a in psychology and my own place i'm at peace with myself now that i do not live with my step dad anymore i wanted to know if other people have experienced a similar environment perhaps you see nothing wrong with my step dad because you all may have the same mentality equal meaning he doesn't treat me as inferior to him my mother complained about this the men who are criticizing should really look at documentaries on this effects families today a young teen girl when through worse than what i went through her father totally ignored her because she was girl yet he did not physically or verbally abuse her instead he just stated that her brothers were better than her because she was a woman so rc before you judge someone you need to look at the full picture i never said i hated men this was just my experience and i see that the men answering my question have the same mentality as my step dad my boyfriend has other qualities than that if you must know so rc yes i have went to therapy for it so what what i went through with living my step dad made me stronger to say its normal normal for who you you really should reread my post i posted this question because someone else had posted this question months ago and yes drownezze that's what i mean by equality and for the people who didn't understand you could've just asked than judge thanks kendrickflorida for asking for more clarification rather than judge wow that's really sad for all of you your mom you kids and your story is not uncommon unfortunately i'm so glad you posted this and i really do hope that some of the men that write in sexist comments to this forum read what you have written here often enough and it amazes me there are men who are regulars in this forum who write in and say that women already have equality that there is no problem that exists in society today regarding that issue and it's so not true i think you are amazing in that you were brought up in a sexist environment and even at a young age you knew it was wrong you knew it hurt people and you had the presence of mind to resist falling into that same way of thinking i admire you for that often times the story goes the way you told it of your brother what children learn when they are young so often gets repeated when they grow up i'm very happy for you that you found someone to be with who treats you as an equal i'm glad that you didn't end up with someone who is just like your father pat yourself on the back for breaking the chain it's not easy to

anti feminist warren farrell is an avid anti feminist and masculinist is this what these movements are all about frankly i am shocked your opinion http www gate net liz fathers farrell yep i'd say warren farrell is an anti feminist and masculinist and he made a lot of money off of his shoddy research and opinions just like a lot of other masculinists and anti feminists do but some feminists have done shoddy research and used their opinions as the basis for their ideas so it's a common problem farrell was a member of now and got on a board but having worked with and for now since it's a volunteer organization anyone can join and just about anyone can be elected into many positions i was and it wasn't rocket science i was on a board too men get a lot of attention too in feminist organizations just like they do in any group that is made up of women so i'm not surprised he got lots of attention i also got tired of now and broke away i don't know why that doesn't get the press that farrell gets lol i disagreed with some of their leadership decisions and some of their positions on issues but i decided to later support the work they do that i agree with here's a review of one of his later books women can't hear what men don't say destroying myths creating love by warren farrell ph d warren farrell was in a fabulous position to help men address and change masculinity when he wrote his new book women can't hear what men don't say destroying myths creating love he could have used this book to help men to rewrite the masculine role in a manner that is much healthier and much more rewarding than the manner in which it exists today however that is not what he has done contrary to the book's subtitle it has neither destroyed myths nor created love it has not charted new territory that could ease communication between the sexes rather it has perpetuated existing myths and created excuses interestingly he refers to victim feminism and competitive feminism as two forms of feminism that he feared not disagreed with or disliked feared he had inadvertently shown how threatened he feels by the cultural changes feminism has affected and continues to affect in his bio as well as his other publications farrell frequently includes the statement that he is the only man ever to have been elected three times to the board of the national organization for women the quote gives the impression that he sat on the national board of n o w he didn't he sat on the board of the small new york city chapter of n o w well over twenty years ago which is a far cry from sitting on the national board in washington d c rarely if ever does he mention his current and very active memberships on the boards of men's and fathers' rights groups he is on the advisory board of fathers rights and equality exchange he is also on the board of directors of the national congress for fathers and children and the children's rights council these groups do not focus on child welfare or on improving relations between the sexes they concentrate on lowering or eliminating child support they claim that the vast majority of allegations of domestic violence and child abuse made by women are malicious lies designed to give the women an upper hand in court they seek forms of child custody that benefit only men such as mandatory joint custody in all custody cases regardless of research which has shown that joint custody has proven to be detrimental to children's welfare one incident farrell has placed under the lace curtain category vividly illustrates that he does not properly investigate claims mailed to him an america online subscriber had written to him claiming that feminists run aol and that aol actively discriminates against men by disallowing any men's issues discussion online it appears that farrell had taken this e mail at face value and merely passed on the news without looking into its accuracy he had stated that the men's issues discussions included active dialogue and men expressing themselves did he actually read those discussions the men's center where these discussions had taken place was never particularly busy most of the folders sat empty for days or even weeks at a time these discussions consisted primarily of a tiny number of men's rights supporters who engaged in ad hominum attacks against feminism and homosexuality especially when feminists were debating them the atmosphere was of course very contentious all around the subscriber who had contacted him displays palpable hostility in his writings he used epithets such as feminazi psychodyke estrogenic jihad homo anal males and homo anal sex as the perversion it so obviously is referring to feminists and homosexuals i know this because i had debated with men's rights advocates in those folders for several years does farrell support arrogant hostile misogynistic and homophobic rantings coming from those who claim to speak for the rights of men in addition the shutdown of some men's discussion folders had nothing to do with either feminism or men's rights aol had completely reorganized several years ago contrary to what farrell had written subscribers were notified of the imminent shut down of the old forums including the men's center the communities forum where these discussions had originally existed was eliminated to make room for the larger more extensive forums that are so popular on aol today there are plenty of folders all over aol where men may discuss men's health divorce and custody and the masculine role men's health is one forum where men may discussion their issues this forum was not mentioned in the book it's ironic that farrell blasts men's issues being discussed in talkwomen's feminist views area because he insists that women hear what men have to say maybe he wants women to hear what men say as long as he approves of the forum in which they hear it a major reason farrell may have been shunned by the feminist movement is not mentioned in this book the feminist publication 'off our backs' reported on this issue in once this issue is clarified it will become very clear why he has neglected to discuss it in the december issue of penthouse farrell was quoted in philip nobile's article incest the last taboo previously suppressed material from the original kinsey interviews tells us that incest is prevalent and often positive in this article farrell made many statements in obvious support of incest the article included the statement w hen i get my most glowing positive cases out of says farrell the incest is part of the family's open sensual style of life wherein sex is an outgrowth of warmth and affection it is more likely that the father has good sex with his wife and his wife is likely to know and approve and in one or two cases to join in in addition farrell was quoted in this manner m illions of people who are now refraining from touching holding and genitally caressing their children when that is really part of a caring loving expression are repressing the sexuality of a lot of children and themselves t housands of people in therapy for incest are being told in essence that their lives have been ruined by incest in fact their lives have not generally been affected as much by the incest as by the overall atmosphere and he claims to be clueless as to why feminists no longer wish to contact him this is the most tragic thing about women can't hear what men don't say farrell was in a position to help men make real lasting positive changes in their lives and he punted the ball he favored blaming feminists for the ills experienced by men rather than give men the reins to make the necessary changes themselves he is well known plenty of people who have never picked up one of his books have heard of the name warren farrell even if he were to attempt to assist men in making real lasting changes the men and women who look up to him may not accept such a turnabout from him the men's and fathers' rights movements have a very heavy presence on the internet site after site blame the feminist movement for many of the problems that men may experience it's so much easier to point a finger at feminism than it is to do the time consuming exhausting and thankless work necessary to restructure a gender role from the inside out  Laura Schlessinger Fight Club Ethics Scientology

why do males account for over of alcohol poisoning deaths see http pubs niaaa nih gov publications arh pdf for details is it because they don't do as well in 'drinking competitions' or at driving like crazies and paying higher insurance premiums for the 'privilege' of doing so what might raging hormones have in common in both scenarios what about drinking and driving competitions which gender is more likely to engage in that man in search of direction get a grip no mikey the evidence says you are wrong rates are highest for single men the rate was lower among married than unmarried people i e never married divorced or widowed us men choose more lethal methods and actually kill themselves at higher rates absolutely true and they also more successfully kill others too at higher rates i wasn't surprised that a large number of males were dying of alcohol poisoning deaths but what was surprising was the age group second contrary to heightened public concerns about alcohol poisoning deaths among college students characteristics associated with the highest risk of death from alcohol poisoning are being middle aged unmarried less educated or a male from a racial or ethnic minority group so instead of society worrying primarily about college and young adult males drinking binges society should also be concerned about middle aged unmarried less educated or a male from a minority group the stat's about suicide a poster provided didn't point out that more us women attempt suicide us men choose more lethal methods and actually kill themselves at higher rates though what that has to do with male politicians votes and feminism is beyond me  Mothers Against Drunk Driving Divorce Marriage Affirmative action Woman Domestic violence Health insurance Transsexuality Suicide EastEnders Life insurance Suicide methods Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Insurance Economic inequality Bisexuality Fathers' rights ELO rating system Cancer Gender role Capital punishment Arguments for and against drug prohibition Apprenticeship Androgen insensitivity syndrome Knots Landing AIDS pandemic Unemployment Education in the United States History of intersex surgery Masculism Single Transferable Vote Culture of the United States Breastfeeding Demographics of Japan Humphrey Bogart Feminism Alcohol Voter turnout Biology and sexual orientation Theory of conduct Intelligence quotient Blood alcohol content Abortion debate Risk management Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus DDT Sexual abstinence Theodicy Hypoglycemia One Tree Hill (TV series) Ernest Gellner AIDS Autism Same-sex marriage Barbara Boxer Annuity Predatory lending Birth control Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Intersex surgery Brigham Young University Euthanasia Education in the People's Republic of China Binge eating disorder Prostate cancer Infantilism Anorexia nervosa Caffeine Cable television Homosexuality and Christianity Cannabis (drug) Henry Lee Lucas Sexual orientation Tax Lethal injection Holy Orders Heteronormativity Alcoholics Anonymous Children of God Puberty British national identity card Age of consent Nuclear warfare Democratic Party (United States) Literacy Demographics of the United States Poison Orgasm Ragnarok Online Same-sex marriage in Canada Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) American individualist anarchism

why do women so poorly at driving competitions one would assume that women who tend to be lighter would have huge success as racers yet there are very few women who race and even less who win and please avoid the everyone is beeing sexist card we have classy gypsy cat lets see how good your german italian is put up or shut up the ratio of women to men is a factor but with regards to what tera said there is no reason why women should ever be welcomed into mens' racing they don't belong there just as men are not welcomed into the wnba or wpga nor do they belong there either it seems to me that when one compares women and men that compete it really comes to a win win for women and a lose lose for men what do women stand to lose nothing what do women stand to gain a lot as made evident by female racer danika patrick being showered with winner status for being the third loser and she hasn't won anything yet she is treated like a major racing celebrity and she hasn't won anything since the early 's when her scrawny lightweight body helped her win in cart racing where weight is a huge factor what do the men stand to gain by women being there less than nothing if men beat women so what they beat a girl if women beat men they and their manhood reputation career sense of accomplishment are just fodder in female pursuit of tromping around in the mans' arena a sport created established promoted and sacrificed to by men they have nothing to gain and everything to lose when women are there for men it is just lose lose with regards to women women could change that you know in some way men could actually win something if they beat women in a race maybe the race commission could give men more points for every lap they have on the girl at least give them some incentive for not letting the girl pass them there is a way to make this fair since women have nothing to lose women could offer something so men would actually have a reason to race women one thing i have learned in this is that there are women out there who actually have respect integrity honor and humility with regards to their role in society and to men that is why we don't know who they are if they really exist they let men be men and enjoy their accompishments and then there are arrogant spoiled females the nervy girls with the attitude who have nothing to lose big deal why don't they let spoiled children race as well women competing with against men is a win win for women and a lose lose for men women have everything to gain and nothing to lose men have everything to lose and nothing to gain if women want to race let them start their own racing league like men start all of their own of everything else it is even easier for women now because men have already established the infrastructure that wasn't present when they started from scratch the truth of the matter is no one would watch a womens' racing network any more than they watch wnba or wpga people want to see the best this is why they watch men facts are facts name calling won't change them question if men treat competing women the same way they treat competing men would it be singled out as sexism or should men fumble over themselves to help out the little lady maybe let her win etc etc etc  Indianapolis 500 Boxing Theory of conduct The Contender (television series) New York Giants Tour de France 24 Hours of Le Mans Women's National Basketball Association Sexism Transsexuality Chariot racing The Apprentice 2 Professional wrestling match types The Amazing Race Friends Playoff format National Football League Auto racing Female bodybuilding Poker jargon Iditarod Single Transferable Vote Economic inequality IBM PC compatible Anorexia nervosa Alex Ferguson World Series Penske Racing Valentino Rossi Physical attractiveness Opus Dei Domestic violence U.S. Electoral College Capitalism Ben Johnson (athlete) The Ashes Norway national football team Mario Kart 64 Badminton Feminism Human Gender-neutral language Jacky Ickx Woman Gambling 2000 Australian Grand Prix Ice hockey Urinary incontinence Ayrton Senna New England Patriots Rugby union Triathlon St. Louis Rams Bicycle Professional wrestling slang The Boat Race Audi Diving Kurt Angle Sport NASCAR Gender role Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)

would allowing gay marriage bring stability to the gay community and would making divorce more difficult to obtain bring more stability to straight community i think that gay marriage would bring more stability to not only the gay community but society in general divorce being harder to obtain however would not bring stability staying married to someone despite major problems brings chaos not stability forcing people to try to reconcile their differences may seem like a good idea on the surface because some people take marriage and divorce far too lightly but even so forcing people to stay together against their will is bad for the all the people involved esp the children people don't change unless they want to change laws can't force people to love each other i'm not sure that i agree with the post above that said that making marriage more difficult to obtain would be a good solution because who then would be the good authority to decide who should marry and for what reasons it's too complicated to have too many restrictions how would they be enforced and how fair would they be to all just my opinion  Marriage Same-sex marriage in Canada Divorce Same-sex marriage Human sexual behavior Polyamory Federal Marriage Amendment American individualist anarchism Religion and sexuality Fathers' rights Lawrence v.

why do so many women want a commitment from men i just spent the weekend with my girlfriend and it was fantastic but now she wants a deeper commitment she wants me to dump my other two girlfriends and date her exclusively of course this will not happen so their goes another good thing ruined because women always need commitment why can't we all just have a good time ladies i'll commit but asking me to make you number one is just asking too much brad is number one personal opinion the demand for exclusivity comes largely from hypo ego low self esteem women who demand to take hostages in a relationship are afraid of losing out to a better looking smarter or otherwise more desirable woman not to be ignored is the stds that can be transmitted to others involved in poly amorous situations as well add to that some women demand men to be exclusively available to support her and her choices especially when her choice is to become pregnant and give birth then divorce or file for child support when she can legally obtain it without having to put anything back into the relationship lastly when one can demand a committed relationship there are more finances available to them than if there were others vying for equal or similar attention it is similar for men as far as hypo ego is concerned as well as stds beyond that the most likely reason men want exclusivity to a woman is to better insure that any children she produces for him to support are more likely to be his  Polyamory Human sexual behavior Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus EastEnders Polygamy Oral sex Domestic violence Divorce Microeconomics Knots Landing George Costanza Simone Weil Transsexuality Sexual orientation Sexually-transmitted infection Friends Condom One Tree Hill (TV series) Fathers' rights Abortion in the United States Same-sex marriage in Canada Paternalism Poker jargon Theodicy Abortion debate Marriage About a Boy Abortion Philip J.

why do you think wendy mcelroy defends pornography while claiming to be a feminist http www secularhumanism org library fi mcelroy html kind of an interesting viewpoint and it strongly goes against the thinking of the likes of andrea dworkin and katherine mckinnon my carrie this certainly touched a nerve with you i'm not sure if pornography is beneficial to women personally or politically hence encouraging women to get into the sex industry however i do not judge women who choose that path as i believe it to be a personal decision you can be pro women and enjoy tasteful pornography too the two don't necessarily contradict each other i don't like watching women get beat or abused in a movie but i enjoy watching two beautiful adults having consensual sex those who become promiscuous use their bodies for money etc mostly do it due to financial reasons or past sexual trauma either way they need our support and compassion not judgment and prejudice some become businesswomen like jenna jameson they continue to remain in the business because they choose to who are we to say what is degrading or not for them to do as women we should strive to supporting each other so that all women have more options to choose what they want to do with their lives but never judge another for their personal decisions  Sex-positive feminism Human sexual behavior Andrea Dworkin Feminism Transsexuality Christian right Infantilism Zoophilia Feminist movement Masculism Child sexuality Sexual orientation Prostitution Abortion debate Anarcho-capitalism Civil rights Pornographic actor Gender role Anal sex 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Homophobia Fathers' rights Child sexual abuse Sexual dysfunction Orgasm The 120 Days of Sodom Childlove movement Bondage (BDSM) Rape Pornographic movie Same-sex marriage Pornography in Japan Motion picture rating system Human sexuality Incest Linda Lovelace Oral sex Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Sexual addiction BDSM Jenna Jameson Lesbian Homosexuality and Christianity Dissociative identity disorder Gender-neutral language Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Election Consensual crime Decision making Larry Flynt Androgen insensitivity syndrome Microeconomics Paraphilia Pedophilia Divorce History of feminism Roman Catholic Church North American Man/Boy Love Association Women in Islam Catharine MacKinnon Exorcism Atheism Prejudice Roe v.

what do you do in the real world to help inequality and abuse i know i asked this question before but the kind of material that i read here today makes me ask this question again are you helping a cause to stop racism are you helping to stop torture are you helping to stop death penalty are you doing something to stop wars are you really doing something to help stop abuse be it men children or women are you helping stopping cruelty to animals are you doing positive actions against homophobia this question comes after reading someone that has the idea of making a change in the internet to destroy feminism lol but what about the real world it is easy to write here but are we doing a positive change in real life thanks yes i should say what i am doing in real life i am part of a program against animal cruelty i am a member of amnesty international regarding abuse to men women and chidlren i subsidize education and well being to an adopted girl in africa and if i post here is because i want to reach others to make positive actions or at least eventually to think about it crk i am not rich either besides the child in africa the rest is about active participation no money too little place here to explain you have a very good point i think most ethical people would be surprised just how many adults couldn't pass elementary school ethics http www goodcharacter com ycc doingright html many of us learned this in church temple many in school many from a loving parent or other adult many of us had to learn this stuff on our own the hard way most of us learned a combination of it essentially it boils down to doing the right thing as often as possible this doesn't always mean joining a club or whatever it must be nice that you can brag that you're a member of a reputable organization that does good works but is that because you were able to afford the dues and give them your money or is it because you're actually participating in things that help people and animals in my case i've tried to join several organizations and they wouldn't have me because i had no money for membership fees seems these places although probably well intended are for the well off poor people need not apply however that won't stop me from making as many correct choices each day that i can to say a kind word or nothing to walk instead of drive if i am physically able to intervene before violence erupts if i can to speak rather than allow myself to be silenced by the wrong people learn from what they read on the internet the more right stuff they read the more likely it is to help them do the right thing for some of us that's all we can offer right now our minds our education our experience and so forth if you can do more or differently that's great http www utm edu research iep e ethics htm  Theory of conduct Animal rights Economic inequality Theodicy Domestic violence Education Scientology beliefs and practices Autism rights movement Abortion debate Childlove movement Transsexuality Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Simone Weil Fight Club Anthroposophy Capital punishment Human Avenue Q Blacks and Mormonism Transactional analysis Microeconomics The Subtle Knife Education in the People's Republic of China Nicomachean Ethics Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Socrates Motivation Rudolf Steiner Utilitarianism Philosophy of language Abortion in the United States Ethics World Wide Web Homophobia EastEnders Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The nature of God in Western theology Alcoholics Anonymous Kodocha Religion Infantilism Scouting LaVeyan Satanism Summa Theologiae Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Economics MoveOn Amnesty International Eugenics Incarnations of Immortality Deconstruction Zoophilia Unitarian Universalism People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Paradox Bernard Williams Patriotism Jiddu Krishnamurti A Course In Miracles Extreme Programming Friedrich Schleiermacher Altruism Mediation Animal Liberation Front Abortion Time Out of Mind Kasparov versus The World Rick Santorum Franz Boas Merit Serial killer Opus Dei Education reform Meme Ten Commandments Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Democracy American Psycho Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Torture The Human Stain Sin City Divorce Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mumia Abu-Jamal Mojave people Child sexual abuse Social psychology Richard Feynman German grammar Opposition to cults and new religious movements

lads are these actions worth spoiling your life with sexual harrassement when we work in the office whats the point of looking and admiring a nicely dressed female or talking to her is it worth losing your credibility and job molestation there are plenty of women who would sleep for a night for some money or a dinner then why the hell this unprotected sex in todays society the male stands to lose more than a female as the system is geared to protect and crucify the guy so why my dear lads do you think they are really that important that you should go ahead destroy your life is this because young males need to be educated about the biased legal system and their need to fend for themselves in this gender biased society edit keith boyo you in some ways remind me of my myself i appreciate and respect your answer keith but you must understabd there is a lot of misuse of these situations by the opposite sex because of ignorance educate ones self is hard to do if one dose not realize it to begin with hence young and dumb do we need to educate young men yes should we educate them to thank that women have it all set up to fry us at a whim no we should educate them with good morals and to be more responsible to treat ladies with respect and to watch out for the bad because there is bad as well as good far as sexual harassment in the work place well again educate them to treat the ladies with respect and not to partake in sexual play talk or the like at work or in school or in any public domain but to say such play for the bed room and with the right girl women they are in a relationship with no i do understand man in search of answers and these laws can and have been used to fry guys just because the women didn't like him or some thing other that was not a real true case to but these laws are here and they are now in place so we have to understand that it is not wroth it and to be careful the way to do that is to educate are sons so that it slowly but surly can be turned i say that because then more will stand up to one who is wrongly accusing and perhaps then the laws will change to find that in fact it dose go both ways  Avenue Q Theory of conduct Sex Human sexual behavior EastEnders Pedophilia Gender role Little Britain Humphrey Bogart Sexual orientation K' Child sexual abuse One Tree Hill (TV series) Sexual harassment Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Gender identity Human sexuality Friends Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Transgender Feminism Sex and the City Homophobia Equal Protection Clause Discordianism Abortion debate Age of consent About a Boy Rape Plame affair Domestic violence Nicomachean Ethics Ex-gay Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!

why are feminists so quick to dismiss the faults and wrongs of women i posted a question that stated women commit more domestic violence than men right away all the women were like give me a source thats not true more men are in jail you have to take into consideration the fact that most men do not report acts of violence done to them by women as much as vica versa if a man slaps a women he might get arrested a women would have to seriously injure a man before he would call the police or report it you also have to take into consideration the fact that violent acts by women are not take as 'seriously' and women often get lighter or no jail sentence for the same crime a man commits why can't women admit that they are just as big a part of the problems in this world as men are women are not as abusive as men sorry that statement is pure sh t women are more emotionally and psychologically abusive men don't complain as much so it seems like men are more abusive i agree no one should hit anybody man or woman a woman that hits a man is just as wrong as a man that hits a woman  Domestic violence Rape Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Spousal abuse Sin City Plame affair Serial killer Fathers' rights Abu Musab al-Zarqawi Ex-gay Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 EastEnders Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) O.

feminists what can we do to quill the stereotypes attached to our beliefs it seems so many anti feminist arguments are based on stereotypical ideas of what feminism is and not the truth my usual reaction to this is for god sakes please read a book about it before jumping to the flannel wearing man hating lumberjack conclusion but this solution implies that only the unknowlegdeable are responsible for this stereotype and i am a firm believer in taking personal responsibility in any conflict situation is there anything we are doing to perpetuate the stereotypes and what can we do to cast them aside hmm clearly the spirit of personal responsibility is one sided so far nothing on what someone can do themselves just a whole lotta you should do this or you should do that yeah we're really getting somewhere sorry to disappoint delish as i've said many times i consider myself feminist masculist and equalist extraordinaire lol perhaps as some seem to have assumed that my beliefs do not fall in line with feminism because i post often about men's rights goes to show that the feminist stereotypes are alive and well she doesn't hate men so she must not be a feminist right wrong go burn my bra and stop bothering you eh lol ladies seriously there must be something we can do about this some answerers are making it waaaay to easy for me to just blame their ignorance of the subject i emailed u delish well i think it's too late maybe not in all actuality but too many feminists are the man hating bla bla bla and they don't want to change stereotypes run us we want to know what we're getting into before we get into it so we make rash judgments it's not going to change no matter what we do because too many like being the stereotypical feminist and too many like having a stereotype to attack with all we can hope to do is change the minds in the small world around us let our friends see that we are who we are and don't fall in the stereotype and even when we do follow one stereotype it doesn't defne us  Feminism Theodicy Gender role Feminist movement Abortion debate Postmodernism Masculism Theory of conduct God and gender Gender-neutral language Homophobia Religion Deconstruction Philosophical skepticism Phaedo Transcendental argument for the existence of God Ten Commandments Religion and sexual orientation Ethics God Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Propaganda Fictional character Goodness and value theory Supernatural David Hume Plame affair Creationism Socrates Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Fathers' rights Moral Politics The nature of God in Western theology Charles Darwin's views on religion Sex-positive feminism Internet troll Bob and George Little Britain Criticism of Mormonism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Objectivist philosophy Public domain John Wycliffe Fight Club Presuppositional apologetics Joke Philosophy of language Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Goldstein's book Scientology beliefs and practices Anti-Mormonism Trinity A Course In Miracles Political correctness Mary Wollstonecraft Mary, the mother of Jesus Moral objectivism Atheism Anarchism Animal rights Religious Society of Friends Kyle Broflovski New Testament Transsexuality Dualism (philosophy of mind) God Emperor of Dune Evil Simone Weil Reaction to Darwin's theory Complexity classes P and NP Free will Grimke Sisters Roman Catholic Church Mormonism and Christianity LaVeyan Satanism Autism Hate speech Opposition to cults and new religious movements Paradise Lost Utilitarianism John Howard Yoder Professional wrestling match types Social psychology Same-sex marriage in Canada Children of God Great Apostasy Social rule New anti-Semitism Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Vacuous truth Adam-God theory Democracy Karen Horney

anti feminists do you really think hostile critisism on an internet forum will cause feminism to collapse if not what is the goal of this while i see a few critically productive posts on this forum the majority don't seem to be either seeking knowledge nor intending to give productive knowledge forgive me of my presumption that thats what questions and answers are supposed to provide rather it seems so many are trying to prove a point which i admit have also been guilty of from time to time but why the hostility in my mind if you were truly trying to sway people to change things positivly and not just using this as a place to vent your anger the adage you catch more flies with honey seems to apply ugh feminists please see subsequent stereotype question arguing with this guy will do nothing right nevermind the millennia before that years no but you must remember that the french revolution or paris commune started on a very ordinary incident big things have small beginnings and as long as you have the people behind with their heart in that cause there will be revolution revoltion can be in many ways  Feminism Cultural Revolution Internet troll Philosophy Philosophical skepticism The nature of God in Western theology Extreme Programming Postmodernism Philosophy of language Plame affair Metaphysics Gender-neutral language Anarchism Deconstruction Theory of conduct Psychology Internet forum Karl Marx Mathematics Critique of Pure Reason History of socialism Supernatural Scientific revolution Epistemology Schapelle Corby Summa Theologiae Abortion debate Victor Cousin David Hume 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Past teachings of Prem Rawat Coercion Cheating in Counter-Strike Cultural relativism Law of value W.

is there a difference between third wave feminists and postfeminists http www electronicbookreview com thread writingpostfeminism reconfiguredrip ok i am getting really confused by all of these labels and also find them to be a bit borish what do you think i find it tedious but all the labels come from considering historic context and for those recording history it does matter obviously suffragettes trying to get women the vote are not the same as pro choice lobbyists and hence the labeling begins from all i can see feminists were energetic and idealistic and fired up and to make a post feminist add irony and less sleep from working the longer hours we fought for third wave feminists are our teenage daughters by the time they can vote and actually start voting the issues will have changed somehow someone has to keep very close track of these things and write them down and this right here is about as much as i ever plan to do  Feminist movement History of feminism Feminism History of women in the United States Women in Islam Congress of the United States Gender-neutral language First-wave feminism Deconstruction Domain Name System Gender role Textile manufacturing HyperText Transfer Protocol Political correctness Democracy Mach kernel Abortion debate Masculism Gmail Thread (computer science) Civil rights Sexual abstinence Sigmund Freud World Wide Web Suffragette CPU cache Julia Stiles Uniform Resource Locator MP3 Women's cinema Androgen insensitivity syndrome Drag racing Feminists for Life Artemisia Gentileschi DragonFly BSD Daylight saving time Bratmobile Energy Joy Division (band) Transfeminism Internet troll Women's suffrage Perl Kristin Hersh Vegeta Mary Wollstonecraft Fall Out Boy Triathlon Record label Explosive material Emo Joss Whedon H.D.

are feminists are feminists lesbians the majority of feminists are heterosexual men and women since they make up the majority of the population some feminists are lesbians bisexual and gay men in the second wave of feminism during the 's there was a lot of conflict over whether lesbians should be supported as feminists since some feared that lesbians would give the movement a bad name so some lesbians left some of the feminist groups some lesbians stayed some heterosexual women left feminist groups and most heterosexual women stayed but the moderate feminists were right unfortunately homophobia is often the first weapon used against feminists to put them on the defensive and to denigrate the feminist movement since anti feminists like to imply that if feminists are all lesbians they must be man haters and they don't count since they are not real women it's been very effectively used by conservatives traditionalists right wingers and religious sexists to keep women in their place many women are afraid to admit they are a feminist because they'll be accused of being a man hating lesbian and homophobia is used against men who dare to call themselves feminists as well the first thing many people say about a male feminist is that he has to be gay or that he's not a real man  Homophobia Feminism Gay rights Bisexuality Gender role Sexism Heteronormativity Lesbian Queer Homosexuality Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Same-sex marriage Domestic violence Religion and sexual orientation Homosexuality and Neopaganism Ex-gay LGBT Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Homosexuality and transgender Gender-neutral language Reparative therapy Same-sex marriage in Canada Violence against gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and the transgendered Sex-positive feminism Transgender Biology and sexual orientation Andrea Dworkin Feminist movement Outing History of women in the United States Anti-gay slogan Gay Sexual orientation Human sexual behavior Transsexuality Homosexuality and Judaism Effeminacy Transvestism Masculism Heterophobia Federal Marriage Amendment Hate group Butch and femme Second-wave feminism Gay slang Drag queen Jews as a chosen people Dianic Wicca Same-sex marriage in the United States Childfree Religion and sexuality Gay community Coming out Hate speech Age of consent Liberal movements within Islam Homosexuality in China Choice and sexual orientation God and gender OutRage!

why are men so intimidated by feminist i thought it was strange there were posts in the women gender section with males posting homosexually satiated references towards women or hate posts call me crazy but i thought this would be a positive forum for women exchanging women gender issues when i realized it was the word feminism that was scaring them into feeling like they need to attack i actually forgot this word and its context even existed but do consider myself just a normal strong willed woman like thousands of other heterosexual women in this world that also discern society steadily growing more into a womans world with the role reversals and more women being head of their households and holding more and more powers of position in society its buts its funny to watch some of these guys wishing it was still 's and whine and cry about it definitely other peoples garbage and not mine but its still fun to watch the fear lol well the truth obviosly hurts because all the answers im getting are from men who sound hurt and insulted theres no intelligent arguements well a couple but not many i'll admit i have lost my interests up to probably the th comment but i will say that man in search of answers if i ever was to have children or a male child i would raise him like my mother did my brother and thats to be a confident male self assured and not easily intimadated by what peole do and say thats a self esteem problem and nothing more my male child better not be soooo emotional and worried enough to log into a womens gender issue forum and looking for issues to waste time attacking women on if you ask me we're all feminine in this section whoever posts here lol really in order for you to be annoyed you have to feel some form of intimidation or else you wouldnt feel the need to fight back people fight out of fear theres no other origination that stems from that then fear if it wasnt that big of an issue to you for you to feel intimidated you wouldn't even have a thought on it or be annoyed people dont waste time on the petty things in life they put their energies on big ones in otherwords the state of women today and where we're going is totally intimidating the weaker species amoung us the normal strong men dont even think about feminists they're too busy handling their business and co collaberating with women to make things work out just right like bill clinton and hundreds of other polticians and males that know its about homogeneity and confomance and not about whining and complaining and you're right dan a the one thing that women couldn't possibly do better than men is engulf the world in war and violence we need a craphole clean up quick with brains running things instead of nothing but ego even though it would take a total or majority xx chromosome takeover in the whitehouse for that to happen so dont anybody hold their breath on that one and troll feminists and lifes feeble worried men both share the same charactertistic fear thats why they're made for each other and spend so much time time fighting some men are intimidated by my looks and actions but that is the key word some  Gender role Biology and sexual orientation Domestic violence Homophobia Gender-neutral language Feminism Social rule Shaggy dog story Transsexuality Homosexuality and transgender Fathers' rights W.I.T.C.H.

do women really crave sex as much as men read the whole question please because men who crave sex are not that picky when it comes to good looks guys are even sexually attracted to girls of below average looks why do you think so many teenage guys fantasize about their friends' moms there is this woman in my martial arts class she is somewhat chubby and she looks like she is in her early or mid s but i think she is so hot she has pretty eyes and the way she looks at me is just sexy girls on the other hand always focus on a guy's negative features that is why they are only attracted to a really small percentage of guys so is it really fair to say that women crave sex as much as men do and don't start going on about how you have have a boyfriend who is of below average looks but you think he's hot because that's only because you have feeling for him i'm talking about guys you think are sexually attractive saja you are missing my point and you are completely misunderstanding me i am anything but shallow and i am not perverted i never said women in their s who are a bit chubby would not be hot i am saying that they are hot and a lot of guys probably agree but women do not find men in their s who are slightly chubby attractive even if they have pretty eyes and no i do not have a narrow minded opinion of what is attractive your answer fails automatically just for saying that as i've said before i find all kinds of women attractive there are very few women i don't find attractive and i actually don't know many women who don't have a narrow minded definiteion of attractiveness most women even admit they only find of guys attractive and no i don't care what some stupid movie has to say because what i'm saying is based on reality and as for the whole 'leave her alone' crap what the hell makes you think i'm harassing her she doesn't even know i think she's hot i never said anything about wanting to have sex with her actually it's pretty inappropriate for someone her age to be having sex with someone my age but you probably disagree because any guy you'd be interested in doing is probably around my age and just to let you know you're probably times shallower than i am most women are i am not the least bit shallow and when did i say i consider her below my standards i guarantee she considers me below her standards why the hell would she wanna hook up with me women only wanna hook up with the really hot guys which i am not as you can see you've completely misjudged me and you must feel really stupid right now maybe next time you'll think before you post a completely rude and insulting answer without even understanding the question women are individuals you have to get to know us one by one to discover if we crave sex as much as men oh and by the way men are individuals too not all men crave sex equally below average looks according to whom do you really believe everyone has the same opinion of what constitutes below average looks or above average looks people are individuals and their opinions of beauty are individual why would somewhat chubby early to mid s with pretty eyes not be hot are only women who look like barbie dolls hot hmmm girls like boys yourself included often have a very narrow media influenced opinion of what constitutes attractiveness this tends to expand and change as girls and boys mature please leave the woman in your martial arts class alone she is there to do martial arts not to serve your fantasies she deserves someone far less shallow than you who obviously only want to have sex with her on the other hand maybe it would do you good to be used by her maybe she just wants a quick hookup with you and otherwise considers you to be below her standards reality check time argh rent the movie shallow hal and take notes  Human sexual behavior Social rule Little Britain Barbie Spice Girls Theory of conduct Abortion debate The Ashlee Simpson Show Zoophilia Kodocha Cliff Richard Child sexual abuse Milton H.

ideas for a short project to improve the body image of high school girls i want to organize a week or a month long project that aims at pointing out issues concerning distorted body image and eating disorders at a high school what kinda activities could i organize that will actually make ppl participate any ideas i was just reading an article about with regards to the recent backlash to celebrities such as britney girls were choosing more modest dress and less provocative actions to prevent the attention to being drawn to their physical appearance young ladies should be able to list all the qualities that they find appealing in others which do not include their physical appearance we as a society should be focusing on these rather that valuing a female strictly on her physical attributes and how they fall into the colonialist ideal of beauty defending and encouraging thinness surgery and cosmetic enhancement only leads to a further loss of identity and positive self worth boys are encouraged to make themselves larger by working out with weights and building muscle girls are encouraged to become smaller by dieting down to emaciation have these girls write letter in response to ads that objectify and criticize how women look if they are aware of the marketing techniques they will be less apt to fall for that bait the dove campaign on dove com has a few useful suggestions as well as looking up female girl or women empowerment femina com is a search engine of many women friendly net resources perhaps that can be part of the project is to find useful role models and net places that build not destroy the esteem of women  Advertising Autism Physical attractiveness Atkins Nutritional Approach Obesity Transsexuality Urinary incontinence Boy Scouts of America Gender role Cancer Orgasm Body image Anorexia nervosa Transgender Britney Spears Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Corporate governance Psychotherapy Medicine Clinical depression Prostate cancer Human sexual behavior Inflation Hentai Androgen insensitivity syndrome History of intersex surgery Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Internet troll Dog Barbie Anime Osteoporosis Weight training Psychology Education in Japan Volleyball Gestalt therapy Plastic surgery Puberty Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Democracy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Dieting Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Kylie Minogue Scouting Consciousness Albatross Stroke Neuro-linguistic programming Extreme Programming Sperm Whale Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Abortion debate Open access Objectivist philosophy Aikido Diamond Sexual attraction Milton H.

in what ways are women more stronger than men i have heard of some comments from friends that girls are stronger than boys can t figure out in what ways surely there must be a very wide range of studies for that men are more stronger than women physically but not necessarily mentally women tend to be more emotionally stable and secure in that way as for career wise this is very complicated because it depends on the individual possibly men are more career minded than women but it s an ongoing observation when you talk about males and females genders just let me clarify one thing and make it clear with what you actually mean the way you act according to your gender is infact a direct result of the variable levels of sex hormones in your body for a normal male there would be high levels of testesterone ensuring he maintains his masculinity because the gender code is xy for all males there is an amount of oestrogen present also for a normal female the gender code being xx means that there is a high level of oestrogen and no testesterone these hormones influence the way we all act and in this very world which has so many complicated different issues which have to be assessed inorder to fully determine who s stronger between the two genders you cannot expect to find an accurate result in the end the point is it has to be assessed on an individual case study preferably between a couple living together sometimes women can be weaker than men in the emotional side but most of the time it is the opposite the same applies for career men are mostly business minded women are less in a minority of cases it is just the opposite my point made here both men and women have equal abilities even if they do not necessarily have to be the same in each case so physically stronger are men and emotionally stronger are women just to keep matters as simple as possible  Gender role Sexual orientation Transsexuality Biology and sexual orientation Sexual differentiation Homosexuality and transgender Gender-neutral language Gender identity Androgen insensitivity syndrome History of intersex surgery Pedophilia Sex Transgender Turner syndrome Economic inequality Infantilism Gender Intelligence quotient Homosexuality Sexual attraction Puberty Intersexuality Gender identity disorder Sex assignment Hormone replacement therapy (trans) ELO rating system Sex and intelligence Prostate cancer Consensus decision-making Heteronormativity Autism Effeminacy Domestic violence Human Divorce Twin Breastfeeding Age of consent Homophobia Addiction Reparative therapy Abortion debate CPU cache Ethics Hormone replacement therapy Orgasm Intersex surgery Legal aspects of transsexualism Microeconomics Abortion Asperger syndrome Child sexual abuse Second language acquisition Social psychology Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Scientology beliefs and practices Child sexuality Asian fetish Causality Leadership Bisexuality Gay Determinism Bulgarian language Affirmative action Social rule Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Man God and gender Nutrition Capitalism Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Cognitive science Physical attractiveness John Money Mathematics Zoophilia Species English grammar Labour economics Fathers' rights Carl Jung Aikido Psychology Urinary incontinence Homosexuality and Christianity Salic law Obsessive-compulsive disorder Normal distribution Philosophy of science Rape Quantum mechanics

why are so many women always raging against generalizations isnt it far more silly to cite the exception to the rule as a reaction i mean seriously i spoke about how women are reluctand to be the provider for a man and got accused of generalizing because somone knew somebody who but what are the chances for a man who has the intention to become a houseman to find a wife that can and will provide for him in maybe in is still too generous so do as all a favour and quit using the white flies to speak out against the mainstream actually i aint looking for that kind of woman and iam pretty sure men who are have pretty slim chances actually it was more how about some people try to topple the rule by citing an exception to the rule and of course screaming like a banshee about generalizations not so much about the example at hand there's no way of knowing the answer to your question without doing actual research into the subject and i'd be very hesitant to agree with your assumption about people's working lives today without actual proof people go through many changes in their lives and thanks to the gains feminism made in changing the way people work men can now access paternity leave and other 'family friendly' work practices and spend time at home with their children while their partners work and women can do the same people choose to work or not work at different times in their lives in discussion with their partners if you are not having luck in finding a partner who will support you in this way you might be looking in the wrong place try giving some attention to well educated independently minded women you'll have a better chance finding someone to share the load if you consider your partner as just that and not just someone to 'keep' you cheers  Domestic violence Gender role Divorce Theory of conduct Marriage Polygamy Abortion debate Sexual orientation Social rule Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Fathers' rights Plame affair Romulus and Remus Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Homophobia Women in Islam Gender-neutral language Asperger syndrome Biology and sexual orientation Baseball Stars Feminism Democracy Theodicy Epistemology Mojave people Same-sex marriage in Canada W.I.T.C.H.

are you familiar with the different types of feminist theory which are you the term feminist is extremely confused in this category could be because there is not a clear understanding of the different theories i found a site where they explain these differences in a simple way there are different approaches to feminism radical radical libertarian radical cultural liberal socialist cultural and ecofeminism which one describes you better please read at http www colostate edu depts speech rccs theory htm marycheney you said i think there are more types of feminism than that could you please elaborate on this i am really interested hmmm i can't see why one has to pick a 'label' for oneself as a feminist or anything else the only use for that is so someone else can get a handle on your thinking and put you in a box for their convenience for the record i'm probably every one of those types of feminist from time to time and none of them at others all of them have ideas and values i admire and would seek to make part of my life and ideas i don't adhere to one can choose in this as in other things i remember years ago seeing 'environmentalists' described in this type of 'pie chart' way but the environmental movement is a much broader church than half a dozen flip descriptions on a website can encompass and so is feminism cheers  Feminism Postmodernism Civil rights Gender role Left-wing politics Deconstruction Anarchism Conservatism Goodness and value theory Fundamentalism Political economy Intellectual capital Radical feminism Sociology Human Deep ecology Economics Ideology Theology Liberalism worldwide Asperger syndrome Objectivist philosophy Social psychology Culture Green economics Islam as a political movement Animal rights Nationalism Socialist economics Masculism Sex-positive feminism Sexual orientation Literary theory The nature of God in Western theology Strategic management Social movement Taoism American Conservatism Liberal Christianity Neoconservatism in the United States Abortion debate Behaviorism Political spectrum Coercion Entropy Economic anthropology Postmodernity Animism Gender-neutral language Calvinism Criticism of libertarianism Sociocultural evolution Marxism Max Stirner Christian right Analytic philosophy Evangelicalism Lesbian Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Scientology beliefs and practices Max Weber Philosophy A Course In Miracles Logic Extreme Programming Unitarian Universalism American individualist anarchism Socrates Louis Althusser Franz Boas Existentialism Creationism Moral Politics Meaning Left-Right politics Property (ownership right) Critical theory God and gender Green politics Right-wing politics Feminist movement Mathematics Political correctness War Worldwide green parties Maurice Merleau-Ponty Chinese language Globalization

a long personal question for women need your opinion suppose you were a big fan of a musical band there were two main stars in this band the lead singer the keyboard player both of them are brothers the singer is a tall and handsome guy and he sings with so much passion that gets cheers from all the fans and you are like totally attracted to him eventually by virtue of luck you both meet and go out on a date you get to know that not only is he the lead singer but also the music composer lyricist wow the chemistry between you two is increased tenfold you both are deeply in love with each other and pursue a serious relationship now this guy's brother the keyboard player is kinda ugly and a bit fat but a very good guy at heart it turns out that he actually has deep feelings for you but once he knew that you and his brother were dating he is heartbroken but makes a mature decision not to see you or get involved in your matters but one day by chance you meet this brother say hi strike up a friendly conversation he is immensely delighted to meet and spend time with you he expresses how happy he is to know that you and his brother are together you both have an enjoyable conversation until all of a sudden you get shocking news the main person responsible for the working success of the band was not your bf but the brother the brother was the guy who composed all the songs wrote the lyrics even arranged the vocalist for the songs your bf didn t do anything you thought he was the singer of the band but you were wrong founded you bf had very poor quality of voice so he was merely lip syncing with the vocalist behind the scenes but you couldn t make out the difference because the sounds were synthesized the music was so good that you were absorbed in the enjoyment the reason your bf was even in the band in the first place is because he was his brother you initially doubted the brother but after he proved everything to you you came to the realization your bf is a cheat he just lied to you about himself being so great just because he wanted to love you and needless to say the brother is heart stricken with disappointment as well in this situation what would you do next dump your boyfriend immediately because he lied to you then get away from both of them calm down and still stick with your bf realizing it s too late you have already given your heart away to him dump your boyfriend immediately but after a period of time start dating his brother as he is very talented and good natured both brothers are liars not just the singer one can lie passively as well as actively and the ugly brother is also living a lie i would have nothing to do with either brother because the whole situation is very likely to end badly best wishes  Blood on the Tracks EastEnders The Ashlee Simpson Show One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Roxette The Band ABBA Queen (band) W.I.T.C.H.

failures of first wave feminism the one that occured from the end of 's to beginning of 's why did it fail do you mean the answer is it most certainly didn't so many changes in the laws of england wales and scotland occured because of the campaigning of women on behalf of women for instance josephine butler campaigned tirelessly to have the age of consent raised so that young working class girls could be protected from a life of prostitution this brand of feminism is of course different from other kinds that followed but is feminism nonetheless albeit moralist in nature this goes for the women who campaigned in victorian times to end pornography as well our views have since changed on these issues and we are now more interested in freedom of choice nonetheless female activists of the time contributed to the way things are today  Sex-positive feminism Abortion debate Victorian era Age of consent Prostitution Animal rights Feminist movement Human sexual behavior Josephine Butler Andrea Dworkin Separation of church and state Mary Wollstonecraft Child pornography Civil rights Gender role Ethics Feminists for Life The Handmaid's Tale Consensual crime Pornography Lawrence v.

for women to have orgasm okey from my understanding women normally have sex with men she trusts and loves and emotionally attached and for women to really enjoy sex and be able to cum she has to love the men and be emotionally attached to him but i know that doesnt apply to all women as some women women in porn industry nymphomaniacs whores skanks prostitute might be able to cum even if she is not doing it with someone she loves or emotionally attached to is that correct or does it have to do with experience like if women have tons of sex she is able to have an orgasm with a guy who shes not in love with etc also do women who have alot of sex like nymphomaniacs and prostitutes become sorta male like increase in thier male hormone or loose thier feminity in some way i didnt say all women who have sex without emotional attachment or love are whores i said some women so read it carefully delicious if you could cum without being emotionally attached to the person ur having sex with i dont know what makes you so think about that maybe a robot rebel yell you said sex is better with someone you love for both male and female well i will have to disagree with you on this one as some men prefer having wilder creazier sex sometimes not all the time you cant speak for em and i asked if women have alot of sex do they tend to lose faminity because i heard women working at brothel some women there are less feminity and i always wondered about that i dont understand why i am getting angry emotional responses i am first off female and very experienced in sex yes women can cum by having sex with someone who is not emotionally attached to just like there are people who have sex with objects animals people you name it but we are talking about the norms the natural prefered way the way god had created us i dislike the trend of where women take sexually liberated role such as sex and the city girls gone wild all these sex tapes promote very dangerous also wrong ideas to our women in our generation that are confused than ever we do not have to give them guilt trip but make sure they understand sex were not supposed to be about recretional fun exercise where we could do it with someone whom you are not emotionaly attached to i think this is where women get brainwashed because now they feel less inhibited i had to make mistakes on my own to understand my own sexuality and learn about sex but we should not give out these confused women sex can be this and that i guess i regret doing it too fast for my age cuz sex was what were talked about the most by your so called sexually liberated females i regret so much having sex with the men i never loved and much more sexually experienced than i was because of that i was mistaken love with sex when i shouldve learned about love first i guess i am such a sensitive one and perhaps blame myself but i just think some of these sexually liberated women talking about sex with no emotional attachment or love might be the most confused one of all and probably the product of male brainwashing holy crap i wish i could really swear on here because you really take the chauvinistic ignorant moron cake here buddy women can cum if their idiot men know what they're doing they don't need to be attached in any way to do so although granted it is better if they do and as for the hookers and porn hey boy ever heard of faking it my god where the hell have you been i'll give you a buck for every hooker who ever had a real orgasm with a john and even though i'm between jobs right now i'd still have enough left in the bank for next months rent men are sometimes so pushy for sex that many women will have sex with them just to shut them up this does not mean that they enjoy it at all let alone cum apparently centuries of being told what to do and beaten if you didn't is a hard habit to break i'm not saying women are easy either so don't bother reading into that the men may be thinking sluts but the women know what i'm talking about we've all been there of course sex is preferred with love over none women are emotional creatures and men are emotional morons they use women even if they claim they don't i find that the men who claim they dont' use women for sex have developed their personality so that it appeals to the emotional side of a women to further sway them into deciding to have sex with the guy who's sweet talking her it's all a game to them and do men become more feminine if they have a lot of sex holy crap were you sick with the measels the week of sex ed at your school anyone will tell you that women of a brothel are anything but manly if anything they are exaggertatingly female it's better for business because that's what it is and the orgasms are fake bought and paid for and like i said yes a woman can cum with someone she's not attached to it depends mostly on her own self confidence level of desire and skill of her lover gee just like a man's  Orgasm Avenue Q Prostitution Sexual

if i were trapped and sinking in quicksand what would you do i would toss a rope to you and help pull you out here is a good description of quicksand and rescue the idea that a person can be sucked into quicksand is a complete myth quicksand is formed when an upward flow of water generally from an underground spring is of sufficient pressure to counteract the weight of the soil grains when this happens the individual grains are not held together and they are unable to support any weight through the physical interaction of the grains bearing on each other there is no suction force associated with quicksand if there were it would draw the soil grains more tightly together and actually make the ground harder consequently it is literally impossible for a person to be sucked screaming into quicksand and disappear leaving only a floating pith helmet as is so popular in the movies in fact since humans are made mostly of water the specific gravity of the sand water mix is substantially higher than the human body so a person walking into quicksand would sink to about waist depth then float it should be a simple matter to paddle one's way back to more solid ground the screaming would be optional  Quicksand Tide Bong Equine conformation Bladderwort Naval mine Professional wrestling holds Phase (matter) Weightlessness Flood geology Suction Sewage treatment Gravity Happy Tree Friends Casting Naruto jutsu Water Internal ballistics Carburetor Drowning Root Professional wrestling throws Siphon Aerial (dance move) Soil mechanics Vacuum Dry quicksand Gold standard Canoe Water (molecule) Burial Table tennis Supernova Geology of the Moon RMS Titanic Avalanche Thermal power station Seismic retrofit Golf Vacuum cleaner Trapping Suspension bridge Volleyball Ecology Suicide methods Car handling Breastfeeding Aquifer Fire fighting Dredge Water purification Buoyancy Archimedes Weight training Glossary of climbing terms Sailing Carbon dioxide sink Glossary of American football Carnivorous plant Hemp Strap-on dildo Glacier Oceanic trench Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Wood Plate tectonics Sea-Monkey Causality Nuclear fallout The Dalek Invasion of Earth Leather Diamond Diver rescue Fishing Drill bit Knife Force Swimming Glossary of firefighting equipment Mattress Hydroponics War of the Worlds (2005 film) Armored Core Borehole Scuba set Plough Canal lock Soil Imperial Guard (Warhammer 40,000 army) Rocket fuel Friedrich Schleiermacher Lake Porosity Waterworld

an y feminists who support porn visual erotica many people think porn sexuality and feminism can't go hand in hand i'm a feminist who likes porn for my own gratification turn ons and it serves as a good warm up with a significant other i don't watch porn to to give in to a man's needs or to put women down i do it because it's my choice i enjoy my sexuality and i feel that porn visual erotica isn't only for men after all feminism is originally about choice and defying gender expectations why should i live up the stereotype that women shouldn't look at porn or be sexual and why should i believe that women are surrendering to men in the sex industry hello we females have sex and get naked because we like it get over it as long as nobody is being forced or harmed i'm okay with women choosing to enter the sex industry in a way porn actresses and strippers are in a position of power and are exerting control over male viewers jhmsi i'm with you that i like visual stimuli i'm not into reading romantic stories to sexually turn me on like how women are stereotyped to be romance is definitely sweet but porn not the disgusting out there kind is fun also well simone i go to strip clubs with my boyfriend lol i'm not bisexual but i enjoy it for some reason strippers say they enjoy giving lap dances to couples and they pay more attention to the girl kris j yes the cons of porn are the beauty ideals but i personally was rational enough to not let that affect me amateur porn erotica features normal looking girls many have medium to small breasts i agree with you i'm a feminist and an iconoclast and a libertine and an atheist and a liberal and an omnisexual and so much more too and i find visual stimulation simply wonderful now that could be because of my voyeuristic tendencies but i just find pornography sexually satisfying of course i personally love the hardcore yaoi stuff the most but hey that's pretty obvious given my avatar i'm just one of those people who derives pleasure from visual physical sex as well as personal fantasies that's just how i am and other girls can go oh making love is so much more meaningful than just having casual sex and watching porn is nasty all they want but i prefer to not be a hypocrite  Gender role Pornography Striptease Bondage (BDSM) Sadism and masochism Pedophilia Hentai Pornographic movie Group sex Child pornography Bisexuality Human sexuality Transsexuality Sexual orientation Pornography in Japan Lesbian Gay slang Feminism Infantilism Nudity Bish__jo game Gender Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Masturbation Sex in science fiction Oral sex Sexual revolution Pornographic actor Zoophilia Prostitution Homosexuality History of sex Little Britain Paraphilia John Holmes (actor) Child sexuality Androgen insensitivity syndrome Friends Gender-neutral language BDSM Sex and the City Erotica AVN Awards Slash fiction Transgender Strap-on dildo Biology and sexual orientation Madonna (entertainer) Homosexuality and Christianity Fan fiction Homophobia Boogie Nights Orgasm Motion picture rating system Sexual attraction Domestic violence God and gender Sento Anal sex Annabel Chong Andrea Dworkin Drag queen Anime Polyamory Homosexuality and transgender Gay pornography Effeminacy Media and ethnicity Pornography addiction Love Religion and sexuality Great Teacher Onizuka LaVeyan Satanism Sexuality in Christian demonology Avenue Q Sinfest Casual relationship Physical attractiveness The Country Wife Humphrey Bogart Serial killer Gay Cardcaptor Sakura The 120 Days of Sodom History of intersex surgery Sex toy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Narcissism Sexism Women in Islam Feminist movement Sin City Sex

why do so many people think that citing exceptions refutes a generalization by definition a generalization predicts exceptions for instance the generalization men are taller than women knows that all men are not taller than all women no doubt this generalization is easily accepted because height is not really considered a virtue it seems that people say stop generalizing in order to avoid something they find uncomfortable but if a general statement is uncomfortable that doesn't stop it being true i'm talking about truth in the statistical sense of course logically the only thing that matters about a generalization is its accuracy not its implications but it seems that many people base their reasoning on what they hope is true and therefore resort to such fallacies to dismiss arguments they don't like so this is two questions really why do people think that calling a statement a generalization disproves that statement and why do people think that a generalization is disproved once exceptions are shown something awesome you may have whatever feelings you want to have you're making the fallacy i referred to earlier your argument is based on consequence rather than truth object of its ire everything you have said is irrelevant to what i said can't you see that or are you being deliberately obstructive i'm talking about how people think they can disprove a generalization by showing exceptions or by simply shouting generalization from your failure to address the question s asked how often you changed your answer and its incorrectness and length i'm guessing your the latest version of lekmich can you keep an account for longer than a minute of course your identity doesn't mean anything to the discussion i'm simply curious are you a lunatic or just a piss taker i'm sure you're a nutter but i don't deny that your online persona could be an elaborate joke it's called the rule of the exception flaw in critical thinking for example despite statistically lowering fatalities seat belt usage is frequently dismissed with the rule of exception but my aunt's neighbor's son in law once was thrown out of his car that burned and if he had been wearing his seat belt he would have died therefore based on that one exception or the minority statistical proportion seat belts are unsafe there is no further point in trying to explain the basis of odds with people who have not advanced beyond this unsophisticated stage of cognition as a nurse i wasted probably years of my life in total time tying to educate people who could not understand the flaw in exceptionary rationale  Atheism Philosophy of language Epistemology Scientific method Philosophy of science Plame affair G__del's incompleteness theorem Intelligent design Internet troll Logical fallacy Goodness and value theory Existence of God Abortion debate Fallacy Resurrection of Jesus Philosophy of mathematics Presuppositional apologetics Utilitarianism Free will Theory Theodicy Economics Biblical inerrancy Ethics Philosophical skepticism Deconstruction Agnosticism Meaning of life Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Vacuous truth Doomsday argument Religion Ad hominem Strong atheism Contract Ontological argument Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an English grammar Bayesian inference Conspiracy theory Creationist cosmologies Artificial consciousness David Hume Causality Pseudoscience Fundamentalism Karl Popper Begging the question Augustus De Morgan Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Evolutionary creationism Phaedo Two Dogmas of Empiricism Traumatic incident reduction The nature of God in Western theology Paradox Philosophy of space and time Extreme Programming Gender-neutral language Reality Intelligent design movement Bertrand Russell A Course In Miracles Creationism Microeconomics Determinism Socrates Democracy Truth Faith and rationality Critical thinking Objectivist philosophy Peter Singer Cosmological argument George Edward Moore Critique of Pure Reason Coercion Abiogenesis Naturalistic fallacy Human Many-worlds interpretation Supernatural GED Sexual orientation Transcendental argument for the existence of God Psychology Soul Bah__'__ Faith and Science Complexity classes P and NP

feminists do you think it would be unfair of me to do this details i have employers bob and joe joe asks me for weeks app months of paid leave for him to travel around the world since he is a valuable employee i grant him his wish at the same time bob asks me for weeks of paid paternity leave i'm in a good day and i accept upon bob's return he asks me for a raise i deny him and tell him that if he works constantly for weeks double the time he took off and put in extra hour everyday for weeks and weeks only to help make up for his weeks of paid paternity leave i'll give him a year raise a couple months later joe returns from his world travels he also asks me for a raise i deny him and tell him that if he works constantly for weeks again double the time and puts in extra hours a day for those weeks and only that time period to help compensate for his leave i'll give him a raise am i being unfair to one of my employers here after the time period weeks and weeks alternatively is up is up they do not have to work extra hour a day any more i don't care if it's harsh or not the extra hour a day is with pay ok here is the question am i being unfair of one employer over another am i giving joe a better deal than bob or vise versa weeks is a lot of time it is the equivalent of around months i don't work at mcdonald's but this is a hypothetical situation and yes i have the right to refuse an employer p maternity leave my parents own a small business i would know first of all i am unsure about why this is a question addressed to feminists i can only guess that you are comparing the leave you give to bob to maternity leave federal law mandates that an employee with certain restrictions on the employer and employee must be given weeks of unpaid leave under certain situations with the birth of a child being one of them that is generally referred to as maternity leave for women and paternity leave for men it is up to the employer's discretion if they want to make that paid leave or keep it as it is mandated by law which is unpaid since in your scenario you choose to give both employees paid leave and since you demand exactly the same thing from both of them for them to get a raise i e working twice the amount of time they were gone with one extra hour a day then no i don't think it is unfair it does seem a bit harsh as that extra hour really adds up but it is not fundamentally unfair as both are being treated in exactly the same manner i would think it unfair if you gave bob unpaid leave and then demanded he work the extra time in order to get a raise simply because then you would not be holding all of your employees to the same standard if working extra hours is how you intend to judge an employee's worthiness to receive a pay raise then that is your privilege i would simply add that bob does not need to catch you on a good day to get his leave you have to give it to him by law what does depend on your mood is whether or not he is paid during that time i would also add that if you give joe paid leave but give bob unpaid leave you are opening yourself up for a lawsuit for discriminating against bob as i stated before if you treat all your employees in exactly the same manner meaning everyone either gets paid leave or everyone gets unpaid leave and if you give everyone their jobs back and you demand the same thing from everyone in order for them to earn a raise then that does not seem unfair to me harsh yes unfair no i don't see that you are favoring one above the other in any way since your demands are in exchange for their previous request to negotiate a new salary  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Labor theory of value Social rule Economic inequality Poker jargon Microeconomics Unemployment Conscription Same-sex marriage Social Security (United States) Divorce Article One of the United States Constitution Labor-power Theory of conduct Insurance Child support Contract Appeal Member of the European Parliament Working time Unemployment benefit Civil rights Minimum wage Fathers' rights Compensation of employees Estoppel Betting (poker) Wheel of Fortune Extreme Programming Transsexuality Breastfeeding Plame affair Winter of Discontent Family name SCO-Linux controversies CPU cache Affirmative action Roe v.

what is right about this ohio bill abortion law gives fathers a say but opponents blast bill as 'extreme' as written the ohio bill would ban women from seeking an abortion without written consent from the father of the fetus in cases where the identity of the father is unknown women would be required to submit a list of possible fathers the physician would be forced to conduct a paternity test from the provided list and then seek paternal permission to abort simply put no father means no abortion in addition women would be required to present a police report in order to prove a pregnancy is the result of rape or incest with the proposal men would be guaranteed that voice under penalty of law first time violators would by tried for abortion fraud a first degree misdemeanor the same would be the case for men who falsely claim to be fathers and for medical workers who knowingly perform an abortion without paternal consent http www recordpub com news article what is right about this bill what if you didn't want to file a rape or incest report with the police wow one of you thinks if a woman is raped and is too afraid to go to the police she deserves to have the rapists child because she is afraid so the woman is suppose to be punished twice for being raped whew harsh very harsh hope someone who care about isn't raped and afraid no sympathy from you eh and the same poster thinks women should have their children taken away from them since they shouldn't be raised by a whore hmm just who would be eligible to raise the child if you made both men and women adhere to your standards how many couples are going to be found who will be eligible to adopt would they both have to be virgins to adopt can they each have had one partner and be allowed to adopt who decides what is a whore or whoremonger i see a lot of statements blaming the woman for having unprotected sex what about the man that had unprotected sex with her where is his responsibility why aren't they being vilified for creating this fetus too if what you say is correct i would not expect this bill to ever pass if it did it would almost certainly never go into effect under the current case law while parental consent is required for minors the requirement for parental consent is based on the general rule that minors are unable to give informed consent to any medical procedure for an adult woman it is permitted to impose requirements designed to assure that her consent to an abortion is an informed consent it is not permitted to give another person a veto over the decision to have an abortion if this bill were enacted it would put justice kennedy on the spot and to a lesser extent chief justice roberts and justice alito justice kennedy has said that it is unconstitutional to impose a substantial burden on a woman having an abortion this bill looks like a substantial burden to me chief justice roberts and justice alito promised the senate that they did not have any agenda on this issue this bill would put the continued viability of roe v wade dead set at the heart of the case  Planned Parenthood v.

why become a pharmacist if you don't want to dispense drugs pharmacists have sued washington state over a new regulation that requires them to sell emergency contraception also known as the morning after pill under the new state rule pharmacists with personal objections to a drug can opt out by getting a co worker to fill an order but that applies only if the patient is able to get the prescription in the same pharmacy visit sold as plan b emergency contraception is a high dose of the drug found in many regular birth control pills it can lower the risk of pregnancy by as much as percent if taken within hours of unprotected sex the federal food and drug administration made the morning after pill available without prescription to adults last year why become a pharmacist if you don't want to dispense drugs many pharmacists also refuse to dispense prescription birth control pills and over the counter forms of birth control http www allheadlinenews com articles http www washingtonpost com ac wp dyn a mar language printer ok so using your logic that anyone should be able to follow their conscience so if i'm a religious pharmacist like many of these people say and they don't want to encourage promiscuous sex i could then refuse to sell to unmarried men in addition to unmarried women any form of birth control including condoms this is happening to women right now i could refuse to sell to any single man any form of erectile dysfunction drugs pumps creams or lotions i could refuse to sell to any unmarried man or woman anything that could be used to contribute to a sexual act taking place also if i'm a christian scientist who is a pharmacist paramedic or a doctor then i could refuse to sell insulin inhalers and oxygen since these all items artificially prolong life which is against my religious beliefs actually i've quit a few high paying jobs because i didn't like what was going on i've refused to do things i thought was unethical quite a few times can you say the same money talks for most people all i know is that these same so called moral pharmacists usually have no problem filling out prescriptions for viagra no problem helping men have sex but god forbid a woman wants to have sex without creating a child what these people don't understand is that by refusing sell plan b you're not saving any lives you're only creating more abortions of course common sense is not usually apparent to moral crusaders  Oral contraceptive Medical prescription Sexual intercourse Sex education Abortion debate Fertility awareness Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sexual abstinence Condom Religion and sexuality Pharmacist Methamphetamine Food and Drug Administration Marriage Sildenafil Controlled Substances Act Psoriasis Abortion Human sexual behavior Roman Catholic Church Roe v.

why are companies increasing their discrimination against women in pay and promotion i often hear on this forum that no gender pay discrimination exists in the us a couple of federal judges differ with your opinion a federal judge has ruled that female drug sales workers for novartis pharmaceuticals may proceed with a class action gender discrimination lawsuit against the company the women claim the company discriminated against them in pay promotions and personnel evaluations sometimes because they were pregnant or had recently given birth pregnancy discrimination is prohibited by a federal law enacted in complaints to the government about such discrimination are increasing to last year up from in according to the federal equal employment opportunity commission here's the new york times article judge allows class action bias suit against novartis http www nytimes com business cnd suit html ex en d b ei partner rssnyt emc rss three of the novartis plaintiffs as well as others who submitted affidavits said that women who became pregnant suffered a variety of poor treatment including arbitrary discipline denial of promotions and termination of employment many attest to specific comments by managers indicating a hostility to pregnancy judge lynch wrote in his opinion one woman testified that her manager said he preferred not to hire young females stating first comes love then come marriage then comes flex time and a baby carriage another manager allegedly encouraged a young woman to get an abortion yet another woman alleges that employees were urged during a training session to avoid pregnancy the declarant five months pregnant at the time drew the eye of the trainer who said oops too late judge lynch wrote in his opinion if you'd bothered to read the article it mentioned another recent law suit being filed against walmart involving million women for gender wage discrimination david w sanford the lawyer for the women said he believed the case was the second largest gender discrimination case certified as a class next to a case against wal mart the wal mart case which alleges discrimination in pay and job classification and is pending in federal court in northern california involves an estimated million women who have worked for wal mart since so the logic of quite a few of you is since women get pregnant women should be refused employment since they are a woman and could become pregnant maybe you'd prefer women got their tubes tied before filling out a job application would that be sufficient so a woman could not be denied employment because of her gender or denied raises or promotions is she still allowed to marry or have a step child would that interfere so if a man is a widower should he be fired since he will now be a drain on the company like a woman would be if you assume women are always the primary caretaker or would he have to marry so if a woman hires a nanny why does she have to worry about hiring promotions or pay raises if she's not taking time off then what is the excuse for how she is being paid and promoted managers are hostile toward pregnancy b c it takes a trained employee away from her fr king job this is not a gender issue yes this is a gender issue since women are the ones who get pregnant and if fathers did their share of the infant care child care nanny care sick child days child special events then time away from work wouldn't be a woman issue it would be a parent issue a common human issue so i agree this is a human issue but since some men say their jobs are more important than their wives jobs or say they make more money than their wives jobs or say that it is the mother's other job to be the primary child caretaker instead of being a shared parental responsibility instead of being a human issue parental duties have been made by society corporations business families and churches into a woman's issue if men would take equal responsibility for the childcare of their children and stood up for their parental rights then employers would listen it is difficult to prove employment and salary wage discrimination since most people are threatened with being fired if they discuss their salary with anyone plus nearly every company hides their pay rates and pay scales if sexual discrimination cases are increasing it must be pretty blatant to have been found the evidence has to be overwhelming before most judges will allow a case to move forward in addition since the reagon era enforcement of pay equity has not been a top priority the pay equity law has been in place since since women are the only ones that can have children you can think of the matter like you do that these women are being given a special privilege by law which men are not given and is not in the best interests of business well we could change that tube tie all the women make sure men are sterile have test tube babies then neither gender has to have kids and we can get rid of laws that only apply to one gender we must be cautious as this case hasn't ended yet as the article says a federal judge has ruled that female drug sales workers for novartis pharmaceuticals may proceed with a class action gender discrimination lawsuit against the company this only means that the court shall hear the workers' case and not that it has ruled in favor of the workers secondly it is absolutely possible that this company has discriminated against these women based upon their pregnancy status however in the fourth paragraph of the article it is stated a statistical analysis the plaintiffs submitted to judge lynch concluded that women were paid about less a month than men in similar jobs a figure that they say does not include pay disparities due to promotions if i were the judge i would want to know what they mean by similar jobs i e why didn't they study the same jobs it would also be interesting to see how many pregnant women or women that have recently given birth have been promoted and compare those numbers with women who were pregnant or recently gave birth who did not recieve a promotion it would also be interesting to note whether or not that less a month is statistically significant if not then the workers have less of a case though they still can have one it would also be interesting to see the other reasons why these women feel that they were discriminated against in the article it states the women claim the company discriminated against them in pay promotions and personnel evaluations sometimes because they were pregnant or had recently given birth lastly the things said to these women if found to be true in court are unprofessional and should be punished thirdly just because complaints to the government have risen doesn't mean that all those complaints are valid ones i would want to know how many of those complaints were later found to be invalid stats are only as good as what you compare them to in the final analysis just because somebody brings a claim of discrimination against a company doesn't automatically make the company guilty the gender of the accuser also doesn't make the claim true the facts of the case ought to be the only thing the judge uses to determine the truth this judge seems to feel that the women have enough evidence to proceed if so then it is her his court to do with as he she pleases within the confines of the law i think that the public at large would be better served if the workers' evidence as well as the companies evidence were both made public as soon as possible as a final comment gender pay gap studies as far as i can tell are not the sort of studies that can show causation these studies do show that women make less than men however they are correlational this means that nobody can draw a causal conclusion from them and hope for their hypothesis to be logical in essence it doesn't matter what one federal judge or a million federal judges think the number of people believing in something won't make that something true it is whether or not that idea concept conforms to the reality of the world

gender as a social construct and the pythagorean table of opposites why do people still believe this malarkey that men are the total opposite of women for example that men are logical and women are emotional men are strong and women are weak do you find this just tends to perpetuate gender as a social construct your opinion in my opinion besides the obvious physical differences between men and women we are less opposites than what it has been taught for centuries the only way of one group to have supremacy towards another is by enhancing differences that exist and invent where there are none for example there is a great book called the mismeasure of man by stephen jay gould where he adresses all kind of absurd measurement made in the past by scientists to prove the inferiority of other races same thing has happened through centuries with women it is obvious that if women were not allowed to study but just learn to play the piano and crochet that they perhaps had not the proper tools to debate with a philosopher of those times nevertheless today things have changed and now those differences are shrinking as men and women have the same opportunities to learn and work but old ideas are stubborn and change of ideologies slow also some religions still carry the same patriarchal ideas about the differences between the powerful and the weaker sex your question would need a whole essay as i think there are many branches which help to perpetuate this false gender construct from religion to ancient cultural traditions also based in religion on the other hand we also touch false notions of what is to be intelligent as if an emotional person is not intelligent lately it has been extensively written about emotional intelligence and also about that an aggressive person is not necessary an alpha person but more the person that is able to adapt to circumstances these assumed differences are perhaps also because we see the other as an alien as if there were no empathy and the superficial differences make this gap still deeper i don't know why it comes to my mind one of the early medicine experiments doctors used to open live dogs for their experiments because they thought they could not feel pain as in wars the enemy is dehumanized and women through centuries have been considered also less than human the construction of the alien so it is easier to have the upper hand i don't know if i am making sense as it is very late here but this is a fascinating question that take us to many many different roads  Gender role Sexual orientation The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Homophobia Philosophy of language Human Simone Weil Stephen Jay Gould Philosophy of mathematics Sociocultural evolution Social psychology The Mismeasure of Man Franz Boas Bertrand Russell Feminism Atheism Coercion Scientific method Transsexuality Religion Atomism Intelligent design Motivation Culture Creationism Patriotism Psychology Neuro-linguistic programming Plato Human sexual behavior Friedrich Schleiermacher Meaning of life Objectivist philosophy Postmodernism Gender-neutral language Artificial consciousness Race and intelligence (Public controversy) Soul Intelligence (trait) Goodness and value theory Metaphysics Sigmund Freud Narcissism Empathy Confucianism God and gender Carl Jung Gender identity Victor Cousin Meme Theodicy New Age Asperger syndrome Ethics Philosophy Scientology beliefs and practices Chinese language A Course In Miracles History of creationism Economic inequality Race and intelligence Aesthetic Realism God Claude L__vi-Strauss G__del's incompleteness theorem Logic Hypnosis Western philosophy Social justice Consciousness Nature versus nurture Deconstruction Eugenics Anthroposophy Milton H.

do very attractive women end up with the worst men in the end lets face it very attractive women get so much attention that they often have no relationship skills they often have a twisted idea of what a good man is and often ignore quality men and chase lower quality men so they spend their prime between age and chasing and dating toxic men and by the time their looks fade and they realize what a quality man is they are often too damaged to be a quality partner so i think the average looking women actually have it best they get quality men and have normal egos which lead to better personality and social skills then their highly attractive counterparts the only reason i didn't like dating unattractive guys is because they have such a low self esteem and not to mention they get cocky if you date them and next thing you know they think that you are so fortunate to be dating them poor thing i date one once and i dumped him i don't like arrogant males and he was becoming so arrogant but good looking males on the other hand have always treated me like a princess so not all females end up with worst in the end the same must be for the men  Physical attractiveness Human height Rei Ayanami Humphrey Bogart Asperger syndrome Anal sex Transgender Sub-Zero Laserdisc Interracial couple Dilbert Asian fetish Sexual attraction Friends Little Britain Gender role Social rule Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Baldness Gay slang Summa Theologiae Ranma __ characters Age of consent Plame affair EastEnders Samurai Deeper Kyo Daredevil Sexual orientation Angel (vampire) Something Positive Poker jargon Sin City Charmed Theodicy Harem anime Kim Possible Conscription About a Boy Microeconomics Garfield Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an George Costanza Fighting Spirit Economic inequality Bisexuality Dragons (Pern) Seinfeld Homosexuality and transgender Urinary incontinence Ephebophilia Pride and Prejudice Infantilism Team Fortress Classic Swingout Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) Spider-Man 2 Homophobia Child sexual abuse Final Fantasy XI Sigmund Freud Drawn Together Hearing impairment Xiaolin Showdown Memento (film) Domestic violence Fable (video game) Sheepshead The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Age disparity in sexual relationships Feminism History of sex Supergirl Characters in the Smurfs Woman Calvin and Hobbes Internet troll Leadership Fancy Crane Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Folic acid Guan Yu Galactic Civilizations Microcredit Self-esteem Autism Boston Public Days of our Lives Heteronormativity Hey Jude New Testament Ayra (Fire Emblem) Archie Comics The Fairly OddParents The Legend of Zelda series characters Maison Ikkoku Norway national football team Buffy Summers

aren't christians somewhat enlightened not because of but in spite of their religion while some more closed religions still enforce women's suppression with extreme brutality i find christianity oppresses women enormously right down to not allowing women to become priests in the roman catholic religion because st thomas aquinas thought women to be incomplete males males missing limbs were also not allowed to be ordained at the time the bible was interpreted by male scholars at a time when women were considered property and thus the bible was interpreted the same way even god was made into a male pronoun when in fact the original writings spoke of the divine being as an 'it this just further enforced that women were considered to be less than the original story of creation in genesis also blamed women for all the sins of the world when in fact the original scripture said nothing of the sort at the time of jesus the christ women were central characters and as each year passed after his death women became more marginalized and less a part of the original doctrine when in fact jesus the christ's best friends were mary and martha and mary of magdalene was the one who was chosen to spread the word of his resurrection which is what the entire belief of christianity is based on mary of magdalene was even painted to be a prostitute to further tarnish her reputation and once again put women into secondary roles  Resurrection of Jesus Abrahamic religion New Testament Mary Magdalene Mary, the mother of Jesus Christianity Sin Catholicism Roman Catholic Church Eastern Orthodox Church Idolatry Baptism History of Christianity Criticisms of Christianity Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Divine grace Church of Christ Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Creationism John Wycliffe God Church of Christ, Scientist Baptist Theology Christian apologetics Angel Eucharist Heresy Fundamentalism Trinity Gospel Christian Gospel of Thomas Sabbath Biblical inerrancy Holy Spirit Immaculate Conception Gnosticism Moses Protestantism Christ Judaism Jehovah's Witnesses Religious perspectives on Jesus Origen Christian anarchism Christian views of Jesus Homosexuality and Christianity Lutheranism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Book of Mormon Prophet Celtic Christianity Nontrinitarianism The Da Vinci Code Predestination Apologetics Separation of church and state Thomas (Apostle) Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Ten Commandments Apocrypha Evangelicalism God and gender Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Heaven Opus Dei Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod Coptic Christianity Devil Genesis Binitarianism Anglicanism Second Vatican Council Icon Clergy George Fox Curse and mark of Cain Religious conversion Miracle Historical Jesus Documentary hypothesis Paul of Tarsus Salvation Holy Orders Mormonism and Judaism Religious pluralism

do women need men more than men need women ok for the sake of argument lets take reproduction out of the picture and say that humans reproduce asexually without the need for intercourse so women produce more women and men produce more men but women and men don't need to really associate which gender would be more successful at life you have to consider that women need men for protection access to resources jobs etc since men basically build the modern world you also have to take into consideration the fact that men stick together and women treat each other like dog crap what does this say for the argument that men and women are equal i guess the real question here is what would men seek women out for when reproduction is not an issue people keep in mind the actual question this question should be answered based on the situation i described above why are we talking about marriage and successful women i'm not asking about the current situation i m asking if the situation was different and women were not needed for reproduction please read before responding yep women definitely need men more than vice versa many women however have too much foolish pride to admit it how often do you hear a man say he wants a woman to sweep him off his feet it all goes back to the damsel in distress syndrome which is still alive today of women wanting a man to rescue her and bring her to paradise the vast majority of modern commodities women use were invented designed and built by men now how many women will get mad at me now that i've told the truth  Sexual orientation Human sexual behavior Theory of conduct Birth control Same-sex marriage The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Reproduction Fathers' rights Same-sex marriage in Canada Homosexuality and Christianity Animal rights Abortion debate Human Species Divorce Sexual intercourse Theodicy Relations of production Civil rights Human sexuality Feminism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Supernatural Sex Socrates Resurrection of Jesus U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Homosexuality and Judaism Transsexuality Law of value Homophobia Simone Weil Shaggy dog story Autism rights movement Psychology Polygamy Transgender The Amber Spyglass Philosophy of language Killian documents Property (ownership right) Autism Democratic Party (United States) Phaedo Labor theory of value Fictional character Objective-C Novel Game show Commodity markets Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The Death Gate Cycle Humphrey Bogart Roe v.

what is your opinion of this quote by robin morgan regarding the need for feminism and let's put one lie to rest for all time the lie that men are oppressed too by sexism the lie that there can be such a thing as 'men's liberation groups ' oppression is something that one group of people commits against another group specifically because of a 'threatening' characteristic shared by the latter group skin color or sex or age etc the oppressors are indeed fucked up by being masters racism hurts whites sexual stereotypes are harmful to men but those masters are not oppressed any master has the alternative of divesting himself of sexism or racism the oppressed have no alternative for they have no power but to fight in the long run women's liberation will of course free men but in the short run it's going to cost men a lot of privilege which no one gives up willingly or easily sexism is not the fault of women kill your fathers not your mothers source robin morgan goodbye to all that pg kind of an audre lorde thing the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house well i have to say that the overall impression i get from this is that women are helpless and i honestly don't think women want to be perpetuating that particular stereotype i also don't like the last line as mentioned by others there are so many generalizations here that i find it really difficult to swallow any of it the notion that there can be no men's liberation groups bothers me men oppress men some women oppress men and if these men form groups to feel empowered what's the issue there is no way i buy into the stanley fish school of thought which suggests that only whites can be racists which is also what morgan is implying i would have to say that this argument has more negatives than positives and it perpetuates stereotypes feminists have been trying to eliminate imho  Feminism Sexism Homophobia Masculism Sex-positive feminism Radical feminism Racism Asian fetish Gender-neutral language Democracy Black (people) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Affirmative action Gender role Media and ethnicity Simone Weil Homosexuality and transgender Beat generation Coercion Nigger Jews as a chosen people Political correctness Oppression Bertrand Russell God and gender White privilege (sociology) Sexual orientation Speciesism Germaine Greer Alcoholics Anonymous Civil rights Religion and sexual orientation History of South Africa in the apartheid era Orgasm 613 mitzvot Blacks and Mormonism Hate speech Uncle Tom's Cabin Human Reparations for slavery Andrea Dworkin Patriotism Marriage Islam as a political movement Rape Anti-Zionism Franz Boas Paternalism Oral sex Queer Robert A.

are women superior to men i mean in terms of intelligence and stuff i think so women are the shizzle to address your question on a more intellectual level is difficult since it is unclear what you mean by and stuff the intelligence portion of the question is easy to address intelligence is generally defined as a property of mind that encompasses many related abilities such as the capacities to reason plan solve problems think abstractly comprehend ideas and language and learn the main way to measure this scientifically is to take an i q test there are many different i q tests but overall it seems that men and women are generally equal although in a recent study dr paul irwing did find that men score higher on i q tests than do women but this is not a significant difference the fact of the matter is that there are more men on the extreme ends of intelligence that is to say that there are a lot of men in the mentally retarded range and in the genius range more men are in the mentally retarded range for a number of genetic reasons and more men are geniuses for unknown reasons women tend to be more towards the mean this is an interesting difference but i don't think that this takes away from the value of either men or women it's easy to say from personal observation that women are smarter but i think that this is a hasty generalization i don't doubt that both men and women would like to think their gender the superiorly intelligent but the truth is often quite different than what we think  Intelligence (trait) Intelligence quotient Mental retardation Sex and intelligence Autism Psychology Human Affirmative action Scientific method Logic Sexual orientation General intelligence factor Mathematics SAT Turing test Causality Controversies in autism Philosophy of mathematics Eugenics Transsexuality Factor analysis Abortion debate CPU cache Numerology Reason Second language acquisition Gifted Artificial consciousness Stuttering Asperger syndrome Race and intelligence GED Meaning of life Capitalism G__del's incompleteness theorem Economic inequality Scientology beliefs and practices Education in the United States Dyslexia Emotional intelligence Person Central processing unit Species Marilyn vos Savant Rudolf Hermann Lotze Mind Learning disability Free will Mental illness Expert system Theory of multiple intelligences Economics Neil Postman Human brain Whale Deconstruction Epistemology Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Intellectual property Computer Reality Postmodernism Creativity The Mismeasure of Man Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races) Atheism Supernatural Intelligent design movement Theodicy Social rule Theory of conduct The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Electrophysiology Belief revision Gravity Intelligent design Divorce Equal Protection Clause Domestic violence A Course In Miracles Randomness Race and intelligence (Public controversy) Hypoglycemia Genius

can you not be a masculist but still respect and be fair to both men and women i asked a similar question regarding feminism and the majority albeit some with hesitation said you did not need to be a feminist to believe in fairness and respect for both sexes now the reverse question can you decline to align yourself with or refer to yourself as a movement e g feminism or masculism and still be a decent person who does not discriminate or give unfair treatment to people based on their sex masculism is similar to feminism except from the male perspective from dictionary com masculism is viewed by its proponents as having an egalitarian view of gender issues even though it focuses on men's experience egalitarian asserting resulting from or characterized by belief in the equality of all people esp in political economic or social life i should mention that a few feminists insist that by definition it is impossible for a person to not want women to be treated fairly if one is not a feminist i hope that they also answer this question carrie i am assuming t franxius try www dictionary com and let's not bring in what people think of masculism or feminism in that case we would assume they were both hate groups neither have reputations that match their defintions carrie sorry sent the above from my pda and didn't even think it would go through anyway by definition masculism and feminism seem to have similar same goals from different angles and in general neither has a reputation as being fair and reasonable and seeking to respect the other sex so for the sake of this question let's base our conclusions on the the actual definitions rather than the reputations yes you can just like when you're a feminist carrie was koreaguy a right winger he called himself a masculist and was supportive of feminist he seemed like a really fair and mature guy to me chuckwalla is also pretty smart girly is also a feminist and a masculist heck for this question this question only i'll label myself as a masculist and i'm a center syncretic w tt center syncretic right or left d warren farrel used to be on the board of now gotta be a smart left winger for that right  Feminist movement Sexual orientation Gender role Abortion debate Transsexuality Fathers' rights Same-sex marriage Homosexuality and transgender Civil rights Goodness and value theory Transgender Homophobia Political correctness Anarchism Anti-racism Postmodernism Same-sex marriage in Canada Reparative therapy Left-wing politics Libertarianism Transfeminism Domestic violence Sex Biology and sexual orientation Conscription Sex-positive feminism Androgen insensitivity syndrome Animal rights American individualist anarchism History of women in the United States Radical feminism Warren Farrell Woman Theory of conduct Conscription in the United States Affirmative action Orgasm Sigmund Freud Left-Right politics Andrea Dworkin Ethics Economic inequality Religious pluralism Religious Society of Friends Religion Conservatism Human sexual behavior History of intersex surgery Girl Pedophilia Liberalism Trinity Homosexuality and Christianity Bisexuality Human Cult A Course In Miracles Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Islam as a political movement Legal aspects of transsexualism Homemaker Misandry Liberal Christianity Lesbian Multiculturalism Economics Animism Bernard Williams Who is a Jew?

reverse logic please answer why do people say if you don't like something you are in denial is it therefore impossible to dislike something and if you don't like something how should you express it without being being apart of it for example people who don't like gay's are accused of having denial issues with their sexuality how is that possible or even true if someone doesn't like pedophiles does that mean they secretly want to have sex with children if someone questions why women are a certain way for example some one asked why aren't women funny should the response be that this person is threatened by women how is does inquiry into an observation put one into the observation ad hominem attacks instead of answering the question the character of the person asking the question is attacked just something i notice about the responses on these boards always curious why they are answered as such stephanie lol i love it perfect kate yea i thought the question was dumb too but i felt it was from ignorance rather than insecurity first of all you have to make sure the statement is not based on a faulty premise i could make this statement man and woman makes child therefore might make for an interesting debate but why waste thought energy either the premise is valid or it isn't if it's valid then you have a base for discussion if the premise is not valid it's nonsense at least from your perspective read carefully you can't make sense out of non sense it's not reverse logic it's ill logic let it go  Philosophy of language Pedophilia Theodicy Sexual orientation Philosophical skepticism Epistemology Logic Meaning of life Atheism Deconstruction Ad hominem Transcendental argument for the existence of God A Course In Miracles Avenue Q G__del's incompleteness theorem Ontological argument Same-sex marriage Logical fallacy Internet troll Abortion debate Goodness and value theory Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Reality Criticism of Mormonism Plame affair Falsifiability Objectivist philosophy Logical argument Dissociative identity disorder Theory of conduct Intelligent design Presuppositional apologetics Social rule Causality Socrates Aesthetic Realism Free will Reparative therapy Ex-gay Contradiction Vacuous truth Intelligent design movement Paradox Augustus De Morgan Ethics 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Infant baptism Homosexuality and transgender Creation-evolution controversy Human sexual behavior Scientific method Feminism Existence of God David Hume Fallacy Biblical inerrancy Simone Weil Zoophilia Human Agnosticism Philosophy of mathematics Model (economics) Francis Hutcheson (philosopher) Law of value Sex education 2004 U.S. presidential election recounts and legal challenges Where Mathematics Comes From Philosophy Joke Slashdot subculture Postmodernism Childlove movement Criticism of libertarianism Determinism Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) John Titor Bill O'Reilly (commentator) Transsexuality Adjoint functors Rick Santorum Cultural relativism Arthur Schopenhauer Little Britain William A.

what is a stalker i asked the question here http answers yahoo com question index ylt ampq j ik lhr rplqftpsy ix qid aaqs kr if i myself am a stalker but i guess should first ask what is a stalker is it just someone who thinks about doing certain things or someone who does them the simple definition of stalker would seem to involve following people but it seems that in today's society it has extended to so much more in that light it would seem that i was a stalker in this situation but i am no more unless mere thoughts constitute being a stalker but wait i pass by her work area on the way to my work area and glance at her everyday though i could go another way damn so maybe i'm still a stalker but i ask you what is a stalker waswisgirl i hope you don't think all of those stalking traits apply to me and if you think i only stopped because of the write up there are two things i do not like threats and bribes accordingly i never stop something because of a mere threat i'm creative enough to harrass a woman without breaking the law or getting caught at least i'm stupid enough to think i am but i chose not to because i want her to be comfortable at work main reason i was sending the emails was to try to ease down the tension but it of course backfired and hindsight is you want a definition of 'stalker' ok here goes 'stalking is a crime which canadian criminal law calls criminal harassment it is clearly defined at section of canada's criminal code the code states that no person shall without lawful authority and knowing that another person is harassed or recklessly as to whether the other person is harassed repeatedly follow the other person or anyone known to them from place to place repeatedly communicate with either directly or indirectly the other person or anyone known to them beset or watch a place where the other person is visiting lives or works or engage in threatening conduct directed at the other person or any member of their family the punishment for stalking can be as high as a five year jail term this new section of the criminal code passed in makes it much easier for the police to charge a stalker the code did contain other sections that were helpful in blatant cases of stalking but they were ineffective against the more passive but just as frightening forms of stalking for example the code prohibits trespassing on another's property at night uttering threats indecent or harassing phone calls intimidation and mischief to another person's property under the criminal code you can also get a restraining order or a peace bond against a person measures which might in certain circumstances be preferable in some cases of aggressive or predatory stalking the new law now protects you even if the conduct of the stalker is not done with the intent to scare you it is enough if it does scare you actions that might be acceptable in a normal loving relationship could become criminal harassment when one of the persons wants the relationship to end and the other does not for example in these circumstances giving someone roses could in some cases be considered to be stalking as could repeated visits telephone calls or waiting for the victim after work everybody has a right to end a relationship a former spouse or partner should stop communicating with you if you have told them that their attention is not welcome if they persist section is there to help federal department of justice canada research conducted in found that of stalking cases examined of the accused were male and of the victims were female one of the key parts of section of the criminal code is the requirement that when the conduct being complained of is following or communicating it has to be repeated there is no set rule on this it can mean persistent or frequent behaviour but the following or communicating has to happen more then once for it to constitute criminal harassment but if the conduct is watching prowling or besetting a place where you are visiting live or work or if there has been threatening conduct one incident would suffice in getting a conviction under section in all cases the conduct must be such that apprehension or fear for their safety is reasonable this means having a fear for which there is a reason not a fear based on exaggeration of the situation or on imagined problems the law also excuses those that have lawful authority from being convicted under this section one example of this has been given as the private investigator that has been hired to check into an insurance claim that you have filed some cases which have gone to court under section include the accused made telephone calls and left threatening messages on the victim's answering machine the accused visited the victim's work place for no legitimate reason and followed the victim on buses or the accused made rude or obscene gestures towards the victim if you are being harassed we suggest you talk to the police a lawyer or a victim services agency any of the above should be able to counsel you on your best course of action you may be advised for example to stay away from your home for a short period of time you should certainly keep a diary of the harassing behaviour in case your memory should later fail in court if calls are coming in get a tracing device connected through your telephone company if you have a restraining order or peace bond carry it with you at all times if you are being stalked call the police if you know that the suspect carries or owns weapons this is important information for the police and yep your behavior elaborated on in the other post most definitely meets the definition  Torture Infantilism Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Katelyn Faber Same-sex marriage

why are men better at dancing like michael jackson than women i've never seen a woman do a good job dancing like mj compared to men some guys are incredible i've never seen a woman do a good moonwalk there are a lot of things male dancers can do and which female dancers cannot and almost all of them have to do with the differences in male and female bodies a woman's pelvis is shaped differently from a man's and is wider at the top while a man's is a lot closer to a square or rectangle shape that single difference accounts for the reason why women walk in a different manner than men their legs do not swing from the hip the same way when you talk about dancing there is also the issue of the size of a woman's thighs even very thin female dancers have extra fat on their thighs it's a biological fact add to that the fact that professional dancers develop more muscle and are differently muscled depending on their sex and you begin to see that a lot of the things men can do in dance are a physical impossibility for women for example a really good moonwalk requires the feet and legs to be fairly close together and pretty much parallel to each other that's possible for a man but nearly impossible for a woman both because of the shape of her pelvis and the shape of her thighs things like the tight spins that mj does where he crosses his feet and spins neatly are also not as clean looking when done by a woman because her legs will not be and cannot be as straight a lot of what he does looks the way it does because while he is not tremendously tall i think he's probably average which is ' for an american male he is very thin which leads to a very streamlined look even very thin female dancers still have to contend with breasts and rear ends and hips and thighs there are a lot of really great female dancers but they tend to excel at different types of dancing and it mainly has to do simply with how they are built  Equine conformation Aerial (dance move) Puberty Glossary of partner dance terms Undergarment Swingout Sexual differentiation Strap-on dildo Lindy Hop Professional wrestling holds Glossary of ballet terms Breech birth Figure skating Sexual attraction Androgen insensitivity syndrome Double bass West Coast Swing Diving Fast bowling Tango (dance) Contredanse Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Charleston (dance move) Mojave people Breast Professional wrestling attacks Hip hop culture Lead and follow (dance) Billie Jean Breaststroke Stewie Griffin Kylie Minogue Secondary sex characteristic Weight training Circle (dance move) Scottish country dance Textile manufacturing Horse Boxing Physical attractiveness Urinary incontinence Tyrannosaurus rex Bicycle Striptease Balboa (dance) English Country Dance Gender role Norway national football team Biped Stairway Pelvis Human anatomy Drag racing Swimming Volleyball Jennifer Lopez Orgasm Side pass (dance move) Japanese tea ceremony Anal sex American football Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Michael Jackson Social rule Gender-neutral language Paula Abdul Diamond cut Combine (Half-Life 2) Brassiere Hair Dinosaur Sport rowing Duchenne muscular dystrophy Body image Anatomical terms of location Beat It 2000 Australian Grand Prix 1957 World Series Tennis Nudity Skirt and dress Stocking Rod Stewart Gay slang Muay Thai Human sexual behavior View camera Sexual dimorphism Spider Mr. Olympia Intersex surgery

where do women get off saying men cannot handle pregnency that is ridicolous and doesn't make any sense what information supports this claim i guess you women think a man would die from giving birth because of he can survive it he can handle it i know this claim always annoys me as well men may not be able to give birth but plenty of men have endured other probably even more traumatic experiences who do you think the vast majority of soldiers and warriors throughout human history have been men but of course getting an arm hacked off your face whacked with a spiked mace bullets to the gut your flesh ripped up by shrapnel or your skin burned with mustard gas is nothing compared to the pain and trauma of pregnancy and birth right whenever i hear this argument that giving birth requires some kind of special courage that only woman can have i feel like slapping the people who say it for their stupidity go talk to the men who fought in the trenches of wwi or survived the bataan death march and tell them how they couldn't possibly take the strain of pregnancy  Trench warfare Abortion debate Use of poison gas in World War I Post-traumatic stress disorder Abortion Pregnancy Childbirth Miscarriage Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Birth control Breastfeeding Clothing Theory of conduct Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Poker jargon Breech birth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Irish Guards Human sexual behavior World War I Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Homer Simpson Romulus and Remus Darth Vader Unreal Human Rape Goodness and value theory Major League Baseball television contracts Left-handed Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Psoriasis Tank classification Spina bifida Philosophical skepticism Chemical warfare Obstetrics Nazi human experimentation Ammunition Aztec Hearing impairment Smallpox Anne Boleyn Theodicy Transsexuality Fathers' rights Bataan Marriage Doomsday argument Terminal ballistics The Dunciad Dissociative identity disorder God Emperor of Dune Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Wolfrider Fecal incontinence Cytomegalovirus Immortality Reincarnation Comanche K' Hera Storytelling Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Doctor (Doctor Who) Condom Little Britain Social rule Tank Aortic dissection W.I.T.C.H.

women required to shave parts of the body to be hired men have to shave their faces in order to join corporate or military america yet women are not required to shave parts of their bodies is this fair it depends on the type of work here is my take on the military everything should be equal women should have to shave their head when they enter boot camp women should also have the same requirements as the men in regard to physical fitness requirements my brother who was in the military wanted to be a paratrooper and to do that you have to run with a full pack a certain distance in a given amount of time he did not meet his requirement but a woman who ran the distance in less time than my brother met her requirement that is wrong this is not high school gym class this is the military these people are supposed to protect us standards for women should not be lowered because it's not fair joining the military is not about being fair if a woman can pass the same requirements as the men then by all means let them do whatever if women want equality then things really need to be equal including shaving their head in the military it's not a beauty contest and in food sevice i've been in food service for years and not once has a manager said anything to any of the women to cut their hair put it up or something if you find a hair in your food chances are it doesn't belong to a man but yet the men are told to shave i've also seen women with long nails with polish on them and they aren't told to cut their nails or to not have polish if you prepare food in a restaurant and you do these things it is in violation of the health department but yet nothing is said to any of the woman corporate america hair cutting no but the style yes you are a work representing your employer example like no spikes purple hair hair that looks mangled and dirty other jobs can't think of anything where it would be necessary  Hair Beard Depilation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Haircut Baldness Social rule Golf Professional wrestling match types Global Gillette Recruit training Shaving RuneScape quests Hormone replacement therapy (trans) The Amber Spyglass Shoe Virginia Military Institute Glossary of American football Simone Weil Drug test Explosive material Humphrey Bogart Norwegian Campaign Softball Oral sex Guinea pig Food and Drug Administration Friends Vlad III Dracula Affirmative action Sexual attraction Theory of conduct Kurt Angle Shaggy dog story Abortion debate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hijab Poker jargon American football Bodybuilding Physical attractiveness 613 mitzvot Sin City Beavis and Butt-head Salute Capitalism Great Teacher Onizuka Volleyball Mixed martial arts Divorce The Apprentice 2 Customs and etiquette of Japan FairTax Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Microsoft Edith Nourse Rogers Baseball Boy Scouts of America Kimono Evan Mecham Human rights in the United States Strap-on dildo Floppy disk Pok__mon Abilities Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) The Pilgrim's Progress Comanche Grade (education) Scouting Dalton McGuinty Windows XP United States Postal Service Windows 2000 Breath of Fire III Black hole Bubble Bobble Doomsday argument Nail (anatomy) Happy Tree Friends Artemis Entreri Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Life insurance Rigging Gay rights Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Triathlon Jewish bereavement Piccolo Junior Saga EastEnders Paul Is Dead Archery Skinhead

am i a stalker i like this girl at this gym i work at she teaches group exercise classes oneday i sent her flowers anonymously with my email attached over the next few weeks i traded emails with her telling her i liked her until i finally got up the nerve to tell her who i was she sent an email thanking me for the flowers but saying she was in a relationship i then sent her seven emails over the course of four months with no response i could see this made her nervous so i attempted to tell her in person i would stop i had to take two of her classes classes i normally take before i could get a moment alone with her she was terrified but after class i apologized saying i'd stop sending emails and she said that it was ok the next week i got written up and the write up read bob is getting written up because he has been sending mary emails and she has told him to stop though she hadn't and he attended two of her classes and sent her a voicemails sic i own up to unsavory behavior but the wording of this was unsettling to me am i just some bitter stalker in addition to sending her a voice mail saying i'd stop the emails which i didn't think would go through i attempted to call her on her business cell but backed out feeling that it crossed the line i have fantasies of just running up to her and kissing her dead on the lips and i purposely walked by her house once when i had a package that i needed to pick up from the post office in her neighborhood am i a stalker do i need help randomx i don't know why i had to tell her i'd stop i just wanted to apologize in person and make sure things were ok between us and i didn't want her to have to worry everyday about whether or not i'd send an email i wanted her to know for sure waswisgirl you say you're discounting how upset your victim is and justifying your behavior by telling yourself and us that you wanted to contact her 'just to say you're sorry' waswis first of all i haven't contacted her in year or so secondly could you please provide my actual reason for wanting to contact her in person i could have done it by email but her friend had already indicated no more emails if i did it by cell that would have crossed a line and i got written up for sending a voice mail so my only option seemed like in person the only thing hr commended me on during the write up was the apology and let it be noted that when i finally did contact her all i did was say i'm sorry and that i'd stop sending the emails so if i had other motives please tell me and i need more info to know what you mean by discounting how upset my victim was oh and waswisgirl you seem to be discounting how upset i was you weren't the one who looked her in the eye and saw how terrified she was i was there and that hurt me that i put her through that and that's why i resolved once and for all to leave her alone it was for her feelings and her feelings alone i didn't have to sign that write up i've refused to sign them before but it did it just to show that yes i care about her comfort so please before you talk about me discounting other people's feelings don't discount mine i give a damn about how she feels it was just open to interpretation while i was sending the emails but clearcut once i looked into her eyes and saw the terror i hated it why ask the question if you just wanted to hear what a nice little boy you are and how misunderstood and wholesome you are you're the one who got written up none of your excuses cut it you're a stalker ah waswisgirl the broken record you're a stalker anways i agree that with the lose definition given a stalker i would be one but the reason why i asked this question was merely to get other people's perspectives and to just talk about it i haven't talked to anyone about this at all for two reasons a i didn't want to tell my story only for people to prop me up and demonize this girl who didn't know what to do in an unfamiliar situation b i didn't want hear someone just bash me telling me what i did wrong things i already know but unfortunately those are more or less the two types of answers i will get your answer just seems so vitrolic and assumes too much about me to be taken seriously you seem to have issues youself turn in down a notch you are crossing the line why did you have to tell her that you'd stop the emails you should have just stopped you also shouldn't have sent so many as two at most would have told you that she wasn't interested in replying the whole secret admirer thing is creepy too you definitely need to get over her and learn about boundaries lack of boundaries is kinda a big stalker warning thing too she's completely right to be creeped out and i would be too because that behavior that lack of boundaries is telling you might not be violent or a rapist but women have to be careful about that sort of thing and if you lack personal boundaries you may very well lack physical ones she can't tell where your personal line is and from her perspective it's already too far into creepy territory i'm a big believer in people talking to therapists in general and i'm kinda hard put to tell you what else to do at least talking to a professional might help you with your lack of confidence and to figure out where boundaries are supposed to be  Milton H.

homophobia do you agree with these statements it is generally argued that homophobia is a mechanism for regulating the behaviour of all men rather than just self identified homosexuals and it has been proposed that homophobia is an essential characteristic of patriarchal society dils ann cooper albright ann ed moving history dancing cultures dance history reader pg it attracts my attention that the most homophobic people seem afraid of their own possible homosexuality as if by attacking homosexuals would confirm their personal sexual orientation the funny thing is that these same homophobic people tend to denigrate women as well isn't this contradictory bushman i ask this question because it pertains gender and women's studies why i have to explain this bushman again i don't understand why a simple question disturbs you so much i am not insulting anyone just thinking about homophobia because i was reading a section of this book about it breath in and breath out calm down gosh i don't know even why i have to defend my right to ask a question where i am curious about the position of other contributors dazvidania jeff of my friends are homosexual there are homophobic people i know it i have seen it in real life and here in yahoo answers wow some reactions are really wow jeff sorry i was reading too fast i apologize sorry again wow what an ugly following this answer attracted nothing like having the bible beaters come out of the woodwork and share their love for those different from themselves as well as the people who just love to hate lesbians and gay men because they can it's so pc to hate lesbians and gay men too because obviously god is on their side too not every time a man or woman wants to do something that a man is not suppose to do or does what a woman is not suppose to do they are labeled a homosexual since gay hatred is so socially acceptable based on religious intolerance and gay hating legislation labeling someone gay is the time tested tool to use to keep both men and women in their place meaning in their sexist traditional gender stereotypical roles look how often feminists are labeled gay and lesbian by anti feminists on this web site like every day multiple times a day and look how many men and women rush to say i'm not gay but or i'm not a feminist but anytime a man tries to talk about feminism in a positive light the first thing an anti feminist says is you must be gay the first thing young feminists male and female say to an anti feminist is the same thing you must be gay one of the worst insults you can make in this society is to accuse someone of being gay so it is an essential tool of social control especially by those that have the authority of their church and law behind them to enforce it and there really is a good reason to fear being labeled gay or lesbian in this society there is no right to employment in the majority of us states if you are perceived to be gay or if you are actually gay or lesbian so if someone labels you as gay even if you aren't you can legally be fired with the reason they're gay in the majority of us states you can also be kicked out of the military and don't have a right to your home furnishings or personal items if you don't have a will and your partner dies even if you do have a will you can still lose everything you shared with your partner you will most likely lose custody of your children if someone accuses you of being gay as well there are truly severe repercussions for being labeled gay in us society i don't know if homophobia was an essential characteristic of patriarchal societies in the past but it sure has been an effective strategy for enforcing social control for the last few hundred years in us society just a whisper of homosexuality or lesbianism has been the end of many people's careers marriages and their leadership roles in their community it still works too i agree that you are a gay hater if you're against gay marriage too i personally hate marriage but i recognize all the privileges that married people get over unmarried people by denying those rights to committed couples because of their sexual orientation is discriminatory gay couples aren't asking to be married in every church in the nation so the religious crud doesn't hold water but marriage does provide thousands of privileges and rights for those that are eligible to marry that other committed couples can not have and many of these rights have to do with taxes wills custody and property so gays and lesbians are being denied many rights every citizen has if they are heterosexual that's discrimination and when states make explicit laws stating that people of the same sex can not marry that's discrimination laws prohibiting whites and non whites from marrying were in place until just a few years ago it took the supreme court to override those state laws since the states refused to get rid of them since racism was so socially acceptable why does this matter to me i'm bisexual i was with a woman for years and people did not know unless i told them since i look stereotypically feminine i refuse to pass for straight just because it would be easier i almost lost my job when i put my female partner as my partner on my work life insurance the hr director was stunned that i stated it she had never had anyone admit to her that they were gay she proceeded to tell a great deal of the staff and quite a few were very upset and made sure i knew it when did this happen years ago hatred and fear of gays and lesbians is a social disease but one that is totally socially acceptable in the us enforced by law and religion  Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith Section 28 Plame affair Legal aspects of transsexualism Divorce Laura Schlessinger Coming out LGBT

has masculinity in men been demonised so much by society women that men no longer have a gender identity i asked this as a purely theoretical question out of an interest in sociology and gender studies not because i have a 'crisis of my identity' was it too much to ask to expect a proper theoretical academic discussion on this topic from most of you and sammie thank you so much for being the first one with an intelligent point to make even though i don't agree totally you make a good point isildurs babe i am not posing the question can a man only be a man if he can dominate a female so get off your nazi feminist high horse and see if you can start writing some intelligent answers for a change and aggression is a part of masculinity it is a natural biological and psychological response of the human male as are traits such as the need to be strong emotionless tough virile athletic etc direct competition of physical skill and or strength is a feature of masculinity which appears in some form in virtually every culture on earth these are some examples which you yourself have admitted have been demonized by society yet they are a natural form of the male psyche and we cannot help but have these traits so how do we act behave express ourselves when we are told our natural responses are wrong how do you personally define masculinity there are a lot of excellent books on this subject which i won't go into and quote but just do a little looking under gender studies or just look up books on masculinity men and women are studying what the word means in context who defines it how it is understood culturally how it evolves there's a great book called female masculinity very cool book lots to think about i feel that masculinity has been analyzed and broken down and that there is effort being made to re define masculinity masculine traits are what we as a culture society come up with and then create this rigid system where male bodied people men are expected to exhibit certain qualities and behaviors that are called masculine sometimes men get the idea especially in certain cultures that masculine men beat their wives and girlfriends and subjugate them they believe that masculinity means superiority over women and over things that are deemed feminine female bodied people women are expected to adhere to rigid standards of what our society currently deems to be acceptable or required feminine characteristics otherwise she is mocked and presumed to be gay and vice versa when men don't act masculine enough the equating gender identity gender expressionand sexual orientation labelling things strictly feminine and masculine is damaging men and it is damaging women as well as the androgenous and the genderbending genderqueer transgender population people are finally realizing that to be a masculine man one doesn't need to use physical force to dominate others and overpower them masculinity doesn't require one to dress one certain way play sports work manly jobs have manly hobbies activities etc its being re examined and evaluated letting men know they have the freedom to be whoever it is they're hardwired to be that they can like flowers or interior design wear pink and watch food network and not be any less of a man i've known plenty of guys who say they don't fit in because they aren't into sports they only have sex with partners they love and care about they have jobs that have been associated over time as 'womens work' and that they hate it and don't feel accepted by other guys some men go too far to try and prove they're tough guys super masculine and they go around knocking people down literally and figuritively to prove they are real men who call the shots don't take crap say what they want and can kick anyones a if they wanted to men are making strides toward being able to forge their own path and define for themselves their gender identity without trying to live up to someone else's definition  Homosexuality Human Sociology Human sexual behavior Grammatical gender Cross-dressing Homophobia God and gender Physical attractiveness Gender identity disorder God Social rule Social psychology Ethics Homosexuality and Christianity Theory of conduct Gay slang Domestic violence Rape Political correctness Religion History of intersex surgery Asperger syndrome Masculism Intersexuality Woman Masculinity Power (sociology) Science Carl Jung Goodness and value theory Queer Reparative therapy Intelligent design Gay rights Franz Boas Man Zoophilia Same-sex marriage Butch and femme Meaning of life A Course In Miracles Culture Drag queen Lesbian Postmodernism God the Father John Money Infantilism Quebec French Species Girl Deconstruction Hierarchy Martial art Atheism Alignment (role-playing games) Susan McClary Scientific method Goddess Spanish nouns Joke Human nature Friends Bulgarian language Gay Nicomachean Ethics Democracy Liberalism Little Britain Jacob Neusner

which one one is worse manipulation or physical violence manipulation is subtle and not explicit whereas violence is explicit and can be combated i think messing with someone's head is worse than physical assault although the latter also causes the former emotional abuse can be devastating which is why some forms of torture have very little to do with attacking people physically i've said this before but watch the movie in the company of men it's a good indication of how messing with someone's mind can be worse than a punch in the face neither is good and it's hard to quantify worse vs better but emotional abuse is a very real problem and causes long term and severe problems  Domestic violence Torture Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse EastEnders Rape Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Lightsaber combat Motion picture rating system Sin City Mind control Sexual abuse Zoophilia Pornography Cult Domination & submission (BDSM) Social rule Humphrey Bogart Narcissism American Psycho Force powers Martial art Al-Aqsa Intifada Corporal punishment Probability Self-harm Fathers' rights Hate group Drug abuse Traumatic brain injury ABC Warriors Violence in sports Aikido Boston Public Spanking Camp Delta Alcoholism Mental illness Human Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Child abuse 2003 Invasion of Iraq Gun politics Scientology beliefs and practices Tenshinhan Iraq War Dead Like Me Butters Stotch Child sexual abuse Addiction Anarcho-primitivism Anti-Semitism Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Transsexuality Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chapterhouse Dune Street fighting Intellectual property Divorce Bully Cybersex Subtle body Antisocial personality disorder Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Stuttering Insomnia Mojave people Auto Assault Philosophy of mathematics The nature of God in Western theology Concussion of the brain Piccolo Junior Saga Cheating in poker T'Pol Death Comes to Time Involuntary commitment Logic Spousal abuse Prostate cancer Combat stress reaction Tai Chi Chuan Chronic fatigue syndrome Hulk (comics) Amnesty International Freddy Krueger Uses of torture in recent times Borderline personality disorder Stoicism Childlove movement Asperger syndrome Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal YuYu Hakusho ALGOL 68 Opposition to cults and new religious movements Schizophrenia Aestheticization of violence Anger management Violence Trafficking in human beings Combine (Half-Life 2) Pointer

gender equality where to go from here there's been alot said in this section with both men and women talking about how each gender is still looking for equality and better rights if there has been a lack of so how do each of us begin with working towards solving some of the issues what would be your first action towards making a difference and which issue would you work on first i'm disappointed in a few of the answers particularly the first one and kendrick's and cassius the first one because while humour is ok to say something like that is not helping anything at all just creating a greater divide between genders kendrick and cassius please don't tar all women with the same brush not all women believe in superiority it's the biggest crock of crap i ever heard and alot of us do listen to a mans point of view when it comes to helping men have better rights such as in divorces etc if in any doubt please read my previous q on violence against men nowhere but down nah just kidding i'd like to see parenting change to be honest i've heard a lot of unusual based on my experiences things about some families that just don't make sense to me i would like to see better care of children by both the mother and father yes i am assuming a heterosexual pairing because it is typical and fundamental i have enough experience with what a working parent can do for his her children that the idea of a father not contributing to work and raising children doesn't hold water i won't begin to comment on a woman who abandons neglects her child because the idea sickens me so in short people should raise their children better if we did that and instilled concepts of equality in the home we wouldn't need to worry about more than half of the issues we have today but that's a preventive measure that would actually take time to take effect so we might as well throw it by the wayside people aren't typically interested in time consuming commitments they're interested in quick fixes and the now  Divorce Transsexuality Masculism Fathers' rights Domestic violence Feminism Sexual orientation Theory of conduct Abortion debate Economic inequality Same-sex marriage Extreme Programming Social rule Same-sex marriage in Canada Gender role Laura Schlessinger Adoption Infantilism Theodicy Homosexuality and Christianity Feminist movement Hillary Rodham Clinton Mary Wollstonecraft Philosophical skepticism Supply and demand The nature of God in Western theology Philosophy of space and time James Dobson Transactional analysis Human sexual behavior Religious Society of Friends Philosophy of language Equal Protection Clause Civil rights Polygamy Software engineering Reparative therapy Homophobia Second language acquisition Child custody Cross-dressing Grammatical gender Fathers' rights movement in the UK Liberalism Same-sex marriage in the United States Property (ownership right) Goodness and value theory Gay rights About a Boy Animal rights God and gender Democracy Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Little Britain Predestination Lawrence v.

gentlemen what are the reasons and mindsets behind men not reporting abuse by women against them today young girls are taught to defend themselves and take the physical aggression to the next level i dont need to mention the self defense classes are boys still taught not to defend themselves if there is unprovoked physical harm caused by a girl because men dont hot women what do parents and schools teach these young boys is this one of the reasons why the abuse of men by women and the very less number of reported cases is this a grey area left unexplored and ignored deliberatley when these boys grow up do they develop a mindset which leads to this edit the fact is if boys are not fed idiotic ideas of chivalry and start defending themselves aginst girls the stuation becomes a challenge for the legal system males are taught from a very early age not to hit a woman as a whole we are physically bigger and stronger we are taught to tolerate a slap punch verbal abuse and physical abuse for a male to report a woman as being physically abusive goes against everything they are taught from birth stripping them of their manhood and subjecting them to ridicule from their peers men have been the guilty party for hundreds of years simply because of our strenght and sex yet there has always been a or at least split in who instigated the problem women females are coming into their own they have decided to become physical and unfortunately the prison system directly reflects this new found power it has taken years to curb a males instinct to lash out at any threat i can remember years ago being severely punished for inadvertently stepping on a girl's fingers during recess while playing a game of tag yet we are now in an age when girls brandish weapons guns commit assaults murders and every other crime know to man sadly for society and our children this will continue to escalate destroying families and all we once held sacred i am neither an anti woman's lib nor am i in favor of abuse of any kind but i do long for the times when our roles were more defined and children family were the most important thing in ones life a woman is one of the most precious things in any man's life she brings softness nurturing calm harmony and love into a relationship unfortunately women are more and more bring violence into it  Domestic violence Rape Infantilism Transsexuality Divorce Simone Weil Corporal punishment EastEnders Abortion debate Murder Sex Pedophilia Human sexual behavior Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Spanking Martial art Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Aikido Zoophilia Anti-aircraft warfare Drug abuse Fathers' rights Age of consent Coercion Androgen insensitivity syndrome 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Capital punishment Childlove movement Al-Aqsa Intifada Human Sexual orientation Hikikomori Gender role Religion and sexuality The Inside French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Trafficking in human beings Scientology beliefs and practices Theory of conduct Left-handed Serial killer Bully Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Romulus and Remus Mumia Abu-Jamal One Tree Hill (TV series) Sex and the City Confucianism Stoicism Punishment Alcoholics Anonymous Plame affair History of intersex surgery Homosexuality and Christianity Defense (justification) Education Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Addiction Urinary incontinence Dog Masculism Slander and libel Gun safety Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an W.I.T.C.H.

feminists may you give me a source that states women make less than men due to discriminatory pratices i heard it so many times women make less than men for every dollar feminists cannot seem to agree on the real amount women make for every dollar a man makes i have heard them say women make or for evert dollar a man makes which is it aren't feminists especially the radical ones and misandrists supposed to know this things it is their issue yet they cannot agree on a how do they expect me to believe in their fairytale wage gap with stuff like this i want a study which compares men and women within a same company with the same job and job title who have been working for the company just as long working the same amount of hours each week with the same flexibility ability to work extra hours with the same credentials and experiences who took just as many sick days off where the women did not take any maternity leave i will then evaluate the credibility of the source blogs are worthless if you comply and meet requirements i shall believe this wage gap and raise awareness of it i shall fight for your cause failure to comply will result in showing of feminists are full of crap get to work posters you are proving my point you ask me not to question this as to not create more percentages you can disagree on well too bad you ask me to make my own studies i have it says there is no wage gap poster made up stuff the ''geek'' fails to understand ''supply and demand'' http en wikipedia org wiki supply and demand she fails to acknowledge feminism argument of women being discriminated against which results in lesser pay she thinks employers should give single moms more time off etc well get real in the real world employers want people that work when needed no employer will hire a mom that needs a day off every week over a wo man that takes a day off every month she needs to get real this is business if you have no sources to give me then don't fucking spam in my fucking question thx i do not wish to debate here if you're open minded enough for a debate and have enabled email i will email you for now i am done commenting on answers it works to their advantage because most people are too lazy to do their own homework or even worse do their own thinking the reason the percentages never settle on any amount is because it is all smoke and mirrors not reality when like is compared to like men and women are paid the same the eeoc demands women be paid equally to that of equally situated men backed by state and federal law any woman who feels they are being discriminated against only has to file a claim and eeoc will do all the work investigate any claims and fine and or punish violators the problem is feminists compare like with different to prove how unequal wages are which is much like saying teenagers with summer jobs are discriminated against because they don't earn the same amount as a tenured full time employee working a different job in a different company by the way your statistic is wrong the correct number is closer to first the sheer amount of work according to the bureau of labor statistics full time men clock an average of hours a week while women put in hours men are more than twice as likely as women to work at least hours a week that s why most ceos are male only in a socialist economy do employees get paid the same regardless of the number of hours worked second men tend to gravitate to the socially unrewarding but lucrative fields like computer programming tax law and engineering and women select professions such as teaching nursing and social work that pay less but offer more job flexibility third is job desirability recently the jobs rated almanac rated jobs based on income work environment physical demands stress and so forth these were the five worst jobs seaman ironworker cowboy fisherman and lumberjack does it come as a surprise that all of these jobs are male dominated the only way these companies can attract men to do the dirty work is to increase their paychecks finally is the difference in job hazards men represent of all occupational deaths why because if you look at a list of the most hazardous occupations fire fighting truck driving construction and mining they have male employees according to the bureau of labor statistics shouldn t men who risk their lives on a daily basis be paid something extra corey roberts  Capitalism Insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Keynesian economics Economics Feminism Principal-agent problem Labour economics

what age was eve when she first ate the apple give me a age range the story is an allegory for the human condition that's not the same as a fairy tale a major theme in it concerns human egoic experience which confers self consciousness the possibility of constructing alternative behavioral choices free will and the ability to judge some behaviors as right and others wrong hence the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil partaking of this kind of knowledge marked the end of ignorance and ignorance being bliss the loss of ignorance and innocence entailed the expulsion from paradise this story being from genesis adam and eve would be young past the age of the primitive beginnings of self consciousness probably around the age where such self consciousness would become reflective and morally functional in earlier times this might have been around or but today it seems to arrive at about age or if at all baby boomers are particularly adept at extending their moral adolescence this part of the story may have been inherited from earlier more feminine religions it treats the loss of innocence like a real loss while the patriarchal intellectual trend of antiquity moved clearly toward abstract intellectualism and the making of clear distinctions  Original sin Paradise Lost Adam and Eve Human nature Theodicy Human Tree of Life Abortion debate Psychology Tree of Knowledge Grimke Sisters Philo The Fall of Man Determinism Satan Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Garden of Eden Theory of conduct Microeconomics Summa Theologiae Altruism Consciousness Victor Cousin Sexual orientation Rudolf Steiner Free will Feminism Atheism Intellectual property Sociocultural evolution Modernism Yoga Law of value Satanism David Hume Narcissism Ishmael (novel) Infantilism Goodness and value theory God Sigmund Freud Friedrich Schleiermacher Angel Historical materialism Socrates Cultural relativism Economics Soul Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Science Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ethics Religion and sexuality Storytelling Mathematics Religion Supernatural Entheogen Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Young Earth creationism Alignment (role-playing games) Reincarnation Objective-C Homosexuality The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Postmodernity Objectivist philosophy Meme Religion and sexual orientation Brahmanism Coercion Medicine Second language acquisition Franz Boas Origin belief S__ren Kierkegaard Western philosophy Immortality Education Apple Decision theory Academia Psychology of religion School of Salamanca Mitochondrial Eve Social justice Mythology Postmodernism Genesis Animal rights Merit

im uncertain of my sexual orientation okay so i have a boyfriend and everything right but then sometimes i just imagine myself better off being with a girl i enjoy fantasizin bout girls and i also had a dream this one time of making love with a female and going out and dating them am i straight or bi or is it just a lil phaze i need help i have had similar issues with this experience usually the reason a heterosexual female will have phases of attraction to females is because of a bad experience they had with a male father figure growing up or a bad experience with a previous boyfriend in my experience i sometimes yearn for the comfort and closeness of another female because i feel safer around them this may not be the case in your situation my suggestion is that you may be bi curious for a number of reasons you may need to just experiement or discuss it with your boyfriend if you can sometimes they are supportive if you have a friend that is interested you can try cuddling or kissing to determine both of your boundries and how comfortable you feel doing it after the experience refect on it and if it was overall positive the rest is up to you don't be afriad or supress your feelings it's better to try and figure out your orientation now before you get involved in a serious relationship imagine how difficult it would be if you were married or even had kids when you realized your preference overall i think it's best to consider it a phase it depends on your past and how long you have had these feelings best wishes  Sexual orientation Human sexual behavior Child sexuality Strap-on dildo Homosexuality and Christianity Pedophilia Infantilism Bisexuality Gender role One Tree Hill (TV series) Homophobia Coming out Heterosexuality Transsexuality Biology and sexual orientation Anal sex Friendship Orgasm Transgender Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Zoophilia Scenes from a Memory Age of consent Mixed martial arts Ex-gay Laura Schlessinger Something Positive Milton H.

do women really have it worse than men with as little troll in this question as possible i will procede can anyone tell my why women today can get of murder just by saying not even proving he hit me don't they almost always get custody of kids in courts they can get the same job as a man if a women says someone raped her he is pretty much looked at as a scumbag right then without any proof remember that girl who said some guys raped her from duke didnt that turn out to be false i have never heard of a woman paying alimony or child support so why do chicks have it so bad please do not take this as me hating women or something women are not enslaved and they have equal rights it is in no way the same do they have female sections in resturants do you have diffrent water fountains have you ever been spit on and humiliated and for that matter has anyone ever sprayed you with a firehose the only areas where women's lives are more difficult are possibly in a few third world countries but the men's lives are probably not any better by comparison so maybe not and by biology in the us some states demand that a man support his wife financially but do not demand she reciprocate women file for divorce in about of cases custody is nearly always given to the mother by default and with it child support that is based not on children's cost but the parents incomes with add ons such as life insurance on the payer health insurance on the children child care even for teenage and sometimes even grown children etc and the real killer is that this money does not need to be spent on the children at all it is income to the custodial parent period there are a few women who pay child support but they are more likely to skip out of paying than men the number of women paying alimony is as rare but there are a couple of them usually celebrities then there is the false accusations of abuse rape pedophilia paternity fraud etc where a woman's word is taken as fact without corroborating evidence many men have been released from prison over the past few years after serving up to and over years based on things like mistaken identity many more men who are not guilty are still in prison simply because they cannot prove their innocence a requirement that is counter to procedure of american jurisprudence affirmative action is state mandated discrimination used to elevate the numbers of certain individuals to levels and numbers they cannot accomplish on their own merits this was hijacked by the feminist movement to include women as a minority of the population once employed women can claim sexual harassment against any man and her word is viewed as true the man charged must prove himself innocent and if unable will be terminated and possibly sued or even charged with a crime it is possible but very difficult for a man to charge a woman with harassment at least not to the same extent women's health care and research spending is far higher compared to that of men's in spite of the fact that on average women live longer than men men pay higher premiums for auto insurance because statistically men are more likely to be involved in an accident but women don't pay higher health insurance premiums even though they are many times more likely to utilize medical treatment there is a violence against women's act which is a means of funneling millions of dollars from taxpayers into feminists hands for use in areas like promoting the false accusations of abuse and rape and a place to hide out at tax payer expense there is very few such places for men most states have nothing to assist abused men at all every state and some cities has a women's business section in their state government where women can get low cost loans at tax payer expense to start a business that will most likely fail within the first three years there women can get advice assistance equipment etc but men need not apply in the area of crime when convicted of the same crime a woman will receive less time or more than a man women who murder their husbands or children can often claim pms postpartum depression clinical depression and other emotional and hormonal imbalances which is unavailable in men's defense women control of spending in the free world yet earn only a small portion of it women are paid equally to men in the same category with the same education tenure and dedication but fewer women are qualified for upper ranks of management when compared to men obviously the numbers will be unbalanced and for good reason fewer women are as dedicated as the greater number of men and most women choose part time or lower paying jobs the averages are skewed but the wages are equal there are state and federal laws against pay discrimination and more the area where men are favored is arguably that of physiology which may be the whole reason for so much anti male sentiment in feminism trying to make up by law that which cannot be

feminists about predominantly female occupations i'd like to hear what feminists think of as the eventual future state of things in occupational fields that women dominate such as elementary education or nursing etc will an effort eventually have to be made to get an equal number of males in there with a kind of affirmative action or will we continue to pick proportionally from applicants as they come and just see if things even themselves out the way men seem to continually dominate certain things like the military i know it's not a high priority today but i'm curious that's a really excellent question and i really don't know the thing about most women's professions is that they come with little power and influence and as another respondent noted little pay and many times little thanks there's less of a problem with having fewer men in a field like secretarial work where little decision making is done than there is with having fewer women in positions of power e g in congress and the courts did you know congress still is comprised of only about percent women i think the men who want to go into traditionally female work and vice versa are just fantastic but a lot's going to have to change to get women into welding and men into child care again which is better paid by far welding  Gender role Feminism Gender-neutral language Education in the People's Republic of China Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Affirmative action Economic inequality Welding Fathers' rights Civil rights Ethics Education in Japan Israeli Arab Congress of the United States Article One of the United States Constitution U.S. Electoral College Equal Protection Clause United States House of Representatives Education in the United States Transsexuality Woman United States Senate NAACP Homemaker Medicine Capitalism Rosa Parks Military of the United States Feminist movement Federal Marriage Amendment Same-sex marriage Extreme Programming Patriarchy George W.

are you able to stand in another person's shoes i ask this of all debators here it is a broad question not aimed at anyone or anything in particular people do not typically wake up one morning and decide to wreck someone's day there is a reason for all behavior i try very hard to understand another persons point of view whether what's said is from a man or woman though sometimes i fail but i do try the main thing though that would make it easier for people to see your own point of view is to learn how to put across what you want to say in an unblaming non ranting manner i can understand that men do get the short end of the stick when it comes to discrimination but seeing the bad reputation that feminism has in society right now because of a few extremists of past wouldn't something valuable have been learnt from that it's fine for men to speak their minds but when all women are put down regardless it does turn everyone away ultimately you may gain what you want in the short term but gender relations will still be sour in order to want people to be understanding of your gender's issues it is worthwhile and more is ultimately achieved first being respect if you try to understand the other side of the story put the shoe on the other foot  Sexual orientation Gender role Theory of conduct Cross-dressing Philosophy of language Transsexuality God and gender Feminism Transgender Homophobia Goodness and value theory Gender-neutral language Gender Social psychology Gender identity Economic inequality Sex Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus High-heeled shoe Same-sex marriage Ethics Psychology Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Human sexual behavior Volleyball Nicomachean Ethics Debate Heteronormativity About a Boy Cultural relativism Feminist movement Sento Mind Softball Free will Sex-positive feminism Multiculturalism Abortion debate Poverty Domestic violence Human sexuality Predestination Left-wing politics Social rule Civil rights Affirmative action Philosophy Women in Islam Ruth Bader Ginsburg Past teachings of Prem Rawat Political correctness Shoe Fathers' rights Religious Society of Friends Human Postmodernism Person Second language acquisition Chess strategy and tactics Woman Scientology beliefs and practices Socrates Summa Theologiae Fast bowling The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex The nature of God in Western theology Radical feminism Homosexuality and transgender Milton H.

if i took a women's studies course at college would i be singled out and discriminated against by women i've heard horror stories from guys that took gender women's studies courses at college they said first and foremost they stood out like a sore thumb since they were a guy they said there's usually or guys in a class of about so the men will get singled out and receive mean stares from already embittered women students and professor that hates men they said the women professors hate men and a man will have to work about twice as hard a woman to earn the same grade they said the men are routinely ridiculed and embarrassed by the female students and the professor i've contemplated taking women's studies so i can better understand and be concordant with the female specimen however the horror stories told to me may turn me off from following through with such an idea perhaps its best to drop the idea altogether any men or women that have taken a women's studies course care to shed light on why these women are like this towards the men waswis interesting can you elaborate as to why these men got attention and what makes the women foolish for trying to enlighten the guys i took a couple of graduate seminars in women's studies when i was an undergrad and found it interesting i did find some hostility but if you're an intelligent guy with a thick skin then go for it every guy should know about what goes on in women's studies classes feminist theory is often bizarre and often represents almost unimaginable strainings to hammer square facts into round holes through extreme selectivity of vision by validating feelings more than inconvenient data and by some epistemological theories that defy belief many feminist authors try to swamp the reader with citations and huge bibliographies take the time to check out the sources they sometimes include valid data but if you compare the conclusions drawn from them they often rely on very strained and selective interpretations of those data there are a lot of references to third and fourth rate sociological studies whose conclusions don't follow from their data and references to the work of other feminist authors who also treat citation validity as a matter of quantity instead of quality and you should really read some of the leading lights of feminism from betty friedan to mary daly and susan griffin to barbara ehrenreich to see how in the worst cases the stuff is just insane and in the less bad cases it's merely very biased from a particular female point of view and makes no worthy claim for ganeral validation except as evidence of how some women think every guy should come to understand the critique of phallocentrism and the dead white men of antiquity and then use its methodology to guage the uterocentrism of today's conventional wisdom every guy should take women's studies and come to know why serious philosophers don't take feminist theory seriously as intellectual work the basic traditional tenets of feminism are important and valid women should have equal rights and safety but the quality of the intellectual work of recent decades is quite shoddy and consists primarily of attempts to twist the assumptions criteria and methods of intellectual work so that equality ends up being defined in heavily biased ways that knock down any advantage that men have and ignore any power and advantages that women have so that equality is equal on feminists' terms and only on feminists' terms the more benign excuse is that perhaps that women's studies majors need to keep themselves in steady employment and have to keep pushing the envelope further even though the bottom of it blew out long ago that would at least make the more extreme of them seem a bit less delusional but don't take my word for it go in with an open mind and a thick skin and trust your gut don't let the heavy approval witholding pressure get to you by all means do a little reading on phallocentrism before you make your foray get familiar enough with it so that you can give some thought to what uterocentrism would look like so you'll have a framework to put your experiences into when they don't seem to make sense or when the social pressure to knuckle under seems overwhelming and remember that there are many women out there who don't buy into this stuff good luck

do you think that cultural norms and expectations about masculinity can cause harm to men and women yes the idea that real men don't show emotions can cause all kinds of problems for men from health issues to mental stress the idea that men are tough and hard makes it difficult for them to back down if confronted they sometimes feel pressured to save face even if they don't want to fight they are still seen as the bread winners so they feel pressured to work over work and achieve the ever larger pay check often sacrificing spending time with their families which in turn often leads to them not getting custody of the children in the case of a divorce i see a lot of blaming going from both genders in regard to the challenges each faces from our respective social expectations and biases i think it's important that we all remember that one sex is not out to get or oppress the other that society has been this way a long time and that both sexes suffer from certain biases and expectations  Transsexuality Feminism Gender role Fathers' rights Sexual orientation Homophobia Marriage Feminist movement Domestic violence Reparative therapy Liberalism Rape Child sexual abuse Social rule Polyamory Boston Public Narcissism Gender identity Effeminacy Gender-neutral language Political correctness Human sexual behavior Ex-gay Japanese values Inflation Transgender Serial killer Theory of conduct Social justice Abortion debate Hikikomori Heteronormativity Anarchism Sexual abstinence Pedophilia Simone Weil The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex EastEnders History of sex Goodness and value theory Abortion in the United States Gender Homosexuality Intelligence quotient Generation X Modernism Economic inequality Carl Jung Dissociative identity disorder Cult Children of God Family Ethics Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Lie Combat stress reaction History of intersex surgery High-heeled shoe Infantilism Objectivist philosophy John Money Behavioral finance Bernard Williams Women in Islam Paraphilia Alex Ferguson Biology and sexual orientation Autism Affirmative action Transactional analysis Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Bulgarian language Democracy Fathers' rights movement in the UK Confucianism Androgen insensitivity syndrome Little Britain Islam as a political movement Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Abortion Culture Human Unemployment Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Philosophy of language Sex and the City Cross-dressing Asian fetish Child sexuality Intersexuality Leadership Witch-hunt

if feminist want men to judge by personality and not looks then y are most of them stuck up to men i posted something up earlier saying most feminist are unattractive and somebody says this to me i quote this they simply ask equality which you have proven to be unfulfiled since you have judged them by their physical aethetical appearance which is the calibre with which women are being rated judged for ages k so if you want us to judge you as a person inside then y do you act the way you do so even your personality is unattractive as well as the outside this goes to most feminist not all that person was me but i never told you to judge them by personality either i said never judge a cause by its activists i believe that any activist is an extremist a fanatic in pushing a cause nobody is ever proud of the activists of any cause they are simply doing a dirty job that somebody has to do which is simply making as much noise attracting as much attention as required in order to grabb the attention of the fluff oriented media it's a marketing promotion starategy so forget their image and even forget their personality and focus on the main issue they are promoting i believe that you love your mother your sister your partner your future or present daughter enough to wish them fair tolerant and prospectful life much respects  Gender role Physical attractiveness Asian fetish Human sexual behavior Masculism Sexual orientation Feminism Fathers' rights Fathers' rights movement in the UK Same-sex marriage Domestic violence Abortion debate Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Transsexuality Biology and sexual orientation Feminist movement Grimke Sisters Gender-neutral language Abortion in the United States Simone Weil EastEnders Civil rights Divorce Homophobia Polyamory Andrea Dworkin Plame affair Yoko Ono Pedophilia Mumia Abu-Jamal Bernard Williams Bisexuality Homosexuality and Christianity Reparative therapy Dead Like Me Autism rights movement Feminists for Life Theodicy Lesbian Transgender Internet troll Religion and sexuality History of women in the United States Pornography in Japan Sex-positive feminism Jane Fonda Fox News Body image Characters in the Smurfs Polygamy Fuel injection Homosexuality and transgender Roe v.

why do some feminists disregard men's perspectives on feminism men are about the population some of us really are trying to gain and give insights also if men really are in power shouldn't you be interested in the perspective of those in power i'm not talking about feminists that question men's perspectives i'm referring to feminists that disregard men's perspectives isn't it counterproductive to do this the pc movement idea that you have to be a member of an oppressed group to have real insight into that oppressed group's movement is very illogical if i drive a gas guzzler does that mean i can't utter correct words about saving the environment no it might make me a questionable source but this analogy is only a demonstration of the illogic of the victim mentality well portwine read carrie's answer as that says it all incoherent ideology feminist study is hard you can get a phd in it pseudo intellectualism and credentualism you can get a phd in religious studies also you can get one in an honorary fashion too this does not make the insights coming from these relativistic post modern social constructionist blowhards any more relevant ideologues have no use for the truth portwine why would they have use for your perspective i despair at their feeble attempts at scholarship but i take hope in the fact that their numbers and influence dwindles  Postmodernism Deconstruction Ideology Philosophy of language Masculism Logic Meme Fundamentalism Anarchism Feminist movement Power (sociology) Intelligent design movement Epistemology Anthropology Leo Strauss Reparative therapy Atheism Theology Domestic violence Radical feminism Franz Boas Political correctness Friedrich Nietzsche Social psychology G__del's incompleteness theorem Nazism Sex-positive feminism Second language acquisition Religion Rudolf Steiner New Testament Free will Sigmund Freud Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Germaine Greer Karl Marx Civil rights Terrorism Popular culture studies Historical materialism Feminist theology Capitalism Aikido Bernard Williams Cult Existentialism Marshall McLuhan Libertarianism Science Arthur Schopenhauer Socialist Workers Party (UK) Afrocentrism Robert A.

what's up with women who say they're heterosexual but say that the male anatomy is not attractive they say their straight not even bi but then say that male sexuality anatomy is a turn off or not as much of a turn on as the female anatomy if you call yourself straight but are not into your lovers body wouldnt you be better off to just masturbate is this why people have sex with the lights out im talking about women who say theyre straight but do not find the male body sexy were not talking about any certain parts here just the naked male body in general how can you say youre straight but be more turned on by the female anatomy have i seen a pair of testicals yeah girl i love them cannot for the life of me understand how people don't see the male anatomy as absolutley gorgeous every inch of it actually lycra spandex this particular q of mine was inspired by a poster named nanni earlier today she claims to be straight finds females hot and men gross your answer was fabulous ahh mojo changed her name hello simone i posed a similar question a few days ago delicious i'm assuming my question inspired you to write this question http answers yahoo com question index ylt ap os kvhsv b l wd qwvsy ix qid aatvyyp anyhow i think a lot of these women are too proud to admit they're turned on by male features and the male anatomy plus society tells women that thinking erotic thoughts especially erotic thoughts about a man is something to be shunned upon women often feel guilty if they find they're having erotic thoughts about a man's penis sounds silly to me then there's that social stigma that women are slutty if they associate with sex liking sex and seeking sex i wish women were as sexually free as men men openly admit they love vaginas breasts her butt etc another part of the reason why some straight women state that the male anatomy is unattractive while the female anatomy is attractive is due to the socialized conditioning of putting women on a beauty pedestal due to a male dominated society any form of appreciating the male anatomy is linked to being gay which is taboo among male heterosexuals to be gay is a direct attack on a heterosexual male's manhood in order to counter this notion male dominated society makes the male form seem silly undesirable irrelevant and to be ignored as a result not only do men believe this inclination but heterosexual women start to believe this about the male anatomy as well who's to say soft feminine curves are better than the strong masculine chisled body you can't it's apples and oranges both are attractive and can should be appreciated in their own particular ways even though the ads billboards music videos strip clubs and television featuring beautiful women is directed towards men many women as a result of this male centric media orgy have been conditioned brainwashed into believing that only the female figure is beautiful as well there was a time period when artists like michaelangelo and leonardo di vinci would draw or sculpt the male figure in this day and age it is much rare to see heterosexual male or female artists paint the male form we are told that the male form is unattractive and to be ignored i as a heterosexual male am secure enough to admit that the male form is appreciative i was on the swim team and wore tight spandex jammer shorts picture http www swimming cz images fsiijammer xl jpg and i must've lost count on how many women i caught oogling my package others told me later that they caught some women in the crowd looking at my rear side in these shorts if men wore tight pants with their bulges outlined women would stare just like men stare at breasts and women are always wearing tight tops for this reason the difference would be that the women would readily deny that they were staring don't believe me watch this video where they do an experiment with several women at a restaurant and the waiter is wearing tight spandex pants with a fake penis placed in his pants http www youtube com watch v drrf utfste then watch the lady at the end of the video that says that was so disgusting this is what i'm talking about women readily denying it in the video she was mesmerized and fascinated while staring at his penis and was looking hot and bothered and lost her concentration women are so full of s hit and are such hypocritical liars it's incredible just admit you love staring at penis just as much as men have no problem stating that they love staring at breasts the only woman being honest was the older woman that took off her coat because she said the displayed penis was getting her hot and she was holding her chest because her heart was fluttering she also said she was enjoying the sight how many women will get mad at me now that i've told the

why do most all women on internet dating sites sound like psychos and some of their opening lines are like i dont need a man in my life ok then wtf are you doing on a dating site trust me more men sound like psychos on these dating sites than do women i have a profile on passion com and have talked in the chat rooms off and on for awhile now and believe me the things that men say would blow you away there are plenty of normal women but few normal guys all the men seem to be after is sex and they don't care how or with whom and have little time for getting to know someone as a person first perhaps the women are being defensive to this common theme maybe they want more than just a one night stand maybe they don't like being objectified and maybe that's their way of letting others know it maybe they are playing hard to get for these reasons or others it's hard to say maybe if you got to know her better you'd find out  American Psycho Psycho Time Out of Mind Hearing impairment AFI 100 Years series Alfred Hitchcock Strap-on dildo Humphrey Bogart Avenue Q Cyberspace The Pet Sounds Sessions Friends Taxi Driver Internet phenomenon The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Rape Scenes from a Memory Toilet Can't Hardly Wait Group sex The Beatles discography Gay Jon Secada Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!

is is possible to love and respect women but not be a feminst many have stated that rejecting feminism and respecting women as equal partners are mutually exclusive can't do both at the same time do you agree with this if you agree are you saying that anyone that is not a feminist considers women second class citizens thinks that they are not people too don't deserve equal opportunities etc let me state for the record i have great love and respect for females of all ages and get it right back however i will not ever accept being characterized by anything that starts with fem and i am far from alone rico steve don't play dat if you want to accuse me stand up be a man and send me an email girly you know i respect you but i think you are off base on this one let me use myself as an example there are hundreds of females all ages who would testify under oath that i am i am not a feminist they have at no time ever witnessed me treat any female with anything less than due respect and consideration as a person based on her sex see not a feminist but still a person who loves and respects women there are millions of us out here one of the advantages is that i can chose to treat ladies categorically different better than i ever would a man without guilt benevolent sexism kind of like the best of both girly i was not intending to bash feminism rather unbashing non feminism girly economic equality certainly pay hire and fire equally politically sure it's a racket y'all can have it socially yes and no same rights but in practice not being a feminist frees me to treat women better than i do men you would call it sexism i'm not mean to men but i treat all the ladies in my life simply better socially than i treat they guys in kinder even more respectful way i know feminists don't shouldn't approve of that but that's one of several reasons i am not one if i were a feminist it would be wrong imo to treat women better than men so no i'm no feminist but that does not make me a bad guy kendrick i get you but i tried not to be too wordy i probably did not use the best choice of words thanks girly we're cool as always carrie in answer to your how can you love and respect based on physical characteristics i mean the principled kind of love no romantic also i am thinking of females that i know personally but in the broadest view i guess i would have to say respect is more accurate someone might consider me guilty of benevolent sexism but in all my years i have not gotten a single complaint the women i know seem to like it properly motivated wendy g i don't qualify equal is not the right term in my opinion i don't discriminate and try to treat all fairly but i also don't treat men and women equally at all times and in all circumstances it doesn't always work for me however i do know you are consistent with that which i highly respect equal means equal as well it should if you claim the feminist moniker no word essays justifying inequality when it suits your fancy but i am free to treat women and men categorically unequally when it seems appropriate i have hundreds friends and not a single one has ever said that my behavior toward any of them is anything but kind and respectful because of sex or race or anything else like that the good news is that i already have a toaster pythagoras are you a masculist no so then that that means that you do not want men to have equal rights why not what do you have against men see how unreasonable that position is just because you don't subscribe to masculism does not necessarily mean you don't want men to have equal rights feminism is no different i ain't one never was one and ain't never gon' be one and you can draw whatever conclusions you wish but that does not make them so my goodness will you guys please get over your damn stereotypes and stigmas long enough to learn for crying out loud yes that makes you a feminist forget what everyone else thinks feminists and anti feminists alike do you agree with the definition the belief in social political and economic equality of the sex es yeah plural if you disagree with this definition that makes you either a misandrist or a misogynist all definitions taken literally now do you fall within the stereotypes you have to figure that out for yourself but please don't let the stereotype keep you from equality if anything those who recognize the stereotype and disagree with it and actually do something about it instead of sitting around bitching about it yet still believe in the ideal can be the most beneficial to the cause

is there an inequity between mr and mrs right this is one of those more anecdotal things that seems to derive answers that try to invalidate my right to even ask the question if you compare the needs wants list of a man for romantic relationships and compare the needs wants list of a woman in romantic relationships you'll see some very distinct differences both quantitative and qualitative i would say that most men are looking for quality companionship and some sex with a partner they're attracted to wouldn't you say that men are really looking more for a lack of bad things than an abundance of good things in a woman compare that to what most women would put down on their honest list of needs wants and let me know what's fair about this hey maybe it isn't fair romantic thoughtful attractive make more money than me sensitive but not too sensitive chivalrous remind me i'm special all the time clean organized a decent cook into traveling and trying new things intelligent surprises me and on and on really the list could go on longer but i hope you get the point also men's need for quality companionship entails some of the same things that the woman's list does but it's not as elaborate and strict carrie is right there's probably a little more to quality companionship than i previously thought wendy g i think the truth is somewhere between our perspectives but i appreciate your articulate way of showing another perspective i think high expectations for being treated well should be a given but high expectations for harlequin romance situations are usually costly for all involved ka i appreciate you bringing me to a more centrist perspective but i suspect there are more women out there that have job description level criteria for the simple easy going men they'll end up with than you might think hmmm interesting question i'll add a different viewpoint than the rest let's consider the old fashioned traditional roles it used to be that a boy was raised told to go to college obtain a good degree find a great job then settle down with a woman to raise his kids hence the boy was raised to become his own independent person a girl used to be told to be pleasant and find a nice man to take care of her not much was spoken about going out there in the world being independent and taking care of herself even though there is more emphasis on educating young girls to be independent go to college establish herself there are still quite a bit of the old fashioned guidelines out there so let's focus on the list of wants since the man already has his own identity career job his requirements are likely to be less she just needs to be nice enough to be around if it doesn't work out he can go on with his life and find another it is much more critical to the woman that she doesn't make a mistake and choose a bad spouse if things don't work out she may not have the good college degree or great career to fall back on since she will likely end up with the kids it will put even more stress on her i actually know of some married couples where the woman has opted to stay home and raise children the wives did have degrees and good jobs before the choice but being out of work in many professional occupations means one loses a bit of their craft it would take more effort to find a new career should they become separated for some reason  Same-sex marriage Social rule Infantilism Theory of conduct Polyamory Sexual orientation EastEnders Economic inequality Gender role Marriage Avenue Q Pedophilia Goodness and value theory Theodicy Divorce About a Boy Friends Social psychology Human sexual behavior Ethics Economics The Apprentice 2 Polygamy Domestic violence Phoebe Halliwell Software engineering Human Scientology beliefs and practices Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Expert system Intelligence quotient Incarnations of Immortality Asperger syndrome Bernard Williams Zoophilia Inflation Abortion debate Education in the United States Epistemology Philosophy of language Extreme Programming Objectivist philosophy Age disparity in sexual relationships Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Species Political correctness Sinfest Free trade Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Capitalism Labor theory of value Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Little Britain Sex and the City Family name Poker jargon Education in the People's Republic of China One Tree Hill (TV series) Logic Eastern Orthodox Church Microeconomics Publicly funded medicine Fathers' rights Laura Schlessinger Mojave people Hey Jude Feminism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Religious Society of Friends Socrates Prisoner's dilemma Pitaten Meaning of life Surveillance Autism The Amber Spyglass Unemployment The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Sharon Tate Ocean's Twelve Procrastination Debugging Division of labour Scenes from a Memory Lie Religious conversion Leadership Past teachings of Prem Rawat Phaedo Alexander Technique

why don't women ask for more money we all know that men make more money than women do on average however a new study says the reason guys make more is because they complain and negotiate more than women a recent study found men were eight times more likely than women to negotiate for higher pay and that this is one of the major reasons for the pay disparity between the sexes on average men make percent more than women do with similar education and experience a lot of the issues with workplace unfairness is not conscious sexism nurse betty if you dont try you will never know you've hit the nail on the head yes there is inequity in pay but there is also inequity in negotiating skills between men and women by nature women are less likely to be confrontation within the workplace and will be less likely to ask for more money or be tough with their bosses about compensation instead of legislation there needs to be a training methodology for women to learn how to better negotiate and position themselves for higher earnings until that time the discussion of illegality is futile  Economic inequality Feminism Capitalism Masculism Intelligence quotient Israeli Arab Racism Minimum wage Credit card Education in the United States Contract Trade union Discrimination Conscription Sex and intelligence Employment law Insurance Sexual harassment Feminist movement Microeconomics Fox News Sexual orientation Homeschooling Democracy Gender gap Social Security debate (United States) Education in the People's Republic of China Smoking ban Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Mutual fund FairTax Labor theory of value Divorce Estoppel Salary cap Fathers' rights Women in Islam Health insurance Sexism Flat tax Tobacco smoking Abortion debate Edith Nourse Rogers Homophobia Gender role Gender-neutral language Sociology Graduate school History of post-Soviet Russia Texas Revolution Globalization Age of consent MMORPG Education in Japan Homemaker Blackjack Domestic violence Workplace democracy Dilbert Nurse Betty Debt Fertility awareness Education Toilet Race and intelligence Education in Portugal Franz Boas Libertarian socialism Androgen insensitivity syndrome Prostate cancer Minor league baseball Publicly funded medicine Workers' compensation Condom Humphrey Bogart Rick Santorum Oral sex Capital accumulation Dead Like Me St. Elmo's Fire (film) Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Equal Protection Clause Fred Phelps Condon Committee Tariff Nuclear power Motivation RuneScape quests Same-sex marriage 1994 baseball strike Sociolinguistics Voluntary Student Unionism Predatory lending Columbia University Breastfeeding Ultimate Spider-Man Bondage (BDSM) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus

what do you think of this checklist to identify female sex supremacists she is in favour of quotas which discriminate against men she is in favour of vawa which is formulated sex biased and is against a refraising of vawa to formulate it sex neutral she sees no wrong with the fact that in over of divorces custody is awarded to the woman and child support eviction and alimony is placed upon the man unlike with any other disparity where wome do not gain to go more into detail when the facts are mentioned that detail how men on average get harder sentences for killing their spouses or longer jailtime for similiar crimes as compared to women the typical female sex supremacists says that the cases must be viewed on a case by case basis however when there is a disparity in the working professional world trying to determine weather or not sexism is involved on a cases by case basis is no longer a valid option but sexism is assumed and quotas are called for to rectify said sexism she is in favour for and voicing for more perks zybagirl i do it to raise awarness mellie do you feel that vawa should be rendered sex neutral in content and titel vioence against people act i was referring to women quotas in general while quotas allow women to compete for of the avaiable spots a woman quota of say would mean that men can only compete for of the aviable spots and are therefore discriminated against wow at least you are knowledgeable in what you bring to the table as opposed to other questions about fat chicks you know i agree with you i don't think women who kill should get lighter sentences for some of the horrific things they do i think men should get a fair shake in the judicial system when it comes to custody hell i wanted to live with my dad because my mother was the abusive one now the violence against women i am for that i know men get abused too and that it's not in the spotlight like with us what do you mean though by quotas pertaining to what  Divorce Mediation Fathers' rights Masculism Marriage Homophobia Sexism Gender-neutral language Affirmative action Transsexuality Appeal Serial killer Sex Equal Protection Clause Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Rape Domestic violence Racism Constitution of Ireland Family Economic inequality Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Amnesty International Child support Pedophilia Capital punishment Cult Feminism Gender role Esperanto as an international language Child custody EastEnders Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Friends Federal Marriage Amendment Sexual orientation Unlawful combatant Polyamory Religion and sexual orientation Same-sex marriage in Canada Liberalism Parental Alienation Syndrome Gender identity European Convention on Human Rights Democracy Australian electoral system Feminist movement Homosexuality Intelligence quotient Contract Women in Islam Single Transferable Vote Israeli Arab Woman Infantilism White supremacy Fallacy Homosexuality and transgender Homosexuality and Christianity Fair use Theodicy Animal rights Polygamy Plame affair Discrimination John Wycliffe Arab-Israeli conflict Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Scientology beliefs and practices Adversarial system Civil rights Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Honor killing Voting system Religion Chuck Palahniuk Lawrence v.

hypothetical question if this category was called gender and men's studies which would be the subjects of discussion many times the question of why there is not a men's studies has been asked in this section my opinion is that all past academia studies have been men's studies therefore it was necessary to create the women's studies to give women their rightful place in history as well as concentrating in discrimination and many other social issues but what if a new academia section of men's studies were created in social science which would be the subjects of study and why ok everybody don't get carried away now yes traditional curriculum used to focus solely on the accomplishments of men a point made by dale spender it would be possible to graduate from advanced mathematics classes without knowing that women ever participated let alone excelled in this area spender however this has changed a lot thanks to feminism current textbooks contain information on the historical contributions of both genders also according to karen lehrman a women's rights activist who disagrees with gender academia most of the women's studies courses are designed not merely to study women but also to improve the lives of women both the individual students the vast majority of whom are female and women in general lehrman while i disagree with her about the validity of gender studies she makes an interesting point in that she explains that the study of women is not exclusive to studying their history it is also an indication that a female friendly environment is positive towards a female student s self esteem and their sense of identity these programs help women to better understand who they are as people not just their histories yet traditional curriculum doesn t focus on the identity of the student in the way that women s studies programs do from this perspective you could say that men are being excluded from programs that could help them better understand themselves and their place in society by studying their own identity because in the majority of academic institutions men are not being provided with an equivalent to the study of women a study of males or masculinity basically as anyone who has taken any women's studies course knows it is an environment where curriculum focuses not so much only the historical accomplishments of women but rather what that also means for the individual student today identity as women is focused on and often counsel from female mentors is available through these programs all wonderfully beneficial in essence i think its a mistake to simply argue that the only reason ws exists is to balance traditional curriculum when we know that it is beneficial for many more reasons and why shouldn't men be able to reap the rewards of these benefits by having their own realm of academia  Feminism Sexual orientation Gender Economics Postmodernism Gender-neutral language Philosophy of language Affirmative action Feminist movement Psychology Gender role Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Civil rights Gender identity Science Deconstruction A Course In Miracles Theory of conduct Anthropology Social psychology Sociology GED Economic inequality Education in Japan Masculism Academia Biology and sexual orientation Master's degree Education in Portugal Secondary education in Japan Same-sex marriage History of intersex surgery Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Futures Studies Software engineering Alternative medicine Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Juris Doctor Transsexuality Human Intelligent design movement Transgender Professor Reparative therapy Homophobia Intelligent design Creation-evolution controversy History Lawyer Political correctness Altruism Sex Franz Boas IB Diploma Programme Cognitive science Goodness and value theory Race and intelligence Abortion debate Second language acquisition Mathematics Graduate school Theology Logic Cross-dressing Tripartite System Discrimination Teach the Controversy Lawrence Summers Massachusetts Institute of Technology Liberalism John Lott Sociocultural evolution Noam Chomsky Extreme Programming Ethics Capitalism Property (ownership right) Center for Science and Culture Animal rights Hampshire College Domestic violence Education in Taiwan Autism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Anti-intellectualism SAT Indigenous peoples

how do you feel about self righteousness it's a perfectly legitimate to feel strongly about and argue one's viewpoint however it's quite another to dogmatically say that if one is not a feminist that means that they definitely do approve of women being sexually harassed abused being second class citizens of not being of equal worth as men etc etc not only are these statements untrue they belie a self righteousness usually only associated with persons who refuse to even consider any facts that might call their dogma into question what do you think about statements and insinuations like these mollypop i hope that is the case but this has been stated or insinuated countless times here david i don't name names or anymore post links that single people out but it has been said in so many words many times the point has been made perfectly clear david see maddocks answer maddocks thank you you've made my point right her first let me be clear i ain't no fem nothin there is not a single thing fem about me not a feminist feminine female none of that secondly your statement is that if a person believes the above statements about women not being abused etc they must be a feminist therefore if they are not a feminist they must not believe those things anyone else that is wondering what i am talking about this is an insinuation however others have made the same statements even more clearly david see the third answer here david as i said i will not name names or post links but there have been plenty of people who have said that right here not sure why you haven't seen these postings maybe you don't want to the answerer here said softly that if one believes in equality etc that makes one a feminist i disagree of course however if her preposition is true what if you are not a feminist do you really not see this or are you choosing to ignore it hallousness what's wrong with an actual defintion i assumed that a reader did not know what self righteous means they could look it up themselves in seconds how can you reasonably select one synonym rather than a definition and run with the synonym that does not apply in this context once you picked the synonym that you like but does not fit into this context i stopped reading david just noticed a better example please see hallousd's answer below that states it even more clearly here a feminist stating that if you are not a feminist you do not believe in equality etc david which of your statements is true i ve never come across of feminist who said that or yes i have seen the odd feminist say if you're not a feminist you don't believe in equality i have not changed my argument but you have secondly my statements are simply based on the many feminists here who have stated the above just like hallousd below not a preconception his hers is a fine example of what plenty of what many feminists right here in this forum have stated and this aint got nothin to with patriarchy matriarchy or any other feminist inspired archy jargon this sort of self righteousness is hate speech and insulting to the of the world that do not consider themselves feminists i am not anything that ends in ist and i will never be described as anything starting with fem despite loving and being loved by many many dozens of females bijou i like answers some of the people are nice and i don t mind a nice healthy debate it is boring to discuss topics with people with whom you already completely agree what is there to be learned from that i stumbled onto this forum and got stuck here out of my curiosity about what people who call themselves feminists really think are you saying that the people who claim to be feminists here are not it is also a place where others gather so there is also some perspective though the huge number of silly questions is an annoyance david you're right i have no idea what you are talking about self righteous adj piously sure of one's own righteousness am heritage dict nd coll ed it's not about hypocrisy per se but about certainty one who never questions his or her own ethical assumptions is prone to self righteousness questioning the conventional assumptions of our day might involve questioning whether non violence is an adequate ethical principle one might question whether damage to the soul isn't just as bad as physical damage and one might question whether the ambiguity in the definitions of violence aren't fatal to its relaibility as an ethical principle violence n physical force exerted for the purpose of violating damaging or abusing violent adj marked by or resulting from great physical force or rough action both from am her nd coll ed the former is ethically charged while the latter is morally neutral some feminists and some others have played fast and loose with the definitions of violence expanding it to include not only any application of physical force generally whether great or not but also to include any behavior that may be said to induce a feeling of fear with no qualification for paranoia or other emotional self indulgence of a sort analogous to a nursed grudge secondary anxiety or depression etc derrida included judging and name calling as metaphysical violence harrassment is a similarly abused term non self righteous people are open minded enough to know that human fallibility demands the toleration of difficult discussions of ethical fundamentals without immediately questioning the motives or integrity of those who disagree with them in other times violence was considered bad only when it was unjust violence but moral absolutism and categorical condemnation of physical force has come to many corners of feminism not only as regards the fundamentals but also to more practical ethical issues the reason for bringing this up isn't to attack non violence but to present a repugnant take on fundamentals to show how hard it is to tolerate the questioning of assumptions in my experience only a small minority of feminists are willing to question their assumptions the rest piously sure of themselves are to some degree self righteous one point missed above is that if one is an anti feminist then one is assumed to be anti woman as if the ideology cluster that is feminism is identical with women's interests this denigration isn't as clear if one is simply a non feminist feminism is nominally concerned with equality but feminists define their own criteria of power and conveniently omit the powers of the sort that men have complained about for centuries manipulative powers in emotional and sexual matters emotional manipulation does get discussed as the chief manifestation of girl's bullying but only insofar as it affects other girls to define feminism as a concern with equality is a very generous bit of defining but the actions of feminists on the ground speak louder than dictionaries on this point one should consider the difference of the kind of lexical term that holds between self righteousness and feminism feminism refers to a movement whose actions define its members more than any stipulations while self righteousness refers to a specific sort of unpleasant behavior whose definition is uncontroversial but whose predication of any particular person might be and equality may be at bottom a mathematical concept but it can be applied or not to myriad dimensions of human affairs and these applications can be fair or unfair one could say that there ought to be equal numbers of women in jail as men as fairly as feminists say that women ought to take home as much money as men without their having to work as many hours as long at the same job or in equally risky jobs there is plenty of reason to at least question whether feminism is manifestly about equality or fairness but in criticising feminism one is often met with accusations of one's being anti woman or trying to justify the oppression of women and then there's the matter of whether feminism really does serve women's best interests millions of women don't think so

why is the issue of domestic violence so intricately woven with feminism not saying it should or shouldn't be and i get the history but why are dom vio academic studies so closely related to gender studies why not psychology psychiatry sociology law or criminal justice i've always been curious why gender academia seems to focus on this issue more than the other social sciences academic disciplines your thoughts phil i'm sorry to say but i'm losing respect for you by the minute i had seen you as an answerer who could remain level headed and view the facts but this is now the rd answer i have seen you push an agenda disregarding fact many forms of domestic violence were legal throughout history in ancient greece men had absolute power over their wives and children meaning their family was their property and these men were given the power to kill their wives and children if they saw the need for it as punishment for adultery etc english commonlaw stated the rule of thumb men could beat their wives or children as long as the rod was no bigger than the circumfrence of his thumb also in english commonlaw if a woman was raped the restitution was paid to the father or husband not the woman bc women were the property of these men btw most forms of english commonlaw were inherited by america mississippi reasonable physical chastizement of wives and daughters is permissible by law maryland maryland becomes the first state to enact law against wife beating now these are just a few blurbs i have written down from a college level domestic violence course which btw my prof was very much opposed to feminist power and control theory favoring social learning theory and shame theories phil i appreciate your posts most of the time but lately you are becoming extremist in that your ideas are so anti feminism that you cannot even see the positives of it and how it has helped changed a very negative society i know you disagree with how it has evolved but nothing is ever all bad or all good please don't fall party to anti feminist propaganda or feminist propaganda for that matter if you do you become no better than the radicals take care and good luck to you i think part of it is because until the laws were changed as a result of the feminist movement it was completely legal to physically or sexually assault a wife yep beating or raping your wife used to be legal who in the fields of psychology sociology law or criminal justice was advocating for a law to protect married women from abuse my guess is that's why it's linked with feminism  Marriage Feminism Same-sex marriage Ethics Polygamy Rape Abortion debate Civil rights Women in Islam Religion and sexuality Sociology Gender role Anarchism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Fathers' rights Sigmund Freud The Handmaid's Tale Social psychology Feminist movement Homosexuality Human sexual behavior Masculism State Bernard Williams Liberalism Anarcho-capitalism Science Theory of conduct Democratic Party (United States) Academia Transsexuality Plame affair Spanking Woman Human sexuality Gender Philosophy of language Deconstruction Gay rights Sharia Infantilism Capital punishment History of sex Economic inequality Law Incest Non-aggression principle Prostitution Family Software engineering Child sexual abuse Psychology History of women in the United States Lynching in the United States Law of the People's Republic of China Homosexuality and Christianity Sexual orientation Abortion in the United States Logic Opposition to cults and new religious movements Homophobia Social sciences Pornography Gender-neutral language Coercion Originalism Political philosophy Property (ownership right) Radical feminism Rabbi Affirmative action Education in the United States Anti-psychiatry Michel Foucault Andrea Dworkin Postmodernism Libertarianism Zoophilia Democracy Corporal punishment Pedophilia Reparative therapy Lawrence v.
