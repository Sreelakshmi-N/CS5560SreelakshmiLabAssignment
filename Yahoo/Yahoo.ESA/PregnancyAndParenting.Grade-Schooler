how can i get the school to see that this isn't a problem my daughter is and going into the second grade she has friends and enjoys playing and interacting with friends but at times she will prefer to sit alone to read work and sometimes to eat she's not teased and she is able to form close friendships but the school keeps making a big deal out of the fact that at times she likes to be alone even going so far as to say she needs intervention and counseling so they send her to the school counselor once a week i would see this a problem if it was all the time but it's not when she wants be alone she chooses to be alone and when she wants company she chooses to go hang out with other kids she also has a very defined sense of personal space and only lets one or two very close friends hug her or sit stand close to her i don't see it as being a problem but the school and her teachers keep acting like it is has anyone else had a situation where the school sees a problem but you don't and how did you deal with it even the principal pushes the counseling and we did consent finally i don't think the counseling is doing her any harm my daughter sees it as getting to leave the classroom and go play with a nice lady and a couple of other kids which basically is what it is and the counselor doesn't seem to think my daughter has any real issues i just wish that at every conference with a teacher i didn't have to hear how she's still not socializing enough or not intiating interaction with other kids in pre school she woudln't talk to other kids at all and it was at the same school so i'm afraid that since she was labelled in pre school she'll have to carry that label with her we are supposed to be moving soon so maybe with a new school she can shake that label and the teachers won't be watching her so closely waiting for her to mess up in their opinion have you talked to the principal sometimes that helps she's your kid not theirs so they shouldn't be able to make her go to counseling without your permission i would also explain to them that they aren't really promoting individuality but instead making it seem like there's something psychologically wrong with her because she's not acting or doing all of the things that the other kids do in the end they could potentially end up making her feel like there's something wrong with her in a bad way and then really mess her up psychologically  Theory of conduct Social rule Shaggy dog story Pitaten Domestic violence Plame affair Ranma __ characters Kodocha Transactional analysis Boston Public Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Milton H.

do you think its okay for year olds to wear heavy perfume makeup and grown up clothes i am asking this question on behalf of my almost year old step daughter she thinks her father and i are just being mean over at her mom's house her mom lets her wear revealing clothes and makeup eyeshadow mascara and lipstick i don't mean gloss her mom also lets her wear and bring home heavily perfumed body washes shampoo powders and perfume itself my step daughter is fighting us on this because she thinks its okay my husband and i keep trying to tell her its okay once in a while but not for everyday at her age more for dress up she says were just mean and other parents wouldn't think this way even though none of her friends dress this way or wear makeup and perfume any thoughts either way before i choose a best answer i would like to thank everyone for their oppinions while i agree with some and don't agree with others all are appreciated i think seeing these answers really opened my daughters eyes and to those of you who don't find anything wrong with it god help you when you have kids a year old should definitely not being wearing heavy perfume makeup and grown up clothes i think it's a real problem and her mom is completely irresponsible to encourage her to dress in this way kids already grow up too fast now and are exposed to things they shouldn't even know about in the community i live in there is a girl who started wearing revealing tight clothes had her hair high lighted and acted like a teenager when she was in rd grade she's now going into th grade she's sexually active and often seen walking around with groups of boys since your step daughter's mom obviously has no sense then it's up to you and your husband to keep her from this kind of behavior when she is with you if possible then your husband should discuss this issue with his ex and let her know how strongly he feels about it and why he feels that way i have a feeling she won't listen to him but it's worth a try in the mean time just be sensible stick to your rules and explain to her why you don't allow it and let her know there is no compromising on this issue  Calvin and Hobbes Theory of conduct Clothing Jennifer Lopez Laura Schlessinger Recurring South Park characters Hijab Milton H.

crazy adopted year old girl we just adopted a little year old girl and she has been a little angel until today she started going nuts breaking everything talking back bullying the younger kids i dont know what to do with her she has been spanked by her other parents but should i i tried taking away some toys putting her in the corner nothing works i didnt want to spank her like i do my other kids but she is going nuts she also cusses at school and at me so should i spank or not and with what i cant with the hand she bites i dont know what to do please help i dont want to spank her because she was abused badley when she was little and im scared something wrong will happen im going to try taking her to a counselor or something if that doesnt work ill probably spank her but thxs yall i agree with everyone who said to get her counseling you have no idea of every thing she may have been through in her life before you adopted her you have some idea but it could be ten times worse it's very possible that until now she was unsure of her place in your home so was being on her best behavior but now she feels more secure so she isn't suppressing her emotions and needs an outlet to vent ask your pediatrician for a referral to a child psychiatrist i think you are doing the right thing by not spanking her but maybe you should also not spank your other children it might scare her to know that you do or she could think that she can get away with more because they get spanked and she doesn't try to find a good fair punishment that can be used for all of your children when they misbehave good luck  Spanking Kodocha Child abuse Theory of conduct Pitaten Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder James Dobson EastEnders Friends Milton H.

what do you think ok so my son loves video games and will be so lazy and not go to the bathroom and hold his pee until he just pees his pants he is because that game is so important if he is at home he will go and change clothes and not until i do laundry to i find out this has happened then i go and fuss at him we have cut game time down to hour a day now at home and we do moniter that but he spent the night with a friends and apparently they played and played and played and he once again held it and when i got there he was in the bathroom i waited and waited and went and checked on him and he has peed his pants i was so aggervated i made him wear them home to show his dad i said put your shoes on and lets go and he tried to throw a fit and was embaressed i said nope lets go maybe this will teach you a lesson well his friends mom is very upset saying i should have never done that and that is degrading and so forth just wondering what yall think i do not feel it was unfair to him what you did was perfectly fair some mother's are just dramatic and over protective and that's ok but he will not learn if you don't start doing something about it and that was a good start also i would take the game away for a little bit he will be a very big brat about this my son is the same way but it has to be done tell him to occupy his time with anything other than tv and video games if he starts acting good reaward him with like minutes one day and then if he went to the bathroom and was good that day and the next make it alittle longer the next day tel him the next time he does it though you will sale his game and not buy a new one it sounds harsh but we had to do it and he really changed good luck girl and i hope this works out for you  Social rule The Jazz Singer Friends Grandview, U.S.A.

question about my son and kindergarten here is the situation my son is going to be five on august my husband and i have decided not to send him to kindergarten until he is six my husband was a late summer baby as were two of my younger brothers and they all struggled in grade school i have enrolled him in pre k at our local school here which is the same schedule as half day kindergarten i do think that he needs something to do since he will be five now though my grandparents my friends a lot of people are telling me that i am making a huge mistake by not sending him to kinder this year so for parents who have been through this what do you think the reason my friends and family are objecting is because they say he is smart enough well he is he knows his abc's can count to etc the reason i really decided to hold him back was because i do have some reservations about him emotionally and socially he also has a hard time with small motor skills like writing his name he struggles really hard to just accomplish it he shows no interest in coloring would rather be playing trucks or throwing a ball i am told this is very common for boys our pre k program here is very academically based they will be learning math how to read ect it not just a pre school maybe that is what my family and friends don't understand the reason my friends and family are objecting is because they say he is smart enough well he is he knows his abc's can count to etc the reason i really decided to hold him back was because i do have some reservations about him emotionally and socially he also has a hard time with small motor skills like writing his name he struggles really hard to just accomplish it he shows no interest in coloring would rather be playing trucks or throwing a ball i am told this is very common for boys our pre k program here is very academically based they will be learning math how to read ect it not just a pre school maybe that is what my family and friends don't understand the

would rather be playing trucks or throwing a ball i am told this is very common for boys our pre k program here is very academically based they will be learning math how to read ect it not just a pre school maybe that is what my family and friends don't understand i have no idea why the additonal details posted three times sorry guys computer is freaking out on me well my first reason for answering your question is because my birthday is also august next is because some of the issues you're describing sound like my daughter she was born in january so she was fine to start but it didn't go so well she has a lot of social problems some fine motor issues only with bilateral activities and severe sensory issues i think you are correct for not sending him you're the mother you take care of him every day these other people are a small part of his life and grandparents are the worst everything i do with my kids is wrong in the eyes of my parents on another note if he is struggling to write it may hurt and he may not have developed a decent grip yet he could also have low muscle tone or just weak hands in that position this first link is where i get most of my daughter's stuff on the left side there are links and you want to look at fine motor fun finger strengtheners and handwriting when he uses crayons make sure they're broken into smaller pieces which helps promote the proper grip with pencils also use smaller ones with a big fat grip on them our favorite being the jumbo pencil grip also instead of having him sit to color or write tape the paper to a wall or use an easel or chalk board because that position also encourages proper grip one really good activity is using theraputty expensive and you can make your own putty and hiding the little pieces from a lite bright and he has to use his fingers to find all the pieces and then re hide them does he write too hard if so he may need more 'input' to feel the pencil you could use a vibrating pen which is also really fun to use because is makes squiggles or weighted things on his pencil they also have raised line paper to help see and feel where the lines are or colored line paper you could do yourself for better visual clues does he write too light something weighted or a pressure sleeve helps and again the same activities as above for the colored line paper use college ruled paper and trace the first line blue middle line leave and don't dash and the bottom line is green to write right start at the sky and pull down to the ground http www therapyshoppe com index php i unoffically homeschool my kids and i use these sites a lot i found with my daughter she needs a few worksheets to do before she's really ready to write right sometimes she just needs to scribble to work out any cramps or antsy ness use this year to work with him on his handwriting not penmenship and lots of social stuff outside of te preschool http www dltk kids com http www coloringbookfun com http www tlsbooks com

how do i explain life lessons my daughter serious answers only please my daughter is seven years old lately she has been wanting to dress inappropriate for her age i have a niece who is a teenager and wears clothing i would never allow my daughter to wear but my little girl looks up to her how do i explain age appropriately how this makes other girls look or how dangerous this could be her father and i are somewhat old fashioned but i do let her have some say in her clothes i feel like she thinks we are being mean by making her change and i want her to feel confident in what she is wearing only without showing to much i understand your problem with the child she can not understand the implications and you can not even explain it to her cool the best way is to lay rules because kids easily understand rules and limits than freedom explanations hardly work with children normally the negative words do not impact much with kids when you tell to a kid do not go out kids easily understand do go out if you tell you should not wear these dresses the next immediate question will be why not and the answers will for sure very difficult for us and for them too so try to address that the dress that we bought gives an angel look to you and a jean with a t shirt gives a responsible look to you as you are already responsible from your question i understood that you your husband have a decent dressing culture thats first to be apreciated parents are the first roll models to the kids i have seen many parents do with so called attractive dresses and finally blame their kids that go a way above them parents should stay roll models and also the direction makers so nothing harm in making rules once a kid used to for certain way dressing at his her to years of age mostly the same pattern will stay for ever so this is the right time for you to bring your child in the right dressing way  Infantilism Gender role Transactional analysis Sharon Tate Second language acquisition Hijab Religion Catechism Kilt Franz Boas Clothing Scientology beliefs and practices Past teachings of Prem Rawat Jean Grey Good Times Fashion Incest EastEnders Cult Cultural relativism Paris Hilton Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Grunge music Anorexia nervosa Expert system About a Boy Saved by the Bell Marilyn Monroe Motivation Cross-dressing Sola fide Comanche Santa Claus Creationism Sexual orientation History of subcultures in the 20th century The Critic Child Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Domestic violence Sento Intelligent design movement Child pornography Psychology Skirt and dress Undergarment My Life as a Teenage Robot Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shirt One Tree Hill (TV series) Kodocha Philosophy of mathematics Androgen insensitivity syndrome Ludwig Wittgenstein Megan Griffin Skinhead Calvin and Hobbes Science SMTV Live Recess (TV series) Goth Extreme Programming Socrates Mary Wollstonecraft Daria Polyamory Parkour The Human Stain Civil rights Sigmund Freud Social rule Goodness and value theory Corset High school subcultures Parapsychology Jumpstart 3rd Grade Recurring South Park characters Narcissism Culture of the United States Numerology Nudity Predestination Gurkha Contingent David Beckham Creationist cosmologies Incarnations of Immortality Moral Politics God Doctor (Doctor Who) Jennifer Lopez Code: Lyoko English grammar Strategic management

year old my little sister lies about everything what people say do what happened my mom and dad are denile and say im lying to get her in trouble what do i tell my parents i keep getting in trouble for things i didnt do because of her she doesnt play with barbies or bratz try sitting down and talking to your little sister maybe she's trying to get attention of some sort and this is just a inconvenient effort to do so years old is by far old enough to understand that lying is wrong explain to her that you love her very much and it hurts your feelings when she says things that aren't true about you ask her how she would feel if you said things that weren't true about her ask her if you've done something to upset her and also remind her that 'big girls' don't lie most importantly set a good example treat her nicely spend time with her as her older sister you play a very important role in her life it sucks that your parents don't want to help you with this but if she continues to do it just try not to overreact and get defensive remember that she's only years old and it's surely a phase that will pass calmly reassure your parents that what she's saying is a fib but i think if you just keep chatting with her about it the problem should fix itself  Theory of conduct Social rule Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Avenue Q Transactional analysis About a Boy Philosophical skepticism Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Pok__mon Live!

what do i do please answer mi question recently i got in a fight at school and im suspended for days i would have been expellled but since i was povoked they did not i'm in the th grade and school has been back in for about a week i've never been in a fight before and i've never even gotten one detention or anything the reason i got into a fight was because this girl named alana kept teasing me in class she called me names like dummy loser the b words and all sorts of names but she never got in trouble not once because she never does it in front of teachers but this time she did and in front of my whole class she has been bullying me for years so finally i had enough and i punched her many times in the face until the teacher pulled me off of heri would have kept going if she hadnt stopped me they brought her down to the nurses office and she was bleeding all ove her face they called my mom and sent me home and now my com grounds me for the whole week and i only have minues too go on my laptop eachday its not it's not even fair that i got in trouble and her mom called my mom today to tell her off and make her pay the medical bills from when she toook her to the hospital because apparently i broke her jaw and damaged her eye and now im scared and dont know what to do her riends and her are probly going to try to fight me i dont know what to do please help im really sorry for hurting her but i wasnt thinking i called her today and her mom cursed me out she told me that her daughter didnt say anything mean to me and that im a low life brat im scared and i tried to say i was sorry but they dont want to hear it sweetheart violence is never the answer but the damage has already been done you have now shown her friends that you are not afraid of the bully the thing with bullies is that they are cowards deep down and when they don't have an audience they are too afraid to start anything i would be willing to bet that she had an audience every time she was bullying you anyway when you do go back to school she may even try to become your friend because now she fears your anger just let it go don't stoop to her level you be the better person if someone is bullying you in the future just walk away and ignore it if it gets out of hand report it to the teacher let the school board handle it and they will the schools are cracking down on bullying now it been going on too much because you say her parents want your parents to pay the doctors bills i assume you live in the usa because health care is not free there so unfortunately your parents will have to pay for it even if the other parents take your parents to court your parents will loose and have to pay it's a hard lesson to learn but hopefully you have learned it now and you will be a better person for it when you go back to school  Great Teacher Onizuka Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Columbine High School massacre Kodocha Boston Public One Tree Hill (TV series) Breastfeeding The Adventures of Pete & Pete Pok__mon Live!

what are good chores for my yr old daughter my daughter is yrs now i think that it time for her to start learning responsibilities and start doing some basic chores she is at that age where she complains if she is told to do something and expects a lot yes she has been a little bit spoiled other than that she is a very good kid but needs to learn that life is not all about the gimme's and that she needs to earn the things she wants we live in a bed apartment and we have a cat what type of chores is good for her at her age i just want some ideas i don't want to give too much or too little chores and was wondering what other parents do too as to lisa sterwert i am a very good mother and care for my children very well and definitely not a pathetic excuse of anything ignorant comment ignorant comment from an ignorant person i would appreciate input from people who have kids of their own thank you here's what my mom used to do when ever she was doing any work like peeling potatoes she would put a chair next to her and i would help when she baked the chair was there and i helped she used to sing to me all the time we were working together i learned to love those special times it wasn't a chore it was spending time with my mom she is gone now and that time is huge in my memory so when you dust give your daughter a duster too and say some thing like lets dust and when you do laundry get ther to help you by saying let's sort laundry she will look on this as her time with you and at the same time she will be learning and eventually she will be able to do things on her own and not grumble about it explain why you do housework and why you need to keep things clean i'm sure she will understand if as you say she has been spoiled you did the spoiling and you can't expect her to jump right in and be mommies little helper now you must do the training slowly and with fun and song because of what my mom did i am a good housekeeper and so are my daughters whom i taught the same way good luck  Great Teacher Onizuka Social rule Friends Milton H.

school im worried how manny kids get dropped of a block away from their home in middle school and is it dangerous to be dropped off that far away and i have been to public school my whole life and this year its public school im scared that the kids wont like me biggest mistake most new kids make acting shy the kids can think you are stuck up i know it doesn't make sense but try acting as outgoing as you ever felt don't worry your ears won't fall off if they don't fall in love with you on day one you probably need time to get to know them to are you in danger when you are dropped off were you in private school first your question says public both times i really think you can't worry over stuff out of your controll if you see a problem speak up to someone like your parents or teachers but otherwise coming from someone who went from private to public school it's gonna seem scary loosen up because they for some reason do not seem to know it is scary for you they seem to want to know everything about you with no reservations you are more than capable of doing this just focus on being as outgoing as you have ever been not fake mind you just your most bubbly self i hope that helps  The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Social rule The Fairly OddParents Time Out of Mind Hey Arnold!

how do i get my year old daughter not notice differences my year old daughter constantlly points things out loudly in public examples she told one lady that she has big teeth asked a woman with a large tummy if she was pregnant said something about someone in a wheel chair points out peoples age and race she does not mean to be rude and doesnt say the statements in negative ways more of an observation and i'm sure this is somewhat normal but i dont like it and do not know how to make her stop this help my five year old son has always been like this too when he was i was teaching him colors and he'd point and say this is green or that is black well one day we walked into walmart and the greeter was a friendly old black lady well my son pointed to her and said very loudly mommy that lady is brown i felt horrified but the lady was so sweet she just said yes honey i am and you are white that satisfied him and we went on i think if you tell them that yes they are noticing these things and that they are all normal then the child won't make a scene the same things happen to my husband and i when we are out and see kids he is only ' and children never fail to yell out things like mommy or daddy look at that little man look how little he is things like that generally the parents try to shush the child or ignore them which only results in the child being louder my husband is a good sport about it he usually laughs it off and tells the child that he just didn't grow very tall but that they probably will grow much bigger than him my son recently pointed out a man in a wheel chair and asked why he didn't walk he was just as loud as ever and i quickly explained to him how some people can't use their legs and that's how he gets around i've found that most people will be more interested in how you handle the situation than what the child said to them if you give the child an honest answer that makes sense to them then the subject is usually dropped immediately  Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha Social rule Jam (TV series) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Milton H.

how can i get my yr old to bed at pm i have a yr ol and she wants to stay up and play with him it time to start school we all need more sleep its hard to get her to bed at night its usually pm and too late for me makes me tired she could be overtired making her irritable and less able to wind down pm sounds quite late to me if she is active during the day pm might be a better time anyway whatever bedtime you decide you have to be consistent and stick to it start a strict bedtime routine bath pyjamas on and kisses goodnight for anyone else in the house into bed and you or partner read her a story then you turn out the light if she doesn't like the dark use a dim nightlight or have the hall light on say goodnight kiss her and leave the room for the first few nights you may have to sit outside as she may keep getting up if she does take her by the hand softly say 'it's bedtime' and take her back to bed if she struggles pick her up put her in and leave if she gets straight back up you put her straight back in after a couple of times say nothing at all to her as you put her back in and don't even give her eye contact are you in the uk have you ever watched 'house of tiny terrors ' some of those kids get put back to bed dozens and dozens of times but eventually they get the message stay there and go to sleep you must be consistent if she is used to being able to stay up she will try and get up to see if she can get you to give in again don't no matter how many times you have to put her back in bed the first few nights keep persevering as it really will get better also on the first night you start your strict routine you could explain to her you want her to go to bed when she is told and if she does and stays there she gets a reward sticker small toy sweets something small don't bribe her with that if she keeps getting up though don't get into conversations just say 'it's bedtime' or nothing at all and put her back in her bed in the morning if she didn't get up when you put her to bed give her the treat if she did get up explain that the treat was for staying in bed so she can't have it today but she will be able to try hard that night basically this is all about staying calm ignoring any playing up by simply puting her back in bed with minimal communication and rewarding any behaviour she displays that you do want to see  Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog training The Shining (film) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sleep Shaggy dog story 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Social rule Aerial (dance move) The Amber Spyglass James Hanratty Kodocha The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Daylight saving time Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Mattress Electrophysiology Otello Poker jargon Insomnia Calvin and Hobbes Avenue Q EastEnders Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Fancy Crane Milton H.

how can i get my son to be more interested in school he is in st grade he seems distracted and his behavior is silly he gets along great with others class clown i think all the teachers have him targeted at the kindergarten conference the teacher said to us that we are ideal parents so that was a huge compliment i just wish he could respect people and listen better i don't feel he takes pride in his work he is a smart child though i think that the teachers know that he is a handful but they all seem to like him and us i just want first grade to be great for all of us also what is the best answer to say to a teacher when she tells me there was problems with him today in class first of all the fact that you want your child to do well at school and improtantly respect his teachers is a great way of instilling a good attitude into him you are still one of his main educators and as long as he sees you giving people respect and listening to them then gradually he will learn how to do so himself you sound like a very positive role model for your child the fact that the teachers like him suggest to me that there are no serious concerns about his behaviour you say his behaviour is silly but that he gets along well with others most teachers i know have the biggest problems with children who are mean to others hit them etc if your son is just being a little irritating this sounds quite normal for a year old boy and he probably will grow out of it an important thing to remember is to back his teacher up teachers with disruptive children sometimes find they punish them only to have the child turn round the next day and say something like 'my dad said not to take any notice of you and i am allowed to do that if i want ' if this happens the child will not learn to settle down and behaviour will get worse this is obviously not an issue with your family just continue ensuring your son sees you listening to the teacher telling you about things he has done don't get panicked if she says there was a problem teachers have to talk to a different parent about various things practically every day and it is not a reflection on your parenting skills just listen to what she tells you thank her for letting you know about it and assure her that you will talk to your son at home then when you get home make sure you make time to do this discussing what he did how that made his teacher feel what he should do the next day etc have him sit by himself for a few minutes to think about his actions at school the next day when you take him to school ask him to go and apologise to the teacher first thing because he can then start the day afresh if you feel the teacher is speaking to you quite regularly after school ask her to timetable a time when you can both discuss your concerns in a little more depth don't worry about this it is part of her job to communicate with parents and as you sound very polite and keen to help your son she will be happy to speak with you during the meeting listen to the main problems she has been having with your child at school and don't be afraid to write them down as you will want to talk to your son about them ask her for her suggestions about how she can implement behaviour management strategies in school and how you could support them at home she might use a sticker chart and if he gets a certain amount of stickers you could give him a treat at hime or if he doesn't get enough you could take away a privilege as for not taking pride in his work he is and a boy not being sexist but they usually are messier writers than girls if he tends to rush through tasks do activities with him at home that will help his concentration level play 'pairs' turning over pairs of cards to find that match play 'kim's game' putting items on a tray for him to memorise then taking some away and asking him to name them read him stories and talk about them with him take him to museums and on walks discussing the interesting things you see be enthusiastic about everything if he sees you show interest in things like reading then he will start to be more interested himself if he does work that you think could be better presented it could be that his hand eye control is still developing give him activities that practise this such as tracing doing jigsaw puzzles making models and painting ask him to talk about what he has done with you and if he is happy with his 'work' then display it somewhere so he feels his efforts have worth this will lead him to trying harder with his tasks at school also get into the habit of asking him to tell you something good that he did at school that day it could be writing painting playing nicely helping the teacher whatever give him cuddles and lots of verbal praise for this he will soon start trying to do new 'good' things to tell you all about  Social rule Extreme Programming Milton H.

i neeed help what can i have i would have to have some help lol unless i read the directions but i have trouble sometimes focusing sometimes mostly all the time i have trouble pay attetion ill listen then something gets my attention my aunt is trying to help me but my mom and dad dont do anyting bout it but my parents they dont really help as much they would just tell me im fine just try but it isnt to easy byw am year old turning in sep and am going to th grade i got in a lot of truouble in elemetry school like am always hyper my friends thinks i have adhd but idk can i have it yes you may have it and if diagnosed you can be placed on mind altering drugs that will make you into a shy little gnome that doesn't get along with too many people or you can work towards controlling it yourself i know adults who are on medication and have relied on it for all their lives it now does them little good and they have no way to cope my son is also add and has been free of medication for years he's a very outgoing and happy child who has learned to put his 'disorder' to his advantage first and foremost understand that you don't fit in a 'normal' world there are billions of people in the world and none of us are the same there is actually nothing 'normal' in this world only the perception of what people should be for instance when my son does his homework he has a tv on the ipod stuck in his ears is munching on food and quite often is also playing x box this is not normal there is no way i could possibly do that in my way of thinking it can not be done you must sit in a well lit room with no distractions and do your homework thats the normal way we would work for hours doing homework the normal way until i would finally break down and finish it for him he accepted that he was not normal long before i did when i finally accepted that it was possible for him to do all that stuff and his homework at the same time he started finishing the homework in minutes instead of hours and he did it right too so when you are trying to focus try to not focus understand that you are picking up things at a much faster rate processing them getting bored by them going onto a different subject processing it getting bored by it then going on to a different subject over and over it goes so as the teacher is talking silently recite in your head the preamble of the constitution and with your foot gently tap out the rhythm to some song that you like don't focus on any one of them go back to each in its turn you will find that you understand more of what the teacher is saying you may find that you comprehend all of it also and very importantly talk to your teachers on the first day of class or in the first week tell them that you have troubles paying attention that you are working on it and would like their help and understanding a student that does that is a lot less likely to get in trouble and a lot more likely to get help edit many 'brilliant' people are also add people have pegged them also as abnormal they are smarter then average the big difference is that they naturally have learned to control their ability to process information at a much higher rate its the same ability you have to learn but once you learn it the same advantages they have from this 'disability' will also be yours  Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Dyslexia Shaggy dog story Asperger syndrome Hearing impairment Milton H.

your kid needs something instead of taking them to the store they insist they are old enough to make a responsible purchase reluctantly you give them the money what did they need and what did they buy this can be hypothetical or a true story i once had a stepson that needed baseball shoes and an athletic cup for little lge he insisted he could make a responsible purchase he comes back home an hr later and he bought his shoes a size larger which was perfect because we hoped he would be able to wear them again next season he's yrs old but he bought a large athletic cup we said shawnee why'd you buy the large size he said that's ok i'll grow into it true story linda nowhere was i endorsing this the above incident was the only time this took place for me but i'm also saying hypothetically which opens the door for a creative humorous false answer as these things go that is a responsible decision for an year old sounds like a smart kid to me  Nike, Inc.

any military schools for yr olds my son is years old he has been diagnosed with a severe case of adhd and he is absolutely unrully he fights with his younger brother he fist fights with me he steals he lies and cannot participate in regular classroom activities he doesn't have many friends because he is mean to them the other day he wrapped a cord to mini blinds around his neck until he broke the skin i want to check him into military school or something but can't seem to find any for his age group does anybody know of any for his age roup and before people start giving me there opinion please understand i have exhausted all other efforts and forms of discipline his adhd testing lasted months of externsive testing to be sure he actually had it and it is frequently checked to make sure it was not misdiagnosed i am not looking for a bunch of rude comments on how to raise my son if people have any legitimate advise i am willing to listen but primarily looking for military schools for year olds thanks my son is very smart he is going into the th grade and has the intelligence level of a th grader he is on medication for his adhd your son sounds a lot like my nine year old son however my son has been diagnosed with aspergers syndrome which is often confused with adhd i would suggest your healthcare provider look into aspergers too i wouldn't go to the extreme of sending him away as he will feel like you are punishing him and it will make it worse and he will resent it try to make sure you avoid confrontations with him remove him from volatile situations before they get out of hand try to ignore the bad and praise him at every opportunity even for silly little things try to spend some activity time with him try jungle charts website for behaviour charts which may or may not work with your son but it's worth a go here's a bit of advise for bedtime get him in a warm bath and play with him let him splash about let him get thing wet they'll dry dry him off and have him lie down massage him with lavender moisturiser start with his neck then his shoulders then move onto his upper torso then his legs and his feet take your time he will enjoy the physical contact and the massage will calm his body while the lavender will calm his mind this always works for my son and he wakes up feeling well rested and calm i know how difficult life can be sometimes you just feel like pulling your hair out people think your a bad parent because of his behaviour and think he's a bad child when you know he's got problems i would urge you not to give up just yet i've been there myself many a time things can seem so impossible but try to remember that your son has no more control over his behaviour than you have he probably feels as impotent about it as you do he will have no idea why he behaves that way or how he can stop himself he is a lost little boy who needs a hand finding the right way to go remember that regardless of how nasty people are you are not a bad parent and your son is not a bad child good luck  Asperger syndrome Social rule Autism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Prostate cancer Urinary incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Autism rights movement Theory of conduct Massage Fecal incontinence Adult attention-deficit disorder Human sexual behavior Insomnia Breastfeeding Chronic fatigue syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Aerial (dance move) Kodocha Spanking Dog Childbirth Drowning Androgen insensitivity syndrome Professional wrestling holds Ludwig Wittgenstein Professional wrestling attacks Procrastination Infantilism Swimming Tai Chi Chuan Professional wrestling aerial techniques Controversies in autism Goodness and value theory Equine conformation Carpal tunnel syndrome Little Britain Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Diving Methylphenidate Theodore Kaczynski Professional wrestling slang Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Poker jargon Sleep Weight training Cephalic disorder Scientology beliefs and practices Pitaten Eczema Abortion debate Boxing Dog training Alcoholics Anonymous Shaggy dog story Combat stress reaction EastEnders Autism epidemic Hyperthermia Bondage (BDSM) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Piccolo Junior Saga Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders Autistic spectrum Puberty Violin Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Jam (TV series) Hey Jude Children of Dune Chlorpromazine Meat Loaf Obsessive-compulsive disorder Ron Weasley Diving suit Son Gohan Migraine Vulcan (Star Trek) Eddie Guerrero Medicine Anger management Sauna Martial art Transactional analysis StarCraft: Uprising Dragon Booster Columbine High School massacre Gundam W G-Unit: Last Outpost Characters in the Smurfs The Invisibles Swingout

whats the best way to help a twelve year old get to sleep she can't fall asleep at night even when she is really tired it has been going on for a long time now it affects her mood and schoolwork when she is trying to go to sleep she will literally be just laying down for sometimes even hours there are many things that can cause problems with sleep enviroment diet worry etc you need to find out what the problem is a specialist may be needed i suggest keeping a journal of her day when she wakes up what she does what she eats is she taking naps during the day this can cause problems sleeping at night does she have caffeine within hours of going to bed is there something bothering her too much school work problems with friends etc when does she wake in the morning it is recommended that you wake at the same time every morning regardless of it being weekday or weekend i have been an insomniac for years the most helpful thing for me were not napping waking at the same time going to bed at the same time and getting into a routine routines are very helpful as they allow the body to recognize that it is bed time for my routine i get into pajamas brush teeth read chapters in my book and go to bed i put on relaxing music which is another way to signal to your body that it is time for sleep it may take awhile to get your daughter to adjust her body to going to sleep at night if she is used to being awake at night it took me a few weeks to get myself back on track  Insomnia Urinary incontinence Daylight saving time Lucid dreaming Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Narcolepsy Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Avenue Q Apollo 8 Delayed sleep phase syndrome Polyphasic sleep Mattress 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Rule of St Benedict Siesta Caffeine Breastfeeding Out-of-body experience Blankets (graphic novel) Opportunity rover timeline for 2005 March Sleep disorder Donald Neilson The Amber Spyglass Sleep debt Spirit rover timeline for 2004 April Garfield Cat Social rule Tooth Pope John Paul I Dream Fancy rat Futurama (TV series - season 5) Characters of The Sandman Milton H.

any tips for getting kids motivated for school ok we started off the summer with great intentions reading lists summer workbooks camps educational visits to museums etc but now it has all boiled down to video games tv shows and sleeping in the morning yikes i worry that my kids are not going to be focused on their studies this year any pearls of wisdom from experienced parents or kids who have 'been there' will be greatly appreciated it sounds like you're doing the right thing naturally most kids even if they don't admit it are a bit bored by weeks of tv and video games so they will probably actually be quite excited to get back to school and start having a more varied life again i know it always made me look forward to school when a few days before my mum would take me out shopping for stationery i always liked to start a new school year with new stationery  Homeschooling SpongeBob SquarePants Little Britain EastEnders The Apprentice 3 One Tree Hill (TV series) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Fairly OddParents Education Social rule Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide About a Boy The Adventures of Pete & Pete Teachers (film) I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Girls Aloud AFI 100 Years series Shaggy dog story Graduate school Our Gang Play School Roxette Theory of conduct Animal Crossing Pok__mon (anime) WCBS-FM Infantilism MTV2 Cindy Sheehan Attack on Pearl Harbor Music Douglas Adams The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Marching band The Star Wars Holiday Special The Legend of Zelda series characters The Contender (television series) The Critic USS Yorktown (CV-10) Intelligent design movement Richard Feynman Baseball Spy Kids Daylight saving time Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Catcher in the Rye Weezer The Ashlee Simpson Show Emo Spot the Dog They Might Be Giants Sesame Street Wargaming Survivor (TV series) Summer Homecoming (tradition) The Late Show with David Letterman The Lovely Bones Video game developer Super Mario Bros. television series Kender The Young Ones (TV series) Generation Y Neopets Philosophical skepticism SMTV Live Cro Laura Schlessinger The Kids in the Hall Deftones The Den (television) Cleveland Browns Scooby-Doo Childbirth A-ha Garfield British comedy Humphrey Bogart Donald Rumsfeld Friends Hey Jude Sydney Riot of 1879 Charter school Hereditary peer Lightsaber Education in the People's Republic of China A Course In Miracles Kid Radd Dick Cavett Red Hot Chili Peppers Milton H.

parenting question should i let him keep it my eleven year old son has a bad habit of 'taking things from others without taking them' he will see something he likes and makes the person give the thing or another like it to him yugio cards toys ect he broke the breaks on his bike so has been bike less he came home a week later with a used bike belonging to a kid he met at the park fine i let him keep it but he has gone as far as telling kids he doesn't own swimming trunks so they will had over their extra pair for him finally last wednesday i explained to him that this must end and the next thing he gets from someone in that way he will have to turn over to me so yesterday i get home from work and see that he somehow got this used tackle box from somewhere the thing is bigger than my tackle box and my son's put together it is obviously old and used but still ok to use i love fishing w'him i know he will get upset and i'll feel bad getting rid of it for a while i guess but i should carry out what i say right beyond a shadow of a doubt i know he got it by begging for it in some way he has a tackle box already by the way he did not have any money to buy the thing either my question is should i take it and if i do will it send a bad message you've got to follow through on what you said even if it is old and possibly not worth much to whoever he got it from he still got it by engaging in the behavior you're trying to stop if you let him keep it you're sending the message that you're not very serious about stopping this behavior he's becoming a skilled manipulator he may get away with it with his peers but don't let him pull it on you too taking the tackle box may be a bit heartbreaking because it does represent an activity you like to do together but in the long run you're not doing him any favors if you let him get away with it  Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ocean's Twelve Avenue Q Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Kimi Finster Poker jargon Jumpstart 3rd Grade Social rule Surveillance Futurama (TV series - season 5) Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Shawn Michaels Winning Streak EastEnders Dog training Extreme Programming Knots Landing Eric Cartman American football strategy Conker's Bad Fur Day Theory of conduct One Tree Hill (TV series) Cindy Sheehan Miss Saigon Ecco the Dolphin Vernon Schillinger The Amazing Race Great Teacher Onizuka The Inside Billboard Hot 100 Dancing at Lughnasa Tag Rent (musical) Public-key cryptography Football (soccer) Hey Jude Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Procrastination Milton H.

my year old daughter has become very clingy to me i have asked her if she is being bullied at school brownies etc and also if anyone has upset her within her close friends and family and all the answers are the same which is no i ask her why she wants to be with me all the time and her reply is that she loves me she has also said that she doesn't want to go back to her out of school activities which she has always been happy to go to we had two close family friends pass away last year and it is the only thing that i can think of that is worrying her i am looking for any advice sensible only please to help her overcome this little phase that she seems to be going through i am worried that she is missing out on her childhood by clinging to my apron strings i am a protective mum but looking for a happy medium i think there could be several possibilities for your daughter's behavior the death of anyone that a child knows is traumatic death is final and most kids and adults have trouble coping depending on your religion your daughter may be unsure about what happens after someone dies i think that talking to her to explain your views or having your pastor set things straight might ease her mind adults underestimate kids' need to know and sometimes take the position that the less information the better which is not true in my experience i will discuss it for a long or often and as frank as they want i try not to sugar coat the info it only leads to confusion also were the deaths by accident long illness sudden illness discuss the cause with your daughter to try to ease her fears mary went to the doctor and the doctor said that her heart was not working right and it quit working like it should and she died your daughter may be worried about losing you to a sudden illness or accident if the other occurred were unexpected at your daughter realizes that she is suppose to be growing up and she's scared to grow up because once she's grown up she's not suppose to be a momma's girl anymore at she figures she can get by with being clingly because she's but she realizes that this won't go on forever or she'll be uncool be patient be loving be supportive don't push her to grow up maybe start treating her like she's somewhat grown up but not totally sit and read with her tuck her in a night she may be being bullied but is afraid to admit it ask the brownie leader or teacher to pay attention without being obvious and then check back my guess is that she's just scared of growing up and who could blame her good luck  Pitaten Shaggy dog story Milton H.

i'm a sigle dad looking for a book about sex ed for my year old daughter i've been told it's not too early to teach her i either need a book i can read or one we can read together to help explain what she needs to know at this age there is a great book called ''flight of the stork'' that covers the subject of sex talk from birth to age might be worth it for you to look into it my mom had this rule where if we asked about something she would answer i don't think it is ever to early but it depends on how graphic you get so at this age keep it pretty basic and if she has questions be as honest as you can without getting to detailed i applaud you for taking this time to find out rather than avoiding the question great job additional info i see a lot of people telling you to wait until she is or tell you that you must be joking and you should have her stick to barbies and girlie stuff my mother is a social worker who works with teen parents her youngest teen parent was years old the girl became sexually active when she was ten years old is too late to first start talking about the birds and the bees also when other people say that books shouldn't teach kids about sex that is incorrect books offer a good introduction to your talk if you feel like you do not know what to say a book is a good way to start the discussion you structure it just like a lesson begin with an introduction answer her questions during the reading and explain the story after the reading  Joke Social rule Theory of conduct Kodocha Sex education Human sexual behavior Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Little Britain About a Boy Survivor (novel) Child sexuality Calvin and Hobbes Kurt Cobain Avenue Q Shaggy dog story The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Married... with Children Plame affair Discordianism Transactional analysis Age of consent English grammar Sexual orientation Laura Schlessinger Titans (comics) Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Abortion debate The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Garfield Current teachings of Prem Rawat Adolescence $ale of the Century The Ashlee Simpson Show The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Futurama (TV series - season 5) Teenage pregnancy U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Infantilism Androgen insensitivity syndrome Graduate school Prostate cancer Great Teacher Onizuka Milton H.

children and walk don't walk lights i am interested in what other parents do my kids are and and have been taught by us and at school about traffic lights and walk and don't walk i was with my six year old son in cedar rapids a few weeks ago and the sign said don't walk one couldn't even see a car at all and we were slightly in a hurry so we walked across the street my son asked me why did we walk when the sign said not to and obviously i didn't have a good answer anyone else been in a similar situation i think i screwed up and should have patiently waited rather than send my son a mixed message what do you think when i was little my mum always made me and my brother wait until the lights changed but my dad would hurry us across streets if he thought it was safe my young brain told me that if daddy was there it was safe because he was a grown up and it was allowed i don't really condone that i work with kids and always make them wait but if you want to explain that to your children then they will probably understand say something like when you're a grown up you'll be able to tell when it's safe to cross a street but children must always always always wait for the 'walk' sign also explain exactly why you knew it was safe ie there were no cars at all and that you would never ever try to race across if you saw traffic coming  Shaggy dog story About a Boy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart Milton H.

help my and half year old keeps being mean to other children prof 's and parents that went through it i have a and a half year old daughter and this has been the fourth time in her life that she displayed being mean to other children the first time was when she was about and i walked in on her yelling at her cousin that is a year younger than her and i told her about it and made her appologize and she stood in the corner the second time was about weeks ago when we went away on vacation and she clawed her other cousin on his arms and legs for no reason she was punished for that also but when asked why she did it she said no reason the rd time was about days later and she shoved him to the floor when asked why she said she didnt know why by this time i was fully fed up and since i'm months pregnant her father made it to her before i did which was a good thing for her cause he sent her to the corner after yelling at her then today i went to pick up a friend of mines and her yr old and she bit the little girl finger while in the car again for no reason please help i agree with the other poster that these are seperate incidents and more than likely related to the new baby on the way however just sticking her in the corner probably isn't enough of a punsihment for her to think about her actions before she does it again all standing in a corner does to a kid really is well take a few minutes out fo their day all goes back to normal in to minutes it's time for the punsihment to fit the crime she needs to have something taken away from her something she covets either a special show on tv or a favorite toy and not just for an hour this item needs to be taken from her for several days and when she asks about it she can be reminded by you exactly why she can't have it when she does get it back it is yet another time to remind her why she is getting it bac and what will happen if she hurts someone again if she hurts someone again while the item is taken away then she loses two things etc but hopefully that won't happen on the other side of the coin though make sure you praise her for her good efforts and even moreso after the baby is born make sure you put away special time for just her where baby won't get in the way of it  About a Boy EastEnders The Inside Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Father's Day (Doctor Who) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha Shaggy dog story The Amazing Race Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Piccolo Junior Saga Columbine High School massacre One Tree Hill (TV series) Sharon Tate Theory of conduct 2000 Australian Grand Prix John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Teen Girl Squad Alois Hitler 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Professional wrestling holds Time Out of Mind The Adventures of Pete & Pete Escape from New York Breastfeeding Knots Landing The Shining (film) Neighbours Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Wheel of Fortune Xiaolin Showdown Shawn Michaels Pitaten Baby Blues Phoebe Halliwell The Price Is Right Aerial (dance move) The Family from One End Street The Catcher in the Rye Jam (TV series) Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Charmed Blonde on Blonde Ron Weasley RuneScape quests Sydney Riot of 1879 Kender Silent Night, Deadly Night Days of our Lives Blood on the Tracks Fancy Crane The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix The Apprentice 2 Sin City Babe Ruth's Called Shot Hansel und Gretel Colony in Space Good Times Romulus and Remus Boston Public Friends Vegeta Characters of Lost Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Luke and Laura Spencer Incarnations of Immortality George Costanza Russian joke The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Conspiracy (TNG episode) Professional wrestling attacks History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Hollywood Squares True Crime: Streets of LA Ben Johnson (athlete) One Life to Live Inspector Gadget Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban My Family (television) Jean Grey Mojave people Ocean's Twelve Ron and Fez Garfield She Loves You Salad Fingers Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism

at what age is it inappropriate for a boy to play with action figures my nephew who is almost still plays with action figures i find this bizarre also and i find this even more bizarre my sister makes him kiss her every time he leaves or enters the room please give me your opinions he also is never lat out of the house he needs to see the world outside of his house he gets picked on at school and doesnt have any friends my grandson is almost and still plays with action figures he's got a great imagination and builds huge sets for them etc leave him alone on that count but when you say that your sister makes him kiss her every time he leaves or enters a room that's ridiculous excessive and sick your sister has a problem letting go of her adolescent son and he's going to get some wierd complex i'll bet there is not a psychologist around who would think that behavior is normal it would be one thing if he went to her for a kiss although also a bit wierd for a yr old but for her to make him come t her for a kiss is bizarre  Friends Jam (TV series) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Milton H.

how can i help my year old stop wetting his pants my son wets his pants almost every day last year at school i had to take him clean pants at least once a week and sometimes that was after he wet his extras in his backpack at home he wears a diaper to bed my mom said that just makes it ok to pee but it's just at night he has been to the dr and has no medical problems like diabeates iv'e tried everything from rewards to taking away privilages to punishments please help lots of children wet the bed at night so this in itself isn't too much of a worry but it is rare for a year old to wet himself so often during the day time it could be a problem that the doctor hasn't picked up in which case i would start making a bit more of a fuss at the doctor's surgery and insist on more tests or a second opinion or a referral to a specialist utimately i don't think a year old would consciouly want to wet himself as other kids of this age can be quite cruel and may laugh at him for doing so so he will already be upset with himself for doing it so punishments probably won't help does he know when he needs to pee if he isn't aware of the feeling of a full bladder then there is almost definitely a medical problem try to get him into a routine of when to go to the toilet if he wets himself this regularly he really needs to go to the toilet to 'have a try' at least once every half an hour his school should be understanding of this and allow him to go to the bathroom this regularly a school i worked in used a timer for a little boy who soiled himself often when the timer went off he knew it was time to go to the bathroom perhaps there could be a quiet timer that could sit on his desk so it wouldn't draw too many people's attention to it the teachers wouldn't even need to say 'go to the toilet now' which may embarrass him he would know to just get up and go this may help to train his bladder to go at certain times of the day and eventually your son could increase the time between trips to the bathroom my friend's sisters sometimes wet themselves at school becuase they were too scared to ask to go to the toilet if he is a nervous child he may just try to hang on as long as he can so he won't have to ask but then pass the point of no return having the rule of going at certain times will ensure that he gets there in plenty of time and will also mean he won't have to ask it will just become his normal routine i wet the bed when i was little and as well as the usual no drinks before bedtime and going to the toilet just before getting into bed my mum would also wake me up when she came to bed just enough to be able to lead me to the toilet to pee and then straight back to bed this usually worked really well  Urinary incontinence Fecal incontinence Kimberly-Clark Corporation Social rule Bedwetting Milton H.

would you be angry about this too my husband and i work different shifts and we can only afford one car for now he works an hour away from home and he has to take the car to work because he doesn't get home from work until late at night anyway i have to go and pick my daughter up from school everyday and lately it has been very hot and humid here over degrees with a heat index of i am not joking my neighbor has a car and they can see our house from where they live and my neighbor's daughter goes to the same elementary school as my daughter does they have never offered us a ride when it has been so hot and humid outside for the past week and i want to know if i have every right to be angry and upset at them for just ignoring us when they know that we have to walk in the heat everyday they were my friends until now and i am not going to forget how they conveinently ignored my daughter and i when it has been so hot and humid outside and we have had to walk four blocks to the school and back home i am sorry but i could never just ignore somebody that i cared about when i knew that they didn't have a car to go and get their child from school especially when it has been so hot and humid outside it just amazes me how selfish and self centered some people have become when they won't even offer their neighbor a ride and i have even offered them money to take me back and forth and they still have some lame excuse as to why they can't do it i could never ever live with myself knowing that i could help my neigbor if i had a car and just knowing that a parent and child were suffering in this hot and humid weather would just break my heart maybe i am odd but i would offer to give my neighbors a ride if i knew that they had to walk back and forth in this heat and humidity i am sorry but i have to totally disagree with almost everyone elses answer here these neighbors were friends of yours and your child is young and this is the reason you are walking her in the first place and if it were me i would be angry not only were they your friends but they would not be going out of their way and you even offered them money for blocks my child who is has a problem with the sun and heat and she cannot be outside between the hours of and and if the humitidy is up she can't go out at all even if well hydrated i don't understand why these people are acting this way especially when a young child is involved but apparently they are very selfish i am very aware of what this world is coming to and how we are all forgetting that one act of random kindness makes this world go around it would do no harm to help out a neighbor it would do no harm to help out a child it would do no harm to drive two extra people in the same direction you are going to the same place you are going for the same place you are going i would have to say this neighbor has some reason unknown to you and i would when you have the chance i would ask her i would ask her why why did you feel the need to do this to us when we were friends even if you felt it was only blocks sure we are not in africa and we don't have to walk miles to get water and we praise god for that here in america but the question was would you be angry about the way this friend and neighbor treated you not if you lived here or there or blocks is a good walk get over it i suffer from a very rare nueromuscular disorder and i cannot even walk block do you know if the writer of this post has a problem with walking through a lot of answers i see so many put downs its unreal when asnwering someone remember these are people who are deserving of respect and dignity in your response you can be honest and you should be but you never have the right to be nasty and to be hurtful so my answer is yes i would be hurt by the actions of this former friend of yours because its hot outside and the heat effects us all differently and if it were me and my little girl we would end up in the er  Theory of conduct Social rule Milton H.

what do you do when your y o says i want to get dead it's a typical 'bad day' for my boyfriend's y o i stay at home and take care of him while his dad is at work i've gotten on to him all day for various things giving the dog his toys to chew up back talking giving smart alleck remarks etc i told him that i would give him lunch at noon at 'til noon i was about to fix his lunch when he got in trouble again for smarting off again i told him that he would have to wait at i fixed him leftover pasta salad he complained about that he loved it days ago i told him to eat it so he whined and finally said fine in rude mannor i told him that i was tired of his smart comments and that he would have to wait even longer i send him to his room and i was only going to wait a few minutes before i called him back unfortunately he started throwing things so i went in there and spanked him no comments about that because me and his dad won't listen to it continued with 'additional details' afterwards he started saying i wanna get dead over and over i've gotten i don't love you you're not my friend you're not my family plenty of times but what he's said now scares me i walked in there after standing outside his door listening a few minutes and asked him if he was ready to eat he said yes but he also said you're killing me i said what he said you made my head hurt and it's killing me he gets headaches when he gets really angry or plays rough for hours on end he's in there eating right now with no complaints the boy has been through way too much as a kid his mother isn't in the picture anymore thank god and i'm doing the best i know how i don't have any kids he also has adhd and is taking meds for that as well as bipolar disorder what on earth do i do now he already sees a therapist and a psychiatrist this is ridiculous i do spend plenty of time with him we read books play games and i tutor him he's a little behind in school however when he's bad he knows that we can't do fun things together i can't take tv away because his tv time is limited to only when he's good he gets irritated and frustrated when he watches too much tv i can't take toys away because then he has a reason to sit there and stare at the wall his favorite pasttime pretend i don't hear him i do that all day long i pretended that the dogs didn't chew up the first toys i pretended that he didn't smart off the first few times this question may be pointless flower girl i do use positive reinforcement we have a chart of 'smiley faces' he gets one every hour he knows that he will be rewarded for the smiley faces he gets he doesn't get one if he's been bad the past hour at we were supposed to play topple together i need to do research on adhd for one i'm a psychology major for two i was diagnosed adhd at wrong diagnosis however at i was diagnosed bipolar trust me i know what he's going through my parenting style is almost the same as his dads maybe i should go drop him off at his mother's house where she can ignore him and beat him with a belt when he gets on her nerves then she can send him home in soiled clothes the boy doesn't know what 'family' is he thinks his friend's are his cousins he thinks his 'mammaw' gave birth to him he thinks his ex stepmom is his real mom and his real mom is his step mom and yes me and his dad do correct him and explain the truth i give the f ck up when was the last time he was good just now he's being good in the living room i didn't get on here to talk about when he was good yesterday we watched beauty and the beast together played school and i let him help me cook wow i'm such a horrible person didn't i mention that i'm bipolar on meds and they're working great i deserved every spanking i got as a child bipolar or adhd or not i went in the living room where he was at about he was a totally different person we talked about his anger and frustration that's been going on up until now i told his if he was good until that we would do something fun together then he read me a book he's actually ahead in reading now when at the end of the school year he was a little behind too many people responded with rude comments why insult my parenting style when none of you know the whole situation i've gathered my parenting style for my mother grandmother sister and friends with kids yahoo answers is apparently not the place to go if i insulted you and your parenting style why would you listen to what i have to say maybe if people on here were a bit nicer i'd be more inclined to listen to what they have to say i won't insult you i don't even get a hint that you're a bad parent from what you've said the reason i'm answering this is because my y o says the same thing to me here's the thing my daughter was confronted with death at a very early age days before her th b day we lost her week old sister however even though she has had sthand experience with death she still doesn't understand what it means and i doubt your son does either death is a hard concept for an adult to grasp much less a little kid i think when my daughter says i wish i was dead and i wish you never borned me she's actually just expressing an intense desire to get out of whatever situation she's in at the moment occasionally she has said that she wants to be dead to see her baby sister and that is very obviously different she's not wishing herself out of something but instead missing her sister your son is trying to express a concept that is very common he's just using words that are taboo because he doesn't know how else to say it i just always say to my daughter no you don't sweetie or something like that and sometimes we talk about how death is forever and problems are not how much i say about it really depends on the situation i don't want to make a huge deal about it but i also don't want her to think that dying is an appropriate solution to a problem trust yourself you seem to be doing well with the cards you've been

why do you think years old boy beats his girl classmates in school no i think he is copieng somebody he keeps repeating though he was warned even by parents of female classmates well if you mean beats as in hitting them it's probably because he likes them if he's beating them as in pulling the hair a little or pushing just a little then that's normal most young boys don't know how to handle their feelings and show how they feel by annoying girls but if he's beating them like giving them bruises or making them bleed that's bad and needs to be stopped if he saw any movies or tv shows where husbands beat their wives he's probably copying it or maybe he overheard someone talking about abuse either way you have to make him stop first you have to find out why he's doing it ask him if he saw a show or movie or heard someone talking about it if he says yes ask him what show or movie or who then don't let him watch that show or movie anymore and if it was a person he heard it from talk to them and ask them politely to not talk about troubling things when there are young children around then you have to make him stop it everytime he hits someone in school take away one toy tell him why too say well i heard you hit girl's name today and that's bad you can't hit people i'm going to take his favorite toy away for a week if you don't hit anyone in a week you can have it back if you hit someone else i'll take another toy and go through with it if that doesn't work sit him down and give him a good talk tell him that he cannot hit people it is mean and no one will want to be his friend if he does be very serious so he knows you're not kidding then if he keeps hitting people talk to him again and no tv for a three days if he continues bump it up to a week if he still continues no tv and no computer for a week if he still continues talk to his teacher and ask if s he has any suggestions if nothing works take him to a children's therapist or psycologist he has to learn that what he's doing is wrong good luck i hope i could help  Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha Avenue Q Milton H.

my sons friends are'nt being looked after properly my son is and plays with particular friends they come from different families but neither of them have any parents at home who cook a meal for them or provide drinks or lunch during the day one child has no mum and his dad is out most of the time and relies on his year old sister to cook i am feeding these kids good home cooked food for dinner most night as they seem to exist on rubbish at home i dont mind doing it sometimes but its becoming a habit and getting rather expensive i cant approach the parents as one dad is an alchoholic and a bully and the other just isnt there i am more concerned with the children not getting a good meal than the money aspect but it cant go on forever i feel responsible although i know i shouldnt any ideas please well done to you and i am sure these boys think highly of you for the care you give them i would also be concerned with the 'love' aspect too all kids need a hug and if these parents are so distant not to be able to provide the basic food and water then they are highly unlikely to show them a great deal of care or love it may be worth mentioning to social services if you feel unable to approach the parents directly also give the boys a hug i am sure they both need one still i take my hat off to you you're obviously a brilliant mum with attention to detail you children are going to grow into well adjusted adults because of the care and time you put into them  About a Boy Food Hikikomori Infantilism The Fairly OddParents Care Bears Fecal incontinence Meal Motivation Pitaten EastEnders Laura Schlessinger Parenting The Adventures of Pete & Pete Comanche Social rule The Brady Bunch Hypoglycemia Only Fools and Horses Little Britain Second language acquisition Breastfeeding Child sexuality Recurring South Park characters Friends W.I.T.C.H.

year old son is overly sensntive how should this be dealt with i raised my son from ages yrs old as a single mom his dad was not a big part of his life for reasons that i won't get in to here i was remarried a year ago so his stepfather is really the only father figure he has but as with most boys who were minus a male figure for many crucial developemental years he's very sensitive and has his feelings hurt a lot by his friends his friends are just being typical boys and acting the way most boys his age do but my son is not a typical boy and quite frankly has been through more hurt than any year old should face he's very emotional and sensitive and his feelings get hurt quite easily and other boys don't understand that through no fault of their own he's been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and sees a therapist once a week it's helping but i was also curious about the thoughts of other parents as well which is why i'm asking here short of telling him stop being a baby and toughen up what should i do i think that the best way is to talk to him when he is upset about the situation at hand you need to rationalize with him how serious the incident was for example if someone calls him a name obviously he's upset so don't just fluff it off recognize that his feelings were hurt but help him to understand that its only words and that its not worth getting upset over you need to go through each incident some can be downplayed and some will be more serious do this gradually and be consistant  About a Boy Transsexuality Domestic violence Shaggy dog story The Ashlee Simpson Show Transactional analysis Theory of conduct Kodocha Clinical depression Obsessive-compulsive disorder Androgen insensitivity syndrome Fathers' rights Narcissism Traumatic incident reduction Autism South Park Milton H.

is it out of line to want to see my son stepson off to his first day of kindergarten some events in our family are parents only and i understand this for example doctor appointments unless otherwise agreed upon are parents only and parent teacher conferences are too but would i be out of line in wanting to see my stepson off to his first day of kindergarten i am torn between two things i don't want it to be a big fuss because i would like to be there because these parents only events are mostly just to appease their mother but at the same time i don't want him to think that i didn't care enough to go i was thinking about maybe just calling at the end of his day to see how it went etc would that be better opinions suggestions i know that i am a parent whether it be biological or not but is it worth having to possibly deal with an upset biological mother i don't want him to think that i don't care enough to go but i also don't want to cause problems that would possible effect his day i personally think that it would be out of line to keep you away from this event i'm sure your son will be so excited to have all his parents biological and step there supporting him on his first day of school i'm sorry if this doesn't make his biological mother happy but perhaps if you explain to her that the boy you both share is so special that you love him too either way she's going ot have to just lump it she can't tell people to not love the little boy and like it or not you are a big part of his life if you end up having to stay away which i think would be a tragedy i would suggest going out and buying your son a little happy first day gift and explain to him that his mommy and daddy want that day just to themselves but you were there with him in spirit and finally just a thought if you have the time get involved in his school meet his teacher help out at bake sales and such your son's teachers will probably be just as interested in getting to know you as you will they as you are a big part of his life it's important that they know that he doesn't just have a mom and a dad but a step mom who loves him dearly  Kodocha Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) The Fairly OddParents The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Fathers' rights Miss Saigon About a Boy Knots Landing Friends Rent (musical) Theory of conduct Cindy Sheehan Humphrey Bogart Pitaten Avenue Q The Catcher in the Rye Calvin and Hobbes Kindergarten EastEnders Intelligence quotient Doug Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Social rule Hey Arnold!

is to young to let my daughter shave she is constanly asking me to let her shave her legs part of me wants to let her because her legs are quite hairy and the hair is pretty dark but on the other hand i think is a little to young what to you guys think everyone develops differently if your daughter's legs are hairy with dark hair and she is self concious because its noticeable let her shave show her what she needs to do and help her as much as you can age is just a number when it comes to the development of a young girl's body also at that age she may be taking gym in school and having to change in front of other girls and the ridule she can receive because of not being allowed to shave is so much worse than we really want to admit its hard wanting to let your baby girl grow up but truth is it happens just sooner for some than others  Kodocha Hair Tarantula Pubic hair Beard Social role of hair Puberty Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Leg shaving Shaving Skinhead Haircut Tenchi Muyo!

can a person learn patience i have a yr old with adhd and for those of you wanting to judge me on this i am not labeling my daughter it is a disease anyways what are some ways to learn patience i have a low patience and tolerance and although i have a child with this disease i am finding it really hard to find the patience with her any suggestions i have a friend who has a child that has been labeled since he was years old when he started school it seems to me that a child is not allowed to carry on like he should everyone has a temper everyone gets mad when we don't get what we want everyone gets mad and upset when we are called names hit punched or something is taken away from us that we were enjoying it at the time think about it a lot of grownups do all these things and yet a child is told he has adhd he is full of energy get a book or go to your library and ask the librarian if they cary a book titled how to speak to your child so they will listen i don't have it in front of me i believe it is close to that tiltle but it is a book worth reading and re reading it it will tell you to re word your sentences so that your child will start hearing you talking the commands demands shouting that we do to our children they are learning to block you off come here get over here i told you you just wait i'm going to don't do that no i said no i want you then when you dish out punishment you don't follow through you say you are going to do something and don't do it they are being tought that you can't keep your word now it is time to really walk all over you so i hope you get the book it re directs you to i would like for you to pick up your toys in about min i'll be back in min so that we will clean up let me help you lets pick up your clothes off the floor and put it in the laundry basket suzy why don't we go and start the bath water for your bath we we we us us us lets not you or i keep up to your word of what you will plan on the punishment time out for one min of each year of how old the child is don't forget them while they are on time out and then get them and say now lets go to the room and i'll help you with the clean up or lets go pick up the clothes and lets put them where they belong it will not happen overnight but it will happen that they will listen to you and if you are calm they will feel it and they will love you also and of course tell them the good things they do big or small things compliment them on how good of a job they did at the doctors office of playing quietly how good of a job they did by picking up their shoes and putting them away you will have to learn to see all the little things they do do and say something nice about it to them and give lots of hugs and loving words you start while they are young and you will have great kids my little guy that i had at years old at the day care he is now no one would believe he was the way he was by seeing him now he is loving listens good temper he talks things out he and all kids need respect just like i told another person think how you would feel if someone talked to you the way you speak to your child come here go get out of here i don't want to see your face you are so sloppy why don't you ever listen shut up be quiet don't make me come there and hit you how does that sound to you if someone spoke to you that way kids are humans and need just as much respect as you want respect children taught me to have patience they are very innocent they need a lot of loving lots of hugs and kisses they taught me that it was not easy for me to give hugs and kisses until i had my own child and then i met hundred of other children now i have plenty of patience and love to give to anyone please look for the book schools are full of old and young people that do not respect children i will not say what type of people it is being said because of all the children that have gone through with the pulling and tugging and being sent to the office too many times instead of dealing with the child in a respectful way from kindergarden to high school this problem is there there are only a few very few people that the students respect by the way my little guy is not on meds any longer he acted like he had no mind while he was on it what a shame to put a loving child on such a terrible medication  Social rule Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pitaten Little Britain About a Boy The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Dog training Friends Japanese tea ceremony Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Milton H.

when should i tell my year old the truth about santa claus i thought about this subject often i ended up thinking it through and decided that when my kids ask me if there really is a santa claus i'm going to say yes because there is he may not be a little fat guy that comes down your chimney and leaves presents under the tree but he is definitely real he lives as the spirit of giving and every parent that creates a special christmas for their children or anyone else they love is inhabited by the spirit of santa claus therefore they are santa claus therefore he is real my daughter is but when she hears about santa being a fake here's my plan i'm going to show her the story of santa claus by finding books or information online and explain to her the spirit of santa claus i will tell her that somebody she loves and who loves her very much is being just like santa claus and making a special christmas and when she is old enough to ask about it she will also be old enough to be a santa claus so every christmas after she learns the truth she will get to do a project to create a special christmas for someone she loves so she can feel how wonderful it is to be santa claus  Santa Claus Christmas Silent Night, Deadly Night The Nightmare Before Christmas Avenue Q Rent (musical) Saint Nicholas About a Boy A Very Special Family Guy Freakin' Christmas Christmas tradition Santa Claus: The Movie Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (television special) Rankin/Bass The McGuire Sisters Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban E.

teacher seeking parent's opinions i work in a great school where the majority of the kids come from low socioeconomic families and the parents do not have a higher education beyond high school most of the teachers i know complain about it i don't i love talking to parents and working with them to show them how to help their child i would like some feedback from parents of elementary school kids or just parents regarding the importance of the teacher's role in parental involvement in other words can you give me some friendly suggestions on what you would like to see a teacher doing for your child or for you to help your child succeed thank you while i have had some college education i still have a difficult time understanding some of the things the teachers try to tell me regarding my sons' homework not because i'm stupid but because it's been a long time since i was in school and had to worry about it and things have gotten a bit more difficult since then what i would like for my sons' teachers to know is that while i am not stupid and can help my sons' with their homework i am also a working mother and up until recently a single working mother who tends to spend more time at work than she does at home with her awake children so it really helps me out a lot when the teacher allows time in class to get actual homework assignments done instead of going over the basics then assigning homework to take home i can also say that while i can help my kids with their homework there are times where even i don't understand the questions if i send them back to school with their homework incomplete it means that i helped them with as much as i could figure out and i need your help for them to finish it because i can't explain it to them well enough because even i don't understand it  Homework Education in the People's Republic of China Education Theory of conduct Saved by the Bell Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Extreme Programming Kodocha GED Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Calvin and Hobbes Recurring South Park characters Laura Schlessinger No Child Left Behind Act Education in Romania Education in Taiwan Shaggy dog story Androgen insensitivity syndrome Gifted Ludwig Wittgenstein Education in India Teach the Controversy Education in the United States Education in Japan Intelligence quotient African American Vernacular English Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Primary education Education in Germany Kender About a Boy Social rule Generation Y Charter school Intelligent design movement Philosophy of language The Fairly OddParents Humphrey Bogart Asperger syndrome Homeschooling Current teachings of Prem Rawat Education in South Korea Brown v.

daughter and school clothes i went back to school shopping yesterday with my yr old daughter and she went into the limited too store for the first time and loved it i bought her a shirt for i can't believe i paid that much for one shirt but she really wanted it bad what other mothers have gone this this and just bought it even though it was crazy expensive hello to tell you the truth i buy my daughter's clothes from wal mart or goodwill because she grows so fast and i am not ashamed to admit that is where i get her clothes from alot of people may laugh or snicker but there is nothing wrong with shopping at wal mart especially for children and do you know that i got all of her back to school clothes including socks underwear and sneakers for my daughter is tall and skinny and alot of times she is in between sizes so it is very difficult to shop for her because she grows so fast that is why i have to go to wal mart or our local goodwill store because their clothes are so much cheaper than anywhere else call me a snob or tight with my money but i think it is ridiculous to spend so much money on children's clothing that they will only be able to wear for a year if that i don't mind buying her a special pair of shoes that give her good foot and ankle support or a really special outfit for once in a while but she is told that it is a gift and not to expect getting whatever she wants all of the time because we have a very tight budget that we have to stick to i am raising her to appreciate the things that are given to her and there is more to a person than just by the brand of clothes or shoes that they wear  Social aspects of clothing Sears Holdings Corporation Wal-Mart Shoe Undergarment Clothing Married... with Children Doug Irish dance Tesco Trailer Park Boys Sock Marilyn Monroe Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an About a Boy Sweatshop Professional wrestling slang Treehouse of Horror XV Poker jargon Aerial (dance move) Animal Crossing Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) Destiny's Child Customs and etiquette of Japan Aldi Humphrey Bogart Grunge music Hazing Sento Suit (clothes) Garfield Kilt Target Corporation Phoebe Buffay's songs Eid ul-Fitr High-heeled shoe Abercrombie & Fitch Co.

my friend told me my yr daughter was talking with her yr old daughter about sex my yr old daughter already has her period and we have had the whole conversations of where babies come from and what is sex my friend was very upset as she believes her yr old is too young to hear this conversations which i can understand but she told me that from now on she needs to monitor her daughter more around my daughter this made feel upset as i don't know if her daughter ask my daughter about it please i need advise i was so choked that i didn't give her any feed back my only comment was that my daughter is and has her period and that i have talked to her about sex and where babies came from i had a conversation w my daughter last and she stated that the yr kept asking her where do babies come from she felt that she had to give her an asnwer so she told her that when a mommy and daddy have s e x she spelled it out are in love they have babies and then she said but the mommy carries the baby my daughter said they come out of the mommy's vagina most of the conversation was about having babies not about sex like her mom thought my daughter is and i talked to her about puberty etc and my shy quiet girl went to school the next day and told all her friends but these are her friends and they're also the same age but i would think that if the six year old and your year old daughter are friends then this probably came up within their normal conversation i can't imagine a year old running around and saying psst kid wanna know something and at six years old she probably heard something somewhere and could have asked it's all over tv have a happy period and certainly she could have heard about periods somewhere and was looking for an answer perhaps the six year old approached her mother already but the mother blew her off not wanting to discuss this topic so the girl goes to someone else looking for an answer to her question i've included the link to the book that i gave my daughter to read it's an awesome book written for year olds perhaps recommend this book to the mom of the year old if the year old is curious then it's time to educate her that way she doesn't need to learn from peers or worse the street  Kodocha The Catcher in the Rye The Ashlee Simpson Show Shaggy dog story God Emperor of Dune Social rule Humphrey Bogart Avenue Q EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Plame affair Child sexuality True Crime: Streets of LA Friends Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Cliff Richard Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jon Secada Milton H.
