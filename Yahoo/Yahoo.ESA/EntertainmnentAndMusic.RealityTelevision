bb uk so amy has gone another big character bites the dust why do the public do this well you know i have no faith in the british public and think that the guy that said that its mainly jealous and insecure girls is right lets face it if men voted anywhere near as much as women she'd probably still be in but i also agree with liya a really big character like charley would have confronted carole if she said those kind of things about her and for not having the guts or brains the size of her boobs to she deserved what she got in the end as i have been saying i think for entertainments sake that evicting should be taken out of the public's hands as in us the public gets too wound up and consumed with hatred and just jumps on the lastest bandwagon and just ruins the show dr bad and it is just a show  Big Brother (USA TV series) Sin City Friends EastEnders Toilet humour Bad Wolf Guilty Gear Paranoia Agent Humphrey Bogart Stewie Griffin Bandwagon effect Recurring South Park characters Breast Futurama (TV series - season 3) Static Shock Solar Element Saga Philip J.

question for people who had bb live feeds in the past seasons were the house guests in the big brother house on other seasons as awful as the house guests this year has there ever been as much fighting between the house guests as there is now this is the first year i've had access to any live shows and the way cbs edits the show is very misleading as a matter of fact this is nothing new there is always animosity at theis point one of the reasons they did not tell kail about eric was the possibility that they may need to put her back in the house this week if tensions get to violence or as dick and daniele have threatened one of them quits james threatened to quit at this point in a season and they learned from the experience if it ends in a tie either no one wins or more judges are needed and people will stop watching the show the problem is america's player the concept builds anger and distrust and eventually america turns on the player and the player turns on america eric has been told to turn on dustin and he will no doubt turn on america choosing to fail the task as is cbs lies to america making it look like eric gets his vote on thursday when he knows about it on wednesday at midnight after the votes are in from tuesday they also tell the players through diary questions who to vote for that is why eric is still in the house but look at what eric does and they have talked in house about it he gets people to fight with one another by doing things and blaming them on other houseguests who in turn get in fights with the people he was speaking with sure dick is pistol but people would not be as agitated by him if they were not looking for the snitch the back stabber and the vandal all of who were eric he is th snake in the cartoons slithering up to the king to get him to attack someone last night he threatened to dig a hole and bury dick and daniele alive he told people to make sure daniele ended up on slop from now on he told jessica to turn on her alliance he has told everyone to do that sure those are things that happen in the game but now they are being orchestrated by cbs and the reality is gone from the show  Big Brother (USA TV series) Knots Landing Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Saturday Night Live Big Brother UK series 6 Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ty Cobb Wheel of Fortune Survivor (TV series) The Joker's Wild Sin City The Amazing Race The Ashlee Simpson Show Major League Baseball television contracts Shawn Michaels American Idol RuneScape quests Survivor: Palau Cindy Sheehan Theory of conduct Alex Ferguson Whose Line Is It Anyway?

has pov ceremony been held yet did dick take himself off the block if not is it possible that he will take daniele off instead knowing that if he uses the pov on himself that daniele will most likely get voted out i guess i would only expect that of a father personally sacrafice himself for his daughter instead of getting out of the way of the firing squad and letting her take it i know he won it i was asking if he used it spoiler alert for those who don't watch feeds and don't want to know before the episode airs dick won the pov and then proceeded to pilfer through the houseguests drawers and report back to danielle with what he found namely in dustin's personally i think he won so that when it's up to him whether or not to use it he gives it to her so he can look like a hero to her so she'll let him back into her life when they're both out of the house and the show is over it would probably also speak to the mothers in the house a selfless act for a child however the ceremony has not happened yet so that's just a guess on my part everyone seems to think the ceremony will be tomorrow  Big Brother (USA TV series) House Stark Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Three Stooges Pyramid (game show) Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Haven (TNG episode) Ken Jennings Plame affair Spanish verbs Springfield Elementary School The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Knots Landing Megan Griffin Search for Tomorrow StarCraft Episode VI Dustin Hoffman The Mary Tyler Moore Show The Shining (film) Wheel of Fortune Day of the Daleks Shaggy dog story Dick Cavett Phoebe Buffay's songs Friends Whose Line Is It Anyway?

bb us america's player aside does bb interfere too much as they do here in the uk with the editing favorably or unfavourably of contestants using contestants for ratings then hanging them out to dry and trying to ensure that the person that they want to win does with the editing media coverage etc thats what happens here in the uk but your show seems a bit more clever as the public seem to have no say in the eviction process but bear in mind that i can't watch and am only going by what i've read on the websites yep it really does appear that the bb folks strongly influence what goes on in the house for example before last week's eviction they strongly encouraged the houseguests to keep eric and not evict him and then a couple of nights ago they told eveldick that they wanted to see more 'evel' out of him so the next morning he literally turns that whole house upside down this is making for a very unpleasant season imo this group of houseguests is the worse yet imo there isn't a likeable one in the group at all  Big Brother (USA TV series) Big Brother UK series 6 Big Brother (TV series) Big Brother (Australian TV series) Big Brother UK series 5 Fame Academy Pinoy Big Brother Eddie Guerrero Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Bad Wolf Big Brother (UK TV series) Milton H.
