which among the asian cooking is more healthy and which is more likely to be unhealthy why i am choosing between asian restaurants ie chinese filipino vietnamese thai and indian it's hard to say because it really depends on what ingredients are used to cook these dishes you could go in one restaurant and order a healthy looking vegetable dish but the oil could be from lard which isn't the best choice to use when cooking although it enhances flavors on the other hand you can order a completely greasy dish which is cooked with olive oil and it'll be much more healthier than the one cooked with lard to point out a certain cuisine and categorize it as being healthier than the other would be unfair to say and also unfair to give it an overall genralization just by basing it on some unhealthy dishes that someone has seen if someone already pre established their preference of cuisine just based on the few dishes that are unhealthy even before experiencing it then they're going to be missing out on a lot of great dishes the best advice to give to you is to visit these restaurants try these food out and make it your own judgement call on what you feel is healthy or not  French cuisine Chinese cuisine Cuisine of Laos Soup Cuisine of Malaysia Curry Korean cuisine Vegetarian cuisine Japanese cuisine Tofu Cuisine of Africa American Chinese cuisine Cantonese cuisine Cuisine of Brazil Cuisine of the Philippines Ramen Fish and chips Cuisine of Thailand Pizza Recipe Canadian Chinese cuisine Breakfast Chili con carne Sauce Peruvian cuisine Kashrut Bengali cuisine Hamburger Fast food German cuisine Chinatown Taiwanese cuisine Soul food Cajun cuisine Cuisine French fries Salad British cuisine Restaurant Cuisine of Singapore Coriander Mexican cuisine Cuisine of Vietnam Hot pot Cuisine of the Southern United States Stir frying Glutinous rice Polish cuisine Gumbo Cooking Rice Cuisine of Denmark Cuisine of Ethiopia Cuisine of Finland Chiuchow cuisine Jewish cuisine Chile pepper Pancake Bread Veganism Dumpling Iron Chef America Barbecue Mayonnaise Szechuan cuisine Cuisine of Cambodia Caribbean Chinese cuisine Risotto Steaming Saimin Hamster Sushi Ginger Cuisine of Greece Pasta Hakka cuisine Cheese Yum cha McDonald's Miso Chopsticks Food Common bean Atkins Nutritional Approach Idli Biscuit Little Saigon

what exactly is halal meat and is it better for you there is also kosher meat is this the same as halal can you guys please explain exactly what these ways or rituals are that's what i want to know as other users mentioned it is specific types of meat that is slaughtered to remove as much blood as possile but also with as little trauma to the animal as possible the types of halal meats exclude pork blood carcasses of animals that are already dead and carnivorous animals we're also not supposed to choose animals that are sick diseased or injured as you can probably guess this could lead to infection and diseases for the consumer most slaughterhouses in the us ignore this little bit and often cut off a cancerous sore to send to pet food manufacturers but use the rest of the sick animal for our grocery stores so in this sense halal or kosher is much better for you as far as the slaughtering method goes we are instructed to use the sharpest utensils so it will be the least painful to the animal we have to lead them away from other animals so they do not witness it and become fearful it should be done slow enough to allow the blood to drain but quick enough to end any suffering on the animal's behalf before the slaughter someone says in the name of god before proceeding only the caroid arteries and juggular veins should be cut and the spine and trachea left in tact it's still not pretty but of all the slaughtering methods i've heard of it's the most gentle on the animal also feed is also an important part as i said carnivorous animals are forbidden and making herbivorous animals into carnivorous or canniballistic ones feeding ground beef to cows the reason mad cow disease began is not permissible at any level since the animal is getting a healthier and more natural diet you can bet it's better for you just as organic fed and free range meats are a little off topic but i just saw on t v today that the yolks of two eggs from free range organic fed chickens contains more omega fatty acids than yolks from the average grocery store eggs anyways i hope this helps you and here's a little link if you want to read more about it http www azhar jp info halal eng halal html  Slaughterhouse Kosher foods Livestock Taboo food and drink Beef Unclean animals Chicken Veganism Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Meat Nutrition Omega-3 fatty acid Dog Cat Egg (food) Vegetarianism and religion Escherichia coli O157:H7 Salmon Cheese Sharia Domestic rabbit Food Shark Breastfeeding Jewish cuisine Stomach cancer Carnivore Blood Hypoglycemia Spider Factory farming First aid Insulin Pork Tooth Horse meat Prostate cancer Gray Wolf Ferret Aztec Foodborne illness Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Trans fat Tasmanian Devil Tyrannosaurus rex Traumatic brain injury Cancer Cattle Gelatin Brain Animal rights Ecology Fancy rat Atherosclerosis Kidney Mosquito Coronary heart disease Snake Tofu Trichinosis Hedgehog Orca Vegetarian nutrition Blood pressure Domesticated turkey Anemia People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Genetically modified food Pet skunk Chronic fatigue syndrome Liver Organic food Cardiovascular disease Decompression sickness Acne Tiger Shechita Cirrhosis Cantonese cuisine Tocopherol Barbecue Eucharist Shrimp farm

how do you carry a bento i know what a bento is and i have heard people say they they take theirs to work with them for lunch but how food is normally in one or multiple fairly small containers so how do you carry them all together and without sloshing all the food around if you don't know what a bento is that's fine but please don't answer no that's not at all what i was talking about and i don't have time to answer people's questions when i'm simply trying to get an answer besides why would i tell people what something is when they obviously wouldn't know my answer so it would be pointless don't be an ignorant asshole the containers usually designed with separated chambers the lid can be closed tightly and the bento food usually not the kind of soupy watery food so it won't slosh mess around easily or if you want to carry soup anyway you can put it in a separated container with the secure cap to carry home made bento wrapped the box with handkerchief or just put in in a plastic bag bento foods from the store are using disposable container and simply carried with plastic paper bag just like the ordinary take out foods http static flickr com c fb jpg http images google co jp images q e bc e bd ie utf oe utf rls org mozilla en us official client firefox a um sa n tab wi http www cookingcute com bento boxes and accessories htm  Bento Mozilla Firefox HTTP cookie Mozilla Application Suite Plastic bag HyperText Transfer Protocol Domain Name System USB flash drive Mozilla Thunderbird Hamster Ajax (programming) Plastic Japanese tea ceremony Professional wrestling match types Gmail Tea Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Web page Common Unix Printing System Web browser User agent Milk Scalable Vector Graphics Phishing Menstrual cup Sega Saturn Carburetor Xbox 360 Cascading Style Sheets Vacuum cleaner Textile manufacturing XML DVD 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Mouse (computing) Baby bottle Berimbau Customs and etiquette of Japan Internal ballistics Jabber Little Britain Stopping e-mail abuse Wine making Uniform Resource Locator MSN Messenger Agar plate Economy of Colombia Tofu Firearm Internet Relay Chat Japanese toilet Surveillance XUL Top-bar hive Password Seismic retrofit Netscape Web server Columbine High School massacre Cartridge (firearms) HTML Butterfly Gramophone record Downing Street memo Christmas tree Cremation Opera (web browser) Autopsy Coffee Entropy Drill bit Bridge Stereoscopy Printed circuit board Theory of conduct The nature of God in Western theology Freenet Phonograph cylinder Cross site scripting Poker jargon Intelligent design Transport Layer Security Medical prescription Bong Plame affair Harmonica Representational State Transfer Abstraction (computer science) Java programming language Violin ITunes The Pet Sounds Sessions Unicode Cannabis cultivation Shaggy dog story 21 July 2005 London bombings Transmission Control Protocol Ammunition Floppy disk

does anyone have a recipe for garlic dip i am looking for the recipe of the garlic dip you get at middle eastern restaurants garlic dip lrg garlic cloves tsp sea salt x egg yolk optional juice of lemon or to taste tbl extra virgin olive oil tbl strained yogurt keys accompaniment condiments dips spreads lebanese lebanon middle eastern method peel the garlic and chop it in small pieces before putting it in a mortar add the salt and pound the garlic with a pestle until you have smooth paste whisk the egg in a mixing bow and add the garlic paste stir in the lemon juice then slowly whisk in the olive oil to achieve a creamy aioli if the dip is not thick enough add more olive oil and if you find the taste too strong add a table spoon or more strained yogurt it would be easier to prepare this dip in the blender or food processor but you will need a larger quantity of garlic for the size of the blender's bowl double or triple the quantities but keep to egg yolk if you are using it comments this is an essential accompaniment to grilled chicken or quail it is particularly tasty except that it will turn you into a social leper for a good hours after you eat it still garlic is reputed to be very health and as long as you share this dip with the people you will spend time with afterwards you don't need to worry the traditional garlic dip is made with only garlic lemon juice and olive oil but it does not rise as well as when you add an egg yolk so you have the choice to make a proper aioli with an egg yolk  Japanese cuisine Jewish cuisine Breakfast Cantonese cuisine Tofu Cuisine of the Philippines Cuisine of Denmark Chili con carne Barbecue Yoghurt Cuisine of Greece Cuisine of Thailand Cuisine of Malaysia Bengali cuisine French fries Ketchup Satay German cuisine Sushi Peruvian cuisine Hummus Dim sum Egg (food) Cuisine of Laos Curry Idli Recipe Cuisine of Turkey Tea Garlic Chicken soup Hamburger Rice pudding Pizza Kelantan Rum Olive oil Coffee D__ner kebab Bread McDonald's Salad Omega-3 fatty acid Fish and chips Cheese Bearnaise sauce Hot dog Kosher foods Hot pot Chicken Risotto Mango Martini cocktail Tempera French cuisine Roe Soup Cuisine of Singapore Ramen Cider Culture of Turkey Guacamole Cha chaan teng Caesar salad Polish cuisine Laksa B__chamel sauce British cuisine Shark Pottery Cajun cuisine Pea soup Peanut butter Jiaozi Tamale Tobacco Food Mooncake Sandwich Cuisine of Africa Poker jargon Bagel Fondue Kebab Cuisine of Vietnam Kraft Dinner Baba ganoush Salmon Chutney Roman eating and drinking

can someone give me an authentic italian recipe italian cooks i know i can do online research but i am looking for something very authentic maybe the kind that only someone living in italy or that has a lot of experience with italian cooking would know thanks so much mia nona came from italy sicily precisely this is one big tradition there sicilian grilled meatballs or polpettine alla griglia one usually thinks of meatballs going into a sauce of some kind or being fried to golden perfection however sicilians also grill them and very fine eating it is too pounds k boned veal or pork ground ounces g pecorino siciliano if possible the variety with pepper corns in it if not a mild romano freshly gra cup bread crumbs moistened in milk and then squeezed dry eggs tablespoons minced parsley clove garlic minced salt pepper organically grown lemon or orange leaves lightly oiled wooden toothpicks combine all the ingredients except the leaves in a bowl and mix well roll the meat mixture into balls a little smaller than a ping pong ball flatten them slightly wrap a leaf around each and hold the leaf in place by sticking it with a toothpick when you have finished making your meatballs grill them to taste and my favorite dessert ricotta crostata ricotta pie pastry ingredients grams butter grams icing sugar grams flour grated rind of one lemon method leave butter out to soften overnight in winter or a few hours in summer so it can be worked easily into the flour put flour onto board and grate the rind into the flour mix the flour icing sugar grate in rind and then work in the softened butter the dough will be very short and crumbly you do not get a smooth fine dough it is a biscuit texture which is then sprinkled into the pan and pressed down and around the sides use spring form pan cm well greased press well into the pan and take it half way up make sure the sides and the base of the pan are well covered so there is no leakage do not pre cook the pastry filling ingredients kg ricotta icing sugar eggs seperated sugar milk grams candied fruit diced mixed fig apricot citrus mandarin orange grams toasted almonds chopped method make pastry cream as per strudel method combine ricotta with icing sugar pastry cream candied fruit candita almonds some people also add a yolk but the pastry cream in enough beat egg whites stiffly in a bowl which has first been wiped with a tiny bit of lemon juice and then dried this stops the white seperating and helps make them stiff when stiff fold through the ricotta mixture if your eggs are big you may find that you don t need to use all the egg white set oven at degree c spoon ricotta mixture into crostada and gently spread out don't put up too high keep within the pastry this can be done in a tart form but then the taste is different in the high pan it's more filling to crust which is the way the pie should be  Risotto Pasta Cuisine of Africa Soup Tortilla Russian cuisine Dairy American Chinese cuisine Cuisine of Austria Mince pie B__chamel sauce Food Ricotta cheese Cooking weights and measures Custard Vegetarian cuisine French toast Baklava Street food MRE Halva Cuisine of Greece French fries In-N-Out Burger Muesli Plastic Pottery Haggis Mooncake Confectionery Potato Cha chaan teng Kit Kat Cuisine of Canada Chicken soup Milk Doughnut

what exactly is sabje hi i'm american and i'm going to marry an indian man i love cooking and i'm learning a lot however i find some things confusing grin when i am there in india i hear that word sabje a lot my fiance says he wants to eat sabje and a couple times we made some veggies and he called it that but it was different each time i tried to ask him about it but i guess it's no surprise that he's not that familiar with cooking terms to explain things to me also right now i can't talk to him online so it's hard to get answers so i thought i'd ask you all so are there different kinds of sabje how do you make it is it just cut up veggies cooked in oil with jeera and then masala and tumeric is it any veggie or only certain ones do you use it to stuff paranthas too i'm really clueless i know ha ha thanks for your help first congratulations what an exciting time for you it's so nice that you are trying to cook indian food for your fiancee i am sure he really appreciates all your hard work efforts it's spelled sabji or subji pronounced sub jee also know as bhaji in some parts of india it's usually a vegetable based stir fried type of side dish it may or may not have gravy they are eaten with indian chapathis or rotis naans phulkas or rice different subjis have different recipes cooking methods techniques and spices masalas are different they should have their own unique taste you dont want to eat sabjis that all taste the same there are tons of different sabjis veg or paneer dishes parathas are stuffed with vegetables that are mildly spiced as fillings but they not proper subjis parathas are stuffed flatbreads traditionally eaten with yogurt and indian pickles this is an informative helpful website it will provide you with lots of recipes http www bellaonline com site indianfood examples they are all sabjis but with very different ingredients kadai paneer wok fried paneer with vegetables ingredients ounces of paneer cubed and pan fried large garlic cloves finely chopped inch piece of ginger peeled and finely minced small green thai bird chilies cut lengthwise in half large onion thinly sliced large white button mushrooms halved medium bell pepper red or green diced roma tomatoes chopped tbsp turmeric tbsp garam masala tbsp ground cumin tsp red chili powder cup roasted unsalted cashews salt to taste tbsp oil vegetable or canola juice of a lime freshly chopped cilantro leaves for garnish method in a wok or large skillet on medium high heat add the oil and the onions stir until slightly browned and add the green chilies ginger and garlic stir and add the turmeric garam masala ground cumin red chili powder and salt stir for an additional minutes and add the vegetables stir for minutes reduce the heat to low and add the cashews and fried paneer cubes garnish with freshly squeezed lime juice and chopped cilantro leaves serve with fragrant basmati rice and hot chapathis or rotis variations feel free to add your favorite combination of vegetables such as carrots peas baby corn zucchini spicy brussel sprouts brussel sprouts are a truly underrated and underused vegetable they are not even indian but my spicy version will definitely make brussel sprouts a favorite in your house just as it is in mine it s a unique dish where new world vegetable meets old world spices i hope you will enjoy it spicy brussel sprouts yield servings ingredients lb of brussel sprouts around or so medium onion finely chopped cloves of garlic finely minced piece of ginger peeled and finely minced cups of corn kernels frozen is fine tsp black mustard seeds tsp cumin seeds dried red chilies fresh curry leaves tsp turmeric juice of a lime tbsp oil vegetable or canola salt and pepper to taste cups of water for boiling cup freshly chopped cilantro leaves for garnish method to prepare the brussel sprouts trim the stems and cut any large size brussel sprouts into quarters medium size brussel sprouts can be cut into halves and any small ones can be left whole in a large pot bring salted water to a good boil and carefully add the brussel sprouts cook for minutes drain in a colander and rinse with cold water for a minute or so this will stop the cooking process and set their lovely green color drain well and set aside until needed in a large saute pan on medium high heat add the oil and then carefully add the black mustard seeds they tend to splatter and pop tremendously then add the cumin seeds and the onions stir fry the onions until they are golden brown in color this may take up to minutes next add the garlic and ginger keep stirring so the onion mixture will not burn and then add the turmeric curry leaves dried red chilies salt pepper mix well to combine and then add the brussel sprouts stir once and let sit for minutes the key is to caramelize the brussel sprouts caramelization equals intense flavor stir once and again let the brussel sprouts sit for a few minutes to caramelize once the brussel sprouts are a delicious golden brown in color add the corn and lime juice stir to combine thoroughly reduce the heat to medium low cover and cook for an additional minutes garnish with the cilantro leaves and serve with warm rotis variations try using different vegetables such as zucchini cauliflower green beans potatoes or green peas alu gobi potatoes with cauliflower ingredients tablespoon vegetable oil teaspoon cumin seeds teaspoon minced garlic teaspoon ginger paste medium potatoes peeled and cubed teaspoon ground turmeric teaspoon paprika teaspoon ground cumin teaspoon garam masala salt to taste pound cauliflower teaspoon chopped fresh cilantro directions heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium heat stir in the cumin seeds garlic and ginger paste cook about
