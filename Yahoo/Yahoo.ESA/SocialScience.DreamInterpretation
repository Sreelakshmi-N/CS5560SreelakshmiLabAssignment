does anyone know of a good way to remember particular details of a dream i had a dream and its imperative that i remember specific details from that dream is there a way to bring about total recall of a dream i am a bit of a dream interpretter and i find the best way to recall one is to remember the emotions and feelings you had in the dream often these are more memorable than the actual events they stick in your mind more so once you remember the feelings then the details should present themselves also try to recall the smaller details around you in the dream could you smell cookies or was there a a vase of flowers on the table hope that helps and good luck  Lucid dreaming Unconscious mind Dream Theory of conduct Mnemonic Sigmund Freud Social rule D__j__ vu False memory Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Out-of-body experience Memory Friedrich Schleiermacher Consciousness Parsifal Jon Secada The Star Wars Holiday Special Animism Scientology beliefs and practices Blade Runner John Berryman Care Bears Mat Cauthon Datalore (TNG episode) Carl Jung Avenue Q W.I.T.C.H.

how do i bring on a lucid dream i have had a couple of them very cool ones but would like more how do i bring them on sorry but i don't agree with a few things myopic said i'll answer your question but had to say this reality testing is easier with something simple like looking at a clock twice to see if it changes or try to easily read small text there's also holding your nose like you're going to sneeze and trying to breath through it trying to create people or flying can take more concentration she is right about that you'll want to expect it that does help but nothing's absolute anything can happen in dreams and yes do try them even if you know you're awake same as with the age i too was trained to wake when i had children but i've had more lucid dreams since having children than i ever did when i started ld ing as a child i don't believe my children had anything to do with it because i started having more since i started reading more about it and trying different methods as for her lucid dreams getting boring i guess they might for some people but i can't imagine how even when i just look around in my dreams i think it's awesome i'll wish when i wake i'd thought to control it but still love being lucid what frank is telling you to try is known as the wake back to bed wbtb method it's very common basically what's going on is you're waking up when your rem cycle is strongest dreams are more vivid and easier to remember during this time getting up out of bed helps your conscious wake up when you go back to sleep your body falls asleep but your conscious now has more awareness making it easier to know when your dreaming another common method is mneomonic induction of lucid dream mild people have names for everything don't they as you're laying down repeat to yourself i am dreaming or this is a dream or whatever you can do this when you're going back to bed if you use the former method or by itsself there's also recognizing a dream sign or something that appears in many of your dreams to help you become lucid i believe this is called lucid induction of lucid dream yep lild there's those names again what you should do is definitely read more about lucid dreams but never believe that they only come this way or won't come that way like i said eariler nothing is absolute i've had lucid dreams before i had good dream recall and before i started a dream journal try different methods even if they sound funny or stupid hey if it works  Out-of-body experience Philosophical skepticism Consciousness Sleep Hypnosis Hypnagogia Milton H.

else jacking this dude up for somthing that he owed their boss this guy shows up and start talking to me and we start walking then he changed his eyes into something evil and he spoked differently than before saying that i wasn't right with the lord and that he could do whatever he wanted to do to me at first i accepted it because i was praying that the lord take me home all day at work because i'm tired of everything thats going on in my life then he changed back to normal and said that i have to forgive him cause something that comes over him i felt a lot of fear then i realized that i was up against a principality demon i said to him the lord is with me even if i do have issues then i grabbed the man by the collar and slaped em around until that evil spirt came back and now i'm in my room and i over hear him say that i'm a threat to them and i had to die so they threw fireballs into the room and i put the first two out then i grabed a blanket and slid the window open and ran down the street and have way down my block i heard them say he escaped and they came after me and i whopped their butts until i woke up now i'm woke and the first thing i do is turn the tv off and i prayed and anointed my forehead and upper chest pleading the blood of jesus over me and my room and then i tried to put on some christian music but my cd player start trippin so i cleaned it but it played for a second then it wouldn't work so i put on some oldies and was going to leave the lights on but i turned them off cause i ain't scared then i laided down in hopes of my dream picking up where it left off at i was ready to whip some more demonic butt i forgot to tell you that before i slaped the dude my soul repented before god all of this is true and i don't drink or do drugs just trying to do god's will in my life so can yall help me according to dreamcrowd to dream of being or moving up suggests that you are emerging from some depressing or negative situation you may be feeling high or euphoric the dream may also compensate for your waking feelings of sadness alternatively it signifies that your ego is inflated according to jung some material or repressed thoughts may be emerging from your unconscious to see a guy in your dream denotes the masculine aspect of yourself the side that is assertive rational aggressive and or competitive if the guy is known to you then the dream may reflect you feelings and concerns you have about him if you are a woman and dream that you are in the arms of that guy suggests that you are accepting and welcoming your stronger assertive personality it may also highlight your desires to be in a relationship and your image of the ideal man to see an old guy in your dream represents wisdom or forgiveness see also boy to dream about beginning something in your dream indicates that valuable time has been wasted through procrastination you need to get on with life and put your plans into motion to dream that you are talking does not have any significance unless it is unusual or bizarre consider also if what you say evoke strong feelings or behavioral reactions the dream may simply be highlighting your need improve your communication skills or learn to express yourself more clearly to dream that you are walking with ease represents the way you are moving through life and progress toward your goals consider your destination to dream that you have difficulties walking indicates that you are reluctant and hesitant in proceeding forward in some situation you may also be trying to distance yourself from certain life experiences the difficulty in walking is a reflection of your current situation and the obstacles that you are experiencing to notice eyes in your dream represents expressions of amazement disbelief surprise or doubt it may also indicate concern or disapproval to dream that someone or something is evil denotes a repressed and or forbidden aspect of yourself this part of yourself may be seeking recognition and acknowledgment alternatively evil may also be a reflection of your strong negative emotions like hate anger etc pay attention to details and meanings about yourself and your spiritual progress in life if god is there but not the focus the dream content has an important message for you if god is the focus try to remember your feelings during that part of the dream for clues to the meaning to dream about acceptance indicates issues of self esteem and measuring up to the expectations of others there is a waking situation where you are seeking acceptance and wanting to be a part of to see your home in your dream signifies security basic needs and values you may feel at home at your new job or you finally feel settled and comfortable in a new environment in particular to see your childhood home or a home that you no longer live in suggests your own desires for building a family it also reflects aspects of yourself that were prominent or developed during the time you lived in that home you may experience some feelings or unfinished expression of emotions that are now being triggered by a waking situation to dream that you cannot find your way home indicates that you have lost faith and belief in yourself it may also signify a major transition in your life to dream of a sunny day symbolizes clarity and or pleasantness you are seeing things clearly to dream of a gloomy or cloudy day signifies sadness if you dream of a particular day then you may need to look closely at that day for any significance consider the number associated with that day a certain date could highlight a special anniversary appointment or occasion to dream of the passing of a day indicates that you need to manage your time better and plot out your goals in a more deliberate manner to dream that you are at work indicates that you are experiencing some anxiety about a current project or task the dream may also be telling you that you need to get back to

could someone interpret my dreams ok i have several dreams that i don't get here they are when i was little i kept seeing this dream where i went somewhere and i was surrounded by some apartaments and i couldnt find my way out then a witch came there the same one from my snow white book she said get out of here or ill beat you up i acted like i was very tired and ran out of there cuz i didnt wnat to get beat up i had this dream maybe times in years i have seen other dreams with this witch one where she was invisible one where she was at my grandmas house and beat her one where she was at my house where my dad beat her up and one at the apartments where i fought her and i lost maybe months ago i saw a dream that there was a huge palace and it was gold and pretty i was all dressed up and climbing up the stairs and i was so happy that i was going to this palace the stairs had a red carpet i was more than halfway up the stairs where a black helicopter flies by and shoots me in the heart to have reccurring dreams means there is a message or lesson our subconscious mind is trying to teach us there is something we need to see or hear put into action in our waking world for the recurring dreams to stop your dreams all contain the fairy tale witch from snow white who was actually the evil queen snow whites wicked step mother in disguise do you or did you have a step mother if you do or did were you threatened by her or were you afraid of her in any way if you had or have a step mother what is your relationship like in your dream when you couldn't find your way out were you scared scared to dream that you are scared indicates that you are experiencing self doubt and feelings of incompetence you may be feeling a lack of control anger often masquerades as fear so also consider issues about which you are angry about in your waking life surrounded to feel enclosed or trapped on all sides apartment s to dream about an apartment s symbolizes a financial or situational state to dream of a large lavish apartment indicates a large increase to your income or an improvement to your family life to dream of a shabby and dark apartment indicates misfortune roof s to see a roof in your dream symbolizes a barrier between two states of consciousness it represents a protection of your consciousness mentality and beliefs it is an overview of how you see yourself and who you think you are apartments are buildings so i have included this too building s to see a building s in your dream represents the self and the body you were by yourself until the witch arrived you were also alone with the witch alone to dream that you are alone indicates feelings of rejection you may be feeling that no one understand you abode to dream that you can't find your abode symbolizes your loss of faith in the integrity of others you couldn't find your way out in another dream you fought the witch lost lost to dream that you are lost suggests that you have lost your direction in life or that you have lost sight of your goals you may be feeling worried and insecure about the path you are taking in life alternatively you may be trying to adjust and get accustomed to a new situation in which the rules and conditions are ever changing witch to see a witch in your dream represents evil destructive and dangerous feminine forces it may point to your negative ideas of the feminine and your experiences with heartless women alternatively a witch is symbolic of goodness power and enchantment you pretended to be tired then ran out acting to dream that you are an actor denotes that your hard work and labor will be well worth it in the end it also indicates your strong desires to be recognized and acknowledge this may also be an indication of a role that you are playing in your real life whether it be the role of a parent sibling co worker etc or perhaps you are putting on an act or a facade running to dream that you are running away from someone indicates an issue that you are trying to avoid in particular if you are running from an attacker or any danger then it suggests that you are not facing and confronting your fears to dream that you are running alone signifies that you will advance to a higher position and surpass your friends in the race for wealth alternatively you may be running from some situation or from temptation in the dream where the witch is invisble to dream someone is invisble signifies that their feelings opinions ideas are not of any significant importance where you are concerned they do not matter to you they bear no weight where you are concerned grandmother to see your grandmother in your dream represents nurturance protection and unconditional love consider the qualities and characteristics that exist in your own grandmother father to see your father in your dream symbolizes authority and protection it suggests that you need to be more self reliant consider also your waking relationship with your father in your dreams you seen your grandmother dad both beating up the witch were you being abused by your step mother it is possible you had these dreams to help you deal with the trauma you were experiencing when you were awake you were desperate for protection longed for your grandmother your dad to take action against your step mother to intervene on your behalf perhaps her actions toward you in real life were invisible to them perhaps your dreams were a way for you to have them do to her the same things that she was doing to you in real life your dreams reflect your desire for your grandmother dad to see the truth about your step mother violence to see any act of violence in your dreams such as hitting beating punching slapping indicates unexpressed anger or rage the dream may also reflect repressed memories of child abuse did the witch pursue you pursuit to dream that someone or something is in pursuit of you indicates that you are refusing to acknowledge a certain viewpoint or idea palace to see a palace in your dream symbolizes prominence and wealth you are ready to utilize your full potential you were all dressed up like a princess princess to dream that you are a princess indicates that you are recognizing your full potential you still need to grow more and develop your full character gold the golden color reflects your spiritual rewards richness refinement and enhancement of your surroundings happy to dream that you are happy may be a compensatory dream and is often a dream of the contrary you may be trying to compensate for the sadness or stress in your waking life steps to see steps in your dream represents your efforts in achieving your goals ambition and material gains the dream may be telling you to take things one thing at a time or that you need to take a chance and take that first step toward your goals dreams stairs to dream that you are walking up a flight of stairs indicates that you are achieving a higher level of understanding you are making progress into your spiritual emotional material journey it also represents material and thoughts that are coming to the surface the stairs had red carpet red red is an indication of raw energy force vigor intense passion aggression power courage and passion the color red has deep emotional and spiritual connotations red is also the color of danger shame sexual impulses and urges perhaps you need to stop and think about your actions you were more than halfway up the stairs half to dream about half of something indicates that something in your waking life is incomplete or unresolved it may also indicate that you are only partially acknowledging your feelings you or someone else is limiting or restricting you alternatively the dream may suggest that you need to be open to compromise and meet halfway you were shot at by a black helicopter while climbing the stairs this is a form of sabotage sabotage to dream that you have been sabotaged represents waking conflicts an overwhelming anxiety is threatening the boundary between your unconscious and your ego you need to get rid of your old attitudes and former ways of thinking for instance if you have been the victim of an abusive step mother and you were never rescued or perhaps you were but you still have unresolved issues surrounding the abuse how it affected you could be blocking your path to progress success you could be sabotaging your own progress potential possibly because you feel that you are unworthy of success black black symbolizes the unknown unconscious danger mystery darkness death mourning hate or malice if the feeling in the dream is one of joy blackness could imply hidden spirituality and divine qualities helicopter to see a helicopter in your dream represents your ambition and achievements you are in full pursuit of your goals alternatively you may be experiencing a higher level of consciousness new found freedom and greater awareness shot shooting to dream that someone is shooting you with a gun suggests that you are experiencing some confrontation in your waking life you may feel victimized in some situation heart to see your heart in your dream signifies truth courage love and romance it is representative of how you are currently dealing with your feelings and expressing your emotions also consider the saying the heart of the matter which implies that you may need to get down to the core of a situation before proceeding sorry this is so long you dreams are full of symbollic meanings hope this helps

i keep having a dream like this i keep having different dreams but the same ending my mom always leaves me alone she is always with a person like my stepdad or brother i hate it what can i do to stop having these nightmares what does it mean really recurring dreams can be highly useful and important to analyze they happen for one of two reasons they reflect an unhealthy pattern that you have fallen into in real life and they are trying to show you that your behaviour is not helping you be happy or they represent unresolved feelings such as anger or sadness over a past situation that you have not healed from in many recurring dreams your sleeping self is trying to solve a problem or confront an emotion that you are unable to face in real life whatever the subject of your recurring dream is you can be sure it is reflecting something in your current life situation even if the dream takes you back in time think carefully about what in your life might be causing you continual stress or worry mothers in dreams usually invoke powerful emotions if you are dreaming about your mother you may be addressing some real life issues or concerns about your mother in your dream or your dream may be based on a valuable memory the general image of mother in a dream may symbolize a variety of feelings and ideas caring nurturing love acceptance hard work sacrifice etc the mother in your dream could also represent that force or current inside of you that nudges you on and inspires you it is your intuition and the knowledge that lives deep within your soul to see your stepfather in your dream symbolizes authority it suggests that you need to be more self reliant consider also your waking relationship with your stepfather a dream about your real brother should be interpreted according to your real life relationship sorry for making it long but at this point i think its obvious this dream is a straight up representation about the relationship with your mom stepdad and brother the reason why youre dreaming it over and over is because its unresolved you havent confronted the issue in real life good luck i know its stressful for you wish u all the best  Dream Characters of The Sandman Narcissism Sigmund Freud Scenes from a Memory Simone Weil W.I.T.C.H.

sexual dreams its kind of odd for me to ask but lately me and my ex have been talking and lately she has also been having these dreams of an erotic nature and they always include me in the act although under different setting each time i was just wondering what could these dreams mean to her sexual dreams are often straight forward representations of our desires for other people sex in a dream can also signify our need to bond with or gain power over others as others have probably already told you she still likes you  Human sexual behavior Sexual orientation Group sex Heterosexuality Pedophilia Zoophilia Fiddler on the Roof Motion picture rating system Human sexuality Pornographic actor Avenue Q Bondage (BDSM) BDSM Paraphilia Love Pederasty Oral sex Homosexuality Homosexuality and transgender Reparative therapy Gender role Hentai Sadism and masochism Anal sex Cybersex Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Characters of The Sandman Inhibited sexual desire Homophobia David and Jonathan Gender Seduction Queer Poker jargon Swinging Gay Sexual arousal Child pornography Choice and sexual orientation Transgender Phone sex Eyes Wide Shut Domination & submission (BDSM) Strap-on dildo Sex toy Sexual attraction Yiff Bisexuality The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Homosexuality and Christianity Power (sociology) Salad Fingers One Piece minor characters Miss Saigon Sex reassignment surgery Fisting Sexual fantasy Novel Mulholland Drive (film) Slash fiction Cross-dressing W.I.T.C.H.

psychic my dream was of a family gathering at a near by river and i was helping my grandmother down a water slide suddenly my hand slipped and we both went down at the same time when got to the water my great aunt from the other side of the family told us we needed to get out because there was a dead little girl and a snake in the water we did i told my mother a few days later and she told me the there was a body found in that river the day after i dreamed it am i psychic or is it just coincidence there are two separate issues involved a dream interpretation precognition and evaluation of your psychic skills one dream is not enough for the evaluation however it makes sense for you to learn more about psychic gifts and in my opinion your dream urges you to develop your own gifts good luck  Parapsychology W.I.T.C.H.

dream interpretation question now bear in mind that i've never been in a car accident of any sort but nonetheless i had this dream last night very brief where i didn't see anything i just heard screeching and then this big crash also i've never witnessed a major car crash just a ew fender benders so what could this mean a dream analyst on a local radio station in santa barbara once said that dreams are usually not about what you are experiencing in the dream for example if you have a dream about crashing in an airplane this dream is not about your underlying fear of flying i'm no expert in this field but i'm guessing that your dream is really about some fear you have of not having control over a situation  Roswell UFO incident American Pie (song) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Wheel of Fortune Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Road traffic accident A Day in the Life Fixed-wing aircraft Unidentified flying object Dream One Tree Hill (TV series) Accidents and incidents in aviation Melanie Thornton Pop punk Green Day Waylon Jennings 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Philosophical skepticism 24 Hours of Le Mans United Airlines Flight 93 Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Plame affair Minority Report (film) Air safety Roxette Sigmund Freud Futurama (TV series - season 5) Psychoanalysis Tenerife disaster Mumia Abu-Jamal Speed limit American Dreams Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Hearsay The X-Files (season 1) Knots Landing Major League Baseball television contracts United Airlines Flight 232 Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!

i had a weird dream last night can somone spread some light on what it might mean i was outside in a crowded area and suddenly it was armageddon huge comets were falling from the sky and things were exploding all around and in the sky as well it is really getting to me because normally i can't remember any dreams i have but this one i do remember so there must be reason why right when we dream we do so in symbols because it is easier to deal with than when we are awake dreams are problems that we are having in our lives they do not portend the future there is something very explosive going on in your life right now something that you are either not aware of or you are refusing to do anything about the only way this dream is going away is to figure out what the problem is and deal with it to do this you may need to go somewhere where it is quiet and peaceful and you won''t be bothered so that you can be comfortable and relaxed then you need to take a very critical look at your life take a look at your past your present and see what is going on that you are not handling well it might be something that although might be a future event is something that is coming up soon and you don't want to face it if you can do this then your problem will go away and so will the dream this could be only about you it could be about about another person or about several other people good luck  Lucid dreaming Dream Scenes from a Memory Impact event The Amber Spyglass Jon Secada Insomnia Social rule Jiddu Krishnamurti Out-of-body experience Cliff Richard Sleep Avenue Q Journey (band) Philosophical skepticism Dream Theater Piccolo Junior Saga Miss Saigon Carlos Castaneda Asteroid Aerosmith Sin City Tribulation Escape from New York End times Pok__mon Live!

fight club dream i had a dream where from what i remember i was in a somewhat run down fighting hub where you could only use your fists and whoever messes up the other guy's nose first wins the thing was that while i did get a couple good hits in i was constantly doing poorly mainly making contact but doing hardly any damage very weak but i still won both of my matches the second one because my opponent never tried to hit me yet was still confident for some reason does this mean i need to strengthen myself in some way thanks according to http www soulfuture com dream dictionary symbols f fight dream dictionary asp fighting might symbolize unresolved internal conflict seeing a tough time through an unconscious stance of resistance against something that needs to be acknowledged feeling a need to defend or protect yourself competing with others and nose clarifies the issue a bit self recognition nose bleeds may symbolize feeling unacknowledged unappreciated or unnoticed prying snooping invading someone else s privacy nosing around it seems quite a few issues need resolving i would suggest you try to meditate or day dream and determine your priorities and appropriate action i hope it helps good luck  Boxing Professional wrestling Mixed martial arts Lincoln-Douglas Debate Social rule Password Leon White Trademark The Contender (television series) Sigmund Freud Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Poker jargon Psychoanalysis Dream Karen Horney Consciousness Wing Chun Characters of Naruto Twelve Swords of Power Diving Martial art Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Fencing Deconstruction 2003 Invasion of Iraq Roe v.

dreaming you are at the same place on different ocasions i had a dream once that i was in a place i have never been before and it was a lovely place where i would like to go one day the next time i dreamt i was at the same place but with my family as if it was like years ago and my grandfather who passed away looking happy and healthy trying to cheer me up and saying goodbye to me i was sad as i was going away then i dreamt again that i was at the same place but with no one else has anyone had a similar dream or knows if there is any meaning behind these family to see your own family in your dream represents security warmth and love consider also the significance of a particular family member or the relationship you have with them death to dream about the death of a loved one suggests that you are lacking a certain aspect or quality that the loved one embodies ask yourself what makes this person special or what do you like about him it is that very quality that you are lacking in your own relationship or circumstances alternatively it indicates that whatever that person represents has no part in your own life places to dream of a certain place is telling of your inner state of mind consider your own personal feelings and memories with that particular place from what i get out of all this is that when you where younger your life made more scene and it was safer life right now might not be all that you want and you miss what you once had with all your loved ones and a happy place that you all gathered to about you grandfather if you had a special relationship with him then it could be that you are missing him or what he brought to your life what you need to do right now is think of every thing that is missing in your life and try to get it back to where it needs to be so that you can be happy once again i hope that i helped  Scenes from a Memory Yoga Sutras of Patanjali One Tree Hill (TV series) Miss Saigon The Amber Spyglass Pitaten Infantilism Cliff Richard Past teachings of Prem Rawat The McGuire Sisters Care Bears Objectivist philosophy Dream Saudade Meaning of life Marilyn Monroe Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Star Wars Holiday Special Jon Secada Reincarnation Consciousness Narcissism Arjuna Force (Star Wars) Please Save My Earth Karen Horney W.I.T.C.H.

recurring dream slightly altered i have had this dream once before probably a year ago i woluld go into detail but its a really long dream that is pretty much andaction movie but i was wondering why this time i dreampt it that i realized i had had the dream before and wheile the things were going i i knew how last time i had done something wrong so this time i changed it slightly how come this nd time i could change it and what does that meazn when you realize you are dreaming it's called lucid dreaming it is an often sought after state because it allows you to alter and direct the contents of your dream thisoften involves flying which can be wonderful the recurring dream is a sign you need to work on something the fact that the awareness of dreaming kicked in shows that you have learned your lesson and have taken control of your life congrats some spiritual people see lucid dreaming as a precursor to enlightenment because it underscores the fact that we ultimately create and control our own world  Lucid dreaming Dream Scenes from a Memory Carlos Castaneda Carl Jung Consciousness Meaning of life Jumpstart 3rd Grade The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Lisp programming language A Course In Miracles Milton H.

i had the weirdest dream ever does it mean anything my friends and me were spies i think and this fat guy i think i auditioned for a play of his months ago was there i forget why but we were spying on him or something then he and other people and they were chasing us in cars and he caught us then he locked us is my basement but everything was padded so we couldn't hurt our selves because he thought we had mental problems everything was padded the fridge had blue leather material with fluff in side it all over it everything was like that so we couldn't hurt our selves even the bath tub then we escaped threw the window and were scared he would see and get us then we were in my backyard not scared he would see us there's big glass windows and a balcony so in real life he could we had a cheetah on a leash and were walking with it that's all i can remember but does it mean anything thankyou so much according to dreamcrowd to see your friends in your dream signifies aspects of your personality that you have rejected but are ready to integrate these rejected part of yourself the relationships you have with those around you are important in learning about yourself additionally this symbol foretells of happy tidings from them and the arrival of good news to see your childhood friend in your dream signifies regression into your past where you had no responsibilities and things were much simpler and carefree you may be wanting to escape the the pressures and stresses of adulthood consider the relationship you had with this friend and the lessons that were learned alternatively the childhood friend may be suggesting that you have been acting in a childish manner and you need to start acting like an adult to dream that your best friend is dying suggests that some aspect or quality that your best friend possess is dying within your own self to dream that you are fat signifies a fortunate change in your life or you may be overindulgent a more literal interpretation of this dream is your fears of gaining weight you have an skewed perception of your own image which may stem from low self esteem to dream that others are fat signifies prosperity try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  EastEnders Shaggy dog story W.I.T.C.H.

really bad dream ok i had this dream that my mother was on her death bed she was almost all gone and i could not find a way to go see her but the crazy thing was that every one was at my house my dad and sisters and they had there friends over and they were all drinking what do ya make of that dreams are made up of symbols that help us deal with problems that we face during the day the symbols help make it easier for us to deal with in my opinion i think you are feeling like the only person to take responsibilities in your life that you feel all alone and that no one cares about anything but you i think these feelings of responsibilities are making you feel trapped and unable to fulfill your responsibilities and that no one else notices this while you are doing what you know has to be done you feel that every one else is just kickin' back and enjoying life  Social rule Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) Pitaten Shaggy dog story About a Boy Friends W.I.T.C.H.

do dreams have meanings if if you dream the same thing twice i had a dream today and i know that i dreamt it before long ago i remember what happened in my dream when i first had it and i stopped it from happening today my st dream excerpt i was on a wooden yacht with this guy name jonathan test i never heard of him or seen him and he was my boyfriend in my dream and then there were alot of other guys and the water was icy cold and i came out of this room with jonathan and my friend was talking on the phone then she said what can i give you to get my ticket and she hung up and took something out of her bag it was mine it was foiled up and inside it was these rare shells and i put it in her bag before cause i didnt carry a bag or anything and she takes it out and all of a sudden it turns into a ticket and we fight cause it was mine and she traded it with someone so she can get a ticket my nd dream its the same just not the ticket part i remembered this part it felt like de ja vu to me and i remembered when my friend was on the phone and i knew what was gonna happen so i took her bag and took my shells and stood next to my boyfriend then my friend that was on the phone started shouting and yelling where is the damn shells johnathan and i knew that i had it cause it was mine so i hid it behind me and she came to us asking where it was and johnathan stood up for me so instead he made a lie and asked his friends that was on the second floor up above to throw the shells they threw a little box and inside he put in of my shells and gave it to her she was happy and she got her ticket and i still had my shells then i went up to her and said those were my shells give it to me i wanted her to tell me sorry but she didnt she said what are you talking about those were mine and i slapped her and she said sorry does this have any meaning at all having the same dream and knowing what will happen so i prevented it it sounds to me like you have either lost something pressious to this friend in the past or you are afraid of it happening in the future but since you were able to stop it in the second dream perhaps you have done something to resolve the past event or you feel more securew with your friendship you boyfriend in the dream sticking up for you might signify that that new security comes from someone like him in your life is there someone in you life that acts like jonathan test if there is you may want to get to know him better your dream might be telling you that you feel safe around him also you friend doesn't seem that trustworthy or at least she seems stuborn i'd space myself from her if i were you hope this helps  Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Columbine High School massacre The Inside Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Ocean's Twelve Futurama (TV series - season 5) One Tree Hill (TV series) One Piece minor characters Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Lovely Bones The Star Wars Holiday Special Episodes of Lost (Season 2) StarCraft: Uprising The Ashlee Simpson Show Scenes from a Memory Avenue Q Pok__mon Live!

does this dream mean anything last night i had a dream that i was handed a gun and i used it to commit suicide normally i wouldnt think anything of it but i have issues with depression and self harm im fourteen years old and i was wondering if this is a sign of anything i used to go to a therapist for about six months but my mom had me stop going last month any ideas would be appreciated part of my depression does come from my father he has been depressed his whole life and in october he had to be put in a hospital for his illness could that be the person behind it you probably answered your own question since you have some sort of depression in reality projecting having a hand gun to commit suicide is a way to release your depression in reality in other words there are things that you dare not to do it in real life but you wanted to try it in dream dreaming is one of the ways people use it to escape from reality it is no exception in your case however sometimes if we manifest the problem it will get worse it all depends on the problem if you get to a point that you can control your depression i think you should stop going to a therapist or you may get worse for example some people will get sicker by seeing a doctor the doctor will discover reveal more problems that is good thing but if after discovery there is no cure that will become worse therapist or doctor tends to understand your problem first fixing it is another issue that is why i said if you can understand your problem in your case depression if you can fix it yourself try to do it get someone you can rely on and talk it out of course if you get to a point that you can't stand anyone and you need some professional to help you by all means that will be your last resource and i wish you well that i could understand why your mom wanted you to stop many people have that mentality that seeing a doctor will get sicker the truth of the matter is seeing a doctor will help you understand more the problem but the doctor won't promise to heal you as far as dream goes it is a release of what you can't do in reality don't take it so seriously about it they are only symbols some people will be stupid enough to listen to their own subconscious mind or dream symbols literally you are not telling yourself to kill yourself you are just telling yourself you are seeking help gun power support commit suicide giving up you may be giving up something in life in your case depression and gun is power or support in symbol it can end your life if you translate literally but it also means support you are seeking for support in that translation good luck  Suicide Theory of conduct Clinical depression Philosophy of language Simone Weil Reiki Transsexuality Reparative therapy Psychiatric hospital Contract Autism Bipolar disorder Milton H.

ok dream interpreters answer me this strange dream i was on the titanic with my grandma she had a goblet and dressing gown night dress thing she was proud of because they were heirlooms or something as the titanic started sinking we decided to get off as fast as possible i dunno where my grandma went but i'm pretty sure me and harry potter recently watched it so that's probably why i still think it's funny were trying to find a way off the boat we got on the safe side couldn't explain it to yah if i knew when they were telling us to get back on the other side so they could use us as weights to level the boat everyone knew it was ridiculous and kept running into the water away from titanic so after the struggle i was in my grandmas garage she asked me why i didn't go back and get the goblet and dressing gowns i felt so ashamed but i wanted to get off because you know it was kinda sinking so we then went to like mcdonald burger king place and we all ordered smoothies and i order like hamburgers and a happy meal so it was time to go and i put all the hamburgers in my happy meal box we drove around and my cousin wanted more food so we were trying to find a drive thru i guess and i woke up strangest thing a lot of this sounds like everyday stuff like from the movie you saw etc but you're a survivior that's for sure and you don't wnat to let grandma down but you put your priorities straight and she obviously loves and forgives you because you all were happy right after i couldn't think of a better dream family  EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Phoebe Buffay's songs Hamburger Grandview, U.S.A.

what could this mean i continuously have the same dream i defy all logic and survive all these horific disasters while everyone around me doesn't i'm a bit confused with what it could mean these disasters range from fires to earthquakes in this dream i just stand still and watch as everyone is killed my friends and family the oddest thing about this all is that i'm never upset nor happy when they're gone it comes down to basic apathy it's just really bad because it's in third person and i can't force my body to do anything i think that your mind is afraid of being solitary and alone perhaps you are already alone and you hate it you should go out with friends more take breaks and meet some new people if you feel happy in your dream once you're the last one then you might secretly want to be solitary perhaps you are to busy or don't like you firends it all depends on the details of the dream and how you feel even the disasters might have somethin to do with the dream  Theory of conduct Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Jam (TV series) Shaggy dog story God Emperor of Dune Avenue Q W.I.T.C.H.

do you believe in this i have had a very unfortunate life suffered childhood abuse and have had one abusive relationship after another i have also always had the most vivid nightmares since i was a kid hardly ever having good dreams i would thrash as a child and would hurt my feet from kicking the wall whilst asleep and the nightmares have got worse as i've got older and i often dream of someone being in my room wanting to kill me so when i wake i'm still scared i've recently read a book called the secret given by a friend and it's about positive thinking and how you can change your life through your thoughts and that like attracts like and you will bring good things to you by thinking good thoughts call me crazy but i totally believe in this and in the couple of weeks since reading it have for the first time in my life felt in love with myself at peace positive and really believe in myself and that happiness is going to rule my life from now on so many good things have happened to me in the last couple of weeks just little things but enough to be noticeable then last night i had a good dream i always dream i m being chased and always wake up at the point that i die in the dream last night i dreamt that instead of being caught i ran from the bad people and found the gateway to a parallel universe one they couldn t enter exactly the same world so much so i had to look back in my dream to check but it felt good my friends were there and i could sense that this world was my new world and i would be happy there i woke up feeling so amazing so happy so calm and so rest assured can it be true that my nightmares are banished can it be true that through all my positive belief and thoughts the last few weeks i have really brought happiness to my door at last i think so do you absolutely your attitude toward yourself and others directly affects how people treat you which directly affects your feelings toward yourself and so on and so on if you treat yourself as a victim people will victimize you i'm sorry to hear that you had such a bad life i never like to hear about childhood abuse realize though that it is not your fault you should have no guilt over this you didn't do anything wrong the abusers are the guilty party accept this fact and become strong from it you are strong you are beautiful you need to be happy and secure with yourself you cannot find this in another person you cannot be happy with another person unless you are happy with yourself when you are happy and confident people will flock to you because you compliment them not because they can control you stop the cycle of abuse postive thinking positive results but there must be action as well ditch the abusers they aren't worth your time  Theory of conduct Philosophical skepticism Shaggy dog story EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) Jon Secada Transactional analysis Scenes from a Memory Lucid dreaming Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knots Landing The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Infantilism Goodness and value theory Alcoholics Anonymous The Catcher in the Rye Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare God Emperor of Dune Utilitarianism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) Sigmund Freud Out-of-body experience K' Pitaten W.I.T.C.H.

having really messed up dreams what do they mean lately ive been having these wierd series of dreams its like every night continues the dream of the night before and their very sad dreams i dream of dying but im still aware of everything around me and also of being raped and being a prostitute im only i dont think i should be having these kinds of dreams but i feel like theyre trying to tell me something some dreams can be from the enemy and are him trying to weaken your defenses to get you to think the way he wants you to other dreams can be from god but reveal the enemies plans and assist you in how to pray other dreams are from god and his plans for you other dreams can just be nonsense or you just don't understand them as a child i used to have frequent nightmares from the enemy my mother discovered jesus christ and told me about him as a child i would pray for jesus protection before i went to bed and that his angels would guard me i also asked god that he would make me his warrior even in my dreams as i knew i had had encounters with demonic entities in my dreams and could feel them evern after i woke up i have had much success and even in my dreams i have become aware and rebuke the enemy in my dream in jesus name and the dream will come to a halt usualy waking me up there is usualy still and evil presence felt but i know how to take authority over that as god has give jesus a name above all name that every knee should bow and every tongue confess that jesus is lord and that the demons fear his name worshiping god also causes the negative presence to flee as well so i recomend both speaking out them to be gone in jesus name and praising the lord in the midst of the presence till you feel peace now for understanding in dreams it is good to ask god for that as daniel did in the bible if you don't know your bible i would recomend you read it and hang out with people who do and know god and have experiences to share so that you can learn from their experiences and gain your own most of all talk to god and ask him for his plan in your life and that you will know his son jesus try this web site if you want to read the bible www blueletterbible org i recomend starting with the new testament in mathew mark luke and john and then moving to acts and also pray god will teach you and give you knowledge of what you are reading  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sabbath John the Baptist Christian eschatology Holy Spirit Angel New Testament John Howard Yoder Book of Isaiah Dispensationalism Christianity Christian views of Jesus New Testament view on Jesus' life God Sola fide Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Mary, the mother of Jesus Ten Commandments Eastern Orthodox Church Resurrection of Jesus Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Eucharist Book of Mormon Biblical canon Characters of The Sandman Mary Magdalene Original sin End times Jesus Baptism Emanuel Swedenborg Antichrist Names and titles of Jesus Protestantism Christian anarchism Joseph of Arimathea Satan Apostle Slow Train Coming Saint Peter Saint James the Just Genesis Fundamentalism Virgin Mary in Islam Matthew 2 Church of Christ Gospel of Thomas Aramaic of Jesus Joseph Smith, Jr. Gospel of Mark Demon The Pilgrim's Progress Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Devil Agap__ Abraham Historical Jesus Meaning of life Prayer in Christianity Religious Society of Friends Dream Soul Gospel of John Baptist First Book of Nephi God Emperor of Dune Mass (liturgy) Judas Iscariot Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Charismatic Sant Thakar Singh Idolatry Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Hell Knots Landing Pentecostalism EastEnders Kabbalah Miss Saigon Priesthood (Mormonism) The Death Gate Cycle Apocrypha Mortification of the flesh Roman Catholic Church John Wesley Apocalypse King James Version of the Bible Christian views of women Coptic Christianity Book of Joshua InterFaith Isa Philipp Melanchthon

i had a disturbing dream what does it mean i dreamed i was in a big bright white kitchen and my long departed grandmother was there this other person that i knew years ago had just cut off the tail of a little white and black cat and as horrified as i was by this i picked up the pieces of the tail and put them into the dust bin so as not to have my gran upset then the little cat jumped up into my arms it was in pain and i noticed that it's eyes were weeping blood it was crying blood i don't normally dream in colour but the cats eyes were crying red blood it was getting on my shirt as well and i decided that i had to take the cat to a vet right away then i awoke so anyone have any ideas what the heck it all means thanks in advance for any help wowee what a dream it's more useful in dream analysis to try and remember how you felt during the dream and what the different elements mean to you which is not always that simple all that crap about how dreaming about red cars means you're going to lose an arm in an industrial accident or whatever is rubbish how did you feel about the room and about your grandmother being there sad calm excited at home or in a strange place did you feel angry or just horrified when this person cut off the cat's tail was your first instinct to go after the person to help the cat or to protect your grandmother and how did you feel about the position you were put in and the decision you made how did you feel when the cat was bleeding and crying and you had to take it to the vet upset or guilty or irritated or anxious how did you feel to have woken up relieved to have escaped the situation or frustrated that you weren't able to see it through to its conclusion does this person or the cat mean anything to you that you understand immediately dreams often call upon long forgotten fragments of our experiences and imagination to make sense of emotions and uncertainties that are playing upon us now often from childhood or from events which didn't seem to affect us too much at the time but has left some conclusion or impact on our subconsious if you've got time to find a quiet place and try and relive the dream and acknowldedge the emotions that came with it for a few minutes then you might be able to access something that you're subconsiously going through now or make sense of some murmuring changing feeling that you weren't quite sure of and perhaps even find some resolution cool have fun hx  Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Lucid dreaming Pitaten Scenes from a Memory Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind God Emperor of Dune Piccolo Junior Saga Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Piece minor characters Dream Miss Saigon Cat Little Britain The Contender (television series) One Tree Hill (TV series) The Death Gate Cycle Characters of Naruto Time Out of Mind Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Milton H.

unusual dream correct interpretation please in my dream when i looked out of my rd floor house i could see only darkness though it was during the day it was unusually dark as i looked out the south facing window i saw that it was raining very heavily and there was a very strong gale behind the silhouettes of coconut trees i could see a large bright white moon like orb going oscillating like a pendulum i felt tremors and thought it was an earthquake and tried to hide myself after sometime i went near the window and i saw that the entire town is flooded and a strong water current is flowing right below my rd floor window and rising steadily i am frantically looking for a place to go and think of moving to the terrace taking my mother in law who stays with me at the back of my mind i was worried about where my child in school and my husband at work were immediately after this i woke up with a start feeling very disturbed it was am i never get such wild dreams what could this mean the fact that you were so disturbed and could remember it so vividly means that this is an important dream houses often mean either the desire to feel safe or refers to the structure of your psyche i think in your case it was the first water often refers to the unconscious floods and a fear of water means that you are afraid of your unconscious and the power it holds some aspect that you are ignoring and has become part of your unconscious is threatening to flood your personality and drown you what this aspect is i can only guess the moon and pendulums oscillating are both measures of time although what the trees mean i can only guess darkness is often associated with fear and the unknown you fear for your family what will this unconscious part of my personality do to them how old are you due for a thirty something or midlife crisis especially the midlife crisis is often associated with unassimilated material because the first part of your life is associated with the exterior world in the end only you can truly say what this dream means to you hope this helps  Dream Tide Modernism Drowning Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Amber Spyglass Psychoanalysis Apollo 8 Ekadasi Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Jon Secada Tsunami Unconscious mind Sigmund Freud Volcano Analytical psychology Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) The Parting of the Ways Tenshinhan Mount Pinatubo Autism Seismometer Supernatural Narcissism 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Seismic retrofit Deluge (mythology) Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Karen Horney Earthquake 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Scientology beliefs and practices Philosophical skepticism Hurricane Wilma The Star Wars Holiday Special Out-of-body experience Lucid dreaming Pompeii 2005 Kashmir earthquake Geology of the Moon Bad Wolf Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sento The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever Aerial (dance move) Bene Gesserit Cliff Richard Psychology of religion Force (Star Wars) Fernando Pessoa Datalore (TNG episode) Maxwell's equations Moon Pitaten Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Columbine High School massacre Climate of the United Kingdom Infantilism Freeters Mercury 4 Gnosticism Theory of conduct Sydney Riot of 1879 Toa Saturn Comanche Transactional analysis The Time Machine Poker jargon Gravity 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Quantum mechanics Jam (TV series) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Dean Koontz El Ni__o 1997 Pacific hurricane season Eldfell Milton H.

to many people why do dreams have to mean something in your life there is even section on dream interpretaion in yahoo answers i never think of them as a crystal ball are they not simply residual thoughts from the day that keep the mind active and alive in your sleep the mind doesn't die in your sleep but it's not really being controlled so any old rubbish moves about in it i've read somewhere that dreams are a way to empty the inbox of the brain they do have meanings its nothing supernatural its ur sub conscious trying to indicate something i believe may be the instinct but at times they are absolutely meaningless have u noticed at times when u sleep thinking that life sucks and in the morning u wake up watching a very pleasant dream and u think nothing ever went wrong so they also prevent u from getting into depression  Dream Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Lucid dreaming Soul Meaning of life Insomnia About Schmidt Narcolepsy Sigmund Freud Edgar Cayce Unconscious mind Avenue Q Human Consciousness Sleep Psychosis Hypnosis Parsifal S__ren Kierkegaard Philosophy of mind Atheism Datalore (TNG episode) Fight Club Abortion debate Out-of-body experience Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Animism Person Oneiromancy Reality Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Urinary incontinence 50 First Dates Mind Vegeta Miss Saigon Jiddu Krishnamurti The Amber Spyglass Shaggy dog story Bad Wolf Friedrich Schleiermacher Oh My Goddess!

unusual dream need help ok i was in a local theatre and i use to work there real life i remember being in the elevator projectionist and hearing of a fire and we had an alarm my initial reaction was to help everybody remind you i have not seen any fire and i only know that its going on well i got off the elevator and from what i remember my co worker and acquaintance worked with at the theatre ended up popping in some part of my dream on the elevator and i was guiding him on what to do with helping others the thing is that my coworker shot himself less than a year ago and is dead i am sure it was him in my dream but i find it hard to believe well everything calmed down and i ended up looking around for my ex same county firefighter once the firefighters were leaving i did not see him but i ran into my family i never seen one flame weird a few things i noticed your ex was a firefighter you used to work there you coworker was dead that dream of fire or alarm could be related to what you have experienced either from your ex or your job however elevator decision making guiding him on what to do with helping others seeking support fire alarm alert reminder dead coworker feeling loss it seems like in reality you are into some sort of decision making you tend to be in control in many ways however projecting fire alarm in your dream shows that you have to make up your mind somehow in some sort of decision making you may think you are able to do it yourself however subconsciously you are seeking help projecting people needing your help shows subconsciously you are in charge however that is flip side of it you are feeling loss co worker is dead because there is so much you can do in life and basically you are seeking help but you do not want people to know  Infantilism Firefighter Out-of-body experience Lucid dreaming Dream Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Unconscious mind Yoga Sutras of Patanjali The nature of God in Western theology Fire fighting Unemployment Elevator Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Alcoholics Anonymous Daylight saving time Avenue Q Aerosmith Year of the Spider Fight Club Honey and Clover Colony in Space Journey (band) Scientology beliefs and practices Glossary of firefighting equipment Prostate cancer Glossary of firefighting terms K' Anarchism and society Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Psychoanalysis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Mother Transactional analysis Derren Brown Burglar alarm EastEnders Jean Grey Bushfire Aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks W.

who should i see about dreams that come true i just want to know if theres a specialist i could go see for help or direction on my dreams i tend to have dreams every so often about an image or a story that comes true for example i had a dream about a plane crash then a few days later there was a plane crash its not something i'm scared of i would just like some direction on what i should do i don't know of any professional who could help you in any way my mother and i have both had dreams that came true she had dreams about my car accidents the nights before i believe she may forseen an accident which she warned me about so i didn't drive the next day thus i had no accident i dreamt of planes crashing into buildings in the weeks before scared the crap out of me when it happened i felt like i should have done something but i know there was no way i could have prevented it most of my premonitions occur while i'm awake i've learned to go with my instincts one example once i was watching tv when i heard what sounded like an old bombing raid siren i went outside to see what it was i saw nothing but the siren started getting louder i lit a cigarette and decided to wait to see if something would happen about seconds later i looked up to see a young lady walking down the street saying no leave me alone to a car following her the siren stopped as the lady approached an alley the car sped up and pulled into the alley the car stopped blocking her path and a man got out and started to walk toward her she screamed no get away from me at that point i walked into the street and said do you need some help mam the man looked at me ran back to his car and sped off she said she didn't know him and that he had begun following her block up the street i believe i prevented a kidnapping and who knows what else my advice is this go with your instincts you probably could not have done anything about the plane crash but if you have a dream in which someone you know gets hurt or something on a small scale like that go ahead and try to warn them you may save a life and since you've noticed this ability pay attention to your gut feelings when you're awake who knows what else you might be capable of  Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Scenes from a Memory The Shining (film) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.

weird dream i had i had a dream about this guy that i knew from a few years ago i see him once a year hardly because he lives in new jersey and i live in connecticut we barely talked to each other but everytime i talked to him i felt so good and i just couldn't stop thinking about him for a long time we both were friends on myspaces but rarely talked and if we did it would be about a band that we both liked i don't know if he notices that and feels the same way as i do but my dream dealt with him living in my town and he's like talking to me and confessing to me his secrets i dont know if they're real or not but he's just talking to me and we're acting as if we're best friends that's basically what my dream was now my question is is this what i want either a friendship or a relationship with this guy do i want him to talk to me or make the first move because i know i want to but i don't and i don't know what's holding me back i'm usually not shy either please explain my dream well i'm not a dream expert but i would say you would like something more with this man than just seeing him usually if you dream about something it's because it's something that you are really thinking of alot and you can't get it out of your head kinda like if you see a scary movie and then you go to bed and have a nightmare it's cause you are still thinking of the scary movie and you have scary thoughts in your head i would say to be honest with yourself and with him think about it really hard and see the pros and cons how would it work out if you did get serious with him and if it does not work out how would you handle losing a friend dreams are dreams you are going to have to figure this out in real life a dream can just be something you want and not reality he might be giving the signs to you but thinking something else just talk to him if he is as good of a friend as you think he is he should not mind and he would appreciate your honesty hope this helps  The Ashlee Simpson Show Jon Secada Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) Knots Landing Jean Grey Lucid dreaming K' Cliff Richard Out-of-body experience Friends Dream The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan The Lovely Bones Humphrey Bogart Avenue Q Scenes from a Memory Sigmund Freud Theory of conduct Doris Day Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Social rule God Emperor of Dune The Life and Times of Juniper Lee W.I.T.C.H.

i keep having dreams about guys i don't know last nite i had a dream that i met this guy at a party and we were really in to eachother but he said he is so i did not want anything to do with him cuz am and he's then few night's ago i had a dream about a hot guy named ryan who is way way older then me i think he is over but that is the only person i knew in my dream's it's like every nite i met someone else i don't know y it's weird then i had a dream about my stalker i did have one in real life she was in love with me and she would email me all the time and say very nasty and sexural things y am i thinking about that scary lady again and guy's i dont know am not scared of boys i have had boyfriends i told my best friend about that weird lady and my friend said something to her and she left me alone maybe it's trying to say that you shouldn't judge someone by their age for both scenarios with the guys you seemed to like them but you didn't do anything b c of their age and about the stalker it's kinda hard not to dream about scary things in life dreams are usually your thoughts in the back of your head that sometimes appear in your dreams so if something like a stalker was upsetting you or you just thought about it for a second you probably thought about it more in your dreams the best way to not dream about this stalker is to tell a close person that way there's a chance that you won't dream about it  Jon Secada Friends Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart The Ashlee Simpson Show Scenes from a Memory The Lovely Bones Hall & Oates "Weird Al" Yankovic EastEnders Guy Chambers Phoebe Buffay's songs Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sin City Marilyn Monroe Time Out of Mind Blood on the Tracks Extras (sitcom) Mary Jane Watson Social rule Daz Dillinger Jean Grey The Amber Spyglass The Inside Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Jeopardy! in culture Cliff Richard The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Fictional crossover Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Transactional analysis Miss Saigon The Smoking Room Thinks ...

why do i keep dreaming of water its weird because ever since i was i have had the same dream its different because its has different people in it and the story has changed however the scenery and the river remains the same at the start of the dream the water is very low and we have to walk round it for whatever reason i am relutant and scared but i know i have to do it as we walk along the water starts to come up the banking and we have to waid through it and it starts to get very fast and the current strong we do eventually get to where we are going but when it is time to go home the water is very high am very scared to leave the spot of where i am but the water starts to pour onto the land am standing my friends with me dont hestiate and head into the water i do eventually get back to the other side but when i do the dream starts all over again water to see water in your dream symbolizes your unconscious and your emotional state of mind water is the living essence of the psyche and the flow of life energy it is also symbolic of spirituality knowledge healing and refreshment if the water is calm clear then it signifies that you are in tune with your spirituality it denotes serenity peace of mind and rejuvenation if you are splashed by water then it represents your need to be revitalized and more expressive to dream that water is boiling suggests that you are expressing some emotional turmoil it also may mean that feelings from your unconscious are surfacing and ready to be acknowledged to see muddy or dirty water in your dream indicates that you are wallowing in your negative emotions you may need to devote some time to clarify your mind and find internal peace alternatively it suggests that your thinking judgment is unclear and clouded if you are immersed in muddy water then it indicates that you are in over your head in a situation and are overwhelmed by your emotions to hear running water in your dream denotes meditation reflection and pondering of your thoughts and emotions to dream that you are walking on water suggests that you have supreme and ultimate control over your emotions it may also suggest that you need to stay on top of your emotions and not let them explode out of hand alternatively it is symbolic of faith in yourself hope i've helped some  Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Consciousness Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Psychoanalysis Vulcan (Star Trek) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Scientology beliefs and practices Soul Bhagavad Gita Carl Jung Mantra Scenes from a Memory Force (Star Wars) A Course In Miracles Eastern Orthodox Church God Jon Secada Meaning of life Diving The Amber Spyglass Clinical depression Meditation Emotion Alcoholics Anonymous One Tree Hill (TV series) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Milton H.

why can't i lucid dream i first about lucid dreaming a long time ago but i never tried it but a couple months ago i looked it up so i did what it told me to do but i still can't maybe this will help throughout the day while you are awake ask yourself is this a dream anytime something odd happens or even when nothing out of the ordinary happens the trick is not to answer the question with an immediate of course i am not dreaming come up with a consistent way to check if you are awake or asleep for example checking the time on a clock and then quickly check it again if you are dreaming the time will always dramatically change at the second glance or if you are reading something look away and then read it again again if you dreaming when you look at it the second time whatever you are reading will be completely different as you keep asking yourself this question during the day the question will become second nature you will ask the question during your dreams and when you do your check to see if you are awake or asleep you are well on your way to lucidity identify your dream signals these are objects or images in your dream that serve as cues or markers to let you know that you are dreaming anything can be a dream signal and is unique to each individual dreamer it may help to read through your dream journal and select an images that seem to constantly appear in your dreams by selecting a recurring image then it has a better chance of appearing in your future dreams then when you are ready for bed tell yourself that when i see an apple then i know i am dreaming or whatever dream signal you have chosen use your dream signs to let you know that you are dreaming when an anomaly or something impossible occurs in your dream instead of ignoring it or trying to rationalize it let it be an indicator that you are dreaming some common dream signs include flying walking through walls or the appearance of someone who is dead in real life finally encourage your lucid dreams but do not force them as your efforts may have an opposite effect it is important to relax as you improve your lucid dreaming you can even learn to write your own dream scripts your sense of smell and touch will become heightened before going to bed tell yourself what you want to dream and what area you want to explore good luck  Dream Out-of-body experience Philosophical skepticism Sleep Carl Jung Phaedo Abortion debate Apollo 8 Plame affair The Amber Spyglass Philosophy of language Daredevil CPU cache Scientology beliefs and practices Scenes from a Memory Baseball Telepathy Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Betting (poker) Human sexual behavior Milton H.

is this a reincarnation dream or just a strange coincidence well i don't know if i can remember it that well it was about two years ago but i'll give it a shot in my dream it seemed as if i were a man which uh isn't right haha but i was watching myself like an outer body experience it starts with some very high powered man giving me a medal of honor then i head out to a submarine i was in uniform like i was a marine or something well right before the submarine went under i was looking out the window at the ocean and a very cold grey sky looked like iceland or something and i was walking to the bathroom just as we started our descent into the sea just as we were climbing down i looked into the mirror and my ears started hurting like a lot p here is where i woke up i woke up yelling crying feeling every emotion in the world i asked my mom later and her uncle died in the marines in a submarine sinking off the coast of iceland on my birthday exactly years ago reincarnation coincidence or communication ooh and my grand uncle got a purple heart award would this explain the medal i got in the beginning of the dream and nobody knew exactly how my grand uncle died could this be a form of communication and i never heard this story my mom doesn't talk about her family often and we don't talk to that side of the family i don't even know my grandma's names hahaha this very well could be a past life regression dream you should keep a dream journal and write down everything you dream about and the date we can learn a lot from our dreams just the energies you woke with suggest that this dream had strong significance for you i would say either a past life memory or a visit from you grand uncle you could have been him or one of his fellow sub mates on that fateful day very cool thanks for sharing that one  Scenes from a Memory Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) Pitaten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Miss Saigon Futurama (TV series - season 5) Jiddu Krishnamurti Plate tectonics Reincarnation W.I.T.C.H.

what does this dream mean i was flying around town in my body with the wind on my back and after seeing a thorough birds eye view of everything i was surrounded by floating lights in a dark area that's honestly what it felt like i could move my limbs and do math calculate time and know that i was in this dream thanks you've all confirmed my beliefs dream peacefully since a young child i have always had dreams about flying i've always wondered why my mom is very much into the new age spiritual thing and believes that the flying dreams was my spiritual self departing from my physical self for awhile and would go wandering that may be why i had the sudden falling feeling as i awoke from one of these dreams my spiritual self coming back with my physical self so you may have been expierencing an out of body expierence as far as the lights in the dark area not too sure i'd say other peoples spirituals selfs that were away from their body although i always saw people as a person never lights but everyone sees things differently  Out-of-body experience Scenes from a Memory Soul Emanuel Swedenborg Animism The Amber Spyglass Dream Philosophical skepticism The nature of God in Western theology W.I.T.C.H.

my dream i had i had a dream that i was stealing money out of the vending machine eg like 's why according to dreamcrowd the significance money has in your waking life is reflected in your dream state money is a symbol of power and wealth we often judge ourselves based on our ability to make it save it and spend it first consider your own relationship with money and your current financial situation as this dream could be simple wish fulfillment as always consider all of the accompanying details in your dream because they will help you to understand where your issues lie traditional dream interpretations indicate that losing money in your dream is a good omen and that probably the opposite will happen generally money may represent those things that are most valuable to you and not necessarily cash try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  Characters of The Sandman Labor theory of value Inflation Microeconomics Economics Monetary policy Meaning of life Deflation (economics) Wealth United States dollar Capitalism Money Anarchism and capitalism Politics of Canada Ten Commandments Insurance Gross domestic product Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Contract Simone Weil Personal finance Intellectual property A Course In Miracles Theory of conduct Hyperinflation Dream Tax Capital accumulation Vending machine Public policy Economy of Africa Model (economics) Economic inequality Wheel of Fortune FairTax Eastern Orthodox Church Goodness and value theory Baseball Stars Gold standard Say's law Power (sociology) Haibane Renmei Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Law of value Trade Keynesian economics Political economy Treaty Carl Jung Biblical inerrancy Social Security (United States) Supply-side economics Corporate governance Financial markets Carlos Castaneda Estoppel Monetarism Life insurance Separation of church and state Yoga Sutras of Patanjali End times Miss Saigon Diwali MoveOn Francis Light W.

why do i keep dreaming of the walking dead for the last about years i have had on and off dreams of trying to escape the living dead i guess it all started when i saw the movie return of the living dead but the dreams themselves are not about the movie just the idea of escaping these creatures i've since been fasinated by the idea and have even prepared myself for such a fantastic event but psycologically i have no idea what these dreams symbolize according to dreamcrowd to dream that you are walking with ease represents the way you are moving through life and progress toward your goals consider your destination to dream that you have difficulties walking indicates that you are reluctant and hesitant in proceeding forward in some situation you may also be trying to distance yourself from certain life experiences the difficulty in walking is a reflection of your current situation and the obstacles that you are experiencing to see the dead in your dream forewarns that you are being influenced by negative people and are hanging around the wrong crowd you may suffer material loss this dream may also be a way for you to resolve your feelings with those who have passed on if you dream of a person who has died a long time ago then it suggests that a current situation or relationship in you life resembles the quality of that deceased person the dream may depict how you need to let this situation or relationship die and end it to see and talk with your dead parents in your dreams represents your fears of losing them or your way of coping with the loss you may want that last opportunity to say your final good byes to them to see your dead sibling relative or friend alive in your dream indicates that you miss them and are trying to relive your old experiences you had with them in trying to keep up with the pace of your daily waking life you dreams may serve as your only outlet in coping and coming to terms with the loss of a loved one try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  Out-of-body experience Sigmund Freud Sant Thakar Singh Jean Grey The Amber Spyglass Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Supernatural Shaggy dog story Scenes from a Memory About a Boy The Lovely Bones Phaedo John Berryman Funeral Traumatic incident reduction Grief Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Narcissism Theodicy Enlargement of the European Union Current teachings of Prem Rawat The Pilgrim's Progress Immortality Carl Jung Clinical depression Paranoia Agent Dead Like Me Tonality James Hillman Karen Horney W.I.T.C.H.

what does my dream mean there is a girl that was my best friend since pre school since we were like years old we were best friends she came on to my husband around thanksgiving grabbing his crotch and tell him she wanted to give him a bj well he backed away from her and told me about it she admitted it and i decided she was def someone i didn't want to be friends with well times last week i had the same dream with the exact same details the general idea of the dream was that i found out she had died in a car accident and i felt so guilty that she died and we weren't friends anymore that i killed myself commiting suicide is something i'd never do especially over this girl why did i have this dream and what does it mean i've said this a thousand times before and i'll say it again dreams are sometimes used by our brains to expose emotions or feelings that you've been denying but feelings aren't concrete and dreams are visual so you're brain has to express these denied feelings visually and sometimes they turn out weird this one is very easy though it seems to me that you don't really want to let go of this friendship i'm sure you tell yourself that you want to let go but you're denying the feeling deep down inside the feeling that you want to forgive her and move on this doesn't necissarily mean you should forgive her it's just what you subconsciously think should happen i came to this conclusion because you felt guilty when she died if you had been happy that would have meant that you do truly hate her but instead you were sad even worse you went suicide this might have been becasue you ruined this friendship and you felt that the total time you were friends with her was a waste this doesn't necissarily mean that you want to kill yourself even if she did die like i said sometmes the expression of these emotions come out strange hope this helps  EastEnders Shaggy dog story Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Scenes from a Memory Futurama (TV series - season 5) Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sharon Tate Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Kodocha Marilyn Monroe Jean Grey Please Save My Earth Avenue Q Vernon Schillinger God Emperor of Dune Haibane Renmei Days of our Lives Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sin City Paranoia Agent W.I.T.C.H.

dreaming about exorcism i have this recurring dream more like a nightmare really i've been dreaming about it for years it started four or five years ago i don't dream about it every night just every now and then and it's different everytime except for these elements it's an exorcism sometimes i'd be the exorcist sometimes i'd be the assisting priest i'm not a priest in real life sometimes i'd be a person witnessing the exorcism it's always the catholic kind of exorcism i'm catholic by the way if that matters any it's always in my house sometimes i'd dream about my actual house sometimes the place would look different but for some reason i know it's my house sometimes i know the person who is possessed a friend or a relative sometimes an object is possessed sometimes a room in the house is possessed there's always a struggle between me and the spirit devil whatever you want to call it nope i don't watch a lot of horror movies because i really don't get scared they're nothing compared to these nightmares thank you very much for your responses i don't think i have a spirit in my house lol i've done a lot of research about exorcism facts and fiction and i've learn that bad spirits tend to inhabit places that are charged with ill feelings and negative energies i really don't put much stock in these things and the nightmare i've been having really doesn't bother me i guess i just want to figure out if this dream means anything or not exorcism to dream that you or others are being exorcised symbolizes your initiative to regain control and take steps toward the direction of your goals alternatively you may not be taking responsibility for your actions and are looking for a scapegoat  Exorcism The Exorcist III The Exorcist The Exorcism of Emily Rose Ghost Theory of conduct Scientology beliefs and practices Scenes from a Memory Avenue Q Horror film Characters of The Sandman Animism Holy water Opus Dei Devil Slayers Nine Inch Nails Lucid dreaming God Emperor of Dune Eucharist Demon Witchcraft The Nightmare Before Christmas Cyberspace Artificial consciousness Fictional character Baptism Evil Reiki Demonic possession K' Fatal Frame AFI 100 Years series Video nasty Philosophy of language Scapegoat Roman Catholic Church Clergy Pitaten Religion Holy Spirit Eastern Orthodox Church Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Alcoholics Anonymous Social psychology Shaggy dog story Electrophysiology The Shining (film) Post-traumatic stress disorder Daredevil Bad Wolf Exorcist II: The Heretic Anointing Miss Saigon Philosophical skepticism Baroque chess Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Traumatic incident reduction History of the English Bible Oh My Goddess!

last night i had a dream where i lost my car and couldn't find it again i dreamed i went to the mall parked my car did some mall walking and when i came out i couldn't find my car in the parking lot my dad came and helped me search the entire parking lot we concluded that it must have been stolen then the dream stopped what does that dream mean parking parking or trying to park a car in a dream suggests that it would be a significant time to start tapering off a relationship which no longer interests you robbery to dream of losing your valuables in a robbery is an omen of contrary and signifies unexpected gain loss this is generally a form of obstacle dream and its meaning must be related to the article lost and whether or not you found it if you lost something of great value the dream is warning you that if you try to be too sharp you can end up cutting yourself parents as a rule fathers represent authority and mothers symbolize love if the parent you dreamed of is dead and he she spoke to you you can expect to hear some important news otherwise a dream of your father forecasts progress in business professional or career matters i would need more details to give you a more accurate meaning of this dream but this is what i got from my book w what you provided i have used this book as a guideline for interpreting my dreams for going on years now and it has never steered me wrong sometimes i'll go down the wrong path anyhow and then realize later oh that's what that dream was trying to tell me listen to you gut instinct it's never wrong valerie  About a Boy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Plame affair W.I.T.C.H.

can anyone help me understand this dream i've had this dream times so this time i wrote it down so i would remember it clearly i went to a foreign country and got arrested for trying to help some poor children when i was released my family and friends gave me a huge dinner only old friends i don't see anymore and dead relatives were there at the same time my family and friends that i do see was waiting for me across town at another dinner i was torn between the sides but i stayed with the ones i never see anymore also when i was looking out of the window at the party i saw a huge snake lizard and an alligator that was under a bed trying to eat one of my sons each time it was a different son i was behind the glass so i couldn't save him but somebody at the party did please help i have no idea what this means and i keep having the same dream when i looked out the window there also was a fully cooked whole chicken floating in the pool i can try to help interprete some of it the fact that you are seeing your old friends and dead relatives is in indication of how you were and how you felt about yourself in the past while you were around these people your current friends represent you now you stayed with the ones you never see anymore because there is something in your past that you need to deal with or cant let go and the fact that you got arrested is an indication that something in your present past life perhaps a secret is holding you back or you feel trapped or held back by something that is going on now looking out the window is an indication of you looking at your life and you have a fear subconciously that your sons are in danger perhaps medical danger and you feel as though you would not be able to help them you feel powerless you want to be there to protect your children from everything bad that might come there way but you know that you cant always be there to protect them thats what the reptile under the bed trying to eat your son and you not being able to save them because you are behind a glass means but i believe there is something in your past that you cant let go of or refuse to let go of that will explain the first part of your dream  Jon Secada The Subtle Knife Shaggy dog story The Amber Spyglass The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Out-of-body experience W.I.T.C.H.

please interpret never had dreams like this last night i had a weird dream about being in this house and having to look after all these really tiny mice from these cats whilst trying to save one i kill some its really weird because i woke up after that and and fell asleep an hour later and that dream continued on with the same cats and being in some dimmly lit house with them then today i had a nap and the dream just continued what do the cats signify and is it normal for dreams to flow on from one another that doesn't usually happen so it sort of qualifies as a recurring dream i think elie was on the right track whether it's kids or a to do list you feel overwhelmed with your workload the mice represent your responsibilities whatever they are the cats just represent distractions from your responsibilities i think you're on the right track with the naps sounds like you could use some sleep get some  Sleep Dream Cat Narcolepsy Siesta Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Characters of The Sandman Philosophical skepticism "Weird Al" Yankovic The Amber Spyglass Shaggy dog story Charmed Lucid dreaming Out-of-body experience Phaedo Scenes from a Memory Avenue Q Futurama (TV series - season 5) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Secret of NIMH The Shining (film) Mouse (computing) Jam (TV series) Doraemon Cordelia Chase Miss Saigon Phantasms (TNG episode) Tiny Toon Adventures Pitaten Delayed sleep phase syndrome Mickey Mouse Fictional character Dean Koontz Sleep paralysis A Day in the Life Lights Out (radio show) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Dreamlands Insomnia King Crimson The Cat in the Hat Dream (DC Comics) Sonic the Hedgehog Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mulholland Drive (film) Prolog Red Dwarf The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Teacher's Pet (Disney) W.I.T.C.H.

what does it mean when you continue to have dreams about an ex i divorced my kids father almost years ago but i still have dreams about him it started out very frequent almost every other night i got to where i didn't want to go to sleep cause i knew he would be there and i would wake up thinking about him and the dream over the years the dreams have dwindled down to about once in a while but i still have them the strangest part is i have been happily married for years and have not had contact with my ex for years so why don't the dreams stop no matter how right a divorce is it's one of the saddest events of anyone's life especially as the years go buy and you realize this man you once loved knew you during the years when you were young and beautiful when the future held more possibilities and life's road was wide open dreaming of your ex in a sense is a way to dream once again about your young adulthood your heart is trying to see through the regrets and the pain again trying to find a reason why this love came to an end don't worry about it live your life in the present and your dreams will take care of the rest  Knots Landing Scenes from a Memory Miss Saigon One Tree Hill (TV series) The Amber Spyglass Marilyn Monroe Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart The Lovely Bones Futurama (TV series - season 5) Phaedo Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Theodicy Haven (TNG episode) Philosophical skepticism Cliff Richard Dream Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?

my husband won't sleep because of his bad dreams his dreams are really bothering him and i think he needs to figure out what's at the root of them so he can deal with it get some sleep he can't hardly tell if he is awake or dreaming in them either so they really freak him out he thought they were real like our house was haunted or something until i figured out that he was definitely asleep once he had a dream that someone was banging on our front door but no one was there he went back to bed in the dream and started relaxing and the banging happened again no one there again the other night he had a dream that someone was outside on our deck walking around jangling keys then they came around to the back into the back door slammed it and ran to our bedroom door like they were going to burst in but there was no one there he says he feels helpless in these dreams and since he started having them he wants to get a gun he's also heard about b e's in various parts of the country where the people were home i think he's anxious about becoming a father and i also think he s overly concerned about protecting me our future baby the dreams started around the time we found out i was pregnant it was planned also it might be related to his first son being taken away from his mother by the state being put up for adoption he tried to get custody but to no avail what do you think lol big reader huh crystal d yep i'd bet dollars to donuts that the pregnancy has everything to do with his dreams he's clearly anxious of course to me the obvious symbolism at work is that your child is banging on the door of your lives to come in maybe it's more about whatever problems your husband is having dealing with the coming kid if he was hurt badly by his previous child being taken away from him maybe part of him is afraid to invest too much love in this next child being afraid the same thing will happen again if you look at it that way then the intruder is the kid trying to get into your husband's heart he she the kid is looking for the keys that will let him her in the normal way but lacking that will go around to a back door like nightmares to be let in to your husband's heart and mind and recognized as a reality i don't think a gun will help really maybe the b es he heard about only inspired his subconscious to use that as a symbol to say something to him sound like that might be reasonable  Shaggy dog story Out-of-body experience EastEnders The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Scenes from a Memory Dream About a Boy W.I.T.C.H.

i had a dream my boyfriend cheated on me what can it mean i had a dream he came home with the obvious signs of cheating he tried to make it seem like it was no big deal and that it didnt even happen in the dream i started crying getting mad and was trying to leave him in the dream then i woke up my boyfriends never cheated before he's just not one of those scummy guys and he's away at work right now should i tell him about it and what do you think it means a dream is just a dream the most it can mean is that some part of you is worried that he might cheat one day doesn't have to have any basis in reality i also think it means that a part of you realizes how important he is to you and that scares you a bit because you are afraid of losing him don't mention it to him he might feel you are accusing him of something he hasn't even done chalk it up to a strange dream and forget it most dreams never come true i dreamt once that i was riding a pegasus winged horse however i've rarely been on a horse in my life even though i love horses doesn't mean i'll ever have a horse and definitely never will ride a winged one but it did indicate my own personal wishes it was still just a dream good luck  Avenue Q Milton H.

i have had various flying or floating dreams for as long as i can remember what could they mean when i was a kid i would dream of jumping off of high places and floating slowly to the ground when i got a bit older they evolved into me simply flying over a wide river with trees lining each side now the seem to have moved to me trying to practice flying you know learning to float and the controlling as ascent i remeber very few of my dreams but i remember these often enough to wonder what the deal is any ideas i guess my thought process is that the earlier two forms of the dream represent various levels of freedom the latest might be some subconscious attempt to try to regain some actual or perceived loss of freedom in my head that makes sense logically but i don t think dreams always follow a logical pattern yeah i'm with you on this one i've had mostly floating some flying dreams throughout my life and due to when i get them i feel they represent freer times in my life when i'm not bogged down with the weight of the world i agree though it's just a loose interpretation as there's no way of knowing for sure i have to admit also i used to wake up convinced truly convinced i could float and i really enjoyed the dreams  Philosophical skepticism Reality Dream The Amber Spyglass Unconscious mind Computer numbering formats Theory of conduct Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Central processing unit A Course In Miracles Aerial (dance move) Lucid dreaming Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Infantilism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Determinism Atheism The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Objectivist philosophy Consciousness Tenshinhan Scenes from a Memory Fundamentalism God Scientific method Logic Jon Secada Coercion Democracy Randomness Epistemology Immanuel Kant Carburetor Lindy Hop Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Free will CPU design Religion Existentialism Vegeta Phaedo Edgar Cayce The nature of God in Western theology Strategic management Object-oriented programming Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Milton H.

i've dreamed about spiders the past two night the first night i saw two average sized or not big spiders i saw one scurry in front of me and as i layed down i knew another one was going behind it i reached out my hand and caught it i felt disgusted as i felt it moving between my fingers trying to get away but i never got rid of it the second night i dreamed about several spiders they were everywhere in my home or the house i was living in and i was creeped out i did kill of them but one kept getting away i feared taking a shower or laying down my sister was in the dream also but she wasn't as creeped out as i was and she's terrified of spiders any ideas of what these mean i don't fear spiders i don't like them but who does i mean i won't ever have one as a pet if i see one in my house i will kill it but if i see one outside i'll leave it alone according to dreamcrowd some believe that the spider is symbolic of an unkind and sneaky individual are you the spider building a web or are you being dragged into one a spider's web might represent entanglement and the general complexities of life depending on the details of the dream it could also symbolize a smothering individual ironically very old dream interpretations say that the spider is an omen of good luck alternatively carl jung felt that the spider's web was a symbol of wholeness due to its formation circular shape construction and complexity he called circular symbols mandalas and said that they hold valuable meaning for the dreamer the spider and his web may be calling for an integration of the dream's personality leading to greater self awareness and resulting in feelings of completeness therefore the spider and his web may be considered profound and spiritual dream symbols that call for greater self understanding and encourage us to derive meaning and satisfaction from the intricate framework and interplay of life try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  Carl Jung Mandala Year of the Spider Psychoanalysis Milton H.

two way mirror imagine your on an old ship the ones back in the s and pirates were still around so i was a passenger on a ship destination unknown and i had had this dream once before i would peer out the window to see a pirate ship emerging from the water like potc headed for our ship the first dream i found a hatch and unlocked it and climbed in and stayed there until i woke up this time the hatch was occupied by a familiar face i proceeded to the rich peoples area to see the captain and some crew members around including an old lover i jumped into this closet and i noticed i could see out of the mirror yet no one could see me obviously some saw me go in there including my old lover a random lady opens the door saying something and by her face i could tell the pirates were on board and approaching i shut the door and noticed my old lover staring at me even though she couldn't see me she motioned for me to come here and as i opened the door the pirate man was there and iawoke according to dreamcrowd it is a symbol of vanity and superficiality you may be concerned about your image and the way you present yourself to the world some say that if you see a clear image you may be getting a glimpse of your true self broken mirrors always seem to be a sign of bad luck or at least represent some distortions on a deeper level the mirror can be considered to be a representation of the intellect the intellect is an instrument of navigation and is constantly persuading us to identify ourselves when we think about this it makes a lot of sense our self identity is very much connected to the way we look not only superficially but also characteristically as man woman young old etc we use this self identity which is greatly a production of our intellect to navigate through life try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  The Shining (film) Friedrich Schleiermacher K' The Amber Spyglass Navigation Fischer Random Chess The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March The Empty Child Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Battle of Jutland Side Characters (Xenosaga) Postmodernism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stewie Griffin Mercury 4 The Realm of the Elderlings/Characters Haven (TNG episode) Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword T'Pol The Dalek Invasion of Earth The Tomb of the Cybermen Link (Legend of Zelda) Colony in Space Yohoho!

do you think the same dream every night means something i've had the same dream every night for the past week that i die from a fire in my bedroom do dreams symbolize something else to dream of that you are being burned by fire indicates that your temper is getting out of control some issue or situation is burning you up inside most dreams contain messages that serve to teach us something about ourselves unfortunately many a times we forget what we dream about as we go about our daily routine with recurring dreams the message may be so important and or powerful that it just will not go away the frequent repetition of such dreams forces you to pay attention and confront the dream the dream is trying desperately to tell you something such dreams are often nightmarish or frightening in their content which also helps you to take notice and pay attention to them recurring dreams are quite common and are often triggered by a certain life situation or a problem that keeps coming back again and again these dreams may recur daily once a week or once a month but whatever the frequency there is little variation in the dream content itself it usually points to a personal weakness fear or your inability to cope with something in your life past or present the repetitive patterns in your dream can reveal some of the most valuable information on yourself it may point to a conflict situation or matter in your waking life that remains unresolved or unsettled or some urgent underlying message in your unconscious is demanding to be understood following are some tips in overcoming your recurring dreams in understanding your recurring dream you must be willing to accept some sort of change or undergo a transformation you must be willing to look within yourself and confront whatever you may find no matter how difficult it my be you must be able to look at the dream from an objective point of view try to get pass the emotional and reactive elements of the dream and get down to the symbolic images many times dreams are masked by elements that are disturbing preventing you to delve any deeper this is a defense mechanism that your unconscious may be putting up be patient do not get discourage if these dreams still recur even after you thought you have come to understand them learn to accept yourself truly and fully often times once you discover what your recurring dream is trying to tell you these dreams will change or altogether disappear  Dream Traumatic incident reduction Narcissism Psychoanalysis Carl Jung Karen Horney Autism Internet troll Clinical depression Consensus decision-making Narcolepsy Social psychology Epilepsy Deconstruction Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Scenes from a Memory Meaning of life Transsexuality Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Infantilism Unconscious mind Lucid dreaming Urinary incontinence Stuttering Miss Saigon Strategic management Futurama (TV series - season 5) Procrastination Cultural relativism Traumatic brain injury Children of Dune Milton H.

what does my dream mean i had a dream last night were my teeth fell out in crushed up pieces i was spitting it out which scared me what does it mean i have had dreams before where my teeth fall out but usually they fall out whole and one at a time so why now do i dreams my teeth are broken into tiny pieces dreams that your teeth are falling out are the most common dreams common dream scenarios include having your teeth crumbling in your hands or your teeth falling out one by one with just a light tap such dreams are not only horrifying and shocking but often leaves the dreamer with a lasting image of the dream so what does it mean one theory is that dreams about your teeth reflect your anxiety about your appearance and how others perceive you sadly we live in a world where good looks are valued highly and your teeth play an important role in conveying that image teeth are used in the game of flirtations whether it be a dazzling and gleaming smile or affectionate necking these dreams may stem from a fear of your sexual impotence or the consequences of getting old teeth are an important feature of our attractiveness and presentation to others everybody worries about how they appear to others caring about our appearance is natural and healthy another rationalization for these falling teeth dream may be rooted in your fear of being embarrassed or making a fool of yourself in some specific situation these dreams are an over exaggeration of your worries and anxiety teeth are used to bite tear chew and gnaw in this regard teeth represent power and the loss of teeth in your dream may be from a sense of powerlessness are you lacking power in some current situation perhaps you are having difficulties expressing yourself or getting your point across you feel frustrated when your voice is not being heard you may be experiencing feelings of inferiority and a lack of self confidence in some situation or relationship in your life this dream is an indication that you need to be more assertive and believe in the value of your own opinion in the latest research it has been shown that women in menopause have frequent dreams about teeth this may be related to getting older and or feeling unattractive and less feminine traditionally it was thought that dreaming that you did not have teeth represent malnutrition which may be applicable to some dreamers  Narcissism Dog Physical attractiveness Karen Horney Infantilism Baldness Carl Jung Homophobia Panic attack Procrastination Psychoanalysis Tooth Transsexuality Clinical depression Tonality Psychology of religion Stuttering Sigmund Freud Modernism Sleep Sexual orientation Philosophical skepticism Borderline personality disorder Methamphetamine Asperger syndrome Social rule Urinary incontinence Theodicy Second language acquisition Mad scientist Child sexuality Simone Weil Breastfeeding Anorexia nervosa Cocaine Hamster Yoga Sutras of Patanjali The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Gender role Prostate cancer Anger management Theory of conduct Leaf Drill bit Kim Possible Fathers' rights Characters in the Smurfs Milton H.

being chased in a dream there was many questions about this but not as specific as i wanted it ive recently had three dreams each one was different but had the same premise todays dream i seen a guy steal a car he saw me and started chasing me with a gun it felt like i was running in water so i couldnt get away when he finally caught me i woke up and another was me and of my friends were walking in a park at night a group of people starting chasing us my two friends took off running i tried to stay with them but i tired out and the group of people caught up with me when they caught me i woke up if anyone has had these kinda dreams let me know what ya think hi daniel i always start by reminding people that nobody can interpret your dreams better than you all i can do is to offer some ideas for you to consider and to see if they make sense in the context of your life first feel at ease generally nothing in a dream is what it really seems a gun is not a gun more later on that also keep in mind that anyone you meet in a dream is symbolic of some aspect of you the guy with a gun is you your friends are you the group of people chasing you probably represents you as well so where to start look at the dream in pieces i will just discuss the first dream because the elements in the second dream are so similar the car is a symbol for you in your daily physical life the fact there is someone stealing the car suggests negativity guilt or anxiety the gun is a strong symbol for sexual energy being chased by someone with a gun suggests a your are fearful of your own sexual energy water is a symbol for your emotional state you are running through it which suggests you are ignoring or not paying attention to your emotions so what does this all mean well i dunno lol but it may be that you are starting to deal with sexual issues that are causing you some anxiety and that anxiety is sapping your energy and these other elements of your personality are trying to get your attention to get you to pay attention and be less fearful the good news is that this is just a dream the dream cannot hurt you in fact it is meant to help you understand some issue that's an odd fact since the dream is so unclear but that's the way it works odd huh good luck  Psychoanalysis Out-of-body experience A Course In Miracles Scientology beliefs and practices Reparative therapy Transsexuality Sigmund Freud Self-harm Homophobia Meme Autism Child sexuality Sexual orientation Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind LiveJournal Gender role Empathy W.I.T.C.H.

i have a question when i was younger i used to have the same deam all the time it was kind of a nightmare but it wasnt from watching a scary movie or anything it was really weird and it was the same exact dream every time i had it which was kind of alot what is that supposed to mean tia berry umm well it was a dream that an old lady was going to cut my fingers off so i had to hide from her f sorry if u guys got all moody because i didnt say what the dream was about i figured u could just tell me what it means to have a reoccuring dream but whatever u want tell me my gosh what a terrible dream the good news is that the lady in the dream cannot really hurt you and in fact she is probably there to try to help you in some way sometimes nightmares happen because those are the dreams we remember fingers are a symbol for pinpointing a problem now you don't say if it is just one hand or both but having your fingers cut off would suggest giving up your power in some way that also causes you to make a less than positive choice the old lady is you so this is a dream about you trying to get your attention perhaps because there is something you are doing some direction you are taking which is sapping your energy does that make sense in connection to something going on in your life this is a powerful dream and if you can get at the root problem there will be great benefit to you good luck  Theory of conduct The Shining (film) Dualism (philosophy of mind) K' A Nightmare on Elm Street (series) Jeopardy! in culture Paul W.

my dreams predict events in my future i hardly ever remember my dreams but the dreams that i do remember seem to foreshadow a part of my life for example i dreamed a couple weeks ago that my ex boyfriend boyfriend at the time was hanging around his ex girlfriend again and it appeared to be true we actually broke up because of her my other dreams in the past that i've remembered have somehow predicted a future event to happen too so last night i had a dream that my ex and i were cuddling on my bed and talking again we've been broken up for a couple weeks and came to a decision that we were done for good but now that i had this dream it makes me wonder what's it mean and is it even possible for dreams to predict the future or is it just coincidence dreams usually reveal things in your life that you are already feeling chances are you subconsciouisly knew your now ex was not fully committed to the relationship your latest dream is no doubt your hopeful thinking that he will come back this will most likely result in you pursuing this and since he is a guy and probably not interested in any kind of real relationship will entertain the idea and get back with you at least until something else comes along it should be a warning that your personal feelings are getting in the way of rational thought it's certainly not a prophecy  Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) God Emperor of Dune Predestination Cliff Richard Jon Secada The Ashlee Simpson Show Philosophical skepticism Meaning of life Knots Landing Out-of-body experience Apocalypse Free will About a Boy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Lucid dreaming The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Book of Daniel Children of Dune Memento (film) Friends Pitaten The Invisibles Sin City S__ren Kierkegaard Sex and the City Dream Undergrads StarCraft: Uprising Time travel 24 (television) Neighbours Mulholland Drive (film) Law of value Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Phoebe Halliwell Time Out of Mind Miss Saigon Carl Jung Eschatology Sabbath Kodocha Spice Girls Spanish verbs End times Fiddler on the Roof D__j__ vu Badly Drawn Kitties T'Pol Kain (Legacy of Kain) Theodicy Theory of conduct W.I.T.C.H.

are there any foods you can eat before bed that will make you dream remembering your dreams is more about intentionality and habit than anything else keep a notebook by your bed and try to write your dreams or any fragments of dreams into them every morning after you wake when you first start these will be very fleeting and could be only things like a vague sense like scary or floating or colors smells or just images once you get out of bed and start doing things those dream fragments will pretty much disappear as you start to think about your day ahead so it's important to develop the habit of doing it as you start journaling your dreams they will get more detailed and you will start remembering them much better it will also help to think to yourself the night before i will remember my dreams by setting this intention beforehand you are giving yourself the mindset to remember them in the morning it really does help your mind hold onto the dreams in the morning sleeping pills alcohol and most drugs actually inhibit dreaming yes hallucinogenic drugs can create dreamlike states but these are not actually dreams per se physiologically they aren't the same  Out-of-body experience Lucid dreaming Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants Dream Diazepam Fitz Hugh Ludlow Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Narcolepsy Kurt Cobain Haibane Renmei Phoebe Buffay's songs The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct A Day in the Life Addiction Vomiting Philosophical skepticism Cannabis (drug) Avenue Q Neuro-linguistic programming Hubert Selby Jr. Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Rapid eye movement Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Skinny Dip Social rule Insomnia Folic acid Jon Secada Emanuel Swedenborg Urinary incontinence The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Philosophy of perception Patrick Star Fecal incontinence Psychosis Illegal drug trade Psychology of religion Oral contraceptive Daylight saving time The Shining (film) USS Seadragon (SS-194) W.I.T.C.H.

i keep dreaming about water ranges from large amounts of water to raging rivers and rainstorms according to dreamcrowd to see water in your dream symbolizes the meeting between your two states of mind the sand is symbolic of the rational and mental processes while the water signifies the irrational unsteady and emotional aspects of yourself it is a place of transition between the physical material and the spiritual to dream that you are on the beach and looking out toward the ocean indicates unknown and major changes that are occurring in your life consider the state of the ocean whether it is calm pleasant forbidding etc to dream that you are looking toward the water suggests that you are returning to what is familiar to you alternatively you may be adapting or accepting to the changes and circumstances in your life to dream that you are relaxing on a beach signifies that the coming weeks will be calm and tranquil for you your stress will be alleviated and you will find peace of mind to dream that you are working on the beach might signify a business project that will consume most of your time try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  Psychoanalysis Modernism Meditation Scientology beliefs and practices Consciousness Sigmund Freud Carl Jung Out-of-body experience Cognitive science Tai Chi Chuan Edgar Cayce A Course In Miracles Soul Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Dream Scientology Infantilism LSD Human Vulcan (Star Trek) Hinduism Buddhism Numerology Mantra Artificial consciousness Neurofeedback Music Alcoholics Anonymous Objectivist philosophy Baptism Aikido Phase (matter) Ecology Religion Trimurti The Fourth Way Lucid dreaming Book of Revelation Empathy Logic Meaning of life Beach Stoicism Emanuel Swedenborg Vegetarianism Hypoglycemia Narcissism Umbra (World of Darkness) Hypnosis Evolutionary creationism Miracle Stress (medicine) Nudism Urinary incontinence Consensus decision-making Simone Weil Spiritual evolution Therianthropy Combat stress reaction Silver Surfer Philosophy of mind Autism Cannabis (drug) Flag of India Art Shark Reiki Desert Traumatic incident reduction Young Earth creationism Idolatry in Christianity T'Pol Animism Sant Mat Vipassana Cool (African philosophy) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Creationism Sign (semiotics) Capitalism Hampton Roads Dualism (philosophy of mind) Insomnia Sathya Sai Baba Water Volcano Flood geology Sea level rise Postmodernity Laws of Form Glacier Royal Assent Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Max Weber Alexander Technique Bipolar disorder Church of Christ, Scientist

learning while lucid dreaming i was wondering if it is possible to learn to do things by practicing them in your lucid dreams for example one night while lucid dreaming i decided in my dream to practice screaming for heavy metal vocals i watched a dvd and soaked up alot of information and used the info i learned from the dvd in my lucid dream to practice it now before that day i couldnt even come close to screaming at all after that dream it was like i was able to i remembered right away how to position my head use my diaphram not my throat etc it was almost like it was second nature after just one night i have yet to be able to learn something new in my dreams again but does anyone know if there is a way to learn how to do this in your lucid dreams and how to have alot of lucid dreams whenever you want to also is there a way to have complete control over your lucid dreams like knowing that you want to drive a car really fast or jump off a building and being able to dream it thanks yes believe it or not thats one of the main reasons for lucid dreaming learing things practicing things in a safe and secure environment on a soul level other uses for the lucid dream are to work out issues in a safe environment or to explore the future past or current events thus presenting a prophetic dream what you did was get it exactly right in the dream then that boosted your confidence and gave you the feel for doing it in the waking state and yes you can control a dream completely it just takes a lot of practice and some people are better at it than others i for one an unable to do that completely but have consciously altered my dreams from time to time  Dream Out-of-body experience Scenes from a Memory Consciousness Dream Theater Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Carl Jung Sin City Milton H.

what does it means when one dreams about being able to fly it's like there is a wind and i just go with it and fly without fear it is a great sensation flying dreams fall under a category of dreams where you become aware that you are dreaming known as lucid dreaming many dreamers have described the ability to fly in their dreams as an exhilarating joyful and liberating experience if you are flying with ease and enjoying the scene and landscape below then it suggests that you are on top of a situation you have risen above something it may also mean that you have gained a different perspective on things flying dreams and the ability to control your flight is representative of your own personal sense of power having difficulties staying in flight indicates a lack of power in controlling your own circumstances you may be struggling to stay aloft and stay on course things like power lines trees or mountains may further obstruct your flight these barriers represent a particular obstacle or person who is standing in your way in your waking life you need to identify who or what is hindering you from moving forward if you are feeling fear when you are flying or that you feel that you are flying too high then it suggests that you are afraid of challenges and of success in reality we do not have the ability to fly thus such dreams may represent that which is beyond our physical limitations in your mind you can be anybody and do anything another way of interpreting flying dreams is that these dreams symbolize your strong mind and will you feel undefeatable and nobody can tell you what you cannot do and accomplish undoubtedly these dreams leave you a great sense of freedom good luck hope this helps  Dream Lucid dreaming Out-of-body experience Paragliding Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Autism Karen Horney Happiness Gliding A Course In Miracles Artificial consciousness Infantilism Umbra (World of Darkness) Carl Jung Psychoanalysis Alexander Technique Consciousness Numerology Scientology beliefs and practices First flying machine W.I.T.C.H.

i have vivid dreams in sequences like real happenings or movies how do i find out the meaning if there is no distinguishable symbol or theme am asking same q in mythology for instance i dreamed that my favorite band gave a concert in my childhood teen bedroom at one point the drummer was laying on the other twin bed beside the one i was sitting on afterwards we all sat on a couch talking i was between the singer on my left he holding my left hand between his two and guitarist on right leaning against me to hear conversation w singer after awhile i realized the guitarist had his hand on my right breast and as i realize this he leans in very close and asks am i hurting you needless to say he was not then i woke up nice but according to dreamcrowd to dream that you have or play a guitar represents passion and emotion it also relates to sexual connotations and may signal an erotic dream to see an unstrung or broken guitar signifies disappointments in love try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  Cliff Richard The Shining (film) Out-of-body experience Jon Secada Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story Scenes from a Memory Journey (band) Blonde on Blonde Guns N' Roses Nirvana (band) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Frank Zappa Good Charlotte Avenue Q Child sexuality Madonna (entertainer) Dream The Beach Boys Mulholland Drive (film) Pet Sounds Revolutionary Girl Utena Knots Landing W.I.T.C.H.

so latley these dreams i have had the weirdest dreams latly idk why a couple nights ago i had a drea i was captured along with like other people and we didn't see our family for like years it was weird and kinda sad does this mean somthing idk but some of them have to do with things during the day that i did like a movie i watched am i just weird according to dreamcrowd it is very common to dream about all kinds of faces strange faces and familiar faces alike are frequent images in our dreams interpret your dream by considering the face and the general content of the dream a stranger's face could represent different parts of your personality or psyche you think that you are seeing a stranger but in actuality you are seeing a different part of yourself jung said that the stranger is a part of you that comes from the unconscious a comic face may indicate that you have a conscious or unconscious need to mock or snub the conventional featureless faces suggest that you may feel unnoticed and unappreciated on the other hand some believe that the blank or unclear face represents a teacher that is someone who is there to show and teach you a lesson but you are unprepared for it and the face is blank smiling faces are representative of happy thoughts and feelings and possibly anticipation of a joyful event in the near future always remember the compensatory nature of dreams and their ability to point to the opposite of what you experience in daily life try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  Dream Carl Jung Consciousness Unconscious mind Past teachings of Prem Rawat Sigmund Freud Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Shaggy dog story Analytical psychology Current teachings of Prem Rawat James Hillman Meaning of life God Emperor of Dune Happiness Collective unconscious Lucid dreaming Free will Fictional character Psychoanalysis Characters of The Sandman Arthur Schopenhauer Karen Horney Alexander Technique Artificial consciousness Philosophical skepticism Near-death experience Oneiromancy Drama Theory of conduct Dean Koontz Eyes Wide Shut Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Jiddu Krishnamurti Poker jargon Mojave people Michel Henry Milton H.

nightmares dream interpretation murder any insight please i have had a strange dream last week and would like it interpreted if possible as it was very vivid and scary i have a dream book but it is not in there me and most of my family were walking down a street and down the bottom there is a hilly area my mum and sister were ahead and came back towards me saying there is a dead body down there i walk down and see a grassy area with a female dead body whose wrists are bound and she is on the ground in a foetal position faced away from me she has platinum short blonde hair and is naked she has a chemical poured over her body which i use as a scientist in my lab i phone the police but twice i couldnt get through finally i get through to someone and tell them my location i get a call back saying they cant locate me and where was i and to stay where i was my instincts tell me it is the killer i have no idea why and i am panicking to try and get out of there and tell my family we need to get out then i woke up well i havent seen a murder on tv recently i dont watch tv much anyway and i hate police or crime programmes yes it was vivid and scary as for the chemical it was potassium permanganate it wouldnt be on tv its a bleaching agent which may explain the whitish blonde hair and pale skin dream interpreter i did not see a killer in my dream as you have answered john m the first part make sense as for the second well i am a flirty confident person and attract male attention so this part doesnt make sense i would say that the dead girl in the foetal position is you putting away the last of your childhood but it's scary because whats in front of you ie your future is the unknown you are unsure how you want to move ahead is the job you have really what you want to be doing or do you want to do something else the nakedness is your vulnerability right now you are obviously intelligent you are a scientist but you have a lot of uncertainties are you thinking you need to move away from your family to progress possibly abroad if you go in this direction will you still be the same person and are you grown up and confident enough to handle a big leap forward not being able to contact the police is probably a feeling of not being able to talk to anyone else about this issue and the killer is your uncertainty you want to take your family with you but this is your leap forward not theirs if any of this rings true then make your move and go forward you will not regret it  EastEnders The Inside Joker (comics) Shaggy dog story Sin City The Shining (film) God Emperor of Dune Phoebe Halliwell The Lovely Bones Columbine High School massacre Serial killer W.I.T.C.H.

do dreams have any meaning specially if you dream that someone dies according to dreamcrowd to dream that you die in your dream symbolizes inner changes transformation self discovery and positive development that is happening within you or in your life although such a dreams may bring about feelings of fear and anxiety it is no cause for alarm and is often considered a positive symbol dreams of experiencing your own death usually means that big changes are ahead for you you are moving on to new beginnings and leaving the past behind these changes does not necessarily imply a negative turn of events metaphorically dying can be seen as an end or a termination to your old ways and habits so dying does not always mean a physical death but an ending of something on a negative note to dream that you die may represent involvement in deeply painful relationships or unhealthy destructive behaviors you may feeling depressed or feel strangled by a situation or person in your waking life perhaps your mind is preoccupied with someone who is terminally ill or dying alternatively you may be trying to get out of some obligation responsibility or other situation to see someone dying in your dream signifies that your feelings for that person are dead or that a significant change loss is occurring in your relationship with that person alternatively you may want to repress that aspect of yourself that is represented by the dying person try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  Sigmund Freud Clinical depression Homophobia Simone Weil Karen Horney Social psychology Psychoanalysis Out-of-body experience Infantilism Carl Jung Milton H.

a dream i kill someone i have made a strange nightmare last night my fellow platoon members me were resting when suddenly somebody we id as ennemy shoot at us everybody was looking at him and i was the only one to shoot at him but not with my regular service rifle but with an old bolt action rifle i shoot i shoot and shoot a third time to hit the head at close range then i woke up am i really going crazy just to add a little detail my regular service rifle is the fn fnc and i found myself in my dream with a lee enfield rifle i have one as collector's item a rifle used by the belgian army just at the end of wwii anameerf l can assure you that i am not waiting such opportunity it is not something i would do with joy but if needed i hope i will be up to the task i think that in this one the elements that stick out for me are the fact that you are the only one to stand and take action that you shoot with the old bolt action rifle and that you take multiple shots before the final close range kill shot i don't think you're going crazy but your subconscious is trying to work out some fears that you don't feel comfortable confronting consciously the fact that you're the only one to take action in this situation tells me that you're afraid that your fellow platoon members might let you down it's a reasonable fear the idea of standing alone in combat but realistically it won't happen like that this is just anxiety working its way out through your dreams you're shooting with your old bolt action rifle seems to have two possible meanings here on the one hand it could be anxiety in the sense that you feel like the weapons you have will let you down i'd go with this interpretation if your feelings about this weapon are that it's unreliable or somewhat negative in this interpretation it's more anxiety with the feeling that the weapons you're working with are going to let you down at the moment you need them alternative interpretation if you have strong positive feelings associated with the weapon then i would say that you have a connection with the past associated with your service in this case you are connecting with pride with the soldiers of the past and taking action with this rifle is giving you this sense of nobility and courage multiple shots and final close range shot to me indicates a sense of overkill i think we are looking at anxiety again and a fear that you will panic and the horror will get too close to you i think there are issues of anxiety fear a sense that perhaps you will have to deal with things without anyone to help you depending on the rifle this may be a mixed dream with also a sense of pride in your identity as a soldier this is common though to have a mixed dream they tend to be more confusing and nightmarish because they are not clear  M16 (rifle) Rifle Krag-J__rgensen Springfield 1903 rifle Sniper Platoon (film) Martial art Ammunition Out-of-body experience Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Mixed martial arts Internal ballistics Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Shaggy dog story Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Mosin-Nagant ISSF shooting events The Amber Spyglass Carbine StarCraft: Uprising Polish cavalry Jon Secada Unreal Milton H.

where can you get the meaning of dreams i keep havning the same dream over and over its not a bad dream but i am not sure what it means does anyone know where i can go on the web to interpret dreams some people believe that there are universal symbolic meaning in dreams but i'm not a proponent of this i think you could post them here and get multiple interpretations of them and you could get a more varied perspective there are many perspectives on interpreting dreams predictive psychological etc i tend to be fairly psychological in my dream interpretations for example other people tend to be very concrete others are more predictive etc looking at a broad spectrum of interpretations gives you a variety of dream interpretations to consider and some fresh perspectives personally i think the symbolic content is a mixed bag of some universal archetypes and more often a personal symbolic language if you really want accurate dream interpretation you're not going to get it from dream books and websites you're going to get it from interaction with a very good qualified analyst barring that someone with some good skills and study in jungian or freudian dream interpretation might be an excellent choice for psychological dream interpretation  Carl Jung Analytical psychology Social psychology Symbol Autism Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Predestination Psychology of religion Art Reality Sigmund Freud Jungian psychology Personality psychology Graphology Archetype Intelligence (trait) Asperger syndrome Eyes Wide Shut Transpersonal psychology Cognitive science Many-worlds interpretation Dream AQAL Logic Robert L.

can some one interprit my dream i was driving with both of my parents in the car and my father was falling asleep and we had almost crashed so me and my mother proceeded to yellat him and we did that and he woke up an then we kept driving and then this trailer skided and hit us and more people and we went off a bridge and we were in a tree and immediately i starteed looking for my mother searching that she would be ok she was next to me but my dad wasnt then i tried calling but i accidentaly dialed then we got off the tree with the help of some workers and there was this little dog walking around i dont remember what kind of dog it was i think a little beagle the end well last night i did eat like burritos and alot of hot sauce and i also watched harry potter and the order of the phoenix but yeah me and my father get along well in my religion it is a sin to not honour your father in the family relationship it seems to be just you and your parents and you perceive that your father is letting the family down falling asleep the driving symbolizes just getting on with life normal boring day to day living your father is in the driver's seat so he's the one that's in control of the situation but i think that you and your mother feel he's not paying attention falling asleep again and both of you find it hard to connect with your father which is why you are both yelling at him as he is falling asleep sometimes this yelling works because he wakes up and continues driving i think this part of the dream is symbolic of your perception of day to day living where you feel like you go along once in awhile screaming for attention your father in the driver's seat and not always paying attention and almost crashing the trailer skidding and hitting you and more people seems to symbolize a traumatic or disastrous event that will happen perhaps you forsee the path your family is heading on and that it might end badly and potentially hurt a lot of people you feel close to your mother because she was next to you and you begin searching for her there's still this sense that you are emotionally disconnected from your father because you're very aware that in this scary situation he wasn't next to you but your mother was you don't trust your capability to deal with the emergency situation because you dial the wrong number not finally you get down from the tree with the help of others i'm not sure about the dog because from the context of the dream i'm not sure where he appears at the end or throughout he could indicate a gentleness on your part or your tendency to get distracted overall i think you have this strong feeling of solidarity with your mother and worry that you will lose her or not be able to protect her if something traumatic happens in your family there's also a feeling that you are not able to communicate with your father as well as you would like and that he's in control of the family but perhaps not paying the best attention to where he's leading you that maybe your father should listen to what you and your mother need a bit better you're also worried about your own skill in dealing with stressful situations and whether you could do so successfully or not  Shaggy dog story Philosophical skepticism Milton H.

what to does this dream mean i have this dream where i'm running away from my family every time i'm the same place with them i'll be right next to them they won't see me i keep running from them what does that mean you have frustration with your family you feel that they don't pay enough attention to you the running can represent lots of different efforts on your part to make your family notice you you try this and that and they still put their attentions elsewhere the real problem is that your family already knows you are special they are already so impressed with you that they don't even notice when you do something extra special i'm sorry if this is little comfort just keep doing your best someone will notice you  Philosophical skepticism Jean Schmidt Paul Hackett Procrastination Dream 2000 Australian Grand Prix Mattress Sampling (music) Hal Trosky Jon Secada The Wall Lucid dreaming Social rule LiveJournal Don Rosa Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Barack Obama American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Poker jargon History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Real Love (song) Equine conformation Craps Alex Ferguson Apostrophe (mark) The Shining (film) American Idiot Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Betting (poker) Blackburn Rovers F.C.

i keep dreaming of wolves recently i used to have nightmares about them when i was young and now i'm beginning to have them again is there any meaning to this thanks sptool for getting that off your chest i suppose my question is as good a place as any for you to come out what dreaming about getting bitten to pieces by wolves has to do with your homosexuality is beyond me we all have personal symbols for things that mean something to us and it may that for you wolves represent some sort of threat what's happening in your life new job new college course big changes all these are a little daunting and you may feel threatened by these which is why the wolves are coming back for you the symbol of the wolf as a predator is important but also remember that wolves are creatures that live in packs they are very sociable they are fast they are clever you could learn to 'live' with the pack rather than run away from them just a thought  Gray Wolf Unreal Lucid dreaming Wolf's Rain Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Avenue Q The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Theory of conduct God Emperor of Dune Phoebe Halliwell Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Social rule Philosophical skepticism Undead (Discworld) Bad Wolf Boy Scouts of America Piccolo Junior Saga Father's Day (Doctor Who) The Amber Spyglass Blood II: The Chosen Dream Meaning of life Doom enemies Care Bears Beat generation Dog Characters of The Sandman Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The nature of God in Western theology Scenes from a Memory Miss Saigon Lycanthropy Apocalypse Yellowstone National Park Sin City W.I.T.C.H.

has this happened to you have you ever been like half asleep and you were dreaming and then when you're dreaming you feel this huge jerk and hear a loud noise and then you wake up it's so real but it's may just be the dream i've had it happen to me a few times and it happened to me today i was sleeping and i had a dream that my sister was driving the car and my mom was in the passenger seat and i was in the back my sister has her driver's permit so she drives me and my mom to church sometimes my sister was driving and she started driving up this hill that wasn't even a road there was just some trees i hardly remember what the whole place looked like but it was sorta like a place near my house but it was different and when my sister was driving up the hill there was a a noise like she hit something and i got jerked and i woke up rite then and in the dream it didn't even look like or seem like my sister hit anything it just was this noise and movement what could my dream mean and have you awaken from a dream this way according to dreamcrowd carl jung said that the wise old man is the archetype of the spirit and the speaking fountainhead of the soul dreaming about him may attempt to bring the dreamer into awareness of the larger meaning of ones life old people in dreams represent wisdom and maturity they may appear in our dreams at times of confusion and lack of direction or when we need consultation and help in decision making see also aging to see your sister in your dream symbolizes some aspect of your relationship with her whether it one of sibling rivalry caring protectiveness etc your sister may draw attention to your family role and sense of belonging it may also serve to remind you that someone in your waking life has characteristics similar to your sister alternatively your sister may be a metaphor and actually refer to a nun in this case she may represent spiritual issues if you do not have a sister and dream that you have one then it signifies some qualities that you need to activate or acknowledge within your own self pay attention to the actions and behavior of your dream sister try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  Out-of-body experience Dream Carl Jung Lucid dreaming Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Consciousness Simone Weil Roman Catholic Church Sleep W.I.T.C.H.

scary dreams i have been having some really strange dreams in which somebody is trying to kill me but each time i either escape or wake up each time it's in a different setting but similiarities in setting include it being a large building like a castle large house apartment building etc and there is always a large crowd there some of the people whom i know and some of whom i don't most often the dreams happen on sunday nights but not always and i have a thought it's anxiety for having to return to work the next day monday morning blues but i can't be sure anybody have some thoughts or similiar experiences dreams of being chased attacked or terrorized are always manifestations of anxiety you may be ignoring personal problems or simple fears in life your subconscious mind is simply trying to get you to accept these fears and anxieties knowing nothing about you personally it is impossible to diagnose anything specific however you do have the conscious ability to end the fearful dreams your emotional reaction to these dreams is to be afraid although many real world rules don't apply in dreams your emotions are different emotions are far more powerful than rational thoughts try this the next time you find yourself in a dream as described in your question ask the chaser or monster a question what do you want from me seems to be good enough you will find that a couple of things may happen first the monster will change into something less scary a hideous troll could become a pink bunny second the monster could disappear you would feel better and perhaps would have gained some insight which could travel back into your wakeful state personally i've had long conversations with my fear inducing dream characters i once had a dream that a giant was trying to crush me as i ran through a maze of stone corridors i stopped in the middle of a large room and turned to him why are you trying to kill me i asked it it immediately turned into my father and started to cry i can barely recall the conversation we had after that but it was incredibly emotional and led to me accepting things about my life the trick is that you have to be open to facing your fears  Anxiety Panic attack Lucid dreaming Dream The Amber Spyglass Out-of-body experience God Emperor of Dune Shaggy dog story Unconscious mind The Death Gate Cycle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Homophobia The Shining (film) Sigmund Freud Avenue Q Kain (Legacy of Kain) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Miss Saigon Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Social rule StarCraft: Uprising Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Psychoanalysis Stuttering Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Existentialism Jean Grey Traumatic incident reduction American Psycho Philosophical skepticism Scenes from a Memory The Hobbit Obsessive-compulsive disorder Piccolo Junior Saga Fable (video game) Transactional analysis Hypnosis RuneScape quests Paranoia Agent Alaga__sia Children of Dune Hulk (comics) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Stoicism The Fairly OddParents Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Borderline personality disorder Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Invisibles W.I.T.C.H.

inturitation needed my husband woke up this morning gasping this was his dream we were all in a small room at m' and m s wedding they were doing the handfasting ceremony but after the first three cords all their friends came up and tied more cords on but all the additional cords were black while that was going on i collapsed to the floor gasping for air trying to pull myself up on this arm chair which suddenly appeared though the cushion in the seat of the chair resembled a curled up human being for some reason everyone else in the room had disappeared and i was about to black out when i woke up any insight would be helpful some added information we attended m and m's wedding this past saturday there was a three cord handfasting in the ceremony he admitted to me before the wedding that he was uncomfortable about the up coming union that he felt slightly hypocritical going and giving his blessing when deep down he wasn't fully comfortable with their relationship to me it seems as though he is foreseeing someones future and that he feels a close tie to m and m and may end up being or feeling that he has caused what may be foretold in this dream the first cords are usually white or cold right scottish handfasting the rest seems to foretell of an impending death or close to death experience since it was your husband that had the dream more than likely he is tied to the male m in his dream the cords represent yrs of untroubled marriage the black cords foretell an ominous interuption in the marriage with the appearance of the human curled up as the chair cushion that may be the key if it was an adult i would say that something may happen to the man but if it is more child like i would be more inclined to say it could be that after children in the marriage that the additional children will not make it through maturity have him try to concentrate on the dream again before going to bed then try to remember more destinct details because really the information you have given is very limited and i can not discern if it is ominous to the couple or ominous to you and him or that even you all are even involved let me know more when you have re examined the details i hope you do not have any more bad dreams god bless  Marriage Handfasting Chair Strap-on dildo Same-sex marriage Scenes from a Memory Knots Landing Eastern Orthodox Church Milton H.

i keep having a bad dream my sister and i were both raped as children by our father i was six and she was ten i am now and she is our father is dead now he died when i was twelve but i keep having these dreams that he has us tied up and he is making us watch him rape our children i have a little boy thats seven and she has one thats two this is so tormenting it interupts my daily life i wake up in the middle of the night and i swear i can hear him walking in the next room i cant stop crying after i wake up so i cant go back to sleep first of all sorry to hear that you and your sister had that bad and unforgettable childhood that bad things left a bad trace of memory in your subconscious mind and the shadow of the rapping incident will be very hard to go away projecting your dad has you tied up in the dream show emotionally you cannot get over this shadow of shame in other words your dad was part of your life that is a fact and you can't deny it even though he died he used to be part of your life that stays in your memory forever there is something we can never get rid of family relationship is one of them now that your problem is not to understand the bad dream but is how to deal with it more or less you know why you dreamed about it whenever you look at children you will have that feeling back in your subconscious mind there are ways to get rid of it but it is very hard you have to learn to be tough and accept this is the fact first i would seek for spiritual help rather than psychological help in this case as christian myself i say faith to god is more important than anything else however if this is once in a while bad dream i don't think you should magnify the problem because you only get worse if this continues yes seek for spiritual help the temporary psychological help i would suggest that you talk this out with someone and let your feeling go in daily life and perhaps that will not come in your subconscious mind or dream  Infantilism Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Amber Spyglass Dream Unconscious mind About a Boy Miss Saigon Transactional analysis Carl Jung One Tree Hill (TV series) Night (book) The Shining (film) Immortality Sigmund Freud Lucid dreaming Alcoholics Anonymous Simone Weil Phoebe Halliwell Soul A Course In Miracles Traumatic incident reduction Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Avenue Q Theory of conduct Out-of-body experience Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ten Commandments K' Milton H.

i had a nightmare last night it was about my family and i living with this freaky roomate he hid weapons and corpses and torture devices everywhere and it looked to my family that he was a normal guy he tried to scare me a lot buy showing me where the freaky things were whenever my brother tried to go near him or his things i would take him away i told my family he was a satanist but he said he was a jew i ate unspicy chilli con carne with chips last night i have also seen a part of a copy of the ring tape online about a month ago and now i am afraid of the dark i don't want to tell my parents about the copy of the tape i saw i just want to get over it it's just a dumb video some nerd made to scare people i hope so what is this dream about is it what i ate because i heard that eating meat before bed gives you nightmares but i love chilli p s i don't mean the one from the movie that one wasn't really scary but the supposedly real one erm a copy of the supposedly real one i am cont'd horified and i din't even see the whole thing we all have had nightmares at various parts in our lives they are quite normal but what is exactly a nightmare and why do we have them nightmares are a subcategory of dreams the distinction of a nightmare is its frightening and or emotional content you tend to wake up in fear in the midst of a nightmare because of its frightening nature you tend to remember your nightmares and the vivid details they have a bigger impact upon your waking mind and its images stay with you throughout the day one reason for nightmares may be a way of our unconscious to get our attention about a situation or problem that you have been avoiding it is time to take notice and confront a problem or situation nightmares serve an important purpose in showing you what is troubling you from within you deeper levels discussing analyzing and understanding your nightmares can lead to a solution for some problem internal conflict or personal difficulty hope this helps a little and yes watching a scary movie or only part of it might stay on your mind for a while and lets you have nightmares it'll go away try to read something nice to get your mind set on something else before you go to sleep  Shaggy dog story Lucid dreaming Sin City Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Theory of conduct The Star Wars Holiday Special Out-of-body experience The Shining (film) A Course In Miracles Autism Insomnia Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Surveillance Milton H.

help decoding dream before i forget it i had a dream that was a new one there were trays of rings like in a jewlery store only they were locked in a safe the safe was large and the key was in the door then open to find smaller door with a key in it turn the key and open next door and so on then to find trays of rings but in the center of the safe was a box with the tiniest perfect diamond not set in a ring just a perfect stone i felt as though i was peaking and this was not my safe so i looked at them for a while and put them back then my dream changed into something else which i cannot remember all of but was kinda strange but the safe and rings were so clear i think this dream means that you are looking for something that is denied to you at present it could be an object ot a relatioship or a person i would say from the ringds that it i love or marriage you seek you feel there are obstacles to finding the perfection you desire and when you do eventually find it you either feel you are not worthy or are not allowed it for some reason it is someone elses but you look at it anyay as it is what you desire are you trapped in an unhappy relationshipthat you feel you obligated to stay in i hope you find your own precious jewel at some stage i m sure your dreams will let you know when you have  Lucid dreaming Jewellery Poker jargon The Amber Spyglass Changeroom Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) The Doors RISC Sento Mulholland Drive (film) The Shining (film) S__ren Kierkegaard Salad Fingers Saw II Tag Jumpstart 3rd Grade Shaggy dog story I Dream of Jeannie Eastern Orthodox Church Incarnations of Immortality One Ring Muslim ibn Aqeel Eggerland series Jon Secada Socrates Link (Legend of Zelda) Der Ring des Nibelungen The Death Gate Cycle Gollum The Curse of Fenric Dream Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Irish Crown Jewels Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Saruman The Dalek Invasion of Earth Mandarin (comics) Cliff Richard Spanish verbs Indian Round Table Conferences 1931-1933 Engagement ring Chaos Emerald Kurt Angle Shen Gong Wu Anchor Arthur Machen Gosei Sentai Dairanger Box Dial M for Murder The Hobbit Password The Three Musketeers W.I.T.C.H.

a strange dream hi last night i drempt that i was being chased by a rabit i was running away ans i thought to myself why am i running away so i stoped an turnd round and when i did it stoped an just sat there stareing at me i started moveing again but i just kept following me does anyway know what this might meen seems like something is going on in your life that is troubling or worrying you that you know is probably harmless symbolized by the rabbit you clearly know that running away from this is silly because you turn and confront the rabbit briefly and have a brief stare down with the animal this indicates that you have the awareness that your fears of the situation are probably baseless and that you are able to confront the situation and that you might have even done so in the past but for whatever reason you haven't dealt with the problem successfully and the problem is still with you i think there's something in your life harmless but probably annoying that you've been dealing with it may seem somewhat trivial soft and fluffy like a rabbit but it is bothering you in some way and you wonder why you're running from the problem instead of confronting it ask yourself if confronting the issue is something you want and need to do at this time and if it makes sense to do so make a plan and confront the issue  God Emperor of Dune Dream Miss Saigon Milton H.

what do my dreams mean i keep having dreams where i'm blush kissing guys that i'm friends with and don't like in that way in front a guy that i'm pretty certain has liked me for a while but has done nothing about it and i like him as well its always seems to be guys that we both know and i don't know what to think of these dreams since i seem to have them every once and a while i'm wondering if it's not a bit of foot stamping in your dream state if you know what i mean your subconscious is saying hey now to the guy that you like and think has liked you but hasn't done anything about it by showing off with guys you know are safe this is behavior some girls enact in their waking state trying to make guys jealous by flirting with safe guys in front of the guys they really want personally i think it's a nudge from your subconscious clearly these guys aren't going to make a move they probably like you but you know some guys are too shy to do anything if you're also shy you don't have to start kissing your male friends to get their attention try smiling and making eye contact with the guys you're interested in to encourage them to come over and say hi if you can get them to start talking you could probably encourage them to move a little faster  Milton H.

can someone please interpret my dream i was walking through a dark hallway of my dorms at school i hear someone say veni ad me latin for come to me i turn around and there is no one but the scenery changes to a creek that swam in when i was younger two people i never even met were skinny dipping and talking in german or what sounds like it i hear a yell above me and the sky is suddenly blackened out i cry out and fall to the ground i see a hand holding a knife with a hilt made of gold it starts moving towards me and then i woke up what does it mean thanks it's impossible for anyone to give a correct interpretation of this dream unless they know you well symbols in dreams don't come standard and generalized they are highly influenced by your association to the images and events in a dream you may be able to understand the dream yourself but it would depend on how deep an understanding of yourself you already have it would also rely heavily on the events thoughts and emotions you experienced the day before the dream wish i could help more but any interpretation of your dream by anyone on here would be a lot of hot air be well  Jon Secada Shaggy dog story The Amber Spyglass Columbine High School massacre The Shining (film) Scenes from a Memory Piccolo Junior Saga Out-of-body experience Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Milton H.

i dreamt that i was watching myself dig up and wash a corpse what does that mean looking for answers from the past and though you have to 'dig them up' you still have to work on 'cleaning' the memories so what you are looking for is clear to you the 'third party view' seeing yourself doing something means inability to take responsibility for some action we 'watch' ourselves do something that we wouldn't believe we could do has someone you cared about passed recently and if so were you able to say everything you wanted to say to them before they passed the scenario you presented also speaks to the need to 'resolve' something with someone who has passed this could be recently or some time ago  Haibane Renmei Consensus decision-making Opportunity rover Scientology beliefs and practices U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Transsexuality Philosophical skepticism Domain Name System Ted Kennedy Olduwan Past teachings of Prem Rawat Vlad III Dracula Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans Contract Divorce 50 First Dates John Kerr Global warming Theodicy Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Volleyball African American Vernacular English Eye Grammatical aspect Knots Landing Deluge (mythology) Jiddu Krishnamurti Surveillance Subjunctive mood Paul Martin Free will Shaggy dog story Fox hunting Spanish verbs Canadian Senate Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Page replacement algorithms 2004 Republican National Convention Scenes from a Memory Plame affair Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Global climate model Canadian House of Commons The Power of Nightmares ROC presidential election, 2004 Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Downing Street memo Democracy Martial art 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Australian constitutional crisis of 1975 John Berryman International law Democratic Party (United States) Urinary incontinence Social rule Reincarnation Origin belief Gaia Online Vicksburg Campaign Hillary Rodham Clinton Parliament of Canada Space opera in Scientology doctrine Scientology Miss Saigon Civilian control of the military Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Philosophy of mathematics Originalism Lawsuit Politics of Canada Archaeology Futurama (TV series - season 5) Consciousness Novel I Dream of Jeannie K' Burial Cindy Sheehan Too Short a Season (TNG episode) English grammar Futurama (TV series - season 2) Burma Campaign Blood Simple Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) U.S. presidential election, 2008 Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Timeline of the Universe Grandfather paradox Jeff Gannon Fermi paradox G-Man (Half-Life) Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Liberalism David Hume Datalore (TNG episode) Homestar Runner Unlawful combatant Battle of Kursk

do you believe that we live another life in our dreams and it is probably more realistic than this one i often have lucid dreams some say it is astral and for many years i have been watching how i there change progress i think i am not alone lucid dreams give us the ability to control our own dreams and steer them toward the direction we want in the lucid state we are more willing to confront threats and as a result become more self confident when we achieve lucidity we can use it as a tool to improve our sports game to rehearse a speech to fulfill our fantasies or to solve a problem in our waking life in fact some athletes utilize their lucid dreams to practice their tennis serve golf stroke or bat swing even in our day to day life we can use lucid dreams to ask the boss for a raise prepare for a first date overcome phobias get over writer's block etc the application of lucid dreams is limited only to your imagination lucid dreams can help us visualize and rehearse the event in our minds before it actually occurs because brain activity during the dream state is the same as during a real life event what you learn or practice in your lucid dream state can be seen as training and preparation for the real thing in the waking world our neuronal patterns are already being conditioned at least half of all adults have had at least one lucid dream in their lifetime many have reported having lucid dreams without even trying often flying is associated with lucid dreams however with practice lucid dreaming can be learned and can be achieved at your will  Lucid dreaming Dream Consciousness Out-of-body experience Alexander Technique Artificial consciousness Artificial neural network Neuro-linguistic programming Tennis Hypnosis Philosophy of mind Astral projection Neurofeedback Philosophy of perception Tiger Woods Electroencephalography Sigmund Freud Emanuel Swedenborg Meaning of life Urinary incontinence Autism Table tennis Brain-computer interface Cognitive science Paranoia Agent Dyslexia Stroke Golf Philosophy of language Volleyball Psychology Visual Basic Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Extreme Programming Multiple sclerosis Brain Narcolepsy Scientology beliefs and practices Jon Secada Stuttering Education in the People's Republic of China Ben Johnson (athlete) Ty Cobb Puberty Reality Avenue Q Car handling Social psychology Link (Legend of Zelda) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Direct realism Numerology Technology Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Aphasia James Hillman Baseball Adult attention-deficit disorder Human brain Quantum mind Connectionism Information warfare Parapsychology A Course In Miracles Progressive metal History of brain imaging 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Dualism (philosophy of mind) Unconscious mind Infantilism The Sims Victor Cousin The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Current teachings of Prem Rawat Bertrand Russell Microeconomics Martial art Theory of conduct Freddy Krueger Republic (dialogue) The Lovely Bones Hypnagogia Cephalic disorder Narcissism Lightsaber combat Randomness Simulated reality Kirby Computer and video game genres Blood (computer game) Sport Death Note Baseball Stars Doomsday argument Drama

really wierd dream ok in my dream i was at a doctors office and im just sitting in a chair then for no reason the doctor takes out this huge needle and stabs my finger ouch the wierd part is i could feel it and it hurt so much it made me wake up people say you cant feel pain in your dreams to use a needle in your dream indicates that you need to mend some relationship or situation that has gotten out of hand or driven to the extreme a needle is also symbolic of some emotional or physical pain to dream that someone is using a needle suggests that you need to incorporate and join together various aspects of your consciousness to dream that you are seeing the doctor denotes discouraging illness and strife amongst members of your family it may signal your need for emotional and spiritual healing to dream that you are in pain signifies that you are being too hard on yourself with regards to a situation that was out of your control it may also be a true reflection of real pain that exists somewhere in your body dreams can reveal and warn about health problems  Prostate cancer Hypnosis Simone Weil Pain Dualism (philosophy of mind) Meditation Dream Reflexology Domestic violence Out-of-body experience Tai Chi Chuan Medicine Empathy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Consciousness Church of Christ, Scientist Addiction Aikido Jon Secada Lucid dreaming Acupuncture Narcissism Shamanism Bene Gesserit Alexander Technique The Amber Spyglass Reiki Milton H.

i'm not a violent person but i had the most violent dream i find myself smiling all the time and i'm generally a happy person unless we put an animal to sleep iwork vets sure my family and i have small arguments about small things but we get over it i can't find anything to trigger this i had a dream i graduated highschool and went to college for no apparent reason i beat the crud out of this girl to the point where she had to go to the hospital i felt satisfied at hurting her and had an evil smile and as i walked back into the building the door next to me people were trying to shove a black horse through the door but it fought for it's life understandibly because even i knew that animals went in to be disected i wanted to turn and help it but as i turned to i woke up when i feel asleep i drempt i was a rainforestranger and i found a baby a mom dad tapir in the back of a poachertruck the poachers were small boys fully clad in hunting outfits with rifles they were smiling evil the whole time i was getting onto them and it additional details hours ago was making me furious i started picking up the boys and flinging them around angerly trying to get them to feel sorry for almost killing the tapirs but they continued to smile at me with this evil look of contentment i wanted to feel sorry for throwing them around and hurting them and i did but i was still angery they weren't crying and apologizing as u would think someone would i started hitting them so hard that the anger i felt woke me up i didn't go back to sleep and haven't had any violent dreams since that was about days ago i want to know what is wrong with me i've never even drawn myself to hit anyone in my life and these dreams frighten me of what might be lying underneith your mind is still processing what happened throughout the day we all have the potential for violence and in your case your brain works it out as you sleep it sounds like you feel you are being taken advantage of by someone lack of money on the job or feeling you are doing more than your fair share of the dirty work in any case just a wild guess just remember a dream's a dream and it's not reality and you will be fine  Shaggy dog story EastEnders Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Social rule Knots Landing Jon Secada Dream Lucid dreaming Pitaten Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct One Tree Hill (TV series) Avenue Q The Amber Spyglass Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Ranma __ characters Phoebe Buffay's songs Kodocha Futurama (TV series - season 5) Humphrey Bogart Philosophical skepticism Scenes from a Memory The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Jam (TV series) K' The Catcher in the Rye Anger management About a Boy The Marshall Mathers LP One Piece minor characters The Inside Narcolepsy Characters in the Smurfs Phaedo Time Out of Mind Joke Bob and George Friends Macbeth Cliff Richard YuYu Hakusho Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Escape from New York The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Miss Saigon Salad Fingers Tenshinhan Daredevil Socrates Milton H.

dream interpretations i've been having this nightmare lately it's always the same one it's always about the same person i never remember much when i wake up but here's what i do remember my guy friend lives very far away where he lives they have monsoon season which they are currently in the middle of i originally thought that i was having this nightmare because i hadn't heard from him in a while my mind naturally went to the worst thing i could think of so in my nightmare there is a monsoon where my friend lives he dies in it and my dream is very graphic other than that i don't remember anything else except how it makes me feel scared alone those feelings seem to stay with me throughout the entire day any idea what this means or at least how to get rid of my nightmare thanks your subconsience always tell you things that u really wouldn't think about in your waking life most likely it's your body's way of telling you that you should contact him because u r worried about him in one way or another so to get rid of them all u have to do is speak to him and make sure he's o k but your dreams could also be intuition too so keep a heads up and get in contact with him  Dream Lucid dreaming Jon Secada Theory of conduct Social rule The Shining (film) Philosophical skepticism Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story Miss Saigon One Tree Hill (TV series) Phaedo The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Unconscious mind Children of Dune Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Nightmares (Buffy episode) Socrates The Tale of the Body Thief Shen Gong Wu Oh My Goddess!

dreams nightmares i dont usually remeber my dreams but lately i have been having many dreams or should i say nightmares in the last week i had my first dream about someone dying my mom now i keep having dreams about other family members dying usually my dreams are just a dream about a day like activities i do anyone know what these death dreams mean or what could cause it thanks maybe recent frustration with your mother doesnt mean you subconsciously want her dead though the brain works in complex ways so at any point in time even when you're awake its hard to really say what dreams or conscious actions represent i would need more information as to the specifics of the dreams and your recent feelings actions thoughts etc to give you a clearer answer your mom could also be in trouble  Dream Unconscious mind Consciousness Sleep Scenes from a Memory Lucid dreaming Out-of-body experience Psychology of religion The Mother Wes Craven's New Nightmare Philosophy of mind Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Philosophy of perception Psychosis The Power of Nightmares Eric Cartman Existentialism Death Philosophical skepticism Sigmund Freud Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne Oneiromancy Nightmares (Buffy episode) Artificial consciousness Green Goblin Electroencephalography Kurt Cobain Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Astral projection Treehouse of Horror V Nightmare (Soul Calibur) Jean Grey Narcolepsy Free will Brain Phantasms (TNG episode) Phoebe Buffay's songs The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Doug The Catcher in the Rye Philip K.

really weird dream want to know what it means ok i had a dream that i was a mermaid who wanted to go to live on land so when i did i was caught by an older lady and she put me to court and i kept on blowing my cover like my fins were peeking out of my skirt and when i opened the water it was squirting into a waterfall and i was turning into a sea creature i felt really lonely and i just remember wanting to go back to the sea then i woke up and fell back asleep and had another dream that i was at a grocery store with my friend and we saw this really cute register guy and we were so excited but he didnt like us back and we were getting a poster of him and then we found out that the poster was stolen so we had to give it back the peculiar thing about this dream was that everything was dark and dreary like this horror movie like there were clouds and everything was empty except cars i really wanna know what this means according to dreamcrowd to see water in your dream symbolizes the meeting between your two states of mind the sand is symbolic of the rational and mental processes while the water signifies the irrational unsteady and emotional aspects of yourself it is a place of transition between the physical material and the spiritual to dream that you are on the beach and looking out toward the ocean indicates unknown and major changes that are occurring in your life consider the state of the ocean whether it is calm pleasant forbidding etc to dream that you are looking toward the water suggests that you are returning to what is familiar to you alternatively you may be adapting or accepting to the changes and circumstances in your life to dream that you are relaxing on a beach signifies that the coming weeks will be calm and tranquil for you your stress will be alleviated and you will find peace of mind to dream that you are working on the beach might signify a business project that will consume most of your time try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  The Amber Spyglass The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Psychoanalysis Lucid dreaming Dream Jon Secada Modernism Characters of The Sandman Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Sigmund Freud Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Consciousness Futurama (TV series - season 2) A Course In Miracles Soul One Piece minor characters Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Shaggy dog story Force (Star Wars) Scientology beliefs and practices Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Characters in the Smurfs Meditation Edgar Cayce Waking the Dragons Cognitive science Mantra Hypnosis Infantilism Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shark Artificial consciousness Changeling: The Dreaming Opportunity rover The Little Mermaid (film) Obi-Wan Kenobi God Emperor of Dune Cannabis (drug) Book of Revelation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Alcoholics Anonymous Ten Commandments Marilyn Monroe Avenue Q Social rule Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch Clinical depression Human Autism Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi Urinary incontinence The Invisibles Scientology Objectivist philosophy Sant Thakar Singh Funeral W.I.T.C.H.

writing down dreams when someone is trying to get good at remembering their dreams they are supposed to kkep a dream journal or sumthing like that but is their another way to do it such as just going through the dream in your head would it be as effective remembering your dreams will require some effort on your part but what your dreams can offer and tell you about yourself will be well worth it here are some tips in helping your dream recall before going to bed keep a clear mind tell yourself that i will remember my dream when i wake up this is actually a proven and effective way to help dream recall having too many thoughts on your mind can distract you from remembering your dream in the morning have a regular bedtime and wake up time make this your routine going to bed and waking up at a regular time every day aids in dream recollection avoid alcohol consumption and taking medication before going to bed these things may hinder you from remembering your dream eating fatty foods too close to bedtime can also divert bodily resources away from the brain and hinder dream recollection keep a pencil notebook or tape recorder next to your bed so that it will be within reach as soon as you wake up you want to make recording your dreams as easy a task as possible having a small lamp by your bedside is also a good idea should you wake up in the middle of the night and want to record your dream immediately do not get out of bed immediately upon waking from a dream lay still in your bed keeping your eyes closed and moving as little as possible wake up slowly and stay relax hold on to the feelings you have and let your mind wander to the images of what you have just dreamt were you frustrated terrified or happy write down as many details in your dream as you can no matter how minute or seemingly unimportant it may be do not judge the content or worry if it makes sense the idea is to get it down on paper so you can evaluate it later make it a habit that this is the first thing you do talking about your dreams to friends or participating in forums and chats also help you remember sometimes it may help to draw pictures a picture is worth a thousand words as the saying goes even if you are not an artist a simple drawing can help to jolt details of your dream  Lucid dreaming Out-of-body experience Phaedo Social rule Milton H.

what would happen if i took a few pain pills before i knew i was pregnant i'm aware that women shouldn't take certain drugs while pregnant but i'm not qualified to know what they are your best bet is to talk to your gynecologist he or she would be able to tell you whether the pain pills would have any effect on the growing fetus and also during what stage of pregnancy such effects might be more pronounced good luck  Pregnancy Ectopic pregnancy Emergency contraception Oral contraceptive Folic acid Abortion debate Endometriosis Miscarriage Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Obstetrics Intrauterine device Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Birth control Psoriasis Caffeine Chemical abortion Twin Gynaecology Abortion Acne Breastfeeding Childbirth Teenage pregnancy Depo Provera Religion and abortion Pelvic inflammatory disease Roe v.

can anyone help me with this dream meaning well about half hour ago i had a dream that i found my boyfriend under my bosses desk wih some naked blonde chick they had just had sex and he was laughing and cuddling up with her i kept telling eveyone look see what is going on and no onecared then i find myself out in the rain somewhere like ye olde world type thing contemplating life when this man trys o sell me smoothies and other drink from his stall anyone that can help with a serious answer for this dream meaning would be much appreciated xxx sighs i usually don't respond to dreams like this one just because the main issue of the dream is usually apparent but you seemed like you wanted some opinions input and perhaps a little consolation as well it's a trust issue subconciously or even consciously there are trust issues in your relationship with your boyfriend dreaming of your partner having an affair or cheating on you usually depicts that there are very strong unresolved issues with distrust in the relationship this could be on your part or on his has he ever cheated on you during the time you were together does he flirt a lot with other women either when your are or are not with him if neither of those things are true do you feel like he doesnt spend enough time with you or pay attention to you this could be the reason that you dreamt of him 'compromised' with the woman in the dream why that type of woman i e in reference to the 'act' of sexual relations in the dream or with that colour hair it couldve been any does he tend to like blonde women or do you feel like perhaps he favours blonde women over women with darker hair do you feel inferior to women with blonde hair in the sense of comparing your beauty to that of someone with blonde hair these may not even be relevant conclusions yet they are questions you should ask yourself as women we often compare ourselves with other women we may admire the beauty we see in others and compare oursleves to them thinking ourselves less beautiful and appealing for a number of reasons this is our nature but this is not true every woman is beautiful in her own way i think we each need to realise this as we as women are all guilty of comparing ourselves to each other wanting to be like that which we think or believe is beautiful it takes more confidence in yourself and a realisation of your own personal beauty inside and out for which he fell in love with you in the first place the fact that you dreamt him laughing about it after he got caught by you this again could be the trust issue or could be revealing of his personality if you have had issues in the past with him cheating on you in real life this i believe is relevant as indicated by the next part of you dreaming of being in the 'ye olde world type thing' as that is representavie and symbollic of your past perhaps your past with him in terms of the realtionship you were contemplating life you were out in the rain somewhere rain can be symbollic of a refreshing or a cleansing but that depends on the context and setting of the dream as in the particulars of this dream what was emoted by you as you were standing out in the rain i see it more as symbollic of you feeling lonely and isolated perhpas in this relationship and even perhaps so far back as when it first began which would seem to fit in with the context of you dreaming of the past i e olde world the part about the smoothies and drinking from his stall i havent any sense on except maybe it indicates a self comforting or self medicating in a way in the sense of or along the same lines as does a drink at the bar after a really bad day at work act as a kind of therapy for our emotions perhaps this is representative of bringing health to you in terms of choosing healthy relationships as smoothies are healthy but i dont know i think that's a stretch in any case i'd say that for your relationship with him your boyfriend to go on the two of you need to bridge that gap of communication and quality time that is causing this major trust issue in the relationship as without trust and communication even the most hand picked of relationships will fail if he is the kind that is a philander at heart then you need to have the confidence to end the relationship knowing that you can do better as any man that cannot be faithful is no man at all and not worth your time this is just my opinion take it with a grain of salt  EastEnders Social rule Sexual orientation Infantilism One Tree Hill (TV series) Human sexual behavior Abortion debate Blonde on Blonde Simone Weil Child sexuality Transsexuality Dead Like Me Sin City W.I.T.C.H.

is it posible to dream what you want to dream is there any way to control what you dream at night i'm just curious what do you have to do to control it you can dream about what you want doing it takes some concentration but it's not as hard as you might think after your finally comfortable and as you try to sleep and your mind fills with thoughts imagine a scene and play it out in your head focusing on the scene as coherently as you can creating details dialogs and action but driving the scene forward while not playing to much with the overall story of the dream you want if you do this right the scene in your mind becomes the dream and moves on it's own from there this is also a great way to drop to rem sleep really fast which is good for power naps controlling dreams is the holy grail of dreaming keeping in your mind that you want to lucid dream when you go to sleep is a start but the trick is to figure out that your dreaming without waking up usually something non sensical that could only happen in a dream will be the trigger trying to forcefully control a dream usually ends up in waking up but nudging the dream and trying to only apply small changes and shifts can keep you in control but still dreaming lucid dreaming is hard don't be discourage if it takes a while to have a good experience with it  Lucid dreaming Dream Narcolepsy Hypnosis Insomnia Parsifal Consciousness Sleep paralysis Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind W.

i have not dreamed of my tower in a long time why is this i used to dream about a place that was surrounded by the hood a bad hood but once there it was a building with a tree growing in it with unlimited levels bottom floor was where everyone got there food first then huge massive elevators people in harmony floors were for learning or for games like gambling according to dreamcrowd the tree in your dream is you the health size and overall quality of the tree is indicative of how you feel about yourself this interpretation is to be made only when the tree is the focal point of the dream also consider whether the tree is alive with leaves flowers or fruit or if it's barren you may see trees in your dream as a part of a landscape or as a secondary symbol at those times consider all of the details as they may have different interpretations than the one just given food like eating is a powerful image foods may be scenery or may be central images in the dream who prepared the food can also be an important detail to understanding what it means for example if there is a bowl of potato salad like aunt sally used to make and she has been dead for two years aunt sally or her personal influence may be important to dream insights br br excessive amounts of food may herald fertility gluttony or wealth how did the excessive food get into the dream and how did people in the dream react to its presence it may be that you or others have divergent views of what constitutes excess or gluttony provision and fertility often go hand in hand you may dream of needing more food than another because you believe you have additional responsibilities it may be that the food was acquired simply because the means existed to acquire it this can mean wealth or benevolence depending on what becomes of the food br br fresh food may be a sign of renewal this can present itself as needing to get fresh food take a sabbatical having fresh food feeling as though this is a renewing place you're dreaming of or harvesting being in touch with nature or feeling proud of work you've accomplished br br spoiled food is a sign of waste excess gluttony or mismanagement these dreams often carry a sense of repulsion for the loss order or appearance of the food have you ever struggled with your weight food as a comforter or an eating disorder such as bulimia or anorexia br br were you put in uncomfortable positions because of food and others forcing you to eat unwanted items or unsatisfactory quantities do the foods in the dream correspond to significant persons in any of these emotional transactions try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  Anorexia nervosa Japanese tea ceremony Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Supply and demand Potato Organic farming Hypoglycemia Dieting Bulimia nervosa Food Gravity Microeconomics Nutrition Force (Star Wars) Animism Human Kashrut Atkins Nutritional Approach Breastfeeding Eating disorder Hamster Tonality Coeliac disease Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pysanka Veganism Obesity Wealth Famine Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Apple Species Philosophy of language Fancy rat Fast food Dairy Second language acquisition Meaning of life Vomiting Funeral Foodborne illness Domestic rabbit Motivation Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Fire fighting Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Dream Narcissism Capitalism RuneScape skills Green Revolution Cuisine of Malaysia Aikido Friedrich Schleiermacher Characters of The Sandman Olive oil Internet troll Flowering plant 613 mitzvot Keynesian economics Androgen insensitivity syndrome Autism Binge eating disorder Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Traumatic incident reduction Local food Economy of Nigeria Alcohol fuel Adjustable gastric band Hyperglycemia Poker jargon Birth control Mango Hunting Mahjong Surplus product Chinese language Acorn Biodiesel Asperger syndrome Breakfast Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Clinical depression Jewish cuisine Guinea pig Livestock Cuisine of Denmark Explosive material Cognitive science Vitamin C Abortion debate

family oriented dream i had a baby it stayed in mom and dad's room and slept on their dresser on a couple of paper towels it was a real make shift habitat for the baby but it really seemed to enjoy it's sleeping arrangment because every time it was lyed down it gave a big grin before falling asleep i loved the little baby and wanted it to stay in my room with me but mom thought it was better for her to look after it but she was pleased with my willingness to care for it sometime in the dream my sperm doner whom i've not seen since i was about came to see the family and rob us he was threatening to kill the family when he heard the baby he asked what it was and i told him it was his only descended female whatever that means he held it for a very long time and offered to leave the family alone if i let him take the baby i knew it would've been a horrible way for the baby to be raised put against my family being killed i let him take my baby that he was so endeared with and felt very sad on a note i don't have a baby nor do i have any urge or plans to conceive one just so there's no confusion baby to see a baby in your dream signifies innocence warmth and new beginnings babies may symbolize something in your own inner nature which is pure vulnerable and or uncorrupted if you dream that you are on your way to the hospital to have a baby then it signifies your issues of dependency and your desire to be completely care for perhaps you are trying to get out of some responsibility babies may represent an aspect of yourself that is vulnerable and helpless if you dream that you forgot you had a baby then it suggests that you are trying hide your own vulnerabilities you do not want to let others know of your weaknesses if you are pregnant then a more direct interpretation may simply mean that you are experiencing some anxieties of making it to the hospital when the time comes to dream of a crying baby is indicative of a part of yourself that is deprived of attention and needs some nurturing alternatively it represents your unfulfilled goals and a sense of lacking in your life to see a dead baby in your dream symbolizes the ending of something that is part of you to dream about a starving baby represents your dependence on others you are experiencing some deficiency in your life that needs immediate attention and gratification having a baby to dream that you or someone is having a baby suggests that you are giving birth to a new idea or project it also represents new beginnings or some upcoming event a more direct interpretation of this dream may represent your desires anxieties of giving birth or the anticipation for such an event to occur robbery to dream that you have been robbed denotes that you are experiencing an identity crisis or you are suffering some sort of loss in your life alternatively you may feel that someone has stolen your success or has taken credit for something you did  EastEnders Narcissism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knots Landing Abortion debate Infantilism Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Out-of-body experience Simone Weil Scenes from a Memory Dream Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Phoebe Halliwell Adoption T'Pol Jon Secada History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Alois Hitler The Amber Spyglass Fernando Pessoa Birth control Clinical depression Sharon Tate Philosophical skepticism Childbirth Miss Saigon Urinary incontinence Days of our Lives Friends Pitaten Hypoglycemia Pregnancy W.I.T.C.H.

liquid dreams i have these dream occasionaly can someone tell of how to get ties all the time i think there cool unless you are referring to wet dreams i think the word you are looking for is lucid these are no easy thing to do took me years to become master of my domain hardest part about a lucid dream is knowing when it is a dream if you suspect you are dreaming just ask if it sounds silly to you then most likely you are awake and the people laughing at you are real just remember people in your dream will react the way you think they will react if you ask if this is a dream it is likely they will laugh at you or deny it other way to tell if it is a dream is if you can do something you normally can't do fly survive a huge fall by the way when i fall off a cliff in a lucid dream i climb or fly back up and jump off again for fun or survive anything you wouldn't normally survive breath underwater don't fight it beat the crude out of zombies or other mythical creatures you have to make yourself aware of fall asleep the night you want a lucid dream have a routine before bed i find that on nights that i don't follow a routine are the ones that i have normal dreams but over all force yourself to become a wear of the dream other tips watch less tv sadly tv does little to inspire a lucid dream it inspires watching a dream those dreams can be fun but i much rather have full control read more this can have a strange effect the way i see it you accomplished a lucid dream if you can read what is in it not saying it will make any sense but it will sound important at the time perform in plays i did plays nothing big improved plays as well you would be surprised how much this helps biggest tip write write write short stories novels hell write your perfect idea of a dream journals anything creative creative writing will inspire creative dreaming i once wrote out my dream garden and three nights later i dreamed about it kicked some major zombie butt in it to honestly don't know why i dream of beating up zombies but it's fun video games play more just do it you know you want to but stragtic games will help you to feel more in control play them before bed in you will have more control disclaimer results may vary  Lucid dreaming Dream Out-of-body experience Spidey Super Stories Super Mario 64 The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Consciousness Dream Theater Diving The Amber Spyglass Philosophical skepticism Avenue Q Theory of conduct Social rule Aerial (dance move) Tag Jon Secada Shaggy dog story One Piece minor characters Futurama (TV series - season 5) Paul W.

help me with this dream ok my mom had a dream and she told me my dad was stabbing her on the bed in her hands and her chest constently idk it freaked her out so whats it mean death dreams about death are not necessarily bad omens but they usually represent anxious or angry feelings to dream of your own death is actually positive it means renewal and letting go of an old stage of life this is also a common dream when you are getting over an illness and it's a good sign that you are getting better however if you dream that you are dying slowly you need to drastically change your routine and reenergize your life to dream about the death of a loved one suggests that you are lacking a certain quality that the loved one represents  Avenue Q Parsifal Teen Girl Squad Lucid dreaming Grandview, U.S.A.

what does it mean when you've been dreaming of sexual encounters with random people i'm not a very sexually active person but these dreams seem to be occuring more and more often they are so real to the point where i can feel what's happening sex to dream about sex may be your libido's way of telling you that it's been too long since you have had sex it may indicate repressed sexual desires and your needs for physical and emotional love to dream about sex with someone other than your spouse or significant other suggests dissatisfaction with the physical side of your relationship on the other hand it may be harmless fantasy in such situations you may find that you are less inhibited sexually and you can even bring that sense of adventure to your existing relationship to dream that you are having sex with an ex or something that is not your current mate denotes your reservations about embarking in a new relationship or situation you may feel nervous about exposing yourself or currently feel a resurgence of those old emotions and feelings that you felt back when you and your ex were together believe it or not it is not uncommon for people approaching their wedding to experience especially erotic adventures with partners other than their intended spouses this may be due to the intensity of your sexual passion with your fianc it also relates to the new roles that you will be taking on and the uncertainty that that may bring sexuality to dream about your own sexuality signifies the secrets and meaning of life you may be dealing with life issues of birth marriage and or death alternatively it suggests that you are concerned about losing your sex appeal  Human sexual behavior Sexual orientation Child sexuality Infantilism Narcissism Polyamory Sadism and masochism Domination & submission (BDSM) Cybersex Zoophilia Love Sexual abstinence BDSM Marriage Human sexuality Homophobia Same-sex marriage Bondage (BDSM) Transsexuality Sigmund Freud Phone sex Psychoanalysis Motion picture rating system Inhibited sexual desire Domestic violence Transgender Carl Jung Andrea Dworkin Homosexuality Grief Puberty Sex God Emperor of Dune Friendship Child sexual abuse Bisexuality Homosexuality and transgender History of sex Polygamy Paraphilia Statutory rape Heterosexuality Incest Gender role Sex education Asexuality The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Vulcan (Star Trek) Motivation Monogamy Abortion debate S__ren Kierkegaard One Tree Hill (TV series) Gender Rape Sexual revolution Premature ejaculation Gender identity disorder Orgasm Dead Like Me Childlove movement Same-sex marriage in Canada Anal sex Sex and the City Birth control Slash fiction Homosexuality and Christianity Data (Star Trek) Borderline personality disorder Lawrence v.

i had a dream of a solar eclipse what does it mean this was my dream i was in a pool with many people at night in the darkness then the sun comes up but there is just a red glow surrounded by darkness i look up then the moon comes up and spins upwards to the back of the sun then a great expolsion of red energy bursts this lasted for about seconds what does it mean to dream of an eclipse of the sun indicates self doubt and fears of not achieving your goals you are underestimating your abilities and losing your confidence you may be undergoing some difficult times and unable to remain optimistic to dream of an eclipse of the moon signifies that some hidden aspect of yourself is coming to the surface now to get more into it it's probably a good idea to get the definitions for other symbols in your dream such as pool people darkness color red moon and sun pool to see a pool of water in your dream indicates that you need to understand and deal with your emotions you need to dive right in alternatively a pool may indicate your need for cleansing you need to wash away the past people to see people you know in your dream signifies qualities and feelings of those people that you desire for yourself to see people you don't know in your dream denotes hidden aspects of yourself that you need to confront to see people from your past in your dream refers to your shadow and other unacknowledged aspects of yourself it can represent a waking situation that is bringing out similar feelings as your past relationships darkness to dream that darkness comes upon you signifies failure in work you may attempt darkness is synonymous with the ignorance unconscious evil death and fear of the unknown you will overcome your failure if the sun breaks through the darkness to dream that you cannot find someone in the darkness signifies that you need to keep your temper in check you have the tendency to let your emotions get out of control and lose your temper to dream that you are lost in the darkness denotes feelings of desperation depression or insecurity to dream that you are groping around in the darkness symbolizes that you have insufficient information to make a clear decision do your research and do not rush into making choices red red is an indication of raw energy force vigor intense passion aggression power courage and passion the color red has deep emotional and spiritual connotations red is also the color of danger shame sexual impulses and urges perhaps you need to stop and think about your actions moon to see the moon in your your dream represents something hidden mystery and the feminine aspect of your self in particular a full moon signifies completion whereas a new moon symbolizes new beginnings to dream that the moon in odd in any way signifies infidelity of your lover and disappointments in business to see the eclipse of the moon in your dream signifies that your feminine side is being overshadowed it also foretells of illness of someone near you sun to see the sun in your dream symbolizes peace of mind enlightenment tranquility fortune goodwill and insight it also represents radiant energy it is a good omen to have the sun shining in your dream  Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Force (Star Wars) Numerology Narcissism Moon Carl Jung Link (Legend of Zelda) Pysanka W.I.T.C.H.

creepy dream what could it mean so i was at a public pool when i seen this guy i know him in real life he passed away about months ago and i saw him walking beside the pool with another guy i just stared at him as he walked by i turned my head around to keep looking at him and all of a sudden i felt this very strong pull on my right side and when i looked up i saw his face it was all gross like a zombie type and he shouted in my ear watch your back honey and i woke up super scared and the whole right side of my body felt like pins and needles like when its asleep and waking up totally creepy oh and i was not close to this guy i didnt know him that well i just knew him from church what could this mean here is the analysis from zigmond froid's dream book the pool represents your mother or your birth water birth so maybe he was somehow related to her or your birthday or something like that walking beside the pool is easy walking a trip a trip death shouting might mean a cry for help or fear maybe he died in a scary way or maybe you are afraid of dying how he died etc the zombie face could be related to you seeing a similar face on tv a couple days before or talking about it with friends the physical pins 'n needles is completely normal after having an intense dream just remember that dreams are the minds way of clearing out your brains ram memory from the days or weeks events that's all in rare cases dreams can cross quantum worlds and provide incite about the past present or future  Out-of-body experience Shaggy dog story The Inside Prank flash The Amber Spyglass Dream Milton H.

what does my nightmare mean okay two days ago i had a terrible nightmare and i woke up crying in the dream i was talking with my mom and we were in the shore the clouds started turning gray and black and a huge wave came towards us so we ran because we didnt want to get wet then another huge wave came towards us and we heard my little brothers screaming because we forgot that my little they were playing in the water all we saw was my little brothers being carried into the sea i was trying to go and save them but for some reason something was holding me back me and my mom were both crying it was horrible i dont know how to describe it but the whole place looked real scary the sky was black and purple and there was nothing around us exept for the beach and a weird building wow to me it sounds symbolical well when you said when the clouds started turning gray that means that troubles might be comeing to you or someone else you know or don't know it's a sign that something bad is going to happen then you said when a huge wave came toward you to me that sounds like a huge problem or worries are going to happen it doesn't mean it's going to happen to you it could happen to anybody in the future then when you wrote another wave came toward you that means someone you know or it could be yourself is going to have even more problems when you also wrote when you saw your little brothers got carried to the sea that could be that something might happen to them or in the future you or your mom will probably so depressed by the problems that you probably forgot about your lil brothers remeber it doesn't mean it could be you or your brothers then when you said that something was holding you back sounds like you were trying to save them but something is in your way to try and save them also it could be that your weak in some sort maybe spiritualy or emotionaly this sounds very very similiar to this testomony this guy at church had he said that god was going to take all the children because god did not want them to suffer yes i know that it is sad and hard but in the end of times god is going to be takeing a lot of kids because again he doesn't want them to go through whats going to happen to this world i don't want to scare you and make you think that your brothers are going to die soon or sumthing i does sounds very scary and i wouldn't want to have those kinds of dreams even though sometimes i do the dream could be about someone else that is going through a problem if you need any more advice email me at michelle beauty yahoo com try praying before you go to bed because i know that if i don't pray before i don't go to bed i get nightmares and can't go to sleep hope this helped and hopefully pleasant dreams  Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Time Out of Mind Miss Saigon Pitaten Piccolo Junior Saga Characters of The Sandman Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Scenes from a Memory Dream Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Space opera in Scientology doctrine The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Sin City Invader Zim Rich Mullins Avenue Q Wes Craven's New Nightmare Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Social rule Pok__mon Live!

a proffesional dream interpritators opinion ok so yesterday i spent the day on the computer like i usually do and i looked at tupac alive therios for the majority of the time now when i went to bed i dreamed i was at my cousins house and there were a lot of my family there well later on in the dream i am at the dinner table with my mom and i look at the window and a vision appears its a black and white picture of the white house and the sky is pitch black clouds and the moon is tupac and he has the pose like george wasington on a quarter then a table appears the same table jesus was protyaed in his last supper picture exept there were two tupacs sitting down and then one more appeared and said i told you implying i told you im dead idk thats what i would like to know if he came to me in my dream and sent me some kind of message later in this dream i was playing a video game then there was another vision of tupac that scared me and woke me up what does all this mean i dont know what to think of it the fact is this dream had nothing to do with tupac in my dream it was thru my eyes and i saw visions what does it mean if you see visions in your dream and in my dream i was spending time at my cousins house with family and whatnot like i usually do and when i saw that vision i became afraid in my dream i woke up about three times last night i had different dreams and most of them i cant remember i only remember that part and anyone who thinks the tupac alive theories are false and think he is dead should check out this website http www tupac m m com it means you are using your head as something other than a hat rack and that in searching for one truth you find many more and if you can handle the truths behind the lies that lie under the truth that is really a lie all together now all it means is that you are a dreamer and that your dreams like your life can be what you make them so who knows maybe tupac did give you a message work it out  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tupac Shakur Lucid dreaming Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Resurrection of Jesus Philip K.

choosing dreams is there a way to chose what u dream about how oh yes i do it all the time when you're falling asleep just make up a story whatever you want to dream about make it as if you're watching a movie or tv show be one of the characters in your story and just have at it picture everything out as you go along if you're having trouble getting ideas or don't really know what exactly you want to dream about then think of something you already know about think of a tv show and then just make up and play an episode in your head that you've adjusted to have you in it it may not be exactly what you started thinking about when you do fall asleep and start dreaming but it'll be a sort of guide for your brain as to what you dream the idea i guess is that the last thing you think about when you fall asleep is usually what you dream about so if you concentrate on it actually being your dream it'll happen or if you're asking b c there's smthing you want to not dream about try doing the same or go to bed right after reading a book or watching some tv that is unrelated to the theme of the bad dreams you're having or are afraid you might have  Philosophical skepticism Wheel of Fortune The Shining (film) Dream Out-of-body experience The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Lucid dreaming Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Avenue Q Whose Line Is It Anyway?

i want to know i have dreams about things and then i see what i saw in my dream in real life i dont remember what my dream was about when i wake up but when i see it in real life i can see in my head the dream that i saw in real life i dont want to sound crazy or anything but am i seeing into the future i know that is the most stupid thing to say but is that what it is or what help an example was at my friends birthday party we were walking down the street and in the dream i saw another friend putting on her coat then i saw excalty what i saw in the dream she was in front of me putting on her light blue jacket another example i always seem to guess what ramdon people are thinking or saying like my sister was about to get hurt riding a scooter i told her to get off but she didnt and then i watched her get hurt and its what i saw before she got hurt please help me you may have some genuine psychic ability or a very high level of empathy for people so you can deduce what may happen or what they are likely to say your mind picks up clues that you are not consciously aware of for the dreams it's likely what they call deja vu when you're in a familiar situation like walking w your friends certain elements will be present then the next time some of the same things or people will be there and your mind will fill in the rest every though not everything is exactly the same you remember something that may not really have occurred in the dream you should look this up for more information i'm not explaining it too well either way you don't have to be afraid of this talent it's all perfectly natural and a lot of people have it  Dream Lucid dreaming Jon Secada Social rule Out-of-body experience Theory of conduct The Shining (film) Shaggy dog story W.I.T.C.H.

i had another wierd dream what could it mean it was like i was in my bathroom which has a window that looks out into my backyard and i was looking out the window then i saw my mom and sister playing with the robot thing there's this group of trees on the outside of our fence and when i looked over there i saw this little troll doll you know the things with the crazy hair and stuff walking out of the group of trees it wasn't a robot or anything it was just a troll doll then it walked over to my sister and mom then i woke up d what could it mean weird don't take any of this too seriously and disregard the dramatic text in the excerpts from a book someone gave me as a gift because i was always having the wierdest dreams glass 'to dream that you are looking through glass denotes that bitter disappointments will cloud your brightest hopes ' window 'to see windows in your dreams is an augury of fateful culmination to your bright hopes fruitless endeavours will be your portion after this dream to look through a window and see strange objects appear foretells that you will fail in your chosen avocation and lose the respect for which you risked health and contentment ' mother 'for a woman to dream of her mother as she appears in the home signifies pleasing results from any enterprise ' sister the book only had something on stepsisters go figure but 'to romp and play with children denotes that all your speculation and love enterprises will prevail ' gargoyl similar enough to troll 'means that you and a close friend will part ways to dream of one coming to life signifies that sorrow and misfortune are imminent ' trees or woods 'to dream of woods brings a natural change in your affairs depending on the nature of the woods if they appear green the change will be lucky if stripped leaves it will prove otherwise ' my vague interpretation of these separate components combined is that there is something in business or a relationship you have been working hard on and had high hopes for and which has been thriving and successful so far signified by your playing mother and sister its present prosperity is going to change signified by the trees woods for the worse with a parting of ways signified by the troll and the glass window  Pysanka W.I.T.C.H.

shot in broad daylight by an old man what gives i had a nightmare that my mom and i were outside of a store in my car parked on the side of the street she was in the back seat and i in the driver's seat all of a sudden two males came running out of the store one with a small bag the other just running they ran past my car and behind it it seemed they were running to a pick up truck parked behind me there were alot of ppl on the street watching an older man which i'm guessing was the owner came out shooting at these two men one got away the other however whom i was watching in my rearview mirror was shot in the right arm and leg upon me screaming the old man turned to my car and stuck the gun in the back window where my mother was and i tried to start the car up and take of but he just started shooting and shooting and she was screaming then i tried to pull off and he shot me like times and then he turned to an elderly lady on the sidewalk and shot her i have no idea where this came from wowzers help dreams are just that dreams there is no reality in a dream because they are created from the subconscious mind and not the conscious mind the difference between the two parts of the mind is this conscious thoughts have validity and can be compartmentalized into catagories that you can control with your own will power while subconscious thoughts are all in a big vat and stirred up all together and pulled out at random with no ability to control them whatsoever your subconscious mind will take the person you saw this morning and put them in a box you used for storage yesterday and place them it in a dumpster you put the trash into last week and create a dream there is no reason for it and no valitity to it it is just a dream dreams come when we do not reach deep sleep and therefore hear sounds or noises that stir our subconscious into reasoning where those noises come from and what is creating them since the subconscious cannot find the answer it creates one thus you dream the best way to avoid dreaming is to do whatever you need to do to clear your conscious mind before you go to bed so that you can rest properly some ways to do that are to exercise in the evening take walks read for awhile avoid late eating avoid heavy action movies several hours before bedtime and watch something lighter or even take sleeping pills if all the rest fails to work you most likely watched some sort of war or espionage type movie recently and coupled it with some news about a hold up or something your subconscious just created the show for your benefit from all the stuff you put into its vat hope that helps  Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Scenes from a Memory Rose (Doctor Who) Shaggy dog story Out-of-body experience Sleep Dream Insomnia Daylight saving time James Hanratty Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Grandview, U.S.A.

nd dream that i cheated on my boyfriend what's the deal i had a dream last night that i had sex with some guy i don't know i had a dream like this a couple months ago too this is time i actually said something to the guy about my boyfriend and even called him my boyfriend the guy looked at me a little funny but didn't have problem hopping in bed with me the weird part is that this guy looked similar to my boyfriend his body felt just like my boyfriends in the dream the only difference was he was a little taller why do i have dreams like this i love my boyfriend and only want to be with him i wouldn't ever imagine cheating on him and i know he wouldn't either what's the deal according to dreamcrowd to dream that you are cheating on your spouse mate fianc or significant other suggests feelings of self guilt and self betrayal you may have compromised your beliefs or integrity and or wasting your energy and time on fruitless endeavors alternatively it reflects the intensity of your sexual passion and exploring areas of your sexuality it is actually a reaffirmation of your commitment furthermore it is not uncommon for people approaching a wedding to have dreams about erotic experiences with partners other than their intended spouses most likely such dreams represent the newness of your sexual passion it may also signify anxieties of changing your identity that of a spouse to dream that your mate spouse or significant other is cheating on you indicates your fears of being abandoned you may feel a lack of attention in the relationship alternatively you may feel that you are not measuring up to the expectations of others this notion may stem from issues of trust or self esteem the dream could also indicate that you are unconsciously picking up hints and cues that your significant other is not being completely truth or is not fully committed in the relationship to dream that you are cheating at a game suggests that you are not being honest with yourself try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  Polyamory Homophobia Sexual orientation EastEnders Love Grief Child sexuality Psychoanalysis Human sexual behavior Marriage Plame affair Zoophilia S__ren Kierkegaard Sigmund Freud Narcissism Knots Landing Divorce Franz Boas Transsexuality Domination & submission (BDSM) Milton H.

what does this recurrent dream meant this dream i have been having for more than yrs then it just stopped for no apperent reason this dream was recurrent occuring day after day except one night where i had a different dream this recurrent dream was like i would be falling from great height wearing a white or pale blue frock soundlessly screaming my hair flowing about me like being caught in a wind i would be falling to some whirpool of water there was nothing else just me falling forever and this strange water whirlpool the thing is i would never reach the bottom this dream would occur day after day except one night when i dreamt of everything black but a small shining being of a sort holding an umbrella it was actually a pleasant dream i have since then stopped having these dreams i still cant figure out wat they meant i wud remember them clearly every time i woke up i dont believe very firmly dat every dream has a meaning but dreams like dis so regular which then just disappear are strange just thougt to add as well this dream has been there since the earliest days of my life and am only btw well yeah mayb its physiological but i sometimes wish i would dream of it again that feeling of falling and falling and falling without ever hitting the bottom was sort of releasing you had this dream every single night then it seems to me that perhaps it might have been an aspect of your brain chemistry that was triggering something i e when you were finally ready to fall fast asleep and losing 'control' of your waking brain activity i say that it just might be physiological rather than some sort of hidden message because it happened every night  Dream Lucid dreaming Narcolepsy The Shining (film) Sleep Out-of-body experience Urinary incontinence Salad Fingers Cliff Richard Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Philosophical skepticism Scenes from a Memory Rod Stewart Daz Dillinger A Day in the Life Hypnosis 1957 World Series Electroencephalography Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Puberty Waking the Dragons Sin City Rayman Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Avenue Q Dave Matthews Band Wheel of Fortune Miss Saigon DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Sega Saturn Bong Characters of The Sandman Oasis (band) 50 First Dates Frankie Laine Hypoglycemia Green Day Saga (band) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Eternal return Haibane Renmei Artificial neural network Billboard Hot 100 USS Trigger (SS-237) Clinical depression Spice Girls One Tree Hill (TV series) Atomic Kitten Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Time and the Rani She Loves You Sonic the Hedgehog 2 World Series Deus ex machina Hiberno-English D__j__ vu CPU cache Fasting Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Sting (musician) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Rapid eye movement W.I.T.C.H.

another crazy one here bout dreams i've been dreaming bout a guy i like for the past three months after i move to another town and we are like really close childhood friends we still chat online and i still visit him i don't want to ask him out cause i know it won't happen don't ask why is there any way to stop dreaming bout him don't assume it's a romantic interest but don't rule it out relationships are best based on friendship first perhaps the memory of this trusted friend is appearing in your dreams because the move was stressful or you feel a bit lonely or isolated in the new place this feeling may change as your circle of friends grows and your comfort level increases but with a good friend like this continue to stay in touch you stay married to someone a long long time long after the good looks and the passion disappear that's when you really need a friend who knows and care for the inner you you may find as you mature that this uninteresting guy is exactly the kind you should have been looking for hopefully you decide before he's off the market for good think less about romance and more about who will support your development as a good human beimg romance will follow trust me  Humphrey Bogart W.I.T.C.H.

can anyone interprest this dream it is a dream from god everybody is welcome to intepret it but i would need someone who is a christian and understands biblical interpretation but here is my dream i was looking at a field and there was a large tree about ft long laying on it's side the tree was rotted and decaying i proceeded to the tree with caution looking for snakes i grabbed the top end of the tree and lifted it it was like a top layer of the tree came up and fell over onto the ground inside that first layer was nothing buy decaying tree fiber i grabbed it a second time and a second layer came off with nothing under it except decaying tree fiber then at the third layer i saw a huge earthworm which was about and half ft long and as big around as a coke bottle i notices that half of it was like destroyed or deflated i pulled the earthworm out and put it on the ground i said in the dream whoa everyone has to see this then i noticed something moving in place where the earthworm was it was a centipede the okay contiuing on the centipede was the same size as the worm i said again wow look at the size of this i took a stick and pried the centipede out of the tree and got it onto the ground i took a stick and held it's head down while i tried to grab it when i went to grab it it curled around my around and tried to bite me i was worried in my dream because i knew centipedes are poisonous i wrestled with it and it bit me anyway but the bite did not harm me finally i managed to grab it by it's head i had it in a awkward position i pulled on it's head but it dug it's claws into my arm i felt that i could have pulled it's head off but i felt some compassion some people appeared and asked me if i needed help they tried to pull the centipede's claws out of my arm but when they pulled one set out another went in then i felt a heart beating from the centipede since it was stretched across my back like a towel then the dream ended i woke up bothered in the bible numbers usually mean something the fact that you peeled the bark back three times through three layers may mean that you will make attempts to unconver something that is hidden the tree represents something that is rotting from within and you are searching for what is going on the earthworm represents something that had been protected but was attacked and is halfway defeated and devoured by satan the centipede represents satan who has destroyed this person or at least half of them and this tree over time it now seeks to devour you however you you are fighting he still clings to you and seeks to devour you yet you are struggling against him and he may be start to gain a foothold in your life as you can start to feel his heartbeat think about your church a close friend of yours your family something that could be rotting undernieth that you are not aware of once you expose what is going on the person you rescued the worm will be saved but satan will turn his vengence on you remember satan is the father of lies and the only power he has is his lies someone you know or perhaps many people may have been decieved perhaps something that has been passed down through generations or has creeped up seek the truth in everything you know something is being disguised here and you may be discovering a closely hidden or guarded secret that satan is going to fight like mad to be sure it isn t exposed the people watching and asking if you need help are people around you if they help they will be attacked too but you will need them and their prayers otherwise satan will overpower you  Professional wrestling holds Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling throws Shaggy dog story Snake Tenshinhan Vegeta RuneScape quests Piccolo (Dragon Ball) The Amber Spyglass Suplex Piccolo Junior Saga Incarnations of Immortality Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist K' Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Sin City Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Kain (Legacy of Kain) Professional wrestling attacks Osiris Satan LaVeyan Satanism Dragon boat The Shining (film) The Legend of Zelda series enemies Tag Mattress Joseph (Hebrew Bible) God Emperor of Dune The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Naruto jutsu Escape from New York God The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Textile manufacturing InuYasha StarCraft Secret Missions Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Piledriver (professional wrestling) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March StarCraft: Uprising Great Old Ones compendium The Curse of Fenric Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Pok__mon Live!

what does this dream mean i have had a few dreams that my boyfriend is really rude to me then breaks up with me for dumb reasons that would normally not matter like talking to my friends it makes no sense to me why i have these every once in a while according to dreamcrowd to see your boyfriend in your dream represents your waking relationship with him and how you feel about him to dream that your boyfriend is dead indicates that something in your own self that is no longer functional and is dead you are not being allowed to fully express yourself it is also symbolic of your own relationship with that person perhaps you need to let go of this relationship if your boyfriend is away and your dreams of him involve a lot of touching signify how much you miss his presence and have him being nearby the dream is telling you not to take the day to day things for granted learn to cherish the smaller things in life to dream that your boyfriend tells you that he is gay or that he doesn't love your anymore represents your own insecurities with the relationship it may also mean that the relationship is moving to a new level to which you are expressing some anxiety and fears about the changing situation you may feel left out it in his life or that you are unable to share in all his experiences it boils down to trust and communication try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  One Tree Hill (TV series) Scenes from a Memory W.I.T.C.H.

violent dreams for awhile now i've had dreams many where people are chasing after me and i have to escape them lately said people are catching me and really hurting or killing me wtf i'm being chased chase dreams often stem from feelings of anxiety in your walking life the way we respond to anxiety and pressure in real life is typically manifested as a chase dream running is an instinctive response to physical threats in our environment often in these dream scenarios you are being pursued by some attacker who wants to hurt or possibly kill you you are running away hiding or trying to outwit your pursuer chase dreams may represent your way of coping with fears stress or various situations in your waking life instead of confronting the situation you are running away and avoiding it ask yourself who is the one chasing you and you may gain some understanding and insight on the source of your fears and pressure the pursuer or attacker who is chasing you in your dream may also represent a part of yourself your own feelings of anger jealousy fear and possibly love can assume the appearance of threatening figure you may be projecting these feelings onto the unknown chaser next time you have a chase dream turn around and confront your pursuer ask them why they are chasing you one may be consumed by their own anger jealousy love or self destructive behavior for example you may be drinking too much or exhibiting open hostility toward others around you you may subconsciously be threatened by these actions which have been jeopardizing your relationships and or career your dreams are a way of calling attention to these self destructive actions a more direct analysis of chase dreams is the fear of being attacked such dreams are more common among women than men who may feel physically vulnerable in the urban environment these dreams are inspired by fears of violence and sexual assault in which we are so over exposed from the media the violence that the media portrays magnifies our fears and how at risk we all are hurt to dream that you are hurt signifies wounded emotions or feelings that you may have suppressed you need to address these feelings in order to properly heal killing to dream that you killed someone forewarns that heavy stress may cause you to lose your temper and self control identity the characteristics of the person that you have killed and ask yourself if you feel any rage towards this person in your waking life you may be expressing some rage or hatred toward this person to dream that you have been killed suggests that your actions are disconnected from your emotions this dream may also represent a part of you or your life that you wish would leave you alone and stop creating a nuisance killing may represent the killing off of old parts of yourself and old habits  Domestic violence Anger management Borderline personality disorder Post-traumatic stress disorder Narcissism Hulk (comics) Homophobia Rape Dog Fathers' rights God Emperor of Dune Transactional analysis Anxiety Obsessive-compulsive disorder Sigmund Freud EastEnders Gender role Psychoanalysis Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Daredevil Human Karen Horney Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Human sexual behavior Joker (comics) A Course In Miracles Simone Weil Anger Hikikomori Anorexia nervosa Columbine High School massacre The Shining (film) Transsexuality Second language acquisition Dissociative identity disorder Emotion Antisocial personality disorder Gestalt therapy Dead Like Me Motivation Paranoia Agent Media and ethnicity Alexander Technique Sadism and masochism Chapterhouse Dune Kain (Legacy of Kain) Macbeth Asperger syndrome Maison Ikkoku Self-harm The Brothers Karamazov Enneagram Reparative therapy Equilibrium (2002 film) Anarcho-primitivism Green Goblin Ex-gay Autism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Existentialism Hypoglycemia Thor (Marvel Comics) Vulcan (Star Trek) Sleep Zoophilia Sexual orientation Bully Hip hop rivalries Boston Public Hate group Charmed Internet troll Alcoholism Cordelia Chase Venom (comics) Pontiac's Rebellion W.I.T.C.H.

what do you call the study of dreams i have dreams that my boyfriend is breaking up with me often and it's always my fault i want to know what they mean according to dreamcrowd to see your boyfriend in your dream represents your waking relationship with him and how you feel about him to dream that your boyfriend is dead indicates that something in your own self that is no longer functional and is dead you are not being allowed to fully express yourself it is also symbolic of your own relationship with that person perhaps you need to let go of this relationship if your boyfriend is away and your dreams of him involve a lot of touching signify how much you miss his presence and have him being nearby the dream is telling you not to take the day to day things for granted learn to cherish the smaller things in life to dream that your boyfriend tells you that he is gay or that he doesn't love your anymore represents your own insecurities with the relationship it may also mean that the relationship is moving to a new level to which you are expressing some anxiety and fears about the changing situation you may feel left out it in his life or that you are unable to share in all his experiences it boils down to trust and communication try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  One Tree Hill (TV series) Scenes from a Memory EastEnders W.I.T.C.H.

i had a crazy dream last night i was with a class full of people and we were stuck on top of this huge house and the only way out was to ride a log like a 'log ride' type thing down to safety but the only problem was there was no where to hang on to and they gave me a baby to hold so i was sitting on top of a log trying to keep this baby safe and not fall off it was really scary what's it mean well i looked it up online and it says baby to see a baby in your dream signifies innocence warmth and new beginnings log to see logs in your dream represents unconscious ideas and a significant and meaning aspect of yourself alternatively it signifies a transformation you are headed toward a new direction in your life to dream that you are sitting on a log indicates personal satisfaction and joy in you life to see a log floating in water represents new opportunities you may be overlooking something important class to dream that you forgot to attend a class you signed up for indicates your anxieties and fear of failing you may also be lacking self confidence in your ability to handle new responsibilities or projects i might be wrong but it might help  Jon Secada One Tree Hill (TV series) Out-of-body experience Psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud Milton H.

i've been having a dream of a stalker it is the nd time this has happened but in both reams they were different people in the first dream i was driving my friends van i don't know why and i had alot of clothing with me and my dog as well i pulled over to ask directions from a police officer and in a car on my right this pyscho started hitting on me i started speeding up to get away but eventually we got stuck in traffic and he got out of the car i got out of the car started running and it all ended in my being raped i then made some agreement so that this man wouldn't harm my family even if it meant hurting me eventually i got home all my my stuff including my dog and the van were home as if nothing had even happened my father and my brothers went nuts when i told them and the mad hunt began by the time we were all in the car ready to go the station i woke up the nd dream is a little different i was new at college and i only knew people there my older brother and this other guy i had all my things with me my dog my clothing and i was moving into the dorm but for some reason i kinda skipped the me settlnig into the dorm part and we kinda went straight into socializing on the campus there was this guy blonde hair blue eyes tall and built just gorgeous woh was apparently one of the most popular guys at the school somehow this guy had his eyee on me but i refused so he kept pushing andi kept saying no eventually this became a dangerous situation whenever he saw me he would go crazy doing everything in his power to get to me and i would be running and hiding and he'd be breaknig down walls to get to me there was this other girl who had a crush on him but hated me b c he had his eye set on me anyway the last thing that happened in the dream was a school party and we were all in a huge gym and for some reason i thought he was dead but he wasnt someone told him i was there and he came after me i had to run into the basement then sneak into someone elses dorm room this girl who let me go to her dorm had a crush on my brother either way by the time i got there i realized that the girl who hated me was there i followed her into another room after she had scoffed at me but whne i got there she disappeared then i woke up i think i also should mention that the dorm rooms looked like old dirty jail cells for some reason only a few of them looked like regular rooms also i know this is getting long lol but i'm not going to a sleep away college i'm currently attending a community college which is why thisthe nd dream struck me as very strange i also should add that i havent actually seen stories on the tv about stalkers i make it a way of life not to watch the news unless its the weather or read the newspaper unless it involves something in my career choice according to dreamcrowd to see or drive a van in your dream symbolizes convenience and or practicality consider the load that you are carrying and what you can handle don't stress yourself out dreaming about the police could symbolize many different things so please consider all of the details carefully if the police are chasing you it suggests that you may be feeling some guilt about something that you have done or have been thinking of doing the police could be addressing karmic law as well as the laws in our physical world if you are feeling that you can't meet all of your obligations and fear repercussions due to an unmet commitment the police may be an unwelcome sight on a more positive note and depending on the details of your dream the police could symbolize support and protection your emotional response to the dream will provide you with good clues to interpreting this dream accurately old dream interpretation books say that dreaming about police is an indication that you will obtain unexpected assistance with a current problem try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  Sin City Shaggy dog story Scenes from a Memory Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) EastEnders Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) The Catcher in the Rye W.I.T.C.H.

why when i dream that it's snowing outside i feel so awesome in my dream i have a strange feeling i don't know if i'm using the good word but i feel like it's magical lol did i say that i was emotionless in my dream i said i felt awesome in my dream is that emotionless to you lol maybe it's because of the fascination most people experience when they are very young when it comes to snow when we are very little we equate snow with magic with christmas holidays family gifts santa reindeer the north pole for some we never lose that magical feeling when we see snow falling maybe some people do consciously forget but subconsciously the pleasant magical memories are still there and it's through dreaming that often the door to the subconscious mind opens up and it allows these forgotten memories and emotions to be remembered and re lived  Unconscious mind Dream Lucid dreaming The Cure Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Consciousness Scenes from a Memory Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants Dean Koontz Santa Claus Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Cliff Richard Rankin/Bass The McGuire Sisters Carl Jung Jon Secada Philosophical skepticism Hypnosis Frosty the Snowman LOL (Internet slang) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Amber Spyglass The Shining (film) Infantilism Christmas Empathy Out-of-body experience Sigmund Freud Christmas television special Christmas worldwide Carlos Castaneda Star Ocean: The Second Story Scarlet Witch The Smoking Room Human Bene Gesserit Edgar Cayce Skiing Psychedelic drug Soul Chaos magic Darwin from Insectivorous plants to Worms Time Out of Mind Magic (paranormal) Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (television special) Social rule Wizarding world Fritz Leiber Magic (Harry Potter) Memory RuneScape quests Please Save My Earth Eyes Wide Shut Charmed The Mother Rich Mullins Yoko Ono Philosophy of mind Witchcraft Rent (musical) False memory 10cc Christmas song E.

my dreams often come true every weeks or so i get really vivid dreams where i'm in an everyday place and something happens e g a friend says something someone trips over it starts raining a few weeks sometimes months after these dreams come true and actually happen is this a premonition or a prediction by my brain is there a way in which i can increase these types of dreams it is not a precognition i think cause that would be when your brain sees something that is actually happening but somewhere else for example the magicians in tribal populations could see the white invadors arriving a long time before cause they'd see them on their way already but then it would take weeks or more for them to arrive in your case you might be making true some of the things you imagined when u find urself in a situation similar to the one in ur dream your subconscious remembers about it and 'creates it' makes it come true you can increase these types of dreams and also improve your controlling skills with lucid dreaming techniques  Dream Out-of-body experience Lucid dreaming Unconscious mind Magic (paranormal) Philosophical skepticism D__j__ vu Hypnosis Autism Jon Secada Consciousness Telepathy Magic (illusion) Precognition Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Free will Psychosis Children of Dune Parapsychology Direct realism Therion (band) Astral projection Scenes from a Memory Aphasia Negima Miracle The Martian Chronicles Haibane Renmei Weather lore Infantilism Wheel of Fortune Storytelling Stuttering Freeters Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Minority Report (film) 50 First Dates Stroke Hypnagogia Emanuel Swedenborg Debugging Kimi Finster CPU cache Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants A Course In Miracles Cliff Richard I Have a Dream Falsifiability Traumatic brain injury Social rule Artificial neural network Stereoscopy Avenue Q John Berryman Left-handed Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Datalore (TNG episode) Remember...

why do i still keep having dreams about my ex i have been separated and divorced from my ex for almost years now she has gone on been married and divorced and is basically no great catch although i try to remain civil with her since we have a child she is not friendly attractive or anything i really like but when i dream about her i feel so rejected why am i dreaming about her anyway i have been in about short term relationships haven't met the one and not sure if i want to settle down with anyone i just don't understand what kind of hold she still has on me after all this time because your marriage vows before god and man went like this for better or for worse for richer or for poorer in sickness and in heatlh 'til death were you supposed to part there's some real karma going on here and you have an inner conscience that's talking to you deep down that child means something also this is also why no other relationships are working out you might want to consider being bold having a real talk with her and possibly get back together there could be a window of opportunity for this to happen  Marriage Theory of conduct Theodicy S__ren Kierkegaard Family Divorce Same-sex marriage Polygamy Humphrey Bogart God Emperor of Dune Luke and Laura Spencer Fiddler on the Roof Predestination Phoebe Halliwell Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Women in Islam Friends Eucharist The nature of God in Western theology Philosophical skepticism Scenes from a Memory Karen Horney Game show Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jewish view of marriage Polyamory Presuppositional apologetics Karma Cyberspace Sant Thakar Singh Causality Supernatural Jon Secada John Wesley Religion and sexuality Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Sexual orientation Claudius Conscience Sin The Amber Spyglass Laura Schlessinger Existence Justification (theology) Kender Cary Grant Marilyn Monroe Miss Saigon Caste Masculism Another World (TV series) Salvation Maison Ikkoku Christian view of marriage Love Brigham Young Economic inequality Stan Laurel A Course In Miracles Animism Mail-order bride X Window System Homosexuality and Christianity The Shining (film) Incarnations of Immortality Kodocha Time Out of Mind Dream Eastern Orthodox Church Henry VIII of England Henry Fonda Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Poverty Milton H.

dream meaning i dreamt last night that i awoken by a meteor shower i watched it for a while and one landed silently in my garden i went out to look and there was a huge ram lying in the garden it was the size of a bull what does it mean the fact that you woke up in your dream signifies that new ideas are being realized the meteor shower suggests that you will experience success in a project and that you are trying to realize your greatest desires that are coming at you head on the garden is simply peace and tranquility while the large ram displays that you are pursuing a decision that should definitely be approached with more tact and consideration  Dream Sin City Out-of-body experience Frank Herbert Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) RISC Meteor Characters of The Sandman Avenue Q Meteor shower Milton H.

friends from school i keep having dreams of people that i went to school with nothing in paticular is going on just normal day to day stuff i figured its because i have a myspace account but half the time its people who are not on my friends list these people just come out of nowhere i am years old and the last time i seen some of these people was years ago but in my dream they look the same as when we were kids why according to dreamcrowd our dreams are full of symbolism with their messengers being all different types of people it is very common to dream about our friends these are individual that are emotionally valuable to us and we learn about ourselves through them dreams are very rarely prophetic thus whether your dream was good or bad don't expect it to come true this dream is more than likely attempting to bring up uncomfortable feelings that you have about yourself or others remember uncomfortable does not necessarily mean bad dreams are created by our own thinking processes our own thoughts conscious or unconscious create dreams thus the mind that created the dream also knows its meaning see also people try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  Dream Unconscious mind Sigmund Freud Consciousness Out-of-body experience Social rule Lucid dreaming Carl Jung Edgar Cayce Artificial consciousness Psychoanalysis Gender role Repentance Psychology of religion Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Jon Secada Surrealism Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants Theory of conduct Art Infantilism Objectivist philosophy Milton H.

this may sound like a stupid question when you're lucid dreaming how do u really wake up in real life after you're already basically awake thats confusing me oh and another thing possibly another stupid question if u hurt someone in your lucid dream it wont really have an effect on them right or if you hurt yourself no effect right please no rude comments thank you fro reading i don't know what causes one to wake up from a lucid dream but i think lucid dreams often have the most significant meanings and perhaps your waking up is a result of your brain wanting to remember what the dream was about by comparing it with the real waking world i've never been able to have a negative effect on someone with a lucid dream though i have had some interesting coincidences where i had lucid dreams about people i care about and they had one about me  Lucid dreaming Out-of-body experience Dream Philosophical skepticism Jon Secada Consciousness Binaural beats House of M Hypnagogia Social rule Frank Herbert Sleep Hypnosis Dream Theater Theory of conduct Philosophy of language Philosophy of mind Freddy Krueger Finnegans Wake Therion (band) Second language acquisition James Hillman Astral projection Computer numbering formats Narcolepsy Simulated reality Vanilla Sky Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Rudolf Steiner Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Sleep paralysis The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie American Idiot Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Irony Emanuel Swedenborg A Day in the Life Knots Landing Qualia Animism Phantasms (TNG episode) Milton H.

i had a dream and my mom was there okay i was in this room with people party i presume my mom was there she was in the center of the group and i was off to the side just watching her pants fell she didn't seem to realize it at first but then she pulled them up my mom was not embrased at all it seemed she felt like it was no big deal at all she probably continued to have a good time what do you think my dream means according to dreamcrowd the relationship that we have with our mother is the most psychologically significant relationship of all rarely all good or all bad our mothers always invoke powerful emotions we may dream about our mothers in many different forms she may be disguised in our dreams and it is our job to find her in there if you are dreaming about your mother you may be addressing some issues or concerns in your dream or your dream may be based on a valuable memory the general image of mother in a dream may symbolize a variety of feelings and ideas caring nurturing love acceptance hard work sacrifice martyrdom etc the mother in your dream could also represent the collective unconscious the source of the water of life and the yin carl jung suggests that women in dreams represent our collective unconscious and men the collective consciousness thus the woman is that force or current inside of you that nudges you on and inspires you it is your intuition and the knowledge that in not necessarily attached to words men on the other hand represent the active part of us that use the information received to create the physical reality of our lives when the two are working together well we have balance and experience awareness leading to peace and productivity see also parents try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  Carl Jung Sigmund Freud Dream Unconscious mind Psychoanalysis Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Milton H.

i had this strange dream i imagined that i was with the girl i like and we were going out but she left me for some reason to go out with her really good friend who lives way far away but the strange thing was that i saw her friend in the dream and ive never seen him before and she never described him to me before and when i asked her what he looked like it was exactly as i pictured him why probably you were able to visualize him in your dream because ou know this girl well enough to know what type of guys she would go for and what they would look like and your subconscious was able to supply the image which coincidently matches him in real life perhaps the dream was precognitive also  Telepathy Jon Secada Avenue Q Care Bears Super Mario Bros. 2 W.I.T.C.H.

please help me interpret this dream i had a few nights ago ok i had to drive south the entire length of lake winnipesaukee to get to my husband as i rounded a bend i drove into a hotel and all the rooms had glass walls you could see in every room and people in their rooms had monkeys and were playing with them then the hotel turned out to really be a boat hotel and the section i was on broke free from the rest and it went into the middle of a bunch of other sections i'm generally of the opinion that imagery in dreams has meaning that tends to be important to the dreamer and the fact that you noticed the specific lake and mentioned it here would indicate that lake winnipesaukee has some importance or meaning to you however i'm not privy to that information so i can't suss it out if you were my client i would ask you to determine what meaning does this lake have to you what feelings does it draw forth for you do you have good feelings associated with it or good memories etc the fact that you're trying to get to your husband could mean that you are in fact trying to get closer to your husband in waking life or it could be that you want to be more like something that your husband represents to you for example strength kindness resilience independence again i'm not getting a clear picture because your husband doesn't appear again within the dream it could go either way here depending on many factors so i leave the interpretation up to you here the imagery of a hotel with clear glass walls is interesting you can see into every room and basically you're seeing the hotel's inner workings and secrets common thought on dream content is that it is a way for your subconscious to work out some of its issues and i think that is a good way of interpreting the imagery here i think the hotel here is you looking at yourself so to speak in fact it is very possible that the entire drea is one where you're engaged in some very deep self examination and every image is a distinct part of yourself when you are looking at the hotel you are looking deeply at yourself and seeing into your own head perhaps you have some fears that you are transparent to others or you have a wish to better understand yourself but find that your own motives are somewhat confusing that you're playing with monkeys personally i like that image and symbolism and when you finally get into the hotel it's not quite what you thought it was it was a boat and it broke free and went into a bunch of the other sections this part is somewhat unclear and i suppose this is normal for dream logic i think if we go along with my interpretation of it being a self examination dream that you have a sense of feeling a bit lost at times it does reinforce this with an actual image of you being adrift in the hotel personally i'd look at this dream as one about personal growth and you feeling as if you are perhaps wanting to take a bit of time to figure out where you are right now if this doesn't seem to make sense then i'd try picking the dream apart for yourself image by image and ask what each symbol means to you and what image represents to you most symbols have personal meaning as well as universal meaning and the content of dreams usually lies somewhere in between  Philosophy of language Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Theory of conduct Unconscious mind Logic Lucid dreaming Infantilism Scientology beliefs and practices Dream Philosophical skepticism Variable Modal logic Supply and demand David Hume Determinism Ethics Friends Out-of-body experience Postmodernism Motivation W.I.T.C.H.

why do i keep having the same dream theme and what does it mean ever since i was younger i always had a common theme running in my dreams mostly it's that i am at home usually one that i don't recognize and the rest of my friends and family are there that's when i notice or sense a tornado and run all my friends and family out of my house make sure i have everyone then leave sometimes i run leading the tornado away from my family in an effort to help them get away after that in every dream i watch the tornado as it rips everything apart scared lifeless but interested amazed and almost feeling like i'm connected with the tornado each time i have this dream it's a new setting some different people but the basic story is the same i can't understand why i always wait at the end to watch because after that it always ends i should mention when i was a child i was interested in meteorology and i found tornadoes to be fascinating now my interest has lessened but this dream still persists any ideas thanks in advance d here are my thoughts the tornado represents chaos or a destructive powerful force which is threatening 'home' or your sense of identity sense of self you are protective of friends and family not wanting them to be hurt by your chaos or this change you're going through but ultimately you have to go through your own catharsis change or chaos to become a more mature 'improved version' of yourself if you will so of course you want to stay and see the final outcome because this is your own growth process happening before your eyes does any of that sound relevant to you  Jon Secada Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Chaos theory Scenes from a Memory The Shining (film) Theory of conduct Miss Saigon One Tree Hill (TV series) Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Social rule Incarnations of Immortality Sonic the Hedgehog DC Universe Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Sub-Zero Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Storytelling Cyberspace Karen Horney Shaggy dog story Death Comes to Time Tropical cyclone Palm Sunday Tornado Outbreak Hurricane Rita Carl Jung Yoga Sutras of Patanjali About a Boy Pitaten The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Infantilism Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind American Idiot Jiddu Krishnamurti Philosophical skepticism Mathematics Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Predestination W.

what does it mean when you see yourself going up in a red elevator i saw myself going up in a building with a red elevator and i reached the roof and when i got there there were a lot of young people in some kind of a pool party i'm young also so i didn't like to party and went two floors bellow i sat in a balcony closed my eyes and i could feel the fresh air what does this means thank you in advance thank you sugar babe red and elevators symbolize a rise in passion the fact that you didn't join the pool party party is self explanatory interacting with your peers and water pool is a kind of freedom a relaxing of inhibitions a link to the primal self since you went down floors retreating from the pool party it seems to me that you have decided not to give in to your primal urges and to not indulge in lowering your inhibitions especially since you found the air floors down refreshing my compliments good for you  World Trade Center King Khalid International Airport William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham Sauna Stairway Freedom Tower Urban beach Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Solar power Mid-levels Milton H.

help my dream thats slightly different each time i keep dreaming that i suddenly sat in the backseat of the car the car is moving but no one else in it i get worried the car will crash on the road so i have to hop into the driver's seat to start driving it before there is an accident as soon as i touch the steering wheel the car starts to get a little hard to control so i have to concentrate to keep it on the right side of the road i'm only and having taken a driving test but i have had lessons what does this mean my mother found apples on the floor when she was walking through the park there were no apple trees nearby does that mean anything special let's start with the apples you don't have to have apple trees in order to find apples on the ground people can drop apples anywhere this is actually considerably more relevant than it seems people often overlook the obvious when attempting to determine cause and effect this can lead to all kinds of superstition and religious belief i e 'we are here so 'god' must have put us here' or 'life is complex so it must have been created' as far as your dream about being in the back seat of the car that's a no brainer you are afraid of losing control while driving unless you are riding in the back seat and the driver decides to bail out that situation will never occur however you will run into situations while driving where you might lose control of the vehicle and being inexperienced you are right to be concerned about this keep a few things in mind always obey speed limits and if conditions are bad rain slow erratic traffic etc then slow down or even pull over always keep your hands on the wheel and do not talk on your cell phone put on makeup eat or do anything else while driving  Car handling Indianapolis 500 Automobile Tire Ayrton Senna Driving Road traffic accident Manual transmission Car safety Drag racing Bike lane debate Rules of the road Motorcycle Skateboarding trick Fast bowling Rain Man Road safety 24 Hours of Le Mans Formula One regulations Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Traffic light Driver's license Shaggy dog story Hitchhiking Drunk driving (United States) Airbag Cruise control 2000 Australian Grand Prix Badaling Expressway Anti-lock braking system Rear wheel drive Rail terminology Four wheel drive Sport utility vehicle Steering Formula One Jackass: The Movie Hybrid vehicle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Crash test dummy Aerial (dance move) Tank The Hitch-Hiker (The Twilight Zone) Bicycle Back to the Future Seat belt legislation Steering wheel Recumbent bicycle Tenshinhan Mercedes-Benz A-Class Fire fighting Traffic Billboard (advertising) Roush Racing Mach kernel Auto racing Escape from New York RISC Paul Is Dead Taxi Driver Headlight Predestination Formula One cars One Tree Hill (TV series) Father's Day (Doctor Who) Dodge Charger Seat belt Horse gait Transportation of Los Angeles Autobahn Railway signalling Gliding School bus Tractor Mitsubishi 3000GT Mario Bros. 2003 United States Grand Prix Mazda Miata Star Wars: Battlefront Road-rule enforcement camera 2001 Formula One season Dale Earnhardt

when i was young i had this dream once and it freaked me out my dad there was two of him it was strange they were both talking to me and it was obvious to me that they were trying to say which one was the real one but icouldn't hear no sound i took it that i had a fear of not hearing but i wouldn't care less to tell the truth so what did that dream mean my god i just remembered it i'd forgotten that for a while it always used to scare me thinking of it n i think i had it twice actually perhaps around that time you had heard someone you knew was adopted or told that his dad was really only a stepfather something seems to have given you doubts as to whether your father was really your true father or not and so he and the other father appeared you were deaf because you did not want to hear the truth if it was that your father wasn't your dad and that is a frightening thought for a small child  Philosophical skepticism Scenes from a Memory Hey Jude Jon Secada Shaggy dog story Social rule Daredevil Salad Fingers Dream Father's Day (Doctor Who) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theodicy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Out-of-body experience 2004 Republican National Convention Father Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Time Out of Mind Blonde on Blonde About a Boy Grandview, U.S.A.

what does this dream mean well i remember there was a row of us sitting on the floor somewhere and i was sitting next to this guy and i think we started play fighting or something then we kissed and then he tried to look down my top and i pushed him away laughing and he tried to pull me closer again the boy i regonise him as someone in the year above me at school we have never ever spoken so i have no idea why he appeared in my dream i also find the dream weird because i've never kissed anyone before also i've never been out with anyone seriously they wouldn't want to go out with me anyway haha chances are that particular boy being in your dream is just a coincidence your brain throwing a random boy into that situation however you've got to remember there is reason for your brain creating the dream in this manner you could want to date to kiss someone or something along those lines but be worried about what the consequences would be  Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Avenue Q 50 First Dates Dream Milton H.

i'm usually pretty good at doing this myself but i need someone to help me interpret this dream in the dream my year old son and i were at a red light he hopped out of the car and ran to the car ahead of us and got in with them for whatever reason i didn't get out but i was honking my horn like crazy for him to come back to me the light turned and we crossed the street and we were at my dad's station a chevron in real life my dad died years ago and he got out and he had a bag of cookies in his hand i quickly grabbed the cookies and looked and seen tiny pieces of pecans in them i was screaming and angry as i watched my son start to be able not to breathe in real life he is allergic to tree nuts i was crying and asking him why like why did you eat food from strangers because i taught you not to do this and i was angry not at him but at the people that gave him the food he was crying also because he knew he was dying is this a warning or is this just a fear dream please serious answers only i'd say this is simply a 'fear dream' not an intuitive one along the lines of a premonition or anything as a mother you have that protective instinct over your child sometimes the genuine concerns about the welfare and safety of your child will be 'transposed' into your dream life due to your subconscious fears of all possible scenarios of things that could happen especially since he's so little like getting into a car with strangers or eating food he's allergic to i'd say subconsciously youre worried that something bad might happen and you wont be there in time to intervene this is a normal 'fear' so long as it doesnt consume you and you become so over protective that you refuse to let your child have any freedom the cars life your life his life etc red light stop i e your 'rules' correction discipline etc honking your horn trying to get your son's attention i e 'listen to mommy' etc intersection crossroads direction i think this pertains to perhaps certain interests behaviours traits your son shows demonstrates that remind you of your dad were there some things that your father did that you saw as unhealty behaviours if so this could explain your concern that your son will grow up and take on those negative qualities reiterated by eating the bag of cookies with the nuts in them that causes him to die eating the cookies from 'strangers' innocence on the part of your son children tend to be very trusting and often accepting of things that interest them regardless of the source i'd say this part deals with your fears that as a child he's naive and gullible to be led into harms way the part of you asking him why addresses your fears that something bad will happen to him if he doesnt listen to you as does the scenario of him dying have you been having normal disciplinary issues with your son meaning he's simply being a child and testing the limits if so this could be why you dreamt it  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Theodicy Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) About a Boy Father's Day (Doctor Who) Infantilism Past teachings of Prem Rawat Second language acquisition The Amber Spyglass Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Marshall Mathers LP God Emperor of Dune Social justice Milton H.

what does it mean when i keep having dreams with people chasing me and trying to kill me i always have dreams where there are people trying to kill me or my family and i keep having to escape in different ways last night i had a dream where there were mobsters trying to kill me and i had to change my name and move country i couldn't stop moving otherwise they'd kill me i'm being chased chase dreams often stem from feelings of anxiety in your walking life the way we respond to anxiety and pressure in real life is typically manifested as a chase dream running is an instinctive response to physical threats in our environment often in these dream scenarios you are being pursued by some attacker who wants to hurt or possibly kill you you are running away hiding or trying to outwit your pursuer chase dreams may represent your way of coping with fears stress or various situations in your waking life instead of confronting the situation you are running away and avoiding it ask yourself who is the one chasing you and you may gain some understanding and insight on the source of your fears and pressure the pursuer or attacker who is chasing you in your dream may also represent a part of yourself your own feelings of anger jealousy fear and possibly love can assume the appearance of threatening figure you may be projecting these feelings onto the unknown chaser next time you have a chase dream turn around and confront your pursuer ask them why they are chasing you one may be consumed by their own anger jealousy love or self destructive behavior for example you may be drinking too much or exhibiting open hostility toward others around you you may subconsciously be threatened by these actions which have been jeopardizing your relationships and or career your dreams are a way of calling attention to these self destructive actions a more direct analysis of chase dreams is the fear of being attacked such dreams are more common among women than men who may feel physically vulnerable in the urban environment these dreams are inspired by fears of violence and sexual assault in which we are so over exposed from the media the violence that the media portrays magnifies our fears and how at risk we all are  Domestic violence Borderline personality disorder Post-traumatic stress disorder Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Anxiety Narcissism Rape Sigmund Freud Hikikomori God Emperor of Dune Anger management Obsessive-compulsive disorder Karen Horney Fathers' rights Homophobia Transactional analysis Dog Panic attack Anorexia nervosa Strategic management Pontiac's Rebellion Psychoanalysis Darth Vader EastEnders Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix BDSM Paranoia Agent Out-of-body experience Second language acquisition Simone Weil Yom Kippur War Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Daredevil The Shining (film) Chapterhouse Dune Clinical depression Hip hop rivalries Enneagram Unconscious mind Hulk (comics) Macbeth Sleep Te Kooti's War Cordelia Chase Characters of The Sandman Human Zoophilia Social psychology A Course In Miracles Gestalt therapy Free trade Kain (Legacy of Kain) Emotion One Tree Hill (TV series) Jean Grey On Her Majesty's Secret Service Bene Gesserit Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tag Transsexuality Animal communication Battle of France Existentialism Mulholland Drive (film) Antisocial personality disorder Charmed Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Infantilism Autism Maison Ikkoku Buffy Summers Motivation Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism The Death Gate Cycle Media and ethnicity Grief Refugee Nuclear warfare The Brothers Karamazov Boston Public Gender role Lupin III Jealousy 2003 Invasion of Iraq Procrastination Columbine High School massacre Anger Capital accumulation Risk

eating a human heart i dreamt that i was eating a human heart any interpretations yeah i agree with the others the heart represents the life of a individual and the motivation for what drives them by eating the heart it represents that you are devouring the life and ambition of someone you know it can be through words your actions spiteful or revenge but however your doing it you have the ability to crush them spiritually  Original sin Vegetarianism Evil Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Shamanism Vampire Lycanthropy Edgar Cayce Simone Weil Meaning of life Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Philipp Melanchthon Motivation Consciousness Love Holy Spirit W.I.T.C.H.

need some laughs obnoxious dream it's just a stress dream i'm sure but can you provide helpful insights it's rather chaotic but here it is i was at a building school getting ready for some event i dont remember what there was a ton of things going on i dont remember all then there was this guy who was trying to kill me that was like hunting me down and i was trying to hide from him he followed me to the building because this girl in the dream told him where i was every time i'd hide from him she'd tell him where i was then the phone starts ringing off the hook and theres all these people calling for no reason just to see if i was there i dont understand this part so i decide to finish what i was doing in prep for this event and leave i was putting up streamers or something then i remember that i had to call a woman i used to work with to warn her about this guy so i call her but she doesnt answer the phone this part was in another dream too wait for details then i call another person who i used to work with who irl i call frequently i say to her that the girl dimed me out and now my life's in jeporday and i need her to come get me she says she knows all about it but cant come because shes not supposed to be helping me so i say sorry i didnt want to get her in trouble but then she doesnt answer the phone again when i call her she was mad over something and was refusing to talk to me i dont understand this part but the guy was going to kill her too then i'm cleaning windows and theres blood on them but then i notice its ketchup then i'm in an air traffic controller tower and am talking to some guy about the planes coming in theres one thats covered in ice and is going to crash in the dream it looked like an iced cube with just the nose and the tips of the wings sticking out wait for details and all the people on the plane were scared then i'm talking to this lady and i say to her why doesnt the pilot simply slowly come in for a landing and just coast on the runway that way hes not ft in the air and wont crash she said his landing gear was frozen then they radio the pilot and tell him to try and land the way i said instead of continuously circling as he may be able to land that way the passengers would live and thered be minimum causalties so he starts trying to land i can hear them screaming then i'm back at the building sweeping the ground and cleaning the blood ketchup off the windows to get ready to leave the woman i used to work with calls me and says shes sending her friend to get me out before this guy finds me and kills me but due to the risk she cant come herself but not to tell anyone then the guy comes into the building and i'm running from him and i see this lady the one i was talking to about the planes pulling up in her car wait details she was on the phone saying to someone my friend and another person that she'd been looking for me for years and years and years i see her pulling up so i try to clean the ketchup spatter off of the windows on the door so she doesnt think i'm nuts and killed someone i dont get this part at all lol then the guy is standing by the door with a knife and i dont want her to come in so i'm trying to think of ways to scare her away so she doesnt come back and get killed she comes into the building and i walk out of the door and put a chain lock on it so the guy cant come out then i run round the corner to try and catch her before she comes in so she doesnt run into him and i was upset because he came to kill me while i was trying to finish preping the building for a party thats all i remember its totally nuts and such a stress dream please laugh over it i did but perhpas provide some insight so i dont have such a crazy one again periodically i have this sort thanks oh yeah forgot they were seperate exits the one i locked with the chain lock and the one she was walking in i locked him in one side of the building by a ramp it resembled a school in design and in a good portion of when i was running from the guy i was in a hallway corridor trying to figure out which exit was the right one to leave out of there were two and one was a dead end and wouldve been a fatal choice as there was no way out from there if that helps at all idk something smart thanks but i dont watch many movies actually didnt watch any t v for quite some time when i had this one and any dreams i have after a night of tv viewing i automtically dismiss but this was creepy its such an obnoxious stress dream i suppose btw thank you for reading the whole thing i rarely post dreams and certainly not this long thumbs up for you thanks for the responses it was just weird is all they guy in the dream idk him irl was trying to kill me but also the other people in the dream as well and its always either this guy says i'm married to him or something along those lines when even in the dream i'm not but he thinks i am and he's always trying to kill me and these others i dont understand this at all i've had maybe or with this same theme over the last few weeks so while the dream may be a stress dream the significance of the on going theme is what i'd like to figure out so perhpas i stop having them thanks for the suggestions and the responses as i know this was long i usually stick right to the details ok so i read the whole thing you answered my dream about my son so now i am going to take a shot at yours i don't know you at all but i will give this a shot you sound like you are a very responsible person and protective in your dream you are protecting the woman with the dangerous boyfriend trying to protect everyone on the plane then protecting the woman from the guy with the knife if i missed something and it's the same guy sorry exit doors is giving a choice one good and one bad you never said which one you took so maybe that means you are fixing to have to make some kind of major decision in your life it was probably one of the longer dreams and i am not one to analyze every detail but that is what i picked up from it  The Inside Social rule United Airlines Flight 93 Avenue Q Aerial (dance move) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an RuneScape

what does it mean to cry in a dream it happens to me like every few weeks let's say or weeks check out this link for a pretty good dream dictionary http www soulfuture com try and notice what else is happening in the dream what other symbols show up for you there are general meanings but symbol meanings vary depending on your experiences for example a black cat may symbolize a bad omen for someone but for the person who loved cared for a black cat they are probably a symbol for something much more positive it might help it you go back to a time in your life that may have caused great pain and ask yourself if you grieved or completely healed from the experience the answers are within you and i feel you are wise enough to put the pieces together thanks for sharing the passage by kahlil gibran i had one of his poetry books in my hand the other day i'll get it for sure next time  Khalil Gibran Grief Alena Dream HyperText Transfer Protocol Care Bears John Berryman Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Scenes from a Memory Socrates Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Amber Spyglass Demon Cliff Richard Prince (artist) End times Simone Weil Dean Koontz The Catcher in the Rye Parsifal Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Jon Secada Theory of conduct Eastern Orthodox Church Breastfeeding Sting (musician) Anarchist symbolism Black Scientology beliefs and practices Zhao Yun Mulholland Drive (film) A Course In Miracles Witchcraft Stomach cancer Lucid dreaming Tai shogi Out-of-body experience Professor X Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Adoption Church of Christ, Scientist Mamoru Chiba One Tree Hill (TV series) Astrology Shogi Carl Jung YuYu Hakusho Gerina Dunwich W.I.T.C.H.

waking up to an odd dream i had an odd dream the other night and i think my dream is telling me something about my feelings i had a dream that i was at work and my manager gave me a paper on the paper was a list of all my friends and my ex and my ex's poem i read it and started crying one of my co workers sat down next to me and gave me a hug it felt so real in my dream that i was really hurt i woke up and i was actually crying i thought it was the strangest experience of a dream is there meaning behind this dream in some way i believe it maybe that i've been hiding some of my feelings of my ex we broke up on good terms but we don't really talk much anymore we have both are so busy w our lives that we barely talk anymore i honestly still miss this person but i realized that we both need to move on i thought i had but this dream seems to tell me otherwise i use to read and study about dreams but i really don't know much about this in my case what does this experience mean according to dreamcrowd to see your friends in your dream signifies aspects of your personality that you have rejected but are ready to integrate these rejected part of yourself the relationships you have with those around you are important in learning about yourself additionally this symbol foretells of happy tidings from them and the arrival of good news to see your childhood friend in your dream signifies regression into your past where you had no responsibilities and things were much simpler and carefree you may be wanting to escape the the pressures and stresses of adulthood consider the relationship you had with this friend and the lessons that were learned alternatively the childhood friend may be suggesting that you have been acting in a childish manner and you need to start acting like an adult to dream that your best friend is dying suggests that some aspect or quality that your best friend possess is dying within your own self to see a lover in your dream symbolizes acceptance self worth and acknowledgement of your true inner value it may also indicate integration of masculine and feminine traits into yourself you are feeling complete or whole to dream of an old or former lover signifies unfinished unresolved issues related to that specific relationship your current relationship may be awakening some of those same issues try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  The Amber Spyglass Jon Secada Infantilism Avenue Q Sigmund Freud Narcissism Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Numerology A Course In Miracles One Tree Hill (TV series) W.I.T.C.H.

is this weird to have dreams about someone in your family dying in front of you it isn't odd it's just what the subconscious is giving you to analyze if you beleive in interpreting dreams death is often not a negative thing in dreams it is more of a transitional symbol to dream about the death of a loved one suggests that you are lacking a certain aspect or quality that the loved one embodies ask yourself what makes this person special or what do you like about him it is that very quality that you are lacking in your own relationship or circumstances alternatively it indicates that whatever that person represents has no part in your own life to see someone dying in your dream signifies that your feelings for that person are dead or that a significant change loss is occurring in your relationship with that person alternatively you may want to repress that aspect of yourself that is represented by the dying person good luck  Numerology Sigmund Freud Reincarnation Infantilism Unconscious mind American Pie (song) Karen Horney Dream Bulgarian language Tarot Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Paul Is Dead God Carl Jung Objectivist philosophy Consciousness Eastern Orthodox Church Royal Assent The Endless Near-death experience John Berryman Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Psychoanalysis Socrates Phaedo Sexual orientation Edgar Cayce Meaning of life Power (sociology) Two's complement Symbol Baptism Force (Star Wars) Characters of The Sandman Asperger syndrome Book of Revelation Lucid dreaming Vowel Polyamory Sign (semiotics) Death Hangul Insurance Marriage Out-of-body experience Goodness and value theory Dead Like Me Trinity The Amber Spyglass Justification (theology) Donnie Darko Probability Hypnosis Hiberno-English Free will Speech synthesis Michel Henry The Smiths Resurrection of Jesus Pedophilia Ancient Greek Narcissism Slavoj __i__ek Zoophilia Animism One Tree Hill (TV series) Clinical depression Endowment (Mormonism) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Sinfest Estoppel LaVeyan Satanism Neon Genesis Evangelion Crimson King Logic Scenes from a Memory Ten Commandments Fictional character Transformation problem Holy Spirit Marilyn Monroe Abortion debate Necrophilia Poker jargon Enneagram Arthur Machen Therianthropy Act of Parliament Artificial consciousness Christian eschatology Physical attractiveness Meaning Autism Evil Mina Mongoose Transactional analysis Jiddu Krishnamurti English grammar Charmed

why do we dream and do they come true dreams are like a letter from the higher self to the conscious mind they awaken us to higher resources of knowledge about ourselves giving us information about what is happening in our daily life and how to meet and move through the problems that face us little in a dream is what it seems to be instead our dreams are filled with symbols that we must interpret puzzles that we are meant to solve  Dream Wheel of Fortune Meaning of life Crossword Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Lucid dreaming Consciousness Sri Aurobindo Sudoku Augustus De Morgan Alcoholics Anonymous Sant Thakar Singh Artificial consciousness Logic Scenes from a Memory Cognitive science Carlos Castaneda Sigmund Freud Out-of-body experience Satya Information Mantra Oneiromancy Mind Jiddu Krishnamurti Human brain Edgar Cayce Creativity Objectivist philosophy Psychology Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix The Life Divine Halting problem Data Mythology Numerology Supernatural Cognition Sathya Sai Baba S__ren Kierkegaard Unconscious mind Mulholland Drive (film) Friedrich Schleiermacher Quantum mind Lost in Translation (poem) A Course In Miracles Scientific method Psychoanalysis Jon Secada Datalore (TNG episode) Ludwig Wittgenstein W.I.T.C.H.

dream ofa haunted house what does it mean to dream im in my grandmas house and its haunted by the ghost of some girl in my school ps it think it is haunted in real life wow evil monkey thanks for creeping me out well you don't say whether the girl from your school is living or not everyone you meet in your dreams represents some aspect of you or your personality unless it is someone who has died in that case it is the spirit of that person trying to get a message to you the house also represents you and the condition of the house is meant to give you some clue to your emotional state the fact that it is haunted would suggest that there is something going in on your life that you don't understand literally something that is hazy or not clearly defined that this is your grandmother's house suggests wiser or more mature aspects of your personality again since this relates to the haunting it seems there is something emtionally about your wiser self that you are dealing with and that you are having trouble figuring out good luck  Animism Pitaten The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Ghostwriter (television series) Dead Like Me Scenes from a Memory Holy Spirit Ghost Storytelling The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Force (Star Wars) Supergirl Asperger syndrome Scientology beliefs and practices John Berryman Umbra (World of Darkness) Spiritism Paul Is Dead The Lovely Bones Apology (Plato) Evil Incarnations of Immortality Obi-Wan Kenobi Picnic at Hanging Rock Infantilism Predestination paradox Meaning of life The Amber Spyglass Oh My Goddess!

top of a hill i had a dream i was kidnapped by guys and was drivin' in a red sports car to their mansion along the way to the house we had to drive up a huge hill an impossible hill to drive up in real life the car struggled to get up the hill but eventually got up it was winter and all the kids were at a mountain tubing down it was snowing but instead of of a blanket of snow on the ground it was actually a blanket a cream coloured blanket i was walking up the mountain but slipped i was sliding down i tried to get a grip on the blanket that was the mountain but it slipped out of my hands i was falling when i woke up it was pretty much a flash of an image rather than a dream but i was standing in the middle of the street and was looking down a huge hill it was like looking from the sky onto earth it was like a normal hill ant like cars were passing below i could see the top of my feet as i looked but it scared me so much i woke up before anything else happened i didn't explain cause i didn't have room so i was wondering why i keep having dreams of weird hills it's made me a bit scared to drive up them in real life what do you think this means i've been having more dreams about hills mountains but i can't seem to remember more no i don't drive up a lt of hills i don't drive but where i live there is basically no hills unless we go into the city i do have fear of heights which probably has something to do with it but i never have dreams about being on top of a building just hills and mountains according to dreamcrowd to dream that you are climbing a hill signifies your struggles in achieving a goal to dream that you are standing on top of a hill signifies that you have succeeded in your endeavors or that you have now have the resources to complete a task at hand try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  Milton H.

stage dreams i had three dreams with a common theme dream i went somewhere to help someone i forgot who and why then arrived at my high school graduation only to have someone tell me i missed it dream all my family and friends are sitting facing a stage i arrive and sit with them and one of my friends is on stage introducing a production which all of us are going to be a part of i'm excited about it because i know i'm going to do a good job i think this took place at a carnival dream i'm on stage looking at a huge outdoor audience i'm supposed to give a speech and it's my high school graduation then this guy tells me i'm on in a few minutes i'm excited because i know my speech is going to be great i look out at the audience get ready to approach the podium but i wake up before i do i dont get to actually talk in front of the audience in any of these dreams and i had a sense of courage and excitement in all three what do you think these dreams mean to dream that you are helping someone indicates your willingness to compromise your beliefs toward a greater accomplishment it also represents your efforts to combine your talents or energies to achieve a mutual goal in particular if you are helping an enemy or someone you do not like then it suggests that you need to come to an understanding or some sort of middle ground in order to move forward and on with your life to dream that you are in school signifies feelings of inadequecy and childhood insecurities that have never been resolved it may relate to anxieties about performance and abilities you may also be going through a spiritual learning experience if you are still in school and dream about school then it will naturally serve as a backdrop to your dream world alternatively a dream that takes place in school may be a metaphor for the lessons that you are learning from your waking life to dream that you are at a graduation represents your achievements and a successful transition to a higher level of ability you are ready to move forward with your accomplishments and do more important things since you missed it perhaps you aren't ready to see your own family in high spirits in your dream symbolizes harmony and happiness to see them gloomy foretells of disappointment and sadness to dream that you are sitting indicates your indecision and not knowing what you want to do with yourself in the near future it may also suggest that you are just being idle and doing nothing to dream that you are at the carnival represents falsehoods and deception if you observe freakish sights then it denotes that there is lack of harmony in your domestic life much sorrow with arise in what were thought to be pleasant times to dream that you are in front of an audience represents the world around you and it is paying close attention to your actions alternatively it suggests your fears of having your personal feelings and private thoughts discovered or revealed is something holding you back from being happy it seems as though every time you're going to do something that excites you the dream goes away  Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Meaning of life Miss Saigon Dream Philosophical skepticism Numerology Lucid dreaming Scenes from a Memory Jon Secada Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Sigmund Freud Out-of-body experience Volleyball Psychoanalysis Jiddu Krishnamurti Goodness and value theory Scientology beliefs and practices Infantilism Magic (illusion) God Emperor of Dune Reiki Summa Theologiae Karen Horney Religion K' Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Phaedo The nature of God in Western theology Force (Star Wars) Alcoholics Anonymous One Tree Hill (TV series) A Course In Miracles W.I.T.C.H.

dating celeberties i keep having dreams where im dating celebrities but there not celebrities when im dating them and like im always incredibly happy in these dreams i've had in the past week but they've been different each time what do they mean according to dreamcrowd sometimes dreaming about a famous actor or actress may be a wish fulfilling dream or it could hold important messages about ourselves we admire celebrities and may wish to have some of their characteristics consider the personality traits or any other trait that attracts you to that person this will help you figure out why you are dreaming about him or her if you are dreaming that someone is acting you may be dreaming about yourself the dream could be pointing out some of the roles that you play in life among the many roles we play are parent spouse lover student professional etc we behave somewhat differently in each of those roles the actor in your dreams could be showing you how well you play some of your roles in life or how others perceive you try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  Social psychology Actor Death of a Salesman Infantilism Cary Grant The Merchant of Venice Japanese name Intelligence quotient Scenes from a Memory Whose Line Is It Anyway?

de ja vu with dreams sometimes i will have a dream but only remember bits and peices of it then about or months later things will happen that happened exactly in the dream and it will bring me back to that dream does anyone have an explaination for this the last one i had was about a week or two ago i got in touch with a friend that i hadn't hung out with for about four years we decided to go to his house and watch a movie and when we pulled up to his house i remembered a dream i had months earlier that involved me hanging out with him and we were at his house well the house that we pulled up to was the exact house that was in my dream yard and all it freaked me out the experience of d j vu is usually accompanied by a compelling sense of familiarity and also a sense of eeriness strangeness or weirdness the previous experience is most frequently attributed to a dream although in some cases there is a firm sense that the experience genuinely happened in the past d j vu has been described as remembering the future the experience of d j vu seems to be very common in formal studies of people report having experienced it at least once references to the experience of d j vu are also found in literature of the past indicating it is not a new phenomenon it has been extremely difficult to invoke the d j vu experience in laboratory settings therefore making it a subject of few empirical studies recently researchers have found ways to recreate this sensation using hypnosis we have all some experience of a feeling that comes over us occasionally of what we are saying and doing having been said and done before in a remote time of our having been surrounded dim ages ago by the same faces objects and circumstances of our knowing perfectly what will be said next as if we suddenly remember it  Out-of-body experience D__j__ vu Abduction Phenomenon Scenes from a Memory Lucid dreaming Milton H.

what does stroking mean in a dream i keep having this dream that someone i hate is stroking my hair and that i'm calm with it all depends on the level of hate and cause of it hate is like cancer it is most likely interfering w your spirit so spirit conscience is sending you a message to calm the hate that you say 'keep having' is a good stage for a surreal dream you know this is not real when this person messes with you and you don't react with hate watch for such an unreal event when it happens let that trigger your mind to know it's just a dream and zzz fill in the blank suggestions grab persons hand and ax them what would make things right with us or what would get under their skin the most remember you are in control because you recognized a trigger that it was just a dream and pulled that trigger this will cause you to start to wake so do not wake stay asleep or go right back to sleep thinking of where you left off  Lucid dreaming Dream Urinary incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hypnosis The Amber Spyglass Social rule Out-of-body experience Kodocha EastEnders Hulk (comics) Consciousness Miss Saigon Avenue Q Cigarette Smoking Man Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Oh My Goddess!

do you think there are really deep meanings in every dream i never gave much thought about it before but i stumbled upon this section and i was wondering if everyone thought that every dream has some deep meaning if you do then what does it mean if you do not remember your dreams and or do not have them i think dreams often reflect your subconscious issues are they all very deep not so much most of the time i think dreams reflect common things like anxiety about tests love relationships taxes etc the experiences are common and pretty mundane most of the time but are still very emotionally charged and intense for everyone each time we experience them however people do have dreams with deep content reflecting spiritual growth as well both types of dreams are interesting to look at in my opinion and both types of dreams are important and valid to study many people do not remember their dreams after waking but most people dream part of the reason we think we don't dream is because dreams are very ephemeral and once we awaken we begin to fill our conscious mind with the mundane thoughts of waking life after we start thinking about the day ahead it's hard to remember our dreams unless we've really made a habit of doing so remembering dreams is actually a skill that can be learned and requires practice just like any other skill additionally use of alcohol and sleep drugs dampens the ability to dream so people who regularly use sleep aids otc or drugs alcohol may in fact inhibit their rem sleep and dream ability and overall sleep quality  Lucid dreaming Out-of-body experience Dream Narcolepsy Consciousness Sleep Alexander Technique Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Unconscious mind Hypnosis Edgar Cayce Neurofeedback Human Human sexual behavior Psychosis Psychoanalysis Carl Jung Cannabis (drug) Milton H.

i have this reoccuring dream i havent had this dream for a few years but i had it recently me and my friend alycia were standing outside an old apartment i lived in for years of my childhood the next door neightbors who i knew to be good people kidnapped alycia i went to go save her and they put me in a cage hanging from a tree in their backyard why does this dream reoccur and why does it choose to come up again after about years i had this dream a lot about years ago most dreams contain messages that serve to teach us something about ourselves unfortunately many a times we forget what we dream about as we go about our daily routine with recurring dreams the message may be so important and or powerful that it just will not go away the frequent repetition of such dreams forces you to pay attention and confront the dream the dream is trying desperately to tell you something such dreams are often nightmarish or frightening in their content which also helps you to take notice and pay attention to them recurring dreams are quite common and are often triggered by a certain life situation or a problem that keeps coming back again and again these dreams may recur daily once a week or once a month but whatever the frequency there is little variation in the dream content itself it usually points to a personal weakness fear or your inability to cope with something in your life past or present the repetitive patterns in your dream can reveal some of the most valuable information on yourself it may point to a conflict situation or matter in your waking life that remains unresolved or unsettled or some urgent underlying message in your unconscious is demanding to be understood following are some tips in overcoming your recurring dreams in understanding your recurring dream you must be willing to accept some sort of change or undergo a transformation you must be willing to look within yourself and confront whatever you may find no matter how difficult it my be you must be able to look at the dream from an objective point of view try to get pass the emotional and reactive elements of the dream and get down to the symbolic images many times dreams are masked by elements that are disturbing preventing you to delve any deeper this is a defense mechanism that your unconscious may be putting up be patient do not get discourage if these dreams still recur even after you thought you have come to understand them learn to accept yourself truly and fully often times once you discover what your recurring dream is trying to tell you these dreams will change or altogether disappear  Scientology beliefs and practices Sigmund Freud Traumatic incident reduction Infantilism Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Carl Jung Autism Transsexuality Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Clinical depression Karen Horney Internet troll Artificial consciousness Stuttering Lucid dreaming Scenes from a Memory Miss Saigon Daredevil Alexander Technique Children of Dune Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Social psychology Meaning of life Sin City Second language acquisition Milton H.

why is it that in dreams sometimes ur friends personality is that of another ex i had a dream the other night that my best friend genesis was kidnapped for some reason she was in another of my not so close friends isabella's body but she still acted like herself why is it that sometimes in dreams u see someone else's personality in someone yet u still call them by their name cuz i was calling her genesis even though i knew it was isabellas body why does this happen according to dreamcrowd our dreams are full of symbolism with their messengers being all different types of people it is very common to dream about our friends these are individual that are emotionally valuable to us and we learn about ourselves through them dreams are very rarely prophetic thus whether your dream was good or bad don't expect it to come true this dream is more than likely attempting to bring up uncomfortable feelings that you have about yourself or others remember uncomfortable does not necessarily mean bad dreams are created by our own thinking processes our own thoughts conscious or unconscious create dreams thus the mind that created the dream also knows its meaning see also people to dream that you are dreaming signifies your emotional state you are excessively worried and fearful about a situation or circumstance that you are going through to dream that darkness comes upon you signifies failure in work you may attempt darkness is synonymous with ignorance the unconscious evil death and fear of the unknown if the sun breaks through the darkness then you will overcome your failures if you feel safe in the dark then it suggests that you like not knowing about certain things as some might say ignorance is bliss to dream that you cannot find someone in the darkness signifies that you need to keep your temper in check you have the tendency to let your emotions get out of control and lose your temper to dream that you are lost in the darkness denotes feelings of desperation depression or insecurity to dream that you are groping around in the darkness indicates that you have insufficient information to make a clear decision do your research and do not rush into making choices try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Jon Secada Out-of-body experience One Tree Hill (TV series) Sigmund Freud The Amber Spyglass Psychoanalysis Unconscious mind Milton H.

dream about dead person i had this dream about a girl i knew who is now dead but she appeared in my dream i was just walking with my friends this is in my dream and she was just walking right there next to us so i turned to my friends and said omg its kate and they got mad at me and said why are you talking about her don't talk about her and i asked them if they could see her but they couldn't i was the only one who could see her but then i took my friend's hand and brought it closer to kate's and my friend could feel her hand but she couldn't see her what does this mean well i have had those similar dreams but they were about my pets anyway i think that that means that your friends have forgotten about her and remember her just barely beccause they could feel her hands and to you it might mean that you should keep her close because she will keep you close always  Shaggy dog story Knots Landing Jon Secada Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The Amber Spyglass Cliff Richard EastEnders Avenue Q Friends The Shining (film) W.I.T.C.H.

what causes a reoccuring person in your dreams over the last almost yrs now i have had dreams of the same person its someone i have never met in person these dreams are very emotional and when i wake i can still feel the impact from them for weeks and weeks and it cause me to withdraw into myself feelings of hurt seperation also come from this they are not everyday dreams but happen often threw out every year it started when i was in my middle teens and now i am in my middle 's just curious as to the cause of them according to dreamcrowd it is very common to dream about all kinds of faces strange faces and familiar faces alike are frequent images in our dreams interpret your dream by considering the face and the general content of the dream a stranger's face could represent different parts of your personality or psyche you think that you are seeing a stranger but in actuality you are seeing a different part of yourself jung said that the stranger is a part of you that comes from the unconscious a comic face may indicate that you have a conscious or unconscious need to mock or snub the conventional featureless faces suggest that you may feel unnoticed and unappreciated on the other hand some believe that the blank or unclear face represents a teacher that is someone who is there to show and teach you a lesson but you are unprepared for it and the face is blank smiling faces are representative of happy thoughts and feelings and possibly anticipation of a joyful event in the near future always remember the compensatory nature of dreams and their ability to point to the opposite of what you experience in daily life try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  Dream Carl Jung Consciousness Unconscious mind Sigmund Freud The Giver Shaggy dog story Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Lucid dreaming Milton H.

do people deaf from birth have dreams with sounds i remember reading somewhere but i don't remember where that deaf people do not have dreams with sounds the article said that your dreams are comprised of what you experience in life everyday instead a deaf person would dream mostly visually without sounds because he has never experienced sounds before where people like us would hear spoken voices in dreams he would probably dream of sign language because that is what he is probably used to seeing everyday likewise a blind person from birth cannot see but he can hear so he would only dream in sounds smells touch not pictures while people like us who can both hear and see our dreams are comprised of both pictures and sounds i am not completely sure how correct this article is but it makes sense to me  Hearing impairment Deaf culture Deaf Deafblindness Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Sign language Manually Coded English Aphasia Philosophical skepticism Tactile signing Auslan Models of deafness Music British Sign Language Synaesthesia American Sign Language Signing Exact English Jon Secada The Miracle Worker Lucid dreaming Milton H.

i keep dreaming about goldfish anyone know why last night was the third time in a month that i have had a goldfish dream and in every one of them at least one fish has died anyone got any ideas what this might mean possibly you have suffered a loss and you are processing the grief in your dream in a way that is managable for you the word gold in goldfish may mean you have lost something that was golden to you often dream images are a play on words gold is something precious and valuable the word fish could represent a pet or for some it is a christian symbol or it could just be metaphor for swimming in something etc water often represents feelings or emotions water in a fish bowl could mean you are keeping your emotions tightly contained  Goldfish Aquarium American Dad!

why would kurt cobain's spirit talk to me i know this is strange and anyone can say whatever they want but i have been talking to the spirit of kurt cobain for quite a while now i know i have asked the question how can i speak to kurt cobain but i meant how can i see him face to face i have listened to nirvana and played their songs for a very long time now okay like i said i've been going through a pretty harsh lifestyle i also kurt went through a lot as well i know what i go through now and have been going through he has been there as well i contacted him through evp and told him all of this and i talk to him like that i never bother him about his music or his death only talking to him and asking him about myself and coping with my life i have asked him many times if i will ever see him he never responds to that i just want to know why would he choose to talk to me over anyone else i mean i care about him not as a fan but as a person who went through it the same as he did no one ever beleives me if this spiritual voice is coming to you to seek closure for cobain since he left unfinished business i would ask him how can you help this spirit to have closure it could be to forgive and give him to god so he can move on or contact courtney love or someone else who might still need to forgive so he can move on or work with teen suicide prevention or recovery groups if that would help him feel he is resolving the ill problems he escaped by suicide and left unresolved i would guess that you and he share some karma and you are not meant to take his path but to resolve issues instead so he can have closure by bringing resolution and healing through you if this is a muse that is inspiring you to study certain music or explore yourself then just use it that way it could be an angel or a demon if it is not at peace and still disconnected or in conflict with some unresolved or unforgiven issue on a personal note please don't feel bad i have had experiences channeling past life poets writers politicians spiritual prophets etc who seem to use me as an editor or typsetter for their messages they want to share i think these are divine but some friends are concerned that these not be abused to be demonic so i have to be careful what the message is my whole website is filled with these writings so i plan to publish these and share with other people and show it does not have to be a negative weird or scary thing i want to use these ideas for good not to cause problems it makes sense to me that people share a collective conscience and we have soulmates in this life as well as beyond so of course our thoughts and feelings are connected it's just a matter of who we are close to if you share karma or spiritual connection with this angel or soul or whatever spirit is communicating with you then just use the interaction and message to bring healing for good purpose and there is nothing wrong with that if nothing else i see nothing wrong with contacting either a spiritual research group who might document your case as a study or even try writing an article about it for a magazine or journal try contacting the association for research and enlightenment edgar cayce or any carl jung center or buddhist group if you are troubled by this i would consult with either a monk or even the dalai lama is open to receiving requests for counseling or questions he helped to identify richard gere's past life connections so maybe you have a purpose like that if so he may want to help if you look up dr weiss there is a whole following of people doing psychological research on past life regressions and counseling so maybe you can find a local counselor who works on that level so you are lucky today there are more people studying and researching this seriously than before if you want to see some of the writings i have channeled political http www houstonprogressive org letters html http www houstonprogressive org isocracy html my constitutional rants and ravings come by dictation which i attribute to the same muses who inspired either jefferson or george mason or the founding fathers who prayed extensively before writing down the founding documents i normally cannot stand politics or religion so these long essays on church and state used to stress me out but i have learned to forgive and accept and try to make sure the idea is constructive and not negative or anti government shakespeare moliere http www houstonprogressive org jr index html whatever karma i have with nine inch nails http www houstonprogressive org

can someone tell me if they know whats going on with me ok i know this is going to sound incredible werid to most of you but it the truth most of the time when i dream i see little clips of thing that are completly relistic ex a pic of a tea kettle or somethimes i even see like movie type thing ex me and my friend in a park walking seeing dogs and certain trees well from a day to a month period i see all of the things i see in the clips does any one else do this cause its been happening for a couple of years now and iam a little freaked out about it help please don't be afraid you may have a gift for seeing and remembering images that are ahead of time the explanation i have heard for this is that all human thought and perception as a form of energy is connected over time and space as one continuum comparable to a movie script at any point in time it is possible to perceive images thoughts or perceptions even if outside the present or current lifetime that is why people have past life impressions or can remember more if they are hypnotized or regressed they are assumed to be tapping into the memories of people who lived before who are connected like soulmates and can feel each other's thoughts over time in your case you may be seeing images in advance memories of the past or future that are coming to you in dreams again please don't be afraid but try to find books or exercises that can help you to develop your skills or apply them in a way that is beneficial i have a friend who helps counsel people to heal because she can see into their pasts what has not been forgiven and needs to be released before they can move on it seems you have a spiritual gift of vision so keep a positive mindset and try to use it for good  Out-of-body experience Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Philosophical skepticism Scenes from a Memory Reincarnation The nature of God in Western theology David Hume Neuro-linguistic programming Jon Secada A Course In Miracles Scientology beliefs and practices Philosophy of perception Hypnosis Science fiction film Milton H.

recurring dream of bloody and dirty public bathrooms this is a dream that i have had in the past several time and just had again the other night in my dream i walk into a public bathroom that looks like a locker room there are about doors i start opening each one looking for a clean place to do my business however every door i open the toilet is full with water and there is blood and other dirty things so then i go to the next the door and the same thing in some dreams i find the least dirty bathroom and do my business and in other dreams i never find a place to go i know this is weird but any help would be great because of the way this dream makes me feel i consider it a bad dream i like to remind everyone that nobody can really interpret your dreams better than you can but i can give you some things to think about that might help you make sense of this unnusual dream everything in a dream is a symbol the fact that you are walking is a strong symbol for you moving along your life journey having a need to enter the bathroom and then finding it in the condition that you describe these suggest that you are blocking yourself by hanging on to negative emotions or a negative experience blood is a strong symbol and suggests you may be draining your own energy through worry or fear the color red is symbol for energy so what's it all mean well i dunno but i would not be surprised if you haven't figured it out by now there is something going on in your life that is creating worry in you and you are letting that worry have too much say it may be a very small thing or it certainly could be something large like moving starting a new school or job by letting go of the anxiety your energy should come back and this particular dream should stop good luck  The Shining (film) Toilet One Tree Hill (TV series) K' Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Out-of-body experience Anxiety Sin City Piccolo Junior Saga Social rule Changeroom Friends Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Toilet humour Fecal incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Traumatic incident reduction Shit Infantilism EastEnders The Inside Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Japanese toilet Conker's Bad Fur Day Pitaten Urinary incontinence W.I.T.C.H.

if you dream about certain things over and over what does it mean to dream about snakes since i was a little girl and alligators since years ago over and over again the alligators are in my dream and are trying to bite me and sometimes i know i had a dream about them but i can't remember what about yes i am afraid of these animals hi lissy you have hit on one of my interests which is dream interpretation i have a book that i use whenever i want to know what one of my dreams mean and i just looked up your question about dreaming about snakes and alligators and this is what i found it is under the heading attack by wild animals although the reason may be unclear you are threatened chased or attacked by a wild animal the culprit may be an alligator bear lion tiger shark wild dog any creature really the common thread in this dream is the ferociousness and single mindedness with which the animal approaches you the encounter spikes your adrenaline you wake up awash in anxiety and fear this dream like the one of monsters hiding in the closet is extremely common in childhood although it can recur in adulthood as well wild animals are clear metaphors for the unconscious urges inside all of us often as you contemplate the plot of the dream you realize that the focus of your fear seems not to be the physical danger but that you're in such close proximity to something unpredictable that can't be controlled in this way the dream is often about the fear of harboring and keeping in check anything that would be considered uncultivated social or sexual behavior for children wild animal dreams serve as a type of placeholder symbol for any new worries or stresses that need processing although the habitual appearance of specific animals in your dreams might hint at deeper symbolism the type of animal that attacks you is perhaps less significant than the behavior it exhibits in the dream dream expert gayle delaney recommends taking a moment to consider the personality and behavior of the animal did it appear with deadly stealth out of nowhere or stomp and growl announcing itself from miles away was it possible to communicate with this animal or was it not responsive asking these questions might help you equate the dream behavior with a similar experience you're having with a person or situation in waking life this is from me most of the time dream interpretation is just that interpretation since it is from your subconscious only you can really figure out and understand what is going on in your life that would cause you to have this dream a lot of times once you can figure out whatever it might be in your life that needs attention once you do whatever you need to do the dream will stop if you in fact have something that needs attending to the dream itself is like a spotlight on it to get your attention over the years i have found that sometimes i actually know in my dream that i am dreaming and can actually participate in my dream as an observer i don't really know how i do it but the next time you are having this dream try to tell yourself that you are just dreaming and then see if you can try to talk to the animal to see what it wants if you can do this you just might be able to find out what it is your subconscious is trying to tell you i hope that this helps  Infantilism Autism Milton H.

interesting dream help me interpret it please i had a dream the other night where i died but it wasn't a normal death dream no way let me elaborate i dreamed that some people and i all had to die for some great cause but we'd only be dead for a year don't know the cause but we all agreed to it the people with me were the kids i went to elementary school with only they were grown up now we died by entering a classroom trailer outside of my high school the lady organizing it told us once we walked in we would be dead but i didn't quite believe this was true as people don't die by entering classrooms so i walked in but nothing happened but before i turned back around all the colors became much more vibrant and all of our eyes turned light green signifying that we had died it was a wonderful feeling but i was worried because i hadn't told my mother i was going to be dead for a year so i started freaking out because i didn't want her to be sad so i was a little afraid of the lady organizing it but a friend suggested i use my camcorder to send my mom a video of me made perfect since in my dream so i go to the bathroom to make the video and the girl's restroom was full of urinals and the sinks full of sand but the stalls were alright i go in the stall to make the video but i realize my purse had spilt and there was two of everything i owned all over the floor then i returned to the classroom and we just stayed there i grew closer to my classmates to where we were all friends and the experience of death was wonderful but what could this mean what a great dream wanting to make a video leads me to believe that you have had someone close that has died when my mother died all i wanted was just to be able to call her the colors becoming more vibrant sounds like insight into what could happen one thing that i think our minds do while asleep is figure out problems and death is certainly a problem you seem to want to be prepared for it and i find that remarkable for you to dream about you must be a responsible person also the bathroom with urinals and sand bring the image of a sand clock the kind you turn over to start again very good symbol for time running out of course it could represent growing up since your childhood friends were there  Shaggy dog story Paul Is Dead Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Shining (film) The Amber Spyglass One Tree Hill (TV series) Jon Secada The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Marilyn Monroe Futurama (TV series - season 2) Milton H.

please help me interpret this dream i think i am having premonitons which i have been having for i guess a year now my nanna died two years ago this november and then my poppy died nine months later in july please help me interpret this dream because when i went to a web site they could'nt fully interpret it i was in my omi and opa's house but instead my poppy was sitting where my opa sits usually then all my family was there asking my poppy how florida is and etc then i looked over at my poppy and i saw a person who looked like my nanna and was holding a black cross i screamed poppy what is that sadly no one else saw it so i glance over at the tv and something is there it had one blue eye and one brown eye this person did not look like my nanna and had blonde curly hair she looked aged s maybe i screamed again and sadly again no one else saw it so i looked again and it was gone so then i looked over my poppy and there it was again i grabbed her hand she told me her name was linda and that my nanna wanted her to sorry couldn't finish it not enough room so as it continues come and talked to me in a calm peaceful voice she told me your nanna loves you and your poppy is going to be happy now and then i woke up when i woke up i was crying for some reason two days later i found out my poppy died please be serious about this and the really weird part was that my nanna was buried holding a black cross please help me you have no idea how much this is appreciated thank you for your time and hopefully your answer what does this dream mean please do not answer with dreammoods i was there when the dream first happened and they did not answer my question at all we were veryyy close my nanna was like my best friend so was my poppy actually come to think of it my nanna's best friend's name is linda but she doesn't look like the one in my dream and my nanna was only when she passed away wow i am adding a lot of extra details lol but if any one of you has any more info on this dream and you already answered my question but you also had a few questions and i was a little unclear please e mail me asap last extra detail normally this wouldn't be very confusing but to someone that is just a preteen me it is really confusing please help i'm terribly sorry about your nanna and poppy did you happen to see that black cross with your nanna before like did she use to carry it around with her bits and pieces of your memories usually end up in a dream together as for linda she could be a representation of death obviously but not like the grim reaper do you know anybody named linda she's like an angel here to tell you that everything is okay she's like a messenger she could also have been a friend of your nanna if you knew a linda or if your nanna was around i remember having elderly neighbors the old lady died and then the old man was left alone it's definitely hard when you are old and lost the one that you truly loved so i mean i'm not saying your poppy's death shouldn't have happened that soon but it's hard to deal with old age and losing your wife at the same time so maybe it could have been a coincidence which is a word i hate to use especially with dreams that your dream and the death happened at the same time  Shaggy dog story Scenes from a Memory The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Pitaten Dead Like Me Marilyn Monroe The Amber Spyglass God Emperor of Dune Little Britain Theory of conduct Knots Landing The Shining (film) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 2) House of M Blood on the Tracks Time Out of Mind The Inside Avenue Q Meaning of life Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mary Poppins Piccolo Junior Saga Reservoir Dogs Jon Secada Jean Grey Miss Saigon Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Methos Kasparov versus The World "Weird Al" Yankovic Salad Fingers Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Father's Day (Doctor Who) The Pilgrim's Progress Kurt Cobain The Ashlee Simpson Show RuneScape quests Mojave people K' StarCraft: Uprising Humphrey Bogart She Loves You Insane Clown Poppy The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Social rule Waking the Dragons Night (book) Philosophical skepticism Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Blonde on Blonde Rei Ayanami Theodicy Paul Is Dead W.I.T.C.H.

wierd re occuring dreams well i've been having the same type of dreams as long as i've been alive it's kinda strange i think i alway have dreams of me falling off of buildings bridges stairs or sometimes railing of buildings bridges stairs well fall off and cause me to fall sometimes stairs will collapse under me why do i alway have dreams such as this xd in of my dreams this happens and i get this wierd numbing tickly feeling when i fall i may want to add that i'm scared of heights according to dreamcrowd this is a common dream which usually represents underlying fears and feelings of inadequacy and helplessness interpret your dream by considering your primary fears current difficulties and situations in your life that seem to be on a downward spiral especially those situations that seem outside of your control financial romantic etc some people believe that if you keep falling in your dream and don't wake up that you will die at the point of impact this is absolutely not true in a falling dream you wake up out of fear and not because of danger of dying superstition based dream interpretations say that if you fall a long distance in your dream and get hurt be prepared for really hard times ahead but if you fall and are not injured your upsets will be minor and temporary try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  Stairway Dream Out-of-body experience Philosophical skepticism Deflation (economics) Lucid dreaming Blood (computer game) 2005 Kashmir earthquake A Course In Miracles Seismic retrofit Asian financial crisis The Shining (film) Diving Air-raid shelter Milton H.

why do dreams make you do whatever you want in my dreams i do things that i usually would not do in real life i am not sure the specifics of your dreams but dreams in general are easy to understand if you take time to think about them our spirits or hearts never sleep only our bodies need rest what is inside our bodies our personalities our spirits never need sleep with this said as our bodies sleep our spirits keep doing things and going places when we wake up if we remember what our spirits were doing we call those experiences dreams dreams are good if you are dealing with things you like and not so nice if you are dealing with situations that you don't like every dream may not have meaning but as we understand more about dreams the more we can explain i hope this helps if you want to discuss this more i do except email see profile  Lucid dreaming Dream Animism Jon Secada The nature of God in Western theology Scientology beliefs and practices Theory of conduct Sleep A Course In Miracles Out-of-body experience Holy Spirit Socrates Carlos Castaneda Reincarnation Current teachings of Prem Rawat The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Paranoia Agent Narcolepsy Near-death experience Ekadasi Justification (theology) Care Bears Transactional analysis Umbra (World of Darkness) Soul Scenes from a Memory Supernatural The Book of Five Rings Reality Nocturnal emission Haibane Renmei Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Social psychology Turiya The Shining (film) Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Astral projection Insomnia The Pilgrim's Progress Parsifal Avenue Q Dissociative identity disorder Cliff Richard Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Aikido Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Mantra Artificial consciousness W.I.T.C.H.

what does water symbolize in a dream i have dreams with lakes oceans rivers in them and in the dreams the water always frightens me what does it symbolize yes in reality i do know how to swim and i am a good swimmer p s i have read the y a archives on this question and i didnt like the answers any new ideas strange the water may symbolise something else what do you fear maybe your mind mixes what you fear with what you love when you are dreaming so that it appears that you are afraid of water when maybe you are afraid of change since water is always flowing and never sits still  Paranoia Agent Dream Lucid dreaming Swimming Lake Symbol Milton H.

k somebody has to help me out here k i've had this weird dream that i'm walking with my grandpa around the garden an suddenly the dream shifts from us walking to two color changeing snake haveing a conversation about how they want to kill us and then it shifts back to me and him walking around the garden again i see them comeing towards us and then we are suddenly on the other side of the property jumping over the fence and just as we're about to get into the house my grandpa gets bitten by one of the snakes and pushes me inside the house where there are color changeing frogs everywhere and then i wake up i'm not afraid of snakes and know this isn't normal specially when i've had it times in a row i'm not eating or drinking anything before bed so i don't know what it is could somebody please shed some light on this very strange dream because i have no idea what it means my grandpa's not even dead so i dunno first of all the garden represents the things that you cultivate in your life or the moral or immoral things you practice on a daily basis the two snake represent deceptions which have come against you and the reason they change color is to camouflage themselves to decieve you jumping over the fence represents crossing over or a hedge of protection against the deceit being bit by the snake represents falling under the influence of the deception frogs represents unclean demons which camouflage to hide their intentions against you you dreams sounds like you are in spiritual warfare and god is warning you that their is danger all around you it looks like god is showing you that when you crossed over the fence at that point you were free from the deception which was trying to over take you now you are confronted with a different type of spirit frogs are associated with things which try to take away your peace  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Milton H.

weird dream okay this is really funny so you should read the whole thing okay so it started off i walked into my house that i lived in as a child and when i opened the front door the door stopped because it hit the coffee table i looked behind the door and there was my mom and my brother counting fruit loops it was the wierdest dream i had ever had not too long after that i had a dream that there was this big giant red barn and i walked into it and there was like a lot of dogs hanging by clothespins by their tails on clotheslines isnt that weird if anyone thinks they know what any of this means let me know i think it depends primarily on the emotional or contemplative state you were in prior to sleeping how was your day that day take the barn dream for example what was your reaction to seeing the dogs on the clothe lines during the dream were you shocked did you seem like you were almost required to free them from the clotheslines usually when i have strange dreams it somehow relates to a fear or anxiety i was facing earlier in the day the first dream mentioned sounds like it was relating to a sense of nostalgia or family your brother and mother were there doing a mundane activity requiring cooperation together walking into your old house might represent a sense of longing or something similar i'm no dream expert but that's my best guess  Shaggy dog story Out-of-body experience Dean Koontz Dog Doug Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Egyptian language Fire fighting Garfield RuneScape quests The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Brady Bunch EastEnders God Emperor of Dune W.I.T.C.H.

weird dream i just had a weird dream but it's freaking me out recently my house was broke into so i'm not sure if bits of it was from anxiety of what happened but here we go i was dreaming that i was dying no one was trying to kill me or anything but my dad was in it and he was telling me all this stuff that he's sorry he couldn't be a better father and all this basically he was apologizing for sucking as a dad but it's not that he is a wonderful father but anyways it then cuts to me being raped but i wasn't being raped at the time it was like i was watching myself being raped and what's crazy is it was my doctor who was doing it i don't know it was weird i then woke up soon after that is this just some silly nightmare or what please interpret my dream thanks the rape in my dream is actually a little weird i could understand people dreaming about that if it happened to them in some point of their life however i have never been raped the only thing i can think of is i'm having anxiety of being raped by what happened when someone broke into my house along with the anxiety of possibly being dead at this moment although nothing bad happened to me then it still scares me that it could happen thanks for the answers guys this dream has everything to do with your house being broken into you dreaming you were dying represents your vulnerability and that a piece of you is missing which is your sence of security your father was there to apologize because we look to our fathers for protection which he did not or could not provide for you and therefor he feels he did not live up to his fatherly duty as protector your doctor represents trust which was breached as your home was breached you being raped is not a sexual representation but you feel violated by this intruder the doctor being the one raping you means that you think someone you know and trusted broke into your home thereby violating your trust even more this is a manifestation of your belief not a fact i hope this makes sense and i hope it helps sweeter dreams in the future  Theory of conduct Father's Day (Doctor Who) Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Grandview, U.S.A.

would you like to enjoy one of my bizzare dreams i have dreams like this every night but i took the liberty of writing this one down as soon as i woke up while it was still fresh in my memory and i swear i don't use drugs my cousin wanted me to drop her off at the mall on my way somewhere we drove from her house after i dropped her off i suddenly had a white bag full of groceries i was carrying over my shoulders not only that but my deaf mute aunt was taking my groceries from me i yelled at her in sign language and she got into a van and drove off i wanted to chase her but for some reason it took me an eternity to put my key into the ignition and i could see her driving by trees gradually gaining distance finally i got the car to work and drrove over sidewalks and grassy hills to catch up with her as i was speeding down a sidewalk i noticed a cop car and was sure he would try to stop me but out of nowhere a brown horse reared up and must've caught the officers attention because they didn't give chase brb so as i'm driving i noticed my car had beome a bicycle and there were police searching houses i pulled over and asked what was happening to a couple of officers they didn't say much but i thought they were lying i rode on and came to a bridge that turned the road into a swamp i had to climb up a series of trees mixed with pavement to get passed that point as i was climbing a fat anaconda tried biting my hands i took a closer look and noticed although it was very wide it was only about a foot and a half long and it had fangs i tried grabbing it behind its head but it was very strong and still managed to barely bite me so i started to smash it against rocks while looking for something to stab it with suddenly it slithered away and a beautiful neon blue light radiated from the direction the snake went then i woke up i always have dreams like that they're usually pretty funny when i look back at them  Professional wrestling throws Knots Landing Reservoir Dogs Shaggy dog story Vehicular cycling Professional wrestling holds The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Sin City The Inside Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Escape from New York Transportation of Los Angeles Drag racing Grand Theft Auto (game) Paul Is Dead Milton H.

can you explain my dream i had a strange dream i was over a my boyfriend and he had a girl that he work with and he told me that his going to sleep in the same bed as her and i got the couch and in my dream i didn't care just walked out and told his sister that i am breaking up with him as i left i smiled did you like the smile do you want to break up with him and felt relieved to have a good reason to do it before he dumped you were you smiling because now he is her problem lol or were you smiling because you saw what needed to be done and felt pride in yourself that you had the courage to do it so well or something else now take the feelings out of the dream scenario and put them where you think they best fit in real life do you have a difficult decision to make about something that will alter your life in a big way perhaps your dream is telling you to choose the answer that takes courage and tough love or maybe it is telling you to generally trust in your own personal strength you will be able to make the choices that make you feel pride in yourself or maybe g d forbid it is a premonition i don't hold to that personally but some folks do if you need to ask any questions of your boyfriend in order to feel more secure then just remember how you reacted in your dream if there is a problem drop it like you mean it and say it with a smile  W.I.T.C.H.

last night i dreamt i went to this event wedding or something this woman wore the same evening dress as mine its a lilac dress with silver diamontes and beads all over it which i actually really do have in real life packed away in a box this woman in my dream wore the exact same dress as mine and i mean exact was almost like she deliberately wore the same the only difference was hers was a light pink colour mine was lilac so because she wore the same i remember feeling annoyed in the dream so she got changed into something else i'm not stupid and realise that dreams always end up meaning more to what you think it means it never ends up meaning the obvious like this doesn't mean in real life that when i wear this dress sometime in the future that some woman is going to end up wearing the exact same dress too cause that just sounds silly this definitely has a whole other different meaning behind it anyone think they might know i have no idea why my dreams are so weird why on earth i'd dream of this beautiful dress which i actually do have packed away in a box i do not know lol it could mean you arent comfortable with a certain life decision and wish you had chosen this 'pink dress'  Eric Cartman God Emperor of Dune Japanese tea ceremony Avenue Q Clothing Kate Bush Code: Lyoko Monty Python Marie Antoinette Little Britain Futurama (TV series - season 5) Cliff Richard Boy Scouts of America EastEnders The Marriage of Figaro Whose Line Is It Anyway?

what does my dream mean ok so last night i had this dream that i was in this room that was supposedly mine but it was detached from the main house like some sort of casita it was well lit and looked like any normal teenagers room the problem was i couldn't lock the doors because i didn't have the keys to the room anyways it was nighttime i was watching the movie 'brokeback mountain' which baffles me even more and i was kind of scared because my doors weren't locked and it was pitch black outside though it was well lit inside suddenly there happened to be security guards outside and there were robbers getting away with stuff at the neighbors house with the security guards doing nothing about it what does all this mean i am gay in the closet but i really have no intention on watching brokeback mountain hmm well this is just speculation but maybe you feel that you have a guilty pleasure or something that you hide from other people brokeback mountain and the normal room and you are constantly afraid that someone somehow the darkness will find out unlocked room or you are exposed too much and that regarding this or something else you see crimes happening all the time even though the police and government do not seem to intervene security guards and robbers if this regards the first part of the dream then maybe it's the crime of society forcing you to hide whatever you are hiding this is what i can see right now as far as you describe your dream or perhaps it was just a random dream that has no significance and is just showing your imagination of my dreams are like that  Shaggy dog story StarCraft: Uprising Changeroom Sin City Bad Wolf Blood (computer game) Perfect Dark Columbine High School massacre Surveillance RuneScape quests The Brady Bunch Milton H.

can someone please tell me what my dream means i had a dream that i was sitting on the toliet really and the door was really low so all these guys came up to the stall i was in and keep on staring in on me and peeping in and it seemed like i kept on trying to hide something that was in the toliet it is super embarrissing lol but i just want to know what it means because it was sooo weird thanks hmmm that's a little different but there are some familiar elements so i think i can take a reasonable shot the toilet is usually associated with the dreamer's emotional state i would suggest that the dream indicates that you are concerned with people seeing your emotional secrets you may feel like people or a specific person are getting to close to some emotional truths you are working hard to hide those truths but you are feel exposed and potentially vulnerable has someone new entered your life or have you been opening up to someone or thought of opening up to someone dreams are often resolved by confronting the issue in your waking state facing your emotions or opening up to someone else may help you resolve the dream for more info i suggest checking http dreammoods com best of luck  Lucid dreaming Toilet Dream God Emperor of Dune Scenes from a Memory Sin City Obi-Wan Kenobi Domestic violence The Cure Plame affair Social rule Self-harm Homophobia The Amber Spyglass Surveillance One Tree Hill (TV series) The Shining (film) Ethics Alexander Technique Avenue Q Paranoia Agent Futurama (TV series - season 5) Scientology beliefs and practices Shit Post-traumatic stress disorder Luck Carl Jung Objectivist philosophy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Poker jargon Polyamory Jon Secada Miss Saigon Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Assassination Super Mario Bros. 2 Love Meaning of life Blood on the Tracks Shaggy dog story Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Sigmund Freud S__ren Kierkegaard Hide and Q (TNG episode) Controversies in autism Anxiety Drama Traumatic incident reduction Characters of The Sandman Pretty Good Privacy Magical thinking Borderline personality disorder Originalism Akatsuki (Naruto) Columbine High School massacre Game show Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Animism Philosophical counseling Blood Simple Contract Emotion Logic RuneScape quests Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Evil Cutey Honey Daredevil Abortion debate Existentialism The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Sleep Out-of-body experience Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Jean Charles de Menezes Numerology Undergrads Consensus decision-making The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) John Howard Yoder Gestalt therapy Narcolepsy HyperText Transfer Protocol Oh My Goddess!

how long does an average dream last dreams feel like they can last a couple hours but how long do they really last dreams typically last in the range of to minutes often the subjective time spent in a dream is much longer one possible explanation for this time stretch effect is that dreams are combined from pieces that have their own different setting in time you first dream of something that occurred a year ago then following of something that occurred just recently mix them up a bit and are left with the remembrance of a dream that lasted a year  Dream Sleep Drill bit Out-of-body experience D__j__ vu Tide Ice age Daylight saving time Massage Graduate school Hebrew calendar Time Rocky Mountains Avenue Q Solar eclipse Lucid dreaming Mount Pinatubo Permian-Triassic extinction event Dream Theater Supply and demand Textile manufacturing Mount St. Helens Boeing 777 Sea level rise Puberty Speed limit Narcolepsy Severe weather terminology (United States) Scientology beliefs and practices Haven (TNG episode) Tai Chi Chuan Hey Jude Astronomy on Mars Global climate model Fertility awareness Bipolar disorder Latitude Year Television commercial La Monte Young Marathon (sport) John Myung Telepathy Friction The Exorcist III Weight training Geology of the Alps Grammatical aspect Baseball Once Upon a Time in America Australian War Memorial Gamma ray burst All Things Considered Day Democracy Extinction event Virtual memory Romantic music Martin Scorsese Oscilloscope Cocaine Reality Jon Secada The Amber Spyglass Cliff Richard Carl Jung Climate of the United Kingdom Dominoes The Cure Natural Selection (computer game) Doris Day Kryptonite Clothing Blonde on Blonde Speed of light Timpani Nuclear explosion Progressive rock Sauna Photography Timeline of the Big Bang Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Global warming Weightlessness Mosquito Antiretroviral drug Hypoglycemia Sperm Whale Hangul Fleetwood Mac Koala Sewage treatment Techno music The Sandman: Fables and Reflections Violin Tangerine Dream Rapid eye movement Diode Daryl Hall

ghostly experience or just me being paranoyed my brother had gone off to college and i was left alone upstairs and i was totally unused to the quiet since my bro always played music at night it took a really long time for me to go to sleep but finally after saying the lord's prayer repeatedly i drifted away a little boy was getting a shot i saw the needle going in his skin and he screamed then the little boy was suddenly in the garden in our back yard playing with a dog he had a band aid on his arm where he had gotten the shot and he was happy i woke to the sound of a child the boy from the dream laughing loudly in my ear his maniacal laughter shattered the silence of the dream and i was awake and shaking i really hate needles and all it was as if he was right beside me there was nothing to make me dream this no i hadnt had a shot that day no i have never had any insane people in my family history and no i have never seen this little boy all i am aware of is that the house that i live in now is really old and a little boy used to live here before something happened to him thats all i know and all that my mom will tell me i think this dream is just that a dream you shouldn't worry about it  Shaggy dog story Sin City Out-of-body experience The Shining (film) One Tree Hill (TV series) Avenue Q Miss Saigon A Day in the Life Sleep House of M Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dream The Star Wars Holiday Special EastEnders What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

what do you make of it i had a dream a while back that i still vividly remember i was jogging through a neighborhood i lived in when i was a kid when i spotted the playground there i sped up to check it out and see if it was as i remembered it i glanced back to see a dark hooded figure standing in the middle of the road so in panic i began to run away i turned left around a corner but the figure was now in front of me it was menacing and i remember being scared for my life i whirled around only to find myself not in my old neighborhood but in a place i had never seen i was surrounded by oak trees with leaves padding every step i suppose it must have been autumn maybe a couple hundred feet from me i saw a house one of those traditional two story new england houses i ran inside and for some reason thought i would find my family there my shoes were loud on the hardwood inside the house as my calls echoed through its empty rooms moving towards the door i felt the urge to look behind i did and found the cloaked figure at my back again in fright i turned and dashed for the glass paned front door but the cloaked man was now again in front of me before i could react a knife found its way into my abdomen and i awoke i'm pretty sure i remember him having one of those grim reaper style scythes at first according to dreamcrowd to dream that you are jogging suggests that you are proceeding through life in a steady pace you are not really taking any action toward changes some people have reoccurring dreams about a small kid while others from time to time dream about unfamiliar children the kid in your dream could represent your inner self or the child within the dream could be based on childhood memories and it may carry a specific message or bring up long buried issues on the other hand the dream could simply be a pleasant memory children in dreams could symbolize a need and an eagerness to learn simplicity intuition new endeavors and many other positive attributes of childhood occasionally the child in your dreams may be pointing to your own childish ways therefore consider all of the details and the tone of the dream before making an interpretation try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Glossary of partner dance terms The Time Machine Tag Contredanse Scenes from a Memory Episodes of Lost (Season 2) House of Leaves Volleyball The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Paul Is Dead Professional wrestling holds Dream Shaggy dog story The Dalek Invasion of Earth Marching band Social rule Fast bowling Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Japanese tea ceremony Columbine High School massacre Blackjack G-Man (Half-Life) The Shining (film) Salad Fingers The Empty Child Running Death (personification) Aerial (dance move) Jon Secada Blood (computer game) Haibane Renmei Parade (military) StarCraft Secret Missions Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories One Tree Hill (TV series) The nature of God in Western theology Characters of The Sandman Miss Saigon The Pilgrim's Progress Fischer Random Chess Shadow the Hedgehog Urinary incontinence Equine conformation Father's Day (Doctor Who) Glossary of American football Time Out of Mind Sin City About a Boy Swingout Out-of-body experience Horse gait Transformers: Armada The Inside Expert system The Doctor Dances The Death Gate Cycle Mickey Mouse Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Pitaten Skateboarding trick Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) False memory K' Dead Like Me Vegeta Wood carving Professional wrestling aerial techniques StarCraft: Uprising Cliff Richard Alexander Technique Avenue Q Softball Customs and etiquette of Japan The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind American football Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Gospel of Mark Macbeth The Subtle Knife Doctor (Doctor Who) Dissociative identity disorder Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism House of M Datalore (TNG episode) Miracleman Figure skating Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Friends Japanese toilet Indianapolis 500 Collision detection

what could it mean if i died in my dream what could it mean if i am running from a group of people trying to kill me and then by the end of my dream the hold me up by my throat and slit my throat thanks and i was also wondering if anyone knew a good website where i could look up dreams or things in my dreams my friends mom has a book like that but i was wondering if i could just use something on the web if you think about it for a moment you'll realize that there isn't any guarantee that specific elements of dreams will mean the same thing to different people the popular literature is abundant with false wisdom about this flying means sex animals have symbolic value etc how can that possibly be one's mind doesn't answer to some sort of rule book in regard to personal meanings what is probably most informative to you is how you emotionally react to the situations that you are presented with in your own dreams it helps to be able to refresh your memory with as best an account of the elements you can recall from your dream as possible if you have interest in this keep a notepad by your bed for jotting down some notes when you wake up in the morning before any aspects of your day cloud your memory remembering dreams is actually a bit difficult it gets easier with effort and time be aware of patterns and recurring themes in your own dreams be ready to write down not only what you remember happening but an honest account of how it made you feel there are no right or wrong answers that come from confronting yourself with your own dreams but there are useful jump off points that can potentially help you to understand parts of your own make up that may not come into the light of conscious awareness otherwise this is useful i hope that helps  Dream Social rule Lucid dreaming Out-of-body experience Scientology beliefs and practices Unconscious mind Philosophical skepticism Socrates Milton H.

what does my dream mean to you i have recently had a dream about a friend that was rather hot and steamy i do not find this man attractive and i have a good looking man of my own in the dream we were sneaking away to a cottage on the beach and made love all the time it is crazy to me because i never thought of this guy as my type does this mean that i have a secret crush on this guy or am i just wanting a little more action in my life i have a good sex life but not the one that i would like sometimes right now i am happy with it help i am a little wierded out by this i am getting alot of good answers keep them coming i have not in real life been with this man would never even think about it he is the complete opposite of my man sex dreams are very rarely about sex and this one sounds the same i mean if you had a dream about sleeping with president bush it doesn't mean he's hot it has to do with power and intimidation of course i think that anyone who falls into that category needs help it seems you answered your own question and that is important since you know what is going on in your life and all the situations that are occuring there is no attraction to your friend he is just the manifestation of something new you said that things in your personal life are not as action filled as you would like and that your sex life is fine but you wish sometimes for more that is what your dream is about talk to your mate and see if there are ways to spice up the relatioinship a little you won't be plagued by having dreams anymore with other men you do not find attractive  Avenue Q Jon Secada Friends Sexual orientation One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule God Emperor of Dune Humphrey Bogart Lucid dreaming Shaggy dog story Cliff Richard Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) EastEnders Something Positive Sex Human sexual behavior Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism 50 First Dates Theory of conduct Socrates Aesthetic Realism The Amber Spyglass Phoebe Buffay's songs Children of Dune Red Hot Chili Peppers Goodness and value theory Sex Pistols W.I.T.C.H.

i need some dream interpretation okay this is it so im in this great white place there are no walls or anything just shinning white and i walk up to this woman with curly light brown hair whos wearing this pale yellow dress with red beads on her neck she wears glasses and smiles very serenly i start talking to her but the words make no sense at all like they were just random words some of them were bear house sinocopated water wall etc this dream seems to be a very spiritual dream but one in which there is a sense of confusion yet the imagery of the great white place and the serene woman indicates a somewhat heavenly place with a sage like person with whom you are attempting to communicate at the same time your communication with her is frustrated because her words to you don't seem to make any sense at all to me this would seem to indicate that you're feeling frustrated spiritually or intellectually as if someone you look up to isn't communicating well to you the imagery of being in a place with no walls would lend itself to two possible things to me depending on how you felt during the dream if you felt scared or confused during the dream then this would probably indicate that dream is one where your subconscious is telling you that your situation is somewhat frightening to you there are no boundaries in your situation and you are a bit frightened because you don't know where you are going and what the rules are on the other hand if you felt no fear or felt light free or serene or just confused by the woman's words then issue of being in the no walls room means that you enjoy being free to create your own path or that you simply accept it as part of your journey either way i think this is definitely a spiritual journey sort of dream your subconscious is indicating where you are in your growth along the path and while you're a little confused right now i think you need to look to how you actually felt in the dream to assess where you are were you scared or were you calm  Out-of-body experience Milton H.

i had a dream i had a tongue piercing does that mean i should get one i used to hate them until now last night i had a dream that i had a tongue piercing and i took it out and placed it next to me and then i decided that i didn't want to lose it because i had just got the piercing and hadn't bought any new ones yet so i tried putting it back in and i couldn't find the hole for a while but i finally found it and was really happy when i had it back in i have my own look and really like pale skin black eyemascara etc plump red lips classy hair and fab classy rock punk hip hop style clothing on me i never would have considered a tongue piercing until my dream last night should i get one i'm please help thanks xao p dream content is symbolic not literal so unless you want a tongue piercing in waking don't get it just because you got it in your dreams i could consider that the piercing would indicate something more along the lines that you are considering learning a new language or using language in a new and different way or that you're trying on different persona or styles in your life to see which ones fit you and your subconscious is telling you the best way to find out if something works is to try it on for awhile to see if it works basically you won't know what works for you until you try it first i doubt your dreams are telling you to get a tongue piercing  Marilyn Monroe Knots Landing Body piercing Shaggy dog story The Amber Spyglass Hip hop music W.I.T.C.H.

dream of the one i had a dream about a year ago it was a very abstract dream so it's hard to explain i was in bed or else surrounded by white fluffy clouds with the one and by that i mean of course my one true love who i obviously haven't met yet since i'm single but i'm not even sure he was really physically there as i couldn't actually touch him and couldn't see what he looked like it was more that it was his presence and that presence was engulfing me and it was sooooooo peaceful and even when i woke up it was like for a couple of minutes he was still there it was such a good feeling this sounds a bit silly but to me it was as if it was the unconcious mind of my true love coming to reasure me that he's out there and we'll be together one day what do you think thanks tah however i don't actually know this guy i could tell you about your sub concious mind seeking the qualities you need to look for in a partnership or hidden meanings etc but what i really think what you want to hear is my story a couple of years ago i was coming out of a long marriage and was as low as possible i wept with sorrow and from the bottom of my heart i cried out to have help to carry on i saw my future partner not clearly but generally height hair colour the way she walks and i felt she was far away but coming towards me i found the strength to carry on months later i met her and fell in love so my answer is maybe your soulmate is coming don't miss them when they arrive good luck  Shaggy dog story Jon Secada Time Out of Mind The Amber Spyglass Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The McGuire Sisters W.I.T.C.H.

i have dreams that come true but not on a daily basis how can i get these dreams to happen more often i get dreams maybe every two weeks that actually happen they're not really important but i start to remember what i dreamed when i see it happening for example recently i was at a baseball game and the game went into extra innings then i saw a kid waving a sign and i remembered briefly what happened but i knew which team would win in what way and it happened again there was a dream that i had that occurred when i was having a conversation with my friends now every time i have these dreams i forget about them until it happens then i recall what will go down how can i have these dreams more often and have them become more detailed you cannot control your dreams you may have psychic dreams if i were you i'd keep a notebook beside your bed or under your pillow and when you wake write the parts of your dream that are still remaining it will get easier with time just words you don't have to make sentences you know point form then you will be able to have an accurate record of how many of your dreams are prophetic and you may be able to spot a pattern make sure you date your log good luck psychic sylvia brown advises you ask god for guidance as to why you are receiving this and if there is a work he needs you to do usually these gifts are not for personal gain  Lucid dreaming Out-of-body experience Dream Derren Brown Philosophical skepticism Jon Secada Social rule The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Playoff Wheel of Fortune Theory of conduct Psychokinesis Boston Red Sox Cliff Richard Edgar Cayce She Loves You Satchel Paige Socrates Telepathy The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan D__j__ vu Emanuel Swedenborg 1919 World Series World Series Time Out of Mind New York Knicks Cleveland Browns No-hitter John Berryman Jean Grey Baseball Stars Ty Cobb A Course In Miracles Thank God It's Doomsday Emotions (album) Phaedo Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Chicago Cubs Troy Glaus War of the Worlds (television) Sandy Koufax Dream Theater Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Unconscious mind Japanese poetry San Francisco Giants Parapsychology Tris Speaker 1957 World Series 1986 World Series Eberron Los Angeles Clippers False prophet New York Giants Miracle Pittsburgh Steelers Maimonides The Catcher in the Rye Humphrey Bogart Apocalypse Christmas San Diego Padres Norway national football team Bowl Championship Series Miami Dolphins Blood on the Tracks Link (Legend of Zelda) Numerology Cricket AFI 100 Years series Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Blog Innings Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)

do dreams really come true do dreams really come true i mean the dreams that you dream at night and somtimes you can remember them threw out the day so ive heard they do from so many people so i dont really know i havent ever really noticed if my dreams come true has it happened anybody else i've had a few dreams come true but they were never anything major like someone dying i hope dreams don't come true because i have a lot of bad dreams i've also heard that everyone you dream about or see in a dream you will one day meet i think that's kind of crap because that cannot be possible but the point is there are a lot of ideas about dreams and their interpretations i'm sure you can dream something to happen before it does people who have a religion typically believe that prophets had a vision of something before it happened so why can't it happen to others but i don't think that every dream comes true that's just ridiculous  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Philosophical skepticism Dream Theory of conduct Craps Prophets of Islam Jon Secada Emanuel Swedenborg The Shining (film) Social rule Time Out of Mind Miracle Year of the Spider Book of Mormon The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Cliff Richard Reality Apocalypse Phoebe Buffay's songs Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Lucid dreaming God Emperor of Dune Jacob Avenue Q End times Mulholland Drive (film) Religion Out-of-body experience Discordianism Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Journey (band) Carlos Castaneda Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix The Power of Nightmares True Crime: Streets of LA Second Vatican Council The Rutles Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) History of the Latter Day Saint movement Anti-Mormonism Saint Prophet Joseph Smith, Jr. Field of Dreams Eschatology Ten Commandments Alan Campbell (pastor) The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Dice Phaedo Scenes from a Memory Fundamentalism Witchcraft Divination Carrie Jacobs-Bond Saga (band) Daniel Minority Report (film) Remember...

is it possible to control my dreams normally dreams just happen but you might be able to direct them somewhat if you are consumed with a problem and you ponder it just before you go to bed sometimes you wake up with some solutions that you had never considered dreams are a very active process of the brain if you consume stimulants such as caffeine or have stress in your life it may cause more brain activity and dreams one gent told me that every time his life was going very well he would start having dreams that he was flying and soaring freely above the earth he loved those dreams  Sleep Insomnia Caffeine Out-of-body experience Urinary incontinence Dream W.I.T.C.H.

what is the meaning of my dream black horse storming i was riding home through town on a big black horse it was pouring rain outside and and storming there was mud splashing up as the horse was running there was a black woman in front of me on a big black horse and she was going faster i couldn't catch up to her i was soaking wet and when i go home everyone was surprised that i had a horse then my dream switched over and i was at the mall and i adopted a kitten a co worker was looking for a garnet ring and i told myself that when i wake up i need to figure out what the meaning of dreaming about a garnet is the horse is wild kittens are tame rain and storm represent difficult times perhaps you need to get in touch with your masculine side and be more aggressive when it comes to making decisions in other words take charge of your life the garnet represents the month of january perhaps the ring alludes to events that happened this past january or something that needs to be done by at during next january january stems from the roman god janus who represents beginnings and ends and doorways my feeling is that you need to make a forceful decision that will surprise everyone the co worker could possibly represent competition could your dream be related to a promotion at work  Horse Softball Eddie Guerrero Horse gait Atlanta metropolitan area Shaggy dog story Battles of Lexington and Concord Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Ben Johnson (athlete) Blood on the Tracks Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Fiddler on the Roof Philosophical skepticism Sin City Janus (mythology) One Tree Hill (TV series) Milton H.

dream help okay so for the last week or so i've been having dreams about my friend dying the first time i accidentaly got in a car crash with him and had to go to his funeral where his parents yelled at me the second i wanted to go on a little boat in the ocean and he got eaten by a sea lion the third burgalars got in the house and killed him cuz he got in the way the fourth i found a little animal and was keeping it in his house but it bit him and it had rabies the last one doesn't really fit with the east but he was my doctor and i didn't want him to be so i made him put me under but he used to much anestetic and almost killed me any ideas as to why these dreams won't stop i've told him about them all and we are stumped there is no one answer for what the dream means generally speaking however dreams about death signify much needed change in our lives such dreams typically herald symbolic rather than literal death in this way death dreams let us know that some part of the self needs to be radically reworked whether it be one's attitudes emotions or relationships though these dreams may be frightening and may linger in our minds for days they do come to us in service challenging us to grow and evolve like all dreams the best approach to those of death is to work with them creatively looking within to ascertain what is no longer needed in our lives and to determine the direction in which we should proceed  W.I.T.C.H.

why do we usually forget our dreams right away when we wake up i think its bizzare there is also a theory in metaphysical circles that when you dream you are often leaving your body in what is called an astral projection meaning that your conciousness leaves your physical vehicle behind for a few hours and collects experiences on another plane of being when you are in your physical body your brain interprets all of your experiences in terms of your physical senses you remember things that you saw heard felt etc if you are operating in anything other than a physical framework your brain really has no frame of reference with which to interprate your experiences therefore while you may not have forgotten it you have no way of conveniently calling it up to your concious memory  Out-of-body experience Astral projection Consciousness Dream Astral plane Lucid dreaming Metaphysics Astral body Mind Quantum mechanics Memory New Age Cognitive science Mind transfer Sleep Philosophy of mind Hypnosis Immanuel Kant Infinity Human Immortality Telepathy Philosophy of mathematics Cordelia Chase Philosophy of perception Religion Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Mental plane Unconscious mind Theory The nature of God in Western theology Deconstruction Cyberspace Psychology Causality Common sense Lorentz group Albert Einstein Property (ownership right) Philosophy of language Brain Emanuel Swedenborg Psychosis Long-term memory Alchemy Rudolf Hermann Lotze Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics David Bohm Science Plane (Dungeons & Dragons) Sense Ekadasi Animism The Invisibles Edgar Cayce Frame fields in general relativity Spiritual evolution Occam's Razor Philosophy of space and time Philosophical skepticism Activity theory D__j__ vu Subtle body Reincarnation A Course In Miracles Mass Origin belief Sign (semiotics) Objectivist philosophy Determinism Thomism Neuro-linguistic programming Pi Luminiferous aether Gee Free will Aristotle Physics Manifold W.I.T.C.H.

anyone know about dream meaning i dreamed that my dad was fishing and i was by the water he was far behind me he cast out into the waater when he felt a fish he went to jerk it back and the hook went through and stuck in my thumb it took forever and a pair of wire cutters to get it out what does this mean im years old and weeks pregnant they don't have control over me and don't take away my personal life identity lol i read that it is friends aquaintances are decieving me want to see if anyone knew any diff this what your dream means fishing represents that you are searching out a way to obtain a goal when your father felt a fish a his line it meant that he was close to obtaining whatever he was seeking for however he was to forceful and did not use skill to secure the matter as a result of his lack of skill it hindered you the thumb represents one's authority to get a hold or grip on a matter this can be having a grip on your emotions finances or physical matters but by your thumb being hooked it represents you being injured in regards to how you handle certain issues  Fast bowling Firefighter Aerial (dance move) Cyberspace Scientology beliefs and practices Professional wrestling holds Deconstruction Jean Grey One Tree Hill (TV series) Chopsticks E.

dreams about my ex bestfriend i met my ex best friend when i was and we were best friends for years not until our first year of college which was last fall of she turned her back on me after she joined a sorority to make the long story short i constantly have dreams about me and her meeting again and confronting each other about why we broke up and eventually we become friends again the same scenario occurs a lot just in a different setting i e at my house bumping into her at a store walking by etc also in my dreams we're always crying of sadness because we miss each other sometimes i wake up feeling emotional because it felt so real as much as i dislike the person she's become does this mean that i still care for her and that i wish she were my best friend again or what's the deal keep in mind that i have these dreams a couple of times a month at first it was just a dream that happens once and only once but it comes back all the time please help hi you are clearly hurt and confused by your friend's behavior she has abandoned you and betrayed your trust as a friend and confidant these long term relationships that are so cruelly ripped away can be as devastating as a loss in your own family it would be highly unusual for you not to be grieving some for your friend who hasn't even asked you to join this sorority these kind of breaks can challenge our beliefs about friendship and its meaning can make us question our own value to others as a friend can make us question what it is that we may have done to cause such a betrayal this makes me very sad friendships are often more important than family relationships your feelings are normal and if you allow your feelings to surface and deal with them time will heal your great loss meanwhile look forward to reaching out in other environs such as a club at school or sport to replace what you lost it appears she was not a good friend but a social climber you must prepare for the eventual return of this person she may discover her mistake and seek you out for rapprochement she may not but she will experience similar symptoms to your own when not too busy with her new sisters meanwhile good luck and god bless  One Tree Hill (TV series) Miss Saigon T'Pol Pitaten Infantilism Social rule EastEnders Clinical depression Transsexuality Knots Landing Eddie Guerrero Jean Grey Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix W.I.T.C.H.

having the same dream again and again i have an weird dream about the my lifes future it goes on and on until it fades away and i start another dream its like i am imagining it all and what does it mean to have the same dream again and again you could be seeking some answers to questions that are deeply worrisome to you you reaching for the same dream indicates that the dreams will probably go on until you reach a satisfactory solution are you worried about which school to attend or your major a boy or what you want to be in life dint worry too much about it it's pretty normal to have unanswered questions at any age but particularly when you are in the middle of pondering what you want to do in life  Shaggy dog story Meaning of life One Tree Hill (TV series) Scenes from a Memory Avenue Q Simon Commission Telepathy Lucid dreaming Phaedo High school Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?

so what do repeating dreams really mean i've been having a repeating dream since i was about well mor elike a repeating nightmare it's basically the 'monster chasing you' type of dream and when about to finally escape you fall and get captured i had it a lot when i was about then i stopped having it as much then started again and now i'm having it only once in a while i'm now i cant go to a therapist about this and i didn't experience anything traumatic at that age not that i remember anyway so what is it according to dreamcrowd dreaming about monsters and demons is very common they may represent negative forces inside of yourself and in your life most of the monsters are representing your own negative characteristics and tendencies the monster in your dreams could be your fear bad temper negativity smoking habit or anything else that is hurtful and needs to be changed the way that you deal with the monster in your dream is generally symbolic of the way you are dealing with the corresponding negativity in your daily life if you wake up from this dream and are very frightened just remember that your mind created those images and that their purpose is to teach you something about yourself to dream that you are running signifies your worries about your health you may be concerned about fitting into society's ideals of beauty alternatively the dream may also indicate that you need to exercise your rights and power in some situation try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  Final Fantasy magic Avenue Q Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Psychoanalysis Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Characters of The Sandman K' Out-of-body experience W.I.T.C.H.

is it possible to dream about someone you haven't seen before yet exists according to dreamcrowd it is very common to dream about all kinds of faces strange faces and familiar faces alike are frequent images in our dreams interpret your dream by considering the face and the general content of the dream a stranger's face could represent different parts of your personality or psyche you think that you are seeing a stranger but in actuality you are seeing a different part of yourself jung said that the stranger is a part of you that comes from the unconscious a comic face may indicate that you have a conscious or unconscious need to mock or snub the conventional featureless faces suggest that you may feel unnoticed and unappreciated on the other hand some believe that the blank or unclear face represents a teacher that is someone who is there to show and teach you a lesson but you are unprepared for it and the face is blank smiling faces are representative of happy thoughts and feelings and possibly anticipation of a joyful event in the near future always remember the compensatory nature of dreams and their ability to point to the opposite of what you experience in daily life try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  Dream Carl Jung Unconscious mind Sigmund Freud Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Analytical psychology James Hillman Collective unconscious Fictional character Psychoanalysis Arthur Schopenhauer Philosophical skepticism Oneiromancy Free will Current teachings of Prem Rawat Alexander Technique Past teachings of Prem Rawat Meaning of life Narcissism Karen Horney Lucid dreaming Gestalt therapy Drama Artificial consciousness Happiness Theory of conduct Modernism Cyberspace The Giver Synchronicity Tarot Jungian psychology Objectivist philosophy Stranger (Myst) Near-death experience A Course In Miracles Edgar Cayce Socrates Shaggy dog story Existentialism Dualism (philosophy of mind) Poker jargon Shadow (psychology) Carlos Castaneda Religion Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Human Human nature Scenes from a Memory Characters of The Sandman Ten Commandments Mythology Psychology of religion Eyes Wide Shut God Emperor of Dune Milton H.

really long dream interpretation my family and i think some of my friends i didn't know any of these people but i seemed really close to them in that way i think watched a tv programme about world war one on the tv then me and two other boys teenagers who i would class as my cousins decided to make a play about the film using war memoriblia we were in the middle of this when i looked at my cousin walking down towards the living room when my boyfriend david was walking behind him i seemed really surpised because in real life he has gone on holiday recently to france i think i gave him a hug i'm about sure but i remember not giving him a kiss he joined in with our play then i dropped a piece of memoriblia that was really important i remember it being beige in colour and it smashing like pottery would i remember one of my cousins shouting at me and i felt embarassed in front of david becasue of this i was worried what my family would think and i thought that they would shout at me then david said he came to pick up his xbox games i think it was xbox and picked them up in a bag from under the kitchen sink there weren't many games in there two it looked like maybe three it was a smallish bag but anyway he didn't stay long and i was upset that he was going to go again this all took place at my dad's old house in eccles which we have moved out of two years ago i think so it wasn't recent but i still miss it sometimes even though i only stayed there once a week next i wouldn't let david leave without a proper kiss and i think he was reluctant at first becasue he had to go but after about three times of me asking him he took me to the corner and gave me a really meaningful kiss but that wasn't the first time we'd kissed that night like that i remebered then on his way out he said he loved me really meaningful we went out of the house into the dark where david's family was waiting in the car david got in and the car's headlight shone on me as if david's mum wanted a look at me becasue she has never seen me before i waved and smiled and pursued to look for my family's car i turned the corner and then i saw the back of my family's car speeding off down the road david's family's car didn't move so i figured that they were still watching me so i remember feeling really stupid turnig round and walking back in this dream i had a vision of david's mum asking me if i wanted a ride home but i was going to refuse because i thought it would be cheeky they didn't ask me in the end though i walked down towards david's family's car and remember feeling embarassed becasue of the clothes i was wearing a beige coat tights and some black shoes probably due to the costumes in the play i remember feeling like a prostitute and all of these worries were of what david's mum would think of me she was the one who was driving so i immiediately thought that she would be the enpowering one in the family plus in real life david does as she says the cars in this dream were small and ford like my family's was red in colour and david's family's car was a really dark colour but i presumed would be green or blue in sunlight david's family didn't seem bad people though according to dreamcrowd to see your own family in your dream represents security warmth and love consider also the significance of a particular family member or the relationship you have with them our dreams are full of symbolism with their messengers being all different types of people it is very common to dream about our friends these are individual that are emotionally valuable to us and we learn about ourselves through them dreams are very rarely prophetic thus whether your dream was good or bad don't expect it to come true this dream is more than likely attempting to bring up uncomfortable feelings that you have about yourself or others remember uncomfortable does not necessarily mean bad dreams are created by our own thinking processes our own thoughts conscious or unconscious create dreams thus the mind that created the dream also knows its meaning try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  Shaggy dog story Social rule About a Boy One Tree Hill (TV series) The Shining (film) Friends The Ashlee Simpson Show The Catcher in the Rye Jon Secada Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Knots Landing Poker jargon Time Out of Mind Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Care Bears Sin City The Amber Spyglass Cliff Richard Father's Day (Doctor Who) Neighbours Miss Saigon St. Elmo's Fire (film) Little Britain 2000 Australian Grand Prix Blonde on Blonde The Star Wars Holiday Special Marilyn Monroe The Inside 1957 World Series Hall & Oates Kodocha The Invisibles Humphrey Bogart Milton H.

what does it mean when this happens lately i've been getting a lot of feelings many more than usual that seem to be accurate about certain things i don't understand this but they are things that some certain people know and i couldn't have known unless i was there which i wasn't i also keep getting these religious dreams that are somewhat confusing but not bad at all what is this something else odd a bit ago i had this dream that i visited a friend of mine in the dream i was wearing this white dress and standing in her doorway i wear a t shirt and shorts to bed not a white dress but she told me that she could swear she had a dream of me standing in her doorway with that white dress i had never told her of the dream what does this kind of stuff mean and yes i've seen a doctor i thought it was mental illness but i was told all is normal what else could it be a lot of people have psychic experiences it's simply something that's not talked about as to what it all means you're the only person who can answer that it means what you think it does  Milton H.

dream help so i am standing in a desert and there is nothing besides me in the desert then out of nowhere the sage pops out of the ground and appears before me he then tells me to look in the air as i look i see floating people in the air shackled together they are pale and ghostly and all are moaning then as i look upon the faces they are everyone i know besides my friends and girlfriend then the sage tells me to eat of which tree i wish i look and tell him that there is no tree and he taps the ground with his staff and again it is divided among my friends and girlfriend i go with my friends because they are more as i did last time as soon as i take the first bite everyone and everything dissapears except me and the desert and then headstones come out of the ground and there are names that i have never heard wrote on them once again i hear the voice tell me that thanx to me all mankind is dead what does this mean this happened days after the this is asking you what do you want from life remember you can have anything that you want from life but anything that you want and work for comes at a price whether good or bad for choices that you make there are results along the path of life that you go you will be faced with many choices some big some not so big remember that for each decision you make there is always a reward of some kind whether good or bad its up to you also you maybe having some regrets for past mistakes that you have made these may have been knowing or unknowing on your part at the time take some time out in the near future to really sit down and learn from them don't obsessed over them you can't change the past only learn from it and try to do better as time goes along also remember this and keep it in mind what is dead can't be resurrected think about this when a person goes to a graveyard there are living visitors but the ones who are staying are not alive if you were to dig them up from their graves no life would be found inside their bodies what is dead should stay dead don't go and try to bring the dead back to life three is a very powerful number it means that a person has grown in life experience the problems that you have faced thus far can only be learned from and that will take time but if you put effort into it you can be able to take bad situations and make good use of them you should write this dream down and keep it with you i believe this can be a great point of inspiration and a guiding light to you in life if you will record it and look at it every so often this can guide you to great things the thing about it is that you have to let it guide you a sword is only good in the hands of a warrior that knows how to use it properly  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Son Goku (Dragon Ball) RuneScape quests Shen Gong Wu One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule Pitaten The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Socrates Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Vegeta Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Children of Dune Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Link (Legend of Zelda) Kain (Legacy of Kain) Piccolo Junior Saga Scenes from a Memory Jon Secada Burial The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters Avenue Q The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Current teachings of Prem Rawat Bad Wolf God Emperor of Dune Romulus and Remus Shaggy dog story YuYu Hakusho Incarnations of Immortality The nature of God in Western theology Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Characters of The Sandman Time Out of Mind Jiddu Krishnamurti Milton H.

dream help there are dreams that are all the same but each have different elements so i will post all three on here and please tell me what you think they each mean i would appreciate it if you would please answer all three i shall write them one after the other as fast as possible thanx here is number i am standing in the air i mean the whole area is just complete sky i look down there is no ground nothing just sky then as i stand there stairs comeout of nowhere in front of me leading up i hear a voice that tells me to approach and climb the stairs i do as they say and reach the top then a cloaked man with a large beard pops up and begins to talk to me as he is talking to paths come up out of nowhere i can not see where either leads on one path is some of my friends from school and on the other is my girlfriend the sage tells me to choose which path to take because one will help mankind and the other will end it so i choose my friends continued below then as soon as i take my first step the whole area becomes black and then i fall and hear the sage tell me that thanx to me all humankind is dead what does that mean remember please answer my others as well more detail is revealed through each dream whenever i look at dream content i would look at the dream content as symbolic rather than simple representation though it is possible that in this case your friends could simply represent your friends and your girlfriend could represent your girlfriend it's also possible that these represent aspects of yourself for example your friends could represent your childhood when you were younger and more carefree and went along with the gang and your girlfriend represents you as a young man as you are growing older and maturing and accepting responsibility for yourself and the world around you you need to think carefully about these people and what they represent to you in your heart and mind to get a better understanding of their place in this dream given the storyline though my tendency is to interpret this as a dream about you feeling divided in your maturation process you feel as if you are somewhat adrift in your life and unsure where you are going the cloaked man in the dream seems to indicate the presence of an elder man or wise man or some spiritual guide that gives you some direction but ultimately you do understand that you have to take responsibility for yourself this is somewhat frightening to you which is where the imagery of the end of mankind comes in you feel as if a bad decision you make will be ruinous to mankind as much as good decisions will be helpful to humanity you come to the point where you must make a decision whether to be responsible or to remain somewhat childlike and have taken the path of least resistance the one where your friends are this is the one which has caused the ruin of mankind i think that this is your subconscious tickling you about something perhaps you have or are considering succumbing to peer pressure when you know that it's not the right thing to do this is a normal part of being young of course but it's something that you feel is not right and you feel that you should have outgrown by now this is your dream self telling you that it's time to start growing up a little more  One Tree Hill (TV series) Human Religion Pitaten Ten Commandments Infantilism Kain (Legacy of Kain) Incarnations of Immortality Shaggy dog story Scientology beliefs and practices Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Sri Aurobindo God Emperor of Dune Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Past teachings of Prem Rawat The nature of God in Western theology Original sin Scenes from a Memory Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Socrates K' Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Religious Society of Friends Transactional analysis About a Boy Hinduism Simone Weil The Time Machine Social rule Parsifal Dream Revelation Carl Jung Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Avenue Q Gautama Buddha Book of Revelation Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Glen Jacobs Urantia God and gender Justification (theology) Storytelling God Victor Cousin Fast bowling Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Meaning of life Jiddu Krishnamurti Deluge (mythology) The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Neo (The Matrix) Education Empathy Origin belief Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Ages of Myst Salvation Sant Thakar Singh Children of Dune Daredevil Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones Paranoia Agent W.I.T.C.H.

dream interpretation a friend of mine knows this guy who says that if anything is to kill him it will be water he recently had a dream that he was talking to the guy when he suddenly said i drowned and disappeared right there out of business he has not talked to the guy in over years and wonders if maybe he did have an incident with water what do you think according to dreamcrowd to see water in your dream symbolizes the meeting between your two states of mind the sand is symbolic of the rational and mental processes while the water signifies the irrational unsteady and emotional aspects of yourself it is a place of transition between the physical material and the spiritual to dream that you are on the beach and looking out toward the ocean indicates unknown and major changes that are occurring in your life consider the state of the ocean whether it is calm pleasant forbidding etc to dream that you are looking toward the water suggests that you are returning to what is familiar to you alternatively you may be adapting or accepting to the changes and circumstances in your life to dream that you are relaxing on a beach signifies that the coming weeks will be calm and tranquil for you your stress will be alleviated and you will find peace of mind to dream that you are working on the beach might signify a business project that will consume most of your time try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  Psychoanalysis Out-of-body experience Sigmund Freud Modernism Scientology beliefs and practices Carl Jung Buddhism Clinical depression Meditation Consciousness Infantilism Miracle A Course In Miracles Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Vulcan (Star Trek) The Amber Spyglass Episodes of Lost (Season 2) The Pilgrim's Progress Scientology Tai Chi Chuan Hinduism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Empathy Soul Autism Numerology Aikido T'Pol Objectivist philosophy Book of Revelation Ecology Urinary incontinence Human Cognitive science God Emperor of Dune Phase (matter) Lucid dreaming The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Supernatural Eastern Orthodox Church Alcoholics Anonymous Artificial consciousness Mantra Baptism Evolutionary creationism Trimurti Religion Hypnosis Logic Traumatic incident reduction Vegetarianism Meaning of life Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Copyright The Fourth Way Music Creationism Stoicism Melanie Thornton Scenes from a Memory Addiction LSD Church of Christ, Scientist Characters of The Sandman Socrates Children of Dune Tide W.

dream meaning ok don't laugh this is a weird bit of the dream i had last night that i remember i had baked a pink cake and it was so good a huge chunk soared into the sky and god ate it i didn't see it happen but i knew he did it was nighttime and for a few minutes the sky lit up like day as if he was pleased lol okay what the heck does that mean i am religious but not fanatic by any means and have never dreamt about god literally before cake to see a cake in your dream indicates that you need to learn to share and allocate your workload instead of trying to do everything yourself cakes also symbolize selfishness or the feeling of not getting your fair share more positively the dream may represent your accomplishments and achievements consider also the metaphor a piece of cake or some situation that is easy to see a partially eaten cake in your dream signifies missed and lost opportunities pink pink represents love joy sweetness happiness affection kindness being in love or healing through love is also implied with this color the color fuchsia represents your connection to your spirituality and meditation you are letting go of old attitudes and ready for change this color is also associated with emotional stability the appearance of hot pink color in your dream represents sex and lust god to see god in your dream signifies your spirituality and expression of your feelings about divinity god also symbolizes an untouchable unreachable and unattainable notion of perfection thus such a dream may highlight your struggles and attempts with trying to be perfect sky to look up at the clear blue sky in your dream denotes peace and freedom of expression if the sky is cloudy and overcast then it foretells of sadness and trouble to have a dream that takes place at night represents some major setbacks and obstacles in achieving your goals there are some issues in your life that you are facing that are not too clear you should put the issues aside so you can clear your head before coming back to it alternatively night may be synonymous with death rebirth and new beginnings to dream of a sunny day symbolizes clarity and or pleasantness you are seeing things clearly to dream of a gloomy or cloudy day signifies sadness if you dream of a particular day then you may need to look closely at that day for any significance consider the number associated with that day a certain date could highlight a special anniversary appointment or occasion to dream of the passing of a day indicates that you need to manage your time better and plot out your goals in a more deliberate manner so i would say that you are trying to hard to change your fate that god has set for you and when you let god take control of your life you will see peace and freedom hope i helped if you dont think my calculations are correct try to put your thoughs together with the info on each subject i gave you  Love Pysanka Scientology beliefs and practices Goodness and value theory Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Happiness The Amber Spyglass A Course In Miracles Past teachings of Prem Rawat Simone Weil Cliff Richard Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sant Thakar Singh Philo New Age Numerology Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Eastern Orthodox Church Idolatry Evil Meaning of life Royal Assent Jon Secada Immortality Religious Society of Friends Hinduism Mortification of the flesh Meditation Brahmanism Scenes from a Memory Time Out of Mind Bhajan Human Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Mercury Atlas 6 Trimurti Horus God Emperor of Dune Christian eschatology Evolutionary creationism Characters of The Sandman Shinto Theodicy Jiddu Krishnamurti Bhagavad Gita Alanis Morissette Baptism W.I.T.C.H.

last night i had a dream and in it i had a pet fox he was very cute a little like a puppy then today while driving home i saw one cross the road i had to step on the brakes so fast anyways do you think this means anything or are dreams just dreams btw there were feeligns of my pet fox being in trouble at times and i was worried for him the fox crossing the road today could have been a coincidence but i think your dream means that there is a project of some sort that you are fond of that you have some doubts about or maybe someone you know who is a little sly that you think needs to watch out our dreams don't always make sense to us but it is our inner mind processing the info that we receive every day sometimes its nonsense but i watch mine because they always have a meaning to me  Philosophical skepticism The Pet Sounds Sessions Dream Housebreaking The nature of God in Western theology W.I.T.C.H.

dream analysis i usually dont think my dreams may mean anything but recently i have been dreaming basically the same thing just in different forms the element of these dreams are basically me in different places and just talking and socializing with random people making friends then getting their email addresses and having pictures taken with them etc the people are completely invented and even the email addresses etc they also feel very real like i have actually made these friends and the photos do exist right until a few seconds after i wake up and then i feel disappointed because i feel like i have formed really solid good friendships in the dreams but they are nonexistant i have these every now and again and thought i'd ask about them as i had one last night i thought it may mean that deep down i really want to make new friends though i dont really feel unhappy with my social life what do you think i'd tend to agree with your interpretation that you want to make new friends or expand your network of friends beyond the comfort zone of your own smaller circle of real life friends although you are not unhappy with your social life you do seem to crave a broader range and diversity of social experiences  Reality Dream Sigmund Freud Psychoanalysis Out-of-body experience Mojave people Unconscious mind Alcoholics Anonymous Friendship Culture Jon Secada Happiness Avenue Q Infantilism Anonymous remailer Lucid dreaming MMORPG Social network Traumatic incident reduction Friends Sexual orientation Transactional analysis Fernando Pessoa Social rule Dog agility Determinism Social psychology Immanuel Kant Music Cindy Sheehan Knots Landing Narcissism Buddhist philosophy James Hillman Singapore gay equality movement Theory of conduct Dream Theater Jack Kerouac Intellectual property Patrick Star God Emperor of Dune Mulholland Drive (film) Computer Evil Arthur Machen Economics Gmail Postmodernism The nature of God in Western theology Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix William Shakespeare Pratitya-samutpada Computer-supported collaboration Internet fraud Inflation Goodness and value theory Atomism Person Deconstruction The Twilight Zone Religion Sociology of religion Franz Boas Philosophical skepticism Please Save My Earth Asperger syndrome Kender The Amber Spyglass Socrates Friedrich Schleiermacher Internet troll Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Cyberspace T-V distinction Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Narcolepsy Anderson Cooper Sleep Facebook (website) Communication skill Left-wing politics Origin of life Homestar Runner Modernism Surveillance Neopets Stopping e-mail abuse Domain Name System LiveJournal Atomic Kitten Anonymity Slavoj __i__ek The Standard Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Microeconomics H.

can someone tell me what my dreams mean i have been having this same dream for a few months now heres how it goes i am riding my cousins horse that i love to ride i'm riding in the pasture behind the house toward a tree that i would climb when i was little i hear someone calling my name and its my family and friends all of them they keep saying things but i cant hear them i turn crossfire the horse around to go back to them but they keep saying hurtful words to me so i always turn him around and start to ride of again but then again they shout things at me and i turn around again and so on its back and forth until i wake up please tell me what this means wayasay misguided rose is actually the name of a cd that i like but it does explain alot about me i am the rose beautiful full of blooming petals but the misguided part just means to me that even though i am sometimes misguided and misunderstood i am beautiful like a rose in my own way i'm going to write in caps and put your words in lower case so i can write faster and include your stuff first of all i noticed your name is misguided rose and you sound misguided by someone you talk about your family what does rose mean to you to me it means love misguided love i am riding my cousins horse that i love to ride horses often represent long journeys they also represent strength so i would guess that you are turning to this horse to give you the power and help you move forward and away from the influences of your family but as we are all ambivalent about this because we crave love attention acceptance from our family and keep hoping to hear what we want to hear from them we keep turning back i'm riding in the pasture behind the house toward a tree that i would climb when i was little climbing a tree and being little you are seeking the feeling you had when you escaped and hide in that tree safe and out of reach i hear someone calling my name and its my family and friends all of them they keep saying things but i cant hear them i turn crossfire the horse wow crossfire perhaps crossfire is in the crossfire between you and your family someone the horse's name is significant around to go back to them but they keep saying hurtful words to me so i always turn him around and start to ride off again the cycle of abuse honeymoon phase is calling your name fear you will leave wanting you to stay and sending out signals to bring you back but then again they shout things at me and i turn around again and so on its back and forth until i wake up phase two of the cycle you come back they feel they got you hooked and they go at you again then comes phase one again please tell me what this means  Jon Secada Battles of Lexington and Concord Shaggy dog story The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix The Dalek Invasion of Earth Vehicular cycling The Time Machine Bringing It All Back Home Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Inside The Shining (film) One Tree Hill (TV series) The Death Gate Cycle Muslim ibn Aqeel Equine conformation Horse gait The Emancipation of Mimi Milton H.

could anyone analyse this dream for me over the last month i have been seeing a great guy but because he finds himself in a difficult situation at the moment i know that he isn't able to offer me a relationship a couple of days ago i left for my holiday and was really happy because this would make it easier for me to move on and forget about this guy its's really weird cause the first night on holiday i dreamt of him coming over to me and apologising for his distance offering me a bouquet of dried flowers the dream was really vivid and light whereas normally my dreams would be dark and grey could anyone help me analysing this dream please dreams are just symbols that the sub conscious creates to help us deal with our problems that we cannot deal with during our awake state dreams can only deal with the past and the present they do not deal with the future why did you have this dream maybe because you wanted to be reassured about this guy and don't really want to break it off with him at least a part of you doesn't but part of you knows that you have to the dried flowers represent the nature of your relationship with this man the vividness of this dream shows how much you want this relationship to continue you need to get on with your life and forget about this guy you need to start living a life without him and prepare yourself to meet someone new that you can hjave a great relationship with  Dream Scenes from a Memory The Ashlee Simpson Show Jon Secada Miss Saigon Philosophical skepticism Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Pok__mon Live!

what in the world does this mean okay this is a dream that i had and am wondering what it means k so i was at this party with a bunch of my friends and family this part was strangy a party that actually happened and as the party progressed i would do stuff with people like my best friend and they would transform to this girl kate that used to be my friend but now is not we talk about her and like no one likes her anymore i woud go over to my mom and she became kate i was about to kiss this boy tommy and he turned into kate what does this mean we kind of ended on bad turms it just kind of ended i chose that i didnt want our friendship anymore to be there so i just stopped it it deffinatly wasnt mutual my choice well first consider where your dreams come from they come from your brain who is the dreamer you you and your brain are the same thing so when it comes to dreaming you are your brain the dream was your brains message to you and you only nobody else can tell you what your dream means except you you the dreamer know how you the one who is awake and asking about her dream will interpret your dream and however you interpret it is correct there is no wrong intepretation as long as it's your own interpretation funnily your dreaming brain knew you would go onto yahoo answers and ask this question so doing that is equally valid  Lucid dreaming The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy One Tree Hill (TV series) Dream Out-of-body experience Friends W.I.T.C.H.

does anyone else have dreams like this or am i paranoid i keep on having these dreams on a fairly consistent regular basis of people showing up in my dreams that i've never met before in my life as usual with me the dreams themselves end up being very vivid highly detailed full sensory affairs but these ones i dream of people i've never met before meeting them in places i've never been before and these people they have questions for me they want to ask me things personal things about my life the tone of the dreams has varied somewhat from a job interview to a full blown interrogation by multiple strangers the messed up part of it is once these dreams start my waking up doesn't stop them sure if i am lucid enough i can wake myself up be awake but if i go back to sleep anytime soon after i end up right back there the interrogation continues i had this happen with me once four times in a night the questions would start i'd wake up go back to sleep it would resume continued that particular night after waking myself up the fourth time in a row i had to stay up for hours straight before i felt safe enough to sleep again and while none of the recurring dreams with this theme have been as intense since still i'm just wondering does anyone else have dreams like this am i the only one being interrogated in his sleep or is this just my brain's way of saying you do yahoo answers way too much i don't know any thoughts or ideas that aren't totally mean and negative would be appreciated thanks hmmm i would go to my mother if i thought she'd be helpful trouble is she had her own issues when she lived yes she's passed on died it's ok you didn't know and i am a bit old here to be going to my mother going to be soon but i do like the response to stress theories so far i have had a lot on my mind and not a lot of social contacts to share things with maybe some of this is my own mind's telling me to dump the info and let it go already and i do have a buddy or two who i talk with about any esper or paranormal side there might be to this they wonder what this is about as well i'd say there is something going on in your life and you really need to be paying attention to everything it could be a sign of what has been or what is to come it may only be an indicator that has nothing to do with you personally but i think your future is going to change and soon  Dream Out-of-body experience Shaggy dog story Milton H.

interpret my dreams i was at a park and it seemed that i had a little daughter she was wearing a lil pink dress and her hand had some kinda deformity appearing like ulnar nerve palsy wrist drop it was kinda random but it was a strange connection between the child and me like id carry her around the park telling her stories watched her play around but there was a concern about her not getting hurt like i guess any parent would but its strange im not in any kinda relationship currently or have been since the past years i'm no pedophile either the second dream i had was i was walking with a person who seemed to be the son of god but not like jesus or anyone perticular i noticed the surrounding but i couldnt see his face there was a point in the walk where we entered an area of water that had steps decending within it i was a lil afraid to enter but he had told me that i could breath so we went inside and i woke up very strange dreams could any one interpret them for me dreams are symbols that the sun conscious makes up to help you through a difficult problem that you cannot handle in the waking state dreams do not foretell the future only the past and the present a smalll child of either sex indicates that you feel safer when you were younger the deformed hand represents the world as a harnful place a place to be wary of so that you don't get hurt in you would feel safer if there was someone there to hold you and keep you safe and watch over you you chose the female sex because they are more likely to be kept safe in an unsafe world the second dream ties into the first dream you were walking with some that had earned your trust that someone was indeed jesus christ you could not see his face because you have not accepted him as your lord and saviour yet when you entered the water he jesus was getting ready to baptize you but by waking before you had the chance indicates that you have not yet decided to make the choice yet the reason that i said that the two dreams were together was that in the first dream you felt more secure safe when you were being held and in the second you were walking with jesus in reality in times of trouble and trials jesus the second part of the trinity holds us up wjen we are in the most trouble and danger in our lives  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Baptism Free will Diving Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Scenes from a Memory Horus Shaggy dog story Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity The Pilgrim's Progress Jesus Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses G-Man (Half-Life) Holy Spirit Eastern Orthodox Church American Idiot The Amber Spyglass John the Baptist Christian views of Jesus Gospel of Thomas Abortion debate The Death Gate Cycle Soul Neo (The Matrix) Lucid dreaming Roman Catholic Church Baptist Dream Jon Secada Rich Mullins Boston Public Justification (theology) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Church of Christ Book of Revelation Infantilism Cliff Richard Bondage (BDSM) Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Escape from New York End times Noah Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) The Matrix Reloaded Community of Christ A Course In Miracles Polyamory Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Messianic Judaism Sin City Rais massacre Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Paranoia Agent Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Dissociative identity disorder W.I.T.C.H.

hi somebody tell me please dream's good or no dreams actually give you insight into your subconscious mind and since this is such a great driving force in our lives it is important to be aware of our thoughts and feelings on such a subtle level even nightmares have value for they focus more on the illusive energy of fear and cause us to be aware of those illusions yes dreams are good it might be valuable to journal your dreams as you could see what issues your higher consciousness is trying to bring to your attention for you to face deal with resolve embrace  Unconscious mind Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Lucid dreaming Psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud Dream Consciousness Gestalt therapy Jiddu Krishnamurti Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants Hypnosis S__ren Kierkegaard Carlos Castaneda Artificial consciousness Advaita Vedanta Philosophy of perception Psychology of religion Domestic violence Self-harm Autism Carl Jung Edgar Cayce Neuro-linguistic programming Existentialism Dark Phoenix Saga A Course In Miracles American Dream Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Siegfried Schtauffen Religion Infinite Ryvius Second language acquisition Awareness Ken Wilber Nightmare (Soul Calibur) Traumatic incident reduction Meditation Marshall McLuhan Insomnia Free will Infantilism Henri Bergson The Mother Chakra Subtle body W.I.T.C.H.

here's a fun dream to interpret my situation i'm years old single rent a duplex start a new job on monday my cat named kiwi is years old i've always been able to tell why i have dreamed about something based on what was going on in my life or the thoughts of the previous couple of days this however has nothing to do with any of it i usually don't remember my dreams unless i'm awakened during the dreaming cycle in a rural area it starts off with me in a house that i've never been to before we went to town to get something from the market and came back i noticed my cat was missing i went into the woods to try to find her i noticed a mideval convoy of about people on horseback on a dirt road i then noticed a lady in a tiger costume on a horse ride past me i then saw tigers perched in the hills above the road watching me next i was running by some deer jumped over and the buck got angry and ran beside me he then turned to attack but i avoided it and ran some more there was some more running in the woods beside a lake and then to some people on top of the hill that forms the lake then there was a bar full of people and we all exited this is where it gets interesting on top of the hill in a group of about people i noticed everyone laid on their backs to look at the sky i did the same and saw a meteor shower although there were way too many meteorites probably about per second and they were too small and moving in a pattern i noticed two red slow moving meteorites leaving a long trail then it all stopped and mars faded into view in the middle of the sky but it was the size of the moon not a red dot then it rotated up degrees and back down degrees then about degrees to the right a small blue light appeared on its surface and everyone started to get scared so we all stood up and ran to the left and heard an explosion in the distance behind us then while running to get away i heard artillery thumps in the distance and looked up i noticed artillery above us coming down at our position and in our path so we all walked backwards while trying to understand this dream in my sleep i remember thinking it must be associated with something mystical and ancient i can't relate this to anything going on in my life right now so any interpretations would be helpful thanks i had to print this out so i could start writing my best selling sci fi fantasy book about this one just kidding it's odd that while your own cat was missing in your dream you still dreamed a lot about cats it could mean that your only constant in life now is your cat kiwi and that without your her your life would be surreal you tend to fantasize or daydream to me which is not bad i do that myself perhaps too much thank god for yahoo answers for such distractions as unusual and changing as life is now for this is what the interesting part seems to me you still look for order and structure something to make sense meteor showers are random and not orderly the way you saw them in your dream you tend to be a follower perhaps since you were in a group of yet you have the ability to be alone and survive just like a cat with nine lives in the same way you avoided a dangerous situation with the buck and avoided it this is what starting your new job represents to me the final part of your dream suggests uncertainty in your new job don't be afraid and go with the flow kiwi is always with you nice dream i'll let you write the best seller  Opportunity rover Astronomy on Mars Paul Is Dead Tai shogi Equine conformation Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March The Time Machine The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Battles of Lexington and Concord Impact crater Taikyoku shogi Code: Lyoko Aerial (dance move) Avenue Q Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Radar Moon The Shining (film) Milton H.

dreams of being in highschool still i keep having recurring dreams that im still in highschool at least every month and when i wake up im sad that im not anymore i just feel out of place when i wake up realizing im and not a teen anymore it's so weird usually in my dreams this happens i either have to rush to school or i get in class but i brag that somehow im done with all my work and classes but im still there but i feel out of place and then i realize wait i did really graduate why am i here then i wake up usually it makes me sad but im so tired of having this dream over and over and over my last year of highschool i went to a charter school the last months so i could graduate on time but i was there and never graduated on a stage i also had a dream once that i was graduating on stage but then realized wait i didn't graduate one stage why am i here i feel out of place as usual and then wake up its really getting annoying yet sad sounds like you have some unresolved issues to do with highschool it's tough to miss out on something that you feel everyone else got to experience like walking the stage at graduation and making that transition from still sorta a kid to full adult can be rocky don't stress about it and don't let it get you down what you're going through sounds pretty normal it might help to keep in mind that while you may feel that you missed out the truth is that there aren't many people who do have the typical highschool and graduation experience my last year of highschool i was in a program where i only went to class twice a week my mom graduated early and received her diploma in the principal's office she wasn't even there on the day the rest of her class graduated and my boyfriend's mom was so obsessed with academic excellence she changed his school almost every year so my point is almost all of us have something we feel we missed out on and almost all of us turn out just fine anyway when you are young and then while you are in highschool it's easy to feel that it's the be all and end all of life experience but the truth is your teenage years are just a handful in your whole life and highschool is only years out of or more it's such a small slice of the pie and while it's a great time of life that should be embraced it's also a tough one think back on the emotional ups and downs you experienced during highschool many people say that while many of their fondest memories are there they would never ever go back to their own highschool experiences you have tons of amazing experiences ahead of you and while letting go of being a teenager can be tough keep in mind that you don't have to let go of all of it what are the things you loved most about highschool your friends your music your hobbies whatever it is you can still make an effort to keep those things a part of your life today even if what you loved most was the school itself you can go to college and repeat the classroom experience for as long as you want the truth is you are still very young your youth is not gone the world is yours if you'll reach out and take it at this point in your life you have nothing but potential ahead of you and it's up to you to make that potential a reality you'll find your place in the world with time anyway i hope some of this speaks to you or encourages you a little if you take some time to examine your feelings about where you are in life right now and think about where you want to go and decide what your attitude will be about your past you will probably be able to resolve this within yourself and the recurring dreams will end best of luck to you sweetie  Scenes from a Memory Kodocha Jon Secada Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) Infantilism Avenue Q Education in Romania Social rule The Lovely Bones Boston Public W.I.T.C.H.

please interpret this dream it's driving me crazy all i remember is a guy slitting my throat and i blacked out and woke up at the hospital they sent me home without fixing my neck and i kept looking for a bandaid because the wound would gape open if i moved my head gross i know but what does it mean by the way i'm serious it was just this morning the guy was very vague and i never felt any pain evils lilly you're right looking at my life right now it's a little crazy we've been living with my parents for over months now waiting for our house to be finished the builder has missed every single deadline we're supposed to close monday and it's not even done could this possibly be it i guess you're answer strikes close to how i'm feeling right now it's hard to live under my parents rules with kids of my own to take care of whew i feel better already the vague guy is the builder and he literally has you by the throat getting it in the neck figuratively killing you he's vague because he is an incidental person in your life right now albeit important when the building is done he will go away the fact that you're in a hospital means that there will eventually be recovery but the lack of a band aid could mean that you resent having to pay him because of all the aggrevation but you must since the work is done as long as it meets agreed upon terms so there is no a aid symbolized by the bandaid this dream will pass into memory when the building is finally done it's main message is that it is an expression of the tension you're feeling  John F.

end of the world i dream of scenes like the movie days later it's the end of the world and there are few humans and many walking dead granted it is a horror movie and things like that give people nightmares but this seriously disturbs me i remember hearing that people only have about a couple nightmares every few months i have these dreams a few times a week in the dreams all i do is hide from them and stay as quiet as possible so what does this mean if you are contemplating some change such as moving ending a relationship even redecorating you may be afraid of the change 'ending a world' so to speak or maybe a friend or family member is changing in a way that makes you feel abandoned anyhow try to think of things that you are happy about especially at bedtime the theme seems to be fear or abandonment count the ways n which you are secure  The Shining (film) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Jon Secada EastEnders Wes Craven's New Nightmare Dream Freddy Krueger Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Horror film The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath A Series of Unfortunate Events Care Bears Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Ten Commandments Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Lucid dreaming Social rule Jiddu Krishnamurti Marilyn Monroe Cliff Richard All Quiet on the Western Front Characters of The Sandman 1957 World Series AFI 100 Years series Fantastic Four Paranoia Agent A Nightmare on Elm Street (series) The Amber Spyglass Buffy Summers Goosebumps The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Hellraiser Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Little Shop of Horrors The Exorcist III Philosophical skepticism Big Brother UK series 6 Nightmares (Buffy episode) Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) The Emancipation of Mimi Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban A Nightmare on Elm Street Rais massacre Scenes from a Memory The Tale of the Body Thief Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Pitaten Obi-Wan Kenobi Gorillaz The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Book of Isaiah Father's Day (Doctor Who) Memento (film) Spider-Man 2 Kodocha Volkert van der Graaf Wheel of Fortune Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

can you interpret my unusual dream about pork skins and missing fingers i dreamed that i was standing in my room and i was eating very spicy pork skins i remember looking at the clock and the time was pm then i remember seeing an elderly couple standing at my bedroom door the old man told me that eating those spicy pork skins make his hands and feet swell up therefore he can't eat them anymore i remembered hearing his thick southern dialect then i remember standing there crunching on the last pork skins in the bag and looking at my hands in order to see if they were swollen just like how the old man had described to me just moments before to my surprise as i was chewing on the last pork skin i discovered that all ten of my fingers were all gone they looked as if they had been amputated just above the knuckles i stared at my ten missing fingers in disbelief and thought that they might grow back the elderly man insisted on taking me out to eat and although i didn't really want to i told him that i'd be ready in just a minute spiritual journey and or job related were you ever involved with the church a church the old man represents wisdom god and your past the time the last hour eating going out to eat fellowship partaking etc chewing meditation meditating on something i e thinking over an issue or etc hands fingers service ability necessity etc can represent a lot more feeling emotions discernment convictions accustaions etc is the number of judgment or double extention of grace i e grace so it was wisdom's warning something youre doing in life is hamful to you i e the old man telling you not to eat them you dont listen and it ends up costing you your ability to serve perform your job this is just my opinion take with a grain of salt  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Pork Cuisine of the Philippines Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Mojave people The Shining (film) Volleyball Joseph (Hebrew Bible) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Eastern Orthodox Church Richard Allen (reverend) Past teachings of Prem Rawat God Emperor of Dune Little Britain Philipp Melanchthon Boom Town (Doctor Who) Barbecue Simone Weil Roman Catholic Church Blood on the Tracks Milton H.

what does it mean when you have a lot of religious dreams i've had dreams dealing with religion for as long as i can remember but recently they've really started amping up i've had a couple of dreams where i've seen muhammad pbuh one where he is standing on a hill in wind and one where something really bad i don't know what has happened to me and my head is in his lap with him saying everything is ok it will be ok i've had dreams where i'm praying dreams where other religious stuff has happened and now last night i had that dream about praying over and over again and at the end of the dream having my third child a boy why do i keep having these dreams a farmer friend i know dreams constantly about places on his farm his equipment his neighbours and generally his dreams are about his farming life because he lives it breathes it and works it my great love is travelling so i have many dreams where i am in exotic and far away places one night i'm in singapore th next venice the next the alps of switzerland we dream about what our attention is focused on because that is where we can best obtain the metaphors for the messages that the dreams have for us having read your profile it seems that you have a lot of your attention directed at the muslim religion perhaps because you re a recent convert it consumes your thoughts and your time take away the setting of the dreams to find the message the setting and characters are what gets our attention your dreams seem to be about comfort what you say in your profile indicates that you find comfort in your new religion most religious followers whatever faith seek comfort and assurance my interpretation of your dreams are that you have a lot of fear and anxiety in your life in order to get the comfort you need you are seeking the support through religion focus on your thoughts and how much negativity is in them watch how this negativity leads to anxiety and fear in the dream of the third child the birth of a child represents the emergence of a new you your subconsious mind is saying that when you find your comfort and the anxiety of fear is gone you will be like a child joyous innocent and happy unfortunately the way to be comforted and to release sadness fear anxiety and worry is not from anything outside of us but from the inside i don't know th teachings of islam but assume like christianity the core issues are things like love your neighbour forgive relinquish hate in your heart don't find fault with others etc comfort can only come from a pure heart when one has turned away from judgement and criticism of others to look to find the things inside oneself that need to be bettered or changed the process begins  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Muhammad Ten Commandments Islam Prayer Religion Religious conversion A Course In Miracles Qiyamah Christianity Jiddu Krishnamurti Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Nation of Islam Theory of conduct Sufism Evolutionary creationism Scenes from a Memory God Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Meaning of life Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Time Out of Mind Milton H.

weird dreams what do they mean all in the same night i dreamt i was some kind of bird human creature but i was a baby and i had to cling to my mother in order to fly around and if i let go i'd fall i was in a creepy old ladies house in the woods she was evil and she tortured people and i kept trying to sneak out of her house without her seeing me i was on a train track and a bus crashed on it than the bus fell down a cliff and smashed i saw it sliding toward the cliff for a long time and i just stood there and watched i was a baby and so was my boyfriend well ex boyfriend now and we were friends we couldnt speak yet but we talked through our minds and we were looking at a book with our life story in it it said all the things we've done in the past and present and i wanted so badly to read the end to see if we'd end up together in the end but before i could read it my boyfriend baby version fell and bumped his head so i carried him to his dad cuz he was crying fascinating you are still not mature enough to fly and must rely on a nurturing authority figure to do the flying for you there is something in your belief system represented by the house that is creepy and that you would like to escape from you are watching something slip away and you can't do or don't really want to do anyhing about it you and your ex boyfriend were not truly ready to have more of a relationship i needed more of a parent than you wanted to be you being the more mature one took him to his proper parent and that ended the relationship that particular book ended when the relationship did however you have a library full of books describing other parts of your lie keep opening them you'll find one that brings you up to date and points to the future let me know if any of this rings true for you  The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Amber Spyglass One Tree Hill (TV series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jon Secada Shaggy dog story The Catcher in the Rye EastEnders Knots Landing W.I.T.C.H.

weird nightmare the dream starts off with my brother and i sitting on a couch on the second floor of this house i've never been in kimbo slice a street fighter from miami was also on the couch we were all talking then all of sudden my brother started making out with kimbo then after that i was sitting on top of the nd floor steps looking at this book i own by bentley little my brother came by asked what are some good stories in the book it was a collection of short stories i couldn't quite make out the words in the table of contents so i said i don't know he said whatever then i looked down the stairs and standing at the bottom was my mom but it was a young her when she was i said hey pj come here he rushed over sand saw then also at the bottom of the stairs was this skeleton looking person with bulging eyes and wearing a dress this was supposed to be my mom but raised from the dead the two were talking to each other then my dead mom looked at me and had a continued a suprised and happy look on her face like she was happy to see me i thought oh no she wants to give me a hug what does this mean a yr old version of my mom and a future dead version of her talking to each other weird according to dreamcrowd to see your brother in your dream may symbolize some aspect of your relationship with him it can also serve to remind you that someone in your waking life has certain characteristics behavior similar to your brother's if you do not have a brother and dream that you have one then he may symbolize characteristics that you need to acknowledge within yourself the brother in your dream can also be synonymous with a close friend or buddy brother also has religious implications and thus represents spiritual issues consider also the familiar phrase big brother is watching you which indicate that your dream has to deal with issues of authority and oppression to dream that you are mad or angry at your brother signifies repressed anger that you are feeling but afraid to express in your waking life to see or read a book in your dream suggests that you are trying to change or rewrite the past to suit your own needs consider what is written in the journal and how it is similar or dissimilar to actual events in your waking life alternatively it symbolizes memories and history to dream that someone is reading your journal indicates that you are keeping secrets you have difficulties telling others how you really feel try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Characters of The Sandman Piccolo Junior Saga Poker jargon Funeral Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an K' Out-of-body experience The Catcher in the Rye Carl Jung Milton H.

you close your eyes surrounded by silence you are relaxed and without worry where does your mind take you my mind goes to a peaceful location deep in the forest there is a small hill at the top of the hill above a lake and towering spruces there is much sun magnificent sunflowers grow there tall and majestic little birds have planted the seeds there one day i will lie beneath these flowers and be with someone special we shall not have any cares or upsets close to nature in our own paradise we will embrace i will pluck a small bloom for my hair talking for literally hours and hours our souls we will bare sipping wine and giggling as i look deeply into his eyes we share a lingering and tender kiss a kiss of all kisses two hearts will then feel as they are beating as one this is exactly where my mind takes me in such moments  Sunflower Jon Secada The Amber Spyglass Japanese tea ceremony Milton H.

why did i dream about him i work in hospital there is a handsome surgeon who is married his wife is a doctor here to he and i have never had a conversation and have no contact at all other than in passing i could be wrong but i really think that he goes out of his way to make eye contact with me and holds it longer than normal and when passing in the hall i've looked back and seen that he was staring at me i've seen him rush like crazy to open a door for me that he wasn't even intending to go through this has been going on for a few months i didn't think anything of it because men often react that way i'm pretty nice and smart i'm married and even though not happy have never cheated in my marriage never even been tempted i'm shocked now because i had a dream last night about the surgeon i don't remember all the details but it was definitely him it was intimate and sensual what's up with that do i have a crush if i do it would be the st one in years according to dreamcrowd to see a lover in your dream symbolizes acceptance self worth and acknowledgement of your true inner value it may also indicate integration of masculine and feminine traits into yourself you are feeling complete or whole to dream of an old or former lover signifies unfinished unresolved issues related to that specific relationship your current relationship may be awakening some of those same issues try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  Marilyn Monroe W.I.T.C.H.

i'm married and pregnant and dreaming of a fantasy man last night i had a dream where i was not pregnant and wasn't even aware i had a husband i was with friends from high school hanging out when an absolutely gorgeous guy approached me and we all of a sudden started to kiss the chemistry was undeniable he took my hand and we started walking to this courtyard when this happened it all of a sudden fell nightime and the stars shone brightly like never before another thing that was strange was that there was fish swimming in the air as blue and vibrant as his eyes he took me in his arms and we seemed to float in midair with the same magic electricity as when we first locked eyes the dream ends there is this normal why was my husband completely out of the picture do i secretly want to have an affair or did i just get lucky with one last fling before i start a family with my husband i would love to hear your input ah don't worry it doesn't mean you're having an affair this first thing might sound a little new agey and cheesy i read in a book once that when you dream of a lover of the opposite sex who isn't your real life lover it's like a shadow or projection of a part of your soul or of an opposite energy connected to your soul he showed up in your dream to show you that he will love and protect you and that you will be happy in your new family night time and water symbolized by the fish imply femininity and your subconscious to further that theory maybe he symbolized something new coming to you your baby or the fact that you will be raising a family something that you will be in love with and treasure wholeheartedly i can't think of anything else but it sounds like a happy and wonderful dream and since you seem to have no intention of leaving your husband in real life i would take it as a good sign d  EastEnders The Amber Spyglass Jon Secada Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Knots Landing Shaggy dog story Scenes from a Memory W.I.T.C.H.

what does my dream mean i've had this dream soooooo many times i'm trying to get somewhere but i keep falling down everytime that i get up my legs give out and i just fall down again fall to dream that you fall and are not frightened signifies that you will overcome your adversities with ease to dream that you fall and are frightened indicates a lack of control insecurity and or lack of support in your waking life you may be experiencing some major struggle and or overwhelming problem it may denote that you have failed to achieve a goal that you have set forth for yourself to dream that you are free falling through water indicates that you are feeling overwhelmed with emotions you may feel that it is easier to give up then to try to stay afloat or prevent yourself from going under i'm falling falling dreams are another theme that is quite common in the world of dreams contrary to a popular myth you will not actually die if you do not wake up before your hit the ground during a fall as with most common dream themes falling is an indication of insecurities instabilities and anxieties you are feeling overwhelmed and out of control in some situation in your waking life this may reflect the way you feel in your relationship or in your work environment you have lost your foothold and can not hang on or keep up with the hustle and bustle of daily life when you fall there is nothing that you can hold on to you more or less are forced toward this downward motion without any control this lost of control may parallel a waking situation in your life falling dreams also often reflect a sense of failure or inferiority in some circumstance or situation it may be the fear of failing in your job school loss of status or failure in love you feel shameful and lack a sense of pride you are unable to keep up with the status quo or that you don't measure up according to freudian theory dreams of falling indicate that you are contemplating giving into a sexual urge or impulse you maybe lacking indiscretion falling dreams typically occur during the first stage of sleep dreams in this stage are often accompanied by muscle spasms of the arms legs and the whole body these sudden contractions also known as myclonic jerks sometimes when we have these falling dreams we feel our whole body jerk or twitch and we awaken from this jerk it is thought that this jerking action is part of an arousal mechanism that allows the sleeper to awaken and become quickly alert and responsive to possible threats in the environment according to biblical interpretations dreams about falling have a negative overtone and suggest that man is acting and walking according to his own way of thinking and not those of the lord recurring dreams most dreams contain messages that serve to teach us something about ourselves unfortunately many a times we forget what we dream about as we go about our daily routine with recurring dreams the message may be so important and or powerful that it just will not go away the frequent repetition of such dreams forces you to pay attention and confront the dream the dream is trying desperately to tell you something such dreams are often nightmarish or frightening in their content which also helps you to take notice and pay attention to them recurring dreams are quite common and are often triggered by a certain life situation or a problem that keeps coming back again and again these dreams may recur daily once a week or once a month but whatever the frequency there is little variation in the dream content itself it usually points to a personal weakness fear or your inability to cope with something in your life past or present the repetitive patterns in your dream can reveal some of the most valuable information on yourself it may point to a conflict situation or matter in your waking life that remains unresolved or unsettled or some urgent underlying message in your unconscious is demanding to be understood following are some tips in overcoming your recurring dreams in understanding your recurring dream you must be willing to accept some sort of change or undergo a transformation you must be willing to look within yourself and confront whatever you may find no matter how difficult it my be you must be able to look at the dream from an objective point of view try to get pass the emotional and reactive elements of the dream and get down to the symbolic images many times dreams are masked by elements that are disturbing preventing you to delve any deeper this is a defense mechanism that your unconscious may be putting up be patient do not get discourage if these dreams still recur even after you thought you have come to understand them learn to accept yourself truly and fully often times once you discover what your recurring dream is trying to tell you these dreams will change or altogether disappear  Out-of-body experience Scientology beliefs and practices Dog Psychoanalysis

if someone has dreamt about their own mother old enough not to have kids anymore about to have babies some of them have already been born whilst some others haven't what does this indicate the dreamer felt happy for the mother but the mother felt tired with the thought of having to take care of so many babies i know it's pretty specific the thing is the dreamer's father is having major problems with his health that he is currently admitted to a doctor a life and death situation i wouldn't like to think that the dream indicated that the mother would actually re marry it wouldn't make sense a good dream forum site will be appreciated too most dreamers do not dream prophetically babies represent new beginnings and or creativity is usually a number about travelling and writing but all this applies to the dreamer not the mother in the dream since the dreamer is happy about the mother's situation my guess is that the dreamer is looking forward to those new beginnings the mother is drained the dreamer is tired of his her responsiblities and is drained represented by the mother in the dream  Philosophical skepticism Theory of conduct Lucid dreaming Carlos Castaneda Humphrey Bogart Marilyn Monroe Haven (TNG episode) About a Boy Happiness Infantilism Knots Landing AFI 100 Years series Goodness and value theory Kodocha Childbirth Care Bears Jon Secada Abortion debate EastEnders Radical Dreamers Kate Bush The Amber Spyglass Charles Dickens John Howard Yoder Scenes from a Memory Ethics Carl Jung The McGuire Sisters Alois Hitler Charmed Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) Cliff Richard John Berryman Phoebe Buffay's songs Edgar Cayce Breastfeeding Pitaten Israel ben Eliezer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Leslie Cheung Kimi Finster Charles Goodyear Miss Saigon Frankie Vaughan W.I.T.C.H.

intrepret my dream anyone hi i had a dream last night and i'm bothered by what i did and saw in the dream i remember that i carrying another female somewhere and i'm assuming it was a house and i sort of felt like a man or maybe even turned into one but then i realized that i wasn't and immediately put thelady down and went to go find her prince charmings so they could go figure out who she belongs to and argue over her just to let you know i'm completely straight i'm not a transsexual or a cross dresser i don't find females attractive though sometimes i compare myself theen i found myself in disney land waiting to ride the new nemo submarine ride with a close friend i haven't seen in a while as we got on the ride there were a couple of attractive guys and we immediately started talking i saw them in my dreams a couple of times while on the ride some of them kept complaining that it was a waste of time but i disagreed and told them to look at the lovely features and animals later we just lef often times in our dreams our sub conscious minds rationalize one illogical event with another possibly illogical event in your case your dream may have found you carrying another woman and then to rationalize that you felt like a man maybe were a man or a prince charming for a short bit till your mind said that doesn't make sense i'm a woman so you set her down to look for her real prince charming and prince charming of course reminded you of disney and so there you were thinking about the new disney ride and talking with attractive men maybe your prince charming you may have dreamt the men were bored on the ride because men and boys classically like the adrenaline rush of the speedy roller coasters and so you found yourself teaching them how to appreciate the astestic features of the ride you may have seen them many times because our dream cycles often repeat the dream within a night each time having the same dream with perhaps slight differences my question is do you remember how it all started why you were carrying the woman to begin with perhaps she was injured or couldn't move perhaps she is a version of how you see yourself longing to be carried away by your prince charming  Shaggy dog story Milton H.

can someone interpret my dreams please it starts out a couple of people in boat and there' s me and a guy holding on to the end of the boat we're in the water not on the boat and i help this blond girl get into the boat i guess she fell out or something and we're headed towards like a cave somehow we managed to go the guy father's house i guess he's my boyfriend since we were holding hands and were awfully close he and his father take me to the backyard and the father says you should tell her and so we walk to this area and the father starts digging and he dug up clothes of a baby boy and like crib liner thing he starts explaining what happened though i couldn't hear so the father told me to rest my head on his leg and he told me that he saw them kill his father in front of him and then we walk back into the house and like the government people were there and one of them took my boyfriend and his father and left and one of them told me to go outside with a blanket but couldn't leave remember that dreams are symbols that are created by the sub conscious so that when you dream you can deal with problems that you cannot handle when you are awake from your dream i believe that you have a need to hang on to people and things for security you have a problem with adults and authority figures when something occurs that you don't want to handle you shut it out so that you don't have to hear it and deal with it when in fact you need to be open minded so that you can hear and deal with the problems in your life so that you can get through your problems and get past them and get them out of your life once and for all if you underdstand what i am saying and agree with me then i would like to suggest that you go see a therapist for a while and get your life back on track where it belongs  Scenes from a Memory Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Amber Spyglass Milton H.

anyone else have a recurring cast of characters in their dreams because i do they are always different stories involving the same group of people and this has been ongoing for nearly years now it started out with only people but has now grown into a group of around i have actually 'been' one of the characters and this seems to happen when this particular person is in my dream what is odd is that recently i discovered in a funny way that he is gay and has been in a relationship with one of the other characters in my dream i'm almost positive my jaw dropped in my sleep because i had no idea that he or the other character for that matter were gay at all if any of you were wondering most all of the events in my dreams seem to be inspired by the online game 'city of heroes' and the role playing game 'vampire the masquerade' if you dream that you are gay but you are not in your waking life or hanging out with a group of gay people it is symbolic of self love and self acceptance you are becoming comfortable with your sexuality and masculine side if in your dream you hate the idea of homosexuality then it represents your fears and rejection of parts of your own sexuality if you are gay in real life then the dream is simply a reflection of your own self your subconscious mind might be telling you that your girlfriend or friend is keeping a secret from you in some way or you could just be feeling insecure about the strength and nature of a relationship communication is key to finding out what's really going on  Avenue Q Gay Sexual orientation Friends Bisexuality Human sexual behavior Gender role Recurring South Park characters Ex-gay Dream Homosexuality Slash fiction W.I.T.C.H.

can dreams really come true i've had several dreams where there's a fire somewhere and i'm frightened to death that it would burn down my house usually my family and i would rush to pack our things to get out quickly well a few days ago there was actually a fire that sparked up a mile away from where i live and i was really freaked by it another dream i had was that someone had bought something for and when i woke up my mother had come back from the store and said that something i don't remember what it was cost it was weird also i had a dream about terrorists dropping bombs from helicopters and airplanes they all had little parachutes onto my hometown and blowing things up then that pipe bursting in new york thing happened is it all just a coincidence when i was a little little kid back in the early s i had a dream about the super mario brother's video game years before it hit the market the dream was actually about the donkeykong video game only there were many levels with secret passage ways etc etc years later when they came out with supermario which was based on donkeykong on much more complex in case you weren't around in the golden age of video games no one believed me about the dream the downfalls of psychic power is that you usually don't receive information that will help you in your life and that everyone is skeptical and not likely to believe you i don't even believe people when they talk about supernatural things and i've had a lot of supernatural things happen to me  Mario The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Supernatural Out-of-body experience Link (Legend of Zelda) Super Mario Bros. 3 The Invisibles Philosophical skepticism Computer and video games Knots Landing Transformers: Cybertron Blood (computer game) Conker's Bad Fur Day Koopa Troopa Syphon Filter Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Super Mario Bros. television series Dream Sega Saturn W.I.T.C.H.

psychic guidance concerned about psychic dreams and premonitions i have been having premonitions day dreams and visions that have often been prophetic in nature also i have had a few night dreams that i remember that seem to come true its not like a deja vu thing but actual images words and events that have yet to happen so far nothing has been of a hurtful or bad nature its usualy mundane or insignificant but i am worried about the chances of that sort of thing happening when i have day time sensations its usualy something that is going to happen within hours when i dream it usualy is much longer away weeks months i get very uneasy when it happens scared is more the word for it i am looking for advice on ways to deal with this my friends say it is a gift to me it feels more like a curse ok first of all dont be afraid of it it is a gift and look at it this way when you have a dream or vision of prophesy it is possible to use that information to lessen the impact of the event or even alter it like to warn you or someone else not to go somewhere at a certain time becasue a bad event will happen you may save a life and others may still be harmed but you have to remember when its a persons time to go it is their time and other people can be saved from a trajedy because they werent meant to be there and that near miss will effect them in such a way that it can change their life for the better do you get what im saying i have had many many prophetic dreams and some of them were about people dying and it upset me a great deal but then i realized that it was their time to go and me being warned about the event before hand made me avoid the event and prevented me from being involved and harmed because it wasnt my time i was only meant to bear witness to the event not experience it directly  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dream Jon Secada God Emperor of Dune Theory of conduct Social rule Miracle Phoebe Halliwell The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Father's Day (Doctor Who) D__j__ vu One Tree Hill (TV series) Prophet Parapsychology Scientology beliefs and practices Lucid dreaming Out-of-body experience Charmed Cliff Richard Predestination paradox Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Numerology Avenue Q Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Religious Society of Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jewish Messiah Children of Dune Ezekiel Macbeth Ten Commandments House of M Kain (Legacy of Kain) Miss Saigon Scenes from a Memory W.I.T.C.H.

what does it mean when someone in your dream dies my boyfriend died in the dream i had last night i love him with all my heart and would never wish death upon him he is also very healthy and never gets sick so what does this mean all help is appreciated ack i'm starting to get really scared now i really hope he doesn't die i'm fairly certain it doesn't mean his death is imminent or anything depending on the context of the dream it could mean many different things you didn't mention anything about watching him die or being the one that kills him or anything like that and you say you have a very close relationship so my best guess is that you're just scared of losing him forever not necessarily from death maybe from him moving away or something when interpreting dreams remember that almost everything is symbolic his death doesn't mean he will die it just symbolizes something relevant that might be worrying you  EastEnders Characters of The Sandman Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Immortality Philosophical skepticism Phaedo Dead Like Me Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sin City Jon Secada One Tree Hill (TV series) Avenue Q Pitaten Philosophy of language Kylie Minogue The Lovely Bones Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Phoebe Halliwell The Amber Spyglass Time Out of Mind Sharon Tate Social rule Scenes from a Memory StarCraft: Uprising Shaggy dog story Karen Horney Ten Commandments Reincarnation Kimi Finster Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) W.I.T.C.H.

wierd dream with me going crazy and demons buried in a moon okay so this is how it goes at first im playing a game kind of like a mix of paintball and lasertag but it hasnt been invented yet and wer playing in a really huge building with like floors and there is this guy thats behind a desk and hes running the game and he keeps giving us little missions to get us ready to start playing and so i was doing them and then i saw this gatorade waterbottle i had and another empty waterbottle in my vest pocket and since the gatorade bottle wouldnt fit i emptied the gatorade into the waterbottle and then the guy that was running the game said that i was the best one and smiled and then i skipped over to being in this house alone and i was looking out this window and i saw this moon that was right outside the window and was so close i could touch it so i stuck a paperclip in and said that when i come back the moon would have rotated so the paperclip would be on the top and in the back of my mind i was thinking that it wasnt going to be there at all when i came back so i went to walk around the house and it turned into a party and i just stayed their talking to people for a while and then i came back to the window and there was no paperclip so i stuck another one in and started to dig a little hole and i saw a demon in it and it tried to pull me into it so i just burried it and left and i started going downstairs to the party and at the top of the stairs i got stuck and couldnt move any part of my body and i started thinking that maybe when people go crazy their spirits get stuck somewhere and their body runs around all crazy and no one knows that its not really you and that your spirits really stuck somewhere and then i got unstuck and went down the stairs and then i think my alarm woke me up you dream has two segments or major items to be considered to interpret this guy behind a desk that runs the game moon with a paper clip gatorade bottle vs empty water bottle need being praised by the guy about you are the best one seeking recognition stuck a paper clip in the moon leaving some mark make impression seeing a demon like regret guilt conscience let's conclude the dream you may have some need in your reality that you are seeking a heavy recognition projecting yourself being praised by the game who runs the game show symbols of looking for respect and attention this guy in some sense could symbolize anyone who is above you in reality it could be your boss teachers parents or any one who could grant your permission for things you want to do you may be getting acceptance in reality projecting yourself being the best by his approval shows some sign of accomplishment in life at the same time you clip the paper on the moon shows symbol of making an impression to others however may be due to guilt conscience or over confidence you may be feeling a little regret projecting demon in this case could mean that you are having some conflict in some way it could mean something you may be overdoing it and you regret about it basically you are venting out your accomplishment feeling in dream you may be trying to suppress it but can't do it in reality but do it in dream  Columbine High School massacre Humphrey Bogart The Inside Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Aerial (dance move) Out-of-body experience Milton H.

weirdd dream what does it mean okay so thier dream was sooooper weird b c it was like crazy twisted dreams in one first i was on this huuuuge ship my family and my bestfirneds micaela and ashley were there too there were water log rides on the ship a lot of them and some of them didnt have any water me and my firned were going on a lot of them but then i when on a ride by myself this one had no water and it was going very slowly while i was riding it we passed a bar that was having kareoke night this bar was on the ship so i jumped off and sang kareoke for the people at the bar when i returned to my family i told them how i sang kareoke and then just laughed when we got off the ship my family was gone and the only people with me was my firned micaela and her younger brother and sister we were all dressed in rags and everything was white and micaela my friend who normally has really long hair had her hair cut boy short she was carrying her brother who seemed really sick this is continuing what i wrote above we passed a lake the water was white in the lake micaela accidentally dropped her brother in the lake and she started sreaming oh my god my brother is dead my brother just died help me a man standing by the lake pulled her brother out of the lake with a cane she cried for a while but we had to leave him after this micaelas sister was gone nothing happened and no one said anything to me but i knew she was dead then we headed on to a forest of all white trees nest i was in a play ground and i had met up with my friend ashley she was playing with chalk she asked me how me and micaelas trip was i told her how her brother and sister died she drew a sad face with a tear with chalk on the sidewalk then started crying saying how bad she felt nest we all were in a old haunted house we were all witches now the house was dark and we were told to find our classroom we were really lost and scared but i led them through the house this is continuing what i wrote above first we ended up in a classroom where we found a bunch of kids behind a chain link fence screaming it looked like they were being eletricuted we went in and started screaming too but it turned out it didnt hurt it felt kinda like a rollercoaster when we found the teacher she yelled at ur and told us we cant be in there and that we had to find our class room we wandered somemore in the creepy house and came upon a huge theater it was half filled with people dressed as monsters then they taught us how to defeat monsters they said we had to throw a weird brown rock at them to kill them and that was it i know its weird sorry its so long according to dreamcrowd to dream that you are on a cruise represents some emotional journey that you are going through the dream may also be a pun on cruising through situations in your life with ease and little effort to see your own family in your dream represents security warmth and love consider also the significance of a particular family member or the relationship you have with them to see your friends in your dream signifies aspects of your personality that you have rejected but are ready to integrate these rejected part of yourself the relationships you have with those around you are important in learning about yourself additionally this symbol foretells of happy tidings from them and the arrival of good news to see your childhood friend in your dream signifies regression into your past where you had no responsibilities and things were much simpler and carefree you may be wanting to escape the the pressures and stresses of adulthood consider the relationship you had with this friend and the lessons that were learned alternatively the childhood friend may be suggesting that you have been acting in a childish manner and you need to start acting like an adult to dream that your best friend is dying suggests that some aspect or quality that your best friend possess is dying within your own self try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  Shaggy dog story Scenes from a Memory One Piece minor characters RuneScape quests Pitaten Piccolo Junior Saga Characters of The Sandman W.I.T.C.H.

what does this mean i had a dream where a gingerbread man came out of our spare room with a knife in his hand and his eyes were glowing green no joke this is totally true plz help what does the ginger bread man mean to you do you have a child hood or adult connection with the character the nursery rhyme fairy tales the movie shrek or making gingerbread cookies around the holidays this seems to me to be something coming out of a room in your brain that is seldom addressed by you a memory of the past or something you just havent paid attention to in a while your mind may have turned this into a gingerbread man in an attempt to get your attention bizarre things get our attention more than the mundane glowing green eyes says to me that somthing is possibly being given the green light to go sometimes things that we dream and perceive as frightening are really not intended to be so we just take it that way and comming after you with a knife attacking you i would say that its something that you are maybe frightened of facing but its really not as bad as you think logically who would really be frightened of a cookie the knive symbolizes cutting something cutting away an old and unecessary fear or possibly feeling attacked by silly little things i hope this helps but the first step for you is to figure out what the gingerbread man means to you good luck  Care Bears Shrek 2 Shaggy dog story Cookie The Shining (film) Knife Dean Koontz Gingerbread Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Artificial consciousness Dream Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Meme Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Carlos Castaneda Philosophical skepticism Scenes from a Memory The Unquiet Dead Logic Invader Zim Little Britain W.I.T.C.H.

my dreams are always in dark colors does this mean anything the problem with set archetypes as jung tried to prove in his life time is that it does not pertain to every own what does an arch angel mean to a shinto of a muslim it is strictly based on the mass public which at the time of his writing mainly christian based so to a lot of people dark colors represent something dark and ominous or something foreboding but perhaps to you dark colors are practical slimming and pleasing to your life style th e dark colors i would assume pertain to how you feel about them there is no book of definitions that can tell you exactly what they mean as for every one it is different what do dark colors mean to you what role does it play in your life do you find them useful to film scenes if you are a director or film maker do you wear them as you feel more slimming in them do y ou like me where alot of black as it easy to dress without bending the brain as to what to wear or is it forboding and scary  Carl Jung The Matrix Color Psychology of religion Religion Gender role Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Dream The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) The Endless Chocolate Tightlacing Austin Powers Christopher Walken Samus Aran Marching band Narcissism NP-complete Islam Marilyn Monroe Themes in Blade Runner Predestination Jessica Alba Goth French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Yu-Gi-Oh!

why do i keep having dreams about dinosaurs i have a book which explains dream meanings but dinosaurs is not in it its not a recurring dream its different dreams with dinosaurs in them always carniverous spelling dino's t rexes raptor type things etc i never get bitten or eaten but am always being chased by them or hiding from them and its usually in houses or in a residential street seriously its bugging me now i've had these dreams about times over the last year or so c'mon someone tell me what the hell is going on in my brain kim you're not going to find the answer in those dream interpretation books they're fun to read i had one when i was younger too but a book that says for example water means this trees mean that is taking objects out of the context of the dream it doesn't know your entire dream who you are what's going on in your life etc therapists are trained to interpret the dreams of their patients but even they make sure the patient does most of the interpretation just guides them once in a while they will tell the patient what they see in the dream by the way i am certainly not saying you need therapy most people have recurring dreams or as in your case dreams that have recurring themes some are very common to many people such as dreaming you are falling or flying i myself have been having types of dreams with recurring themes for the past couple years and i have yet to figure them out kim i don't know how old you are but i would hazard a guess that you are young excuse me if i'm wrong the subject of dinosaurs is very popular in addition to learning about them in school we see movies about them etc so it's not surprising that they would be the main subject in your dreams now the fact that they are carnivorous is important that means they are a danger to you also you said they are always chasing you or you are hiding from them you know that the dinosaurs are symbolic of something else in your life that is frightening you even if you are not aware of it it's in your sub conscious or even deeper in your un conscious the good thing about those dreams is that you never actually get hurt or destroyed this shows that you are a strong resourceful girl and the dream is showing you that whatever is scary to you in real life can't really hurt you that you can handle it no matter how big a problem it seems no matter how overwhelming the fact that they take place in houses or in residential streets tells me i would need to know more information about that part of the dreams about you i could easily say it suggests something is going on in your family some change that took place a year or so ago or an on going situation that started then but that could be wrong it could simply mean that houses mean something to you so i won't try to jump to any conclusions there one good thing is that you have had these dreams only about times over the past year or so that's not even one a month so that tells me that you are really not that terrified as the dreams would imply we also tend to work out real problems we have by symbolically making up a situation in our dreams at night and as we work out the situation in our dreams we are working out our real problems sometimes without even realizing it i hope this helped you somewhat what i can say is that the dreams tell me you are stronger than whatever issue is going on in your life whether small or big good luck  Dream Avenue Q Scenes from a Memory Meaning of life Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Amber Spyglass American Pie (song) Autism Alcoholics Anonymous Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Carl Jung Calvin and Hobbes Sigmund Freud Pitaten Paranoia Agent Philosophy of language Sin City Milton H.

ive had dreams that i was raping a girl and it really scared me does anybody know anything about this this really scared me because i know i'm not a rapist i think i may just be really horny one reason this really scares me is because even though i know i would never do it i can't say i know that i would never do it if i was intoxicated maybe i just watch too much tv but ive seen many shows when people raped someone when they were really drunk or something i would say yes you are just really horny for that you should take matters in your own hands rape is more about control then sex maybe on some levels you feel out of control in your life especially in the dating arena i would also suggest a visit to a good therapist just to sort out your feelings before they get outta control good luck  Rape Statutory rape Avenue Q Sin City Theory of conduct Abortion debate Satanic ritual abuse EastEnders The Lovely Bones Great Teacher Onizuka Human sexual behavior The Catcher in the Rye Dead Like Me Sexual addiction Nip/Tuck About a Boy Jon Secada Maison Ikkoku Birth control Red Scare Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Abduction Phenomenon Charles Ives Cybersex Comfort women Rape fantasy Traumatic incident reduction Luck Silent Night, Deadly Night Transsexuality Aquemini Very special episode Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Anarchism and society Penis removal Birthday Milton H.

do these dreams mean anything i have these dreams quite a lot the first one i'm walking along a beach in a blue bikini and somehow a smokin' hot body i'm looking for a blue shell then i suddenly go blind the second one i'm in a big house with of my close friends but we are all about one of them comes home bleeding barely able to drag herself inside she dies in my arms with the other two laughing my dreams are very strange do they mean anything i wouldn't ask if i didn't have them so often according to dreamcrowd to see the beach in your dream symbolizes the meeting between your two states of mind the sand is symbolic of the rational and mental processes while the water signifies the irrational unsteady and emotional aspects of yourself it is a place of transition between the physical material and the spiritual to dream that you are on the beach and looking out toward the ocean indicates unknown and major changes that are occurring in your life consider the state of the ocean whether it is calm pleasant forbidding etc to dream that you are looking toward the beach suggests that you are returning to what is familiar to you alternatively you may be adapting or accepting to the changes and circumstances in your life to dream that you are relaxing on a beach signifies that the coming weeks will be calm and tranquil for you your stress will be alleviated and you will find peace of mind to dream that you are working on the beach signifies a business project that will consume most of your time to dream that you are blind represents your refusal to see the truth or your lack of awareness to a problem perhaps you are rejecting something about yourself or your situation are you refusing to see any other point of view except your own consider the pun turning a blind eye try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  Psychoanalysis Dream Out-of-body experience Modernism Scientology beliefs and practices Sigmund Freud Consciousness Meditation Carl Jung Episodes of Lost (Season 2) A Course In Miracles Lucid dreaming Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus One Piece minor characters The Amber Spyglass Autism Milton H.

i have a dream nemesis why does she keep popping up okay a little back drop about my dreams i have lucid dreams all the time so for the most part i have control i am also tuff as nails i can be fighting zombies and kicking some major bum but be darned if this little nemesis keeps popping up it is basically a foot tall blond hair darkened out eyes porcline doll in a yellow and pink floral dress with curly hair and red ruby lips never seen this doll before i only see her in reflections and i am not even thinking about it i will be enjoying a lucid dream then look into a mirror and there she is behind me staring up at me with dark hollow eyes i just freeze up or wake up the way i have been dealing with it is just avoiding mirrors in lucid dreams the tricky hussy got around that by appearing in the reflection on a door handle when i turn around she isn't there but then i am too afraid to look back to the reflection how can something harmless like that cripple me when i have so much power in my dreams it could mean a couple of things do you have a friend or someone that you know that is perfect at almost everything if that's the case it could be that girl the perfect doll that seems to bug you because you think she's too perfect and flawless i've had a dream just like that except she wasn't a doll she was like everywhere in my dreams and everyone adored her or it could have to do with yourself since you're saying that you're tough as nails maybe there is a soft side to you a feminine side the cute dress the blonde hair to you that you want to come out but you feel it's going to change your life and might risk something also to dream that a doll comes to life signifies your desires to be someone else and escape from your present problems and responsibilities dolls may serve as a means to act out your wishes to see a doll in your dream symbolizes childhood innocence and light hearted fun those dreams are common you're spiritual self can take the place of any inanimate object and try to bring out some message  Lucid dreaming Characters of The Sandman W.I.T.C.H.

i keep have reoccuring dreams about tigers in my dreams i am very scared of this one tiger in the first dream i am in this huge dark manison like the house on beauty in the beast i am at this house with people i don't know i recall being told this tiger was someone's pet and to not worry about it i am in this enormous room with alot of books in it the tiger is in front of me and is staring very deeply and directly into my eyes i stare back i am very scared of this tiger and i can't seem to do anything expect to stare back the tiger doesn't try to attack me but he doesn't let me know i should feel at ease either he doesn't attack me but he doesn't stop letting me know he is watching my every move and could possibly attack any moment my second and third dream is pretty much the same thing expect in one dream i did slowly walk backwards until safe in another room in this huge dark castle i am staying in can anyone tell me what this dream means i keep having this same dream and i am still as scared of this tiger as i was in the first dream the dreams you are experiencing are called reccurring dreams there is something your subconscious mind is attempting to show you tell you once the message it needs you to understand becomes clear to you these dreams will end i looked up the dreams symbols offer some of my own interpretation along the way i am sorry this is long size to dream about the size of something represents the importance we attach to objects and person it also relates to the degree of power you are exerting and the power others have on you according to freudian school of thought the size of an object signifies the size of someone's penis perhaps your own or your lover huge mansion to see a mansion in your dream symbolizes your greatest potential and growth you may feel that your current situation or relationship is in a rut castle to see a castle in your dream signifies reward honor recognition and praise for your achievements it foretells that your future will be a happy one surrounded by the love of your children generosity of neighbors and comfort of friends you are destined to a position of power wealth and prestige people to see people you don't know in your dream denotes hidden aspects of yourself that you need to confront stranger to see a stranger in your dream signifies a part of yourself that is repressed and hidden alternatively it symbolizes the archetypal dream helper who is trying to offer some insight and advice people you don't know are strangers the tiger might be a male since you refer to he or perhaps represents a masculine side to your self within all men and women we have within each of us a feminine masculine side it is what we have gained from our parents our grandparents or close association with aunt's uncles or other adult friends relatives we have observed since our childhood tiger to see a tiger in your dream represents power and your ability to exert it in various situations the dream may also indicate that you to take more of a leadership role alternatively the tiger represents female sexuality aggression and seduction perhaps you are at odds with yourself this part of your nature seems more basic to you so appears in this form pet to see your or someone else's pet in your dream represents civilized instincts you are keeping your temper in line alternatively it indicates a need for love and acceptance you are lacking attention from others and are feeling neglected the pet may also be a pun for petting as in some sexual behavior lot's of books in an enormous size ref room in a mansion would be a personal library library to dream that you are in a library signifies the search for knowledge and the hunger for ideas you may be trying to seek out new meanings in life or you need to study and evaluate your situation before taking action if the library is disorganized suggests that too much information is coming at you at the same time you are having difficulty sorting it all out to see a library in your dream symbolizes the knowledge you have accumulated over the years staring to dream that you are staring at something or someone indicates that you need to take a much closer look at some situation or relationship perhaps you need to approach a situation from another perspective or viewpoint alternatively it represents your passivity you need to start taking action to dream that someone is staring at you suggests that you are hoping someone would look your way more often it may also represent anxiety or pride scared to dream that you are scared indicates that you are experiencing self doubt and feelings of incompetence you may be feeling a lack of control anger often masquerades as fear so also consider issues about which you are angry about in your waking life not able to do anything but stare back at the tiger immobile to dream that you are immobile signifies feelings of being trapped or that you are rigid in your attitudes and decisions he is watching my every move and could possibly attack any moment watching to dream that you are being watched suggests that you are feeling confined in your work environment or personal relationship you feel you are lacking a sense of privacy you are scared feel threatened by the tiger's presence though he doesn't attack threaten to dream that you are being threatened signifies that you have some internalized fear of inadequacy which needs to be addressed backward to dream that you are walking or moving backward signifies that what you are doing may be counter productive what you are seeking in life appears to be moving away from you thus you may be feeling a sense of failure or believe that you are unable to achieve your goals and aspirations on the other hand moving backward in your dream may symbolize that you should back off or retreat in a situation you may be facing in your waking life room to dream that you are in a room represents a particular aspect of yourself or a particular relationship dreams about various rooms often relate to hidden areas of the conscious mind and different aspects of your personality to dream that you find or discover new rooms suggests that you are developing new strengths and taking on new roles you may be growing emotionally you walked backward into another room where you felt safe to see an appealing or comfortable room in your dream signifies opulence and satisfaction in life huge size ref dark castle darkness to dream that darkness comes upon you signifies failure in work you may attempt darkness is synonymous with ignorance the unconscious evil death and fear of the unknown if the sun breaks through the darkness then you will overcome your failures if you feel safe in the dark then it suggests that you like not knowing about certain things as some might say ignorance is bliss to dream that you are lost in the darkness denotes feelings of desperation depression or insecurity to dream that you are groping around in the darkness indicates that you have insufficient information to make a clear decision do your research and do not rush into making choices i feel this might be more the appropriate definition as you describe the castle as one out of beauty the beast it is huge dark unfamiliar to you so you are uncertain what to expect seem to be left to fend for yourself in a sense you are groping for answers it is odd with all the people there that they only tell you not to worry nobody seems to be concerned perhaps the only real danger to fear is that which places limitations within yourself on yourself that prevents you to live your life as fully as you would like without worry  Hypnosis Unconscious mind Force (Star Wars) Ranma __ characters Child sexual abuse Incarnations of

how is it we see ppl in our dreams whom we have never come across or met or never seen i see soo many ppl in my dreams who i have never encountered with then how is it possible that i see them according to dreamcrowd it is very common to dream about all kinds of faces strange faces and familiar faces alike are frequent images in our dreams interpret your dream by considering the face and the general content of the dream a stranger's face could represent different parts of your personality or psyche you think that you are seeing a stranger but in actuality you are seeing a different part of yourself jung said that the stranger is a part of you that comes from the unconscious a comic face may indicate that you have a conscious or unconscious need to mock or snub the conventional featureless faces suggest that you may feel unnoticed and unappreciated on the other hand some believe that the blank or unclear face represents a teacher that is someone who is there to show and teach you a lesson but you are unprepared for it and the face is blank smiling faces are representative of happy thoughts and feelings and possibly anticipation of a joyful event in the near future always remember the compensatory nature of dreams and their ability to point to the opposite of what you experience in daily life try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  Carl Jung Dream Consciousness Unconscious mind Analytical psychology Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Collective unconscious Psychoanalysis James Hillman Oneiromancy Fictional character Alexander Technique Karen Horney Lucid dreaming Arthur Schopenhauer Free will Happiness Narcissism Meaning of life The nature of God in Western theology Gestalt therapy The Giver Artificial consciousness Near-death experience Drama Carlos Castaneda Philosophical skepticism Current teachings of Prem Rawat Scenes from a Memory Jungian psychology Modernism Michel Henry Cyberspace Episodes of Lost (Season 1) A Course In Miracles Edgar Cayce Synchronicity Shadow (psychology) Shaggy dog story Poker jargon Characters of The Sandman Myers-Briggs Type Indicator God Emperor of Dune Theory of conduct Objectivist philosophy Eyes Wide Shut Jiddu Krishnamurti Stranger (Myst) Socrates Milton H.

what do these recurring dream themes mean i have several recurring themes and images in my dream and it really bugs me i figure if they keep coming back they must mean something or contain some sort of message and i'd like to know what really fish i have a phobia of fish in real life although whether this came before or as a result of the dreams i don't know i can't think of any logical reason why i'm scared of fish or recall any traumatic events linked to fish in my childhood in my dreams i usually dream about pet fish and they are usually multiplying rapidly or growing very big dirty toilets often i dream of looking for a toilet but finding they are all dirty broken or overflowing or i start to use one and then find there are lots of people who can see me trains i went through a stage of dreaming about getting on the wrong train a lot but now its more to do with stations and getting to the right platform on time can anyone shed any light on what these dreams might mean fish to see fish swimming in your dream signifies insights from your unconscious mind thus to catch a fish represents insights which have been brought to the surface the fish is also an ancient symbol of christianity and christian beliefs consider also the common phrases like a cold fish fish out of water or something that is fishy about a situation it may also imply a slippery or elusive situation to dream that you are eating fish symbolizes your beliefs spirituality luck energy and nourishment it is food for the soul to see a dead fish signifies disappointment and loss of power wealth to dream of cooking fish indicates that you are incorporating your new realizations with your spiritual feelings and knowledge if you are cleaning fish then it suggests that you are altering your emotional expression in a way that will be presentable to others you are censoring yourself and not expressing how you completely feel toilet to see a toilet in your dream symbolizes a release of emotions or getting rid of something in your life that is useless if you are cleaning the toilet then it means that you are starting to shed your shell or lose your inhibitions to see a clogged toilet in your dream signifies that you are holding in and keeping your feelings to yourself your emotions have been pent up too long to see an overflowing toilet in your dream denotes your desires to fully express your emotions trains to see a train in your dream represents conformity and go along with what everyone else is doing you have the need to do things in an orderly and sequential manner in particular if you see a freight train then it refers to the burdens and problems that you are hauling around to dream that you are on a train is symbolic of your life's journey and suggests that you are on the right track in life and headed for the right direction alternatively you have a tendency to worry needlessly over a situation that will prove to work out in the end to dream that you are the engineer signifies that you are in complete control of a particular situation in your waking life to dream that you miss a train denotes missed opportunities or nearly escaping your death  Dream Meaning of life Simone Weil Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infantilism Animism Phaedo Numerology Lucid dreaming Shit Psychoanalysis Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Carl Jung Urinary incontinence Sigmund Freud W.I.T.C.H.

weird combination in a dream i dreamt all these things yesterday one was where i was in a bastketball or netball team not sure and i couldnt even catch the ball then there was this other part where i was late for an appointmant then the other one where i was fighting or was disappointed with my brother and another one where my mother was telling someone that she was disspointed in me what does this mean i have seen these dreams seperately before also except for the brother thing i think couldn't even catch the ball losing control late for appointment stress anxiety fighting with your brother seeking for admiral guilty feeling being disappointed by mother regret low self esteem it could mean that once you are losing your control you will feel bad and you may be feeling guilty about things you cannot do or take charge and that caused anxiety and anxiety may lead to low self esteem and confidence and so you are losing control again putting them together you may be seeking for support in regaining control in life you don't want to feel low because you are not looked up on you want to take charge but some how you can't you may blame it for others for not praising you or encourage this may come from your mother in short you may need some encouragement  Knots Landing EastEnders Narcissism Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Days of our Lives Alex Ferguson Anxiety Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Sydney Riot of 1879 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 History of Test cricket (to 1883) Sigmund Freud God Emperor of Dune Brian Close Norway national football team Indian Oil Cup 2005 Gordon Banks The Contender (television series) Strategic management Charlie Brown Cris Carter The Catcher in the Rye Cleveland Browns New York Giants Neville Chamberlain Obsessive-compulsive disorder Ben Johnson (athlete) Karen Horney W.I.T.C.H.

the same nightmare i keep ignoring these dreams and warnings i don't know i pray about them push them to the side of my head and attempt to let them go i keep seeing the same car he had i ignore it then for the the past week i dreamed of him everynight i wake up upset the more i ignore them the stronger they are are these just simple dreams warnings or my paranoia either way i'm sick of them i can't sleep you are not paranoid you will stop being sick of these horrible nightmares and you will actually start to enjoy them once you have fun seeing what they mean figuring them out like a puzzle once you start to see them on the screen of your mind like a movie you've written for you to watch and heal and grow and learn from by enjoy them i mean you will have the full catharsis of their pain not the pulling away which causes more pain and by understanding they will go away okay i know you're tired of being hurt so let's start on an adventure and keep that hurt away from you your dream one of the most important aspects of your description is that you avoid saying who he is what does this mean you are trying so hard to avoid him but this causes you deep deep conflict we cannot ever run from our fears or conflicts we must face them head on and deal with them and work to fix them your dreams are saying the same thing it is not paranoia they are not simple dreams or warnings they are very clear signs that you are in deep conflict with this person and that whether with friends or a therapist or someone else that you trust you need to resolve this conflict not pretend it doesn't exist not abandon it karen horney said and i love it that anxiety is to emotions what pain is to a wound it tells you that something is wrong needs healing or will get worse you say all this yourself the more i ignore them the stronger they get if you left a wound open without cleansing bandaging an antibiotic salve it would fester get pus and maybe even gangrene so too with an emotional wound it won't be ignored it is also of note that you refer to the car you give very few details so the ones you give are important clearly you want him to come back but in a way that he no longer hurts you or you want him to drive away and leave you alone forever you put the car in your nightmare so remember it is up to you to drive this person away by taking it into your hands and resolving this conflict facing how why you allowed him to have this power over you how why you continue to give him this power over you and your feelings i'm sure you don't want to hear this but what can i say do you remember as a child if you didn't make up with mommy or daddy the pain was excruciating that doesn't change with grown up relationships you don't have to literally make up with a person who has hurt you but you do have to heal to make peace with that person in your mind and heart you must forgive in order to forget you must find out exactly why this person has such a deep hold on your whole ego integrity and in that healing that forgiveness you will forget and move on your dreams are your best friends and they are trying to help you to see the truth after all they didn't come from the sky think of this you write your own dreams it is your unconscious trying to tell your conscious that you have hurts that won't be ignored that must be faced and taken care of all the best to you and know that sleep and peace will come to you when you've done the hard work of repairing your inner relationship to this person and letting him go not by denial not be avoidance but by genuine moving on and when you begin to see that it's fun to analyze and confront and feel the heaviness just flow off you just drift away with the realization that you've conquered what it was about and you've looked the enemy in the eye and it wasn't you lol  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) Shaggy dog story Narcissism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an W.I.T.C.H.

am i psychic or plain stupid i have dreams about strange creatures that dont even exist supernatural stuff mostly some female spirit who tries to harm me n i start chanting prayers loudly snakes those which dont really exist and some other animals which look weird im scared i fear sleeping alone at night what do u think people i don't want to sound like a professional christian here i am just a broken sinner and believe in the christian faith not so much from my study but from my experiences and answers to prayers i do know that angels appeared to people in dreams in the scriptures it also says that in the later days old men will dream dreams and young men will see visions i personally don't think the people who wrote the inspired word of god were thinking only men and not women would have this or that see this or that etc i think they just weren't all that pc and used men instead of men women so in my view women will dream dreams and see visions as well i do believe that there are two realms good and evil if you are dreaming of a female spirit who is trying to harm you then it makes sense and you are using good innate instincts to chant prayers loudly if you will recall or perhaps you haven't heard i'm sorry for taking it for granted that you have but in scripture satan appeared in the form of a serpent in the garden of eden so he could be trying to mess with your head in your sleep the really wonderful news is that you can relax and know that satan was defeated on the cross he cannot harm you don't be afraid to sleep alone because jesus said i will never leave you nor forsake you this could just be your wakeup call that it's time to make a decision to yield to god and ask him to protect you and keep you and give you a peaceful night's sleep if you own a bible i would encourage you to read philippians chapter verses through if you don't have a bible i will write it out for you and you can read it over and over and be thankful that greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world i do not know you but i hope that someday i see you in heaven and god will say hey you two were blogging to each other when you should have been sleeping august but i'm glad you blogged cause things got better and the stupid dreams stopped by the way you are not stupif satan is just trying to make you feel stupid rob you of your joy and frighten you he' a jerk we have the power throught the name of jesus to stomp him under our feet he is powerless in the presence of the name of jesus ok now here comes the verses i was telling you about philippians rejoice in the lord always i will say it again rejoice let your gentleness be evident to all the lord is near do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving present your requests to god and the peace of god which passes all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus finally brothers and sister's quotations mine this is also mine here comes the good part whatever is true whatever is noble whatever is right whatever is pure whatever is lovely whatever is admirable if anything is excellent or praiseworthy think about such things sweet woman be thankful for these bad dreams because they may have woken you up to the beautiful power in praying for them to go away please google the lyrics to the song river god by nicole nordeman it is a beautiful illustration of how the difficult things in our lives are what smooth us out much like the way a river rock tumbles over the hard rocks and gets smashed around and hurt only to come out in the end smooth and more beautiful as a result of the difficulty along the journey to become perfected please know that i will pray for you tonight that you sleep safely in the hollow of our father's hand you are loved in fact he is crazy about you now go to bed sweet girl  Angel Epistle to the Philippians Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism God Roman Catholic Church Holy Spirit Satan

i have dreams from years ago and they are coming true is this normal people's names what people say events themes stick out which i remember and a few months or years later they come true i also pick up on what people say about me and find out it is the truth faces also stick out for me and feelings and places i see i have seen before in dreams in my dreams i also travel to places and meet people and have conversations and continue to visit the same people night after night is astro travel possible there are things in life that cannot be explained of course they are possible however most of the times dream come from experience and experience give us idea in the subconscious mind and that leads to another new experience for example if you dream of plane and the next day you found out the news a plane did crash you may think that comes true and you may have some sort of power but looking back plane crash was a fact and happens before that lurks into our mind and live in our subconscious mind so if that happens in your dream and the next day it happens again that may be called coincident in other words you already have an idea that plane would crash in the other example dream of zombie and if you dream of it and the next day someone you know die okay zombie will never in our mind if you don't have knowledge about it base on the knowledge you have first then you dream about if in the event that happens you can say they symbolize people will die in your case faces sticking out and come true in reality that is probably from your experience a quick flash from one's person nose the other person's eyes may lurk into your mind and the next day a look alike person may reveal in reality and you may make yourself believe that it comes true same goes with travel to places we dream because we base on our experience sometimes our experience may indicate it is from the dream it seems like the cycle but actually comes from our life time experience first of course i don't rule out exception but i do not think it happens to many people though  Theory of conduct Social rule Lucid dreaming Unconscious mind Out-of-body experience Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Infantilism Carlos Castaneda The Mother Philosophical skepticism Epistemology Scenes from a Memory Derren Brown Jon Secada Michel Henry Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Scientology beliefs and practices Tag The nature of God in Western theology StarCraft: Uprising The Amber Spyglass God Victor Cousin Jiddu Krishnamurti Cliff Richard American Pie (song) Free will God Emperor of Dune Time Out of Mind Past teachings of Prem Rawat K' Consciousness Carl Jung Reality Rain Man Avenue Q Religion Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sant Thakar Singh Discordianism The Invisibles Meaning of life Socrates Book of Mormon Gundam Phaedo Resident Evil: Apocalypse Slow Train Coming Miracle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) 9/11 conspiracy theories Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Philosophy of language Spiritism Donald Davidson (philosopher) Numerology Augustus De Morgan EastEnders Apocalypse Mantra Scientific method One Tree Hill (TV series) Dualism (philosophy of mind) Miss Saigon Muraqaba Rudolf Hermann Lotze Objectivist philosophy Hypnosis Philosophy of mathematics Sabbath Critique of Pure Reason Myers-Briggs Type Indicator The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Aristotle Human Empathy Shen Gong Wu Paranoia Agent Friedrich Schleiermacher Astral projection W.I.T.C.H.

scary odd dreams has anyone ever had one of these types of dreams where you wake up in the middle of it because your whole body feels the same way your foot feels when it falls asleep i've had that happen several times to me and it's like i'm pinned down but i'm totally awake i can't talk i can't move and sometimes i can hear an ugly faint voice can't make out what it's saying but i hear something and i feel like there's a presence in the room i have read about it and i've heard it can be sleep paralysis but one time i felt like something jumped off my chest in the same way it would feel if a cat jumped off you if it was on your lap crazy my sister twin says she had dreams like this before in fact when we were little we used to sleep in the same bed sometimes so it wouldn't happen again anyone have a similar experience i've told my mom about it she's a waaay christian religous person so of course she chalked it up to bad spirits opinions anyone some would call it lucid dreaming if you are into that sort of thing that is to say you are open to certain ideas some would dismiss i would look into something called astral projection people who claim to experience lucid dreaming or maybe it was astral projection people who said this describe a feeling pretty similar to yours lucid dreaming is the state of being conscious while you are still asleep this means you can control your dreams to an extent a certain method of lucid dreaming involves the sleep paralysis you speak of that might actually be astral projection i'm not sure if that is considered a different concept or an extension of lucid dreaming either way lucky you well i guess not really because of the feeling it gives you because it's actually a pretty rare phenomenon to wake up like that and a lot of people try to achieve it so they can manipulate it the part about feeling like there's a presence again if you are accepting to such concepts you might have a ghost in your house who is waking you up in that state on purpose some people are more perceptive to that sort of thing than others for example my cousin and my aunt live in a house with a ghost and they are the only two people who have experienced any sort of odd occurrences despite the fact that her family of has lived in that house for well over years edit whilst reading up on lucid dreaming i think i found something that is exactly like what you are describing it's called hypnagogia you should read the wikipedia article on it it is extremely similar to what you said  Astral projection Dream Hypnagogia Philosophical skepticism Milton H.

how is it possible to dream of someone you've never met and never seen in my dreams the person exists with shape and form but has no 'real' physical details but they're there almost like a shadow but as more than that according to dreamcrowd it is very common to dream about all kinds of faces strange faces and familiar faces alike are frequent images in our dreams interpret your dream by considering the face and the general content of the dream a stranger's face could represent different parts of your personality or psyche you think that you are seeing a stranger but in actuality you are seeing a different part of yourself jung said that the stranger is a part of you that comes from the unconscious a comic face may indicate that you have a conscious or unconscious need to mock or snub the conventional featureless faces suggest that you may feel unnoticed and unappreciated on the other hand some believe that the blank or unclear face represents a teacher that is someone who is there to show and teach you a lesson but you are unprepared for it and the face is blank smiling faces are representative of happy thoughts and feelings and possibly anticipation of a joyful event in the near future always remember the compensatory nature of dreams and their ability to point to the opposite of what you experience in daily life try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation  Dream Carl Jung Consciousness Unconscious mind Sigmund Freud James Hillman Yoga Sutras of Patanjali The nature of God in Western theology Narcissism Artificial consciousness Analytical psychology Karen Horney Collective unconscious Free will A Course In Miracles Alexander Technique Lucid dreaming Meaning of life Cyberspace Past teachings of Prem Rawat Oneiromancy Drama God Emperor of Dune Gestalt therapy Happiness Near-death experience Synchronicity Shadow (psychology) Michel Henry Modernism Eyes Wide Shut Philosophical skepticism The Giver Animism Carlos Castaneda Theory of conduct Current teachings of Prem Rawat Out-of-body experience Socrates Stranger (Myst) Narrator Scientology beliefs and practices Human nature Edgar Cayce Soul Human Polyhedron Anthroposophy Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Death of a Salesman Jungian psychology Dualism (philosophy of mind) Religion Scenes from a Memory Supernatural Objectivist philosophy Jiddu Krishnamurti Doctor (Doctor Who) Shaggy dog story Drawing Rudolf Steiner Characters of The Sandman Sri Aurobindo Mojave people Friedrich Schleiermacher Alcoholics Anonymous Transactional analysis The Amber Spyglass Salad Fingers Traumatic incident reduction Unidentified flying object Existentialism Glossary of partner dance terms Determinism Sin City Causality Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Mind Poker jargon Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Irony Tarot Saga (band) Philosophy of perception Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Master (Doctor Who) Aikido Shadow the Hedgehog W.I.T.C.H.

flying in dreams using swimming movements why when i have dreams about flying the seem very real oh well anyway i usually fly just one metre above the ground so it's very low and my body is actually swimming to move forwards it's really interesting and quite realistic any similar experiences or explanations lol if you are flying with ease and enjoying the scene and landscape below then it suggests that you are on top of a situation you have risen above something it may also mean that you have gained a different perspective on things flying dreams and the ability to control your flight is representative of your own personal sense of power having difficulties staying in flight indicates a lack of power in controlling your own circumstances you may be struggling to stay aloft and stay on course things like power lines trees or mountains may further obstruct your flight these barriers represent a particular obstacle or person who is standing in your way in your waking life you need to identify who or what is hindering you from moving forward if you are feeling fear when you are flying or that you feel that you are flying too high then it suggests that you are afraid of challenges and of success another way of interpreting flying dreams is that these dreams symbolize your strong mind and will you feel undefeatable and nobody can tell you what you cannot do and accomplish  Dream Super Mario 64 Fixed-wing aircraft Out-of-body experience Gliding Autism Paragliding Drowning Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Diving W.I.T.C.H.

nightmares of my ex serious this is really scary i was at my school early in the morning wayyyy before the sun was u with a girl that i used to be best friends with my father whom i havent talked to in over monthes anyways as me the girl were in the back of the car waiting to get out then we pulled up my dad starts looking out the dash window like he is looking for someone then i said bye dad love you he just starts nodding then we hop out the car i said comon we have to go to school she wouldent come i said w e then i kept walking then some one in all black jumped out of the bushes shot me in my dream i opened eyes saw my ex's face what does that mean dreams about being at school often mean you are feeling inescure about your social status your abilities or your performance in a situation a dream that takes place in school may also be a metaphor for the lessons you are learning in your life im not so sure about your friendship with that girl but if this is the case then to see a friend in your dream who you no longer see in real life the friendship is over or they moved away means you wish for a time in your past when you had no responsibilities and things were much simpler and more carefree you may be wanting to escape the the pressures and stresses of growing up or it could be a signal that it's time to start acting more mature to see your father in your dream symbolizes authority and protection it suggests that you need to be more self reliant if you are in the backseat of a car your dream indicates that you let others tell you what to do possibly due to low self confidence im not sure this helps but black symbolizes the unknown the unconscious danger mystery and malice to see bushes in your dream symbolizes obstacles that are blocking your progress if you get shot you will be annoyed by a nasty person if you hear the sound of shooting in your dream this means that selfishness will be the cause of unhappiness between you and someone you love i think this dream symbol is the one you need to pay close attention to because of its significance to dream about your ex boyfriend suggests that something or someone in your current life is bringing out similar feelings to the ones you felt in the relationship with your ex the dream may be a way of alerting you to the same or similar behavior in a current relationship what you learned from that previous relationship may need to be applied to the present one so that you do not repeat the same mistake that's all i could find good luck  Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Scenes from a Memory Pitaten One Tree Hill (TV series) W.I.T.C.H.

has any had a dream were they r fallin well wat happens if in those kinds of dreams u hit the ground i'm falling falling dreams are another theme that is quite common in the world of dreams contrary to a popular myth you will not actually die if you do not wake up before your hit the ground during a fall as with most common dream themes falling is an indication of insecurities instabilities and anxieties you are feeling overwhelmed and out of control in some situation in your waking life this may reflect the way you feel in your relationship or in your work environment you have lost your foothold and can not hang on or keep up with the hustle and bustle of daily life when you fall there is nothing that you can hold on to you more or less are forced toward this downward motion without any control this lost of control may parallel a waking situation in your life falling dreams also often reflect a sense of failure or inferiority in some circumstance or situation it may be the fear of failing in your job school loss of status or failure in love you feel shameful and lack a sense of pride you are unable to keep up with the status quo or that you don't measure up according to freudian theory dreams of falling indicate that you are contemplating giving into a sexual urge or impulse you maybe lacking indiscretion falling dreams typically occur during the first stage of sleep dreams in this stage are often accompanied by muscle spasms of the arms legs and the whole body these sudden contractions also known as myclonic jerks sometimes when we have these falling dreams we feel our whole body jerk or twitch and we awaken from this jerk it is thought that this jerking action is part of an arousal mechanism that allows the sleeper to awaken and become quickly alert and responsive to possible threats in the environment according to biblical interpretations dreams about falling have a negative overtone and suggest that man is acting and walking according to his own way of thinking and not those of the lord  Sigmund Freud Out-of-body experience Karen Horney Urinary incontinence Rape Sleep Dog Narcolepsy Clinical depression Child sexuality Dream Milton H.
