what is the skiing like in killington vermont hi i'm planning to head to killington for some skiing in early feb does anyone know what the snow and slopes should be like then thanks well the snow will be fine hard maybe icy and the slopes will be crowded unless you go on a weekday it will be less so i actually don't recommend killington if you have a choice go further north to stowe or magic or bolton valley or mad river glen or jay peak all those areas see fewer crowds from nyc anyways that's my opinion  Killington, Vermont Vermont Skiing Lake Tahoe Appalachian Mountains Yosemite National Park Avalanche Cross-country skiing Snowboarding Appalachian Trail Mountaineering Alta Ski Area Colorado Salt Lake County, Utah Ski Fraser Valley Regional District, British Columbia Montana Pikes Peak Cascade Range Utah Geology of the Appalachians Glen Coe Telemark skiing Whistler-Blackcomb Andes Stowe, Vermont Lyne Bessette Long Island Rail Road Bay Area Rapid Transit Anchorage, Alaska Portland, Oregon Alpine skiing Aerial tramway Independent Subway System Northeast Corridor Enclave Tongariro National Park New York Central Railroad Zion National Park Howard Dean Catskill State Park Tiger I Edmonton, Alberta Geography of Alberta Mount Rainier New Hampshire West Coast Range (Tasmania) Allen Sarven Snowboard The Slippery Slope Salt Lake City, Utah William N.
