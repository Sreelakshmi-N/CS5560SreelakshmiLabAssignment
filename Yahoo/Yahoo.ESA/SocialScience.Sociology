used and emotionally abused why aren't i worthy it's rlly long but please help me i was severely depressed a month and a half ago i let myself get sexually taken advantage by my boyfriend and than i broke up with him but to make it worst begged him to take me back he of course did not because he was never serious about me than there was my ex ex boyfriend the one before this one we went out very beriefly but things ended rather abruptly so i called him years later to find some sort of closure he agreed to meet up with me we had our first kiss together that night it was amazing i text him a couple of days later i wish i kissed you longer and he text back ' yea it was good and than text again i wish it was longer now today he text me if i wanted to hang out and i said sure but i have an early curfew but he never got back to me all day he is leaving for college tomorrow i guess i was just a booty call in all honesty i felt like he was the love of my life i never stopped caring loving for him i know its crazy but i felt like he was the one so realizing that i was just a booty call to him made me feel so stupid especially considering i loved him i am going back into the severe depression state again i know because i feel so unloved and unworthy of anyones love i never had anyone love me before i've always been single my whole life i have been way too patient where is the happiness they say all bad thing end in happiness i have yet to see it i've only had two boyfriends in my life and i am this is what they've done to me i don't have much friends either they are twofaced and no one cares enough to call my parents well i never hear i love you from them maybe every years or so they'd say it once i feel so alone i don't know what to do every guy that ever showed interest turned out to only want sex i am so sick of it i always give my all in relationships i show love i buy gifts cook surprise write sweet things what is wrong with me happiness true happiness like the kind i believe you seek can only come from one place within a mistake a lot of people make is they become what i like to call externally motivated meaning they look outside at other people's lives to determine what should run their own the happiest people in the world the ones who are natural and social and even successful in life are internally motivated they have set core beliefs that are unshakable there's so much philosophy that goes into this answer but the nuts and bolts of it is this the only one that can determine how much you are worth is you your thoughts and opinions about yourself show and other people pick up on that you have to love yourself and know you determine your value imagine this for me really for you if you lived a dream life what would be in it who would be in it look passed your current house your current status and use your imagination how would your ideal man see you do this with everything you see and you will begin to love your surroundings and most importantly you will find the deepest kind of love for yourself  One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule The Ashlee Simpson Show Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Kodocha Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Abortion debate Laura Schlessinger Past teachings of Prem Rawat About a Boy Avenue Q W.I.T.C.H.

what a students can do to make the obesity awareness campaign a success i think there is more than enough 'obesity awareness' in the u s to go around already it is constantly talked about i think students should concentrate on why they're at school for their education and leave the other students alone unless you want to simply be friends with them leave their weight out of it period end it's their own business and they're probably just as smart as you are and just as aware already anyway maybe you could start a campaign to be concerned about all the anorexic young people out there so obsessed about their weight that they often starve to death  Anorexia nervosa Pro-ana Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Binge eating disorder Order of the British Empire Autism rights movement Out-of-body experience Atherosclerosis Friends Kare Kano Ravenloft domains Jiddu Krishnamurti Social rule Boston Public Grade (education) Student loan Saved by the Bell Peter Shilton University of Central Florida Students' union Eating disorder High school Body mass index Pitaten __udov__t __t__r Motivation School choice Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Gifted Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire April 2005 in Canada Ally McBeal Voluntary Student Unionism Hogwarts subjects Azumanga Daioh Teach the Controversy Dieting Leeds United F.C.

what are the cultural differences between england and america any answer between two very varied groups of people has to be purposefully vague even if you limit it to just the english rather than all the british peoples on the whole without going into the murky area of the english idea of class there are only two huge generalisations that come to mind americans are polite the english are proper an american will tell you they are good an english person would rather you not i would take point to encompass more generally an american liking of rules and regulations while the english preference for unwritten common sense in appropriate action for point american society is more self cantered combatitive and for want of better words egotistical an american will come in and say i know you should do it this way and fall flat on their face if they get it wrong the english would rather show appropriate respect to other peoples positions as it is likely that someone else will know best even if their position is good this can lead to american thinking that brits are snobs for not giving time to their opinions and the brits thinking americans are just being loud and self important not realising that person x over there is an expert in it you can often find this in conversation that an american will be quite happy to give their views and sound knowledgeable on many subjects you will have to prise any detailed pov from an englishman after much questioning but they will generally know a whole lot more than they first let on i would disagree that any answer is a result of age of civilisation or perceived american multiculturalism middle american main street is very similar to the english town high street in terms of cultural variation some will point out large cultural differences in the big cities but major english cities have this too london is at least as multicultural as new york the us maybe founded on immigrants but the uk has be trading people with europe for millennia has local cultures e g the cornish running back over centuries and had huge waves of immigration from the empire both cultures as they are perceived today are a result of the industrial revolution creating the modern metropolis and the subsequent universal suffrage and institutions that this produced modern england was created out of the english civil war which is not far removed from the first major us colonisations and the declaration of independence  Sociocultural evolution Democracy England Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Theory of conduct Constitution Black (people) Appeal Anglosphere Human Prime Minister of the United Kingdom American Revolution Multiculturalism City Postmodernism Common law Republic Objectivist philosophy State Cultural relativism Who is a Jew?

palgiarism copy and paste and the internet how do you think the current culture of internet plagiarism will play out in education and creative thinking in the near future on the one hand technology has made plagiarism so easy that it seems endemic do you think that is so on the other hand technology is also making tools for checking for plagiarism easily available hey lemur i think you are right but teachers can't do it on their own without support from administrators taxpayers parents it is much too daunting a task for an individual to take on that is why i ask the question cutting copying and pasting is not a good way to cheat especially in college all someone has to do is type in a portion of a paper into a search engine like yahoo or google and it will more than likely come right up in college we often have to submit our work into a site called turnitin com and it shows exactly where we got our work the percentage of information we took from different places and if we reworded it or not the best way to plagiarize for a student today is to pay someone else to do your paper although i wouldnt do it expensive basically students can only plagiarize if an institution allows it what im saying is that talk is cheap many institutions will talk about the severity and consequences of plagiarism but wont do anything to catch it while others will have the same policies and scope out the cheaters  Plagiarism Open access Education in the People's Republic of China Education Intellectual property Jayson Blair Education in Japan Computer Open source culture Academic publishing Legal research Digital rights management Scholarship Cheating in Counter-Strike Affirmative action Technology Software patent debate Princeton University Open Directory Project Steam (content delivery) Education in Portugal Hey Jude FairTax Student loan Gmail Academia Burkhard Heim Privatization Extreme Programming Literacy Google search Neopets Librarian Slashdot trolling phenomena Microsoft Theory of conduct Newbie No Child Left Behind Act Cheating Microeconomics Science Life insurance Unemployment Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 BitTorrent Enterprise content management Education in Germany Jeff Gannon 2005 Philippine electoral crisis Mirror (computing) RuneScape cheats Google Grade (education) Search engine University of Pennsylvania E-mail spam Book Social Security debate (United States) Lyceum of the Philippines Massachusetts Institute of Technology Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Redundant array of independent disks PHP Athabasca University College admissions Franklin W.

are you an empath who is too sensitive and do you ever look at the world as an increasingly harsh and difficult place to live in are you tired of the flashing lights and the screaming senseless tv the blaring radio the internet in general and the cruel and senselessness of human nature please share with me and how do you deal with it hi contact when the sounds and sights of the world are too much for me i pull my head in my shell i find a place that is quiet and dark and i rest using solid principals of psychology i ease my feelings of negativity and replace then with positive feelings it takes time and experience for this to work well but i've been at it for a long time now another more important part of my ability to calm myself is my practice of buddhism we chant nam myoho renge kyo which harmonizes our lives with the universe this gives me the wisdom to see the stressors coming and to reduce their effect on me it also puts me in the right place to avoid situations that would be harmful for me one of the stressors you mentioned is the tv the commercials are especially jarring and annoying so i use the remote to mute the commercials thus reducing the stressful noise i am sensitive to since even answering questions here on answers can be stressful i will answer fewer questions at times i am an artist so i also have learned to channel my sensitivity into my art fortunately the lights and sirens are temporary events i have also learned to let go of along with many other irritants that might have been a problem at one time  Stress (medicine) Post-traumatic stress disorder Mantra Clinical depression Nam Myoho Renge Kyo Stuttering Meditation Infantilism Tank Photography Breastfeeding Internet troll Numerology Modernism Nichiren Consciousness Fermi paradox Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Defence mechanism Surveillance Fruits Basket Scientology beliefs and practices Motivation Autism Mandala Modem Alexander Technique Empathy Microphone Martial art Animal testing Explosive material God Emperor of Dune Psychology Asperger syndrome Spanking Chronic fatigue syndrome Prank flash Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Religion Light pollution Equine conformation Psoriasis Simone Weil Rain Man Sleep Violin Crash test dummy Digital photography Singlish Urinary incontinence Items in the Metroid series Sexual orientation Hypnosis Determinism Rudolf Hermann Lotze Aikido Coeliac disease Wassily Kandinsky The Velvet Underground Hiking Goodness and value theory Drug addiction Second language acquisition Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Ludwig Wittgenstein Socrates Whose Line Is It Anyway?

how can i learn to be less sensitive i have a very hard time not taking personal offense to any negative comment or vibe that comes my way i get very emotional whenever someone accuses me of something or points out one of my faults mistakes how can i become more guarded without becoming overly caloused how can i learn to stand up for myself the only way to become less sensitive is to accept the fact that the world isn't out to criticize you everyone needs a reminder once in a while that they're human so don't be offended if someone offers you advice on how to improve something as for taking personal offense to negative vibes you're probably misreading people if this happens a lot take it from someone who has learned the hard way you are your own worst critic when you can understand and come to terms with that you'll be more comfortable with other's opinions be proud of who you are and the decisions you make and remember to keep a positive outlook on life  A Course In Miracles Internet troll Sin Transactional analysis Alcoholics Anonymous Shit Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Slander and libel Theory of conduct Pedophilia Political correctness Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) God Emperor of Dune Polyamory Esperanto as an international language The nature of God in Western theology Plame affair Traumatic incident reduction Emotional intelligence Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Surveillance The Apprentice 2 God and gender Past teachings of Prem Rawat Time Out of Mind Humphrey Bogart Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Rape Zoophilia Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Blood on the Tracks Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Sexual orientation Cultural relativism Alexander Technique 2005 United States Grand Prix Lie Numerology Emotions (album) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Capital punishment Abortion debate Happiness Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Nuanced voices on the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Child sexual abuse Arguments for and against drug prohibition Whose Line Is It Anyway?

charisma how do i make myself feel more secure or love myself be comfortable with who i am not be afraid to talk to anyone i hate it when no one answers my question so i'm going to answer yours so ways to feel more secure with who you are there really are tons of ways a great first step is to be secure with your personality you need to be who you are so your friends will like you for the real you and not who you have to put up a front to be once you're comfortable with who you are you need to be more comfortable with your appearance sure looks aren't everything but you sure are going to feel better about yourself knowing that you look damn good improve your posture sure this sounds ridiculous but it's going to be the first thing that people notice when they looks at you don't close yourself off to people by folding your arms in front of you carry yourself like you know that you're sexy people with slumped shoulders and lethargic movements display a lack of self confidence they aren t enthusiastic about what they re doing and they don t consider themselves important ways to make you feel better about yourself is to focus on your accomplishments not what is going to happen or what you want and can't have you ll be amazed how much you have going for you and you'll be motivated to take that next step towards feeling more secure you can also make yourself feel better by complimenting other people tell other people that they look good if they do compliment their specific skills you ll become well liked and build self confidence looking for the good in others brings out the good in yourself another good way to feel good about yourself is to work out if you re out of shape you ll feel insecure unattractive and less energetic try a few of these out even if you think some are corny they all work really you have to love yourself before others will feel the need to you need to be comfortable with who you are because i'm sure you're a really special person  Theory of conduct Mojave people Milton H.

what are some popular philosophies other than philosophical buddism i know of some such as nihilism and paeganism but i was wondering what other types of spirituality are popular some of my favorite philosophies are those of existentialism and philosophical tao though these have some ideas contradicting one another they all make very good points soren kierkegaard's existentialism states that every man will inevitably fall into a state of malaise but through repetition of the best past experiences and putting yourelf in new situations then you may make your life a truly free experience the philosophy of tao can truly be summed up by the tao te ching of lao tzu one must never do anything for only when nothing is done is nothing left undone tao may be compared rather closely to buddhism but they are actually quite different but read the tao te ching the sickness unto death either or and repetition for a background on both of these  Taoism Tao Te Ching Philosophy Existentialism Laozi S__ren Kierkegaard I Ching Buddhism Thelema Determinism Metaphysics Atheism Martin Heidegger Goodness and value theory Eastern philosophy Postmodernism Anarchism and religion Tao Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Leo Strauss Existence Moral objectivism Ken Wilber Alan Watts Essence Philosophy of science Modernism Deconstruction Reality Reincarnation Culture of China Sri Aurobindo Mantra Koan History of literature Free will Simone Weil Falsifiability Nihilism Jean-Paul Sartre Karl Jaspers Wu wei I-Kuan Tao Predestination Tai Chi Chuan Confucius Chinese classic texts Religion Continental philosophy Friedrich Nietzsche Force (Star Wars) Spiritual evolution Samael Aun Weor Libertarianism Karl Marx Neo-Confucianism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Lev Shestov Soul Causality Thomas Carlyle Origin belief Negative theology Zhuangzi Laws of Form Jewish philosophy Philosophy of language David Hume Socrates Fernando Pessoa Reinhold Niebuhr Advaita Vedanta The nature of God in Western theology John Cage Jiddu Krishnamurti Immanuel Kant Cultural relativism Theology Epistemology Altruism Paul Tillich History of philosophy Marxism Meditation History of Western philosophy Dialectic Arthur Schopenhauer Supernatural Consciousness A Course In Miracles Chinese philosophy Swami Vivekananda Syed Muhammad Naquib al-Attas Philosophical skepticism Philosophy of history Wang Tao 6th century BC Sant Mat Yin and yang

what is cultural dualism cultural dualism is both a term that describes some characteristics of canadian society and in many people's view an ideology according to which the social and political systems of canada should be organized it is based on the historical fact that canada was colonized by both the french and the english and that both groups are therefore the founding peoples of canada this fact is used to justify the privileges accorded these groups in comparison to those accorded other ethnic groups and to justify the equality of the groups although the notion of cultural dualism has been translated into legislation and into policies of schooling religion language and the institutional rights of provinces its origins are difficult to determine some legislation can be interpreted as a defence of cultural dualism for example the quebec act legally recognized the catholic religion the seigneurial system and french civil law in qu bec the act of union proclaimed in recognized that the colonizing groups coexisted and the constitution act formalized some of the principles of cultural dualism first it determined the powers of the federal state and of the provinces thus recognizing some of the specificities of qu bec where french canadians formed the majority second legislation in regard to civil law was confirmed third in education a provincial domain a clause allowed for public funds to subsidize confessional schools and protected religious minorities in qu bec ironically this clause was demanded by qu bec english protestants who feared they would be outnumbered and overpowered by french catholics in qu bec french catholics in the rest of canada later attempted with little success to use the same clause to defend themselves against similar fears about the english canadians under qu bec language legislation bill and bill children of some groups particularly immigrants have been obliged to attend french schools but the legislation has not altered the denominational structure of education in montr al or the public funding of private religious or ethnic schools in qu bec it has often been said that canada was created as a state by mercantile capitalists and railway owners who needed a central administration from which to settle and exploit the country others especially many french canadians believed that confederation was a step towards a new state one that was independent of england it was understood that the founding groups were to coexist but the rights and privileges of catholic french canadians outside qu bec were either not specified or were denied or ignored see new brunswick school question ontario schools question manitoba schools question catholic schools often french were not subsidized by public funds french was forbidden in the public schools as were all languages other than english and a general assimilation into the anglo saxon british or anglo canadian world was seen as the only future for both french canadians and immigrants in the s the royal commission on bilingualism and biculturalism brought to light some of the difficulties encountered by french speakers and other groups in canada in the official languages act see also official languages act made canada at least symbolically an officially bilingual country and measures were taken to allow for service in french in the federal administration in the government adopted the policy of multiculturalism in a bilingual framework finally the constitution act affirmed some of the principles of cultural dualism the canadian charter of rights and freedoms stresses the right to equality and forbids discrimination french and english are described as the official languages of canada with equality in status in all parliamentary institutions and in the government of canada the charter also protects the rights of french and english minorities to be educated in their own languages allows for minority schools to be funded by public funds and confirms that it does not modify any rights or privileges guaranteed by or under the constitution of canada in respect of denominational separate or dissentient schools french and english are also official languages in new brunswick the only officially bilingual province there have been various interpretations of how the ideology of cultural dualism should actually manifest itself it has been argued that french and english should be equally represented by bilingual public servants at all levels of the federal system or that every federal government unit should have components one french one english and that there should be equality of opportunity at all levels of society eg political economic educational and social many french canadians believe that cultural dualism recognizes their specificity and their rights while others believe that it has never been applied in practice and that canada originally a british colony is now a us colony part of the french canadian population has also been in favour of a unilingual qu bec as a refuge for francophones and some believe that qu bec should secede from confederation but cultural dualism has been opposed most vociferously by english speaking groups many british colonialists wanted canada to be primarily an english speaking anglo saxon dependency of britain today several groups particularly but not exclusively in the west consider that canada should be unilingually english and that canadian american relations should be fostered because of a common general culture and because of the economic power of the us other groups have very much resented the ideology of cultural dualism believing that it excludes them from canadian life the native people stress that they were the first inhabitants of canada and that the french and english have eliminated them from the political and social life of the country ethnic groups who have immigrated during the last centuries believe that cultural dualism effectively excludes them as well from social and political life on the other hand many french canadians do not support the policy of multiculturalism because they consider that it does not recognize their special status the meech lake accord see meech lake accord document if accepted by the provincial legislative assemblies and the house of commons may be considered as a further step toward cultural dualism

do you like this quote they say the worst cynics are frustrated idealist i got it from a book i just finished reading its called the kill clause by gregg hurwitz great book if you like action thriller's anyway that quote really stroke a cord with me i like it a lot what do you think of it i wanted to check out why that might be a quote used in that particular book so i looked the book up and i assume this was a quote believed by the vigilantes in the book i agree with the quote the justice system itself is not idealistic the belief of just punishment applied in a fair and balanced manner does not always occur as we see everyday in life if the justice system knows there is a strong possibility as in the case with tim rackley's daughter that the person is guilty how can a technicality set the person free an idealistic person who views the justice system favorably could defiantly become cynical under these circumstances that's when i make a collation between the words idealism and conformity in this complex world with complex minds to think that conformity and an idealistic view will placate things is defiantly a downfall many variants in the world impede idealistic thinking being an idealistic person in a broad sense will defiantly make you frustrated which breed s negativity this is quite obvious in many aspects in life and is felt by many in law enforcement many become alcoholics when their idealistic views are shattered those in law enforcement battle with wanting to uphold the law of the land the courts will prevail but they see that many crimes and conditions of individual people allow for an unjust outcome an outcome that doesn't mirror their idealistic thinking such as all criminals will go to jail only in a idealistic world will that happen or any judge can see a criminals guilt again only in an idealistic world this book sounds really interesting i think i will check it out i love suspenseful action crime thrillers i just read a wonderful book before and after by rosellen brown it's quite similar it's from the perspective of the family members involved they seem to live an idealistic life and that's shattered when they must battle with wanting to protect their son who is accused of murdering his girlfriend or turning him over to the justice system  Social justice Capital punishment Due process Goodness and value theory Supreme Court of the United States Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Murder Slander and libel Predestination A Course In Miracles Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Objectivist philosophy Appeal Civil rights Liberalism Plame affair Scientology beliefs and practices Coercion Originalism First Amendment to the United States Constitution Socrates Jury trial Unlawful combatant Fathers' rights Contract Crime International Criminal Court Capital punishment in the United States Property (ownership right) Patriotism Abortion debate Rape Alignment (role-playing games) Sin Epistemology Intellectual property Crime fiction Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Guilt Hugo Black Estoppel Domestic violence Ethics Ten Commandments EastEnders Freedom of speech Capitalism Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution Lawrence v.

i think my fianc is dumb when i met him he was years old living at his dad's house and had just lost a job working as a night auditor at a hotel we dated for a while then i found out he had an year old son from ex wife of years which i was attracted to because i wanted to have kids someday and he seemed like a good father and not scared of marriage he was a nice people person always helping out and doing romantic things for me he even started saving up for my engagement ring after only months of us dating then surprised me with it about a year later when we met i was working as a cocktail waitress at bars and drinking couple times a week and he didn t like it and almost dumped me so i quit drinking to prove i wasn t an alcoholic which i wasn t and even quit the job so he wouldn t get jealous and it was just a fun job for me to make extra cash with anyway i didn t care about it i m he s and we ve been living in my house for about a year now we re expecting a baby boy next month and i m not working i quit my job as a poker dealer because they had no business so it wasn t worth my time and he just started a job a month ago as a graveyard cook at a restaurant before that he took his first semester of college and i pretty much did his work for him and tried to explain it to him i m not saying i m a genius but i ve been to college tech school and was always head of my class he was in the coast guard when he was my age married and taking care of his ex and their son working jobs he was also in a band doing small bar gigs when i met him this all sounded good to me but now i m questioning our relationship i ll leave out the other problems we have but my main concern is with money we both want to start a business and i will but i don t think he has what it takes today he told me he wants to quit his job because it s too much with the hour shifts and he has no time to spend with his son and i and i would be fine with that but i know he s not going to help me out as much as i need him to get this business started so we don t have to worry about money and finding crap jobs he doesn t seem to think long term about things he gets frustrated and he ll enthusiastically help out anyone who asks him which uses up most of his time but when i ask him for help i get an attitude it gets done half assed or not at all he doesn t have common sense sometimes and i ll end up having to do what i asked him to do anyway when i was on my own i had plenty of money for my needs enough space in my house where it wasn t hard to maintain and it was much easier overall this guy doesn t pick up after himself and thinks if he cleans the house once a month i ll be satisfied i do almost all housework he has tons of clothes and the laundry is ridiculous he s a packrat and i need an organized clean home to run my business out of i ve always been a generous person and i split everything with him and go out of my way to do things for him last week he told me his paychecks were going to start going into my bank account then today he grabs all the money and says he s holding onto it we broke up once before because i let his friend stay with us which i thought was for overnight and turned into a month i finally kicked him out because it was causing problems in our relationship and i m not supporting an alcoholic grown man years older than me fianc was complaining about how much money he spent on me when i never asked him to do it and i spent just as much if not more on him fianc was offended i asked his friend to leave and one night when i got home from my poker job both of their stuff was gone and a couple of my things i actually came home early that night and caught him moving the rest out and he claimed it was an accident and returned my stuff two months later he begged for me back and i gave him a chance i m sure it s better living with me than his parents i do love this guy and don t want my baby to grow up without a father but he s really holding me back and i can t take his little toddler temper tantrums when he s asked to do something i will have enough of that with my new baby and i need some support by my side not another kid i have to look after i m just writing my thoughts here and wondering if it would be better for me to raise this child alone and work on my business since i doubt he ll be of much help i d never deprive him of seeing his son and hope we could be friends or at least civil with each other i might add that i don t have a family myself except for my grandmother but she will be gone any day now my mother is a psychotic bitch seriously she s even going to mental health court and was on drugs over years i m not really allowed to see my younger siblings and they live far never met my dad and don t talk to any other relatives will the love of my child be enough to keep me strong to make my dreams come true and our lives better without any other support or help neither one of you sounds very smart or mature getting pregnant when you're not married both of you quitting jobs do you know how many 's of dollars it costs for a normal day hospital stay to have a baby close to do you have health insurance to cover that how does he pay child support for his son when he's out of work he's going to have to work jobs to support kids and you while you can't work due to the pregnancy  Shaggy dog

to be virgin or not is it still morally ethically and socially acceptable to be a virgin nowadays morally this is based on religion and since most religions say only have sex when married then yes it is morally acceptable even commanded to be a virgin unless maried ethically it's very possible that there is an ethical question here but it won't be received well by many people if you believe that your virginity is the property or right of your future spouse then there is an ethical responsibility to remain a virgin if you believe that your virginity is your own property then this is a non issue socially based upon one response above and on the movie alluded to it is not socially acceptable to be a virgin after a certain age herein referenced to be but not further defined in fact that the discussion is brought about by so many it would seem that normal sexual behavior includes both virginity and non virginity and that society values normal sexual behavior therefor it is socially acceptable to be either  Ethics Sexual abstinence Feminism Marriage Same-sex marriage Religion and sexuality Abortion debate Sexual orientation Human sexual behavior Homosexuality and Christianity Roman Catholic Church Goodness and value theory Feminist movement Virgin Coercion Sex education Reality Human sexuality David Hume Pedophilia Rape Religion and sexual orientation Moral relativism Sociology Polyamory Science Religion Atheism Business ethics Human Mary, the mother of Jesus Human rights Child sexuality Zoophilia Altruism Objectivist philosophy Sexual revolution Game theory Value system Bernard Williams Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Laura Schlessinger Gender role Meme Liberalism Anal sex Economic inequality The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Social justice Child sexual abuse Ten Commandments Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Polygamy Childlove movement Nicomachean Ethics Paul of Tarsus Transsexuality Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith Chastity Sexual intercourse Microeconomics Rick Santorum Criticism of Islam Infantilism Video game controversy Divorce Ethical consumerism Same-sex marriage in Canada Theory of conduct Sexual abuse Choice and sexual orientation Externality Economics Scientology beliefs and practices The Virgin Suicides Green economics Social psychology Cult Democracy Conservatism Pornography Philosophy of business Sigmund Freud Patriotism Homosexuality Consensual crime Postmodernism Free will Secularization Capital accumulation Peter Singer Ideology Sex Causality Noahide Laws Labor theory of value Bioethics

why do i make myself isolated everytime my friends ask me to do something or go somewhere i just don't i hate group projects at school and the few friends i have annoy me because they say i never go over their house or spend time with them i avoid them alot in school and just don't want to be bothered with them everytime my family and i move i say i'll be more outgoing but it never happens everyday i eat lunch alone even when i see people i know why am i like this all i do for fun is watch movies listen to music and go on the computer at home why do i find social situations to be bothersome and pointless how do i change this wow i thought i was the only one who felt this way at first i thought that maybe i was just shy and had low self esteem but now as i grow older i think that this is not necessarily the case it has become apart of my personlity some days i can be energetic a little social but people in general to me are just annoying their energy just drags me down of course i may have those family members and two or three friends that i really enjoy spending time with but sometimes when i see them on campus or somewhere i still don't feel like being bothered with them even though i know they didn't do anything wrong sometimes i don't have the energy to smile to interact to start and partake in conversation and it really makes me sad to feel like this but i just like spending time with myself enjoying my nice collection of music watching my favorite tv programs and surfing the web it gives me time to emerse myself in my own thoughts get in touch with my feelings and enjoy myself without any distractions i have been diagnosed with bi polar depression so this is probadly why i act this way do you feel depressed  Shaggy dog story Hikikomori The Catcher in the Rye Pitaten Milton H.

poll uk 'silver surfers' only please do you remember the 's and the country as it was do you think immigration has enhanced our country as a nation mustaffa laff did i say degraded or did you just degrade yourself with a foolish answer old know all i think you aren't actually that old really and you know feck all about anything really hello as a 'silver surfer' of i do remember growing up in the s and have some idea of the country as it was to answer your question first immigration has not enhanced our country as a nation since too many people have come here with no jobs no home and no money the majority have expected to be housed by local authorities given money and not find work unless they have to years on and immigration has changed little after the war had ended a blanket ban on all immigration should have been made if immigrants wanted to come here they should have had the means to have somewhere to live a job to go to and money in the bank with which to live off had selective immigration been in place then we would not have the situations we face now years on and instead of million people out of work we would have had full employment for our own countryfolk in the past we had a police force not a dumbed down police service respect for law and order diminishes with each generation criminals were sent to jail for longer for their crimes and corporal and capital punishment were the order of the day bring both back i say pupils had respect for teachers which many now no longer have pupils were given many 'rights' but without accepting 'responsibility' for these 'rights' meal times were the time for families to spend some quality time together there were only television stations and radio stations to watch or listen to and they were not on all day there are no manners being taught these days there is no concern for neighbours anymore and how they are if they were ill shops were not open hours a day like they are now pubs were open for limited numbers of hours every day now that we have hour drinking you can go to any town centre and see the results of it barked up on every street corner the age of consent was and this should be brought back as the 'norm' it used to be a better place in the s than it is in in a nation where foreigners now outweigh the indiginous population like where i used to live in edmonton london and the fact that most of them don't want to or can't be bothered to speak english made me want to move instead of getting better as country we're a nation of i me mine and everyone looking out for their own ends crime is on the increase because we have dreadful legislation with which to punish criminals with there is less respect now than there ever was kids roaming streets at night the untouchables weren't heard of in my day nowaday parental responsibility has gone to the wall with many parents having no clue as to where their dreadful offspring are or what they're doing i could go and on but will end here on a personal level i would prefer to live back in the s if i could it was the only time i felt happy all the very best alan l  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame

what has more impact on your life you social views or your political views and why political views are a sub set of social views socialization is the process by which we are transformed from babies who can only say go go ga ga to functioning members of society therefore social views covers everything from the religion or lack thereof in which we were raised our family values our ethnic heritage our political tendencies our national identity our friendships and views on relationships our opinions on popular culture and our conformity or non conformity to norms and mores including but not limited to lifestyle education career fashion politics are just one part of the larger societal culture so in that way i suppose i would say our social views impact one's life more because they govern not only our thoughts on politics but our behavior in our lives for instance politically you may be against abortion but that doesn't necessarily mean that in a social setting you shun your friend who happened to get an abortion your political view on gun control may be that no one should have a gun but you still talk to your uncle earl who lives out in the country and hunts ducks with his shotgun your political identity and your social reality are sometimes different it's easy to speak and believe in political ideals but in our everyday lives we rarely live up to them perhaps this is because in politics many things are starkly black or white but culturally there are various shades of gray to any ideal  Social psychology Gender role Sexual abstinence Culture Liberalism Abortion debate Reality Political spectrum Sociology Ideology Abortion Nationalism Nihilism Human nature Labor theory of value Human Evangelicalism Power (sociology) Human sexual behavior Homosexuality Morality Anthroposophy Value system Narcissism Pedophilia Religion and sexuality Karl Marx Autism rights movement Friedrich Nietzsche Law of value Human rights Indigenous peoples Separation of church and state Infantilism Zoophilia Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Ethics Meaning of life Capitalism Marriage State Black (people) Slavoj __i__ek Goodness and value theory Norm (sociology) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Heteronormativity Cross-dressing Microeconomics Human sexuality Sigmund Freud Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Free market Franz Boas Torah im Derech Eretz Rudolf Steiner Voter turnout American Conservatism Noam Chomsky Feminism Social justice Modernism Cultural relativism Culture of the United States Internet troll Generation X Social movement Class in the contemporary United States Education Afrophobia Nicomachean Ethics Feminist movement Dissociative identity disorder Communitarianism Political economy Evil Max Weber Homophobia Generation Y Philosophy of language Economics Social Culture of Lithuania Multiculturalism Trade union White nationalism

does aknowleging racism magnify the idea that everyone should be looked at differently i think that when we have racism awareness it just angers minorities and causes reverse racism everyone wants a scapegoat to blame their everyday inconveniences on hell i do i have personally felt the wrath of reverse racism because of people who are mad at light skinned people for being in a culturally benefited standpoint i think that people are people period who agrees i think that you bring up a great and valid point as long as we're looking for racism we're going to find it thus encouraging others to commit acts of racism if there was no plaplicity geared toward racism i think it would fade away because people would eventually lose sight of the concept everything that makes up our culture is there because we have made it the forefront i think racism exists because people need reason to hate someone for instance as a no talent at basketball white boy i might be playing a basketball game with several african americans if i am beaten horribly instead of rationalizing hey maybe they've worked hard to get where they are maybe they've been playing since they were which would justify their talents but instead because i think of us as being equal i have to come up with a reason for them being better other then their personal work and achievement therefore i might rationalize that hey they're better because they are black so i guess it's hard to say whether it's because of society or because of our own drive to try and keep things equal that when someone is better at something we are left with only the physical aspects race gender body type to rationale why they are better what do you guys think  Racism Affirmative action Black (people) Patriotism American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Religion Infantilism Sexual orientation Social justice Homophobia Racial segregation Rastafari movement Sociobiology Theory of conduct A Course In Miracles Liberalism Goodness and value theory Nationalism Civil rights Human Afrocentrism Gender Multiculturalism Evil Race and intelligence Philosophy of science Modernism Homosexuality Nadir of American race relations Ethnic issues in Japan Scientific racism Reparations for slavery Franz Boas Gender-neutral language Democracy Postmodernism Racism in the United States White nationalism Abortion debate Universal pragmatics Autism Objectivist philosophy Nazism New anti-Semitism Anti-Semitism Race Falsifiability Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Hate speech Black nationalism Speciesism Equal Protection Clause Mahatma Gandhi White (people) Nigger Aesthetic Realism History of science Carl Jung Rape Peter Singer Gender role Sociocultural evolution Friedrich Schleiermacher Transactional analysis God Blacks and Mormonism Utilitarianism Simone Weil Moral objectivism Pedophilia Supernatural Meme Ghost Value system Race of Jesus Anti-Zionism Social psychology Transsexuality Freemasonry Deconstruction The nature of God in Western theology Criticism of libertarianism Scientific method Islam as a political movement The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Property (ownership right) Political philosophy Age of Enlightenment Causality Discrimination Homosexuality and Christianity Pacifism

identify two patterns of social stratification i e class race caste gender in terms of their bases their effects on society and the possibilities for moving out of the social place to a higher status provide two effects on society and two possibilities or lack of possibilities for moving to a higher social status social stratification is the ranking of people in a vertical arrangement hierarchy that differentiates them as superior or inferior biological traits to not become relevant in patterns of social superiority and inferiority until they are socially recognized and given importance by being incorporated into the beliefs attitudes and values of the people in the society social stratification means that inequality has been institutionalized in what ways are societies stratified social class implies having or not having the following individual rights privileges power rights over others authority life style choices self determination status wealth access to services comfort leisure etc comer racial and ethnic stratification refers systems of inequality in which some fixed groups membership such as race religion or national origin is a major criterion for ranking social positions and their differential rewards race is socially defined on the basis of a presumed common genetic heritage resulting in distinguishing physical characteristics ethnicity refers to the condition of being culturally rather than physically distinctive ethnic peoples are bound together by virtue of common ancestry and a common cultural background without slavery there is no cotton without cotton there is no modern industry karl marx the slave labor force grew from in to million in to in steinberg whereas only pounds of cotton were exported in by the figure had grown to billion pounds steinberg by cotton constituted percent of american exports nearly all went to britain cotton was the most important stimulus to growth in both countries thistlewaite the unites states was built up on an economy of slavery that in itself was no crime many societies and countries have been based on slavery the crime of the united states is that it is the first and only country which having freed its slaves legally by proclamation by law and in the courts then continued to enslave them and denied them equal rights on the basis of their color boggs a society which had consistently underinvested in black students ought to now adopt race based policies aimed at helping young blacks overcome the deficits yielded by segregation the legacy of decades of systematic deprivation could be overcome only by color conscious policies direct at the victims of that deprivation howard opponents of affirmative action have sought to seize the moral high ground arguing that such policies betray the central ethical claim which drove the civil rights movement in its long struggle against segregation people ought to be accorded equal treatment without regard to race gender or other extraneous characteristics the main burden of change must lie with programs that can develop a degree of genuine equality that will make affirmative action unnecessary howard gender is the patterning of difference and domination through distinctions between women and men gender roles are social constructions they contain self perceptions and psychological traits as well as family occupational and political roles assigned to each sex patriarchy is the term for forms of social organization in which men are dominant over women order perspective on stratification society must provide suitable rewards money prestige and power to induce individuals to fill positions such as those that involve decision making medicine religion teaching and the military a differential reward system guarantees that the important societal functions are fulfilled thereby ensuring the maintenance of society differential ranks actually serve to unify society through a division of labor and through the socialization of people to accept their positions in the system is inequality primarily integrative or divisive conflict perspective on stratification conflict perspective assumes that stratification reflects the distribution of power in society and is therefore a major source of discord and coercion the unequal distribution of rewards reflects the interests of the powerful and not the basic survival needs of society stratification is unjust divisive and a source of social instability or change p institutional discrimination is when the customary way of doing things prevailing attitudes and expectations and accepted structural arrangements work to the disadvantage of the poor

is this a weird thing smart folks help is it wrong to contemplate life a lot the world you live in soceity this is something i think about quite a bit just how people are and what we are what's wrong with us why can't it be like this appreciate that love that person you said you did integrity virtue all these things you know what saying i try not to let this consume my every being and every thought but i never really stop thinking about it ever its always in the back of my mind tucked away just that constant thought of life is that weird not weird at all i find that i become most pre occupied with those very things when i'm kind of in a transition in my life sometimes it's triggered by finding out that someone close to me is seriously ill or someone dies sometimes there are triggers like a world crisis for instance i also go through that obsessing when i'm at a crossroads in my life like when my life is going to change for instance starting a new school finishing school a new job moving i think we need to meditate and think about life and the world and our spirit as well as our future our past i think it's like doing a personal inventory and it can be extremely cathartic if you feel lonely with your thoughts and could use a sounding board by all means seek someone to share some of your thoughts with on the other hand if you feel as though this is an 'obsession' that you are working through on your own don't even worry about it i think it's very good that you are thinking about your values your virtue and integrity the love you feel or don't feel evaluating yourself and how you fit in the world around you is an important part of maturing and 'evolving' and is on going for all of your life the fact that you feel that you are a little consumed by it at this time in your life could be an indication that you are about to enter a different phase of your life and trying to determine just where you stand on a lot of important issues you are obviously seeking wisdom go to a library and see what you can find there that may help you answer some of the things that have been niggling at you you'll be just fine i wish more people would take the time to think as you are instead of just spinning their wheels and running their mouths good luck on this intense life journey  Extreme Programming Socrates Nicomachean Ethics Theory of conduct Social rule Friedrich Schleiermacher Goodness and value theory Philosophy of language 2000 Australian Grand Prix The nature of God in Western theology Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Past teachings of Prem Rawat Meditation Love Traumatic incident reduction Friends of the Western Buddhist Order Time Out of Mind Autism Philosophy Pitaten Shaggy dog story Philo Jon Secada Arthur Schopenhauer Stoicism David Hume Predestination Epistemology Modernism Friends Ken Wilber Rudolf Hermann Lotze Summa Theologiae Scenes from a Memory Kodocha The Apprentice 2 Narcissism One Tree Hill (TV series) K' Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity A Course In Miracles Obsessive-compulsive disorder About a Boy W.I.T.C.H.

what determines someone to become left or right handed genetics nature nuture or a combination of i am left handed so is my brother but my sister is right handed it's interesting to know that in the past being left handed was considered evil the devil always approaches from the left side children had their left hand tied up to discourage use of it also children from babyhood were often smacked on the left hand to discourage its use so there must be some predisposed genetic tendency linked to the brain those who are left handed are using the right side of the brain and idf this is damaged are said to be able to train themselves to use the other hand  Biology and sexual orientation Stroke Human nature Left-handed Language acquisition Cephalic disorder Drug addiction Cancer Rock, Paper, Scissors Free will Medicine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Addiction The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Philip J.

marriage is being reshaped where is it heading judging by the number of divorces marriage is no longer an unbreakable covenant where is the marriage institution heading today's children are learning a behavior of marriage break up instead of unbreakable marriage this acquired knowledge will take them to marriage and divorce sorry it's long but i promise it's worth the read i live in a family where my parents are divorced sets of aunts uncles have divorced a few times and just this past weekend my dad's parents just got remarried this is their rd marriage together and they each have been married to someone else once the idea of marriage isn't at all what it used to be marriage as you stated used to be an unbreakable covenant so what's changed i think it's the worlds definition of love and loyalty back in the day when you got married you were stuck yeah divorce was around but society demanded that you stay loyal to your spouse for better and for worse but now that idea of loyalty does not exist the idea now is it's all about me with the me mentality when we find ourselves in a situation that we don't like instead of trying to fix the problem we just avoid it and run away from it after all if i'm not happy with someone or something it's not my job to fix it the next part is the current view or idea of love love is a word that has become to commonly used love was once a word to describe a pure feeling that was unbreakable and represented the strongest of relationships it still is but people claim love when they haven't reached that point when someone cares greatly for someone are attractived to them and enjoys them alot they automatically think it's love but eventually your feelings of caring the persons attractiveness and the enjoyment might fade so what's left if there's no love then there's nothing holding it together love is the glue of a relationship without enough of it everything else with fall apart where is it heading it's hard to say i am fearful that eventually the idea of marriage will be unsacred and no longer cherished at all but honestly it's up to us to bring those ideas of a pure and honest marriage back if the institute of marriage is not restored soon then it will just continue to crumple to nothingness everything in this world now revolves around one's personal desires of the flesh therefore everyone strives for something that will fullfill a certain desire as animals it's our nature to become selfish and fall into those desires but as humans it's in our nature to change and to become better so let's become better i've really enjoyed your question it was very thought provoking enjoy your day glen  Divorce Marriage Polyamory Sexual orientation EastEnders Theory of conduct Alignment (role-playing games) Fathers' rights Goodness and value theory Love Infantilism One Tree Hill (TV series) Transsexuality Objectivist philosophy Human sexual behavior The Amber Spyglass Miss Saigon Meaning of life Sant Thakar Singh Happiness Friends Same-sex marriage Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses T'Pol Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Sexual abstinence Polygamy Christian view of marriage Homophobia Transactional analysis Knots Landing Pedophilia Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity The O.C.

question on ethnicity ok my grandparents were born and raised in cuba they came to the us pre castro and had kids born in new york my mom and my aunt then they went back to cuba where my mom and aunt were raised and then again came to the us right before castro took over my father is from nc of english and cherokee indian his grandmother was cherokeee decent so that make me white and cuban right or what am i also my husband is mexican born there and came to the states when he was we have kids a yr old son and a yr old daughter but he says they are not cuban since they are mostly mexican my kids are american by nationality but what would be their ethnicity also i am fluent in spanish i speak it write it and read it and i also love my novelas i would lean toward hispanic mostly by marriage you live in a hispanic household which is really the only difference betwween you ethnically and many whites remember white is a state of mind not a blood line so many wide ranging groups are wrapped up in the various ethnicities that few have any real meaning whites as the term is generally accepted are europeans northern southern eastern and western those of arabic descent indian hispanic with predominently european ancestry asian with predomiently european ancestry and northern african with predomently european ancestry the same ancestry that is cuban is very close to many mediteranian ethnicities southern italian and french greek and northern african minus moorish influences not many moors made it to cuba in mexico and south america they were the bulk of the spanards basically if you'd married a white guy you'd fallen into the white ethnecity unless you were a dark cuban if you'd married a native you'd been considered native most cubans are either very eurpean or very african in ancestry they could either walk around in spain or africa depending on which and appear to be local if dressed appropriately mexican is like saying american there are so many potential ancestry groups that it's meaningless as an ethnicity most mexicans are predomiently native with some european or african stock there have been waves of european imigration to mexico and americans crossing the border have produced many mexicans that look very northern european there are many mexicans also who do not have a drop of european blood in them even those of native stock those from mayan ancestors are very distinct from those of apache and navajo blood lines so when you say mexican you've only said nationality not ethnicity the other factor is that you speak spanish fluently this tends to be a hispanic trait though which dialect s cuban spanish or the tex mex spoken in northern mexico or the central american dilect or spanish like it's spoken in spain or a south american dialect these dialects have diverged to the point where they could almost be separate languages though spanish tv is beginning to draw the dialects together over recent years if your really curious you should research your geneology and see where your various ancestors came from many cubans came from other latin american nations when revolts overthrew the rule class which was generally of spanish descent and drove most of those with strong spanish descent to places like cuba and puerto rico your ancestors might be recent arrivals from another nation also possibly only a generation or two in cuba before coming to america many americans wound up in cuba over the years and so you may have more european heritage than you suspect  Spanish language African American Latin American music Mexico Afro-Latin American Black (people) Race (U.S. Census) New Mexico Africa Spain German language Cherokee Spanish in the United States Mulatto Native Americans in the United States Latin America Chinese language Cuba Puerto Rico Creole Family Peru Palestinian United States Southern United States Spanish-American War Family name Ethnic groups of the Philippines New York-New Jersey English Nationalism Demographics of the Philippines South America Arabic language French people Non-native pronunciations of English Music of Puerto Rico Spanish dialects and varieties Music of Mexico Arab Afrikaans Race Hern__n Cort__s Jew Multiracial Filipino people Coloured Standard Mandarin Language family Latin alphabet European colonization of Arizona North America South Africa Native American music Telenovela Music of Spain Christopher Columbus Fidel Castro Portuguese language Europe Dominican Republic Mexican Spanish Romance languages Miami, Florida Americas Taiwanese (linguistics) Demographics of the United States Music history of the United States Florida Creole language African American Vernacular English Semitic Yucat__n John J.

is there less war now than in the past in other words as time goes on does the incidence of war lessen there has never been a time in history as peaceful as now most likely hard to say since large chunks of human history was before recorded history the reduction in the amount of war has little to do with time a little to do with a tired populace mostly it has to do with the increased consequences of war because of technology there are cycles of war the most recent brought about gentleman's war in europe the preceeding years had so badly ravaged europe that the entire continent was not only on the verge but at times thrown into utter chaos cities were sacked killing all or nearly all who dwelled within entire populations decimated by the starvation brought on by war after a point the populations of europe became war weary just as ww ii and ww i has left european nations terrified of another war the level of destruction and the loss of a large chunk of a whole generation has left them exhausted as a people so for a time these peoples become peace loving nations having had their fill of war for a time eventually the past is forgotten and the cycle cranks up again technology has interupted this cycle the costs of war are too high for any nation now if nukes or biological weapons are used the us and ussr if not for nukes would have had a shooting war that lasted maybe a decade instead it lasted for decades with both nations fighting by proxy using third world nations as the battleground the primary reason was a shooting war would lead to the use of nukes and that would end the world for all today nukes are proliferating and the more countries that have them the more likely war will result unlike the us ussr cold war there are nations today seeking nukes that believe they can use them up until recently technology conventional and nuclear has served as a deterrent to war wars have happened in the third world not in developed nations the costs would be too high for developed nations to go to war even if no wmds were used conventional war with modern weapons means huge casualty counts tactics have not kept up with advancements in technology nor has defensive weapons so both civillian and military dead would be massive think about it if we were to go to war the factories would be rather close to where you live oil pipe lines technology centers research centers military bases important highways waterways bridges how many of us don't leave near one weapons don't always fall where they are supposed to a near miss could be your neighborhood or the nieghborhood of friends and relatives when conventional weapons can easily take out a square block and vaporize it think about millions of block busters hitting the nation during the course of the war ground troops with the armor support air support and so on this happening in both nations it makes a pretty good deterrent against going to war that is what war between developed nations will be like that is why there hasn't been one since ww ii technology has come a long way since then and ww ii was such a bloody war that it's scared two generations out of war so far  Nuclear weapon Cold War Nuclear warfare Terran (StarCraft) World War II Economy of Africa Nuclear power Total war Nuclear weapons and the United States Mutual assured destruction Military history of the Soviet Union Kosovo War Gulf War Rise of Nations Peace movement Superpower Operation Barbarossa Iran-Iraq War Iran and weapons of mass destruction Soviet Union Vietnam War Famine 2003 Invasion of Iraq Weapon History of nuclear weapons Bloody Valentine War Polish September Campaign Military history Combine (Half-Life 2) Ozone depletion Second Bloody Valentine War Marshall Plan Iraq disarmament crisis British Army Winter War RAF Bomber Command War Franco-Prussian War Battle of the Bulge Post-invasion Iraq, 2003___2005 Blood (computer game) Ozone hole Royal Air Force Iraq Survey Group Armoured warfare John Titor Infantry Battle of Stalingrad Nuclear proliferation Future energy development Military history of Japan Zerg Terminal ballistics Early modern warfare United States Army Eastern Front (World War II) Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Yom Kippur War Asymmetric warfare Criticisms of the War on Terrorism Military history of the United States World War I Tank classification Counter-Strike Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Bombing of Dresden in World War II Red Army Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact Napoleonic Wars Second Sino-Japanese War Energy development Battle of Kursk Siege Donald Rumsfeld Global warming Military history of the Roman Empire Protoss Anti-ballistic missile Guilty Gear William Perry War of the Pacific Modern warfare Solar cell Burma Campaign T-72 U.S. invasion of Afghanistan Ground Control II: Operation Exodus

is this a family i know this couple their gonna have a baby in december their not married and only have been dating for about years or so i asked them if their gonna get married and they said they talk about it casually which probably means no now my question is this a family or a temporary convince now don't get me wrong in no way am i trying to come off judgmental or be the moral coach here but is this not a good question this is folks is this not the age of convinve and the easy way out is it not modern culture i mean look around so it makes wonder is about family or a tempoary convince once again i am not trying to judge just curious don't get me wrong i believe very much in marriage but a family is certainly not built on simply that being a family to me isn't about a marital bond or what's on paper it's about the love and respect that you accord each other that you can communicate and that you are willing to be there for someone else a marriage is nice to have and stops the neighbors from chattering but there are married couples that don't communicate or show each other respect that are less of a family than what your friends are going to potentially be as to whether it's temporary that is up to your friends again even full marriages can be temporary best not to worry about it and don't change how you feel about them because of this  Human sexual behavior Polyamory Theory of conduct Marriage Humphrey Bogart Knots Landing Goodness and value theory Polygamy Homosexuality and Judaism AFI 100 Years series Same-sex marriage Friends Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tina Turner Birth control Shaggy dog story True Crime: Streets of LA Jennifer Lopez One Tree Hill (TV series) Sexual orientation Days of our Lives Jean Grey Same-sex marriage in Canada Theodicy Social rule Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Milton H.

why is it that people in more expensive houses don't allow interviews i work for a research company which involves working in various assigned areas i knock on doors an ask people if if can do a survey in areas where there are expensive houses very few will say yes but in houses of lower income families many more people are happy to give you their time to do a survery whether or not they have screaming children or are about to go to work or have just come home from work people in expensive houses don't want to take the time to answer surveys because they would rather spend their time doing something else that they think is more important the rich and powerful value privacy more often the opinions of the people in expensive houses are probably already better heard whereas lower income families want to do surveys because they their opinions are likelier to have been less acknowledged and therefore they want to do the surveys  Divorce Statistical survey Economic inequality Social rule Opinion poll George W.

for you what does racism mean does it affect your daily life or are you just trying to sit on the politically correct band wagon of society wow a real question i hope you won't be sorry that i saw it yes racism does effect me every minute of my life i am shocked when people imply that they don't feel racism exist it's still here mostly especially in the us it is so 'undercover' that if you are not paying attention you might miss it but don't be fooled there will always be an 'underclass' i know that's not a good word but it is the only one i can use to discribe what i see whether they are black or poor or other races or homosexuals or prisoners convicts or whatever discrimination racism they both speak to the same problem worst yet is when we know what is being said or done is wrong but we do nothing like it doesn't effect us the next time it just might it was the law order episode about a teen who drinks herself to death at a party hosted by other teans all the kids did everybody else at the part including the host was clean up the house they were in tresspassing and lay the girl on the bed no one tried to call or even to call the girl's family or to take her home nothing my daughters thought that since no one 'forced' the girl to drink that no one should be held responsible or accountable my response was 'inaction is an action' and if we are not held responsible for our inaction especially when it 'does harm' we may as well go back to the dark ages now some might think that might not be such a bad idea but it really is because as bad as we think it is now it would be worst if we didn't have the safeguards that are in place but are not being adhered to in many cases i think we stopped wanting to be 'our brother's keeper' we should care about each other and 'the whole planet of earth' as a people instead of allowing our differences in beliefs or languages to stop us from wanting to do what's right for all this quote continues to come to my mind because everyday i see that it is so very true and we need to all start paying attention to it 'all that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing ' i'm so guilty of the doing nothing when others are making jokes about groups of people i laugh i don't speak up and say 'no i can't participate in that' i thnk it's funny why not laugh because i wouldn't like it if something like that was being said about me because in most cases the thing being said isn't true or what's being done is wrong because it's not right and by doing nothing except laughing i am encouraging others to continue this wrong behavior it seems like a small thing but it's a place to start to be more socially conscience you we start and the rest will follow  Theory of conduct Social rule Evil Reparations for slavery Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Goodness and value theory Whose Line Is It Anyway?

sociology how would you use functionalism or conflict theory to assess the impact of the family on an year old girl with learning physical disabilities my friend is doing her hnc on this and is in a flap as she has not got a clue my forte is psychology so cannot really help any yahoo answerer know what this q means and how to tackle it thanks so much functionalism is the idea that each of us in society is directed to act by societies constraints durkheim said that society is organic and each of its systems interacts to ensure maximal function and societal health so there are forces of education law family religion class etc that act on each of us to make us comply with their wishes in the case of the year old girl these functions might include the medical establishments ideas on learning disability the education depatments take on it family expectations of support the acceptance of disbability the role expectations of disability and childhood as negotiated statuses basicaly the girl and her family will act in ways that fit into societies expectations conflict theory i am fairly confident is the structural theory of marx that society treats those with disability in certain ways to differentiate them form the working class who can contribute to capitalist profit there will be elements of gender in this as the child is probably attended by her mother the unpaid carer supporting the father to work and so feed the machine marx would probably say that the disabled are kept at subsistance levels as they can not contribute and assistance is only provided at the level that prevents conflict e g if they were not fed the family would revolt against the system this is conflict theory because the plight of the girl will never be alleviated only mollified until capital and labour come to conflict over it try and explore these areas the functions of society acting on the girl and her family and the conflict with capital that the learning disabled represent feminist viewpoint included  Sociology Gender role Social psychology Labor theory of value Unemployment Political economy Autism Liberalism Division of labour Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Labor-power Sociology of religion Sociocultural evolution Karl Marx Transsexuality Law of value Divorce __mile Durkheim Democracy Microeconomics Economic inequality Anarchism and capitalism Social class Indigenous peoples Capital accumulation Libertarian socialism Max Weber Fathers' rights Louis Althusser Education in the United States Narcissism Hikikomori Feudalism History of science Ethics Feminism Productive and unproductive labour Surplus value Education Asperger syndrome Social theory Surplus labour Class struggle Strategic management Medicine Object-oriented programming Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Labour economics Sexual orientation Historical materialism Contract Civil rights Social justice Psychology Religion Social Mode of production Capitalism Socialist economics Androgen insensitivity syndrome New Deal Anthropology Science Antonio Gramsci Michel Foucault War Mental illness Adult attention-deficit disorder History of intersex surgery Sigmund Freud Infantilism Tax Prices of production Clinical depression History of economic thought Coercion Nurse Objectivist philosophy Education in England Anarchism Gender Mental retardation Immanuel Kant Drug abuse Graphology Reliability engineering Obesity Surplus product Carl Jung Pedophilia

why does society say we have to be nice to children children are just people like anybody else so why should people be extra sweet to them first of all they are not people like anybody else they are children not small adults children although how a person turns out is dependent on multiple factors one of the most important things is developing sound ideals how much influence did the adults in your life have on your becoming who you are now children learn by example it is a battle a war between selfish immature desires and doing the right thing it is up to us adults to show children through example the benefits of making the right choices so the answer is so that they can have the best possible chance of turning out to be kind caring sensible loving happy adults have a great day  Objectivist philosophy Abortion debate Sant Thakar Singh Altruism Economic inequality Current teachings of Prem Rawat Goodness and value theory Social psychology Lie Transactional analysis John Howard Yoder Mental retardation Motivation Asperger syndrome Polyamory Sexual orientation Evil Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Narcissism Coercion Meaning of life Nicomachean Ethics GED Statutory rape Love Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Paternalism Education Social rule Moral Politics Birthday Hearing impairment Homeschooling Utilitarianism Human Consensus decision-making Kender Microeconomics Pitaten Philosophy of education Alignment (role-playing games) Childfree Cancer Grief Intelligence quotient Child Bayesian inference Prisoner's dilemma Human sexual behavior Happiness Bradley Nowell A.

debate in society are writers and artists more important than the business people and mechanics this is more of an 'open debate' question in a functioning society nation do you think the writers painters and poets the arty intellectuals who humor and entertain are more important compared to the down to earth mechanical business people mechanics and engineers who actually build a nation or is it the other way round please try to avoid the both are equally important answer my two cents early man could indulge in the singing and painting only when he was safe secure had a roof cave over his head and had a full stomach with time to spare after hunting farming in a hypothetical scenario society would collapse without engineers and business people on the other hand life would be stable just a bit dry without artists and poets to the engineers feel free to express your views source of question www politicalcompass org test thanks for the answers and opinions everybody keep more coming in artists are definitely needed and help greatly with business and mechanics could an engineer really get away with not designing an illustration for his machine how would he communicate it sure he could show it but drawing a complex sketch with numbers and figures could greatly benefit whoever is trying to learn and others across long distances designing things is an art i little box with buttons drawn on a piece of paper won't help anyone also defining art would be good as for business people you could probably get along with a lot of math and statistical analyzing but in all fields of business you'd have to write things and communicate things which the average person could understand whether or not the business person can do this he'd still need a professional or his most unwanted pathetic skills you'd probably still need an editor for articles on business and new efficient ideas for the big businesses how would business need artists well i'd say that if a business centered around magazines you'd definitely need some kind of artist oh and remember that a painting is worth a thousand words answer society could not function one without the other  Software engineering Intelligent design Microeconomics Software testing Mathematics Goodness and value theory Sexual orientation Computer Art Modernism Science Copyleft Photography Requirements analysis Thermodynamics Graphics W.

do people who are different get along better than people who are the same what i mean by that is people who have different thoughts ideas looks on life interests hobbies etc do they get along better than people who do have the same interests interesting analysis and one which i'm certain would spark much controversy from the answerers here's my theory since opposites attracts it would seem more likely than not for people whom are different to get along better such is not the case they might be attracted to the differences in the other but they probably won't be able to get along that well because in all actuality a person generally needs some air of familiarity in order to mingle and converse comfortably so if the other person is too different they might find that there is very little that they share have in common with one another but on the flip side of that coin an individual might be looking to learn and grow within themselves and would better benefit from someone who is their polar opposite see what i mean it can go either way  Social psychology Coercion Autism Altruism Supply and demand Philosophy of language Objectivist philosophy Blog Asperger syndrome Sexual orientation Logic Reparative therapy Roe v.

bed i have my good days but most of the time it's hard for me to function in daily life and i can't do all the things i want to do i also get headaches severe period cramps lightheadedness and fatigue i get sharp pains in my stomach and back that sometimes bring me to my knees i'm a pretty tough year old but have cried several times from the pain and feeling helpless also over the counter meds like tylenol and midol don t help me at all berry here's some paxil doc hello doctor i've had serious stomach problems for about years including sharp pains discomfort frequent gas diarrhea and constipation i eat healthy most of the time and don't eat fast food i think my stomach problems have resulted from my teenage partying phase where i drank and did drugs i have quit these bad habits but have continued to have problems berry here's some imodium ad doc i feel these doctors don t take me seriously and they just hand me a useless prescription without running tests asking me questions or even giving advice about diet and exercise or what could be causing my problems at such a young age are my problems too complicated and they don t want to deal with them do they think i m lying or imagining it where can i find good healthcare with a caring doctor who will take me seriously and actually try to help in the meantime i ve been self medicating with loritabs for over a year because it s the only thing i ve found that has eased my pain and made it so i can function and have a normal life this is a great question i once took a class from a social scientist edward shorter who mid career went to medical school got his m d and studied the doctor patient relationship he has a books out see below but one titled called doctors and their patients is particularly interesting it's a short rather quick read it is amazing what he finds to be true throughout the history of medicine western medicine the stuff you're talking about the history of medicine begins with the history of wealthy or at least high status white men though this is changing now trying to find out what is 'wrong' with white women though this is changing recently now that non white women are gaining access to medical care it only gets more interesting as i understand the history of medicine as presented in sociology of history courses the answers to your questions are likely to be as follows doctors often don't know how to take you seriously they are educated traditionally in chemistry and knowledge of pharmaceuticals but not in the doctor patient relationship or bedside manner most doctors are caught off gaurd at their first dealings with actual human beings because medical school has prepared them not for these social interactions but for finding pathogens so your doctor may be a caring person but may not actually be able to meet your complete needs as a patient and this is a large problem you are correct about the useless prescription these are used to calm patients down if you get very curious about this go to the library and compare dsm to dsm dsm is diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders the manual doctors use to diagnose different mental health problems the symptoms of a condition in dsm may be symptoms of an entirely new or different condition listed in dsm dsm is the more recent manual what these changes mean is that these mental disorders are at best constructed by modern medicine and are at worst made up compare these two things yourself what once was called hystrionic personality is now borderline personality disorder the histories of anorexia and hypogycemia are also very interesting according to another health researcher michael marmot diet and exercise are common unhelpful explanations of people's health as i see this explanation it is easy to blame a patient's health on the patient when focus is on diet and exercise i e it gets the doctor and anyone else off of the hook according to shorter at the time of his lecture in doctors will sometimes diagnose patients with 'somatization disorders' meaning that their ill health is all in their head it could be that your doctor thinks that you are creating this situation for yourself to find a doctor who takes you seriously call local clinics and tell the receptionist that you are 'looking to establish' with a doctor ask who is currently accepting patients and then ask to set an appointment with the doctors who are accepting patients you should not be charged for these appointments they take place in the doctor's office not the examining room keep in mind that this is not the time to share your medical history unless you are asked it is not the time to get an opinion or be diagnosed it is a chance for you to interview the doctor and find out about his her bedside manner how they intend to treat you make it clear to each doctor you visit with that you absolutely must be taken seriously and that you require attention to detail and elimination of all reasonable explanations as to your pain this means running tests these interviews will be very brief maybe minutes remember it's not an exam so let the doctor explain his her philosophy and bedside manner fyi according to shorter dizzy lightheaded and fatigued are red flags to doctors they really don't know what to do with this information and they are likely to diagnose a somatization disorder again see dsm and dsm for these interesting explanations if your symptoms are stemming from a depressing situation or condition a holistic psychologist or counselor might help you get a handle on greater causes of the conditions whew sorry so long but i hope it helps the books by shorter should be very enlightening i recommend them over the book by marmot but it's not bad either extemely sociological while the other two are historical  A Course In Miracles Crohn's disease Insomnia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Dieting Social psychology

questions about sociology that are very interesting and confused me a lot please share your opinion inequality permeates educational institutions as jonathan kozol s essay shows what specific inequalities in education does he note do you see these reflected in the school in your community how does kozol s description of urban schools show a connection between race and class inequality one way that sociologists think about education is as a route to social mobility others see education as only reproducing the inequalities that exist in society as you observe education today what evidence do you see for each of these perspectives on the role of education in society i don't think my opinion will help here because these appear to be questions for a class you are taking but i can provide some information of course this will not be directly relevant to whatever answers you have to come up with but i will try to clarify the questions first i assume we're both familiar with kozol's work kozol lists actual resources that are found in some schools but not in others this is what the question means by inequality permeating educational institutions some schools have some have not you can pick out the specific things that are present in some schools but not in others as noted by kozal according to your interest in them the next part of this question asks whether these same resources were unequally distributed among schools in your own community kozol describes how some schools have resources that other schools lack and therefore what children have and lack certain resources children of a certain race class have while kids of another race class do not kozol points out a strong connection between race class and unequal distribution of resources needs in schools 'education as a route to social mobility' means that when someone in a society is educated they have more and greater opportunities to succeed 'education as reproducing the inequalities that exist in society' means that the cream rises to the top that education functions to sort people according to their natural gifts and talants the first is of conflict or critical marxist theory the other is of consensus theory or functionalist perspective the question then asks you to decide which perspective conflict or consensus fits your observations the best i really have no idea what examples cases you've looked at so i hope that restating the questions has clarified them a bit good luck with your ideas  Capitalism Labor theory of value Economic inequality Law of value Philosophy of language Sociology Sociocultural evolution Anarchism and capitalism Social psychology Jonathan Kozol Economics Ethics Democracy Culture Social justice Philosophy of science Feudalism State Postmodernism Karl Marx Anarchism and society Deconstruction Relations of production Libertarian socialism Anthropology Microeconomics Autism Frankfurt School Education Sociology of religion Tripartite System Surplus product Power (sociology) Exploitation Intelligent design Second language acquisition Capital accumulation Science Theory of conduct Feminism Sexual orientation Liberalism Philosophy of education Objectivist philosophy Voter turnout War Intelligence quotient Consensus decision-making Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Transformation problem Scientific method John Rawls Bayes' theorem Criticism of libertarianism Education in the People's Republic of China Surplus value Extreme Programming Intelligent design movement Universal pragmatics Anarchism Political economy GED Tonality Autism rights movement Goodness and value theory Altruism Natural deduction Jean-Jacques Rousseau Antonio Gramsci Psychology Bureaucracy Cultural relativism School of Salamanca Unemployment Property (ownership right) Epistemology Simone Weil The Bell Curve A New Kind of Science Karl Popper Meaning of life Social Criticisms of socialism History of science Anarcho-capitalism Market failure Free trade Pseudoscience Noam Chomsky Primitive accumulation of capital Philosophy of mathematics Teach the Controversy Productive and unproductive labour Family Bayesian inference Open source culture

is it racist to mock people for being ginger isn't it still predicated on the same basis as racism that of treating others adversely on the basis of outwardly visible genetic difference its in the same vein it is attaching significance to a difference between people and changing behaviour as a result however i belive it is not as serious or as common as racism because ultimately its only about hair colour which it is possible for the person with ginger hair to change whereas one cannot changes ones ethnicity or race generally ginger people have not suffered and do not continue to suffer the overt discrimination handed out by racists to people from ethnic minorities and ultimately racism and discrimination relates to the power relationship between two individuals mocking of people with ginger hair may be a covert form of racism the incidence of ginger hair is far higher among certain ethnic groups generally scottish and irish people so it may be that the ginger hair is the symbol for expressing racist feelings about those particular ethnic groups  Racism Affirmative action Nationalism Black (people) Human Zionism and racism Race and intelligence Racial segregation African American contemporary issues Ethnocentrism White (people) Patriotism Economic inequality Discrimination Melanin The Bell Curve Anti-Defamation League Gender role Rastafari movement British National Party Human sexual behavior Classism Homophobia White separatism Civil rights Baldness Color blindness Race of Jesus Racism in the United States Culture Race in biomedicine Validity of human races Arab-Israeli conflict Anti-racism Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Hate speech Race Colonial mentality Ethnic group Aesthetic Realism Species Asian fetish Multiculturalism Model minority Ethnic issues in Japan Human skin color Race war Korean adoptee Nazism Racialism Puberty Transculturation Reparations for slavery Indigenous peoples of the Americas Psychology Aryan race Anti-Semitism Turkic peoples Epeli Ganilau Neo-Nazism Self-hatred Media and ethnicity Pioneer Fund Eugenics African American Dehumanization Clothing Anglosphere Autism Speciesism New anti-Semitism Utilitarianism White trash Institutional racism White privilege (sociology) American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) History of South Africa in the apartheid era Who is a Jew?

what would you consider more important a large friends base or a small family unit a small family unit friends come and go true it helps to have connections in the larger world ultimately these connections benefit the family unit frankly a large base of friends how sure can one be that all can be on the same page the larger group can be easily given to fracturing and splintering backstabing one up drama aside from a cult etc thus how close how reliable how true can any of the larger group be called friends within a small family unit devotion can be demonstrated or not at home on a day to day basis those within can recipricate accordingly as the adults recpricate and demostrate and reinforce the behaviors both the investment and the rewards are more intense also a small group of frineds may also feel strong connections it is possible for this to spring out of a good working envirnment unxpected to any of the participates as each on contributes a job well done and the others respect him her for the job contiually well done all in all the respectful communication and responsiblity are paramount in building all these connections  Economic inequality Second language acquisition Interpersonal relationship Infantilism Anarchism and society Dog training Behaviorism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Baptist Fundamentalism Alignment (role-playing games) Hikikomori Moral Politics Autism Bone fracture David Hume Religious Society of Friends Prisoner's dilemma Polyamory Patriotism Scouting Labor theory of value John Wycliffe Past teachings of Prem Rawat Community Church of Christ Social psychology Aesthetic Realism Friendship Hospitality service Motivation One Tree Hill (TV series) Sadism and masochism Cult Weight training Alcoholics Anonymous Current teachings of Prem Rawat Pitaten Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Goodness and value theory Dyslexia Child sexuality Free trade Objectivist philosophy Supply-side economics FidoNet Special relationship Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Unemployment Theory of conduct Conservatism Enterprise content management Confucius Labour economics Crime prevention through environmental design Single Transferable Vote The Chronicles of Amber History of the British canal system Status of religious freedom in Germany Leadership A Course In Miracles Philosophy of language Loudspeaker Biology and sexual orientation Liu Bocheng Japan-United States relations Harry Nilsson Equine conformation Pension Wind turbine Fight Club Asperger syndrome Carburetor ARPANET Deaf culture Nicomachean Ethics Church of Scientology Dog agility Civilization III Manitoba Hydro Kurt Angle M16 (rifle) Maritimes Bird Economy of the United Kingdom Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Simone Weil Brian May Charles Darwin's views on religion Transsexuality Chosen people Diplomacy (game) Hillary Rodham Clinton Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Anorexia nervosa Marshall Plan Bretton Woods system Emergence Social network

why can't some people distinguish fiction from reality let's take the tv show friends for example when gunther told rachel that ross cheated on her some fangirl in real life bumped into the actor who plays gunther and just gave him a death stare and chewed him out for telling rachel about ross or fans would run into one of the writers and ask if ross and rachel are going to get together as if they're real people or if an actor plays a retarded character in a tv movie the actor gets treated like a retard or stupid when he's really not why do people do this don't they know that acting is just acting that those characters aren't real it's just a show and entertainment this has been studied i heard apparently people who watch a tv show regularly come to regard the regular characters as friends otherwise there might be schizophrenia involved scary  Friends Gunther (Friends character) Actor Neighbours Red Dwarf Rachel Green Law & Order War of the Worlds (2005 film) Little Britain MTV Joey Tribbiani Humphrey Bogart Professional wrestling slang Phoebe Buffay Family Matters (TV series) Mental illness Case Closed Television program Extras (sitcom) Hogan's Heroes Days of our Lives The One With the Blackout About a Boy A Beautiful Mind Highlander (film) The West Wing (television) Mental retardation Theory of conduct Another World (TV series) Blue Heelers Psychosis Garfield Ross Geller Intelligence quotient Social rule Tolkien fandom Tony Hancock Saturday Night Live Andy Kaufman Alias (TV series) Prank flash The Price Is Right Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan Lisa Simpson The Inside Soap opera The Mary Tyler Moore Show Janice (Friends character) Chuck Cunningham syndrome The Truman Show Phoebe Buffay's songs Slash fiction Bullitt Chandler Bing Jeopardy! in culture Butters Stotch Paul Is Dead Peter Griffin Teen Girl Squad Something Awful Seinfeld Midnight Run Care Bears Superman III Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Motion picture rating system The Ashlee Simpson Show Big Brother (USA TV series) Controversies in autism Batman The Supremes Minor characters in Seinfeld Scary Go Round Channel 4 Nutrition The Godfather Narrator EastEnders Eric Cartman Guy Chambers Rachelle Waterman War of the Worlds (television) Savage Dawn The O.C.

do you ever wish body modification would quit being looked down upon i seriously wish it wasn't a determining a factor when determining job employment yes i do i would like to have blue hair you know not a real big on the body mod scale but blue hair is detrimental to what i want out of life it's a stupid sacrifice that i have to make simply because the color doesn't occur naturally and therefore doesn't fit in the profession i've chosen why would i want to dye my hair blue it doesn't make a difference and there's nothing wrong with brown hair blah blah blah when you get right down to it we all wear decoration every day we style our hair we wear clothes accessories shoes and drive vehicles that we use to decorate ourselves with as much as possible with as much individuality as possible and still conform with the social landscape the color of my hair harms no one if i want to pierce or tattoo myself i'm harming no one what business is it of anyone's how i choose to decorate myself others expect me to not judge them on their choices of decoration the difference between a nose piercing and a navy blue business suit is cultural acceptance and nothing else in india a woman with a nose piercing is feminine not disgusting in iran a woman in an armani business suit with a knee length skirt is a whore not professional people who judge the worth of others by their appearance alone such as the hypocrite who assumes a person is bad because they have piercings beyond his or her idea of acceptable will probably never understand that their opinions are nothing more than their own conformation to cultural dictates these cultural dictates are good in some ways and just as bad in others if we were all conformists we should change the name of the nation to stepford and wear uniforms the reality is that people want the right to be individuals however they like but they don't want anyone else to have the right to be individuals unless that individuality conforms to their idea of what's acceptable it's the old idea of you can do whatever you like so long as i think it's okay this applies to adults who have the legal and moral right to their own decisions and the consequences from them not to children  Clothing Gender role Physical attractiveness Suit (clothes) Tattoo Body piercing Goodness and value theory Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Theory of conduct Kimono Abortion debate Social justice Morality Value system Determinism Skinhead Punk fashion Heavy metal fashion Social aspects of clothing Ethics Barbie Art Sexual orientation Economics Mediation Infantilism Han Chinese clothing Evil Human nature Comanche Victorian fashion Insurance Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Body modification Diving Scientology beliefs and practices Theodicy Human Undergarment Gender-neutral language Political correctness Extreme Programming Kilt Social psychology Microeconomics Democracy School uniform Cross-dressing Religion Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Meme Paul Is Dead Fashion Little Britain Single Transferable Vote Sento Polyamory Conscription Human physical appearance Textile manufacturing terminology Economic inequality Hair Japanese tea ceremony Transactional analysis W.I.T.C.H.

is there any info on cultural religious and racial implications of patient care in the prehospital setting you need to be looking in the right places for this information i can only speak from experience in the uk but the health service is very aware that there are certain social cultural groups who shy away from medical treatment it is especially so in the asian community in britain this is sometimes due to language barriers sometimes down to religion muslim women not wanting to see male doctors etc and sometimes lack of education some ethnicities are more susceptible to certain illnesses than others for example west indians are more susceptible to high blood pressure and diabetes this should therefore be checked at every routine visit to a doctor to identify a problem early and medicate accordingly many social clubs groups etc for people of a certain ethnicity will have information displayed in relevant languages on posters and in leaflets at the community centre or wherever they meet sometimes social workers visit the homes of people they feel aren't getting the right medical care obviously this helps if the social worker can speak the same language as the client or has an interpreter present the family often offer to interpret but then we can't be sure the client has actually been given the correct facts it's an incredibly complicated issue and you need to research it thoroughly http www sciencedaily com releases htm http www kcl ac uk depsta ccm ccm stroke html http www rethink org about mental illness who does it affect black minority ethnic groups index html those will get you going it's very easy to research if you use the right keywords and look for different cultural centres where you live then when you find the local african american community centre or whatever sorry us uk language barrier try calling or visiting and ask ask what's done now to assist that particular ethnicity with medical care what could be improved how have things changed have they changed for better or worse speaking to people who devote their lives to helping people can only enrich yours best of luck  Medicine Stroke World Wide Web Mental illness AIDS Bipolar disorder Coeliac disease Transsexuality Divorce Cross site scripting Race in biomedicine Autism Affirmative action Reparative therapy Sexual orientation HTML Traumatic brain injury Psychoanalysis Medical record Alcoholics Anonymous Chinese University of Hong Kong National Health Service Publicly funded medicine Hindu Chronic fatigue syndrome Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Hearing impairment Insulin Nurse Crohn's disease Scientology beliefs and practices Prostate cancer Anorexia nervosa White (people) Jew Obesity Psychology Dissociative identity disorder Autism rights movement Aphasia Pneumonia Sigmund Freud Childbirth Hypoglycemia Social work Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Internet Chiropractic American Red Cross Psychiatry Hypnosis Diabetes mellitus Nationalism Clinical depression Stomach cancer Magical thinking Cornelia Rau Traditional Chinese medicine Health insurance Alzheimer's disease HyperText Transfer Protocol Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Hypertension Education in the United States Baldness South Africa Asperger syndrome Cytomegalovirus Franz Boas Anti-psychiatry Adoption Hispanic Hikikomori Schizophrenia Religion Fecal incontinence Palliative care Who is a Jew?

apart from the obvious physical differences are men and women really that different in perspective i personally think we are experiencing a cultural collective hangover from the strict mores of polite victorian society rules she certainly didn't apply to herself i won't be around much over the next couple of days look forward to reading any replies tho cracked up laughing luminous must admit i wasn't born then i'm an archaeologist historian evidence shows that strong divisions very probably didn't exist at all until comparatively recent history prehistory nor does it appear to have been an issue in many recent civilisations such as the minoans indus the celts anglo saxons emerging evidence about the vikings i really could go on a different story emerges if one casts aside prejudicial views undoubtedly there have been times when both sexes have been the more dominant in polite society both still managed to make their presence strongly felt tho the more populous lower classes have always been the least affected by this in real terms too survival was their issue i too have researched many studies in depth mike h what stands out to me despite our current cultural conditioning is how close we are on all the traits you mention the average variation is pretty small in fact crossover traits are inclined to dominate also being academically able is definitely not the only proof of intelligence it does seem that girls were deliberately marked down in the past and have always been high achievers academically an educational bod of the 's 's and 's in england admitted on national tv that if girls had been marked the same way as boys boys grammar schools would have been full of girls too intelligence to me is the ability to take in inwardly digest and interpret information productively yep hippie victorian mores had a massive effect on western society fullstop much evidence of more equal cultures abound in german history tho lol and naff orf pataodelamuerte time to get vegetarianist now is it on your bike mister hmmm i absolutely do not agree that women are more emotional think in our current cultural climate women are just allowed to express and be comfortable with their emotional side more than men are that's a product of our culture not inherent tendencies because of these influences i would say if anything women are more pragmatic currently more able to stand back and assess objectively as opposed to men currently being more reactive erm it's mea culpa bletherskyte and although i don't agree with either zeb's or your answer at all i don't see why you think his reply is your fault perhaps you are his mentor swami guru joking aside human nature and sexuality are so much more complex than answers such as these show such views belong to the culturalised populist men are from mars women are from venus school of thought representative of the current culture we do seem to be slowly recovering from at last if current evidence is not viewed prejudicially it does appear that the women nurturers men providers view is a newish one the more we discover about humans from archaeological evidence the more we find the likelihood of both sexes sharing roles women only playing a quieter role while pregnant or rearing young children the beginning of the change from goddess to god worship seems to have given rise to problems in some civilisations but most were little affected until the age of empires began the men want sex women want love school of thought is a very new phenomenon in our history both enjoy purely recreational sex and penetration is only one aspect of it the term foreplay doesn't exist in my book some of the worst abuses of women occurred because of some cultures believing all women would be nymphomaniacs if not controlled examples being the athenians basically sequestering high born women on marriage until several children had been born it was believed that women were uncontrollably promiscuous and insatiable by nature wild with the need for multi orgasms and the horrendous mutilation known as female circumcision and look at the roman christianised view of women that we were all carnal temptresses intent on luring sweet innocent men to our beds or wherever and hell it's actually only a few western cultures nations that have such unrealistic views about human sexuality the profusion of eastern middle eastern ancient erotica indicates most had have a more balanced view cracked up laughing barney i did do well here mister for one who wouldn't be around much this is an interesting post it kept me well entertained until i went out i personally really like the answers of hippie luminous patodelamuerte and k marx leaving this post open for a while yet tho and i like pickles answer this won't be an easy choice before i choose best answer i'd like to apologise to bletherskyte previously i had only read you opening comments in your answer having now read it fully i must say it was a pretty decent answer cracked up laughing don't you fear for poor li'l defenceless women we definitely have our fair share of the physically aggressive actually i'd say that female on male violence is a much underrated problem our current culture doesn't take it seriously violence is wrong to me whatever the source aaarrrgghhh bill's answer is excellent too this is hard men and women are human beings first and foremost and there are no real differences in the mental make up it's not just the victorian society where all these hang ups come from we have them in germany too it's an old thing and it's about time to recognise that women have the same capacities as men and should be treated as equals in manner and in pay  Simone Weil Democracy Gender role Feminism Anglo-Saxons Franz Boas

when a child isn't trained to speak truths or refrain from taking other ppl's belongings without permission it will end up in later years mean unreliable corrupted how true is this any other qualities practices do u think are equally essential for a meaningful and fulfilled life your kind observations and opinions will be truly treasured question will be closed within hrs with a few good answers thinking caps on quick training children to speak the truth is a tricky proposition the whole truth and nothing but the truth is tricky and can be embarrassing teaching children to tell the truth also involves teaching them to be tactful and courteous social skills are not always couched in great truth telling great aunt maggie that her breath smells bad and her dress is ugly even when it's the truth isn't socially acceptable and a child would get scolded for saying these things add to that the fact that a child's sense of self preservation will push him her to lie to save themselves from punishment or unpleasant consequences and you have a budding story teller on your hands perhaps the better question is how do you teach a child to tell the essential truth truth essential to integrity essential to fairness essential to right living these are the truths we should teach the children to tell this is where we often fail when the society is based on the wiifm concept what's in it for me most of the difficulties people face and most of the stress we cause one another is based on our desire to be first have the best keep what's ours get what others have and generally put ourselves ahead of anyone else in the world we teach children via media sports video games tv movies and our own table talk that being first is best no matter what we don't stand up for what's right every time our child hears us lie too sick to come to work every time our child see us steal wow i got two cans of soda out of the machine for the cost of one thier loss they learn to lie and steal it's a simple equation see learn i believe that we must teach our children to love themselves without being in love with themselves care about others' feelings more than their own recognize their talents develop their skills turn what they love doing into their professions and put other people ahead of self interest to teach it we have to live it the equation is the same see learn maybe not easy if your weren't raised that way may take a revamping of your own lifestyle to reflect what you want them to learn but it can be done  Theory of conduct Merit Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Scientology beliefs and practices Social rule Philosophy of language Simone Weil Alexander Technique Lie Logic Jiddu Krishnamurti Ten Commandments Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Ethics Scientific method Infantilism Eastern Orthodox Church Moral relativism Goodness and value theory A Course In Miracles Current teachings of Prem Rawat Resurrection of Jesus Sexual orientation Stuttering Philosophical skepticism Abortion debate Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Plame affair Extreme Programming Yusuf al-Qaradawi Roman Catholic Church Theodicy Summa Theologiae Education in the People's Republic of China Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Dog training The Amber Spyglass Mojave people Meaning of life Religious pluralism Property (ownership right) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Scouting Opus Dei Buddhism Determinism Utilitarianism English grammar Pitaten S__ren Kierkegaard God Emperor of Dune Soul Rudolf Hermann Lotze John Howard Yoder Victor Cousin Aikido Reality Numerology Collision detection Martial art John Wycliffe Socrates Software engineering Slander and libel Stoicism Microeconomics God Singlish Halting problem Arthur Cayley Volleyball Poker jargon Religion Kender Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Kim Possible Sant Mat Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Rick Santorum Cultural relativism Divorce Objectivist philosophy Polyamory Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Gospel of Thomas Characters in the Smurfs Martin Heidegger

what is your opinion on abortion keep this in mind political views religious views views from each gender what if the doctor says giving birth to the baby would kill the mother and the baby who agrees with this theory if people give up there children for adoption or just throw them away somewhere these unwanted and uncared for children will grow up to become the next generation of criminals nobody taught these forsaken children any better so as a result these children will bring the crime rate up world wide or what about god is very angry that we are murdering inocent children that is why he brought hurricane katrina and this war in the middle east upon us my opinion is that it is a very difficult decision that a woman has to make it should not be used as a form of birth control and the woman should have access to counseling before and after to deal with the trauma this decision may cause her a woman's body is her own to make choices with and this should not involve any males  Domestic violence Abortion Democracy Transsexuality Gender role Religion and abortion Mother Teresa Androgen insensitivity syndrome Partial-birth abortion Fathers' rights Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Roe v.

is gandhism relevant today yes i believe that nonviolence prevents stacking additional burdens on the given problem or conflict so that instead of compounding a conflict more as in the middle east there is less mess and damage to deal with in order to address the root cause of oppression so the injustice can be resolved so yes in terms of nonviolence i think this is very critical to communication and conflict resolution that is required for global change however i think more is needed than passive resistance normally associated with gandhi such as getting arrested to publicize protests which merely empowers the current system of authority and media bias toward negative conflict and discrediting opponents i think what is called for today is not civil disobedience but civil obedience where citizens enforce just civil standards as equal responsibility of the government and do not accept to be criminalized but turn the tables and correct the injustice that is criminal to invoke and act upon equal authority as government requires absolute nonviolence diplomacy civil respect and cooperative agreement with given authority otherwise it would be discredited as a disorderly or violent rebellion that disrespects public safety and current authority instead of challenging unjust laws by breaking them making it clear that the parties allowing injustice are the ones disobeying higher laws about equal protections and enforcing solutions as meeting the legal standards this requires both the same organization and unity as previous reform movements but also direct diplomacy and cooperation with the conflicting institutions not division or opposition there must be a balance between respecting given authorities and institutions while equally empowering the people whose consent is the basis of government and social contracts in a civilized society so this is a step beyond the choices most people consider how to work with the given institutions and policies and people to invoke the change together by agreement by political force of unity and respect for mutual laws and standards not by forcing change by negative opposition and competition i think that is the difference that is needed in the world in order to achieve change on the next level it involves the principles of gandhi but takes them even further where everyone is on the same side solving problems as a team  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Liberalism Nonviolence Social justice Democracy Mahatma Gandhi Appeal Mediation Christian anarchism Nonviolent resistance Anti-globalization Affirmative action Unlawful combatant Civil rights Contract Conservatism Federal World Government International Criminal Court Pacifism Treaty Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Law Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Government of India American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Indian Independence Movement Oslo Accords Ethics Same-sex marriage Worldwide green parties Corporate governance Arab-Israeli conflict Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Separation of church and state Libertarian socialism Consensus decision-making Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Human rights Microeconomics Indira Gandhi Domestic violence Libertarianism Gay rights Free trade Property (ownership right) Anarchism Globalization Constitution of Ireland Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Nationalism Martin Luther King, Jr. Law of the People's Republic of China Civil disobedience Projects working for peace among Israelis and Arabs American individualist anarchism International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict Bretton Woods system Jos__ Luis Rodr__guez Zapatero Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) State Vicente Fox Gandhism Social contract Government of France Anarcho-capitalism Zapatista Army of National Liberation Precautionary principle Same-sex marriage in Canada Nuclear option (filibuster) Comecon Freedom of speech Copyright History of South Africa in the apartheid era First Amendment to the United States Constitution Neville Chamberlain Cyprus dispute International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement American liberalism Tax resistance Supreme Court of the United States Equal Protection Clause Politics of the People's Republic of China Surveillance Involuntary commitment Crime Estoppel Trade union Politics of Russia Postmodernism United States House of Representatives

why in some countries are adults referred to as boyfriend or girlfriend instead of manfriend or womanfriend it seems silly to refer to adults using juvenile words language is a reflection of its culture some other terms have emerged such as significant other or partner but they seem somewhat impersonal in portraying a loved one what predominating attitudes and behavior are reflected by these terms what are the sociological implications boyfriend girlfriend refer's to the newness of the relationship what are boy's and girl's they are young and new fresh and beginning right so in a relationship it has the same implication's it's young new fresh etc when it get's to a serious level then the name changes to fiance or husband and wife significant other could refer to heterosexual's but where i am from when you use the term partner it usually refer's to a homosexual relationship hope that was helpful  Heterosexuality Homosexuality Bisexuality Infantilism Pedophilia Interpersonal relationship Lawrence v.

should prostitution be legalized i think so because then they could make the girls get health check ups and they could tax the money what is wrong with adults that consent to something anyway pot too for that matter well i really can't see much wrong with this and not really sure why it is not legal everywhere countries such as germany who have it legalized have no real problems with it if it was legalized the prostitutes would be provided more health information how to practice safe sex etc whereas now they are not provided this it would give a handy way for people who had the money to have some sex and have a little fun it would be great for singles people who had lost spouses etc and did not have a sex partner readily available and would eliminate the problem of having to wine and dine someone to get sex it would also give people the opportunity to fulfill some of their fantasies such as having more than one partner at the same time etc it would be good for the economy as the prostitutes would pay taxes along with the brothels etc i have heard that a big brothel in australia is even on their stock exchange the cops that waste their time trying to pick up people in stings etc could concentrate then on real crimes instead of arresting someone for having sex what a joke of couse the holier than thou hypocrites are going to tell you it is evil because they think sex in general and any kind of sexual pleasure is dirty but i really don't see this as a moral issue so i do think that this is a law that needs to be revisited and probably changed so that prostitution can be legal everywhere as i said the countries that have it legalized see more advantages than disadvantages  Prostitution Human sexual behavior Child pornography Consensual crime Marriage Age of consent Pornography Lawrence v.

why does society consider prostitution to be deviant in the sociological context it's based on the social more that sex is reserved for marriage if fornication and adultery are bad then prostitution can't coexist to remove the barrier to prostitution becoming legitimate we'd have to somehow remove the social demand that sex is deviant when it occurs outside of marriage over the past years this barrier has fallen considerably to the point that many people will say that extramarital sex is acceptable behavior under certain conditions when the majority societal norm is that extramarital recreational sex is acceptable behavior the prohibition on prostitution as we know it now will fall  Religion and sexuality Human sexual behavior Social psychology History of sex Adultery Age of consent Paraphilia Homosexuality Consensual crime Effeminacy Same-sex marriage Gender role Norm (sociology) Sexual orientation Prostitution Sexual intercourse Sociology Bisexuality Gay rights Sexual abstinence Promiscuity Human sexuality Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Sociology of deviance Sexual revolution Sex Divorce Pedophilia Drug abuse Prostitution of children Honor killing Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Chastity Transgender Political economy Human rights Nudity Polyamory Paragraph 175 Rape Gender Polygamy Sodomy law Interpersonal relationship Culture Zoophilia Homophobia Pornography Homosexuality and Hinduism Cross-dressing Mojave people Exploitation Heterosexuality Childlove movement Harm reduction __mile Durkheim Religion and sexual orientation Adolescence Power (sociology) Family Ethics Sexual norm Child sexuality Rick Santorum Transsexuality Social justice Moral panic Robert K.
