can a health care provider force a patient into a nursing home my father is elderly and this year has been suffering through multiple small strokes each one takes more and more of his motor skills away simply standing up is a lot of work and requires assistance now mom is there hours a day and us adult children are splitting shifts there to help out we are certain he doesn't have a lot of time left and none of us want him to go into a home although difficult and sometimes stressful we feel we can handle the responsibility now last night dad suffered another stroke this time it appears he was getting out of his recliner late at night and when the stroke happened he fell this instantly alerted us and we were able to assist but the doctors seem concerned that his falling may be a sign that we need him in an care facility in the end whose decision is it can the doctor force him into a care facility or does the family have the ultimate power to make that decision thank you all for your answers i wish i could award you all pts mom is deathly afraid that the doctor is going to make him leave his home i will pass on to her your answers this is a very hard position to be in i was in something similar not so long ago however there were other older people to make the final decision there are some cases where a medical professional can deem that someone is not safe in their own home however depending upon the legal precedents that your father set up he may be able to get the last say the hardest part about this whole thing is that the world forces you to learn policy procedure of living wills probate power of attorney etc etc rather than spending that time with your father mother and family i think what you your family are doing is exceptional and while it is just what you all would do there are so many people that would not i wish you and your family all of the strength in the world i do do what you feel is best and if it is for him to remain in his home then fight it i know it's a hassle and it makes reasonable people just shake their heads but while the medical world acts as if they are trying to keep your father 'safe' in actuality they are just making a ruling on a patient this is your father not a patient the man you've grown up with the man you love the man you've looked up to and for all of this he deserves to live his remaining time with those that love him most now if it is deemed that irrespective of all the people around that none of you are medically knowledgeable to care for him well then they may be able to force your hands no matter what let your mother know what a superior person she is it is never easy to say good bye however it is even harder to have someone force their decisions on your family i wish there was an easy answer but i think what you your family are doing is great and i extend the most sincere well wishes of strength love i wish you well i wish you peace  Nurse Medicine Divorce Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Abortion in the United States Fathers' rights Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Abortion debate Transactional analysis Certified Nursing Assistant Euthanasia Urinary incontinence Mental Health Act 1983 Consensus decision-making Prostate cancer Social rule Medicare (Canada) Appeal Theory of conduct Traumatic brain injury Transsexuality Medical prescription Scientology beliefs and practices Health insurance Ethics Abortion Contract Publicly funded medicine Stomach cancer Childbirth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Nursing Stroke Nursing home Involuntary commitment Medical record Free will Mother Teresa Hearing impairment Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Royal Assent British nationality law Theodicy Pitaten Roe v.

this may be the weirdest thing you ever hear ever since i was like years old and i am now i have picked my belly button yes you heard it correctly so we'll say about years or so i pick it like everywhere i go at night at school during the day discreetly when i am not at home and sometimes when the urge is so bad i do it through my shirt so i was just wondering what i can do to stop i am getting to the point that i am worried i am going to get some sort of like stomach infection or like something it's all like scabby and gross and like weird it's an innie so you can't really tell but if you have any ideas or concerns or anything please help me it can get really annoying and like embarrasing thanks so much ok so here's the problem you have a behavior that you have done for so long you can't stop it is a habit and you do it without even thinking about it so the question is do you really want to stop is it affecting your life in an adverse way sounds like it isn't a huge deal i never heard of anyone getting a belly button infection from picking too much if it is bugging you that much then it might be time to alter that behavior you shouldn't need to see a doctor unless you think there might be an infection people have little habits all the time i bite my nails constantly so there is a similarity there you are picking for some reason to keep your fingers busy to feel your belly button anxiety there can be a ton of different reasons the idea is to find out why and attack that side of the problem whatever you do don't try to substitute something else to pick besides your belly button like a bracelet this isn't stopping the behavior but transferring it eventually you will have to stop picking at the bracelet and won't be able to stop here are some things you can try wrap a string around the finger that you use to pick at it this may remind you to stop try to keep your hands busy doing other things chart when you do it is there a pattern are you more likely to do it at certain times of the day reward yourself with something say if i can go the whole day without picking i'll get a mocha or something else that you really want have other people remind you talk to your family though it might be embarrassing tell them to swat your hand every time you pick this will become annoying but it is effective hope this helps some  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Milton H.

can a lab test your blood for drugs without permission like can they say oh we just need to test for immunizations or whatever and then secretly test for drugs or do u have to sign a waiver any know i work in a lab and have found that each lab is different the short answer is no but if a parent of a minor or the doctor requests that a drug test be done that is legal usually urine is tested for drugs of abuse some drugs like prescription drugs or tylenol are done from blood but i wouldn't expect there to be any other reason to do it labs don't go around running tests they don't get paid to do taking a cue from tv shows i suppose if the blood has been drawn and a crime has been committed then the investigation will test the blood for confirmation of drug use this assumes the blood was drawn by a forensic team but they can requisition blood from private medical facilities ask your parents if it comes to that if you don't know they would i see no reason for your doctor to run tests on you without your knowledge but that would be the other source to the answer of your question  Drug test Plame affair Prostate cancer Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Pharmaceutical company Paracetamol Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma International Criminal Court Duesberg hypothesis 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Food and Drug Administration Schapelle Corby Forensics Methamphetamine Karl Rove Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Medical record Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus AIDS reappraisal Drunk driving (United States) Cancer Medical prescription Medical cannabis Controlled Substances Act Contract Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Urinalysis Ben Johnson (athlete) Plame affair timeline Cytomegalovirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Urinary incontinence Erythropoietin Illegal drug trade HIV test Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Tour de France Lupus erythematosus Psoriasis Rush Limbaugh Insulin Allergy Drug addiction Arguments for and against drug prohibition Psychiatric hospital Health insurance Medical laboratory Graduate school Prohibition (drugs) Folic acid Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Lance Armstrong Cocaine Expert system Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution Prescription drug Drug abuse Stomach cancer Shroud of Turin Project MKULTRA Endometriosis Hepatitis C Blood transfusion Probation officer Human sexual behavior Psychology 2001 anthrax attacks Stem cell Philosophical skepticism Rape LSD Kurt Cobain Abortion in the United States Physician Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Anorexia nervosa Terri Schiavo Hypertension Abortion debate Asthma Unit 731 Marc Dutroux Antiretroviral drug Pharmacopoeia Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia Publicly funded medicine Surveillance Hepatitis Coeliac disease Medicare (Canada) Tobacco smoking Growth hormone treatment The Caves of Androzani Eczema Blood alcohol content Killian documents West Memphis 3

does anyone know about vericose veins i have a vein that runs up my inner thigh and is very puffy it has been like this for a few years i am going to the doctor in a couple of weeks i just wanted to know if anyone has had anything similiar or what will the doctor do for this is there anything that will make this vein go back down to normal extended standing puts pressure on the varicosity and causes the swelling the valves in that vein are not working correctly and the blood can enter but doesn't leave properly your doctor will probably recommend support stockings which will compress the vein and she might suggest injections called scherotherapy that makes the vein shrivel up and at this point a secondary healthy vein takes over the transport of blood through this area there are also laser treatments she will recommend the best course years ago these veins were pulled out or stripped but now they prefer to save them in case you need them for angioplasty etc good luck and most medical plans pay for the stockings to a certain percentage  Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Aortic dissection Myocardial infarction Varicocele Intracranial pressure Vein Prostate cancer Dialysis Cellulitis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma First aid Coronary catheterization Heart Hypertension Intravenous therapy Mitral regurgitation Stomach cancer Atrial septal defect Great saphenous vein Fetus Deep vein thrombosis Insulin Acne Carpal tunnel syndrome Blood vessel Carburetor Bleeding Psoriasis Kidney Drowning Angioplasty Siphon Equine conformation Emergency Medical Services Suicide methods Chronic fatigue syndrome Atkins Nutritional Approach Obstetrics Professional wrestling holds Penis Gastroparesis Pneumothorax Stocking Hypoglycemia Coronary circulation Cardiovascular disease Cardiology Lethal injection Turner syndrome Liver Breech birth Team Fortress Classic Dermatology Traumatic brain injury Warren Buffett Obesity Strap-on dildo Atherosclerosis Lymphatic system Inferior vena cava Vitamin C Annuity Eczema Yarrow Diving suit Air embolism Aortic insufficiency Endocarditis Intravascular ultrasound Blood pressure Shock Renal cell carcinoma Cancer Adjustable gastric band Carbon dioxide Infusion pump Ocean's Twelve Pneumonia Mitral stenosis Blood on the Tracks Tourniquet Chlorpromazine Thrombophlebitis Massage Lung Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Breastfeeding Migraine Radiation therapy Scar Atheroma Heart valve Puberty Medicine Blood transfusion

why are doctors so stubborn when someone has an unusual combination of symptoms or a condition their doctor is not familiar with why are most doctors so mean about it or refuse to acknowledge it one time my throat closed up so much i could barely eat and my doctor thought i was just lying about it turned out to be anxiety related but i went down to pounds during the whole ordeal now i have shy bladder syndrome which will keep me from getting jobs because of the drug tests and i have yet to hear of any doctors who will acknowledge verify it just because they didn't learn about it in medical school i guess this is mostly a question for doctors why the heck are you guys so stubborn about this stuff this is a social phobia fear of peeing with anyone near you including family and friends the fear is real the inability to pee is a medical and psychological problem but the problem is most doctors and many psychologists don't understand the problem or even know about the problem you are suffering when i was your age i could never go in school after the th grade i held my pee all day from in the morning until in the afternoon when i got home if i was lucky my mother wouldn't listen at the door to hear me pee for minutes as a result of holding my bladder grew larger and i was able to hold more but it took a lot of pain my first suggestion is to look up on the internet www paruresis org paruresis is the medical name click on the talk forum and go to talk about it you will be asked to register use a made up name and password for the sake of privacy in the usa there are about million sufferers from paruresis mostly men the usual onset is about to years of age although many start earlier and some after age you are not alone the leaders of the web site are paruretics themselves they and i learned how to deal with the problem often cognitive psychotherapy is a help the sufferers and the leaders of the organization have compassion and understand what you are going through anxiety and depression are common in the sufferers like your self incidently i have improved a lot since my high school days largely from the help of the international paruresis association you can too a good book to begin with is dr steven soifer's shy bladder syndrome you can get it through the organization and also from amazon com your privacy is guaranteed incidently i am a psychotherapist and a recovering paruretic who has gone through the hell of having an easily locked bladder i empathize with you all the way of recovering  Psychotherapy Traumatic brain injury Clinical depression Anxiety Chronic fatigue syndrome Prostate cancer Medicine Post-traumatic stress disorder Autism Antidepressant Milton H.

what is hospice for just want to know are they not for just the terminally ill anymore i'm afraid to answer because i don't know why you're asking this question but the only need for hospice care is to care for the terminally ill when a person finally agrees to hospice it means they won't go to the hospital anymore and won't see any more doctors the job of hospice workers is to make the person as comfortable as possible in their final days my uncle had hospice care at home the nurses were wonderful i hope this answers your question  Palliative care Terri Schiavo Medicine Mental Health Act 1983 Mother Teresa Cardiac arrest Vivian Solon Fight Club Nurse Health insurance Reiki Publicly funded medicine Division of labour Nursing home Talking Heads (plays) Nursing AFI 100 Years series Retirement Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Psychiatry Pok__mon Live!

what is inguinial hernia i saw it once and also is a blood pressure of good inguinal hernias are protrusions of abdominal cavity contents through the inguinal canal they are very common and their repair is one of the most frequently performed surgical operations there are two types of inguinal hernia direct and indirect direct inguinal hernias occur when abdominal contents herniate through a weak point in the fascia of the abdominal wall and into the inguinal canal indirect inguinal hernias occur when abdominal contents protrude through the inguinal ring this is ultimately caused by failure of embryonic closure of the internal inguinal ring as for blood pressure well there's some debate about exactly where normal ends and abnormal begins a blood pressure of to over to is called high normal in some countries such as the us it's sometimes known as 'prehypertension' because although the person doesn't have hypertension at this stage they're likely to develop it in the future but what's acceptable can also depend on your age as our blood pressure normally tends to increase as we get older and other factors such as time of the day stress levels temperature and so on  Cryptorchidism Androgen insensitivity syndrome Intersex surgery Abdomen Aortic dissection Atrial septal defect Blood pressure Cephalic disorder Obstetrics Stroke Pneumonia Kidney Mesothelioma Hypertension Atherosclerosis Cirrhosis William Stewart Halsted Hypoglycemia Aortic aneurysm Intracranial pressure Urinary incontinence Abortion Turner syndrome Hypospadias Traumatic brain injury Dialysis Mitral regurgitation Diabetes mellitus Brain tumor Vomiting Ovarian cancer Puberty Equine conformation Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Hemorrhagic stroke Angina Spark plug Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Welding Group A streptococcal infection Menstrual cycle Cancer Bowel obstruction IgA nephropathy Fecal incontinence Jet engine Aortic insufficiency Gastroesophageal reflux disease Prostate cancer Von Willebrand disease Bilirubin Sleep Tooth Post-traumatic stress disorder Atrial fibrillation Stomach cancer Ectopic pregnancy Acromegaly Polycystic kidney disease Obesity Pulmonary alveolus Exercise Pulmonary hypertension Stopping power Cardiovascular disease Pressure Internal oblique Decompression sickness Peritoneum Chronic renal failure Nephrotic syndrome Hiatus hernia Cardiac stress test Diabetic ketoacidosis Hypovolemia Carpal tunnel syndrome Myasthenia gravis Heart sounds Abdominal surgery Metabolic syndrome Coronary heart disease Coagulation Atheroma Physical examination Varicocele Temporal bone Valsalva maneuver Aspartame Colorectal cancer Wood

i stop breathing and jerk myself awake right when i fall asleep what should i do sounds like you have slep apnoea possibly you need to see your doc for sure obstructive sleep apnoea osa is defined as the cessation of airflow during sleep preventing air from entering the lungs caused by an obstruction these periods of 'stopping breathing' only become clinically significant if the cessation lasts for more than seconds each time and occur more than times every hour osa only happens during sleep as it is a lack of muscle tone in your upper airway that causes the airway to collapse during the day we have sufficient muscle tone to keep the airway open allowing for normal breathing when you experience an episode of apnoea during sleep your brain will automatically wake you up usually with a very loud snore or snort in order to breathe again people with osa will experience these wakening episodes many times during the night and consequently feel very sleepy during the day they have an airway that is more likely to collapse than normal osa can range from very mild to very severe the severity is often established using the apnoea hypopnoea index ahi which is the number of apnoeas plus the number of hypopnoeas per hour of sleep hypopnoea being reduction in airflow an ahi of less than is not likely to be associated with clinical problems to determine whether you are suffering from sleep apnoea you must first undergo a specialist 'sleep study' this will usually involve a night in hospital where equipment will be used to monitor the quality of your sleep the results will enable a specialist to decide on your best course of treatment the ultimate investigation is polysomnography which will include electro encephalography eeg brain wave monitoring electromyography emg muscle tone monitoring recording thoracic abdominal movements chest and abdomen movements recording oro nasal airflow mouth and nose airflow pulse oximetry heart rate and blood oxygen level monitoring electrocardiography ecg heart monitoring sound and video recording this is a very expensive investigation with few centres able to offer it routinely for all suspected sleep apnoea patients a 'mini' sleep study is more usual consisting of pulse oximetry and nursing observation home sleep study is becoming more popular osa is the commonest form of sleep apnoea about of men and of women but there is also a condition called central sleep apnoea csa this is a condition when the brain does not send the right signals to tell you to breathe when you are asleep in other words the brain 'forgets' to make you breathe it can also be associated with weakness of the breathing muscles the assessment for csa is often more complicated than for osa and the treatment has to be carefully matched to the patient's requirements there is also a condition called mixed sleep apnoea that is a combination of both obstructive and central sleep apnoea go ring your doc and make an app and good luck but remember if it is this once diagnosed you lose your drivers license but that is better than losing your life  Emphysema Medicine Cancer Insomnia Chronic fatigue syndrome Out-of-body experience Cephalic disorder Clinical depression Atrial fibrillation Shock Atherosclerosis Insulin Acute respiratory distress syndrome Lung cancer Decompression sickness Androgen insensitivity syndrome Dialysis Neurofeedback General anaesthesia Diabetes mellitus Cardiac arrhythmia Multiple sclerosis Hypnosis Weight training Tobacco smoking Prostate cancer Angina Ventricular fibrillation Aortic dissection Death Electroconvulsive therapy Myasthenia gravis Diazepam Migraine Hypertension Respiratory system Folic acid Cardiac arrest Electrocardiogram Chlorpromazine Terri Schiavo Pulmonary embolism Triage Psychosis Stomach cancer Eye Group A streptococcal infection Fuel injection Equine conformation Methamphetamine Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Puberty Syringomyelia 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Rebreather Pneumothorax Coronary heart disease Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Growth hormone treatment Physical therapy Panic attack Sickle-cell disease Acupuncture Poliomyelitis Cardiovascular disease Allergy Radiation therapy Hip fracture Lucid dreaming Autism Motor neurone disease Blood pressure Cystic fibrosis

i just quit smoking and i am having some strange responses i just quit smoking about days ago saturday night and i am having the normal cravings and figidiness but as of last night i had the most rotten sleep of my life and i was exhausted when i went to bed i woke up numerous times talking to myself and looking at the clock also i want to eat cheese a lot lots and lots of melted cheese this may be the strangest part of all my breasts are extremely sensitive sore now i read online that when you quit the nerve endings in your body begin to grow again and you may get strange sensations and food tastes better but it is almost like being pregnant i am at my rd day right now can someone tell me when it will get better i heard your rd day is the worst so hopefully it is all downhill from here i quit smoking weeks ago and sweetheart it's not an easy thing to do i have been a full fledged smoker for almost years meaning at least packs a day after watching my dad pass away from lung cancer in february among many other heartbreaking diseases i vowed to my mother that i would try my hardest to quit and i did the food cravings are normal your body is going through a hard time adjusting and may think it needs things it doesn't that is why a lot of people tend to gain weight when they quit smoking they begin to crave other things or they use food as a replacement for the hand to mouth habit your body is stressed and the first week or two are not gonna be too easy the best advice i can give you is to make sure you tell yourself that you are proud of yourself and that you really do want to quit try not to think about smoking or be around it much for the first two weeks the smell will still be enticing to you right now wait a couple weeks and people will begin to smell like ash trays that's when it gets easier good luck and stay strong  Tobacco smoking EastEnders Breastfeeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Social rule Urinary incontinence Vampire Kurt Cobain Cigarette Stomach cancer Equine conformation Fecal incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cheese Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Daylight saving time Atkins Nutritional Approach Coeliac disease Shark Shaggy dog story Common cold Milton H.

is this a lot i go out at the weekend at least one or two night if not im worried im over drinking example i stayed in sat night and drank full bottle of jp charnet wine to myself and had a chinese before it i went clubbing sunday night and had cans of corrs light before we got to the club i had two more bottles of corrs light and glasses of wine you know the wine you get in a pub or club the small bottles quater of a bottle i find i get so many black outs have arguments with my friend sometimes which the next morning seems so silly over and always the next day im so tired and moody and take it out on my mam i then feel guilty about it but cos im so tired i just want to sleep and be on my own i feel almost depressed the morning after i tryed to give up drink before but found it really boaring when im out and self consious im years old and only drink at the weekend i eat health all week and work out but at the weekend i cant stick to being healthy with years nursing experience i can tell you this is the beginning of a deadly vicious cycle we like to call alcoholism the fact that you are blacking out should be the hugest red flag for you alcoholism starts out small just like with you a drink or two here and there then you're drinking yourself drunk one night a week then it slowly progresses from there you were able to get yourself drunk on an entire bottle of wine at home you didn't even go anywhere this will become an easy habit for you if you continue the fact that you drink every single weekend and to the extent that you describe it won't be long before you will need a drink during the week as well just to curb your body's craving for it then before you know it you're getting drunk the minute you get home from work every night because your body can no longer take going hours w out alcohol being healthy all week won't make up for the amount of alcohol you've put your body through during the entire weekend your liver is on overdrive that whole time and barely has time to recoup before you attack it again all alcohol has to be filtered through your liver which causes it to die over time of excessive alcohol abuse it's called cirrosis or fatty liver this is when your healthy liver's tissue turns into fatty blubber and is basically useless and just so you know alcoholics aren't allowed a liver transplant then there's your kidneys to worry about alcohol is a diuretic which means it sucks the water out of your body that you need to maintain a healthy fluid level right blood levels electrolyte balance etc which causes you to produce more urine over working your kidneys i'm not telling you any of this to scare you it's the truth a drink once in a great while or maybe one party nite a month is ok but drinking to the point of blacking out downing an entire bottle of wine on your own in one night and drinking every weekend is putting you on the fast track to developing a habit you won't be able to kick w out great effort and more than likely not before you've done permanent damage to your health you have time to stop it b c you're young but you have to do it now  Breastfeeding Alcoholism Hypoglycemia Kidney Dialysis Cirrhosis Insulin EastEnders Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fasting Diabetes mellitus Cocaine Prostate cancer Caffeine Atkins Nutritional Approach Dieting Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Urinary incontinence Blood Wine Stomach cancer Alcoholics Anonymous Folic acid Glycogen storage disease type I Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Beer Nutrition Gout Shaggy dog story Tobacco smoking Social rule Liver Fancy rat Sake Oasis (band) Bong Sleep Stroke Vitamin C Diazepam Knots Landing Cancer Marathon (sport) First aid Soft drink National Football League Theory of conduct Ben Johnson (athlete) Rum Water Tea Hepatitis C Electrophysiology Michael Garibaldi Coeliac disease Traumatic brain injury Chronic fatigue syndrome Guinea pig Fugu Champagne (beverage) Clinical depression Diabetes insipidus Milk Diabetic ketoacidosis Decompression sickness Trainspotting (novel) Drug test Drag racing Humphrey Bogart Paracetamol Glucocorticoid Chlorpromazine Alcohol Organ transplant Bipolar disorder Omega-3 fatty acid Puberty Mickey Mantle Veganism Word of Wisdom Weight training Electrolyte International League Protein-energy malnutrition Moonshine Australian words Indianapolis 500 Psoriasis Vitamin Hamster One Tree Hill (TV series) Hyperthermia Pneumonia Obesity

is it best to pop water blisters or leave them alone i was breaking in some new sneakers today and did alot of walking at work i have some water blisters on the bottom of my toes ouch a blister is your body's way of making a perfect dressing the fluid underneath contains healing properties such as enzymes and cells it is a seal against infection and also provides some minor protection against further rubbing by keeping the area underneath moist like under a blister it allows for faster healing than if you pop it and allow a scab to form wound care experts use moist wound healing now the best thing you can do it to avoid more pressure until they heal if the fluid underneath becomes too much and is looks like it might pop or it is rubbing on something you can purchase a transparent film dressing at a pharmacy these are made by companies like smith and nephew or m for these purposes they are called names like tegaderm or opsite you can virtually leave them on place straight over the blister with the bubble intact until your body reabsorbs the fluid and the blister is gone good luck and ouch it hurts hey  Herpes simplex virus Hiking Wound Callus Wound healing phases Smallpox Shoe Ulcer Brewery Diving suit Domestic rabbit Group A streptococcal infection Aerial (dance move) Tattoo Diving Skin Bong Body piercing Eczema Hyperbaric oxygen therapy Scarification Psoriasis Herpes zoster First aid Virus Luck Hydrochloric acid Intravenous therapy Hip fracture Textile manufacturing Motor oil Breastfeeding Cell (biology) Carnivorous plant Casting HIV Naval mine Kidney Glycerin Lung Pressure point Skateboarding trick Lymphatic system Bubble Bobble Pneumonia Characters of Naruto Decompression sickness The Adventures of Pete & Pete Dialysis Medical prescription Equine conformation Diabetes mellitus Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Paragliding Burial The Invisibles Fast bowling Violin Stomach cancer Surveillance Cavitation Siphon CPU cache Osteoarthritis Fluid dynamics Strap-on dildo Vortex Sexually-transmitted infection Kitesurfing Professional wrestling holds Healing Earring Enzyme Swimming Water Beetle Bedsore Customs and etiquette of Japan Drowning Bone fracture Soap bubble Chiropractic Pointe shoes Dobermann Wild ARMs 2 Sauna Ice core Platypus Common cold Satchel Paige Gastric acid Church of Christ, Scientist Marching band Social rule Vacuum Coriolis effect Human sexual behavior Ovulation Bonnie Tyler Iron

spring vol number you're a what medical aesthetician kathleen green managing editor for the ooq download the pdf k you're a what from past issues michele taylor works in a hospital and patients in her charge sometimes fall asleep but she s not a nurse and doesn t administer anesthesia so as michele herself often must clarify she s not an anesthetist she s an aesthetician aestheticians are licensed skincare specialists they treat facial skin to maintain and improve its appearance medical aestheticians like michele work with patients whose skin or appearance is affected by trauma or medical procedure such as surgery in the integrative medicine program where she works michele also offers stress reduction and relaxation it s during these treatments that patients are most likely to drift off i do put people to sleep but not with anesthesia she says some people just get so relaxed they fall asleep anxiety reduction is a large part of michele s job because of where she works in a cleveland hospital s radiation oncology department cancer patients who call michele to schedule an appointment find out about the services available then michele asks them questions to help them identify their needs do they want relaxation to feel better about themselves some people start out not really knowing she says with chemo patients for example all they know is they ve lost their hair their eyebrows their eyelashes it can be very stressful for them patients who want to enhance their appearance spend about an hour with michele learning how to choose and apply appropriate makeup colors and products the products they start with are usually colorless i m teaching them how to take care of their skin says michele so cleansing and moisturizing are always first this is especially important instruction for patients undergoing treatments such as radiation which sometimes causes skin irritation next comes foundation michele shows patients how to choose products for their skin types and to select the best matches from a variety of colors then she applies foundation to one side of the face explaining technique as she goes the entire process color choice application technique explanation is repeated for the eyes cheeks and lips only after the patient is satisfied with the results even if it means removing the makeup and starting over are they duplicated on the other side of the face lastly michele applies finishing powder and suggests complementary colors for clothing in the basics of skincare and makeup application michele s job is similar to that of most other aestheticians but helping patients apply makeup after medical treatment presents special challenges she says for example chemotherapy patients must learn how to measure their natural browline so that they can draw eyebrows to replace the ones lost to treatment and hair that has fallen out sometimes grows back in a different color affecting the choices for makeup colors that patients might consider still michele leaves final decision making to each patient i make suggestions but i go with what people feel comfortable with she says i want them to feel healthy letting patients make their own decisions serves another purpose too an illness or injury can make people feel like they lose control says michele teaching them about makeup and skincare gives them some control over how they look and how they maintain their skin although women are the only ones who request makeovers they re not the only patients michele sees facials are popular with men who michele says are more concerned about their skin than many people realize and adults and children alike enjoy her stress reduction and relaxation treatments aestheticians and medical aestheticians jobs vary depending on where they work aestheticians are employed in places like beauty salons spas and specialty sections of department stores medical aestheticians also called paramedical aestheticians often work for licensed healthcare providers including offices of plastic surgeons and dermatologists according to the bureau of labor statistics there were about skin care specialists which includes aestheticians and medical aestheticians in they had median annual earnings of with medical aestheticians often earning more because she is employed in a hospital much of michele s work differs from that of other medical aestheticians duties of those who work in offices of plastic surgeons for example include providing pre and postoperative skincare treatment medical aestheticians under the supervision of a dermatologist may perform exfoliation or other procedures those who work in burn units might teach burn recovery patients how to apply makeup to conceal their injuries in fact it was michele s desire to work with burn victims that led her to a medical aesthetician career she worked in a hospital and knew she liked the challenge of caring for wounds then she saw a tv newsmagazine program that described medical aestheticians and mentioned a need for them michele began researching the occupation and enrolled in cosmetology school she earned a diploma in aesthetics took an exam administered by her home state of ohio and became licensed she also has earned several professional certifications related to her work training licensing certification and continuing education requirements for aestheticians differ by state aestheticians complete a program in skincare at an approved school usually one that is regulated by the state s board of cosmetology program quality varies so each student should investigate schools curriculums most aesthetician training is general specialties may require additional education or on the job training medical specialization for aestheticians often is defined by self direction prior to enrolling in the aesthetician program for example michele had taken some college level science courses she recommends biology and anatomy coursework for aspiring medical aestheticians and had worked in a medical setting she had planned to work with a plastic surgeon but while providing skincare services to radiation patients saw a need for medical aestheticians in cancer treatment michele was aware of an existing look good feel better group program for cancer patients sponsored by the american cancer society she developed the integrative medicine program which the hospital then created to provide patients with a one on one alternative to the group setting willingness to accept and design alternatives has been a plus for michele in her work if you do someone up and she looks great but she doesn t like it says michele you have to let it go and defer to her preferences you have to be able to take constructive criticism openness empathy and an ability to communicate are also important for medical aestheticians she says the biggest drawback to michele s job stems from the population she works with many of the people she sees are terminally ill a lot of my patients die so i have to work with that reality she says it s hard especially with the kids but michele is a firm believer in integrative medicine which suggests in part a link between patients health and their feelings about themselves the transformation from self perceived beast to beauty overwhelms some patients to the point of tears she says for michele knowing that what she does can positively impact their recovery their overall health and their sense of self makes it worthwhile top e mail ooqinfo bls gov last updated october page url http stats bls

i broke my arm and i'm worried i'm and about years ago i was riding my scooter and i fell i went to the hospital the next day and they said that i had a buckle break they put a splint on it and gave me a sling than they told me to ice it and go to an orthopedic doctor i did that but i think that they misdiagnosed my arm because they said that a buckle break takes about weeks to heal and i had a long arm cast on for around weeks and a short arm cast for around weeks do you think that they could have misdiagnosed my arm also i think that because it was misdiagnosed it could have been treated wrong because it took a long time to heal and my wrist seems to sprain alot more easily and it sometimes hurts what do you think they diagnosed you right they put the cast on you and put them on for longer periods of time to make sure the bone healed back into the right place it is normal after a fracture that the area will be weakened after that that is why you hurt that arm more easily now i broke both of my feet years ago and i can't wear high heel shoes any longer  Equine conformation Carpal tunnel syndrome Orthopedic surgery Shoe Bone fracture Hip fracture Stress fracture Professional wrestling holds Diving Bruise First aid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Paget's disease of bone Prostate cancer Traumatic brain injury Sling (weapon) Aerial (dance move) Sin City Final Fantasy magic EastEnders High-heeled shoe Kodocha Michael Garibaldi Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Osteoporosis Strike (attack) Casting Ceramics Kurt Angle Chiropractic Social rule Professional wrestling attacks Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Archery Coeliac disease Foot Fencing Swingout Flat feet The Curse of Fenric Volleyball Glossary of climbing terms Gears and Vehicles (Xenogears) Tenshinhan Jessica Lynch Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Podiatrist Harp Waking the Dragons Piccolo Junior Saga Stomach cancer Crucifixion Wound Mattress YuYu Hakusho Church of Christ, Scientist 1957 World Series Chair Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Medicine Warrior (World of Warcraft) Punch (strike) Childbirth Neighbours Migraine Osteogenesis imperfecta Single bullet theory Orthodontics Comfrey Pregnancy The Empty Child Majin Buu Saga Growth hormone treatment Skateboarding trick End of Han Dynasty Shaggy dog story Professional wrestling match types Parade (military) Traditional Chinese medicine Professional wrestling throws Bob Rae Shin splints Replacement joint Snowboard Urinary incontinence Pain Jackass: The Movie Knife Weapon Diving suit Eddie Guerrero Bryan Robson Wild ARMs 2 Horizontal bar Straitjacket The Family from One End Street Mario Weight training Diablo II Sydney Riot of 1879

stingy rash last saturday i wore some fairly tight jeans now i don't know if this has anything to do with it but throughout the day i became more and more uncomfortable when i took off my jeans later that night i noticed several large bumps on my stomach and left side i also found two little rows on my back they look a bit like bug bites but are really close together the patch on my tummy consists of about and the one on my side and the two rows on my back are just two bites each but right next to each other the thing about this rash is that it doesn't just itch it burns sometimes i'll get stinging pain with it like little needles poking right through the skin it's insane and nothing seems to help i've tried calamine lotion benadryl triple antibiotics alchohol wipes and aveeno anti itch all things that i've had good luck with in the past but not this time so i'm wondering what on earth could this be well it sounds like it could be shingles how old are you shingles is usually seen in older people and up but can be seen in younger adults and up if you lived in texas i would ask if you had red ants in your clothes but usually you feel them bite shingles produce a stinging pain and an itch and can become very bothersome this rash may be nothing serious but i suggest you see your physician if nothing you tried helped the pain then you will need something prescription strength if it is shingles you doctor will probably prescribe something to get rid of the shingles but will give you some pain medication to get you through until they are gone good luck hope it goes away soon  Psoriasis Scabies Eczema Stomach cancer Cephalexin Cellulitis Fecal incontinence Herpes zoster Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Lyme disease Allergy Rash Conjunctivitis Mosquito Spider Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Lupus erythematosus Chlorpromazine Marilyn Monroe Diving Sunburn Social rule Animal Crossing Conspiracy (TNG episode) Piccolo Junior Saga Tattoo Poker jargon Characters in the Smurfs Beetle in an Anthill Characters of Naruto Milton H.

for doctors is being a doctor anything like scrubs i dont think it is but if it is it'll be a plus out of all the medical shows including e r house and grey's anatomy i think that scrubs is actually the most like being a doctor especially a resident scrubs is focused on residency training well now i guess they're mostly new attendings and a lot of what happens is pretty close those other shows are way more far fetched with respect to the scope of what doctors do and practice on house the docs run labs the woman always with the micropipetter in hand run the mris go to patient's houses to look for clues we never do this grey's anatomy the surgeons roll into work with the sun up looking around a m no way and they have at lot more free time on that show to set up all the scandals and love triangles in real life they would be working scrubs docs always seem to be at a hospital or icu which isn't the case during residency lots of time is spent in outpatient clinics as well as far as the interaction with nurses and patients there are a lot of similarities keep in mind it's still a tv show i don't really know what you mean though by it being a plus it's hard work and that's not always conveyed through the show  Medicine Nurse Physician Scrubs (TV show) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Scrubs Strong Medicine General practitioner Hospital Medicare (Canada) Psychiatry Mental Health Act 1983 Publicly funded medicine Midwifery Psychiatric hospital Nursing Theory of conduct Stomach cancer Physical therapy Medical University of South Carolina Milton H.

what is the best way to lower blood pressure and cholesterol my dad would like to know please he has tried several prescribed meds but they make him feel ill any ideas hi djjd you say your dad feels ill from the prescription meds he gets from his doctor did his doctor just put him on pills immediately upon finding out he had high blood bp and cholesterol i ask because the first thing the highest majority of knowlegable gp's will try their oout on a low fat low cholesterol strict diet and if your dad is a smoker he should have been told to quit like yesterday also your dad should've been given a recommended excercise routine that the dr approves of well there are so many things that can be tried before trust me once doc's get a bp cholesterol patient on pills they are for life like luggage and the side effects can really make one feel very poorly like your dad did there is a fruit juice that is sold in most large grocery stores tesco asda etc that is awesome for these two maladies it is pomenegrate juice my fiancee' has high bp and high cholesterol and we have managed to keep him from not having to take pills and we have come very close to almost having to a few times btw the pomegrenate juice usually comes with one other added healthy juice like acai berries taste like blueberries and raspberry or it can be bought straight with just the pomegrenate juice he also takes ginko biloba times a week and drinks the actimel bacterial drinks they come usually in packs and are very very small bottles like the same amount of a medium sized shot glass also it sounds gross and i'm glad i don't have to drink it it's soya milk and he alternates each week from soya milk to rice milk actimel and he swears it tastes good we take a mt walk every night after dinner and on weekends we take our son out i e to the park for soccer practice we help out the rspca and are volunteer dog walkers etc my biggest suggestion is to try as many avenues as you can to keep your dad from having to stay on pills because he'll be on them for life good luck to you and your dad god bless  Milk Veganism Dieting Nutrition Vitasoy Chocolate Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cholesterol Wal-Mart Soy milk Breastfeeding Tesco Atkins Nutritional Approach Hypercholesterolemia Oral contraceptive Diabetes mellitus Antiretroviral drug Coronary heart disease Tobacco smoking Chronic fatigue syndrome Alcoholic beverage Urinary incontinence Migraine Dairy Antidepressant Dietary fiber Rum Prostate cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bong Cuisine of Denmark Folic acid Atherosclerosis Cheese Omega-3 fatty acid Wine Vegetarianism Medical prescription Food Stomach cancer Medical cannabis Vitamin C Coeliac disease Colorectal cancer Cider Alzheimer's disease Sildenafil Vitamin D Low density lipoprotein Cannabis (drug) Low-carbohydrate diet Tofu Organic food Tea Caffeine Insulin Obesity Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Fanta Diarrhea Breakfast Trans fat Kosher foods Bipolar disorder Medicine Clinical depression Soybean Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Gout Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Homeopathy The Coca-Cola Company Hamster Trailer Park Boys Guinea pig Social rule Friends Fecal incontinence Pharmaceutical company One Piece minor characters Ginkgo Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Yoghurt Jewish cuisine Humphrey Bogart Acne Egg (food)

health care i live in the us and i am looking for people who live in other countries and have a nhs or free medical care that could tell me about it and how it works honestly in canada health care isn't free we pay for it with our taxes overall we pay about the same as people in the us do for taxes our health care per person averages year in the us it's year the health insurance companies don't profit off the sick and old like they do in the us we are healthier and live longer with our less expensive government provided health care when i signed up for my doctor in canada i gave my health card number ever since then i haven't had to present it i can get an appointment within a week and i get a shot once a week in the clinic lab without a problem if i need to go to the er i can do that if i need a doctor appointment i can get one within a week there are walk in clinics around if i need service sooner but it isn't urgent i have unlimited health insurance that gets canceled only when i die with no limits because the federal government negotiates drug prices with the drug companies some drugs are significantly less expensive than they are in the us my doctor in canada is very successful whereas my doctor in pennsylvania is about to shut his office down because he can't afford to work there anymore with the reduction in medicare reimbursements he gets now your country's war in iraq is draining money from government funded health services and hurting the people it's supposed to be helping if someone told you that you would lose of your income today do you think you could continue as you are my doctor in pennsylvania is seriously considering coming to canada he can open his own office here and help a lot of people while making decent money hospital care is free of charge to the patients we all pay for it with our taxes doctor visits testing and home care is also provided without you having to pay for it yourself immunizations for everyone are paid for by the government we have it pretty good in canada if you're poor old a student etc where you wouldn't have decent health care in the us you would find that you have everything that everyone else has if you need an operation you might have to wait if you need something done now or you will die you will get it done today i can wait a few hours in the er while people spraying blood go first i can also wait to get a hernia fixed for a month or two so that car accident people can have their lives saved dental care orthodontics a medication are not paid for by the government they are usually covered by supplemental insurance if you have a full time job this insurance costs month for a family if you don't have supplimental insurance you would have to pay for dental orthodontics and medication by yourself when medication cost becomes a problem there are government programs to help you out after actually experiencing both systems i like the canadian system better i can get care here in the us i had the best care that could buy i was sick and we didn't have insurance when i came back to canada it turns out that i had asthma and anemia my doc in pa diagnosed me with asthma but he didn't do blood tests that found that i have anemia they were done in canada because it would have cost me hundreds of dollars please disregard the people who call universal health care communism they are indoctrinated by the health insurance companies in the us to believe that you have to pay exorbitant amounts of money to for profit companies to get decent health care all that money they charge to deny people care is used to pay billions of dollars in bonuses to upper management we don't have that problem in canada the government tries to keep the people healthy not a company trying to make profits off the sick our system isn't perfect we do have some problems we have a doctor shortage in some regions people have to wait to have non life threating conditions surgically corrected but the cons are nothing compared to the pros we have it pretty good with our health care system i'm willing to wait to get an operation because i know that nobody is being denied care for lack of insurance or inability to pay we don't have cleft palates left uncorrected i have seen people in pennsylvania with partially corrected cleft palates the us should be ashamed of that those people are not treated well by others because their families are poor and couldn't afford to have the baby child's face repaired before they went to school  Life insurance Pharmaceutical company Canada Health Act Medicare

is there a way to prevent warts i started getting a tiny wart here and there a few years back when i went through a stressful and depressing time in my marriage i never had a wart prior to this and i am in my late twenties i thought maybe it was because my immune system was down from everything going on they were so tiny it was hard to tell what they were until it was diagnosed i would just have a brownish spot smaller than the size of a pin rarely they would grow and i would have to have them frozen off by the derm well i have been laid off for several months and am under tremendous stress i am having an outbreak that is the worst i can recall it seems like they keep coming back bigger and stronger instead of having i have at least large ones i try filing them down using the liquid and i even bought dr scholls freeze off i would like to boost my immune system and prevent these from coming i am interviewing and am so self conscious they are now big enough where i can actually see the seeds ugh it is disgusting i feel less than human it isn't very attractive that's for sure i don't have insurance right now to go to a derm but believe me i will head there the day i get healthcare what can i do in the meantime i heard warts are a strain of hpv and that the vitamin lysene can prevent some strains of hpv would this work how can i fight this virus they are on my fingers i wash my hands multiple times a day but they aren't moist i used to think they only occurred in breaks of the skin but i am getting them on spots where it is unlikely to have a tear also how come if i get one on a certain spot on my finger another one in that same exact spot appears on the other hand it is so bizarre no there are some several hundred variations of the hpv virus it's more of a family than one specific virus it's just that they all cause warts some prefer certain body parts to others and the way the warts look can be different there really isn't any way to prevent them aside from the genital variety that will be blocked with a condom even then you can still get them in other spots in the area the over the counter preps work as well as anything the doctor uses even the freeze off is the same liquid nitrogen it will take a while to get them shifted off though anywhere up to a few months sometimes it works faster if you scrub the dead cells off before applying more but if you are patient it will still work and cheaper than the dermatologist as well you are quite human because the virus only attacks humans the varieties that attack animals don't affect us and vice versa some folks are just more susceptible to the viruses that's all other than attending to your overall health there isn't really anything you can take that will help much although stress can lower the immune system it wouldn't be a significant thing to explain warts you could certainly up your b complex vitamin intake as that's the one most depleated in stress but really just an ordinary multivitamin mineral supplement and a balanced diet will do well but otherwise just pick your favorite over the counter wart remover and plug away at them they will shift off with patience and daily treatment  Herpes simplex virus Human papillomavirus Multiple sclerosis Wart Acne Cancer Prostate cancer Psoriasis Cervical cancer Nutrition Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tocopherol Cytomegalovirus Folic acid Milk Homeopathy Chronic fatigue syndrome Common cold Vitamin C AIDS reappraisal Medicine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Eczema Stomach cancer Virus AIDS Carpal tunnel syndrome Autism Medical analysis of circumcision Rabies Alzheimer's disease Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Osteoporosis Smallpox HIV Sexually-transmitted infection Cryonics Breastfeeding Anemia Immune system Influenza Urinary incontinence Antiviral drug Veganism Molluscum contagiosum Traumatic brain injury Coeliac disease Zinc Dog Bipolar disorder Ebola Pneumonia HIV test Milton H.

why does my boyfriend twitch as he's falling asleep his limbs twitch but only as he's falling asleep and he doesn't know he's doing it as he's already half asleep it's normal and a lot of people do it it's because he is entering the first realm of sleep if you watch him i bet his eyes are even fluttering this is the realm of sleep where the muscles start to relax and where you would dream basically your body is asleep but your brain is still awake which is why if you were to talk to him he would still hear you some people get really bad with spasms me personally i find that my entire leg will jump and it normally startles me into waking up good luck but it is normal and nothing you can do to fix it  Out-of-body experience Sleep Narcolepsy Lucid dreaming Urinary incontinence Insomnia Dream Muscle Social rule Sleep paralysis Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Futurama (TV series - season 5) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Phoebe Halliwell Epilepsy The Amber Spyglass Scenes from a Memory Myoclonus Philosophical skepticism Caffeine Proprioception The Shining (film) Restless legs syndrome Characters of The Sandman Sleep disorder Shaggy dog story Orgasm Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Sleep debt Bedwetting Phantasms (TNG episode) Equine conformation Datalore (TNG episode) Physical strength Cat Electroencephalography The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Hansel und Gretel The Death Gate Cycle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Hypnosis Dreamlands Sin City Rapid eye movement Backstroke Aikido Conker's Bad Fur Day Avenue Q Suicide methods 50 First Dates Poliomyelitis The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters Cephalic disorder Diazepam Brigadoon Jam (TV series) Piccolo Junior Saga Sleep apnea Whale Oh My Goddess!

omg i have been eating aluminum is eating food chicken in my case that has been cooked in aluminum foil safe i hear that the foil could give off metal residue that could go to my brain and hasten the onset of dementia not sure if i am predisposed to this ailment but you never know are there any references out there that point to either safety or dangers of using this foil for most consumers the amount of aluminium absorbed into food from cooking utensils is unlikely to be harmful in recent years there has been concern about the possible role of aluminium in a number of neurological disorders scientists have found increased levels of aluminium in the brain tissues of some patients suffering from alzheimer's disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and parkinsonism dementia although hypotheses have been put forward suggesting that aluminium may be an important factor in these disorders so far there is insufficient evidence to say that aluminium is a cause the amount of aluminium in our diet will depend on its concentration in the foods we select the amounts of them we eat and their method of preparation when foods are cooked or stored in aluminium containers some of the aluminium may dissolve and be absorbed into the food acid foods such as fruit and vegetable juices tomatoes and sauerkraut tend to increase in aluminium content more than other foods but the extent of this depends on other factors such as cooking temperature length of contact time and even the amount of sugar present sugar reduces the amount of aluminium that is dissolved generally however the amount of aluminium consumed in this way is very small compared to that naturally present or that obtained from food additives foods such as some herbs and spices and tea leaves are naturally high in aluminium but because only small quantities are generally consumed the amount of aluminium obtained from these items will not be high if large amounts of these foods are consumed then the aluminium intake will be more substantial food additives which contain aluminium include the anticaking agents calcium aluminium silicate anticaking agent and sodium aluminosilicate anticaking agent and the baking powder ingredient sodium aluminium phosphate baking powders can be used in a wide range of products such as self raising flour biscuits cakes and other flour products when baking powder is used in these products the sodium aluminium phosphate in the powder does not have to be declared separately on the label some forms of synthetic colouring substances may add some aluminium to our diet the presence of the aluminium in these colours does not have to be declared on food labels overall the amount of aluminium in food whether naturally occurring or in the form of food additives is likely to be low compared to the amounts that can be obtained from consuming pharmaceutical products such as antacids buffered analgesics and anti diarrheoals hope this helps dont worry too much have a good one  Cookware and bakeware Coffee Sulfuric acid Tofu Carbon dioxide Veganism Hypoglycemia Bread Coeliac disease Tooth Food preservation Welding Sugar substitute Omega-3 fatty acid Dieting Hydrochloric acid Milk Foodborne illness Dairy Obesity Illegal drug trade Alum Sewage treatment Cocaine Plastic Breastfeeding Traumatic brain injury Clinical depression Urinary incontinence Vegetarianism Cannabis (drug) Flour Hamster Insulin Portland cement Turmeric Ammonia Tea Fire extinguisher Healthy eating Multiple sclerosis Acetic acid Sauerkraut Tobacco smoking Kashrut Iron Trans fat Alcoholic beverage Jewish cuisine Alcohol fuel Food additive Dementia Ecology Ramen Mercury (element) Titanium Soil pH Corrosion Chronic fatigue syndrome Magnesium Raw food diet Schizophrenia Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Water purification Parkinson's disease Brewery Monosodium glutamate Motor neurone disease Photosynthesis Methamphetamine Thimerosal Kosher foods Colorectal cancer Organic farming Nuclear power Sulfur Crohn's disease German cuisine Dietary fiber Cuisine of the Southern United States

quit smoking does anyone have any new creative interesting or sucessful tricks or ideas on how to quit smoking i've been smoking for abou years now and when my mom died at the age of from lung cancer though hers was not smoking related i promised her i would quit just recently i found out her mother has emphysethmia and my father is also a smoker for many years and is short of breath often he lives with me so it is tough when i decide to quit if he still smokes also i had a pe or pulmonary embolism blood clot in the lung in the past years that could've been fatal and i have a year old who i want to live a long healthy life for no i don't smoke around her plus i just don't enjoy smoking anymore b c of the smell the health risks it gives me headaches but the nicotine has got a strong hold on me please help if you can thank you first off i am an adult so i have been to school and gone through health classes that showed pictures of dieased lungs so obviously that didn't work do you know what is worse than looking at those pics seeing your own mom die from lung cancer and to tell the truth when i started smoking i didn't care about myself or my body thank you to the serious and non offensive people i am only human and i make mistakes too i am now trying to rectify that natalie someone as dim as u r should've been able to spell the word stupid since u probably hear it often anyway try growing up in a house in which your parents smoke and make it seem like it's no big deal i know your dilemma i too was a heavy smoker if you have only been smoking for years it might be easier than you think i smoked years i buried parents a sister all of whom i miss terribly within the last yrs all from cancer i have no idea if any of them were cancer related the possibility is there as well as the probability emphysema usually is smoke related but not always and it often runs in families i'm an rn i know all the risks involved but when your in a stress related job you can sure come up with alot of reasons why you need to keep smoking what ever reason others use to keep going to the store buying another pack or carton and lighting up is obvious it's an addiction period the newest med is chunix sp has shown excellent results if you treat smoking like the addiction it is you will succeed eventually the nicotine stays in the body for approximately days depending on how heavy a smoker you are but that's only the physical addiction after that you will have to contend with the psychological aspect of the addiction but mentally it sounds like you're way there great i also used nicorette gum it helps sit your dad down encourage him to quit with you tell him how important it is to you that his health does not deteriate any more than it has shortness of breath tell him if he wants to continue to smoke he'll have to do it outside this is a must if you continue to let him smoke around you you are setting yourself up for failure next do all your routines different if it's your habit to get up in the am light up get up shower instead or go for a walk read a book anything different from the norm remember the aa mantra one day at a time i also recommend you go to www quitassistonline com they have lots of great info as well as chat rooms where you can talk to others online going thru the same thing there's alot of free help out there good luck  Cancer Cigarette Pneumonia Prostate cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Breastfeeding Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Theory of conduct Cannabis (drug) Cigar Addiction Tobacco Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Divorce Social rule Drug abuse Medicine Arguments for and against drug prohibition Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cigarette Smoking Man Babe Ruth Smoking pipe EastEnders Stroke Tocopherol Milton H.

do we sometimes suffer with illness that we can't explain last night i had a huge crushing pain around my rib cage during the course of the next two hours the pain spread to every joint and muscle in my body until i was literally unable to move freezing cold and shivering within an hour the sensation began to ease and i slept for several hours i woke up this morning a little stiff and sore in places but much better this evening i'm almost back to i cannot explain what i went through or why i went through it because i am not unwell at the moment but i do wonder if our bodies ocassionally go through these inexplicable episodes and are working a lot harder than we ever give them credit for no i don't believe it was a heart attack as my heart was beating quite normally and happily yes it did cross my mind in the early stages i think it was some sort of virus that my body simply fought incredible awww sweetie feel better soon you know im suffering archieitus it casues fevers and unexplained rumblings where there should be no rumblings feel better xxxxx  Glen Jacobs First aid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Equine conformation Chronic fatigue syndrome Leon White Thermoregulation Group A streptococcal infection Insomnia The Amber Spyglass Futurama (TV series - season 5) Paul Levesque Professional wrestling match types Fibromyalgia Sin City Out-of-body experience Shaggy dog story Oh My Goddess!

what is it about getting a massage that relaxes us i used to train at the gym for up to hours really agressively i stopped for about years and just the other day i trained again my approach was just as agressive as if i never stopped but with less weights and i only lasted hour mins the day after i was so sore i could bareley get out of bed and i could barely pick up a glass of water i could not even lift a book up to read the day after that i went for a massage the massues stood on me and applied a lot of pressure all over my body after the massage i was completely relaxed and only my arms are slightly sore what exactly is it about a massage that relaxes us is it the pressure applied to our bodies once the pressure is applied it's really uncomfortable but once it's released there is releif or is it the kneading of the muscles that causes releif btw i did not get a happy ending from the massues but i did get some from my girl after i went to the gym and the day before i went to the massues and that didn't releive any of my back and neck soreness besides the relief of relaxing tight muscles massage causes the release of endorphins into the system if you don't know what endorphins are they are the body's natural pain killer actually similar to morphine in composition so obviously you are more wonderfully relaxed when that happens and i hate it when people automatically have to ask about happy endings with massage it really is an insult to professional therapists  Massage Repetitive strain injury Professional wrestling holds Reflexology Equine conformation Weight training Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Physical therapy Endorphin Myocardial infarction Sento First aid Professional wrestling throws Milton H.
