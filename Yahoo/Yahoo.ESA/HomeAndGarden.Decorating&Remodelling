why is the new grout cracking and coming up i have inch ceramic tiles with probably gaps in the foyer hallway i have cementboard right under the tiles and then two layers of plywood underneath that i have used unsanded grout that says polymer enhanced portland cement grout for grouting small tile joints up to wide almost everything ended up fine and satisfactory except for a few lines where it just cracked and came up after vacuuming the grout also can be easily pushed out with hardly any pressure from your finger so it can't be because of the vacuum i have probably tried to re do it at least times but it keeps cracking and coming up when i re do the grout i try to clean out all the old grout and vacuum it out i even tried to use mineral spirits to clean it and then re do it i have to give credit to home depot though because i called them up to ask them what i was doing wrong and they actually pointed out that i should be letting the grout mixture sit for about minutes before working it in the lines i was not doing that initially and it says on the package to do that i must have not read that the last two times i have also tried to pack the grout into the lines as much as possible as hd also recommended that as well however that still has not solved my problem it is a high traffic area and we just do not have the time to keep people from walking near the area i did try to do it though when everyone was asleep and the first time anyone would have come through the area was at least four hours later would this be an issue i need to get this done as i want to seal the whole grout lines is the tile underlayment installed in a bed of fresh thinset where the cement board joints taped with fiberglas tape what is the size of the floor joists what is the style of the floor joists what is the spacing of the floor joists what is the unsupported span of the floor joists what type of tile was used answers yes the tile underlayment is in a bed of fresh thinset yes on the fiberglass tape x on the size and style of the joists approx on the spacing of the joists there is no unsupported span of the joists if i am understanding the question correctly porcelain tile was used i have already been told plenty of times the consistency to mix it everyone says peanut butter i have tried it also thinner and thicker i don't see how adding something to harden it would make a difference it hardens just fine it is just not adhering properly i am trying right now what john k has suggested if it doesn't work i will get sanded grout nope i am not adding water near the end of the job i already know not to do that i would never tell you how to do your install it sounds like you have to use a sanded grout it will not push out with your finger it should solve your problem  Seismic retrofit Drill bit Tile Casting Mattress Fiberglass Drywall Concrete Asbestos Pottery Basement Brewery Roof Opportunity rover Dairy Welding Vacuum tube Thermal power station Bong Light-frame construction Dundas Square Polyurethane Portland cement Hamster Violin Radio controlled airplane Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Printed circuit board Japanese tea ceremony Glossary of climbing terms Pavement (material) Coffee Electrical wiring Pebble bed reactor Textile manufacturing Gramophone record Stairway Hard disk Tofu Double bass Vacuum Steel Wood Equine conformation Volleyball Floppy disk STS-114 Menstrual cup Sento Ra (board game) Brazing Platform framing Soldering Spark plug Illegal drug trade Strap-on dildo Dialysis Timber framing San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Flood geology Sedimentary rock ZX Spectrum Knife Transformer Two-stroke cycle Rail tracks DVD GLOCK Aerial (dance move) Windows XP Leaf Ultraviolet Harp Glacier Halting problem Upholstery Tooth Social rule Architecture of the California missions Windows 2000 Straw-bale construction Luminiferous aether Light-emitting diode Apollo 8 MP3 Massage The Curse of Fenric
