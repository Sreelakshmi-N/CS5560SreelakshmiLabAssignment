could i die with this bicuspid aortic valve disease i asked earlier what it was now i know what it is is it possible to die or have any complications what so ever with it and only the problem with bicuspid valves is that they have a tendency to become calcified and fibrotic hard and thickened over time if you are not seen regularly by a cardiologist and the valve becomes very calcified it can make it difficult for your heart to get enough blood flow out to your body think of a showerhead with the nozzles clogged leading to symptoms of chest pain fainting spells or heart failure on the flipside some people with bicuspid aortic valves will have more trouble with valve leakiness than with a tight valve a leaky valve makes your heart work extra hard to get the same amount of blood out to your body as a heart without any leaky valves over time this can overwork your heart and make it start to fail third a few people with bicuspid aortic valves have abnormalities with their aortas as well and can develop aneurysms or narrowings that need to be addressed now i will say this don't panic bicuspid aortic valves are actually quite common and people who live with them usually live normal lifespans the above complications tend to be seen in people who do not get regular follow up and let things progress until they are really bad before they go to their doctor unfortunately the fact is that most patients with bicuspid aortic valves will require surgery during their lifetime for some with more deformed valves intervention is required in childhood or adulthood however the majority have relatively normal valve function and remain undiagnosed until late in adulthood when the valve becomes stiff it is impossible to predict when you will need surgery to replace your valve but the most important thing is to follow up with your cardiologist on a regular basis you need to know that a cardiologist will need to monitor you with echocardiograms to help determine if and when you need to have anything done don't worry though as long as you keep seeing a cardiologist who understands bicuspid aortic disease you should be ok surgery is very safe these days and you can generally expect a long and healthy life even after having your valve replaced hope that helps good luck  Atrial septal defect Aortic valve stenosis Heart valve Aortic insufficiency Marfan syndrome Myocardial infarction Heart sounds Heart Stroke Hypertension Blood pressure Mitral regurgitation Atheroma Atherosclerosis Pneumonia Prostate cancer Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Sickle-cell disease Mitral stenosis Atrial fibrillation Aortic aneurysm Medicine Diabetes mellitus Aneurysm Traumatic brain injury Cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mitral valve prolapse Coronary catheterization Aorta Chronic fatigue syndrome Dialysis Heyde's syndrome Hypoglycemia Multiple sclerosis Stomach cancer Physical examination Cardiovascular disease Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cephalic disorder Anorexia nervosa Syringomyelia Coronary heart disease Bipolar disorder Urinary incontinence Cirrhosis Echocardiography Adult attention-deficit disorder Cardiac stress test Coronary circulation Folic acid Penis Malaria Von Willebrand disease Cardiothoracic surgery Anemia Diabetic neuropathy Electrophysiology Anxiety Mesothelioma Growth hormone treatment Autism Rheumatic fever Childbirth Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Angioplasty Circulatory system Rheumatoid arthritis Polycystic kidney disease Syphilis Rebreather Gastroesophageal reflux disease Organ transplant Panic attack Artery Atkins Nutritional Approach Colorectal cancer Thermal power station Osteoarthritis Radiation therapy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Diabetic retinopathy Tocopherol Leukemia Clinical depression Crohn's disease

if you have low blood pressure can you still play sports all the time and stuff sevynn marie to be honest most people who have been told that they have a low blood pressure actually have a blood pressure that is normal for them one thing to remember is that blood pressures increase as people get older in healthy young individuals it is not uncommon to see systolic blood pressures that's the top number less than sometimes even into the s i've seen healthy young women with perfectly good blood pressures of say that worry about their low blood pressure if you feel fine and don't suffer from light headedness or excessive fatigue then your blood pressure is most likely adequate for you there are people who run low blood pressures and complain of fainting or lightheadedness when they stand in these cases there is potential benefit in giving meds to increase the blood pressure so the first question is do you really have low blood pressure or do you have blood pressure that might be low for a year old man but is perfectly fine for you if you are not suffering from fainting lightheadedness or excess fatigue then there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to play sports based on your blood pressure in fact blood pressure normally increases during exercise it will not however increase your blood pressure over the long term as the other answerer suggests hope that helps feel free to message me with more info if you like good luck to you  Blood pressure Chronic fatigue syndrome Equine conformation Pneumonia Weight training Dieting Hypertension Hypoglycemia Theory of conduct Intracranial pressure Breastfeeding Social rule Decompression sickness Atkins Nutritional Approach Traumatic brain injury Human height Prostate cancer Sleep apnea Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Exercise Cardiac arrhythmia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Carburetor Dehydration Stroke Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Psoriasis Myocardial infarction Cardiac cycle Androgen insensitivity syndrome Urinary incontinence Cancer Nutrition Pulse Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Multiple sclerosis Sickle-cell disease Anorexia nervosa Health insurance Asthma American Red Cross Mitral regurgitation Folic acid Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Knife Atherosclerosis Insulin Baldness Atrial fibrillation Dialysis Anemia Physical examination Aortic insufficiency Paracetamol Coronary heart disease Malaria Balance disorder Panic attack Dyslexia Heart Marathon (sport) Duesberg hypothesis Veganism Charles Darwin's illness Coeliac disease Clinical depression Infantilism Cardiac stress test Aortic dissection Diabetes mellitus Colorectal cancer Microeconomics Human adaptation to space Tai Chi Chuan Tocopherol Herpes simplex virus Alcoholism Stomach cancer Physical attractiveness Marie Antoinette Blood atonement Coffee Word of Wisdom Dissociative identity disorder Acute respiratory distress syndrome First aid Doxepin Supply-side economics Anxiety Turbocharger Public good Obstetrics Electrophysiology Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS

i would like a list of all fatty foods what are they i have fatty liver if you would like to educate yourself not only about foods that are high in fat but which are the good fats and which are the bad fats i would check out the american heart association's website http www americanheart org presenter jhtml identifier while it is a good idea for everybody to make improvements in their diet however i have to agree with 'pharma' that fatty liver is not directly related to how much fatty food you eat at the same time excessive alcohol is only one of many causes of a fatty liver to assume that alcohol is the reason for your condition would be a mistake two very common reasons for non alcoholic fatty liver disease or nafld in the united states are diabetes and obesity however it can also be caused by a variety of medications this is something you should explore with your doctor only with a complete history and physical exam can a physician best advise you on how to manage the problem for now general measures such as avoiding alcohol losing weight and making sure that your blood pressure and cholesterol are well managed should do it while fatty foods don't directly cause a fatty liver improving you diet will certainly improve some of the risk factors that are more directly related to the fatty liver talk to your doctor and see if any of your meds could be responsible see if he thinks you should be screened for diabetes hope you find that helpful good luck to you  Hypoglycemia Atkins Nutritional Approach Diabetes mellitus Obesity Dieting Omega-3 fatty acid Hypertension Cirrhosis Nutrition Atherosclerosis Insulin Coeliac disease Trans fat Alcoholism Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Cholesterol Cardiovascular disease Folic acid Cancer Medicine Hypercholesterolemia Hepatitis Vegetarianism Breastfeeding Veganism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Multiple sclerosis Stomach cancer Crohn's disease Vitamin Hyperglycemia Colorectal cancer Tocopherol Low-carbohydrate diet Glycogen storage disease type I Aspartame Oily fish Angina Fatty acid Glycemic index Growth hormone treatment Chronic fatigue syndrome Alzheimer's disease Pneumonia Caffeine Anorexia nervosa Gastroesophageal reflux disease Fecal incontinence Low density lipoprotein Acne Glucocorticoid Paracetamol Binge eating disorder Psoriasis Hedgehog Osteoarthritis Exercise Myocardial infarction Growth hormone Health insurance Polycystic ovary syndrome Gout Bipolar disorder Clinical depression Cystic fibrosis Blood pressure Obstetrics Adipose tissue Vegetarian nutrition Gastroparesis Urinary incontinence Soft drink Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis Super Size Me Vitamin D Traumatic brain injury Weight training Margarine Migraine Malaria Weight loss Anemia Insulin resistance Chlorpromazine Macular degeneration Saturated fat

what does this mean in dumb terms basically i have a heart condition and im and the doctor told me i have bicuspid aortic valve disease and when i asked him what is that he ignored me ive tried looking on the internet and found only smart things pretty much can anyone explain to me what it is what can happen to me and am i likey to have a heart attack hi and only the first thing you should know is that a bicuspid aortic valve is the most common form of congenital heart defect affecting up to of the population there is also a genetic component of patients with bicuspid aortic valves have other family members with the same thing thus we generally recommend that first degree relatives of people with bicuspid aortic valves get screening echocardiograms normally the aortic valve is made up of three separate leaflets that form what looks like a mercedes benz symbol when they come together in a bicuspid aortic valve there is incomplete separation of two of the three leaflets hence the term bicuspid or two leaflets the problem is that these abnormal valves have a tendency to become calcified and fibrotic hard and thickened over time unfortunately the fact is that most patients with bicuspid aortic valves will require surgery during their lifetime for some with more deformed valves intervention is required in childhood or adulthood however the majority have relatively normal valve function and remain undiagnosed until late in adulthood when the valve becomes stiff it is impossible to predict when you will need surgery to replace your valve but the most important thing is to follow up with your cardiologist on a regular basis you need to know that a cardiologist will need to monitor you with echocardiograms because patients with bicuspid aortic valve are not only at risk for developing a stiff aortic valve but can develop a severely leaky aortic valve an enlarged aorta and even dissection in the worst cases the decision to take you to surgery is not based on symptoms alone although those are definitely important as well your doctor will watch the gradient across the valve the amount of valve leakiness and the size of your aorta if the valve is very leaky and your heart function is starting to suffer surgery is generally recommended if the aortic root is getting bigger to the point where there is a risk of aortic dissection surgery is generally recommended if the gradient becomes severe we consider this to be a mean gradient of mmhg or more and you have symptoms sugery is generally recommended the question of whether to recommend surgery in an asymptomatic patient with severe aortic stenosis is more controversial and should be discussed with your cardiologist don't worry though as long as you keep seeing a cardiologist who understands bicuspid aortic disease you should be ok surgery is very safe these days and you can generally expect a long and healthy life even after having your valve replaced hope that helps good luck  Prostate cancer Myocardial infarction Heart sounds Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Atherosclerosis Heart Cancer Multiple sclerosis Cephalic disorder Sickle-cell disease Androgen insensitivity syndrome Intersex surgery Medicine Atheroma Bipolar disorder Mitral valve prolapse Folic acid Cardiovascular disease Diabetes mellitus Aneurysm Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Blood pressure Osteoarthritis Heyde's syndrome Pneumonia Cerebral palsy Chronic fatigue syndrome Von Willebrand disease Syringomyelia Crohn's disease Coeliac disease History of intersex surgery Endocarditis Anorexia nervosa Stomach cancer Aorta Anemia Colorectal cancer Cystic fibrosis Cardiac stress test Computed tomography Adult attention-deficit disorder Ulcerative colitis Autism Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Polycystic kidney disease Coronary heart disease Coronary catheterization Malaria Lupus erythematosus Magnetic resonance imaging Cardiothoracic surgery Dialysis Asthma Physical examination Tuberous sclerosis Noonan syndrome Cytomegalovirus Syphilis Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Sex assignment Mesothelioma Congenital disorder Growth hormone deficiency Transsexuality Angioplasty Breast cancer Psoriasis Rheumatoid arthritis Shock Infantilism Haemochromatosis Parkinson's disease Clinical depression Epilepsy

does insurance cover blood pressure monitors maybe it's a dumb question but honestly i don't know and this year is the first year when i got an insurance i don't know to many people that have home blood pressure monitors and if your bp is only i don't think you'll get a prescription from your doctor the is perfectly fine and the is only slightly elevated which can be caused by stress or caffeine or pain i would stop worrying so much about it honestly but if you want to stress over such a minor elevation ebay has blood pressure monitors for to although i really don't think they give you a reliable reading every time you are better off buying a cheap stethoscope and cuff and learning to take your own bp it's very easy to do put the cuff on feel for the artery that runs along the inside of your arm and place the stethocope there turn the valve on the cuff all the way clockwise and pump up the cuff they say to but should be fine for you slowly turn the valve on the cuff counterclockwise so that the needle drops about mmhg a second you'll get the hang of how fast to release the air when you first hear your heartbeat that number is your systolic pressure and when it fades to the point you no longer hear it that is your diastolic and presto your doctor can show you how to use it as well and they make bp cuffs with the stethoscope built in so that it's easier to do good luck and take a breath d  Hypertension Sphygmomanometer Heart sounds Aortic valve stenosis Cardiac cycle Myocardial infarction Heart Aortic insufficiency Atrial septal defect Artery Carburetor Circulatory system Cardiology Physical examination Intravenous therapy Obstetrics Diving regulator Mitral regurgitation Decompression sickness Aortic dissection Stethoscope Dialysis Thermal power station Professional wrestling holds Equine conformation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence Blood vessel Shock Theory of conduct Angina Mitral stenosis Prostate cancer COX-2 inhibitor Scuba set Coronary circulation Breathing gas Internal ballistics Fecal incontinence Childbirth Liquid breathing Coronary catheterization Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Heart valve Humerus Humphrey Bogart Diesel engine Atherosclerosis Diving cylinder Anxiety Siphon First aid Carbon dioxide Brewery Diabetes mellitus Elbow bondage Team Fortress Classic Diving suit Sleep apnea Exercise Milton H.

congenital heart defect atrial septal defect which method is better in detecting or affirming the presence of a congenital heart defect especially the atrial septal defect is it mri or ecg thank you what if compare mri with echocardiogram an ecg alone is of limited value in detecting or affirming the presence of a congenital heart defect while some heart defects including primum and secunding asds are associated with specific ecg findings ecgs are neither sensitive nor specific enough for a doctor to rely on them alone mri provides very high resolution images of the cardiac anatomy and done properly is probably the best imaging study that we have at the present time to detect the presence of congenital heart lesions the problem is that mri is very expensive and is therefore not really considered to be a first line imaging study for many congenital heart defects an echocardiogram can provide all the necessary information in those situations mri is overkill mri is almost never inferior to echocardiograms though unless you consider patients who have pacemakers or icds and are therefore not always able to have mri imaging hope that answers your question  Cardiology Electrocardiogram Magnetic resonance imaging Aortic dissection Mitral regurgitation Ventricular septal defect Cardiac stress test Myocardial infarction Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Turner syndrome Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Congenital disorder Echocardiography Atrial fibrillation Congenital heart defect Cardiac arrhythmia Long QT syndrome Functional magnetic resonance imaging Cephalic disorder Antiarrhythmic agent Computed tomography Hypoglycemia Heart rate Noonan syndrome Spina bifida Medicine Multiple sclerosis Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome Radiology Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Defibrillator Cardiac arrest Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Breast cancer Cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures Estimation theory Atherosclerosis Obstetrics Malignant melanoma History of brain imaging Angina Positron emission tomography Brain tumor Atheroma Syringomyelia Troponin Magnetoencephalography Chest pain X-ray Growth hormone treatment Fetus Emergency department Amiodarone Coronary circulation Cardiac surgery Flecainide Cancer Bone marrow transplant Cardiac cycle Mitral stenosis Septic arthritis Appeal MMR vaccine AIDS reappraisal Terri Schiavo Patent ductus arteriosus Cardiac pacemaker Cerebellum DiGeorge syndrome Bradycardia Doppler effect Mental imagery Prolactinoma Tocopherol Myasthenia gravis History of intersex surgery Electroencephalography Hyperkalemia Medicare (Canada) Software testing Optic nerve Medical analysis of circumcision Incest taboo Action potential Endometriosis

any info appreciated been in hospital twice regarding s v t due to see consultant on thurday for test results and for him to tell me if i need an operation i know what s v t is but im a little worried anybody else been through the same paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia psvt is a rapid heart rate which occurs from time to time paroxysmal psvt starts with events taking place above the ventricles symptoms can come on suddenly and may go away without treatment they can last a few minutes or as long as days the rapid beating of the heart during svt can make the heart a less effective pump so that the body's organs do not receive enough blood to work normally the following symptoms are typical with a rapid pulse of beats per minute palpitations the sensation of the heart racing fluttering or pounding strongly in the chest or the carotid arteries dizziness or light headedness near faint or fainting shortness of breath anxiety chest pain or sensation of tightness weakness in legs a special procedure called radiofrequency ablation rfa has been developed as an alternative to medication to treat many patients with svt during this procedure special plastic tubes called catheters are inserted into a vein into the upper leg groin area and are advanced to the heart using a fluoroscope the catheters are used to record electrical signals from inside the heart they can locate precisely the site from which the svt originates radio waves called radiofrequency energy are delivered at the tip of this catheter to the precise location of the svt creating a small coagulation of the tissue approximately mm in diameter the procedure has a to chance of successfully treating the svt so that it does not recur or require medication there is approximately a chance that the svt will recur usually within the first to months rfa can carry the risks described below less than risk of serious or life threatening complications less than risk of damage to the normal conduction system bleeding bruising or infection at catheter insertion site damage to the heart lungs blood vessels or nerves blood clots to the lungs need for electrical shock to the chest rashes allergic reactions adverse effects of sedatives or anesthetic agents such as respiratory depression requiring insertion of a breathing tube please see the web pages for more details on svt and rfa  Aortic dissection Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Panic attack Insulin Heart Pulmonary embolism Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Anxiety Medicine Lung Coronary catheterization Intracranial pressure Epidural Hypoglycemia Obstetrics Chlorpromazine Bone marrow transplant Childbirth Local anesthesia Blood pressure Leukemia Cancer Sleep apnea Atheroma Diabetes mellitus Penis Decompression sickness Aneurysm Group A streptococcal infection Carbon dioxide Tobacco smoking Aspergillosis Cocaine Mesothelioma Coeliac disease Mobile phone radiation and health Needle aspiration biopsy Flecainide Pneumothorax Syringomyelia Hip fracture Radiosurgery Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Magnetic resonance imaging Diabetic neuropathy Gastroparesis Opioid Aspartame Pulmonary hypertension Chronic fatigue syndrome Paracetamol Cephalic disorder Bipolar disorder Cystic fibrosis Apoplexy Gastroesophageal reflux disease Mitral regurgitation Air embolism Clinical depression Drowning Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Interventional radiology Hypertension Radiation therapy X-ray Allergy Trazodone Tourniquet

about coronary artery abnormality happens to adults with tof lately i accepted my cardiologist's suggestion to have a cath test it was simply a test at first while the procedure going doctors came over and told me that i might have to get angioplasity the result is unknown but one of my coronary arteries is almost invissible i often feel pain in my chest is it dangerous unfortunately my problem with coronary artery is also congenital which is invissible rather than blockage according to my cardiologist said there is only one coronary artery working don't know where is the other one it is difficult to answer your question without more information tetralogy of fallot was once a condition in which patients were rarely expected to reach adulthood now with the advances that have been made in the field of congenital heart disease individuals with tetralogy of fallot are living long enough to develop common adult problems including coronary artery disease just because someone has tof does not mean that they can't acquire coronary disease during their adult life i have had a couple of adult tof patients who have undergone coronary stenting for significant coronary disease blockages in your coronary artery could certainly result in chest pain but all chest pain is not necessarily due to coronary disease it is up to your cardiologist to determine whether the blockages they see are significant enough to warrant angioplasty also without knowing what your doctors saw on your cath it is difficult to say whether your condition is serious or not one thing that i would strongly advise you of is to make sure that you are followed by a cardiologist who is well informed about the care of adults with congenital heart disease adults with repaired or unrepaired tof can have many issues that are not typical of the usual cardiac patient who has heart failure or coronary disease good luck to you hope that helps  Coronary heart disease Aortic dissection Coronary catheterization Angioplasty Atherosclerosis Angina Turner syndrome Cardiac stress test Folic acid Cardiovascular disease Stroke Heart Hypoglycemia Tocopherol Medicine Ventricular fibrillation Traumatic brain injury Pneumonia Intravascular ultrasound Tetralogy of Fallot Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cholesterol Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Blood pressure Emergency department Diabetes mellitus Cardiac arrhythmia Chest pain Ischaemic heart disease Obstetrics Stem cell Mitral regurgitation Hypertension Coronary circulation Asthma Prostate cancer Computed tomography Physical examination Congenital disorder Growth hormone treatment Stomach cancer Cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures Kawasaki disease Lung cancer Aortic valve stenosis Cytomegalovirus Ren__ Favaloro Congenital heart defect Multiple sclerosis Acupuncture Atkins Nutritional Approach Cardiac arrest Cerebral palsy Sickle-cell disease Mesothelioma Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Acne Autism Cystic fibrosis History of intersex surgery Clomipramine Intersex surgery Cardiac surgery Breast Kidney Abortion debate Pulmonary hypertension Cancer Heart rate Philips Cardiothoracic surgery Acute respiratory distress syndrome Circulatory system Androgen insensitivity syndrome Prayer Hearing impairment Infantilism Addiction Adult attention-deficit disorder Propranolol Growth hormone deficiency Crohn's disease Anorexia nervosa Contract Diabetic neuropathy Syringomyelia X-ray

my heart suddenly starts to beat faster but then it goes back to normal with no more symptoms i know i have to go to the doctor but i'm kinda sacared and don't want to wait to get to him to have at least an idea of what's happening i don't eat a lot of greasy foods since i don't go to fastfoods or eat any red meat but i do eat a lot sweet foods i am a bit overweight but not obese it's like pounds overweight and i'm years old i don't excercise much but i am not completely sedentary since i dance but just for a few monts september november and january april my grandmother did suffer from taquichardies but i don't know of anyone else suffering from any other heart disease in my family i am a completely healthy person who has never suffered from anything and doesn't get sick often what happens is it beats fast for like seconds and then it goes back to normal i don't feel dizzy or with blurred sight or any other symptom except for the beating of my heart in my chest which is really uncomfortable your grandma with tachycardia could have been brought on by anything and is not a disease in and of itself tachycardia simply means your heart is beating bpm beats per minute is the normal heart rate a heart rate should be fairly consistent with exceptions of chemical alterations stress and physical exertion any frequent deviation from a regular pattern should be followed up with a doctor immediately where they can do tests to see what is going on simple tests such as an ekg show the electrical pulses of the heart and allow the doctor to visualize the cycle of the heart beat and look for any blocks or electrical irregularities an echo cardiogram gives the doctor a two dimensional view of the flow of the blood and lets the doctor know how much of the blood is being pumped out of the heart and the direction a stress test can be helpful as well if there is a coronary artery blockage this can either be done with monitored exercise or chemically simple blood tests can detect electrolyte imbalances as you can see there are many things a doctor can do to check on the function of your heart if this is something that has happened more than once and there was nothing to trigger them go see a doctor dan s the answer above is very wrong and for your sake and health please disregard him i dont care if i get best answer but maybe the best thing to do is talk to your doctor wrong information on here can really do a lot of damage also tachycardia is not the same as an irregular heart beat disregard all that said that as well regular vs irregular simply is determining the length of time between electrical impulses of your heart this is usually deciphered with and ekg and they measure the time between your qrs complexes tachycardia is simply a fast heart heart rate and can be regular sinus tachycardia or irregular which can come in various forms  Heart rate Tachycardia Chronic fatigue syndrome Hypertension Atrial septal defect Prostate cancer Coronary heart disease Diabetes mellitus Traumatic brain injury Heart Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Atherosclerosis Stroke Cardiovascular disease Angina Ventricular fibrillation Cardiology Atrial fibrillation Anorexia nervosa Coeliac disease Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Blood pressure Physical examination Cancer Pulse Tocopherol Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Atrial flutter Asthma Action potential Nutrition Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Obesity Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator First aid Flecainide Panic attack Clinical depression Cardiac arrest Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures Anxiety Tobacco smoking CPU cache Cirrhosis Equine conformation Insulin Multiple sclerosis Bipolar disorder Atheroma Bradycardia Sleep apnea Pneumonia Decompression sickness Propranolol Circulatory system Chlorpromazine Folic acid Time signature Exercise Antiarrhythmic agent Heartworm Kidney Balance disorder Theory of conduct Dieting Maprotiline Medicine Cholesterol Milton H.

what can you do to prevent bad circulation there's different types of circulation so prevention is different for each one arterial or oxygenated blood bright red blood that leaves the heart and travels throughout the body circulation can be affected by high levels of cholesterol or obesity or even genetics cholesterol fat can line the walls of arteries and some people are prone to a hardening of arterial walls so for that healthy diets monitoring your cholesterol and other labwork at least once a year venous circulation de oxygenated blood much darker in color returns to the heart and is circulated through the lungs to get more oxygen is totally different venous blood has almost no pressure to keep it moving veins rely on tiny valves that open and close to pump the blood back to the heart the valves depend on muscle contractions to work so people that stand for long periods or aren't active are at risk of developing venous circulation problems for that high quality support stockings or hose for those that stand for long periods like teachers or grocery cashiers and even flexing your feet while sitting at a desk will help this is a really complicated question the best person to ask is your physician there's lots of good information on the internet these days as well just always check with your doc before making any major changes in diet or lifestyle  Circulatory system Cardiovascular disease Stroke Blood pressure Atrial septal defect Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Diabetes mellitus Heart Coronary heart disease Lung Hypertension Myocardial infarction Artery Blood vessel Decompression sickness Intravenous therapy Pulmonary alveolus Insulin Prostate cancer Nutrition Hypoglycemia Cholesterol Vein Obesity Dieting Coronary circulation Aneurysm Mitral regurgitation Traumatic brain injury Tocopherol Pulmonary embolism Coronary catheterization Cardiac cycle Jugular venous pressure Shock Fetus Rebreather Atkins Nutritional Approach Angina Cardiac arrhythmia Equine conformation Heart valve Cardiac output Pneumonia Turner syndrome Ischaemic heart disease Aortic dissection Folic acid Weight training Hypercholesterolemia First aid Siphon Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cirrhosis Cancer Drowning Dialysis Carbon dioxide Deep vein thrombosis Acute respiratory distress syndrome Kidney Heart sounds Coronary artery bypass surgery Multiple sclerosis Malaria Glaucoma Trans fat Atheroma Stomach cancer Diving regulator Anemia Hyperbaric oxygen therapy Oral contraceptive Organ transplant Physical examination Low-carbohydrate diet Low density lipoprotein Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus Aortic valve stenosis Medicine Blood Reptile Breastfeeding Lymphatic system Atrial fibrillation Milk Tobacco smoking William Harvey Cardiac stress test Growth hormone treatment Dietary fiber Polycythemia Hip fracture Obstetrics

what kind of heart murmur do i have link to audio file provided is there a cardiologist in the house i am interested in and have made recording my heartbeat a hobby at age i was diagnosed with an innocent murmur an ekg and an echo found nothing to worry about it took two doctors listening intently with their stethoscopes to detect the murmor i'm now and visited a different doctor for a checkup recently he detected the murmor immediately am i worried about nothing or should i ask to see a cardiologist i am curious if a doctor or cardiologist can tell from this mp recording what kind of murmur i might have this recording was made with a homemade stethoscope microphone and was recorded at the tricuspid valve area here is a link to the mp file http mercenary fileave com tricuspidvalvearea sec mp i think it's a pretty good recording but you may have to turn up your computer's volume to hear it thanks i'm impressed at the quality of your recording given that you used a homemade stethoscope microphone i would differ with eman somewhat in that your murmur is more of an early to midsystolic murmur i would add that it is crescendo decrescendo in nature and that there appears to be a gap between the first heart sound s and the onset of the murmur it also sounds like s splits physiologically with respiration but that is difficult to tell without physically examining you i disagree with eman that the murmur sounds like a mitral regurgitant or tricuspid regurgitant murmur these murmurs unless they are acute or associated with a noncompliant ventricle fill in the entire space between s and s neither does it sound like a vsd although it sounds like you were listening in the right area for one because those murmurs typically start at the same time as s your murmur sounds to me like an outflow murmur which can be due to turbulent flow across the aortic or pulmonic valve or simply due to high volume a bicuspid aortic valve is one possibility although you can usually see that on echo it can also be an innocent murmur in general echocardiograms are quite good at picking up causes for abnormal systolic murmurs so if you have had no symptoms and a normal echocardiogram at age it's probably not anything bad on the other hand it is never wrong to ask for a second opinion all we have to go on here is a single recording of your heart sounds from one location it requires a full history physical and appropriate testing to be able to confidently tell you that you have nothing to worry about hope that helps good luck  Mitral regurgitation Cardiac cycle Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Turner syndrome Heart Blood pressure Aortic valve Hypertension Mitral valve prolapse Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Coronary circulation Electrocardiogram Cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures Cardiac arrhythmia Medicine Mitral stenosis Prostate cancer Myocardial infarction Atrial fibrillation MP3 Pneumonia Endocarditis Physical examination Heart rate Medical ultrasonography Stethoscope Asthma Tetralogy of Fallot Doppler effect Stroke G-Man (Half-Life) Vacuum tube Urinary incontinence Hypoglycemia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Echocardiography Theory of conduct CPU cache Lupus erythematosus Anxiety Sound effect Binaural recording Milton H.

stress ecg test next week i am undergoing this test which is part of an employment contract i have had a heart murmour for several years and the upper left ventricle of my heart is inflamed although feeling very healthy and i cannot see this test 'being a problem' however i was wondering if this is a test that you 'pass' in terms of the outcome any points of view my future depends on this test it is sad to say i have undergone stress tests in a mere two years i've only had one that sounds like the one you will be having there's no 'passing' and 'failing' i don't see why an employer would be having you do this unless you work a very physical job really what the test does is just measure your heart rate and blood pressure when i had my test i found out that my heart skipped a few beats during exercise and that my blood pressure also dropped during exercise because of your heart murmur and or inflamed left ventricle you really need to make sure that there are trained professionals on site and tell them about your condition perhaps you should even call your doctor and tell him her about this test and see what they think because your left ventricle is the one that pumps blood through the aorta you really need to be careful before i had my surgery my left ventricle was enlarged due to my stenotic aortic valve my doctors thought it was too risky for me to have a stress test with my severe condition so you really do need to seek medical advice i take back what i said before here's how you 'pass' tell your doctor and make sure it's okay for you to have the test and make sure there are trained professionals that are comfortable with dealing with your condition at hand and if you don't something could happen and you might 'fail' i hope everything goes well  Aortic valve stenosis Heart Aortic insufficiency Aortic dissection Mitral regurgitation Atrial septal defect Cardiac cycle Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Myocardial infarction Heart sounds Blood pressure Cardiac arrhythmia Hypertension Mitral stenosis Urinary incontinence Heart valve Cardiology Circulatory system Traumatic brain injury Electrocardiogram Stroke Aorta Childbirth Clinical depression Medicine Atrial fibrillation Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Atherosclerosis Ventricular fibrillation Cardiovascular disease Heart rate Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tetralogy of Fallot Shock Turner syndrome Prostate cancer Psoriasis Fetus Physical examination Angina Patent ductus arteriosus Artery Fecal incontinence Mitral valve prolapse Stomach cancer Artificial pacemaker Aneurysm Aortic aneurysm Hypoglycemia Androgen insensitivity syndrome Obstetrics Insulin Cephalic disorder Health insurance Infantilism Physician Breastfeeding Intracranial pressure Cardiac arrest Transsexuality Pulse Emergency Medical Services Anorexia nervosa Dialysis Long QT syndrome Pneumonia Cirrhosis Asthma Marfan syndrome Coronary heart disease Stem cell Acute respiratory distress syndrome Coronary catheterization Explosive material Stress (medicine) Diabetes mellitus Exercise Coronary artery bypass surgery Combat stress reaction Organ transplant Diabetic retinopathy Tachycardia Software testing Pulmonary hypertension Atheroma History of anatomy in the 17th and 18th centuries Miscarriage Anxiety Alcoholism Lupus erythematosus Paget's disease of bone

mitral valve prolapse i was diagnosed with it about years ago do any of you guys have it mvp is a common heart disorder it occurs when the valve between your heart's left upper chamber left atrium and the left lower chamber left ventricle doesn't close properly when the left ventricle contracts the valve's leaflets bulge prolapse upward or back into the atrium in most people mitral valve prolapse is harmless and doesn't require treatment or changes in lifestyle it also doesn't shorten your life expectancy in some people with mitral valve prolapse however the progression of the disease requires treatment although mitral valve prolapse is a lifelong disorder many people with this condition never have symptoms in some people with mvp i have mvp the mitral valve malfunctions when blood leaks backwards through the valve it's called mitral regurgitation this is what happened to me and i had to had my mitral valve replaced but don't let that scare you that does not happen with most people just have regular check ups and have your mvp monitored if you start to have the following symptoms see your doctor a racing or irregular heartbeat arrhythmia dizziness lightheadedness difficulty breathing or shortness of breath often when lying flat or during physical exertion fatigue chest pain that's not associated with a heart attack or coronary artery disease click these links if you wish for more information regarding mvp http www mayoclinic com health mitral valve prolapse ds dsection http www americanheart org presenter jhtml identifier http www webmd com heart disease tc mitral valve prolapse overview http www nhlbi nih gov health dci diseases mvp mvp whatis html best wishes  Mitral stenosis Aortic insufficiency Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Cardiology Myocardial infarction Coronary circulation Cardiac cycle Cardiovascular disease Aortic dissection Electrocardiogram Traumatic brain injury Circulatory system Marfan syndrome Asthma Turner syndrome Stroke Pneumonia Panic attack Hypertension Aortic valve stenosis Decompression sickness Chronic fatigue syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Medicine Gastroesophageal reflux disease Hemorrhoid Coronary heart disease Hypoglycemia Lupus erythematosus Blood pressure Congestive heart failure Dialysis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cardiac stress test Equine conformation Cephalic disorder Cirrhosis Duchenne muscular dystrophy Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Anxiety Pulmonary hypertension Folic acid Ischaemic heart disease Doxepin Coeliac disease Angina Ventricular fibrillation Atherosclerosis Sickle-cell disease Kevin Trudeau Aortic valve Urinary incontinence Bipolar disorder Cardiac arrest Atrial flutter Air embolism Clinical depression Chest pain Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Intravenous therapy Mental illness Pulmonary embolism Artificial pacemaker Diabetic neuropathy Prolapse Childbirth Sleep apnea Rheumatic fever National Institutes of Health Polycystic kidney disease Trazodone Autoimmune diseases Parkinson's disease Propranolol Anemia Maprotiline Valsalva maneuver Heartworm Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome HyperText Transfer Protocol Cancer Crohn's disease World Wide Web Uniform Resource Locator Intracranial pressure Sexual dysfunction

smokin pot taking propranolol could harm im on propranolol for migranes and i want to take some pot i know that pot increases dopamine levels in the brain and propranolol decreases na and adrenaline receptors and reduces heart beat i don't want to stop prop treatment could pot harm i need a good answer um alex i smoked pot before and i'm very documented about it it helps a lot if you don't smoke in excess i'm sure i'll get plenty of thumbs down for this but i say it will only help pot is the only thing that gets rid of my lady cramps it's a very effective pain killer i smoke while on prescription medication all the time although i can't vouch for the safety of combining it with proranolol since i've never taken that but i'm on wellbutrin and lexapro for depression and still smoke no problems ps it's a bit ironic that alex is so anti pot and says how it will harm your brain yet he apparently can't type or articulate i guess he doesn't have the brain cells to spare  Propranolol Antidepressant Addiction Clinical depression Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cancer Cocaine Cannabis (drug) Stroke Drug addiction Migraine Hypoglycemia Chronic fatigue syndrome Nicotine Parkinson's disease Atherosclerosis Dopamine Alzheimer's disease Tobacco smoking Vitamin C Antipsychotic Insulin Caffeine Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Diazepam Maprotiline Asthma Bipolar disorder Lung cancer Growth hormone deficiency Methylphenidate Prostate cancer Breastfeeding Drug abuse Diabetes mellitus Growth hormone treatment Anxiety Methamphetamine First aid Psychosis Schizophrenia Intracranial pressure Withdrawal Decompression sickness Panic attack Mesothelioma Coffee Cardiovascular disease Psoriasis Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Alcoholism LSD Antiarrhythmic agent Electrophysiology Theory of conduct Pain Medicine Cannabinoids Opioid Obesity Animal testing Pneumonia Dietary fiber Stuttering COX-2 inhibitor Meditation Adrenergic receptor Hypnosis Breast cancer Chemotherapy Narcotic Epinephrine Amphetamine Multiple sclerosis Menstrual cycle Clozapine Calvin and Hobbes Hyperthermia Microeconomics Electroconvulsive therapy Paracetamol Illegal drug trade Doxepin Gamma-hydroxybutyrate Norepinephrine Anorexia nervosa Houseplant Creatine Stomach cancer Poker jargon Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Drowning Autism Urinary incontinence

heart question when i stand up sometimes or move suddleny my heart beat will slow down and feel like it has a slow pounding pace but then go back to normal in like or seconds is this a normal thing to happen i have had an ekg done and it was normal but when it happenes i get freaked out and i feel like it is not going to go back to normal but it always does thanks for your help well i piad more attention and what it does is speeds up when i get up then it slows way down real quick that's when i feel the slow pounding beat then goes to normal pace would this considered normal no it's not normal and you should seek further advice from your doctor the correct auto response to sudden action standing up running shock stress etc is for the pulse rate to speed up quickly to increase cardiac output the flight or fight syndrome your brain's failure to react in this way could lead to fainting or temporary feelings of weakness due to the loss of mean arterial pressure reducing flow of blood to the brain the 'slow pounding pace' you describe is predictable because the brain increases the amount of blood ejected from the heart at each stroke and this increases the pressure felt as a pounding or strong pulse to compensate for the failure of the pulse rate to rise properly i can suggest a source to read this up if you wish it's not necessarily serious but for instance it would debar you from passing a medical physical such as for obtaining a pilot's licence or some other occupations the important thing is to find out the cause and extent of the situation and to monitor whether it's improving or deteriorating or is in fact just temporary best wishes i hope it's helped re' your added details yes that's much more like an absolutely normal response you have nothing to worry about from all you've written good luck  Myocardial infarction Hypertension Cardiac arrhythmia Stroke Traumatic brain injury Atherosclerosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Drowning Aortic valve stenosis Hypoglycemia Cardiac stress test Action potential Heart rate Aortic insufficiency Aortic dissection Atrial septal defect Autism Atrial fibrillation Shock First aid Angina Mitral regurgitation Ventricular fibrillation Jet engine Apoplexy Urinary incontinence Cardiac output Chronic fatigue syndrome Atheroma Heart Prostate cancer Unemployment Multiple sclerosis Artificial pacemaker Aphasia Inflation Turner syndrome Diabetes mellitus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Explosive material Circulatory system Obstetrics Insulin Stopping power Cardiac arrest Chlorpromazine Equine conformation Physical examination Pulse Combine (Half-Life 2) Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome Coronary heart disease Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Hypothermia Deflation (economics) Microeconomics Asthma Psoriasis Tobacco smoking Cardiac cycle Free trade Cardiovascular disease Electrocardiogram Carbon dioxide Tachycardia Epilepsy Magnetic resonance imaging Stomach cancer Pneumonia Ozone depletion Coma Intracranial pressure Weight training Decompression sickness Out-of-body experience Economy of Russia Propranolol Panic attack Second language acquisition Time dilation Artery Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Speed of light A Course In Miracles Triage Alcoholism Growth hormone treatment Hypnosis Dieting Internal ballistics Sea level rise Cancer

can i be a police officer if i have wpw i just found out that i have wpw wolf parkinson's white i have heard that people who have that are not permitted to play high school or professional sports which doesn't bother me because i was planning on playing pro football but i also heard that you can't join the army with it and that kind of upset me because i almost wanted to does that mean i can't join the police force either aaron unfortunately i can't speak to what the police department's policy is on wolff parkinson white wpw but i can give you a bit of insight into the military's policy and what cardiologists generally recommend in terms of competitive sports the important thing is to know that all wpw is not the same the term wpw is generally used in reference to a condition in which there are accessory pathways in the heart allowing for ventricular preexcitation so what the heck does that mean the heart is normally made up of two upper chambers the atria and two lower chambers the ventricles that are electrically separated by a single gateway the av node normally an electrical signal starts from the sa node your inborn pacemaker at the top of the heart causing the top chambers to contract the electrical signal gets to the av node where it pauses for about of a second before continuing on causing the bottom chambers to contract the accessory pathway that is characteristic of wpw is an extra muscle bundle that connects the top and bottom chambers this gives the electrical signal an alternate route to the bottom chambers because the muscle bundle does not create a normal pause the way the av node does this can sometimes be seen on an ekg as premature activation of the bottom chambers the presence of the accessory pathway can yield two main problems the first is that it can be a set up for a short circuit wherein the electrical signal goes from the top chambers through the av node down to the bottom chambers backwards up through the accessory pathway and through the av node again over and over again when this happens the person with wpw feels their heart suddenly take off at a rate of bpm or more this is uncomfortable of course but usually not life threatening the reason we are concerned about wpw in athletes and in military pilots is that the av node being that is a sort of gatekeeper only allows so many impulses to get down to the bottom chambers per minute the accessory pathway has no such properties if a person with wpw develops a rhythm called atrial fibrillation in which the top chambers start beating at a rate of bpm or more the accessory pathway can allow the bottom chambers to be barraged by electrical impulses leading to a fatal rhythm called ventricular fibrillation that causes sudden death that is the main issue the good news is that wpw is a condition that is potentially curable so you have an extra connection we now have ways of getting rid of that abnormal connection with a non surgical procedure this is called radiofrequency rf ablation and in experienced hands has a success rate well over if a person has the previously mentioned signs of premature excitation of the bottom chambers on ekg but has never had an episode of an abnormal rhythm like i described above the risk of sudden death is actually very low usually these people are allowed to participate fully in sports but competitive athletes such as professionals or olympic athletes are often taken for further testing before being cleared any athlete who has had a history of an abnormal fast heartbeat must get further testing before they are allowed to compete the air force will not take anyone with the above described ekg abnormalities unless further evaluation shows no history of abnormal heart rhythms further testing means a catheter based procedure in which we look to see how well the accessory pathway can conduct an electrical signal the better a conductor it is the higher the risk to the patient if there is a history of abnormal heart rhythms or the accessory pathway appears to be a very good conductor we can use catheters to perform rf ablation and eliminate the accessory pathway once this is done the person with wpw is generally allowed to participate fully in competitive sports and can join the military a few months after successful ablation i strongly urge you to talk to your doctor and ask for referral to a cardiologist trained in electrophysiology if you have not already seen one they can tell you whether you would be allowed to join the military or the police force and whether you should have further testing and or radiofrequency ablation whew that's a lot of information i hope you find it helpful  Cardiac stress test Antiarrhythmic agent Tachycardia Traumatic brain injury Mitral regurgitation

pediatrician has refered my son to a pediatric cardiologist should i be worried my sons doctor heard a whoosh sound while listening to his heart he was born wit a murmur but dr says it is a different sound now than a murmur we go to the cardiologist monday and im scared you absolutely have every right to be worried and shame on your pediatrician for not explaining the problem to you regardless of whether they were sure or not usually a cardiologist referral is because your pediatrician is unsure if there is an issue and wants an expert in the field to confirm and diagnose this practice is very common and is the right thing to do most likely the sound he is reffering to is either a worsening of the murmur an aortic stenosis or some other congenital defect this really would depend on your child's age however you need to call your pediatrician and ask hime to explain what he she hear to you that is their job and they should tell you the truth demand it hope everything is alright  Pediatrics Heart sounds Cardiology Aortic valve stenosis Noonan syndrome Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Medicine Turner syndrome Marfan syndrome Phimosis Aortic dissection Physician Aortic insufficiency History of intersex surgery Heart valve Stroke Heart Atrial septal defect Congenital disorder Congenital heart defect Blood pressure Folic acid Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Aortic valve Myocardial infarction Androgen insensitivity syndrome American Academy of Pediatrics Breastfeeding Patent ductus arteriosus Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Stuttering Truth Atherosclerosis Autism epidemic James Dobson Intersex surgery Congenital hypothyroidism Growth hormone treatment Hearing impairment Transposition of the Great Arteries Infantilism Cephalic disorder Philosophy of language A Canticle for Leibowitz Von Willebrand disease Hypertension 21 July 2005 London bombings Sound effect Jon Secada Reincarnation Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Medical analysis of circumcision Endocrinology Physical examination Social rule Thimerosal Urinary incontinence Shaggy dog story Boom Town (Doctor Who) Cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures Coronary catheterization Sudden infant death syndrome Hypoglycemia Plame affair Endocarditis Tocopherol Prostate cancer Ethics Mental retardation Church of Christ, Scientist Book of Isaiah Sickle-cell disease Sports medicine Autism Religious Society of Friends Cardiac stress test Adult attention-deficit disorder Science Controversies in autism Harald V of Norway Heyde's syndrome Aorta Amy Yasbeck Genetics Atkins Nutritional Approach Abdominal pain Philosophical skepticism Asperger syndrome Growth hormone deficiency Nurse Roswell UFO incident Ren__ Favaloro EastEnders Tonality Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Intravenous therapy Mitral stenosis Incest Ventricular septal defect

i have panic attacks appts with high bp normal home how do they get any accurate numbers with panic pl i only take meds for appts which helps some but i really panic with appts i understand alot of people have panic attacks and then bp goes high then back down i have to take my bp at home how do they get any accurate numbers at appts for panic people this disorder is very misunderstood by many karen the phenomenon you describe is well known it even has a name white coat hypertension after the white coats that doctors traditionally wear unfortunately it is very difficult to get a good idea of usual blood pressures for these patients at their appointments alone i hesitate to say accurate because the measurements are accurate but they only reflect what the blood pressure is in the doctor's office and not what it is on a day to day basis one solution is to check the blood pressure after letting the patient relax for a bit once they are in a room obviously that doesn't always work the best option is for the doctor to order an ambulatory blood pressure monitor that the patient wears around this checks and records the blood pressure periodically throughout the day by reviewing the information from an ambulatory blood pressure monitor a doctor can tell what your blood pressure more typically runs having said that there is good research that shows that people with white coat hypertension are still at higher risk of heart disease than people without white coat hypertension their risk tends to fall somewhere between that of people with persistently high blood pressure and people with normal blood pressure readings hope that helps good luck to you  Hypertension Blood pressure Prostate cancer Obstetrics Sleep apnea Myocardial infarction Aortic dissection Turner syndrome Dialysis Cardiac stress test Pulmonary hypertension Coronary heart disease Traumatic brain injury Physical examination Anxiety Hypoglycemia Chronic fatigue syndrome Diazepam Asthma Angina Diabetes mellitus Malaria Glaucoma Bipolar disorder Anorexia nervosa Aortic insufficiency Psoriasis Medicine Migraine HIV test Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Growth hormone treatment Coeliac disease Propranolol Diabetic retinopathy Sildenafil Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Urinary incontinence Medical prescription Hemorrhagic stroke Folic acid Panic attack Drowning Atrial fibrillation Maprotiline First aid Lumbar puncture Atherosclerosis Cirrhosis Ventricular fibrillation Dieting Aneurysm Decompression sickness Vampire Surveillance Colorectal cancer Tobacco smoking IgA nephropathy Fast bowling Post-traumatic stress disorder Tocopherol Androgen insensitivity syndrome Insulin resistance Out-of-body experience Coronary catheterization Narcolepsy Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cancer Loudspeaker Polycystic ovary syndrome Homeopathy Penis Exercise Doxepin Clomipramine Clinical depression Gout Autism Stress (medicine) C-reactive protein ACE inhibitor Erectile dysfunction Schizophrenia Intravenous therapy National Institutes of Health Metabolic syndrome Publicly funded medicine

heart skipped two beats pvc's last night while laying in bed my heart suddenly felt very large and full of pressure and it gave a strong beat then skipped almost three beats i had enough time to think oh it's doing it again and then oh my god it hasn't started again i hit my chest hard on the left side panic and it then started to beat again but it was slower than usual for a while i have had this happen before the last time was similar except after it resumed beating it was very fast and erratic for about seconds before becoming normal my doc said possible pvc's without doing an exam anyone know anything about these symptoms btw i had no caffiene no alcohol and i am not stressed sorry i forgot to state that i am years old and i do not have much confidence in my doc's diagnoses because she is a nurse practitioner who specializes in women's health the dear women was checking me for mono when i had pleurisy and kidney stones which were both diagnosed in the er pvc's or premature ventricular contractions are actually quite common and harmless to most people pvc's occurring in the presence of heart disease can cause a harmful dysrythmia the message i get from your physician is that he is not too worried about a few random irregular heartbeats heart disease is diagnosed with a series of tests in most cases symptoms drive the pursuit of these tests in the past some symptoms in women have been overlooked as they do not always present with classic cardiac symptoms radiating chest pain etc if you have chest pain or have had pain in your neck or jaw which does or does not radiate to a shoulder or arm that is not explained otherwise you may be having symptoms of heart disease you didn't state your age in your question although heart disease can exist in a person of any age there is clearly greater cause for concern for anyone over the age of your symptoms should be your guide in pursuing your medical care if you are uneasy about your health status you should see a physician at once if you lack confidence in your physician's diagnosis you should consult another physician  Myocardial infarction Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Angina Cancer Pneumonia Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Stomach cancer Turner syndrome Aortic dissection Traumatic brain injury Asthma Hypoglycemia Stroke Urinary incontinence Cephalic disorder First aid Chronic fatigue syndrome Atrial fibrillation Bipolar disorder Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Childbirth Cardiac stress test Anxiety Physical examination Malignant melanoma Transsexuality Clinical depression Heart Atherosclerosis Electrocardiogram Lupus erythematosus Tobacco smoking Multiple sclerosis Obstetrics Atrial septal defect Hypertension Paget's disease of bone Diabetes mellitus Tocopherol Folic acid Panic attack Chest pain Medical analysis of circumcision Duchenne muscular dystrophy Psychiatry Schizophrenia Premature birth Cardiac arrest Lung cancer Mesothelioma Equine conformation Migraine Premature ventricular contraction Breast cancer Diagnosis Alcoholism Mitral regurgitation Fibromyalgia Alzheimer's disease Homeopathy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Syringomyelia Clomipramine Narcolepsy Anemia Alternative medicine Ventricular fibrillation Traditional Chinese medicine Aspartame Cirrhosis Decompression sickness Propranolol Crohn's disease Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Heart sounds Physician Pulmonary embolism Hodgkin's lymphoma Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder HIV test Autism Endometriosis Charles Darwin's illness Nostalgia Psoriasis Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Group A streptococcal infection Heartburn Growth hormone treatment Balance disorder Cancer of the larynx AIDS reappraisal

diagnosed with hocm in new consultant says it's not it is concentric hypertrophy is that better or worse ladywoodboy well neither i'm afraid now you don't say just where the enlargement is let me assume that it's on the left side of the heart ok both tend to have some obstruction to them the hocm generally has the wall of the septum between the ventricles doing the obstruction and the concentric has a downstream obstruction of the outflow from the ventricle doing the obstructing often in concentric hypertrophy the aortic valve has narrowed raising the pressure inside the ventricle and causing the enlargement but that means that even generalized high blood pressure can cause the concentric hypertrophy how is your blood pressure by the way how far into the diagnosis and treatment are you your new consultant did an echocardiogram to confirm concentric right how's your ejection fraction are you on calcium channel blockers doctors have to know the precise reason for the hypertrophy in order to treat it if it's aortic valve narrowing that's causing it a valve replacement can be very helpful your doc will walk youthrough all this good luck to you  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Aortic insufficiency Aortic dissection Mitral regurgitation Atrial septal defect Cardiology Heart Heart sounds Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Heart valve Cardiac cycle Atherosclerosis Coronary circulation Turner syndrome Mitral stenosis Aortic valve Cirrhosis Tetralogy of Fallot Pulmonary hypertension Cardiomyopathy Shock Stroke Intracranial pressure Aortic aneurysm Cardiovascular disease Aneurysm Circulatory system Asthma Echocardiography Atrial flutter Patent ductus arteriosus Traumatic brain injury Ventricular fibrillation Hydrocephalus Acute renal failure Urinary incontinence Sickle-cell disease Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Colorectal cancer Cephalic disorder Long QT syndrome Artery Inferior vena cava Sleep apnea Ventricular septal defect Marfan syndrome Angina Tobacco smoking Cardiac output Cardiac pacemaker Hydronephrosis Hirschsprung's disease Flecainide Benign prostatic hyperplasia Reptile Paget's disease of bone Prostate cancer Coronary heart disease Anabolic steroid Constrictive pericarditis Cardiac arrest Alzheimer's disease Heyde's syndrome Coeliac disease Transposition of the Great Arteries Calcium channel blocker Prolactinoma Pneumonia Dam Electrophysiology Syringomyelia Stomach cancer Radiation therapy Physical examination Siphon Carburetor Psoriasis Lupus erythematosus Thermal power station Kidney Spark plug Antihypertensive Apoplexy Emphysema Cancer Fetus Mesothelioma Maprotiline

mitral regurgitaion question i was diagnosed with mvr i experience chest pains so badly that it feels like someone is stabbing me all over my chest and upper back my heart skips every beats and i get tachycardia often and it feels like my heart is going to explode my cardiologist says that all of this is normal and i shouldnt worry about it and if in years it doesnt get better i will need my mitral valve replaced well i am worried about it the tachycardia bothers me so much and the chest pains are horribly painful what can i do or what is your opinion mitral valve regurgitation means that one of the valves in your heart the mitral valve is not closing tightly this lets blood leak backward into your heart when that happens your heart may have to work harder than it should you may need to take one or more medicines such as an ace inhibitor to help your heart work better or a diuretic to ease the load on your heart it is important to watch for symptoms of heart failure they may mean that your heart is weakening and your valve problem is getting worse symptoms of heart failure include shortness of breath being very tired and swelling in your feet and ankles if you have these symptoms call your doctor small valve leaks are usually not a problem but if you have heart failure symptoms or if you have a sudden leak you may need surgery to repair or replace the valve finding out that something is wrong with your heart is scary you may feel depressed and worried this is a common reaction sometimes it helps to talk to others who have similar problems ask your doctor about support groups in your area  Mitral regurgitation Cardiology Aortic insufficiency Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Myocardial infarction Prostate cancer Pneumonia Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Heart sounds Atrial fibrillation Heart valve Marfan syndrome Cardiac arrhythmia Atrial septal defect Traumatic brain injury Turner syndrome Anxiety Mitral stenosis Shock Chronic fatigue syndrome Medicine Heart Asthma Urinary incontinence Panic attack Multiple sclerosis Atherosclerosis Equine conformation Propranolol Cardiovascular disease Physical examination Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Cancer Stroke Endocarditis Rheumatic fever Folic acid Hypertension Electrocardiogram Angina Diabetes mellitus Professional wrestling holds Aspartame Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Congestive heart failure Lupus erythematosus Mesothelioma Gastroesophageal reflux disease Dialysis Cardiac cycle Weight training Gout M__ni__re___s disease Rebreather Aortic valve stenosis Patent ductus arteriosus Diabetic neuropathy Coronary circulation 2000 Australian Grand Prix Transsexuality Psoriasis Childbirth Cocaine Cirrhosis Coeliac disease Milton H.

what can i expect after difibrilation from an icd i just got a shock this weekend while i was on vacation i have been feeling a little bit weird ever since i just wanted to know if it is normal to feel an abnormal rythm afterward i haven't felt the same ever since if you have gotten shocked what are the possiblities that i could get shocked again is being shocked once mean you are going to be shocked again i just need to know i've been shocked times it's a traumatic experience and that may have some impact on how you feel i only felt odd after the shock for the remainder of the day i took it very easy being shocked once does not have a bearing on being shocked again it goes off when your rhythm is out however if you are having a problem it may be subject to firing if you meet the criteria call your cardiologist and inform him of the firing right away he will most likely want to do a download to see what happened it will also record any non sustained events they take it seriously meanwhile don't play with light sockets  Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Post-traumatic stress disorder Anorexia nervosa Grief Equine conformation Cardiac arrhythmia Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Milton H.

what is a delay in the heart my year old son was in the hospital over the weekend with seizure type symptoms some of the doctors told me his heart has a delay one cardiology report states this and the other report says it's normal there are conditions such as ectopic beat and extrasystoles that cause what appears to be one or more skipped beats generally it's not dangerous unless the skipping occurs so much that the person loses consciousness or gets dizzy from the temporary lack of blood flow to the brain and falls or has an accident while driving there are procedures that can be used to stop the condition if it is troublesome a guy i know had it done recently and also former prime minister tony blair had it done a couple of years ago in my friend's case he was falling down and getting hurt and he couldn't drive a car he's apparently fine now hasn't fallen and is back behind the wheel  Cardiac arrhythmia Traumatic brain injury Stroke Myocardial infarction Epilepsy Hypoglycemia Seizure Heart First aid Panic attack Drowning Atrial fibrillation Intracranial pressure Cephalic disorder Bleeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pneumonia Aspartame Ventricular fibrillation The Inside Head injury Chronic fatigue syndrome Diabetes mellitus Prostate cancer Concussion of the brain Anxiety Narcolepsy Maprotiline Ebola Atherosclerosis Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Hypertension Miscarriage Electroconvulsive therapy Clomipramine Intravenous therapy Insulin Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Urinary incontinence Hyperthermia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Banned episodes of Pok__mon Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Suicide methods Cerebral palsy Decompression sickness Atrial septal defect Cardiology Artificial pacemaker Folic acid Asperger syndrome Obstetrics Psychosis Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Shock Dehydration Controversies in autism Indianapolis 500 Stomach cancer Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Alcoholism Eddie Guerrero Tony Blair Chernobyl accident Hypothermia Apoplexy Death Coeliac disease Knots Landing Migraine Prime Minister One Tree Hill (TV series) Post-traumatic stress disorder Bipolar disorder Aortic dissection Subdural hematoma Abortion Roller coaster Sin City Sleep Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis March 2005 in Canada Stopping power Autism Heart sounds Cardiopulmonary resuscitation Tourniquet Tobacco smoking Multiple sclerosis Triage Animal testing Cordelia Chase Turner syndrome Malaria Milton H.

question about coughing after heart surgery my grandpa had a triple bypass around months ago he was on a ventilator after the surgery for several days longer than usual patients as he only has one kidney since the surgery he has been having lots of coughing fits the dr has stated that it ios possibly the ventilator which has caused some scarring on his throat all they have recommended is cough medicine to try and stop the coughing a few days this week he has been coughing so hard he is sick was just wondering if anyone knows if these coughing fits are normal and if they have any other remedies they could recommend to help stop the coughing i am a respiratory therapist and i often worked with post op bypass patients it's not uncommon for older patients to develop pulmonary infections due to reduced lung function that normally follows any kind of surgery especially thoracic surgery while the tube down the throat causes irritation for awhile i'd think nine months is a long time for that i would ask his doctor if he would order a chest xray at least to give him more information about whats going on in your grandpa's chest  Pneumonia Medicine Acute respiratory distress syndrome Asthma Common cold Tuberculosis Lung cancer Urinary incontinence Pulmonary alveolus Atrial septal defect Gastroesophageal reflux disease Physical therapy Cancer Lung Prostate cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Group A streptococcal infection Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mechanical ventilation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cystic fibrosis Psoriasis Pulmonology Organ transplant Cough medicine First aid Pulmonary embolism Radiation therapy Bronchitis Aspergillosis Drowning Myocardial infarction Emphysema Traumatic brain injury Stomach cancer Angioplasty Coronary artery bypass surgery Heartworm Shock Stroke Acupuncture Pulmonary edema Scar Breastfeeding Goodpasture's syndrome Infectious mononucleosis Liquid breathing Replacement joint Nasal congestion Turner syndrome Cephalic disorder Intravenous therapy Hip fracture Duchenne muscular dystrophy Amiodarone Dialysis Acne Ulcerative colitis Adverse effect (medicine) Tobacco smoking Pulmonary aspiration Thoracotomy Tourette syndrome AIDS Intensive care medicine Glycogen storage disease type I Respiratory system Medical cannabis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Surgery Intubation Insulin Medical ventilator Obesity Myasthenia gravis Spirometry Orthopedic surgery Traditional Chinese medicine Androgen insensitivity syndrome Cardiopulmonary resuscitation Aortic dissection Bubonic plague Equine conformation X-ray Emergency Medical Services Medieval medicine Angina
