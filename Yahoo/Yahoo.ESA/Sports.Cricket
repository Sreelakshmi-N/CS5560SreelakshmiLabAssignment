dhoni is done so far he has gone from bad to worse since the world cup yea he made a decent in the second innings of the st test against england but he and india got lucky when play was delayed he took the aerial route way too many times and got lucky then he put up squat in the second test and now in the warmup match against sri lanka a he puts up and in a day match wow dinesh karthik should come up as the wicket keeper now and they should put yuvraj singh back into the mix take out laxman in the process and maybe put in irfan pathan its time for him to return he's been away from the national scene for a long time he and the other two lefties will create all sorts of havoc for england i mean day was ended early not delayed i think they should replace dhoni with yuvraj however they have a wicketkeeper dinesh karthik in the team because yuvraj will help a lot as he is a leftie so in the middle order with laxman or whoever there are two lefties ganguly and yuvi so it will help india to unsettle the bowlers with their line and length irfan pathan should not come back instead they should take out sree santh and put in ishant sharma or ranadeb bose as agarkar is not in the squad but i think they should remove sree santh  Indian cricket team Border-Gavaskar Trophy International cricket in 2005 Ravi Shastri Australian cricket team Cricket Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 2005 English cricket season Mahendra Singh Dhoni August 2005 in sports Yuvraj Singh 2003 Cricket World Cup Fielding (cricket) Follow-on Test cricket Bradman Cup 20:20 Tournament 2005/6 One-day International Adam Gilchrist Fast bowling English cricket team History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Saurav Ganguly Laxman Sivaramakrishnan West Indian cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005 1996 Cricket World Cup Laws of cricket History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Wicket-keeper History of Test cricket (to 1883) New Zealand cricket team Rahul Dravid Zimbabwean cricket team Norway national football team ICC Super Series 2005 Timeline of cricket 1986 ICC Trophy Dismissal (cricket) James Anderson (cricketer) 1957 World Series 2005 Afro-Asian Cup Anil Kumble International cricket in 2005-06 Melbourne Cricket Ground Roy Dias Sachin Tendulkar 2005 ICC Trophy Batting (cricket) One-day cricket Bowling strategy (cricket) 2005 Ashes series 1999 Cricket World Cup Andrew Strauss The Ashes Pakistani cricket team February 2005 in India Tied Test Shane Warne First-class cricket Graham Dilley History of cricket Malcolm Marshall Left-arm orthodox spin George Lohmann South Africa A cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Imran Khan Muttiah Muralitharan September 2005 in sports Rajput Wasim Akram Steve Harmison Over (cricket) Brian Close 2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup Cricket pitch Sidath Wettimuny Sydney Riot of 1879 Courtney Walsh Michael Vaughan C.K.

what do you say about decision of umpire for giving ganguly out i think ball was first touched the bat and then pad sourav ganguly is my favourite though not the player of my country but i am praying for his bright future he is the right player and right captain i dont know how an international umpire can give out twice which can be easily spotted that was really ridiculous some felt he couldn't play the bouncer others swore that he was god on the off side some laughed at his lack of athleticism others took immense pride in his ability to galvanise a side sourav ganguly's ability to polarise opinion led to one of the most fascinating dramas in indian cricket yet nobody can dispute that he was india's most successful test captain forging a winning unit from a bunch of talented but directionless individuals and nobody can argue about him being one of the greatest one day batsmen of all time despite being a batsman who combined grace with surgical precision in his strokeplay his career had spluttered to a standstill before being resurrected by a scintillating hundred on debut at lord's in later that year he was promoted to the top of the order in odis and along with sachin tendulkar formed one of the most destructive opening pairs in history when he took over the captaincy after the match fixing exposes in he quickly proved to be a tough intuitive and uncompromising leader under his stewardship india started winning test matches away and put together a splendid streak that took them all the way to the world cup final in later that year in australia an unexpected and incandescent hundred at brisbane set the tone for the series steve waugh's last where india fought the world's best team to a standstill victory in pakistan turned him into a cult figure but instead of being a springboard for greater things it was the peak of a slippery slope  English cricket team 2003 Cricket World Cup Indian Oil Cup 2005 World Cricket Tsunami Appeal Indian national cricket captains Cricket Test cricket Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Adam Gilchrist One-day International Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 The Ashes International cricket in 2005 Pakistani cricket team History of Test cricket (to 1883) Batting (cricket) Border-Gavaskar Trophy Kapil Dev History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Brian Close Glenn McGrath Laws of cricket Melbourne Cricket Ground ICC Super Series 2005 Imran Khan Sydney Riot of 1879 History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) 2005 Afro-Asian Cup 1996 Cricket World Cup History of cricket Fielding (cricket) Michael Vaughan Dennis Lillee Batsman One-day cricket Javed Miandad Batting average Tied Test Mahendra Singh Dhoni English national cricket captains Brian Lara Captain (cricket) Muttiah Muralitharan Sunil Gavaskar Norway national football team Wilfred Rhodes Andrew Strauss John McEnroe Saeed Anwar Australian national cricket captains Ian Botham W.

how do you measure the speed someone is bowling a cricket ball i would like to see how fast i bowl a cricket ball but i don't have a clue of how to do it can somebody please help well it's difficult you can get someone with a stopwatch waiting for the ball to pass them at the crease but it's difficult to be accurate time the release of the ball to the crease then use spee distance time much easier is to go to a cricket net run by your local county side who have speed guns or other measuring equipment they often let you use the nets during or after games for a small fee and you could ask them they also do this for free at games sometimes on a strip off the pitch keep your eye out if youre at a game such as a twenty twenty or a test match good luck  Cricket Fast bowling Batting (cricket) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 No ball Cricket pitch Umpire (cricket) History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Fielding (cricket) Bowling strategy (cricket) Test cricket History of Test cricket (to 1883) Indoor cricket 2005 English cricket season Brian Close Sydney Riot of 1879 Types of bowlers in cricket Australian cricket team Batsman History of cricket Yorker Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Run (cricket) Dismissal (cricket) Ravi Shastri Cricket ball West Indian cricket team Short form cricket W.
