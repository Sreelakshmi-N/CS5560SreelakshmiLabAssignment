compatibility question please help okay my birthday is january time am the guy i am curious if i'm somewhat compatable with was born febuary any information is highly appreciated your sun sign is capricorn and his is aquarius capricorn and aquarius do opposites attract often do they stay together sometimes but in this case your differences might be too great the outcome of this match will depend on what you see and what you get are you appalled or thrilled by your aquarius mate's anti establishment views and penchant for rocking the boat while this may seem exciting at first capricorns are traditionalists at heart aquarius have none of your natural caution about ripping apart the status quo at times your lover's interests will seem too trendy and flighty like he or she is always ready to pick up the movement of the moment even if your lover isn't like that aquarius are a great deal cooler in temperament than you are their view is one of objectivity not emotion in time you may long for someone more stable demonstrative and cuddly something your lover may never be there are other differences in your heart of hearts you are class conscious you want to live in the right neighborhood wear the right clothes and send your kids to the right school aquarius aren't into this at all for inside they have the most democratic of hearts and they live a life to match their beliefs both of you are leaders but in different ways you gain recognition in large formal institutions by carefully climbing the ladder of success and dealing deftly with company politics your aquarius finds satisfaction by working within groups not necessarily corporate for social good if they are frustrated at work aquarius are likely to do some meaningful volunteer work perhaps for a non profit cause aquarius belong to the world so if you were hoping for a little man or woman who would be there for you at the end of the day think again you may have to watch them shout from a bullhorn in front of city hall or meet up with them at a cyber cafe another difference is what constitutes a great night out capricorns want to check the zagat guide and choose a four star restaurant aquarius want to eat vegetarian at a little hole in the wall around the corner capricorns want to discuss plays and literature aquarius want to talk about school busing or the finer points of java script capricorns adore history and objects from the past while an aquarius may reject all that has come before aquarius live for the future in bed you are very sensual and so is your aquarius lover but he or she is more likely than you to view sex as fun and games you may or may not be turned on by your partner's love of adult videos and other modern turn ons spiritually aquarius have none of the instincts toward enduring relationships that you do their house of love is ruled by gemini a thinking sign so their head rules their heart you are realistic but highly ethical too and any kind of promiscuity will turn you off even if you are just dating your aquarius can you work this out like anything else it's all up to you  Human sexual behavior Astrological sign Zodiac Infantilism Social rule Atheism Love Same-sex marriage Shaggy dog story Solar system in astrology Childlove movement About a Boy Philosophy of language Child sexuality Zoophilia Human nature Art Soul Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Abortion debate Restaurant Friedrich Schleiermacher House (astrology) New Age Aquarius Theory of conduct Death Capricornus Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Poker jargon Sexual orientation Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Cyberspace Avenue Q Consensus decision-making Object-oriented programming Undergrads History of sex Aesthetic Realism Goodness and value theory Karl Marx Wall Street Chinese calendar The Twelve Labours Simone Weil Predestination Surveillance Thinks ...

can you tell me everything about an can you tell me everything about a a female cancer me a male scorpio my boy friend a female pisces my best friend cancer woman she is the most emotional sign and she'll definitely wear her heart on her sleeve she'll even go as far as expressing her emotions which are more like opinions when everyone else thinks she ought to just stay quiet she is consumed by what she finds sentimental so much that everyone will know what she is empathetic and sympathetic toward and believe me she'll be emotional about it she is equally emotional about what is sentimental and what she wards off basically she comes on very strong once she starts talking getting a word in edge wise may be your crowning moment for the year this woman can completely yank the hinges off all rules and regulations or crawl with her crab like ways under your skin just to get a rise out of someone who is reserved if you are regimented look out because she's looking for a way to break your regiment and she'll get a kick out of doing it if the cancer woman finds some outdated guidelines rules or restrictions she'll literally clean house in the home and professional environment after all she rules the home and family therefore cleaning house or doing make overs is her m o modus operandi she moves along in her crab like way taking one step forward and two steps side ways then she'll stick out those pinchers and retreat back into her shell she'll keep you on your toes or pinch them in the process you may find her emotions at either end of the pendulum she can be the consummate party girl or the pity party girl reminding you of what she didn't have when she was growing up security means everything to her especially emotional security you can give her all the diamonds yachts and money in the world but what she really wants to know is that she has your emotional security and unfailing love in her quest to find the perfect male early on she may expect to be saved thereby attracting a tyrant who will take advantage of her need for dependence as she matures she'll find what she really desires is a rock that she can count on scorpio man the most important thing you should know about this man is his highly suspicious mind but wait there is a logical explanation for his suspicious mind scorpio is the consummate researcher and fact finding gatherer his naturally probing and investigative mind causes him to question beneath the surface of what he actually sees scorpio naturally rules the th house mystery transformation legacies and sex therefore his mind is inquisitive and investigative beyond what he can actually see if you truly understand how his suspicion mind works then it will be easier to interpret his actions and reactions while scorpio man is getting to know you he is not suspecting you of inappropriate behavior by asking you questions what he is doing is waiting wondering and studying his prospective partner until he is sure of you this man is famous for being jealous accusatory and over protective if he feels any inappropriate behavior on your part or if he has uncovered a mismatch in your testimony you better believe he'll call you on it he may appear obsessive because his mind is always questioning something naturally ruled by the planet pluto he is powerful and dynamic scorpion man is strict severe passionate and intense in his beliefs and behavior he's so intense and passionate that the color burgundy which runs deeper than red will actually get his attention this man is also serious shrewd and not at all superficial he means it whatever it is if this man says he loves you believe it he can be quite intimidating either personally or professionally because he is neither indifferent or casual he may appear pessimistic to his core but this is only because he is prone to question first he will see right through any fake appearances scorpio men make excellent police officers investigators detectives researchers or anyone who's job it is to question constantly he is generally attracted to women who have a sunny disposition and an engaging personality which ironically is the opposite of his yes this man is very sexual as the saying goes if you want good sex go to bed with a scorpion sex is important to him and he will have no problem showing it he's a mystery man known in the zodiac as agent pisces woman and you thought leo's were dramatic just because they rule stage drama and theater oh contrare my dear pisces woman is the undisputed heavyweight champion of the prima donna and drama queen world she has a tendency to dramatize every impression and feeling drama personified is the usual astrologer's statement of the pisces woman she may be the last sign in the zodiac but she encompasses qualities of all the sun sign women who came before her instead of getting two personalities as in the gemini woman you'll wind up with twelve women all wrapped up in one sweet and demure package her theme song is i'm everyone by whitney houston and she's certainly a paradox being such a fluid sign she's a walking talking inconsistency it's no wonder two fish swimming opposite directions is her symbol the two fish represent her vices and virtues her victimization and victories her fragility as well as her survival instincts she is one of a kind or twelve in one kind existing can sometimes be overwhelming to pisces woman pisces is the most impressionable sign because they are so influenced by other people and their surroundings therefore this impressionism can make for a high strung nature and make existing overwhelming her first diploma will come from the school of hard knocks therefore even though she may display herself as a victim you'll also witness her inner strength and tough as nails survival mode she is a survivor and will grow through her most negative experiences pisces is also known as the escape artist houdini sign because she thoroughly enjoys her solitude she will require others to do her bidding for her and this will be one of her means of escape yet at the same time she maintains a connection to the world even through someone else if there is a way out pisces woman will find it as a young woman she will find sensitive inexperienced and immature men who are more fragile than her as pisces woman gets older she will be more attracted to an attentive and strong man who will treat her like a princess instead of a drama queen the solitude she has long sought will be found in his emotionally strong and supportive arms  EastEnders Gender role The Twelve Labours

can someone tell me about my future maybe thanks yous my name is angelica villanueva i was on january th i am capricorn i would just like to know a little bit about my future and any future relationships coming thank you i would appreciate it with a smile numerology sample reading base on your date of birth january this year marriage family and community are highlighted now your feelings are your focus at this time and your intuitive abilities are much easier to access now creativity is also at hand and redecorating or remodeling the home often occurs during this time this is also a time when you may be asked to make commitments marriage children partnerships of all types are forming you are emanating love and nurturing and many will be on your doorstep during this time life path or destiny the destiny number describes the life lessons that we have come here to learn it reveals to us the path we must take and the role we must play to fulfill our mission often our choice of career is based on this vibration and if not then it will manifest through avocational pursuits we may attract people and experiences into our lives that mirror the traits of this number for us so that we may develop into our highest potential we don't always welcome our life lessons so it is a possibility that we may even feel an aversion to the characteristics of our destiny number in other people and we may ourselves act the opposite in spite of the many ways we may choose to react to this force within us we have been gifted with all of the talents and energy needed to fulfill our destiny you contain all of the qualities of the humanitarian patient wise and compassionate you love in a way that can choose no favorites you are here to love and to serve all equally and without prejudice others are drawn to you as a role model and it is your responsibility in life to be the embodiment of integrity wisdom and inspiration you are attracted to the fine arts and philosophy and you seem to have a direct line to higher wisdom you will always receive all that you need it is important that you focus your attention on service cycles the destiny is divided into great cycles each governing us for specific durations throughout our life the seed cycle begins at birth and colours our experiences through childhood and adolescence during the year nearest our th birthday we move into the fruit cycle which remains throughout the middle part of our life until the year nearest our th birthday and the harvest cycle carries on from there taken all together the cycles show us our particular path that will lead to the fulfillment of our destiny seed when is the seed cycle it is more difficult as the child is surrounded by other people guiding their life and the inner desire for independence freedom and self motivation can lead to conflicts with authority or withdrawal fruit freedom change and restlessness keeps you spinning through this cycle opportunities should be explored and stagnation avoided many journeys and experiences are likely and you may feel as though you have lived lives in this one it may be hard to find an occupation or career that will allow the free movement you require there is likely to be much travel if only in your mind and romances will many although they all probably seem to have a just a few of the traits you're looking for harvest this is a time of fun and creative expression you're likely to be in the spotlight somehow and you've got a large audience it's a good time to write the book you've always had in mind or take art classes the so called retirement years are a second youth for you pinnacles the four pinnacles reveal the high spots or heights of attainment that we are likely to encounter as we move along the path of our life the st pinnacle lasts from birth to around age the nd pinnacle lasts for years after that the rd pinnacle lasts more years and the th pinnacle carries on through the rest of our life the peak of the pinnacle is reached during the next personal year pinnacles are like sudden inheritances from a benevolent aunt they can transform the prevailing energies completely and suddenly it is useful to look ahead and prepare for our pinnacles so that we can maximize their gifts to us and shape them into the most positive manifestation first pinnacle a time for giving nurturing and taking responsibility for others the pinnacle brings in domestic vibrations and a marriage may begin or improve during this time second pinnacle strength ambition and material success are attainable at this time this is the period of harvesting all of the fruits from the seeds you have sown up to now it's a very good time to build a business as the money will be there and those in power are willing to assist you third pinnacle adventure change and exploration mark this as a period of exciting growth and discovery travel romance and freedom of every kind of expression is the urge during this pinnacle fourth pinnacle all things earthly come under the vibration and therefore material manifestation is the end result when the logical laws of this earth are followed step by step insight analysis and persistence will move you through every obstacle challenges the three challenges show us the major influences demanding our attention during specific sections of our lifetime the st challenge influences the years from birth to age the nd challenge takes over from age to and the third affects us our whole life challenges shape our attitudes and can affect our health these vibrations that challenge us cause either an exaggeration of the associated qualities or a lack of them both of which are extremes which need to be brought into balance first challenge challenge children are usually given a lot of duties and disciplined into schedules and organization to the point that the creative impulse is quieted to a whisper as teenagers four's are the one's who have the next ten years of their life planned what profession which college etc they have their beliefs and values down pat and could show you the file they have them written in fun and creative expression are the balancing agents for four which are found in the three and the five second challenge this is the challenge of sensitivity and self sacrifice two's look for needs to be filled in others and attempt to fill those needs while ignoring their own all with the hope that someone will take care of them in return it is possible that a two challenger can manifest just the opposite as well and be preoccupied with their own needs feelings desires beliefs to the point that other people are only here to fill their endless requirements balance is found between the independence of and the self expression of third challenge the challenge of the thin skinned these challenge holders take everything personally and can easily turn tiny little mole hills into you know whats they can seem to become translucent absorbing each new idea and each new person into themselves becoming them in the process the is the number of the psychic however the challenge is to maintain one's own identity while accepting the powerful empathic abilities of the the main focus of the challenge holder is themselves their feelings their wants their lack of satisfaction their outer behavior is geared to keeping the peace and taking care of others while secretly hoping they will be taken care of in return the remedy for this challenge is to become an equal partner in relationships to realize that their ideas and opinions are valid and to stop flattering love out of people love blessings milly  Seventh Sea (collectible card game) God Abortion debate Equine conformation Mystique (comics) Meaning of life

what can u tell me about librans libra jst wondering about horoscopes libras are the most romantic and charming of all the signs they look good in almost any clothing they put on effortlessly clothes just seem to hang on them beautifully also libra emphasizes any tendency to beauty in the body particularly the face libra men and women sometimes have those gorgeous full bee stung lips also called cupid's bow lips libra people feel troubled if they are not involved with someone romantically so you rarely see a truly single libra after age or this is probably the sign most likely to marry but again it is also a sign who will not stay in a marriage in many cases libra people sometimes gain a reputation for trading up in life spotting some beautiful or wealthy new guy or girl and just abandoning their current love flirting is like breathing to libra who simply must be noticed and appreciated to feel good about himself yet libra people are gentle and they can see both sides of any argument or political question they take forever to make even the simplest decision and hate to be asked to choose a destination like a restaurant they go out of their way to make other people happy and can be seen as sycophantic but if you push them too far and the scales of balance are disturbed this sign will unleash a torrent of angry words on you they will remember every slight that ever happened and call you on it in no uncertain terms basically you have a very tender sweet sign who loves romance and dating and frequently changes her mind in the course of a day she will look good always be diplomatic and a natural problem solver but will at times lose patience and walk away from the current situation libra people are very compatible in romance with other air signs aquarius and gemini and with the fire signs leo aries and sagittarius sometimes you will have a libra who has a great chemistry with taurus but it's not likely health concerns in some librans include the kidneys and the lower back make sure you get plenty of fluids each day and avoid over tiring that back good luck tab  Astrological sign Zodiac Solar Element Saga Libra Birthday Social rule Humphrey Bogart The Twelve Labours W.I.T.C.H.

what does a sagittarrian woman look like i dont know about look like but i do know what they like sagittarians are open minded especially about philosophy and religion they are also strong and outspoken in their own beliefs sometimes to the point of exaggeration sagittarians can procrastinate and be self indulgent and sometimes their carefree ways hurt people who want to be close to them but sagittarians truly want to be a friend to the world and they can get along with almost any kind of person they also love gambling and taking risks which usually turns out well because they are lucky as well as smart  Theory of conduct Peter Griffin Social rule Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Sigmund Freud Predestination Philosophy of religion Magical thinking Evil Procrastination Supernatural Theology Pacifism Simone Weil The nature of God in Western theology A Course In Miracles Animism Jiddu Krishnamurti Socrates Dissociative identity disorder Sikh religious philosophy Atomic Kitten Religious Society of Friends Internalism and externalism Gambling Alcoholics Anonymous Epistemology Married... with Children Donald Davidson (philosopher) Anger management Jedi Human About a Boy Abortion debate Reality Western philosophy Belief Bertrand Russell R.E.M.

are we compatible me rising sign pisces sun sign sagittarius moon sign capricorn pm cst him rising sign taurus sun sign aquarius moon sign leo pm est your sun signs sagittarius fire and aquarius air are compatible your rising signs pisces water and taurus earth are compatible your moon emotions signs of capricorn earth and leo fire are not compatible he was born under a full moon moon in leo opposite his sun in aquarius this placement can cause many relationship problems due to restlessness nervousness and stress caused by the full moon's effect this restlessness combined with the fixed sign of taurus presents a stubborn and inflexible personality the influence of this full moon opposition has an even more unfavorable influence because his rising sign in taurus creates a square aspect to the sun in aquarius as well as a square aspect to the moon in leo and an opposition to the descendant in scorpio all in fixed signs this creates what is known as a t cross all positions i have mentioned for the st th th and th houses called the angles are considered triggers this means besides the unfavorable characteristics of this aspect being prominent in his chart causing behavioral problems daily whenever a transiting planet aligns with one or more of these positions it can create chaos and havoc in the relationship the influence and length of this crisis would be determined upon the transiting planet because your rising sign is in pisces and the compatible planets i denoted above you will want to be with this person more to help this person than to love this person however your moon in capricorn gives you the ability to detach yourself so you will not accept his on again off again non committal attitude toward a relationship with you this combination is not favorable to you at all and any relationship formed will certainly be short lived hurtful has the capability to cause complex and serious problems  Zodiac House (astrology) Solar system in astrology Capricornus Western astrology Medical astrology The Twelve Labours Astronomy on Mars Ruling planet Aquarius Astrology Leo Parallax Chinese calendar Wheel of the Year Birthday Taurus (constellation) Tide Saint Seiya Moon Pisces Astrological aspect Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn, & Jones, Ltd.

why do people read the horoscope section just to tell people they shouldnt rely on horoscopes people ask horoscope and compatibility questions and people answer with things like don't believe in astrology etc i'm just wondering why good question i think there are a variety of motives for people offering their unsolicited and uninformed opinions on astrology including fear of what they don't understand ignorance closed mindedness arrogance viewing astrology as some sort of threat to their own belief system in the end what all these individuals have in common is an intolerance of difference and a desire to impose their views on those who dare to think differently from them  Astrology History of astrology Horoscope Supernatural Biblical inerrancy Theory of conduct Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Religion Deconstruction Epistemology Merit Fundamentalism Chinese astrology Atheism Witchcraft Cultural relativism The nature of God in Western theology Criticism of libertarianism Magic (paranormal) Noam Chomsky Asperger syndrome Philosophy Goodness and value theory Jyotish Creationism A Course In Miracles Zodiac Coercion Intelligent design Socrates Philosophical method Utilitarianism Nicomachean Ethics Simone Weil Originalism Buddhism Objectivist philosophy End times Scientology beliefs and practices Reparative therapy Animism Plame affair Philosophical skepticism Social psychology Libertarianism Sexual orientation Predestination Philosophy of language Natal chart Economics Franz Boas Internet troll Cult Presuppositional apologetics Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Human nature New Age Psychology of religion Soul Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Human Discordianism Charles Darwin's views on religion Alignment (role-playing games) George Lakoff Psychology Religious pluralism Maimonides Alchemy Ethics Belief Reality Anthroposophy Parapsychology Philosophy of science Status of religious freedom in France Scientific skepticism Religious conversion John Wycliffe Altruism Autism rights movement Jiddu Krishnamurti David Hume Law of value Cognitive science Conscience Prayer Free will Education Propaganda Anarchism and capitalism Afterlife Horary astrology Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Mathematician Black (people) Meaning of life Prem Rawat Federal World Government

why i never doubt on trusting scorpios but i am afraid to trust virgos i've virgo friends lately and i am afraid to trust them because i feel something is wrong i've scorpio friends they are trustworth the paradox is a virgo never lied to me while scorpio did in the past one scorpio girl was a great back stabber and our friendship turned to war nowadays when i hear someone is a scorpio i am ready to trust without worry maybe cuz the scorpio friends i've now are so loyal and trust worth and i like them a lot while when i hear someone is a virgo i feel so afraid and i feel like telling them they could not keep it i am a taurus and i usually trust people for some small matters to check their ability to keep a secret but i really do not have approach to the virgos not that i do not like them i just feel insecure around them wow you are that one girl who always takes the time to write really caring words about scorpios i've seen alot of postings on here of such by you you remind me of my best friend who is a taurus i love that girl w all my heart i think the reason why you would trust a scorpio more so than a virgo is that your relationship w a scorpio is so not surface it's beyond that where maybe the virgo will set you aside and treat you more business your scorpio friend regards you as family your problem is their problem and they will not bare to know that you are in need your scorpio friends are very lucky to have you as their friend i have always got on the best w all my taurus' buddies i appreciate their minds and views  Gundam W G-Unit: Last Outpost W.I.T.C.H.

what is your impression of a pisces woman what are the traits that stand out this lady is a master at getting what she wants from a man in and out of bed although pisces women are not as slow about moving on a relationship as their male counterparts they maintain that checklist of what they're looking for in a man the pisces women's needs are simple she wants a strong supportive and confident man whom she can spoil and surrender to fully with that philosophy the line forms at the left on the other hand the pisces career woman knows exactly what she wants out of life but needs companionship to make her feel complete the pisces woman has an ability to draw men right to her she's a soft spoken alluring gentle and caring water sign which makes the male species stand up and take notice and when the males start paying attention for the most part it's instantaneous of course they won't be able to pinpoint what the deal is it doesn't matter it's on  Astrological sign Dog Social rule Anal sex Gender role Pisces Volleyball Blackjack Force (Star Wars) Abortion debate W.I.T.C.H.

can taurus be as passionate and lustful as scorpio yes but it's a very different passion from my experience taurus is more traditionally lustful likes things more solid and romantic whereas the lust of a scorpio is more out there and daring if you find a scorpio that's very into trying new things in the bedroom he's right on target but finding a bull who does the same is a little bit more difficult with taurus it's more about showing love and concern  Astrological sign Love Scorpius General Hospital Enneagram Solar system in astrology Aphrodite Mithraism Zodiac British Rail Janus Taurus (manufacturer) Ruling planet Victor Hugo Zoophilia Homosexuality and Hinduism W.I.T.C.H.

do capricorn females and leo males get along as friends or lovers leo and capricorn on their first meeting capricorns see leos as confident generous and powerful someone to share success with leos see capricorns as quiet reserved and alluringly out of reach both signs have a passionate nature so there may be some sexual attraction between them but only once they get to know each other capricorns will see leos as extrovert and warm someone who will liven up their ordered lives leos find capricorns have a frivolous side which occasionally surfaces and helps to build a friendly bond between them when attracted to someone capricorns will not make up their minds quickly and don't enter into relationships easily as they are very cautious until they know where it's heading to them sex shows commitment and something not to be entered into lightly to leos sex is passionate and fun filled with as much enthusiasm as possible unfortunately the unemotional side of the capricorn will eventually dampen the leo ardour causing obvious problems also the leo enjoys the company of the opposite sex which the capricorn will find impossible to deal with capricorns want to master and leos want to be the centre of attention this combination is almost impossible but if both have the moon emotions needs more compatible signs this match can work if not it may be that the capricorn tries to dominate and control the leo completely and the leo will bite back resulting in the relationship turning into a power struggle this relationship will always be difficult but if they are prepared to work at it capricorns can learn to be less dominating and more self aware and leos can learn to appreciate a partner who has their best interest at heart  Astrological sign Human sexual behavior Love Polyamory Phoebe Halliwell Charmed Sexual orientation W.I.T.C.H.

help why do i have such bad luck with men born i have a pisces rising and a capricorn moon and i am the usual culprit when it comes to having problems in a certain area of life is saturn and its placement in the birth chart saturn's influence causes restrictions delays anxieties and difficulties i took a look at your birth chart and firstly you have saturn placed in the sign of scorpio the traditional planetary ruler of scorpio is mars the planet strongly linked to all things male this placement of saturn alone in a person's birth chart has the potential to cause difficulties and frustrations in relation to men women with this placement tend to feel anxious and uncomfortable around men and are highly suspicious of their motives however your natal venus which rules love and relationships also makes a stressful contact with saturn in your birth chart both men and women with this placement tend to be highly cautious and set very high standards when it comes to forming relationships it often takes them a long time to trust and warm up to someone they typically dislike frivolous and superficial affairs their love nature is serious and responsible what they typically seek is a committed relationship that will last a lifetime that is why people with venus saturn contacts tend to enter relationships and marry later than most people because they seek true quality in love and that is hard to find it requires immense patience however the good news is that saturn also rules endurance and stability consequently when people with a venus saturn contact ultimately find love it is often a love that is truly solid real and durable  Astrological sign Solar system in astrology House (astrology) Astrology Asperger syndrome Zodiac Birthday Western astrology Ruling planet Polyamory Cassini-Huygens Planet Gravity Eastern Orthodox Church Human sexual behavior Medical astrology Sexual orientation Alignment (role-playing games) Social rule History of astrology Autism Astrological aspect Education in the People's Republic of China Dead Like Me Transsexuality Infantilism Capricornus Anorexia nervosa Jupiter A Course In Miracles Second language acquisition Religion and sexuality Aphrodite Timeline of solar system exploration Equine conformation W.I.T.C.H.

i am a capricorn and often wandered how people or what people think of capricorns capricorns make the most faithful lovers and your strong sex drive makes you among the most reliable but perhaps the most defining characteristic of caps is that they are uniformly well equipped for material prosperity self discipline good time management skills thoroughness and ambition these are your trademarks and they conspire to make you an eager seeker of success your impeccable sense of timing enables you to seize opportunities and react to alarms you're at your best when you're building on your past and seeing your future come into focus perpetual forward motion turns you on when you finally get sufficiently situated to consider a relationship let your social consciousness guide you to potential love matches seek someone willing to care for you as well as you care for others someone who won't threaten your lifestyle and who is willing to be corralled into a secure relationship you don't take love lightly you play for keeps ever the practical purposeful pragmatist you choose your battles wisely you're always looking to what will advance your agenda and how to work smarter not harder you're willing to make sacrifices now in order to enjoy life later and that's why time is on your side you're not getting older you're getting better in so many ways you may hoe a lonely row but the fruits of your labor will come to fruition in a honey of a harvest some people think we are emotionless which is not true at all we just need to deal with people who can be patient with us  Consensus decision-making Infantilism Polyamory Alignment (role-playing games) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Strategic management Narcissism Human sexual behavior Chess strategy and tactics Meaning of life Religion Abortion debate BDSM Scientific method Transsexuality Sexual orientation John Howard Yoder Happiness Software engineering Leadership Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Second language acquisition Medicine Scientology beliefs and practices Taikyoku shogi Shaggy dog story Tank Modernism Goldstein's book Unemployment Vulcan (Star Trek) Hemp Sociocultural evolution Divine grace Democratic Party (United States) Baseball Existentialism Roman Catholic Church Surveillance Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Microeconomics Coercion Psychoanalysis Sant Thakar Singh Liberalism Maka dai dai shogi Health insurance Tai shogi Determinism Goodness and value theory Franz Boas Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)

does anyone have more detailed things about a aries plz aries the ram is the sign of the pioneer and warrior leader as the first sign of the zodiac arians cannot help putting themselves first though they are very affectionate and generous towards their loved ones they have warm and enthusiastic natures and can be extremely demonstrative gregarious sociable and extrovert arians are great people to have around as they are usually the life and soul of any party thanks to their enthusiastic natures sometimes however the arian face becomes creased with worry and disapproval when he or she is crossed in love the bright side the aries personality is fiery and warm passionate and self expressive with an urge to act now this is not a patient sign everything is done on impulse and with great urgency aries is a courageous leader likely to take risks and will usually feel i know best aries rarely hangs around to check out the details however give aries a good cause for which to fight a problem to solve or something to pioneer and this enterprising personality comes into its own forceful pioneering adventurous enterprising courageous direct energetic freedom loving self assertive the dark side strangely enough for this very active sign one of its main failings is procrastination aries is extremely impatient and intolerant of delay aries is likely to put off what must be done like bills and tax returns aries will resort to lies rather than be inconvenienced by the uninteresting or be forced to do that which they do not want to do arians can be blunt ignorantly offensive or employ bullying tactics to selfishly get their own way selfish unsubtle impulsive rash quick tempered impatient quarrelsome aggressive aries woman i am woman is her theme song she's modern excited driven spirited and courageous she uses the k i s s method keep it simple stupid while moving along her path she'll choose the path of least resistance with minimal obstacles drama or emotional overtures she's single minded in her pursuits and has a definitive plan to get to the place that she desires to be aries woman is usually blazing her own trail in her signature entrepreneurial pursuits it's seldom an aries woman will be working for anyone else except herself she has brains spunk and charm which she channels into success and independence this woman probably has more grit and gumption than you'll likely see in your lifetime she's born to lead and believe me she will she's incredibly intelligent and creative so if you plan on keeping up with miss aries you'd better have your act together she's capable of jazzing up her own daily routines so if you plan on entertaining her you'd better get creative aries woman certainly doesn't mind keeping life simple and sacrificing the little luxuries in order to attain her goals she will often involve herself in self denial and forego the usual feminine luxuries while pursuing her ambitions the aries woman is often called a man's woman because she is more at ease with men than women she'll do what men do go where men go and will never ask for a double standard when it comes to sex wooing and schmoozing are not required to draw out her desires she is out to satisfy her own strong sex drive with whom where and how she pleases with absolutely no apologies basically the aries woman sees man as a sex object and that's her final answer this woman has no flowery romantic and gushy sense of love because she really has no plans to fall in love actually this woman isn't trying to fall in love she's actually doing her best to avoid it all together she's looking for the perfect man who is rugged independent and who has minimal emotional needs the bottom line is she's looking for a man with a strong and healthy libido aries woman is typically attracted to men in uniforms especially military she's ruled by the planet mars so she's a warrior at heart she enjoys fast fun and furious adventure that's your queue to get even more creative  Narcissism God Emperor of Dune Human sexual behavior Happiness Arthur Schopenhauer Nicomachean Ethics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sexual orientation Asperger syndrome Objectivist philosophy W.I.T.C.H.

scorpio female and pisces female are we compatible my cousin wants to know please don't judge ok what about any controlling jealousy or fighting issues i'm going to take the easy way out on this but if you want personal experience then i'll give ya that but you'll have to message me to do it the drama inherent in these two signs could make for a very successful union as neither partner is consumed by or ruled by common sense all their actions are motivated by the intense emotional states they seem to stay in on a perpetual basis scorpio's adept manner at probing his her partner could enable the intricacies of pisces' secretive nature to be better understood by this sign than any other eventually scorpio will come to understand that applying pressure to pisces will not work but using persuasion could bring positive results scorpio may occasionally think of pisces as weak since the piscean nature is much less positive than scorpios and a lot more secretive and evasive at times the piscean popularity may also make scorpio jealous and resentful since scorpio cannot be as effortlessly charming as pisces in social situations should pisces' faults be pointed out too often this can lead to some dark depressions scorpio will need to control the critical nature that is always close to the surface scorpio will also have to manage the finances for dreamy pisces has a problem with looking at life realistically emotions are allowed to be dramatized and used in the bedroom to heighten sexual pleasure the loving attention that pisces shows scorpio is likely to calm the scorpions jealous nature and make for a happier relationship than most this is a match that is made in heaven how do you see pisces you can't wait to swim upstream with this romantic dreamer by your side but you fear that pisces is just too impractical for you how does your pisces partner see you as someone who can be unbelievably sensitive beneath the surface but is almost too intense in their approach to love and romance how to make things better never forget you do have that sensitive side to your nature pisces needs lots of love and support you can both use your psychic powers to understand each other more you are definitely a match made in heaven  Astrological sign Happiness Numerology Infantilism General Hospital Solar system in astrology Yoga Sutras of Patanjali W.I.T.C.H.

pisces i have a question for you what do you think of virgos virgo the virgin is the sign of the critic the technician virgo you may be shy introverted and self conscious on the surface but when love comes your way you relax and blossom virgos find it hard to express love they have a thoughtful approach and always look before they leap the bright side the virgo character is marked by a sharp intellect which is typically used to analyse the natural order virgos are methodical oh so precise and are attracted to only that knowledge that can be applied usefully they will happily share this information with anyone it confirms their own usefulness in the world and brings them eagerly out of there shells virgo pursues very how standards born out of realism and a tight grip on their environment rather than any chase of high ideals caution is a virgo trait which if used positively will give them a fine sense of discrimination between practical ideas and those to be left in the sky virgos will usually develop this skill to improve themselves and their surroundings as they place great pride in tangible achievements discriminating fastidious analytical meticulous modest precise the dark side in their urge to label organise and precisely understand all things in life virgo can become rather obsessed with the whole idea of order anything that upsets this harmony and understanding could expose them to the terrors of the unknown for virgos there is a place for everything and everything has its place virgo will do anything to achieve this state fussy self conscious cynical hypercritical finicky over conforming over cautious at times  Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Epistemology Meaning of life Philosophy Autism Critique of Pure Reason Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Dialectic Astrological sign Postmodernism Friedrich Schleiermacher Rudolf Hermann Lotze Scientific method Human Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Objectivist philosophy Strategic management Victor Cousin Philosophy of mathematics Logic Summa Theologiae Atheism Scientology beliefs and practices Intellectual property Sociocultural evolution Religion Philosophy of language Immortality Gundam W G-Unit: Last Outpost Second language acquisition Idealism Franz Boas A Course In Miracles Deconstruction Meme Consciousness Asperger syndrome John Wycliffe Sexual orientation ISO 9000 Nerd Psychology Archaeology Law of value Species Unconscious mind Infantilism Past teachings of Prem Rawat Science Goodness and value theory Immanuel Kant Supernatural Nationalism Quantum mechanics Computer chess Reality Moral relativism Meaning Animal cognition Soul Roman Catholic Church Solar Element Saga Iago Scientology Analytic philosophy Philosophy of science Artificial consciousness Noam Chomsky __tienne Bonnot de Condillac Enneagram Universal pragmatics Solar cell Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Charles Darwin's views on religion Animism Intelligence (trait) Romanticism Intelligent design Saint Seiya Origin belief The Book of Five Rings Leadership Cyberspace Frankfurt School Hypnosis Requirements analysis Nuclear weapon design Sudoku Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti

which of your friends changed the most throughout the years and what is his her sign i also realize that changing is a natural progression and that good fortune bad luck can change a person as well also what is your sign hi catwoman i really had to think about this and probably i'll think of another person later but the person who i'm thinking about now is a very very dear friend of mine she's a virgo i always seem to get on well with virgos and she really is typical of her sign she also seems to have some libra in her in that she finds it almost impossible to make a decison deliberates over things for a long long time sometimes misses chances because of this and sometimes finds it hard to motivate herself i've known her for around seven years now she's my best friend and she's this year and in those seven years she has become more independent often doing things apart from her husband because quite frankly their retirement isn't what she expected it to be when she became more adventurous he became the opposite he's a virgo too she will now make impulsive decisions such as when we all decided to go to canada together she had the holiday booked instantly which took me really by surprise and i praised her for it her husband has become more adventurous because we do a lot together as couples so that gets him out more my friend joins me and my daughters when we go off for weekend holidays and we have a lot of fun i think perhaps she has got influenced by their young and gregarious spirits her wonderful sense of humour often comes out now and it's just so wonderful to see a virgo and someone in her later years starting to enjoy life more and more thank you for the question it was nice to think this through polly  2000 Australian Grand Prix Birthday Nicomachean Ethics Social rule Theory of conduct Catwoman About a Boy Virgo Coming of Age (TNG episode) Consensus decision-making Jumpstart 3rd Grade Solar Element Saga Avenue Q Kender Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Shaggy dog story Pitaten Human nature Astrological sign Friedrich Schleiermacher Free will Evil Zodiac Incarnations of Immortality Piccolo Junior Saga K' The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Norway national football team God Emperor of Dune The Devil Wears Prada Merit Alcoholics Anonymous Supernatural Infantilism Time Out of Mind Radiohead Haven (TNG episode) Mojave people Objectivist philosophy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ranma __ characters The Lovely Bones Blood on the Tracks Transactional analysis Uzumaki Naruto Sleeping Murder The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders Kimi Finster Charles Darwin's views on religion Sharon Tate Eastern Orthodox Church Libra Urantia Goodness and value theory Christian eschatology Bernard Williams Numerology AFI 100 Years series Religious Society of Friends Have I Got News For You Situation comedy Aristotle Summa Theologiae Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Cliff Richard Friends Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Kodocha Victor Cousin Deconstruction Extreme Programming The Beggar's Opera Year of the Spider Scrooge McDuck The Adventures of Pete & Pete Garfield Oh My Goddess!

how do i find out what i am i know im an aquarius born on the cusp st jan and i was wondering how people find out about charts and what their zodiac says about them like saying im a leo with scorpian descendant what does that mean can any one help directly first of all a cusp is simply the point of transition from one thing to another while some reputable astrologers have done extensive study on the effects of cusp placement for the most part the meaning of cusp in relation to sun signs has been exploited by scam artists for one thing being born on the cusp does not mean you are part capricorn part aquarius your sun is either in aquarius or it is in capricorn it is not in both mathematically if you were born when the sun between degrees minutes of capricorn and degrees minutes of aquarius then you would truly be born on the cusp but even then you would still be either capricorn or aquarius when we consider that there are degrees in every sign and that the sun moves about degree every day about minutes every hour you can see that the period of time the sun is truly on the cusp of a sign is about minutes each month not or days because the sun mercury and venus tend to travel closely together however it is possible your sun is in aquarius and your mercury and venus are in capricorn which would imbue many capricornian qualities to you this is true for anyone born within days of the sun sign change thanks to computers and web sites like http www alabe com which has already been mentioned you no longer need to have a good command of math to enter the study of astrology but ultimately acquiring a mathematical understanding of the circle and base because minutes degree is going to help you immensely a leo with a scorpio descendant is better described as a leo with taurus rising a taurus ascendant depending on date time and place of birth this person probably has an aquarius m c medium coeli midheaven often the same thing as the th house cusp i e a leo d c th house for simplicity's sake let's say we're working in the middle degrees of the sun sign and the beginning degrees of the ascendant this leo's sun would be the th house in which family and home life are described this would be the man who first came up with the phrase a man's home is his castle protective and stubborn he would make a passionate if suspicious partner in love or business it's possible he may find pursuing his career at odds with maintaining a happy domestic front only knowing the sun sign of the chart in question because leo is ruled by the sun which is in the house of home family i'd say this person would sacrifice career for home anytime the conflict arose now let's look at your early aquarius perhaps late capricorn sun it rests right on the midheaven of this leo's chart based on this one thing it would be easy to imagine you represent some significant conflict to this person's home life simultaneously figuring prominently in the advancement of his career there are many many many other elements and aspects to consider before making any conclusive judgment but that perhaps gives you a glimpse of how this works  Horoscope Western astrology Chinese calendar Solar system in astrology Birthday The Twelve Labours Sabbat (neopaganism) Medical astrology Capricornus Chinese astrology Hipparchus (astronomer) Mithraism Aquarius Taurus (constellation) Solar system Leo Synthesizer Mercury (planet) Scorpius History of astrology Voynich manuscript Cancer (constellation) Natal chart Astronomy on Mars Mathematics Parallax Equinox Numerology Scientific method Tide Navigation Philosophy of language Second language acquisition Saint Seiya Moon Logic Libra Aries Ordinary differential equation Geometry Venus God Simone Weil Kumbh Mela Solar eclipse Extraterrestrial skies Longitude Supernatural Postmodernism Virgo Jon Secada Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Aristotle Dice Year Chess terminology Modular form New Age Filioque clause Philosophy of science Tonality Hindu calendar Sister Princess Bohemian Rhapsody UK Singles Chart 2 (number) Objectivist philosophy A Course In Miracles Tycho Brahe Babylonia World Wide Web Star of Bethlehem Epistemology Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn, & Jones, Ltd.

are virgos and capricorns compatibale virgo and capricorn capricorn is a superb lover for you dear virgo capricorn is an earth sign like yours so you relate on an intuitive level because so many of your values are the same such as in your career goals capricorn rules the natural th house of the horoscope the goat is focused on climbing the ladder of success and it is a rare capricorn that doesn't reach the top of his or her profession as a virgo you're a hard worker too measuring your productivity level at the end of every day your sign has been called the sign of discrimination you're known to be the universal critic but the one you are hardest on is always yourself try not to let work overpower all the other areas of your life with capricorn you both are so duty bound that you could forget your need for lighthearted fun including time in the bedroom because overwork could put a damper on your union you agree on many things such as how to spend and save money a nest egg is very important to both of you social approval is also important neither of you wants to get kicked out of the country club nor the bowling league rather you both want to find acceptance in the best possible circles so you can meet interesting successful people and be inspired by them this is particularly true of your lover capricorn works hard at networking with influential people neither of you would let the other down nor anyone else for that matter and the one thing that gets you crazy is when someone is irresponsible life is busy and when you cannot count on someone following through on a promise or a responsibility it shatters your trust in that person virgos and capricorns need to take people at face value you both believe this so happily there will be no problem on this score you both are practical solid citizens with good common sense something you have found isn't so common anymore your lover is ruled by saturn and therefore is not very emotional on the outside still because you are mercury's child you see beneath capricorn's cover and understand his or her feelings clearly virgos always have clear bright eyes that see through the veils of things like pride shyness or lack of confidence your lover will be deeply grateful for your understanding and your compassion your union will be a rich and mature one based on mutual caring and a shared vision of the future being earth signs you both will be willing to dig down to the buried treasures that lie within each other you both also have serious outlooks on life but your life together will not be boring or routine because your goals are lofty and inspired in bed because capricorn has established such trust in you you will be free to express your deepest feelings be reassured you will not be criticized or ridiculed while other lovers may have found one of you too reserved or shy you have none of these problems with one another both of you like to proceed slowly in the physical arena so neither of you is likely to hop into bed impetuously certainly not until you know one another well that careful slow build up of emotional intimacy is what will make your pairing so strong and sensual earth signs are deeply erotic once they feel love stirring within them so let it happen at its own pace the earth knows when it has reached critical mass once linked neither of you will feel the need to go back to singles mixers nor search any further for a mate earth signs mate for life their loyalty is strong only the most extreme conditions could cause you to pull apart once joined so let others complain that you both are too slow and careful making up your mind about whether to wed then laugh at them later when you celebrate your th wedding anniversary with your capricorn  Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Polyamory God Emperor of Dune Love Zoophilia Infantilism W.I.T.C.H.

sun in scorpio moon in aries rising in virgo mercury in scorpio venus in sagittarius mars in capricorn what would you assume about this personality sun in scorpio means very loyal person intelligent trust worth though sometimes vindictive when provoked in the wrong way and or when hurt making stinging comments when feels moody but actually never really want to hurt the people they care scorpios are really wise friends great to share stuff with understandable and they keep secret they will never disclose on no price sometimes scorpio people are aloof really and then me being a taurus start to worry if they do care though i know the answers is yes scorpio people do care but do not say it they show it with their actions moon in aries means dedication on own way to accomplish certain goals and also passionate about all aspects especially when in a relationship sometimes quick to get angry but because your rising is virgo that balance it out to think well before you react rising in virgo means intense and sensitive person paying a lot of attention to some details in life taking more time to choose the right way of achieving whatever that is previously planned virgo rising people are pragmatic but also very hard working and neat people mercury in scorpio gets characteristics of witty inventive intuitive and positive personality a person with venus in sagittarius is social friendly extroverted and fun to hang out with mars in capricorn people are working toward realistic and attainable goals and they are really hard working and achieving success trough a lot of energy and devotion overall i am not very sure about all the aspects of your chart but as a fan of the scorpio sun sign i think you should be very loyal fair responsible and serious person with a refined sense of humor  Solar system in astrology Zodiac House (astrology) Medical astrology Western astrology Ruling planet W.I.T.C.H.
