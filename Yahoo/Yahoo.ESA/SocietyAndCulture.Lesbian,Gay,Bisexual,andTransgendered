why are many gay men obsessed with getting rid of their body hair many gay guys that i know have spent time and money shaving waxing plucking and depilating their body hair even and to some especially their pubic bush they will trim it meticulously and some even shave them off completely it's a mystery to me oh i'm quite hairy myself and i don't bother with such niceties neither am i a grizzly just that i could never understand the obsession with hair or lack of it it's one thing to keep yourself well groomed but it's quite another to spend hours obliterating every hair on your body shaving your face is fine and so is grooming your pubes or underarm hair but i draw the line at men waxing their legs arms and chest unless they plan on becoming drag queens not that i wouldn't go out with them but some of them can be obsessed to the point of being anally retentive personally i do not understand gay people who shave their bodies i mean why are they doing this it is just natural for a man to be a bit or more than a bit hairy even if he is gay perhaps they simply want to separate themselves from hetero people by doing this but it is a very weak point since many heterosexuals shave their bodies as well i myself find a man attractive when he is a man and not a frog sorry but this is what i believe in anyway it is a mystery indeed perhaps it is just well some kind of fashion thing but spending time and money shaving waxing plucking their body hair wow they should work on their relationships instead of this no offence but if you want sex not your hairy ness is the major factor if you want a serious relationship not your hairy chest will count either so then why it is their decision however so i do not care but their choice is not my style long live the hairy men  Pubic hair Hair Gay slang Gender role Shaving Social role of hair Anal sex Human sexual behavior Leg shaving Sexual orientation Heterosexuality Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Homosexuality and transgender Puberty Friends Wig (hair) Aerial (dance move) Pedophilia Tarantula Waxing Physical attractiveness Swimsuit Baldness Effeminacy Moustache Transgender Bear community AIDS Gay Sex and the City Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Acomoclitism Age of consent Social rule Marriage Gay bathhouse Same-sex marriage Androgen insensitivity syndrome Zoophilia Crab louse Pornographic movie Razor Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Sexual attraction Homosexuality in Japan Polyamory Transsexuality Domestic violence Sexual dimorphism Avenue Q Eric Cartman Skinhead Vulva Chest hair BDSM Social psychology Biology and sexual orientation Lawrence v.

what do you think of this message i got from another user message personally i don't think anything you read or anything i could provide you with will change the way you are or the way you think you are the way you are and nothing anyone says will ever change it yes i am a christian but i don't believe in going around and trying to convert anyone to my way of thinking i happened to begin to think that being gay was wrong after subleting a room from lesebians i didn't know they were gay but even if i had i wouldn't had thought anything of it but i got a good inside look at their life style and how they treated each other and then how they treated me because i'm not gay i was called a 'breeder' and they were even pissed off because i shave my legs and arm pits and wear deodorant and make up and act like a decent human being most of what they said seemed insane to me and they just would not leave me alone and they always fought with each other they also made a huge issue out of sex and having sex and how they have sex and even brought out their toys to immitate having sex with in front of me the gays they brought over to visit were just like them and acted just as hostile towards me my dislike of homosexuals has nothing to do with being a christian it has everything to do with how they treat each other and how they treat those of us who arent gay this was from a mother i thought it sounded like she made the whole thing up myself i think this person should not stereotype the entire gay population based on a few people i know a lot of straight people who are rude i know a lot of people in straight relationships where the men are nothing but controlling and abusive toward their wives and think that it's the woman's job to obey her husband the way a child should obey their parents do i automatically assume all straight people and straight relationships are this way no everyone has their own personality sexuality doesn't have anything to do with attitude the only thing sexuality does is determine what gender they are attracted to it does kinda sound made up to me too but then you really would be amazed at some of the kinds of people there are in this world so there is a possibility she was telling the truth  Human sexual behavior Gender role Sexual orientation Ex-gay Homophobia Gay Homosexuality and transgender Friends Social rule Heterosexuality Religion and sexuality Theory of conduct Laura Schlessinger Little Britain Bisexuality Same-sex marriage The Smoking Room Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Gay slang Homosexuality and Christianity Anal sex Transsexuality Strap-on dildo Religion and sexual orientation Transgender Homosexuality Gay rights Domestic violence History of sex Theodicy Polyamory Marriage One Tree Hill (TV series) Gay bathhouse EastEnders Zoophilia Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Reparative therapy Recurring South Park characters Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith Toilet Homosexuality and Judaism Human sexuality Age of consent Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Lesbian Skinhead Gender-neutral language Married... with Children Aesthetic Realism Love Feminism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Anti-gay slogan Queer Male prostitute Herbert Garrison Sex Outing Asexuality Incest Sexism Kodocha Women in the Victorian era Condom Boston Public James Dobson Sex and the City Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Abortion debate The Marshall Mathers LP North American Man/Boy Love Association Childlove movement Germaine Greer Debugging Physical attractiveness Nudity Anglican views of homosexuality Mojave people Dog training Effeminacy Sexual attraction Philosophical skepticism Political correctness Group sex

how out is out enough i am struggling with the balance of how out to be part of me wants to tell the whole world and break down barriers and fly my queer flag proudly the other part of me thinks my sex life is nobody else's business unless they're involved in it to some extent it also feels like making an announcement about coming out just reinforces the differentness of being queer if i were straight i would never go out of my way to ensure that my co workers knew i like with women so how could i bring up liking men without making it seem like a big deal for now all my close friends know but i still haven't told my family as there has yet to be a male special someone to introduce them to standing on a street corner hold a foot tall sign saying i'm gay no really out is whatever you think it is who cares what someone else thinks you should do if you are not pretending to be straight while hiding a lover behind a closed door then you are out oh and as far as wearing something you have to explain at work i was a bit uncomfortable telling my boss when he asked what my pentacle was but hey it's my belief and what i am i just said it was a symbol of my faith and let him lead any other questions he had now he thinks it's cool and wants to go to lunch with me to learn more so you never know maybe someone will look you in the eye and say they are too  Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Gender role Social rule Friends Queer as Folk (U.S.) Human sexual behavior Shaggy dog story Sexual orientation The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sin City Kyle Broflovski Avenue Q Dead Like Me EastEnders Gay The Smoking Room Kill Bill Theory of conduct Queer Coming out Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Hide and Q (TNG episode) St. Elmo's Fire (film) Soap opera Scenes from a Memory The Shining (film) Homophobia Milton H.

could you give me your personal definition of what the word natural means there are so many times when certain straight people claim that homosexuality is immoral because it is not natural well i'd like to know what your idea of natural really is don't just paste a definition from a dictionary i want your idea of what natural means in a more personal sense chier say you applied your definition to animals even if there is a normal behavior and complementary atypical behavior couldn't both behaviors be considered to be natural nature is a very complex thing nuances are just as important as the bigger concepts say a star goes nova every so often in the galaxy if a star was to violate that general principle it may not be normal but it would still be natural normal does not necessarily mean natural hmmm that's a really interesting question natural to me means non synthetic not conjured up by anyone and it means normal or as normal as anything can get more healthy than unhealthy stemming from biology rather than from human manipulation  Sexual orientation Evil Homophobia Morality Theory of conduct Heterosexuality Goodness and value theory Altruism Science Logic Culture Philosophy of language Biology Gender role Religion and sexual orientation The nature of God in Western theology Abortion debate Human nature A New Kind of Science Objectivist philosophy Naturalistic fallacy Intelligent design Meaning of life Utilitarianism Causality Infantilism Black hole Free will Sociocultural evolution Atheism Quantum mechanics Property (ownership right) Mathematics Entropy Meme Moral objectivism Homosexuality and transgender Common sense Social psychology Human sexual behavior Asperger syndrome Cultural relativism Pedophilia Predestination Creation science G__del's incompleteness theorem Sociobiology Cyberspace Probability Philosophy Same-sex marriage Animism Supernatural Theodicy Coercion Infinity Conservatism Game theory Autism Species Epistemology Psychology Corporation Physics Art Language Transsexuality Anarcho-capitalism English grammar Postmodernism Biology and sexual orientation Eugenics Heteronormativity Traditional Chinese medicine Empathy Religion Falsifiability Willard Van Orman Quine Peter Singer Calculus Rape Organic farming Meaning Theology Philosophy of mathematics Intelligence (trait) Teleological argument A Course In Miracles Morphology (linguistics) Organic food Creation-evolution controversy Truth Psychosis Tai Chi Chuan Child sexual abuse

does this guy have a point so i saw this video on youtube and it made me think is it possible that just because you're a minority in this case gay that you aren't a jerk i'm not really trying to start crap but just wanting to see if anyone else see my point btw i'm a african american whose a bit of a libretarian i think that gays won't really be accepted until they can publically admit that their crap does indeed stink in other words i would like to see how many people think the nararrator in this case in a homophobe or if he has a point http www youtube com watch v mgd zozoyrk please watch the video and respond also no i don't hate gays pitbull fever catch it to zikiru despite what you said we actually agree also to elaborate popular culture has made gay guys the new cool thing every new sitcom has a gay character as does most literature with a modern day setting one of the reasons why gays are still on the outs is that almost always the gay characters are portrayed as being super nice guys they're never the jerk of the story and it they way pop culture embraces them i don't think gays will be fully accepted until they can accept themselves as real members of society and accept that some of them are jerks also to the guy that call me vice i hate dog fighting thank you for trying to judge me i hope you get the gout thanks vanilla sky you rock wow i first came on this and read all the posts and i was not going to watch the video but it sparked some curious george in me i watched it and i have never laughed so hard in my life i will be showing this to my girlfriend i may put this on myspace because i laughed that hard i am gay but i would never talk about that hit in public me and my girlfriend don't even hold hands in public because we have respect for people now keep in mind my girlfriend is obviously gay and even an old lady would have gaydar at that very moment but would never she be embarrassed by my girlfriends actions now i do know some jerks out there that are gay that's who they are now the only show that has a gay guy in it that is a complete is brian off of queer as folk but other than that i agree with you all of them are nice my shit stinks and so does my girlfriend we all can be pricks at one point of the day thanks for the good laugh have a good night  Avenue Q Gay George Costanza Social rule Homophobia Family Guy Theory of conduct The Catcher in the Rye Andrew Dice Clay The Ashlee Simpson Show Queer Megan Griffin Something Positive MTV The Contender (television series) Eric Cartman Time Out of Mind Humphrey Bogart Gay rights AFI 100 Years series South Park Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Queer as Folk (U.S.) Queer as Folk (UK) Craps EastEnders Friends Queer Eye for the Straight Guy Human sexual behavior Outing Singapore gay equality movement Ren and Stimpy Shit Plame affair Shaggy dog story Timeline of trends in music from the United States (1970-Present) Sharon Tate Happy Days The Critic Diana Ross Squidward Tentacles Kylie Minogue Kitsch Recurring South Park characters Coming out Kyle Broflovski 2004 Democratic National Convention Lesbian The Young Ones (TV series) Have I Got News For You Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In Gay slang Jeopardy! in culture American Psycho Paul W.

why are atheists so belligerent about their beliefs i just saw a woman with the american atheists complaining about having a moment of silence in school why is it her business whether or not someone is praying to themselves and who is she to take that moment away from anyone oops sorry about the category what does a moment of silence have anything to do with religion at all you can reflect on whatever you choose i agree with joe fox about the section i wouldn't have come across this question if you hadn't posted it to the people talking about the exclusion of certain kids since when were laws made with condsideration about ppls emotions if this was the case i imagine that the commercial industry might have been regulated for presenting ideals that give us teenagers negative self images anyway a moment of silence should by no means be considered an explicitly religious activity just because you are given the option to pray does not mean that anyone else has to how is it at all possible that a person praying in a public institution infringes on another person's rights giving someone this option in fact is respecting their freedom giving them the chance to think reflect pray stand and stare around whatever you want are we to eliminate respect of others views wait the ppl that do have views i think that exactly what you're pointing out is the question that if atheists have nothing to live for believe in what are they protecting themselves from if you really do believe in nothing then go about your life as if there is no danger in the world to protect yourself from just live and die 'fake' stuff can't hurt you let the church not dictate our laws but atheistic obsession should not attack belief either otherwise the religion of nonbelief is created ironic  Separation of church and state Status of religious freedom in France Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Abortion debate Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Religious conversion Same-sex marriage in Canada Atheism Theory of conduct Simone Weil A Course In Miracles Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Religion Theodicy Religious Society of Friends Objectivist philosophy Marriage Freedom of speech Ten Commandments Separation of church and state in the United States Constitution of Ireland Unitarian Universalism Alcoholics Anonymous The nature of God in Western theology Roe v.

are there any gay people who do not agree with gay marriage are there any other gay people that aren't totally for gay marriage i am gay but i'm not really pushing the whole marriage thing i am all for unions and i will not settle for anything but equal rights but marriage technically isn't the same right the law doesn't give you the right to marry the person you love just says to be able to marry someone of the opp sex y'know this is not really religious argument whether or not it started that way is another question but we're equal doesn't mean that things are exactly the same every once in a while it turns out we need different things anybody sigh i already have a feeling i'm gonna get eaten up for this one i'm catholic but even outside of that there are arguments well what i say to the separate but equal argument which i knew was only a matter of minutes away is this my opinion on the matter is that we don't really need the marriage separate but equal in case you didn't was proved unequal partly based on the experiments that were conducted by a black psychologist that asked children questions as to which doll they thought looked better was richer etc therefore the institution of education was unequal really in that you couldn't deny that these institutions were shoddy if we were able to actually make these institutions completely equal teachers buildings then but with civil unions and fully civil rights what is it that is unequal i think that this situation is more controllable than the situation of brown to troy that's what i mean by we don't need it sometimes pushing marriage explicitly sort of is an attempt to be just like the gay community forgive the fact that it's not fresh writing but i'm going to cut and paste my thoughts on this from my blog i consider myself to be moderate and invariably this will lead to some clashes in opinion with friends of mine i recently had a discussion with a friend who could not see how i could support civil unions and not gay marriage so consider this allegory i think this will work for many people as we all know religious freedom is guaranteed in the first amendment and a very large portion of our nation is christian so most folks celebrate christmas i know such risky statements so far suppose someone from a smaller religion comes in and wants their religious celebration recognized as 'christmas' maybe the costanzas decide to rename festivus to christmas they want to impose their definition of christmas upon the already existing one so that everyone would pretty much be nudged to recognize that christmas can be decorating a tree or touching a pole and sharing a list of grievances before pinning someone to declare the holiday over for the many christians what's the first reaction 'what no i'm not going to totally uproot my time honored tradition's definition to accomodate you ' we don't like feeling pushed around it's why atheists get so much flack for trying to get 'in god we trust' off of money feels like a superimposition of their religious views so now take that and apply it to 'marriage' a sacred time honored tradition is now going to have to be redefined what you've known and celebrated is now just not it's not the same this isn't even a prejudice more just an attachment to the way things are already defined i feel we should honor that but when i decide to consummate my union to a guy i expect all the same rights as a heterosexual couple i want no special treatment but i don't want any discrimination i want the same legal rights when my partner is hospitalized i want to be able to adopt children if found to be an acceptable parent measured by the same standards as a heterosexual i want to be able to make medical decisions for my partner if somehow i don't have a legal document drawn up for that specific decision i want the same taxation rights i want the same access to health care in short whatever a married couple has access to in terms of legal right i want a union to have the same that's why i love my state connecticut did about all it could it passed legislation to recognize civil unions while still defining marriage as between a man and a woman all we need is a national legislation that would protect gay rights while not infringing on the definition of marriage equal rights does not mean strongarming the same term a man and a woman are different but equal a gay couple and straight couple are different but equal no matter who we are we're all hopefully after the same thing unless we're being unreasonably selfish we want equal treatment and to not be strongarmed by someone else's beliefs or way of life the gay marriage debate isn't a hard one to decide for me i recognize what's important for both sides and i believe i can see what's fair  Homosexuality and Judaism Ethics Democracy Status of religious freedom in France French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Roe v.

seriously what is wrong with this country ok so of course there should be nothing wrong with being gay and etc i did a whole senior project about homophobia but now that i've broadened my horizons and fed more into the homosexual world now i must come to solve why it is that most gay males are so darn superficial not to mention fake or maybe its just my area but then again this comes from the general problem of stereotyping already being fat is defintely not what society makes it nowadays being feminem as a male doesn't make unacceptable and 'hot' guys really aint that hot when u dig past the looks but labels just cover the truth now i'm one to not go by what the world thinks or society rather i go more by a little thing called personality ive met some of the coolest so called dorks and fatties that no one seems to want why can't people uphold this notion of diversity and acceptance for all everyone's always talking about cuz hooking up preferences is more a privilege not a right right on i agree with that people need to stop assuming that they are being kind towards others when they are really racist and act like they own the world and shove everyone away like outcasts people need to realize that but sadly most of them don't mostly because of religion too  Homophobia Gay Sexual orientation Homosexuality and transgender Bisexuality Theory of conduct Gay rights Friends Human sexual behavior Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Transgender Religion and sexual orientation Avenue Q Transsexuality Homosexuality Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Asperger syndrome Little Britain Physical attractiveness Value system Racism Hate speech Aesthetic Realism Boston Public Gender role Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Abortion debate Simone Weil Marriage Same-sex marriage Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Separation of church and state Political correctness Social justice Characters from Arrested Development Religion and sexuality Religious Society of Friends The nature of God in Western theology EastEnders Jon Secada Evil Religion Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith Goodness and value theory Epistemology Utilitarianism Anderson Cooper Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Childlove movement Hip hop rivalries Garth Brooks Eric Cartman Alcoholics Anonymous Homosexuality in China Homosexuality and Christianity Reality Choice and sexual orientation Philosophy of language Homosexuality and Voodoo Ex-gay Postmodernism Jiddu Krishnamurti Michel Foucault Religious conversion Ethics Social rule Bertrand Russell Gay rights timeline Age disparity in sexual relationships BDSM Russian joke Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Outing Property (ownership right) Sin City Demographics of sexual orientation Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Biology and sexual orientation U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Joke The Ashlee Simpson Show Liberalism Nerd Generation X Democracy Discordianism Conservatism Cole Porter Ed, Edd n Eddy Atheism Homer Simpson Vernon Schillinger Transactional analysis Philosophy Rick Santorum Nigger Slander and libel

this question is directed especially for women but men welcome to participate i have noticed that their seems to be some controversy about how women and men adapt to the situaltion when retirement comes along and after so many years the two are together much more and some conflict can occur how have you found this to be in your marriage and is it a good or a negative thing to have so much shared time hmmm interesting question reminds me of the saying familiarity breeds contempt i think if people don't stay active after retirement then they could become bored and take that out on their partner plus the transition to retirement seems to be hard especially for professionals who had fulfilling challenging careers i think it depends on your personality too i can't imagine being completely retired i'd prefer to taper down my work to only working part time or doing a lot of volunteer work in my field of expertise overall i think it all depends on how you handle the transition to retirement i think it could be the best or worst thing for a marriage for someone who has used their job to escape from their marriage retirement will obviously be a nightmare  Sexual orientation Ethics Strap-on dildo Scientology beliefs and practices Social rule Human sexual behavior Extreme Programming Asperger syndrome Same-sex marriage EastEnders Genealogy Internet troll Age of consent Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Consensus decision-making Child sexuality Current teachings of Prem Rawat Divorce Tiger Woods Sociolinguistics Gospel of Mark Theory of conduct Ocean's Twelve Same-sex marriage in Canada Microeconomics Screenwriting Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses Transsexuality Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Gender role Habitat for Humanity International K' Jennifer Lopez Altruism Entropy Conscription Biology and sexual orientation The Brothers Karamazov Hiberno-English Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Garth Brooks Judith Miller (journalist) Anarchism and society Economic inequality Freeters Socrates Mediation Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Incarnations of Immortality Monogamy Archaeological field survey Infantilism Social psychology Nancy Witcher Astor Israeli Arab Make money fast Fight Club Karen Horney Supply and demand Paralegal Mathematics Polygamy The nature of God in Western theology Incest Republic (dialogue) Swinging Professor Retirement Transactional analysis Donald Rumsfeld Identity and change Polyamory Fathers' rights Traumatic incident reduction Leadership Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Minister of religion Ty Cobb Bulgarian language Interracial couple Anal sex Baseball Nicomachean Ethics Chuck Palahniuk Hacker Transgender God Emperor of Dune Ontological argument Marriage Gay Leviathan (book) Procrastination Feminist movement Norway national football team Pedophilia Single Transferable Vote Fantastic Four Sin City Same-sex marriage in the United States

do gay people choose their sexual orientation before any of you go on a huge rant hear mine first no you can't choose quite frankly i fail to understand how someone can claim you can ever heard of the term i chose to be gay the same day you chose to be straight and please explain how over animal species have also been found to have homosexual activity and why would someone want to be gay when they are heavily discriminated against by both society and their family please notice how all those who say that homosexuality is not a choice are profetionals who are qualified in their field of study and who are most likely to know what their talking about those who claim that it is a choice only have the bible to back up their argument and they have no psychiatric or scientific knowledge to prove it and yes there is no gay gene but they've found that there are several alleles that determine sexuality along with other features and don't use religion to say it is a choice it makes you look really stupid i see there are a lot of intelligent people here i would re post this in the religious section but i've heard what they have to say so many times now and its always the same thing it also anoys me because they fail to see how stupid their argument is even though its based on faith not fact obviously this does not apply to all religious people the clever ones realise that there are far more important things to focus on other than who some one fancies jesus taught about love and charity where does discriminate against all gays for no reason come in to this nowhere and yes i'd like to see a straight person try to be gay for a year or even a week and then they'd see how its not a choice good points no a person doesn't choose to be gay any more than they choose the color of their skin  Sexual orientation Religion and sexual orientation Homosexuality and Christianity Same-sex marriage Gay Homophobia Reparative therapy Religion Ex-gay Human sexual behavior Human Homosexuality Predestination Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Biology and sexual orientation Evil Homosexuality and transgender Ethics Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Gender role Ten Commandments Gay rights Church of Christ Separation of church and state Criticisms of Christianity Intelligent design Bisexuality Zoophilia Theory of conduct Anglican views of homosexuality Laura Schlessinger Coming out Economics Choice and sexual orientation Christian right Free will Existence of God Aesthetic Realism Theodicy Pedophilia Atheism Homosexuality and medical science Roman Catholic Church Religious conversion Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Rick Santorum Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Hate speech Lawrence v.

people's views on gay love i was watching according to jim yesterday w my grandma i do it for her lol i hate that show and it was an episode about gay guys and jim at the end of the epidsode jim says i hope they feel whatever gay men feel for eachother or something along those lines the episode didn't offend me i don't really get offended it got me thinking though do most straight people realize that gay people actually love eachother when they're in a relationship or do they just think its about sex i'm gay so i never have really thought about love from a heterosexual point of view or what they think of homosexuals' emotional love my view on gay love is that it's the same as straight love it's about being with the one that makes you happy the one that you would do anything for the one that makes your days brighter  Sexual orientation Homophobia Heterosexuality Human sexual behavior Bisexuality Homosexuality Ex-gay Gay Friends Pedophilia Homosexuality and transgender Religion and sexual orientation Gay rights Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Laura Schlessinger Queer Eye for the Straight Guy Marriage Gender role Queer Homosexuality and Christianity Religion and sexuality Transgender Anal sex Homosexuality and Hinduism Gay slang Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Ren and Stimpy Male prostitute Queer as Folk (U.S.) Will & Grace Little Britain Reparative therapy Herbert Garrison Homosexuality in Japan Phoebe Buffay's songs Avenue Q EastEnders SpongeBob SquarePants Recurring South Park characters American Psycho The Ashlee Simpson Show North American Man/Boy Love Association Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith Coming out Lesbian Same-sex marriage Playing it Straight Married... with Children Domestic violence Butters Stotch Homosexuality and Neopaganism Biology and sexual orientation Age of consent Zoophilia Transsexuality Brideshead Revisited Child sexual abuse Gay bathhouse Sex and the City Andrew Sullivan James Dobson Aesthetic Realism Anti-gay slogan Homosexuality and Scientology Child sexuality Homosexuality in China Choice and sexual orientation Effeminacy Homosexuality and Judaism Polyamory Homosexuality and Islam Friendship LGBT Heteronormativity Pederasty Sex education Singapore gay equality movement Childlove movement Transvestism Outing Dating game show Boston Public The Fairly OddParents Pure Pwnage Jumping the shark Kyle Broflovski Yuri (animation) Cruising (film) History of sex Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Jon Secada Batman Eric Cartman Family First Party Demographics of sexual orientation South Park Slash fiction Ruth Warrick

can guys have a child i'm wondering if i remove the nucleus of egg cells then let the sperm from one male fertilize one egg cell then the sperm of the other male fertilize the other egg cell then we fuse the eggs wouldn't it be possible to produce an offspring i understand that the risk off yy chromosome will occur if the sperms are selected by chance please explain why this producing an offspring from males isn't possible i have read that it is possible that eggs from women can be fused by an electrical impulse resulting a daughter child i am wondering why can't we remove the nucleus of the eggs then replace it with the genetic material from the sperm then we electricute the eggs so that the eggs would fuse what you are suggesting sounds like it could produce a chimera of sorts or fraternal twins well it seems to me that what you'd do would be to first take an egg cell then you find a female sperm cell you'd replace the nuclear dna of the egg with the x sperm's dna now a problem this could pose would be nuclear mitochondrial incompatibility so you'd probably have to replace the mitochondrial dna as well in the egg cell it is out in the cytoplasm in the sperm cell i believe that is out in the tail somewhere then you can take a sperm cell of the other partner and use it to fertilize the reconstructed egg if nothing happens it may require some sort of electrical stimulation to get the cells to divide then what you do is implant the embryo or zygote into a surrogate mother  In vitro fertilisation Meiosis Chimera (genetics) DNA Spermatozoon Human cloning Cloning Sexual reproduction Ovum Infertility Mitosis Cell (biology) Mitochondrial genetics Mitochondrial DNA Parthenogenesis Fertilisation Stem cell X chromosome Reproduction Intersexuality Mitochondrion Alternation of generations DNA repair Pregnancy Apoptosis Morphogenesis Multiple birth Cell nucleus Birth control Biology and sexual orientation Prostate cancer Ploidy Abortion debate Chlorophyta Cell growth Drosophila melanogaster Species Cephalic disorder Puberty Flowering plant Cancer Platypus Sexual differentiation Patau syndrome Huntington's disease Menstrual cycle Ovary Francis Crick Eukaryote Sexual intercourse Cellular differentiation Senescence Emergency contraception Transformation (genetics) Jurassic Park Edward's syndrome Color blindness Genome Miscarriage Sex Xenomorph Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Non-coding RNA Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Androgen Chromosome Animal Mutation Human genome Ovulation Human Y chromosome Motility Intersex surgery Plant breeding Spider Orgasm Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Male reproductive system (human) Genetic disorder Homosexuality and medical science Bird Genetically modified organism Obstetrics Nuclear fusion Parkinson's disease Genetics Fetal development Biological life cycle

how do you feel about gay leaders in the boy scouts do you feel that the majority rules when it comes to this issue or do you feel that they gays should be allowed the right to be a leader even if it makes many parents uncomfortable also what reason would a gay man want for being a scout leader anyway knowing that he is making many parents uncomfortable i have no opinion really on this issue as i'm not faced with this dilemma tammy i think if my son was in the boy scouts i would not feel uncomfortable with a gay leader as long as he doesn't have some police record for you know what and especially if the person in question has a background in education or something similar then i'd understand his interest in the boy scouts i can honestly say i did cub scouts and worked my way up to boy scouts where i earned my eagle and silver palm i was an assistant scoutmaster a camp counselor i taught jltc probably times and went to all sorts of camps including philmont at the time i was lying to myself about my sexuality but when i came out and was still in boy scouts you know what changed absolutely nothing but i knew how much i was basically hated for realizing the truth about myself shortly after that i bailed from the program because if you are found out they red line you i think that's the term i was told my family was still really big into the program so that's why i bailed i didn't want to embarrass them in the bsa the funny thing after that was that i worked as an employee at their store selling uniforming i couldn't believe how many gay leaders men and women would come in and buy things how many gay parents would come in and buy things for their children how many gay guys would come in and buy their own uniforming and stuff there are so many gay people in scouting it's funny we are so hated by them but if they'd open their eyes the bsa would realize how gay their organization really is and that there are so many gay people in the program and as leaders honestly i would have no problem sending my child to scout camp with a straight or gay leader  Boy Scouts of America Scouting Venturing (BSA) Order of the Arrow Philmont Scout Ranch Boy Scouts of America v.

how why would the glbt be so forgiving i see some of these horrid questions i'd like to take a baseball bat to these bigots granted i'm not a forgiving person i'm not gay but i can't forgive their hate how can you humans are prone to all emotions and many live only by them forgetting that they have a brain to override basic animal instincts true sometimes i would love to weild that bat i don't consider myself above anyone but i try to claim some enlightenment to the base human element and that is love from love comes kindness and forgiveness and words are just words if someone tried to attack me physically i would defend myself and if someone physically hurt someone i love that bat would be in my hand among other weapons and it would take alot of force to stay my hand the tongue may gouge the psyche but the strong soul knows better that words are just words yes it is a battle everyday for some that which does not kill you makes you stronger just a thought  Soul Love Human EastEnders Sin Emotion Dualism (philosophy of mind) John Berryman A Course In Miracles Consciousness John Howard Yoder Human nature Meaning of life Summa Theologiae Psychology Dog Infant baptism Jewish principles of faith Hulk (comics) Roman Catholic Church Jon Secada Free will Mahou Sentai Magiranger Baseball Vegeta Forgiveness Lataif-e-sitta Abortion debate Rave Master Simone Weil Unconscious mind Martial art Samurai Deeper Kyo Immortality Theory of conduct Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Ranma __ characters Franz Boas Numerology Trinity Mnemonic David Hume Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Structuralism Age of Enlightenment LGBT Salvation Chakra Reincarnation Anger management Theodicy Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Gay Stoicism Novel Angel (vampire) Sufism Homunculi of Fullmetal Alchemist FLCL Religion InuYasha (character) Goldstein's book American Psycho Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Heterosexuality The Death Gate Cycle StarCraft Episode VI Concepts in the Wheel of Time series Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Narcissism Sesshomaru Beast Wars Gorgias Homosexuality and Judaism The Amber Spyglass YuYu Hakusho Lightsaber combat Urantia Happiness Homophobia Determinism Altruism Blood II: The Chosen Freedom of speech Slander and libel Motivation Christianity BloodRayne Meat Loaf Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Aikido Klingon Marvin Gaye Alignment (role-playing games) Borderline personality disorder Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Hyakujuu Sentai GaoRanger Wolfrider

am i getting over it sometimes i love her so much but other times i really don't like her at all i know that i'm never going to be good enough for her there are times when i just look at her and ask myself how do i like her am i getting over her it sounds like there's a battle going on between your rational mind and your irrational heart in your mind you may know that you shouldn't can't don't want to don't know the situation but your emotional side is still fixated on her and there's not all that much that you can do to stop that from personal experience i'd say that the only thing to do if you do want to get over her is to wait it's unlikely that you'l fall out of love very quickly because it takes time for such a powerful emotion to fade and be displaced i hope you can work it all out x  Epistemology Infantilism Social rule Obsessive-compulsive disorder Time Out of Mind Sigmund Freud Emotions (album) Jon Secada Emotional intelligence Traumatic incident reduction Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy Modernism Altruism Dog training Narcissism Dualism (philosophy of mind) Transactional analysis Psychoanalysis Moral objectivism Shaggy dog story Objectivist philosophy Homophobia Tina Turner Immanuel Kant Spice Girls Theodicy The McGuire Sisters Irrational number Human Real Love (song) Lord of Light The Isley Brothers Mind Love Another Side of Bob Dylan Freddy Fender Treehouse of Horror V Carl Jung Milton H.

is it disrespectful for straight people to tell gay people they have chosen to be gay i don't get that unless you are in that person's head and have experienced their life what gives them the right that is so incredibly arrogant and patronizing to the gay community i am quite perplexed i need answers mzbrown you are ghetto therefore dismissed yes very disrespectful thoughtless and ridiculous as well the reason they want to say this i think is because they don't want to allow that anyone can be gay from birth or for any other reason beyond his her control and thus have to admit that homosexuality is natural the religious right seems to push the argument that homosexuality is a choice to avoid god receiving credit or blame for homosexuality sorry but if god created the world and everything in it he did create homosexuals because he knew exactly everything that would ever exist in the world before he ever created it so he knew that there would be homosexuals and therefore he created homosexuals if i plant seeds and a plant grows then i'm responsible for creating that plant you can't say that god created everything and then say that he didn't create some things doesn't make any sense whatsoever the other side of the choice coin is that if homosexuality is a choice then homosexuality is the fault of the homosexual hence the person who says homosexuality is a choice has in his her mind absolved god of any responsibility absolved nature of any part and laid the blame entirely on the homosexual who in their opinion has made this decision because of their evil and depraved nature that's the whole thing in a nutshell blame the whole thing on the homosexual why they find that necessary is another question i suppose i agree with the people who comment that the proper response to this is so you're telling me that you have been attracted to members of your own sex because if you say you could never be attracted then how can it be a choice how can you tell me that i had this choice if you have never had to choose i firmly believe that about of homophobia has its roots in men wanting to shore up their own heterosexuality at the expense of homosexuals and what that means of course is that their own heterosexuality is open to question in their own minds if it didn't mean that they wouldn't have to go out and make such a big deal about how manly and virtuous they are that the arguments and statements they make are illogical and contradictory highlights that it's their fear that's motivating them  Sexual orientation Homophobia Homosexuality and Christianity Theodicy Theory of conduct Gay Ex-gay Heterosexuality Human sexual behavior Homosexuality and Judaism Homosexuality and transgender Rick Santorum Bisexuality Same-sex marriage Transsexuality Marriage Religion and sexual orientation Reparative therapy Laura Schlessinger Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith Federal Marriage Amendment Religion Biology and sexual orientation Phaedo Gay rights Epistemology Supernatural Homosexuality Evil Transgender Simone Weil Lawrence v.

calling all lgbt people what if there was a gay religion okay hear me out i just thought of this and i'm wondering if it'll work because we have freedom of religion in the constitution people are allowed to join or create any religion they want without being treated differently under law christian religions have the right to legally marry one man and one woman because its part of their religion just like in the us muslims and mormons are legally allowed the right to polygamy marriage of one man with more than one woman eg the husband has wives at once they're allowed to do this legally because its part of their religion and under the constitution its their right does that mean that if i was to start a religion that allowed both marriage between a man and a woman and same sex marriage they would also have to give that religion the right to legally preform the marriage even if it does mean giving gays the right to marriage after all denying it would be unconstitutional and illegal would this work i believe you have to have members to be legally recognized as a religion you shouldn't have any problem getting them though you would have to set the rules of the church which should allow no hate for anyone and that all would be welcome to the church which i believe is standard till bush started the gay hate thing  Marriage Same-sex marriage Polygamy Same-sex marriage in Canada Gay rights Same-sex marriage in the United States Religion and sexuality Defense of Marriage Act Separation of church and state Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Israeli Arab Civil union Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Federal Marriage Amendment History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Lawrence v.

the nature of marriage i have a multi pronged question about the nature of marriage what is your definition of marriage do you think that marriage has always been the same way or has it changed if so then how has it changed if gay marriage was legalized in the us how would it affect heterosexual married couples and potential heterosexual couples don't just say it won't tell me why not i think that marrage is a relgious thing and partnership the legal side of it is something everyone should have dont think this means im agaist gay marrage im not but why would i want to get married in a church where the priest dont want me there if i get married i want to do it in an inclusive church so therefore i think marrage is something everyone can attain from any relgious congeragation christian muslim hindi in a group where the leader is ok with it as for has marrage changed over time yea it has greatly in fact its only in last century that the major changes have come about before marrage was a way on ensuring a women was essensally sold from a father to another man women were treated as propertie so if peeps give bull about marrage being accient and sacred just remind them thats it changed a hell of alot in the last years as for how in the us it would affect hetrosexual married couples the only affect would be a billion dollar boast to the economy acording to some experts so there will be an economic impact but as for the other stuff they fear in other countries to date canada spain other places with civil partnerships uk etc there has yet to be any negative side effects or any effect hetrosexual married life as of yet so from that currently the conclusion would be there is only postive improvement and no visable negative regarding the effect on peoples lives  Marriage Same-sex marriage Same-sex marriage in Canada Gay rights Federal Marriage Amendment Civil union Sexual orientation Homosexuality Same-sex marriage in the United States Polyamory Religion and sexuality Same-sex marriage timeline Human sexual behavior Religion and sexual orientation Civil unions in the United Kingdom Homosexuality and Judaism Homosexuality and transgender Homosexuality and Christianity Clerical celibacy Coercion Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Laura Schlessinger Heterosexuality Same-sex marriage in Spain Homophobia Inflation Ten Commandments Roman Catholic Church Supernatural Pharisees Gay rights timeline Defense of Marriage Act Intellectual property Polygamy Age of consent Huldrych Zwingli Lawrence v.

what's the difference between civil union and marriage also does a civil union provide equality or is it a just another way of masking discrimination i think it is just a difference in the rights that we cant share with our partner unfortunatly my partner and myself we live in ny have given up the thought of a marriage and refuse to have a civil union as we think that would be accepting the crumbs the government is throwing us again allowing the government to think that we are so desperate for acceptance that we will accept whatever they feel like giving and they are soooo wrong kind of a silent protest it is def in a way masking discrimination  Same-sex marriage in Canada Same-sex marriage Civil union Gay rights Civil rights Racism European Convention on Human Rights Fathers' rights Discrimination Federal Marriage Amendment American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Civil unions in Ireland Domestic partnerships in California Divorce Irish Republicanism Homophobia Same-sex marriage timeline Marriage Jewish view of marriage Mahatma Gandhi Civil unions in the United Kingdom Homosexuality Separation of church and state Liberalism History of South Africa in the apartheid era Centre Party (Germany) Gay rights timeline Sexual orientation Unionists (Ireland) Equal Protection Clause Common-law marriage Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Same-sex marriage in the United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Racial segregation Supreme Court of the United States Sinn F__in American liberalism Democratic Party (United States) Homosexuality and Christianity Reconstruction Affirmative action Polygamy Trade union Defense of Marriage Act Feminism French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools NAACP Patriotism Polyamory Libertarian views of rights Birth control Speciesism Constitution of Japan Same-sex marriage in Alberta Brown v.

i didn't like girls when i was little does this mean i was gay little children are really raised asexualized while at the same time masculinizing and feminizing them parents really don't want their children to know much about sexuality as it would in their minds make them want to have sex at an early age if they did therefore parents create this divisional game between the sexes such as boys are yucky and girls have cooties etc that ward off any sexualiztion thus i would say you didn't like girls due to this socialization what happened when you hit puberty is a different story hormones then start exaggerating your desires and then you know what you really like  Transsexuality Gender role Puberty Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sexual differentiation Sex History of intersex surgery Child sexuality Asexuality Intersex surgery Sex assignment Homosexuality and transgender Pedophilia Biology and sexual orientation John Money Girl Human sexuality Feminism Childlove movement Intersexuality Effeminacy Child Sexual orientation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Delayed puberty Sexual identity Adolescence Gay slang Marriage Transgender Heterosexuality Reproduction Homosexuality Hentai Gender Infantilism Masculism Age of consent Lesbian Heteronormativity David Reimer Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Cross-dressing Sex education History of sex Prostitution Same-sex marriage Prostitution of children Statutory rape Human sexual behavior Sex-positive feminism Castration Micropenis Adoption Child sexual abuse Sex in science fiction Sex and the City Feral child Testosterone Gender of rearing Cybersex Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Woman Parthenogenesis Ex-gay Child abuse Nudity Sadism and masochism Homophobia Little Britain Penis envy Germaine Greer Gender identity disorder The Catcher in the Rye Sex reassignment surgery Gay Sexual attraction The Handmaid's Tale Sexual abstinence Yuri (animation) Nip/Tuck Child pornography Sigmund Freud Recurring South Park characters Mary Wollstonecraft Camille Paglia Queer Motivation Pubic hair Butch and femme Sexual fetishism Kylie Minogue Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Human penis size Herbert Garrison Male prostitute Feminist movement Evolution of sex Secondary sex characteristic

advice please my wife hates her job not because of what she does but because of her hours she works pm to am days on days off days on days off and the hours are really starting to get to her so i told her like any good wife would to start job hunting so she has and has two job prospects one with my old employer for significantly less money than she is making now but it's something she wants to do in the healthcare industry the other is with a major corporation doing a job similar to what she does now but with better hours the money would be comparable to what she makes and the benefits are phenomenal i am a paper chaser so i say go where the money is good you can go to school to get the education you want for the healthcare in the field you want and we won't have to take a break in pay i know job happiness is important however this would put a significant difference in our income and we are trying to move and have a baby i don't want to be selfish gareth ignore the thumbs down ron we have a civil union so all companies in our state are supposed to offer benefits to us but as we can see in nj that's not always true but as far as i know they do also the second job opportuntity which offers comparable money also has better hours so i'm not asking her to keep working those hours that's not to you specifically ron that's just an fyi oh and i almost forgot smooches to you chef xxxxxoooxx i don't think you're being selfish rather your being realistic and pragmatic whilst job satisfaction is a key factor in choosing a new job it is important to think about the financial situation none of us would ever say that the reason we want a job in a job interview was because we wanted the money but it's what we are all thinking about money doesn't make the world go round but it sure makes life easier what i think you should do is sit down with your wife and discuss the financial implications of each job as well as the other pro's and con's but don't expect her to take on too much at once changing jobs moving house and having a baby adds a lot of emotional strain onto someone whether they have someone to share it with or not i think you need to decide which is the most important first and do them all in a gradual process ultimately i do think it has to be your wife's decision as to which job she goes for because she is the one who has to do that job i wish you luck with it edit oh my i got a thumbs down for giving some good advice sheesh thanks  Microeconomics Economic inequality Friends Poker jargon Breastfeeding Economics EastEnders Altruism The Amazing Race Theory of conduct Capitalism Publicly funded medicine Divorce Wal-Mart Plame affair Graduate school 401(k) Craps Charles Dickens Gross domestic product Inflation Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Insurance Labour economics Life insurance Objectivist philosophy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Free trade Extreme Programming Politics of Canada Health insurance Tax Arturo Frondizi Goodness and value theory FairTax Trade union Blackjack Law of value Milton H.

why so many questions about if someone is gay or not i see these questions all the time really when it comes down to it what business is it of yours and who really cares i know that people think that if there are more of us that are visable the better it can make the cause of acceptance but it can also damage what those persons have worked their lives for and furthermore do str people actually think that we ''gays'' know each other that is a twist on an old racist stereotype tell me what you think to you are stereotyping what a person can wear and what they can not and by doing this that shows ignorance i get sensitive about this because it's insulting to the lgbt community like i stated asking us is just a twist to an old racist stereotype period where there is racism there is ignorance i freaking agree who cares there's more important and more fun things to talk about than who someone boinks and i guess they might think we all know each other it's like the six gay degrees of separation hey straight people we are a tenth the size of you not a millionth there are too many of us all of us look alike chuckle star for you baby  LGBT Sexual orientation Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Homosexuality and transgender Nigger Joke Transsexuality White trash Skinhead Gender role Bisexuality Drag queen Eric Cartman Avenue Q Kyle Broflovski Anal sex Gay slang Little Britain Social rule Queer Calvin and Hobbes Big Brother (USA TV series) Vernon Schillinger Recurring South Park characters Media and ethnicity Soap opera Whose Line Is It Anyway?

do two wrongs make a right i have always been told that wrongs do not make a right but according to an article i recently read online in the baptist press if it isn't right it is at least better in a story discussing an ex gay they say although glatze's new religion of mormonism denies essential elements of christianity his story of leaving homosexuality is nonetheless significant http www sbcbaptistpress org bpnews asp id if his conversion to mormonism denies essential elements of christianity in their eyes he must still be going to hell i do not see why they are so happy about this can anyone clear this up for me am i missing something or do they just have an anti gay agenda where anything bad for gays is good for christianity no dearest i don't think you're missing the point i think that glatze missed the point instead of confessing up to his drug usage and party animal lifestyle it seems that he and the church allowed the full blame to be laid right on his homosexuality rather than his substance abuse you didn't miss a thing you hit it right on the head which might not be a bad idea for those who wrote that article naughty naughty me  Ex-gay Church of Christ Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Mormonism and Christianity Mormon Criticism of Mormonism Book of Mormon Christianity Theory of conduct Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Baptism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Anti-Mormonism Anti-gay slogan Jerry Falwell Homosexuality and Christianity Bill O'Reilly (commentator) EastEnders Roman Catholic Church Family First Party Christian right Curse and mark of Cain Evil Homosexuality Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Bisexuality Sexual orientation Rick Santorum Avenue Q Laura Schlessinger Religion and sexual orientation Zoophilia Great Apostasy Christian eschatology Same-sex marriage Vernon Schillinger Pope Benedict XVI Charles Grandison Finney Sabbath Denis Law Criticisms of Christianity Calvinism Eucharist Heaven Same-sex marriage in Canada Marriage God Homophobia Orson Scott Card Sun Myung Moon Merit Mormonism Holy Orders History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints History of the Latter Day Saint movement Biblical canon Original sin Pitaten Separation of church and state Reparative therapy Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Ethics Homosexuality and Judaism Martin Luther Gay rights William A.

heh interesting thought this is just for fun but its a cool thought ok if homosexuality is a natural response to over population like some claim it to be then wouldn't it be safe to say that the numbers of homosexuals will be greatly increased in near future how cool would that be please weigh in that is a very logical way to look at that hypothesis the numbers probably wouldn't need to increase by much to have an effect after all one man can theoretically fertilize many many eggs a lot of lesbians are having kids the only group not having kids is gay men for obvious reasons but even they are using surrogate mothers and adoptions as far as the numbers increasing i think they are the old saying goes there's power in numbers or something like that  Biology and sexual orientation Homosexuality Nuclear power Sexual orientation Religion and sexual orientation Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Gay Homophobia Theory of conduct Homosexuality and Judaism Same-sex marriage Human sexual behavior Gender role Scientific method Theodicy Ex-gay Anal sex Feminism Gay bathhouse Transsexuality Married... with Children LGBT Friends Gay rights Reparative therapy Childfree Philosophy of language Marriage History of gays in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust Pedophilia Birth control Religion and sexuality Liberalism Laura Schlessinger Anglican views of homosexuality Singapore gay equality movement Section 28 Transvestism Ozone depletion Karl Popper Homosexuality and transgender South Park Homosexuality and Christianity Gay rights timeline Same-sex marriage in Canada Recurring South Park characters Nazism North American Man/Boy Love Association One-time characters from The Simpsons About a Boy Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Philosophical skepticism Abortion debate Homosexuality in Singapore Species Logic Duesberg hypothesis Don't ask, don't tell Paragraph 175 Ozone hole Little Britain Omega-3 fatty acid Effeminacy Mathematics Romer v.

does this make me bi i always have only ever liked guys and have never thought of being attracted to a female but i realised that i kinda have a crush on one girl and i dont think id wanna go out with her and thinking of anything sexually with her doesnt turn me on or anything i only like her cos shes really pretty and im physically attracted to her ive never felt this way before for a girl and its not the same as liking a guy i dont like her as much as i do for guys i can imagine kissing her and stuff but id never do anything sexual maybe its just a phase i dont know but does this make me bi or curious or not i would say you might possibly be curious but since the idea of anything sexual or a relationship doesn't appeal to you then you're probably not bisexual it's natural for women to notice other women that they think are physically attractive that doesn't make you bisexual or gay it's just the way we are some women even have the desire to kiss another woman even though it would never go any further than that i'd say it's all admiration and curiousity good luck finding yourself  Sexual orientation Friends Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Bisexuality Lesbian Gender role Heterosexuality Transgender Human sexual behavior Child sexuality Homosexuality and Christianity Homophobia Reparative therapy Gay slang Zoophilia Pedophilia Infantilism The Ashlee Simpson Show EastEnders Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sexual attraction Phoebe Buffay's songs Britney Spears Bi-curious Sexuality in Christian demonology Eric Cartman Homosexuality Dead Like Me Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Swinging Physical attractiveness Avenue Q Kurt Cobain Yuri (animation) Revolutionary Girl Utena Stewie Griffin Coming out Pederasty Ginny Weasley Humphrey Bogart Little Britain Biology and sexual orientation Love Human sexuality Cybersex History of sex Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) Harem anime Transsexuality Hentai Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Cliff Richard Domestic violence Something Positive The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Asexuality Homosexuality and transgender Anal sex Sexual abstinence Transwoman Ron Weasley Sex and the City Sexual revolution Undergrads Characters from Arrested Development Sex-positive feminism Kodocha The Smoking Room Christina Aguilera Herbert Garrison Miss Saigon Narcissism Maison Ikkoku Ultra Maniac Kylie Minogue Oh My Goddess!

prferring to be alone mostly is it strange for a man years to prefer to spend his life alone my first relationship was a man i was it was ok for a bit but he drank alot alot had a temper and would ignore me for days walking right by and not a word we fought so much and booze didn't help each other emoy tinally my second was long distance i was he was and a mean drunk loved to play games while drunk he admitted he was using me because he can't get the guys he wants whoaa i walked awy from him and never looked back the rd and last was an ex married guy with kids we had mothing in common except sex and after several fights and him seeing others i said why do you come around he said you know that was that my family life was riddled with drug problems really stressed me out im anxious as is so now at i feel i need to give to me in the past off and on years i have taken trips to new england and pa with a plantonic friend wanna go again but no romances it sounds like you have had lots of hard times with relationships i am sorry that the guys you have dated had problems with alcohol and or drugs it is possible to find someone out there in the world who doesn't do those things at this point anyone who is into this kind of behaviour should be at the bottom of your dating list i would recommend you to just try to enjoy life as it comes and to try and make friends with people you may also ask yourself why you allowed yourself to get involved with those kinds of guys was it low self esteem no other prospects or a genuine interest in the person whatever the answer to your question try to figure it out because that will help you to know yourself better and to make choices against the kinds you have made in the past i would also recommend just getting on match com and trying to make friends that way all good relationships start with a real chemistry between two people people who could be friends just as easily as lovers  Humphrey Bogart Human sexual behavior Theory of conduct Social rule The Ashlee Simpson Show Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) Maison Ikkoku Sex and the City Liam Gallagher Time Out of Mind About a Boy Nicomachean Ethics The Smoking Room Transactional analysis Pitaten Avenue Q EastEnders Alcoholic beverage BDSM Little Britain Alcoholics Anonymous Rape Infantilism Boston Public Microeconomics Days of our Lives Expert system Dead Like Me Poker jargon Sant Thakar Singh The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Sexual orientation Socrates Recurring South Park characters Hey Jude The Catcher in the Rye Prostate cancer Daredevil Oasis (band) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Borderline personality disorder Knots Landing Undergrads The Amber Spyglass Polyamory Shaggy dog story Free will Hollyoaks Goodness and value theory Traumatic incident reduction Anal sex Law of value The O.C.

why do some gay people have to lie to have a relationship with who they want to isn't that sad i think they should feel free to be themselves of course people should be able to be themselves and not have to lie to be happy yet at the same time it's also a fact that to be entirely honest means you could loose family friends your job house kids and even pets let's say you're living at home with your parents you meet someone wonderful but you're not out to your family you're not out because you know or feel they'll reject you are you going to come out to them and hope that if they reject you this person you've just met is going to stick around or do you simply remain silent and hope that your partner will understand it's a tricky question one that presents many different possibilities and all i can say is that nothing is black and white there are many shades of grey in between  Polyamory Theory of conduct Religious Society of Friends Human sexual behavior Friends Sexual orientation Gay The Catcher in the Rye Lie Social rule Nation of Islam Homosexuality and Christianity The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Kodocha Current teachings of Prem Rawat Supernatural Saudade Aesthetic Realism Goodness and value theory Pitaten The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Infantilism Homosexuality and Judaism Plame affair Another Side of Bob Dylan Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity One Tree Hill (TV series) Past teachings of Prem Rawat A Course In Miracles John Howard Yoder Transactional analysis Theodicy Generation X Avenue Q About Schmidt About a Boy Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Internet troll Homophobia Homosexuality and transgender EastEnders Yami no Matsuei Ludwig Wittgenstein Care Bears The Smoking Room Negima Poker jargon Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Pok__mon Live!

fragile inside a partner asks you to becareful with their fragile heart they don't know if they can survive the pain again is that being too dramatic lol she does tend to be a little over dramatic at times but i like how the other chicka put it could be i am being manipulated omg those words run chills up my spine my last partner told me that and also how horrible her last partner was to her she would repeatedly tell me how she's scared of falling for someone because she didn't want to get hurt after being with her for a while i saw the things about her that pushed her former partner to the things that she did if someone were to come at me with that line again i'd run kicking and screaming in the other direction just ask her what part she played in the last relationship if she accepts no responsibility for her part in things run for the hills good luck to you  Nine Inch Nails Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.

is is ever going to be normal to be gay because there are a lot more people coming out know and it is an issue that is coming more out into the open i was looking at some polls and it was showing that people in the weren't very accepting at all of homosexuality but a the age decreased the more accepting people were of it i think in the age group it was something like were accepting of it is it just going to become more and more acceptable until it is completely normal in our society i understand that not everyone would be because there are still people who are against rights for african americans and women i think it will eventually become accepted by the majority we're still a few decades from that happening but people are being exposed to homosexuality more and more and as a result are becoming educated about it and they're realizing that the only difference between gays and straights is the gender in which they fall in love with prior to ellen coming out in what was it ' discussing homosexuality on tv wasn't done all that much and for a well known person to come out was a huge risk to their career as ellen learned for herself when her show was shortly after canceled in just short years look how far we've come not only is homosexuality less of a taboo subject so that people are no longer afraid to talk about it but states and major businesses are recognizing the need for same sex couples to have the same security and benefits as heterosexual couples enjoy one state has even legalized marriage years ago that probably would've been way beyond what anyone would expect to happen so soon despite the right wing and neo christian groups trying to hold us back and keep us second class citizens they seem to be on the losing side and i think that basic human rights will win out eventually but it's going to take time  Same-sex marriage Human sexual behavior Marriage Sexual orientation Gay rights Homosexuality Same-sex marriage in Canada Homophobia Religion and sexuality Homosexuality and Christianity Age of consent Bisexuality Gay Lesbian Gender role Same-sex marriage in the United States Heterosexuality Religion and sexual orientation Lawrence v.

first gay experience yesterday and im confused yesterday i had my first gay experience i enjoyed it but it didn't feel right it was different because ive been with women but it felt awkward and not right i didnt feel comfortable at all i thought that if i tried it out that it would answer my question that if me having feelings towards guys were just hormones or more im not quite sure what to do now i mean i enjoyed it but like i said it didnt feel right what does this mean any thoughts or suggestions thanks if you felt like you were doing something morally wrong for you then i'd take that as my sign that this wasn't a lifestyle that i was comfortable leading but if you just thought that it was awkward i think most people gay straight lesbian bi etc feel that way during their first time maybe taking the time to become more comfortable with your partner so you can better communicate what you want and the pace you're comfortable going at would help you enjoy it more don't let all the bashers in here bother you i've always found it so amusing that people who claim to hate gays so much and be so repulsed by their behaviors are the ones that you can't beat out of the gay and lesbian section with a stick i hope you find what you're looking for i wish you luck  Homophobia Sexual orientation Transsexuality Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Human sexual behavior Anal sex Homosexuality Biology and sexual orientation Ex-gay Friends Bisexuality Strap-on dildo Homosexuality and transgender Avenue Q Milton H.

is this a good idea is writing someone a letter to tell them how you feel a good idea when you are too scared to say the words to her face after a few days i'm never going to see this woman again i think it means more when you say it if someone has the chance to over analyze something they can end up in their mind adding way more than there was meant to be or take away from it  Goodness and value theory Aristotle Carl Jung Full Metal Panic?

the worst possible thing the one thing i thought would never happen to me has happened my boyfriend cheated on me he slept with someone else when i was at work he said he was totally wasted when it happened he told me days after it happened and i totally freaked he's really sorry and i belive him when he says he still loves me and i forgive him and everything but i feel like i never want him to touch me again things were going so great with us and he totally f cked it up i really want us to be okay but i can't totally shake off what he's done does anyone have suggestions on how i can just move on and not think about whats happened because i just want to forget about it i can't even sleep in the same bed with him i keep picturing him with someone else i can't just dump him its like we've overcome so much we came out together and confronted out parents together and i love him and i can't see my myself with anyone one else i just want to forget first realize that it will be ok the most important thing right now is to communicate and talk about what happened and why no matter how difficult it is him being wasted is no excuse i believe there has to be another reason examine what happened and then determine if you both still love each other and want to work it out if you do then you both have to make it happen he has to earn your trust again and you have to let him earn it good luck  EastEnders Shaggy dog story About a Boy Friends Social rule Avenue Q Milton H.

why do ppl feel ashamed embarassed when someone witnesses them having sex or going to the bathroom these two acts are completely natural history reveals that this puritanical approch has not always been embraced by many cultures and i'm sure there are societies today that feel the same way it seems to me this kind of ethos facillitates governments that are quick to enact regulations that inhibit limit citizen's rights approach the reason these are private issues is because this is the way we are raised some societies recognize these acts as natural and don't view them as something that has to be done in private although they may have a choice let alone passing laws against them in public our society might see sex in public as exhibitionism whereas other cultures don't even know what that is they would say what's wrong w that i'm not suggesting anything that would pose a health hazzard these acts are natural as in nature what other ways of nature involve embarassment or shame when witnessed if an et were to land on earth and was being educated about the ways of mankind he would not understand this chichi maybe you're ashamed of your genitals i am certainly not ashamed of mine i may be slightly disappointed in dimension because i know what potential the jumbo size has to offer but i was never taught to be ashamed of them jen i don't see how i answered my ques my ques deals w the unnatural stigma attached to bodily functions i have alluded to the puritans as the source and quite frankly disagree w this mindset that they have so successfully managed to brainwash into their generation and have it proliferate as it permeated ea subsequent generation i also feel despite many good qualities that this religion stood stands for they are extremist and have helped facillitate a government that is fast to initiate more legislature which in turn makes that government unnecessarily larger and more powerful over the citizens the republican debacle that so thoroughly embarassed our country in the eyes of most of the world by putting our president clinton on the stand was a direct result of puritanical influence why do you think the puritans were so badly persecuted in europe that they felt forced to immigrate to the new world no where have i stated that i want to view these acts i don't have to look in fact the only reason ppl feel compelled to look is the infrequency to which this possibility occurs hopey how often does vulnerability compel any creature to seek a more private location to do their business you are right i remember being in mixed washrooms in europe and nobody thought anything of it and in china your bathroom activities are quite public it is about the way we are raised but these are deeply ingrained ways and very difficult for most people to overcome i've never really had a problem if someone caught me in the middle of a sex act i'm not an exhibitionist but hey it's natural  Separation of church and state Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Abortion debate Same-sex marriage Human sexual behavior Marriage Plame affair Infantilism Ethics Democracy Property (ownership right) Liberalism Coercion Simone Weil Theory of conduct Same-sex marriage in Canada Freedom of speech Status of religious freedom in France Homophobia Republic Alexander Technique Politics of the United States Objectivist philosophy A Course In Miracles Transsexuality Economy of the United States Theodicy Moral Politics Appeal Subud John Howard Yoder Constitution of Ireland United States Constitution Determinism Fundamentalism Homosexuality and Christianity Franz Boas Corporation Anarcho-capitalism Religious conversion American exceptionalism Civil rights Privacy Capital punishment Falun Gong Confucianism Criticism of libertarianism Sexual abstinence Capitalism Hikikomori Non-aggression principle Puritan Intelligent design Gay rights Christianity Child pornography Originalism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Baptist Abington School District v.

this is random but do homosexuals feel as though bisexuals are just looking for attention i have a few lesbian friends and this came up in conversation the other day i was just wondering because i've heard from a lot of both straight and gay people that bisexuality is not a real orientation i personally think that bisexuality is just another way of expressing one's self but i was just curious about what other people think i personally am homosexual but i don't believe that people can be straight or gay it is human nature to be attracted to the opposite sex you may not want to be sexually active with the opposite sex but you will still think dang she looks hot i think that each group thinks about identifing theirselves too much what does it matter if bisexuals are showing off or if gays are showing off all that should matter is whether or not they are happy with who they are  Sexual orientation Gay Human sexual behavior Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Reparative therapy Gender role Homophobia Homosexuality and Christianity Lesbian Transgender Gay rights Homosexuality Religion and sexual orientation Ex-gay Biology and sexual orientation Group sex Transvestism Transsexuality Gay slang Anal sex Queer Outing Don't ask, don't tell Demographics of sexual orientation Asexuality Homosexuality and Neopaganism Sex education Homosexuality and transgender Transwoman Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Homosexuality in Singapore Same-sex marriage Heteronormativity The closet Yuri (animation) Swinging Singapore gay equality movement Homosexuality and Judaism Effeminacy Orgy Laura Schlessinger Queer as Folk (U.S.) Gay pride Autogynephilia Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith Sex-positive feminism Gay rights timeline Anderson Cooper Gay bathhouse North American Man/Boy Love Association Homosexuality and Scientology Gender and sexuality studies Violence against gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and the transgendered Zoophilia Homosexuality in Japan Anti-gay slogan Liz Phair Will & Grace Homosexuality and Islam Slash fiction BDSM Homosexuality in China Child sexuality Uniting Church in Australia Kinsey Reports Religion and sexuality Anglican views of homosexuality Terminology of homosexuality Homoeroticism Section 28 Gaydar Homosexuality and Voodoo Infantilism Marriage Human sexuality Polyamory Gay village Gay community Christian right Clerical celibacy Log Cabin Republicans History of gays in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust Social rule Homosexuality and medical science Same-sex marriage in Canada OutRage!

would a drawn picture of two clothed lesbians kissing be considered pornography if it was just a cute romantic type of picture would two girls kissing passionately be considered pornography my ex girlfriend broke up with me because i requested from her best friend a drawn picture of two girls kissing passionately don't get me wrong i'm totally over her because of how lame she acted but i'm just curious as to if it would actually be considered porn or not i've talked about it with my friends and family each person i've talked with it about says that it isn't porn but i would like to hear your personal thoughts thanks i guess it comes down to what is pornography i would say a book could be pornographic even if it is written words without pictures if the picture is arousing then it could be construed as pornography personally i wouldn't see it as pornography but other people especially people who grew up in a conservative culture might consider any kind of arousing depiction even if it is just two people passionately kissing as pornography i don't think you can really criticize somebody for where they draw the line however i would hope that once somebody has drawn a line that they would be consistent about it you can't decide that a drawing of people kissing is pornography but then that sexually charged tv advertising or passionate art works in a gallery isn't pornography if you want to be consistent  Hentai Child pornography Friends Pornography in Japan Pornography Zoophilia Lesbian Pornographic movie Transsexuality Human sexual behavior Motion picture rating system Pornographic actor Internet pornography Child sexuality Bish__jo game Pedophilia Nudity Sexual revolution Love Traci Lords Sex-positive feminism Otaku Oral sex Little Britain Erotica Group sex Andrea Dworkin 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Milton H.

what is the origin of homosexuality who are the first gays how did they propagate almost all mammals across the earth and other species as well have gay members among them so the origin of homosexuality extends beyond the origin of the human species as for how we propogate that's not an easy answer however a lot of genetic traits aren't determined by any set genes often times a whole lot of genes goes into determining how bright you are how tall you are what color hair you have etc so it may be that most people have some of 'gay genes ' but not all of them it may be that when two parents together have enough of those genes and pass them to their kids they become gay another fairly widely accepted theory is that at least for boys becoming gay has a lot to do with hormones when you're in your mother's womb that would be another case where the 'gay genes' aren't passed down by people who are actually gay think of it this way a lot of short parents have tall kids often times those tall kids got their genes from their grandparents it may be that when those kids finally have kids they're even more likely to pass on their parents genes for shortness than their own genes for being tall there are a lot of cases where genetics is passed down tangently and not directly so you don't have to be gay to have gay kids in fact the vast majority of kids from gay parents are straight  Biology and sexual orientation Gene Gender role Species Sexual differentiation Sexual orientation Gay Heterosexuality Transsexuality Human Mendelian inheritance Natural selection Eye color Baldness Homosexuality and transgender Religion and sexual orientation Genetically modified organism Evolution Homosexuality Gay rights Genetics Sexual identity Human skin color Nature versus nurture Extinction Sociobiology Theory of conduct Sex Evolutionism Recessive gene Androgen insensitivity syndrome DNA Red hair Same-sex marriage Gay slang Y chromosome Dominance relationship Molecular evolution Franz Boas Biology Human height Breastfeeding Eugenics House Mouse Marriage Sexual selection Race Barbara McClintock Controversies in autism Liger Recurring South Park characters Dog Generation Y Human variability Hair Homosexuality and Christianity Kyle Broflovski Genetic engineering Ex-gay Twin Genome Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Anglican views of homosexuality Duesberg hypothesis Chromosome Mnemonic Bisexuality Horse Dinosaur Color Cosmic Era human enhancements Elephant Meme The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Sexual dimorphism Bioinformatics Digit ratio LGBT Autism Genetic algorithm Reproduction Speed of light Mitochondrial genetics History of sex Homophobia Gay rights timeline Macroevolution Reparative therapy Ork (Warhammer 40,000) Cancer Homosexuality and medical science Hair color Orders of magnitude (numbers) Creationism Cell growth Price equation Validity of human races Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Genomics

hey atheists i started asking you questions because i want to know why you don't believe in god and excuse me i am not a christian i don't have to be in a specific religious group to believe in god it's not what you say that gets you into heaven it's the things you do and the loyalty you have to the lord the only reason you don't believe in god is because you all expect him to be there every time you want something i think you let him down more than he lets you down you just don't see it so what do you have to say now either you posted here by mistake or you are assuming that all lgbtq persons are atheists could you clarify  Religion Atheism Apostasy Existence of God God Pascal's Wager Strong atheism Fundamentalism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Theodicy Pledge of Allegiance Creationism Soul A Course In Miracles Afterlife Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Agnosticism Mary, the mother of Jesus Sin LGBT Saint Catechism Supernatural Ten Commandments Evolutionary creationism Trinity Intelligent design movement John Howard Yoder Freethought Intelligent design Argument from morality Problem of Hell C.

sexuality question alright so here is my question i am a straight guy and married alot of my friends tease me because they say i act gay or give off that what they call gaydar i don't know i like to dress nice and style my hair i like video games but i also am the kinda guy that loves musicals especially phantom of the opera so i have always kinda thought of myself as either bisexual or bi curious keep in mind i have never actually done anything with another guy but i have been thinking about letting my wife peg me so does this mean i am gay bi what i don't know anymore i love my wife and love being with her but there is this other side i want to explore any suggestions ideas i think it is hard to label yourself as a bisexual i think the fact you want to dress nice and style your hair is just a question of vanity some men even get their nails done and like to wax some parts of their body but it doesn't mean they are necesserely gay they can be called metrosexual who are guys who have a strong concern on their appearance i think maybe you should analyse a few things i for example came to realize i was a lesbian because i felt attracted to girls in a physical and emotional way i've never had this connection with men so maybe you could see if you feel attracted physically to men for example maybe you have this curiosity to be with a men but you've never felt anything when you are around them i believe is from human nature this necessity to explore things and to be curious to taste and have new experiences in your case i think you should really see how bad you want to go through this experience and if it really is what you are seeking because you might risk your marriage as you said you love your wife if you leave her for example to explore this other side and this wound up not being fulfilling you might lose her on the other hand it might be the experience you were expecting and wanting to have that is why i think you should see if you can really connect with a guy in a physicall and emotional way i say emotional if you are seeking for something solid that is more than sex good luck i hope you come up with the best decision for you and be happy with it  Sexual orientation Human sexual behavior Gender role Human Transsexuality Gay slang Reparative therapy Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Friends Infantilism Homosexuality and Christianity Lesbian Gay Homosexuality Marriage Theory of conduct Cliff Richard Social rule Humphrey Bogart Characters in the Smurfs Homophobia Meaning of life Anal sex Friedrich Schleiermacher Transactional analysis Little Britain One Tree Hill (TV series) T'Pol Yuri (animation) Motivation Sharon Tate American Psycho Kyle Broflovski The Marriage of Figaro Domestic violence Same-sex marriage Dualism (philosophy of mind) Eric Cartman Something Positive Kylie Minogue Past teachings of Prem Rawat God Emperor of Dune Homosexuality and transgender Blood on the Tracks Gaydar Zoophilia The Emancipation of Mimi Kender Religion and sexual orientation Soul EastEnders The Inside Ranma __ characters Homosexuality and Judaism The Fairly OddParents BDSM Abortion debate Happiness Cole Porter The nature of God in Western theology Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Iago Yoko Ono Asexuality Jennifer Lopez Shaggy dog story Ethics David Hume Biology and sexual orientation Jon Secada Religion and sexuality Domination & submission (BDSM) Nicomachean Ethics The Invisibles History of sex Kim Possible Singapore gay equality movement Taxi Driver Kurt Cobain Swinging Dead Like Me Polyamory Simone Weil Sex and the City Anderson Cooper Queer Sex education Force (Star Wars)

are you ever propositioned by straight married guys probably a dozen times in my life i have been propositioned by straight married guys after they find out i am gay it is usually under the guise that they are curious never tried it with a man wonder what it would feel like they are horny and not getting any at home or they have had too much to drink have you had similar experiences do you believe this is the reason there is so much homophobia today these guys are afraid we are going to share their dirty little secrets we know the statistics that the majority of people arrested for lewd behavior are married guys those in parks public bathrooms etc your thoughts i've been hit on a number of times at the gym usually in the locker or shower rooms overt looks and a smile or the sauna everything from looks to touching themself and gesturing me to come closer when i don't look away in disgust at least half the time the guy is wearing a wedding ring though it's not something i'm into i generally take it as a compliment and just smile back i feel badly for obviously not entirely straight guys that get pressured into marriage as long as it doesn't translate into homophobic speech and actions even as i recognize that this type of cruising is part of what gives the gay community a bad name it's certainly ironic that gay guys that do as the religious right would have them do try to be something they're not at the expense of their loved ones are used as tools by the same folks to condemn us all  Homophobia Human sexual behavior Gay bathhouse Friends Sexual orientation Ex-gay Social rule Sauna Avenue Q Gay Gay rights Marriage Homosexuality Sento One Tree Hill (TV series) Bisexuality Religion and sexual orientation Humphrey Bogart Futurama (TV series - season 2) Ten Commandments Outing Poker jargon Toilet Eric Cartman Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Shaggy dog story Homosexuality in China Ron Weasley Gay slang Yoko Ono Homosexuality and Islam Swimming pool Customs and etiquette of Japan Homosexuality and Judaism Marilyn Monroe Trailer Park Boys Homosexuality and Scientology Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Little Britain Recurring South Park characters Queer Eye for the Straight Guy Same-sex marriage Divorce Queer About Schmidt Changeroom Nicomachean Ethics Domestic violence Gay rights timeline Infantilism Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!

has anyone else i just went through my second divorce and i am only years old on my th birthday i fullfilled a long time dream of going to bed with another man i really enjoyed it but as soon as he was done he got dressed and left i always thought that if i fulfilled my gay fantasies that i would have a better idea of whether i am gay or bi but i do not i love men for sex and women for a relationship anyway my question is is there anyway to bring these two together so that i love either one or the other for both activities i don't want to be one of those guys with a wife and a boyfriend if you know what i mean mostly you'll have to reconcile a lifetime of thinking that relationships are just between a man and a woman it'll probably be uncomfortable at first but it'll happen it's difficult when you first come out to figure out which men just want sex and which want more i think everyone at one time or another just wants a quick lay so i'm not going to be a prude about it but if you want a stronger personal connection to another man don't hop into the sack the first time you talk to each other acknowledge the interest but get to know him first that way the connection isn't completely based upon lust but there really aren't any thumbnail answers to this i recommend you go to your local lgbt center if one is available get to know other gay bi men in a different context than just a bar you'll meet real dimensional people there and network out good luck  Sexual orientation Marriage Social rule Avenue Q Anal sex Friends Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Ex-gay Homosexuality Homophobia Bisexuality The Smoking Room Humphrey Bogart LGBT Gay slang Little Britain Same-sex marriage Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Sex and the City Theory of conduct Interpersonal relationship Transsexuality Anglican views of homosexuality Gay rights Fathers' rights Meaning of life Gender role One Tree Hill (TV series) E.

why should people of good conscience celebrate perversity http www worldnetdaily com news article asp article id there's nothing inherently wrong with being gay or bisexual but some of the lewdness that goes on at gay pride parades is absolutely shameful most gay people have the good sense to act like mature adults but of course at these shameful parades there is nothing but lewdness intended to offend people nothing is more detrimental to the gay rights movement than these sick parades it is nothing but bad publicity futher reinforcing the general public's distaste for openly gay behavior right or wrong why can't they express themselves in public in a manner suitable for the general public or in a manner suitable for children i am absolutely certian that if i held a straight pride parade comprised of pimps crack whores flashers and obscene behavior in public it would be rightly called shameful too scared to offend the gay community the mainstream press ignored this event this is what people are referring to when they say that perversion is being forced down their throats you can call be a gay basher and hide behind such empty slander all you want but i have never had a problem with normal gay behavior this nonsense at the parades is what i am referring to i would not be surprised if i recieved several comments from gays and lesbians themselves disowning such behavior and rightly so obscenity and lewdness is wrong no matter what the sexual orientation directed at those of you who claim thoughtlessly well just don't go then if you don't like it did you bother to read the article some of your gay activist friends forced respectable members of the community to attend this shameful event under threat they had no choice in the matter not only did they have to go they had to participate will you read the freakin details next time knee jerk defenders of perversion as for mardi gras the same thing goes nothing but disgusting debauchery never said i supported it but at least no one is forced to go to mardi gras against their will by lewd fascists klyth thank you for your courage and integrity now watch as people accuse you of being a traitor to your cause simply because you won't behave as an extremist i get the same nonsense from so called conservatives who label me a traitor for not being extremely anti gay as stated before it's not gay that is the problem it's lewd and obscene behavior in public and otherwise decent people being forced to participate but watch as they turn my reasonable protest into homophobism when it is nothing of the sort sweetpea your answer is so beyond ignorant that it pains me to imagine what your world view is like your defense that straight people are disgusting freaks too is unmistakably weak i suppose that makes it all ok did you even bother reading the article any person of good conscience cannot condone this sort of perversion i'm not even sorry it ruffles your pink feathers that i speak out against it welcome to the world people don't like sick freaks like your obscene friends in the leather club half of the gay responders in here don't support this nonsense keep parading around and wiping filth in the faces of decent people and see how far that gets you in the hearts and minds of the general public this is what people hate not the choice not the lifestyle not the average gay person but the obscene immature freak ruining things for the rest of you i will not be bullied into tolerance by fascist amoral pigs who cram lewdness down my throat i am completely supportive of the gay community but i do not agree with some of the things you see at some of these events i have also been witness some lewd gestures and acts of a sexual nature which i don't think is appropriate in a public place especially where there may be children present but i feel the same way about some of the things you see at events that are not gay related take mardi gras for example i saw the breasts of the women next to me more often than i see my own however most of the gay pride related events i have been to have been perfectly suitable for the public i think in any gathering like this gay or straight there will be people who take celebrating too far  Homosexuality and Christianity Bisexuality Theory of conduct Human sexual behavior Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Gay slang Lesbian Gay

is it possible to have gay relationship that isn't centered around sex it seems to me that gay men are only interested in sex don't get me wrong sex is an important part of a relationship but it is only a small part as an older gay man ancient in the gay community i would love to find a solid well rounded relationship with a smart attractive gay man that isn't centered around only sex is that even possible possible yes but hard to find i am also and looking for something more it's unfortunate that the gay life seems to be how many partners you have sex with and not how to maintain a life with one man  Human sexual behavior Sexual orientation Pedophilia Homosexuality Ex-gay Anal sex Gay slang Same-sex marriage Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Friends Homosexuality and transgender Marriage Sex and the City Homosexuality in Japan The Smoking Room Gay bathhouse Age disparity in sexual relationships Religion and sexual orientation Homosexuality and Judaism Transgender Queer as Folk (U.S.) North American Man/Boy Love Association Polyamory BDSM Zoophilia Laura Schlessinger Age of consent Homosexuality and Hinduism Heterosexuality History of the Gay Community Sex Same-sex marriage in the United States History of sex Gender role Lesbian Gay rights Religion and sexuality Incest Social rule Orgy Gay rights timeline Homosexuality in China Condom Cybersex Heteronormativity Childlove movement Effeminacy Don't ask, don't tell Homophobia Slash fiction Asexuality Terminology of homosexuality Outing Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith Homosexuality and Christianity Kylie Minogue Sexual attraction AIDS Civil unions in the United Kingdom Sexual intercourse Interpersonal relationship Swinging Child sexual abuse Cruising (film) Paragraph 175 Something Positive Biology and sexual orientation Pederasty Lawrence v.

am i right or over reacting so there is this guy at this gym i go to who always talks to me he's nice but talks a lot way to much i am nice to him and let him talk and talk even though i am there to work out and that's it but one thing i notice about him is that he always watches me always it slightly makes me uncomfortable he goes to machines that i am on from behind and watches me too he stares at my body he also watches me from the mirror from distances this is constant i feel bad because i am not to comfortable with this guy but i am afraid to say anything to him because ne never talks about me being gay or him being gay he is not american and am afraid that he knows he's gay but does not talk about it at all if i say something he might get defensive and potentially violent as this is always the case with guys who are like that is he kind of stalking me with the staring and watching i also feel bad because when i keep conversations short and quick because i am there to work out not socialize a lot he feels as if i am supposed to talk to him just as much and if i don't i'm a jerk i don't mean to be i am just there to work out ya know but he watches me a lot what does this mean is he being aggressive and stalking me or no i am thinking that too but oh how inconviencancing spelling i think he's crushing on you and admiring your body if you don't like it and don't want to hurt his feelings you could try to switch your gym time or you could politely say to him yeah i'm really trying to focus i've been slacking lately with my workout and put headphones on then just try to ignore him i know what you mean about being there to work out and being uncomfortable the same thing happened to me with some guy in a yellow spandex outfit and after i had old creepy fat men staring at me in the locker room i never went back so try to be polite to him and just basically let him know that you are there to work out and that's it or you could always start talking about your boyfriend to him that might also help or get someone you know to go with you to the gym as he might back down from you then  Social rule Little Britain Theory of conduct Friends Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Shining (film) Shaggy dog story Andrew Dice Clay Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Weight training The Ashlee Simpson Show Megan Griffin Gay slang Totally Spies!

what do guys think about women i always wondered what did the majority of guys think about women are we just objects of pleasure to you as most of the media and advertisements constantly try to portray or do you actually believe we are living breathing things that you can communicate with on a level of equality along with this do you think it's possible for you to have such a perfect person as beyonce in your life or do yu realize that not every woman wants to fit the doll like models of a celebrity please reply i think a lot has to deal with how men are brought up men are visual so they are going to place a certain level of value on looks that being said there is a man for every woman i think women are definitely more selective than men ever will be and like it was said before what constitutes beauty is different for everybody i certainly don't want a beyonce or wafer thin model for a girlfriend the men in my family have tended to like strong willed women and my direct lineage on both sides have not divorced as far as i can research i think we need to start acting like a couple should compliment the other instead of acting like the bickersons all the time like grandma said what you're with is what you're worth  Destiny's Child Physical attractiveness Solar cell Cliff Richard Domestic violence Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Eastern Orthodox Church Art Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sexual orientation Beyonc__ Knowles Same-sex marriage Friends Strap-on dildo Human sexual behavior Divorce Genealogy Love Parliament of Canada Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Theory of conduct Gaze Homestar Runner Bondage (BDSM) Social psychology Ranma __ characters Badminton The Fountainhead Oral sex Daredevil The Sims 2 Grimke Sisters Fiddler on the Roof Anorexia nervosa Carmen Phoebe Buffay's songs Social rule Conscription Paradise Lost Infantilism Obsessive-compulsive disorder Fahrenheit 451 2channel Summa Theologiae Economic inequality Fathers' rights Canadian Senate Same-sex marriage in Canada Kelly Rowland Religion Kosas Intelligent design movement Nudity Simone Weil The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Hiberno-English Dead Like Me Management Asian fetish Paragliding Married... with Children Equine conformation Numerology Japanese tea ceremony Gender role Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Women in Islam Left-handed U.S. Electoral College Goodness and value theory Sharon Tate Milton H.

is it possible that a man is hetrosexual till the age of and thereafter become a homosexual i don't think so i can't say for sure because everyone is different but i believe that if you are homosexual you are most likely going to be one from birth however you might be bisexual that is a possibility and maybe since you're you've reached the point where you are comfortable enough to consider that other side of your nature or it could also be that you've dated or been married for a while to women and decided that those weren't working for you to the point that you want to fully embrace the other part of you and see where it leads you it could be many things but i think most people are who they are period some just don't realize that there are other sides to themselves until later in life hope this helps you good luck  Bisexuality Sexual orientation Gay Ex-gay Human sexual behavior Infantilism Vernon Schillinger Friends Heteronormativity Homophobia Marriage Transsexuality Transgender William Shakespeare Summa Theologiae Clerical celibacy Don't ask, don't tell Age of consent Homosexuality and Judaism Homosexuality and transgender Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith Generation X LGBT Theory of conduct Gay rights Coming out Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Homosexuality Heterosexuality History of sex Aesthetic Realism Biology and sexual orientation Mystique (comics) Transvestism Gay slang Religion and sexuality Humphrey Bogart Homosexuality and Islam Reparative therapy Metropolitan Community Church Homosexuality and Neopaganism Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Incarnations of Immortality Homosexuality and Christianity Scenes from a Memory Religion and sexual orientation Blonde on Blonde Phoebe Buffay's songs Laura Schlessinger Homosexuality and Scientology Alfred Kinsey Stewie Griffin Autogynephilia Singapore gay equality movement Cole Porter Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Religious Society of Friends Homosexuality in China Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Queer Anal sex John Holmes (actor) Barbra Streisand Nicomachean Ethics Holy Orders Fable (video game) Social rule Sex-positive feminism Kate Vaiden Boston Public Bill Maher Group sex Homosexuality and medical science 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sharon Tate Escape from New York Charly Garc__a Aphrodite Fecal incontinence Bi-curious The Critic Culture of Lithuania Arthur Schopenhauer Lawrence v.

am i wrong or is he right im bi and my bf and i have been together for yrs i was hanging out with my friend today since we both had off work she is lez by the way so i told my bf my plans since he had to work and couldnt join us after we hung out and he was out of work he called me really mad because we hung out in his mind its not right for me to hang out with a lez unless were in a group bc i'm bi we are just friends and nothing more nothing happened or will ever happen between us i have never cheated on my bf and always tell him who i am hanging out with before hand am i wrong to hang out with a lez bc i am bi he sees it the same way as him hanging out with a girl hes straight i just dont see it the same way actually you are both right and both wrong here's why first if its ok for you to be friends and hang out with another girl then it should be ok for him to hang out with another girl as long as they are just friends no way if either one is interested in each other but just friends is ok question is how would you feel if he hung out with a girl who was a friend would it bother you or would you be ok with it does he have all of your trust in that situation or would you be suspicious if you put yourself in his place and ask yourself how you would feel if the situation were reversed somewhat then you can maybe understand how he feels if you are ok with him hanging out with a female friend who is a friend only then you'll need to tell him this before he can understand that you give him the same freedom you take for yourself i can understand how you feel you have your friend and you know you're innocent but your boyfriend is treating you like you're guilty or that you might be guilty someday i hate to take his side in this kind of thing but it really is only fair if he can do the same things as you do he might be straight but you're not and that means that your lesbian friend could be a rival at least in his eyes the question is are you willing to give him the same rights as you have or can you resist hanging out with your friend unless in a group i know these choices suck don't they still i think it has to be fair both ways or it can't exist at all besides that you've probably heard many rumors already where the ignorant claim that all bisexual people cheat that they think they deserve one person from each gender i know they're not true but your boyfriend probably has and probably doesn't like the idea of having to share your affections for whatever reason he has he's worried about losing you that part is good because it shows you have value to him but it will make things rough as you two come to an agreement i know the female friend idea isn't great but somehow you both have to come to a compromise and figure out if you each trust each other or not if the trust or lack thereof is the problem then work on that first before you move on to this question good luck  Theory of conduct Goodness and value theory Sexual orientation Theodicy God Emperor of Dune Little Britain Avenue Q EastEnders Ex-gay Philosophical skepticism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Capital punishment Polyamory Jon Secada Gender role Something Positive Plame affair Milton H.

how prevalent do you think that ageism is in the glbt world most of us are the boomer generation and we outnumber the new generation i was just reading a book about this the boomer century and it suggested that boomers accomplished so much just because there were so many of us and furthermore that we will change the future of aging because of this we already have in many ways todays is not what my parents were at but do you see ageism as a problem in today's glbt society i tend to see us as demanding elder care facilities and such eventually but do you have any ideas i mean we are no longer part of the bar scene nor do we wish to be am i the person your mother warned you about i hope you are that person ben now in all seriousness i would like to take this opportunity to thank you and all the generations of lgbt individuals before me you are the ones who made the sacrifices and many today take it for granted i feel honored to be thought highly of by a few of the boomer generation lgbt individuals and think a lot of the younger generation should listen up to what they have to say  LGBT Homophobia Generation Y Demographics Generation X Transsexuality Ageism Gay community Education Strauss and Howe Chinese character Abortion debate Homosexuality The Giver Theory of conduct Ageing Religious Society of Friends Jewish principles of faith Bubblegum Crisis Social Security (United States) Anorexia nervosa Roman mythology Adolescence Domestic violence Generation gap Taoism Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Mother Teresa Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Sexual orientation Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Advertising Generation Medal of Honor Infantilism David Hume Autism rights movement Gay slang Gay Autism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Gender role John Howard Yoder Sacrifice EastEnders Marshall McLuhan Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief About a Boy Economic inequality Prayer Ephebophilia Ephebiphobia Asperger syndrome Amway Microeconomics Homeschooling Psychoanalysis Charmed Academia Hikikomori Goodness and value theory Franz Boas Baby boomer Cincinnati Bengals Homosexuality in Singapore Galactica 1980 Biology and sexual orientation Deconstruction Confucianism Capital punishment Inflation Social rule Tai Chi Chuan Extreme Programming Order of the Garter Sociology Stuttering Theodore Kaczynski Breastfeeding Discrimination Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040 Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Fathers' rights Bisexuality Homosexuality and Christianity Human height Schizophrenia Roman Catholic Church Christian eschatology Altruism Heterosexuality Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Noahide Laws Rudolf Hermann Lotze Post-World War II baby boom Sigmund Freud Computer 2004 Republican National Convention Economics James Dobson

should i be mad at my boyfriend for telling me that he is gay after yrs of dating we broke up a while ago but i am still not over it we broke up a while ago but im still not over it personally i think i should be mad because we grew up together he had so many times to tell me i just feel like i wasted freakin yrs you have every right to be angry i can't think of a single straight woman who wouldn't be enraged at that i've been dating my boyfriend for years now and if he told me he was gay i can't even imagine how devastated and betrayed i would feel it would be really hard to trust another guy after that however staying angry at him doesn't really help you it's not going to change the fact that he's gay and it's not going to help you get over it any faster i think you have to try to forgive him and move on i've found that really making an effort to forgive someone even when it's hard really helps me feel better in the long run if it would help maybe you should try talking to him not to tear into him but to let him know exactly what he did to you and how much you're hurting over it sometimes just getting those emotions off of your chest do wonders for you especially when you have the freedom to tell the person who hurt you what he she did to you a heartfelt apology for stringing you along could go a long way that being said one of my best friends dated two guys who turned out to be gay before she found mr right so don't worry there's hope good luck  EastEnders Friends Kodocha Tenshinhan Piccolo Junior Saga Social rule Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Eddie Guerrero Jon Secada Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ron Weasley Sin City Sex and the City One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Ranma __ characters Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an St. Elmo's Fire (film) Laura Schlessinger Boston Public Dawson's Creek Mystique (comics) Series finale God Emperor of Dune Characters of Naruto Pitaten Wallflower (comics) Jam (TV series) Rent (musical) Jean Grey Domestic violence The Ashlee Simpson Show The Amber Spyglass Everwood Darth Vader Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Pok__mon Live!

does being a gay man mean wearing womens jeans lip gloss having a lisp and acting very feminine or does being gay man mean you are attracted to other men if it's the latter why would a gay person find it to be homophobic when they are dressed in this way and someone gives them crazy looks why is homosexuality defined as being attracted to the same sex but portrayed as putting on the characteristics of the opposite sex homosexuals think the world gives them crazy looks because they are holding hands with the same sex or something but dont think about the fact that certain behavior just looks ridiculous no matter what your sexual orientation is when i think of gay people i've met and this is my oppinion i can never really remember feeling they were being real it always seems like a show to me http www aolcdn com ch bv miss jay alexander split newswire a jpg need i say more so the or men i saw at the mall only days ago were just media portrayals i don't think so i wish it weren't really because i dont think they really knew how ridiculous they looked i guess my answer to this would be does being a gay woman mean wearing men's jeans shirts boots having a deep voice and walking with a swagger to generalize someone based on looks is fairly common i'll admit and whether it's media portrayal that's left people assuming things about others or not i can't say that for sure truth is the gay men in the media are easy to spot because they are deliberatly flamboyant they are mostly celebrities take elton john for example if he didn't wear pink suits in public would you know if he was gay or not i know that some people gay or lesbian put on a show make it obvious and flaunt it to the world that's their choice i also know there are plenty of homosexuals who don't and i have to wonder sometimes is it balanced now  Sexual orientation Gay Human sexual behavior Homophobia Bisexuality Gay rights Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Ex-gay Transsexuality Gay slang Heteronormativity Homosexuality and Judaism Little Britain Pedophilia Same-sex marriage Biology and sexual orientation Homosexuality Homosexuality in China Friends Social rule Effeminacy Coming out Religion and sexual orientation Transvestism Singapore gay equality movement Slash fiction Heterosexuality Outing Reparative therapy LGBT Aesthetic Realism Societal attitudes towards homosexuality EastEnders Queer as Folk (U.S.) Bill O'Reilly (commentator) Gay bathhouse Don't ask, don't tell Herbert Garrison Anglican views of homosexuality Stonewall riots Laura Schlessinger Jon Secada North American Man/Boy Love Association Choice and sexual orientation Demographics of sexual orientation Nudity South Park Gay pride Strap-on dildo Homosexuality and Scientology Anderson Cooper Humphrey Bogart Anal sex Sex Shaggy dog story Boston Public Terminology of homosexuality Cruising (film) Drag queen Butch and femme Same-sex marriage in the United States Gay rights timeline Section 28 The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Anti-gay slogan Pornographic movie Sinfest Queer Homosexuality and Neopaganism Will & Grace Camille Paglia Marilyn Monroe Married... with Children Homosexuality in Singapore Age of consent Asexuality Sexism History of gays in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust Drawn Together Jeff Gannon Same-sex marriage in Canada Viz (comic) Pederasty Skinhead Recurring South Park characters The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Sex and the City John Holmes (actor) Cliff Richard American Psycho Zoophilia

how about a little late night association game i was struck with inspiration for a small photoshop project my question is what is the first thing that comes into your mind when you see this picture here's the link http i photobucket com albums aa geewillie domaetc jpg the most interesting and believable idea will get the best answer thanks for the artistic input so far i changed it up a little bit hopefully it will be more legible the first thing that came to my mind was the fonts are unreadable perhaps if the church in the background was a little subdued or if you could change the transparency of the background the text will be easier on the eye overall the association one derives out of this piece of work is the church's influence on politics specifically against homosexuality the background is dour and gives a rather stark and depressing vibe  Social psychology The Chemical Brothers Goatse.cx EIA-708 Fundamentalism Typeface Theory of conduct Super Nintendo Entertainment System Scientology beliefs and practices HTML element Philosophy of language Live 8 Van Morrison XML 2D computer graphics ASCII art Ludwig Wittgenstein Religion Autism John Cage PNG International Phonetic Alphabet HyperText Transfer Protocol Numerology Anglican views of homosexuality Calculus Graphic design Mouse (computing) Church of Christ Jon Secada Social rule Philosophy Separation of church and state Milton H.

why the people told me there is no woman or man in a gay relationship it's necessary to be someone who takes that because the gay who is will be the bottom will be the woman no and the top the man the bottom should have what the woman does for his man no sorry if i was rude people no roles vary each partner is usually quite versatile and many couples do not practice anal sex at all there are other ways of doing it but no nobody plays the role of woman or man your english is really good but you are using what we call run on sentences here you are not putting periods into the sentences and it makes it difficult to understand i know what speaking a foreign language is like and how difficult it can be you also are using tenses incorrectly you cannot use is and will be together 'is' is present tense 'will be' is future tense hope this helps a bit  Anal sex BDSM Strap-on dildo Gay slang Age of consent Group sex Human sexual behavior Marriage Homosexuality and transgender Gender role Homosexuality Social rule Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Same-sex marriage Religion and sexuality AIDS German language Gay rights Gender-neutral language Bondage (BDSM) Oral sex Federal Marriage Amendment Homosexuality in Japan Transgender Polyamory Bislama Non-native pronunciations of English Paragraph 175 Homosexuality and Christianity English grammar Rape Gay bathhouse Gay Infantilism Bulgarian language Avenue Q Gay rights timeline Family Bisexuality Feminist movement Lawrence v.

do you think drag queens further negative stereotypes of homosexuals they're acts are always focused on a certain amount of biatchyness and the majority of the laughs are taken from making fun of people in the audience and in the majority of bars around here a huge amount of fun is gotten by taking the mick out of heterosexuals drag queens seem to epitomise the stereotypical homosexual so y a users what do you think harmless fun in a unique brand of comedy or potentially offensive in a packaging that causes more tension between gays and straights i guess you could say i know a lot about this subject i spent years working as a drag queen i was at that time the only straight drag queen in nz i was lucky enough to be able to perform not only in new zealand but also aussie and the us like any performing art there are different types of acts that can be performed and it is up to the performer how they and what they do personally i used to use comedy as the main part of my act and it was usually very sexual but for the typw of audiences i was in front of they usually went down really well the reason i gave up performing was because of the bitchyness between the girls i was not liked by some of the girls because i was straight and used to have to put up with some nusty comments from time to time oh and the person who mentioned the problem between that tss have with drag queens well i am married to a post op ts and she didn't and still doesn't have a problem with drag queens i have even got her on stage a few times  Drag queen Gay slang Sexual orientation Homophobia Kylie Minogue Whose Line Is It Anyway?

is incest between two sisters or two brothers illegal in the uk why heterosexual incest is illegal because of the possibility of mixing too similar genes as this won't happen in a homosexual relationship there would presumably be no legal if not moral reasons for it to be illegal sorry if this question offends anyone it's not meant to i was just wondering in case anyone is wondering i'm an only child actually ashley i was not looking for anything of the sort i was just wondering if it would be legal and why you may have a point there but this is a taboo subject and i suspect people will react with disgust to this question which i think is a good question to ask does this mean that mothers can have sexual relationships with their daughters and fathers with their sons  Incest Incest taboo Pedophilia Religion and sexuality Lawrence v.

serious question what do you think is the reason that that you are homosexual don't worry i'm not some over religious troll but honestly what do you think is the reason is for you don't take the answers of everyone else i think it's a mixture of genes hormones when we are born environmental factors and mostly how much we give into homosexual or hetrosexual desires that determenes our our standard orientation good point geewillie we would be a totally different person if we changed some how i am kind of attracted to woman but i don't want to marry and put up with the crap i connect better with males years ago i read a study on the homosexual brain which suggested that certain regions are larger than in heterosexual brains also there was a reference to hormones and the effects of those hormones on a homosexual brain that is what convinced me that i was born this way furthermore i was raised the exact same way as my siblings and i wasnt abused in any way so environmental factors are unlikely like everyone else on this forum i just know  Biology and sexual orientation Heterosexuality Reparative therapy Transsexuality Homosexuality and transgender Homophobia Gender role Bisexuality Homosexuality Transgender Puberty Intelligence quotient Sexual differentiation Pedophilia Religion and sexual orientation Choice and sexual orientation Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Motivation Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Signal transduction Prostate cancer Gay slang Same-sex marriage Homosexuality and Judaism Child sexuality Infantilism Same-sex marriage in Canada Breast cancer LGBT History of intersex surgery Cancer Marriage Dragons (Pern) Human Aesthetic Realism Theory of conduct Lawrence v.

helpp how do i let this gay guy know i'm really not interested okay well i was working and this guy came in who is friends with this girl i work with he and i started having a conversation he seemed cool and i didn't really think anything of it right afterwards the girl i work with pulls me to the side and tells me to stop flirting with him hell i didn't even realize he was gay but i guess he thought i was interested because within a day he finds me on facebook and requests to be my friend i say yes just because i don't want to seem like an asshole and he comes in often and within minutes of excepting hes commented on of my photos ranging from awwww cute to saying that fag is a mean word friend who commented before him jokingly called me a fag cause i looked like quite tool in the picture i really don't want to come off homophobic or rude but i also don't want my friends thinking i'm gay or something what should i do i would recommend the direct approach people really need to learn the difference between flirtation and friendly conversation in the most gentle way that you can you just have to tell him the truth if he's mature he should be able to accept it if he's not mature then you can't be held responsible for any fit that he throws you seem like a decent person who actually cares enough to come here and find a way to let him off easy he is lucky that he wasn't interested in a guy who would have beat him up he couldn't have asked for a better way for a rejection to turn out if he gets too upset remind him of that  Social rule Humphrey Bogart Kyle Broflovski Friends Theory of conduct Milton H.

how does one come out to family friends and coworkers who are biphobic and homophobic first of all why does one need to 'come out' when one knows there is a hostile environment what it sounds like the best thing to do is to live your life the way you see fit if your 'worlds collide' e g a bf gf comes round to stay or a question is asked give an honest answer the point is 'coming out' is always problamatic as people feel the need to tell all in a potentially threatening way if you care about these people you have to be sensitive to their way of thinking but at the same time true to yourself much as you might want to there is no way to get people to come to terms with it all overnight you have to present the situation in 'bitesize chunks' giving them time to let things sink in and realise your life isn't so threatening after all  Homophobia Theory of conduct Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Amber Spyglass Ethics The nature of God in Western theology Sexual orientation Meaning of life The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe About a Boy Honey and Clover Publication of Darwin's theory Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Milton H.

what's the difference between being bisexual asexual and transsexual this might seem like a dumb question but i really do want to know the answer a bisexual person can be attracted to the same gender or the opposite gender they may be more likely to prefer or or the other it's not necessarily they are no more likely to be promiscuous than anyone else that's a myth a person can be bi without ever having had a sexual encounter with a person of the same gender asexual means someone not interested in a sexual relationship with anyone they may be romantically interested however transsexual means a person who believes they are a different gender than their biology the term is archaic because it's not a sexual orientation a better term is transgender a person can be transgender without undergoing sexual reassignment surgery mtf means male to female transgender ftm means female to male  Sexual orientation Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Bisexuality Gay slang Transvestism Sex reassignment surgery Gender role Homosexuality and transgender Gender identity Transman LGBT Asexuality Human sexual behavior Autogynephilia Coming out Lesbian Homosexuality Queer Cross-dressing Homophobia Bi-curious Legal aspects of transsexualism Sexual identity Same-sex marriage Sex Reparative therapy Pedophilia Gender reassignment therapy Demographics of sexual orientation Homosexuality and Christianity Woman John Money Gender Passing Heterosexuality Sex assignment Asian fetish Infantilism Orgasm Homosexuality and Neopaganism Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female Slash fiction History of intersex surgery Non-human animal sexuality Standards of care for gender identity disorders Transfeminism Sexual attraction Feminism The closet Genderqueer Child sexuality Man Effeminacy Castration Sex-positive feminism Queer theory Transphobia Gender and sexuality studies Intersexuality Swinging History of sex Gender-neutral language Human sexuality Paraphilia Group sex BDSM Choice and sexual orientation Religion and sexual orientation Violence against gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and the transgendered Ex-gay Gay village Gay rights Homosexuality in Japan Sex education Yuri (animation) Cisgender Name change Hijra (South Asia) David Reimer God and gender Plant sexuality Butch and femme Civil rights Alfred Kinsey Human variability Toilet Homosexuality in Singapore Physical attractiveness

gay marriage is it a contradiction how can gay's want to get married when if you look not speculate or guess you'll find that marriage is a religious thing and from what i've read pretty much all religions are against it therefore how can you want something from something that condems you secondly how can the government dictate whether gays can be married or not when there is supposed to be seperation of religion and state third how do you spell check this portion of the question p s this is a serious question i'm not really one way or the other on the issue and yes i have checked the earliest marriage found was a religious seramony hence the start of marriage i really wish i could put this in the religion catagory and this one for interjoining answers kacie and charlie those are exactly the answers i didnt ask for how can someone believe what you say when you can't even read a question o k your right same question to the athiests o k some of you misunderstood my question i'm not asking wether or not they should be alowed i am asking why would they want to i can see life union or something like that but marriage is based in religion also any church that uses king james or any other version of this bible condems it this is to include even the satanic bible i havn't been able to study wicca yet sorry and the bibles don't condem the athiests i wouldn't want a church to sanctify my relationship if that church condemned me but there are churches who will perform commitment ceremonies in lieu of marriage i would consider that option you've hit on the heart of the problem government has granted rights based upon religious ceremonies and probably shouldn't have done that there ought to be a distinct discrete separation between the religious ceremony and the civil contract i'm not sure how to spell check this l  Same-sex marriage in Canada Marriage Separation of church and state Roman Catholic Church Same-sex marriage in the United States Opus Dei Infant baptism Fundamentalism Sexual orientation Religion and sexual orientation Federal Marriage Amendment Jewish view of marriage History of the British constitution Resurrection of Jesus Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Puritan Abington School District v.

i can tell my gf is nerves about sex with me first im a girl bi and me and my gf haven't seen eachother in months so im planning to have that nite we are both virgins im mostly the guy in the reat so i guess i have to use the toys on her the most we have been together for years in sept so i know how she is she can be uncomfortable with things like that i want this to be special so can i have advice on makeing her feel good about this like are there certain tips i can have to make her ready i dont want to push her into doing it thou i'm picking her up at the airport and then we are going to dinner then to are house what do i do then should i watch a movie with her should we go st to bed and do it help me i need all the tips you have i would say watch tv or something to keep your mind somewhat distracted just start to makeout with her as you have in the past be honest with each other about what feels good and what doesn't forget the toys you don't need them when it gets to the point where you are petting down there you should be able to get naked with each other just do what feels good to each other and that you are both comfortable with you don't have to put something into your vaginas in order to give your virginity to each other in my opinion taking your clothes off and bringing each other to orgasm counts even if you end up having an orgasm playing with your own clit while she is kissing you and rubbing your breasts she is still actively and lovingly helping to bring you to orgasm in the heat of the moment it is about doing what feels good to each other it isn't about if we don't do this specific thing then we are still virgins relax and enjoy each other  Strap-on dildo Friends Masturbation Orgasm Oral sex Anal sex Milton H.

lesbians do you go after straight women even if you know they are not gay i am curious my boss is a lesbian and even though i have nothing against homosexuals i feel very uncomfortable around her i catch her looking at me and i don't like it one bit she knows i am straight so i want to know if you give up after you find out the person you are interested in is not gay i really want to know i don't mean to insult anyone the problem is that she pays special attention to me like what i like to eat my hairstyle it does bug me but she is my boss and i need the job irvos depend on the guy if i like him then i won't mind it otherwise i would see it as nuisance artsparky thanks i never go after straight women because i know they aren't interested too much drama is involved now there are lesbians that find it a challenge to try to go after a straight woman much like how guys try to pick up girls you can never say that someone is or isn't interested purely by their sexual orientation if she continues to look at you look back at her the same way you would look at a guy showing you aren't interested showing her that you realize what she is doing she might get the hint and stop looking if she continues then say something to her maybe you are reading too much into the situation the majority of lesbians though do not chase after straight women  Lesbian Gay Friends Human sexual behavior Sexual orientation Ex-gay LGBT Gender role Gay slang Kyle Broflovski Bisexuality Biology and sexual orientation Coming out Gay rights Homosexuality and transgender Anal sex Something Positive Transgender Domestic violence Anglican views of homosexuality Queer Will & Grace Kender Same-sex marriage Homosexuality Herbert Garrison Reparative therapy Aerial (dance move) Theory of conduct Strap-on dildo Yuri (animation) Choice and sexual orientation Stewie Griffin Homosexuality and Judaism Same-sex marriage in the United States The Critic Totally Spies!

why is it easier for young people to deal with the fact that a relative is gay than their older counterparts children do not see it as right or wrong they see it as people loving each other children are pure and untainted so to them love is love is love is love they don't care who you love as long as you love them too they have not been taught by society that it is wrong or shameful or sinful it is the age when we need to teach children tolerance of every one childhood it is much harder to teach a teen or an adult tolerance than it is a child children are easily moldable and teachable if you teach them tolerance than it will probably stick with them through their entire lives but if you teach them to be bigoted or intolerant then that will stick with them too  Pedophilia Theodicy Sex education Homosexuality Infantilism Lewis Carroll Transactional analysis Autism rights movement Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith Criticisms of Christianity Evil Polyamory Transsexuality Asperger syndrome Pitaten Ten Commandments The Giver Religion and sexual orientation Incest Sin Paradox Orson Scott Card Religion and sexuality Lie Same-sex marriage Religion Homosexuality and Christianity Lactose intolerance Human sexual behavior Israel ben Eliezer Nudity Narcissism Domestic violence George Fox John Howard Yoder Jon Secada Childlove movement Discordianism Aqua Teen Hunger Force Slavoj __i__ek The Adventures of Pete & Pete Adolescence Stuttering Theory of conduct Urantia Jewish views of religious pluralism Grief Opus Dei Child abuse Ex-gay John the Baptist Recurring South Park characters Hip hop collaborations Cult Moral Politics Unitarianism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Child sexuality Pederasty Justification (theology) Criticism of libertarianism Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Laura Schlessinger Hashish Rich Mullins Child pornography Abortion debate Islam and anti-Semitism Confucius Mnemonic Ephebophilia Cultural relativism Creationism Homosexuality and Islam Zoophilia James Dobson Children of God Sant Thakar Singh South Park Inherit the Wind Coercion Charles Grandison Finney Child Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Book of Isaiah Rastafari movement Section 28 Utopia (book) Soap opera International Society for Krishna Consciousness One Tree Hill (TV series) Blankets (graphic novel) Blood (computer game) Alcoholics Anonymous God History of Christianity and homosexuality Generation Y Pornography Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Girl

creepy or what i'm going to leave most of the boring details out but we had some poeple over at out house and there was this one girl who caught my attention she looked like she was in her 's and she had short hair i kind of got a gay vibe from her but i didn't really pay more attention when my mom introduced me to her she said you daughter is very pretty and there was def something about the way she said it and she kept staring at me throughout the evening but i didn't really mind she was pretty hot but here comes the creepy part at one point she asked me if she could borrow my phone because hers had died i said yeah sure she excused herself for a mintue and the next day she called me and asked me if i remembered her i said sure do we talked for a while and then it hit me how did she get my number she told me she had gotten it when she had borrowed my phone i find her very attractive but the way she got my number kind of turns me off was it creey or what wow i'm sorry that was really long andigravity i had my number saved under 'voicemail so yeah she did dig around a bit let's see borrowed your cell phone on a pretext and decided to lift your number off it well i don't know about your phone but my phone doesn't display its own phone number if you just open it up to use it you actually have to go into the phone book to find it so the question i think you should be asking now that this woman has proven she'll root around in your private information to get something she wants without so much as letting you know first is what other information did she help herself to while she was ferreting around in my phone if she's willing to invade your privacy for her own ends she's willing to invade the privacy of others for the same reason so she could very well have the personal information of your friends and family she could have checked your call logs to see if she had any competition find out who she had to suck up to in order to put herself closer to you etc at best it's a completely tasteless and tactless thing to do which proves she doesn't actually respect your need for privacy and personal boundaries any decent person borrowing another's phone would have known to keep their noses out just like any decent person knows that using someone else's bathroom doesn't entitle them to root around in the drawers and medicine cabinet what's to stop her from sneaking your diary or hacking into your email if she wants to check up on you once the two of you are in a relationship nope i'm all with you what she did was creepy creepy creepy creepy it would definitely be setting off alarm bells in the back of my head personally if i were in your shoes i would not only try to refrain from having any more to do with the woman in question i'd make sure my mother knew what her friend decided to sneak off and do not only is this a trust issue for you it's one for your mom as well after all this isn't just what she decided to do when you loaned her your phone it's what she decided to do when your mother invited her into your home edit yeah i kinda figured she had to go poking around for it so at the very least you know she decided to go checking your private messages even though she didn't know you or have permission to do so in fact she may not have even been looking for your phone number since it was listed as voicemail and not my phone number like it is on my phone it may be that while she was busy spying on you and invading your privacy she happened upon it it definitely sets off the boiling bunnies alarm bells in the back of my head i'd steer clear  Shaggy dog story The Inside Friends Plame affair Theory of conduct Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Little Britain Ocean's Twelve EastEnders Avenue Q The Catcher in the Rye The Emancipation of Mimi Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Garfield Have I Got News For You Sin City Kodocha Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Telephone numbering plan Futurama (TV series - season 2) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Surveillance Poker jargon StarCraft: Uprising Prank flash My Life as a Teenage Robot About a Boy Privacy Kyle Broflovski The Star Wars Holiday Special 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Russian joke Milton H.

what should i do how do you tell your parents your gay when there strict catholics think carefully about the timing of it first of all if you think your parents will react badly in such a way that threatens your safety or freedom if you're not an adult then waiting until you are independent might be the best thing to do get a good support network so you have people to fall back on if your family rejects you create a family of choice also be patient with your parents they might react badly at first but change with time even if they seem to write you off don't write them off you know that's all a worse case scenario they might realize that loving their child is really the only important thing you never know  Transsexuality Theodicy Pitaten Polyamory Divorce Freeters Karen Horney Ex-gay Transactional analysis Autism rights movement Domestic violence Childfree Childlove movement About a Boy Utilitarianism Coercion Hikikomori Social rule Free will Justification (theology) Sex education Allergy Hearing impairment Kelly Clarkson The Jazz Singer Narcissism One Tree Hill (TV series) Moral Politics Friends Human sexual behavior Kender Gender role Original sin Opus Dei Calvin and Hobbes Shaggy dog story Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Goodfellas The Sims 2 Spanking Abortion debate Rich Mullins Anne Rice Religious pluralism Badly Drawn Kitties Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Ethics Family First Party Paternalism Fathers' rights Euthanasia Milton H.

how do i shave my butt and butthole as well as other things i want to have a smooth and hairless ass as well as the crotch area also there is some hair on my chest i want to get rid of i was wondering what the best method would be to do this stuff and what materials i'd need and how in the world i would be able to shave my rear without being able to see it shaving results in a very temporary smoothness best advice is to not bother shaving it since it will come back itchy until you shave it again or let it grow all the way back nair works nice on legs and might be fine for your chest hair but never near very sensitive areas like your crotch and anus waxing results will last longer than shaving since the hair is removed from the root plus there is no razor stubble even when it grows back however it has the same risk of ingrown hairs that look like pimples electrolysis would get rid of it permanently but is expensive and not instant laser hair removal might be an option but there is much debate whether it is as permanent as electrolysis many people have reported permanent results but it depends on the person apparantly if you shave your privates mach safety type razors are best as long as you don't slide them sideways ouch i cringe at just the thought shave in the warmth of a shower stall or bathtub it may work best to do like the ladies who shave their legs and soak beforehand you will need a slippery agent shaving cream i like to use oil of olay or dove body soap for shaving my armpits and bikini area buy yourself a nice real hair bristle body brush and loofa pad to lather yourself up with as well as for exfolliation to prevent ingrown hairs take smooth firm strokes in the direction of the hair growth yeah i know it's impossible to see which direction that is use your sense of touch to feel which gives the smoothest results once you start shaving you will have plenty of future attempts to develop what works for you or else suffer the itch of the stubble  Shaving Waxing Leg shaving Hair Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Beard Baldness Strap-on dildo Razor Pseudofolliculitis barbae Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Global Gillette Anus Psoriasis Haircut Professional wrestling holds Acne Tattoo Diving Sento Mattress Hypertrichosis Violin Mosquito Professional wrestling throws The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Eczema Aerial (dance move) Jock itch Tofu Prostate cancer Drug test The Inside Breaststroke Combine (Half-Life 2) Hard water Skateboarding trick Professional wrestling attacks Late Night with Conan O'Brien Drill bit Guinea pig Cat Cross-country skiing Spanking Customs and etiquette of Japan Head shaving Dog Equine conformation Puberty Hazing Coffee Plane (tool) Woodworking Buttocks Tarantula Wound Scar 613 mitzvot Aluminium Brazilian waxing Stomach cancer Manicure Androgen insensitivity syndrome Russian joke Textile manufacturing Swimming Codename: Kids Next Door Horse Herpes simplex virus Volleyball 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Allergy Stem cell Mixed martial arts Traumatic brain injury Leather Swimming pool Car handling Hydrogen economy Manual transmission Electrology Jackass: The Movie Dairy Foodborne illness Breastfeeding Hyperthermia Drowning Malignant melanoma GunBound Kodocha Drawing Philosophy of science The Amber Spyglass

what's the difference if homosexuals are granted all the rights privileges and benefits granted to a married heterosexual couple and are granted all the rights afforded to a heterosexual couple on a state level but it would be considered a civil union rather than a marriage what is unequal about this i understand and support equality for all people and am genuinely curious as to what kind of responses this question might bring i fully support gay unions whether they end up being called civil unions or marriage doesn't matter to me either way i suppose one might look at it as asking is a ham and cheese sandwich different than a cheese and ham sandwich it's a different name but if the benefits and privileges and rights are the same what's the problem my wife and i have talked about this she's claiming that nothing less than the word marriage will do i personally don't see what the difference is as long as the benefits privileges and rights are there i forgot to include the word federal in my description if benefits were equal at both the federal and state level would there be a difference sorry for the confusion if straight couples can marry then gay couples should have the same right in terms of legal government sanctioned unions however maybe it woudl be better for government to get out of marriage altogether why not have government civil unions and church marriages that would clarify the separation between church and state as it should be note that in doing so churches woudl be free to marry gay or straight couples while the government would be compelled to register the unions of all thus freedom of religion is preserved as well as equality in th eeyes of the law for all  Same-sex marriage in Canada Marriage Federal Marriage Amendment Civil rights Separation of church and state Sexual orientation Homophobia Homosexuality and Christianity Lawrence v.

dangerous foreplay my year old lover terri and i have been a couple for a year we met while playing football with a group of lads he was on one team i was on the other his team won he told me in confidence that his uncle sexually abused him as a child and make him do things that no human should make another human do terri wants me to beat and bite him during sex foreplay as far as i know i am the only person he has told this to what can i do to help him from this nightmare and can i take the law into my own hands by hunting down his uncle i have never met terri's family yet terri is one very messed up person he used to drink all the time and take drugs from the early age of and used to 'work on the streets' until he was i really do want to help him but this is way over my head and to be honest i am kinda afraid of being with him but will it be wrong to break up with him should i have him a chance under no circumstances should you take the law into your own hands his uncle is a pig but you going after him would probably land you in some trouble as for terri what he needs is therapy if he feels comfortable with you maybe you could recomend that you go jointly but ultimately he will ahve to go alone to get the really personal stuff off of his chest and as for the question about leaving him do you love him if you love him and care enough about him try sticking with him to ensure he gets the propper attention he needs if you are not quite at the stage of love it is a difficult choice and you'll have to pick which will ultimately bring you more happiness i am assuming that since you have been together for a year that you do love him so my personal advice is to stick it out try to get him to go to therapy and just be there for him  Sin City One Tree Hill (TV series) Knots Landing Laura Schlessinger EastEnders Human sexual behavior Social rule Rape Transsexuality Pitaten Polyamory Abortion debate The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Norway national football team Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sexual orientation Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Infantilism Pedophilia Alcoholics Anonymous Dead Like Me Oasis (band) Boston Public Poker jargon Ethics Hey Jude Sex and the City Ultimate Spider-Man Neighbours Brian Close Ex-gay Shaggy dog story 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Human Stain Serial killer Zoophilia Milton H.

how angry does that make you i read this story on yahoo and it made me angry in arlington texas a memorial service was due to take place for a naval veteran who had served his country in times of war only to have his church cancel the service because they learned that he's gay so what just because he is gay doesn't mean that he doesn't have the right to a memorial service in his honor he is one of thousands who served his country in the armed forces and is a patriotic hero who deserves a religious memorial service in his church he did his patriotic duty by his country let him have his memorial service i think the church that cancelled the service hours before the service was due to begin should rethink and let the service go ahead if you want to read the article here's the link http news yahoo com s ap ap on re us gay funeral this is a perfect example of why homophobia is a sin christ commands us to treat others as we want to be treated cancelling a memorial service for a naval veteran who served his country is not treating others as anyone would want to be treated thus it violates christ's commandment and is sinful and immoral people are not born homophobic they choose to be homophobic  Religion and sexual orientation Medal of Honor Mel Gibson Gay rights Anti-gay slogan Merit Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Homosexuality and Scientology Ten Commandments Royal Air Force Vietnam Veterans Memorial John Wesley Mass (liturgy) Arlington National Cemetery John F.

someone explain to me what the goddess is and it's connection to the lesbian community the origin rituals and how widely the religion is practiced if it is a religion it's either wicca dianism dianicism or dianic wicca i would wager one of the latter two if it's being related specifically to the lesbian community wicca usually involves worship of the god and the goddess equally and is populated by both men and women dianic wicca is a combination of regular or eclectic wicca and dianism explained below because it's a longer explanation dianism also dianicism is divided into two types old dianic and feminist dianic old dianic places greater importance in the goddess and honours the god as merely her consort both women and men are included in the same group feminist dianics worship the goddess alone in her triple goddess aspects maiden mother and crone only women are allowed in the groups most are accepting of any sexual orientation but a few covens consist of only lesbians while wiccans who gather in groups or circles almost always have a high priestess high priest or both dianics usually distribute responsibility among the entire group zsuzsanna budapest is one of the pioneering mothers of feminist dianism which began in the late s contrary to the name they do not worship only diana some don't include her in their personal 'pantheon' of deities at all wicca was started by gerald gardner in the s few of its components are original has been borrowed and pieced together from 'old religions' meaning almost every pagan religion under the sun can be found in it somewhere rituals vary enormously within each type and among every group or circle there are millions of wiccans around the world though i'm not sure exactly how many dianics there are  Witchcraft Magic (paranormal) Hecate Goddess worship Anarchism and religion Feminism Zsuzsanna Budapest Sacrifice Roman mythology Diana (goddess) Horned God Triple Goddess Feminist movement Margaret Murray Paganism Gender role Lady Frieda Harris Voodoo Satanism Celtic mythology Neo-druidism Animism Gardnerian Wicca Ancient Greek religion Babylonian and Assyrian religion Polytheism Judaism Persecution of Wiccans Shinto Sexual orientation Priest The Two Babylons Homosexuality Religion God and gender Dionysus Trimurti God Mother goddess Isis Gerina Dunwich Marriage Prophet Biology and sexual orientation Greek mythology Satan Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Idolatry Magic and religion Witch-hunt Syncretism Germanic paganism Same-sex marriage Gaia (mythology) Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Sky father Baal Historical persecution by Christians Fundamentalism Thealogy Hinduism Slavic mythology El (god) Coven Religion and sexuality Lesbian Woman Demeter Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches Saint Sacred king Religious Society of Friends Matriarchy Love Aphrodite Roman Catholic Church Sabbath Maya mythology Prayer Human Wonder Woman Unitarian Universalism Wiccan Rede Mithraism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Celtic polytheism Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Religion and sexual orientation Theology 613 mitzvot Religion and mythology

why the people say it's normal to be confused when you are a teen about your sexuality your preferences after that time you know you are gay or straight i mean for example in my case all my life i always knew i was gay since i was a child but some guys i have seen in this forum the realized that they were gay until they were past the teen age for example someone who is years old says he is gay then he is confused or he is pretty sure of his sexuality or he needs to grow up more and to know the truth it is normal for the teenage years to be somewhat confusing it is usually about that time when teens discover that most adults have double standards and have no real clue about how the world operates many adults tell teens that they are confused about an issue when they really believe that they are wrong or the teen does not agree with the adults i knew from the time i was old enough to discover the difference between boys and girls that i was gay it wasn't all that confusing for me about who i was i found myself more confused about why people wouldn't just let me be who i was without judging me one of the reasons that some people are confused is that they are force fed that little boys act like this and little girls act this then when you don't feel or act like the way they say you do you do become confused with me it wasn't how come i don't feel like that it was how come they think all boys feel that way after all i didn't  Pedophilia Infantilism Transsexuality One Tree Hill (TV series) Human sexual behavior Child sexuality Gay Adolescence Age of consent Jon Secada Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Milton H.

being gay is not a choice but the bisexuality could be a choice because some people became bisexual after a long time i watched on tv a case where a guy was married but he started to feel something for the guys when he was since that case he is bisexual it's the bisexuality a choice or it's like the homosexuality nature i am gay and i am curious about bisexuality because i dont know much about that love maps are personal experience that shape one's tastes as they grow up biochemistry is dictated in the womb and some time after together they create a plethora of h mo h t and everything in btw from spanking to ball sac nailing and adult diapers human sexuality is a mess at the best of times no one usually knows why they like redheads or chests or certain types of bodies or habits and why some other types just turn them off and there isn't any way to make them like those qualities either i was lead soprano in one of the largest lesbian and gay choirs in the world in the 's you didn't have to be lesbian or gay to join sexuality was not in fact an issue but pride was we celebrated diversity in all our songs and were a major contact point for the community including pflag which is parents and friends of lesbians and gays i wasn't treated even as well as the straights because i was bi i was either a fence sitter or just mixed up but the dykes weren't comfy around me and neither were the uptight basses so i hung out with the flaming tenors all three years they at least couldn't care less i danced well and had a good time so pthhh when i confronted the president of the choir about my unfair treatment as a whole she said well you know it's just that we find your sexuality so confusing i said to her well as soon as i know i'll let you know i am now legally married to a magnificent man and we love each other so much we made a daughter live a breeder lifestyle and you have a tendency to breed i also live with my common law wife and am a guardian of her daughter our children call themselves 'sisters' in canada we may be able to pull that off in a charter challenge soon i've never met a bi that didn't think that in a perfect world everyone is really bi many gays believe deep down that we only fall in love with ourselves and gay is the best reflection of that so if everyone was free to try it we'd all be gay and of course many hets think that everyone who isn't straight just had a bad expereince that made them not like the opposite sex or makes them wear dresses or whatever 'cause it's not 'natural ' i have found pictures of women far more exciting than men since i was a child i have usually had sex with men most of my life but not always there you go i label myself bi since most straights would call me confused and most lesbians certainly would not see me as 'women loving' enough is there some reason why i have to 'pick' a camp why i have to love someone based on their genitals those are nice and all and sadly in this culture very much define a person's experiences but is that all of who they are and should that delineate who i love and how i am happy to report that the choir is now a declared lbgtq friendly in part due to my agitation stand up bi's it matters 'course they booted me first  Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Gender role Infantilism Gay rights Transgender Homosexuality and Christianity Gay Lesbian Same-sex marriage Ex-gay Homophobia Homosexuality Marriage Biology and sexual orientation LGBT Religion and sexual orientation Homosexuality and transgender Pedophilia Polyamory Strap-on dildo Transvestism Abortion debate Sex education Queer Coming out Slash fiction Homosexuality and Judaism Anal sex Friends Reparative therapy Shaggy dog story Same-sex marriage in Canada Heteronormativity Child sexual abuse Theory of conduct North American Man/Boy Love Association One Tree Hill (TV series) Gay rights timeline Religion and sexuality EastEnders Age of consent Domestic violence Homosexuality and medical science BDSM Heterosexuality Zoophilia Swinging Child sexuality Queer as Folk (U.S.) Pornographic movie Gay community Incest Singapore gay equality movement Laura Schlessinger Human sexuality Badly Drawn Kitties Social rule Demographics of sexual orientation Humphrey Bogart Asexuality Avenue Q Don't ask, don't tell Kyle Broflovski Spanking Theodicy Pornography Homosexuality in China Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Effeminacy Section 28 Little Britain James Dobson Gay bathhouse History of sex Group sex Drag queen Same-sex marriage in the United States Will & Grace Stewie Griffin Boston Public Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) The Ashlee Simpson Show Bondage (BDSM) Nudity Kylie Minogue Homosexuality and Islam Urinary incontinence Human Lawrence v.

why are you all not as frightened by these questions as i am please read page after page of questions asked here all i see is young people scared to death by the thought that they are gay what kind of world have we as gays allowed to rise up around us we have been in this revolt business for years now and we seem to have gone nowhere in a handbasket i see questions about gay pride sickening rebuttal to what these parades accomplish fear of being gay because of what the religious right has instilled in our country in the last decades and so much more where is the equality it isn't just about marriage it is about life when and how do you plan on actually making changes in the world according to gay you don't even get out and vote what kind of world are you leaving behind when you care only enough to gripe about our plight but not enough to do something about it and yes i am mad as hell at you gays you have overwhelming power yet you squander it by doing nothing except writing here at ya goldwing great question but you went on a lot more than you usually do this has really gotten under your skin of course that's ok means you actually have feelings are not afraid of them good on you mate and fear i believe is the motivation in the heart of the young people who write in with the hundreds of am i gay questions all of us struggle with conflicts within especially at the age range they are seeking some help in making the choice judgement on their current and future sexuality too bad their parents couldn't do a better job but that's where they are at and where we were all at some of us are still there frozen by fear even if there was no anti gay sentiment on our society they would still struggle with the question of their orientation true one fear would not be active the fear of being rejected or outcast by the friends and family and you are correct to note that this fear is alive and kicking in them as they struggle with their sexual identity same thing happens in young people who are considering a spiritual path different from their family of origin or culture i don't think society's thinking can be changed much and i'm not optimistic about the ability of activism to change it quickly but society's thinking does change by itself meanwhile what we can do it teach young kids how to learn to overcome and walk through their fears making them strong men and women who can confidently make their choices even if there are unpleasant consequences today peace and to thine own self be true  Sexual orientation Gay rights Human sexual behavior Homosexuality and Christianity Transsexuality Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Ex-gay Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Gender role Religion and sexual orientation Religion Same-sex marriage Avenue Q A Course In Miracles Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Gay Social rule Homosexuality Friends Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Ten Commandments Religious pluralism Meaning of life Abortion debate Humphrey Bogart Domestic violence Goodness and value theory Pacifism Pitaten The Death Gate Cycle EastEnders Opus Dei Simone Weil YuYu Hakusho Anthroposophy Political correctness Kim Possible Milton H.

do you think gay pride parades actually hurt the cause for gay marriage it seems that these gay pride parades where half naked people dance through the streets with bright colors and dance suggestively would actually hurt the cause for gay marriage they wanted to be treated equal and get equal rights but then act like kooks do you think this actually enforces many negative stereotypes i do not think that gay pride parades or any other pride events hurt the cause for gay marriage but i do think that the media portrayal of pride parades and pride events enforce stereotypes when i went to the pride event in my city it consisted of numerous gay couples and families when the local newspaper covered it the most outlandish and stereotypical picture was published without any mention of the couples and families who attended  Gay rights Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Gay rights timeline Lesbian Pride parade Gay community Gay pride Homophobia Drag queen Same-sex marriage in Spain Homosexuality in China Federal Marriage Amendment Rave party North American Man/Boy Love Association Marvin Gaye Homosexuality Political correctness Gender role Same-sex marriage in Canada Gay Nudity Human sexual behavior Singapore gay equality movement Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Defense of Marriage Act New England Salt Lake City, Utah Gay village Same-sex marriage University of Tennessee New Orleans Mardi Gras Religion and sexuality Stonewall riots Swinging Westheimer Street Festival Brigham Young University Carnival Rainbow flag Log Cabin Republicans Bisexuality Church and Wellesley Outing Stereotype Racial segregation Same-sex marriage in the United States Civil union Gay bar Transsexuality Sexual orientation Gay rights in Iraq Egale Canada Same-sex marriage in New York Yoko Ono Skinhead Marriage Asperger syndrome Divorce Cyndi Lauper Gay slang Saint Patrick's Day Queer National Day Parade Blackface Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Queer as Folk (U.S.) Domestic violence Quentin Crisp History of the Gay Community Civil unions in Ireland Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Civil unions in Vermont Homosexuality and medical science Harlem Renaissance Same-sex marriage in Alberta Age of consent Equal Protection Clause Religion and sexual orientation Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Democratic Party (United States) Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 Lynbrook High School East is East Cranford, New Jersey Andrew Sullivan Section 28 Bouvier sisters Chinatown History of South Africa in the apartheid era Berlin Electric Six Nerd Civil rights The Sun Diana Ross Asian fetish Polyamory Pride and Prejudice

what's up with using lgbt vs glbt like some people use lgbt and others use glbt i personally think lgbt is easier to say with it starting with a vowel but then some say glbt maybe it goes by more commonly recognized because there are less transgendered than there are lesbian but i believe there are more bisexuals than all of them and i think the lesbian and gay population is pretty equal so it should go blgt maybe ladies first i meant to say starting with a vowel sound not vowel typo maybe they should just be ontop of eachother like a fraction but then people would start fighting over whod be on top lmao maybe it should be tlbg to make everyone happy but someone would fight about that too make love not warr  LGBT Gay community Gay Bisexuality Homosexuality Gay rights Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Gay slang Queer Sexual orientation Homophobia Transvestism National Gay and Lesbian Taskforce Human Rights Campaign Violence against gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and the transgendered Transgender Lambda Literary Award Pride parade Drag queen Metropolitan Community Church Egale Canada Coming out Same-sex marriage Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Homosexuality and transgender Transsexuality Lesbian Wilson Cruz Homosexuality in Singapore Gay pride Welcoming Congregation Queer theology Sex education The Celluloid Closet Gay rights timeline Gender role Homosexuality and Christianity Same-sex marriage in the United States Section 28 Harvey Milk Liberal Democrats (UK) Logo (TV channel) Homosexuality and Neopaganism International Lesbian and Gay Association Church and Wellesley Vowel Marriage Pronoun game Homosexuality and Scientology Dyke (lesbian) Reparative therapy Transwoman Lesbian feminism Homosexuality and Judaism Day of Silence Heteronormativity Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto Heterophobia London Lesbian and Gay Centre Anal sex Vowel length Phoneme Two-Spirit Gay-Straight Alliance Homosexuality laws of the world Gay agenda CSI: Crime Scene Investigation Autogynephilia Feminism Europride Diacritic Ohio Wesleyan University History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Korean language The closet Log Cabin Republicans Non-native pronunciations of English George Hislop History of the Gay Community Religion and sexual orientation BDSM Ex-gay Same-sex marriage in Spain Civil unions in Ireland Heterosexuality Homosexuality in China Montrose, Houston Human sexual behavior Libby Davies Group sex Hangul Wheel of Fortune Slash fiction Outing Transphobia Terminology of homosexuality Gay village Pinyin Stonewall (UK) Alyson Publications

has your lgbt status ever affected someone else in a negative way i don't mean have they suddenly not become your friend because of your sexuality take for example my year old niece me and her mother and father have always been open about my sexuality in the hope that she wouldn't develop a negative attitude towards lgbt people so she isn't afraid of who knows she has a cool gay uncle but as soon as the kids at her school got wind of it she was bullied about it this went on for months before she told anyone and to her credit she never once said she hated me which is what they wanted to make her do naturally i felt incredibly guilty but it's not like i could've done much about it have any of your friends family or work colleagues been affected like this and how did it make you feel when you found out i appreciate your input longview but my ten year old niece was bullied which is only ever a negative thing my sexuality is the thing that just is the fact she was bullied for something that she wasn't even involved in is negative in my eyes well longview i apologise if my edit seemed a little terse it certainly wan't intentional it's just something i feel very emotional about it actually happened to my mother some of her friends would distance themselves from her because of me i don't claim to have a close relationship with her but i was deeply hurt that her friends would distance themselves due to me i quickly turned that situation around and took her out to a nice brunch at the ritz carlton and she forgot all about her snotty friends as they have never been to the ritz for brunch and now she has some braggin' rights lol  Homophobia EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) The Smoking Room About a Boy Ranma __ characters Theory of conduct Knots Landing Recurring South Park characters Social rule Bully Friends LGBT Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Gay Sexual orientation Kodocha Springfield Elementary School Shaggy dog story Ex-gay The Amber Spyglass Pet Sounds Stuttering Transactional analysis Humphrey Bogart Gay community Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Jon Secada The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Little Britain Domestic violence Kyle Broflovski Polyamory Cardcaptor Sakura Boston Public Infantilism Honey and Clover Hip hop rivalries Traumatic incident reduction Peter Pan Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Blood on the Tracks Laura Schlessinger Mystique (comics) The Marshall Mathers LP Pedophilia Sigmund Freud Section 28 Plame affair Germaine Greer AFI 100 Years series Fruits Basket Marilyn Monroe Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Gender role Child sexuality Kurt Cobain Maison Ikkoku Sex and the City Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Prisoner's dilemma Piccolo Junior Saga Charmed Zoophilia Ten Commandments The Adventures of Pete & Pete W.I.T.C.H.

is it possible for the gay and christian world to find unity the answer is yes i know this sounds really pushy but i just got back from chautauqua and i saw this amazing movie by dan karslake called for the bible tells me so it is very much pro gay and it is very much pro religion www forthebibletellsmeso org it interviews five very normal very christian very american families who have enough insight to accept their gay children it talks about literalism and how people take the bible and use it as a weapon like how being gay is considered quote an abomination and then a page later eating shrimp and wearing linen and wool together is an abomination the bible was made thousands of years ago and back then population was declining and gay relationships aren't exactly baby making ones back then abomination meant going against custom it was against custom to eat certain foods and wear certain clothes and to waste semen where it was desperately needed needless to say the population emergency has deflated and now gays lesbians bisexuals and transgendered people everywhere are facing prejudice and we get bible verses shoved in our faces any time we act out against it but you know what the bible was written by people and now it is being misinterpreted by people and they need to be educated we need more priests or bishops like gene robertson that's why i telling you all about this film i want it to get as many viewers as possible i want it in every movie theater across america but it needs your help now if it doesn't make money now film makers can't bump it up to the big screen so check out the website and look for local viewings and spread the word spread the message show christianity for what it should be gay friendly hi there brandy i completely and utterly agree with you as a university graduate who read history i have found that the bible is a great history book however it is as you say open to much misinterpretation people certainly do take the bible and use it as a weapon in the time when the bible was written culture and attitudes were very different then as were the meanings and definitions of certain words just as you have given as an example in the word 'abomination ' people take the bible too literally and adapt the 'meanings' to suit their attitudes i will certainly look out for this film and pass on the message all the best o  Homosexuality and Christianity Gay Lesbian Christianity New Testament Bible Homophobia Nation of Islam Criticisms of Christianity Religion and sexual orientation Book of Mormon Creationism Gender role A Course In Miracles Transgender Anglican views of homosexuality Same-sex marriage Biblical inerrancy Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Friends Infantilism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Pornographic movie Literature Korban Gay rights Same-sex marriage in Canada Evolutionary creationism Arab Alan Campbell (pastor) Gay slang Judaism Seventh-day Adventist Church Social rule Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Book of Isaiah Human sexual behavior Religion and sexuality Abrahamic religion Fundamentalism Literacy Transsexuality Homosexuality and Scientology EastEnders Polygamy Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Moses Societal attitudes towards homosexuality The Amazing Race Effeminacy History of sex Religion Motion picture rating system Christianity and anti-Semitism Book of Daniel Jew Urantia Little Britain Unitarian Universalism Marriage Queer Idolatry Creation according to Genesis Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Mormonism and Judaism Moloch Jewish principles of faith Ramakrishna Bible translations Old Testament Intelligent design Discordianism Jerry Falwell Biblical studies Christian right Sabbath The Two Babylons Margaret Cho Section 28 Mahatma Gandhi Homosexuality in China Genesis Theology Predestination

a question about gay marraige i'm just curious if the issue on gay marraige is more about having the legal rights of any other married couple or not being married in a christian church sorry if this question seems stupid i just don't follow this topic in the news because i already know where i stand in case you're wondering i think it's great if they want to commit to each other they can have all the same legal rights as everyone else they'll probably take their relationship more seriously than most heterosexual people do anyway have families be happy that's wonderful i'm just not so sure the christian church is the setting since god has already made it perfectly clear he's not okay with it it just seems like we're asking to be struck down by lightening i've always tried to be open minded it's not my place to judge others and i would never consider hating someone just because of who they choose to love so is it the church marraige that's the issue or getting government acknowledgement please note i'm just trying to understand the issue nothing more nothing less thanks in advance for helping me understand i just want government acknowledgment which i actually already have where i live woo hoo and the same benefits as any other married couple i do not believe the church should be forced to marry same sex couples if thier doctrine is against homosexuality i mean come on as gay people we are being told what we can and can't do and we hate it the church feels the same way  Same-sex marriage Marriage Homosexuality and Christianity Religion and sexual orientation Civil union Sexual orientation Human sexual behavior Federal Marriage Amendment Lawrence v.

why many are enjoying and othewrs are surffering you mean why is there inequality generally or are you talking about lgbt issues we are individuals there is no easy way around that and none is wanted people who have money should be encouraged to be generous but the suffering of others does not always lead to generosity sometimes it leads to contempt sometimes it leads to a big bureaucratic mess which may or may not relieve their suffering sometimes it leads to slick promoters who use those suffering people to line their own pockets the best way to help others is locally if you are distressed about poverty homelessness hunger start in your own neighborhood your own town there are charitable organizations which are run by local people and you can volunteer donate food donate money donate your time the local people know what they need and want whereas large international organizations tend to be rather top heavy and aid is too likely to fall into the hands of corrupt officials of course we need to help people elsewhere also but the best way to do that may well be to buy hand made products they have made or support the few large organizations which are very much in the public eye and scrutiny such as the international red cross there will never been complete economic equality as people have different needs different abilities and different living conditions but we can help if we want to  Aid American Red Cross Non-governmental organization Poverty Capitalism Marshall Plan Politics of the United States Hurricane Katrina disaster relief Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Mother Teresa Organic farming International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement AmeriCorps Political corruption Food and Drug Administration 2005 Kashmir earthquake Live 8 Economy of Africa Inflation Free trade Breastfeeding Famine United Church of Christ Libertarian socialism Anarchism and capitalism Development aid Henry Dunant Affirmative action Live Aid Cultural Revolution Publicly funded medicine Campaign finance reform Microcredit Humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Elections in the United States International response to Hurricane Katrina Microeconomics Poverty line Great Depression Non-profit organization Comic Relief Externality Japanese Occupation of Hong Kong Homophobia Economic inequality Criticisms of socialism MoveOn Humanist Movement Past and present anarchist communities Wealth International Monetary Fund Charitable trust Health insurance Community emergency response team Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Poker jargon Food security Volunteerism Make Poverty History LGBT Economic anthropology Paternalism Philippine general election, 2004 Anarchism and society United Nations Kibbutz Campaign finance in the United States Mail fraud Organ donation Habitat for Humanity International Bretton Woods system Independence Party (Iceland) Fundraising Canadian federal election, 1993 St. John Ambulance Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Osama bin Laden Gift economy Amnesty International Economy of India Education in the United States Keynesian economics Local food Progressive tax Church of Scientology Globalization Public policy Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Liberal Democrats (UK) National Gay and Lesbian Taskforce Economy of Nigeria Battle of Stalingrad Political economy Utilitarianism Education in the People's Republic of China Gross domestic product Juliana of the Netherlands

what would your followup question be to the democratic candidates if you could ask candidate a follow up question who would it be and what would you ask i would ask this senator obama considering your stance on same sex marriage you stated civil union gives all the same rights as civil marriage so it is equal do you consider sitting in the back of the bus or drinking from the colored water fountain okay because you still get to ride the bus and you still get to drink some water your logic says it would be equal and fair disclaimer i understand my example is a bit harsh but to many in the lgbt community it feels the same to us mistermoo i thought i was the only one that caught that i would repeal article of doma after every other candidate said scrap doma i think she does not want to harm her hubbies legacy tab h i posted a slightly revised version on visiblevote http visiblevote logoonline com video the candidates on gay marriage comment i like obama's stance other than this minute ramble suggesting separate but equal that he gave last night i am hoping that after he thinks about it he can further explain his views my followup would be for senator clinton why would you only suggest a repeal of part of doma rather than the whole thing it is an entirely discriminatory piece of legislation edit believe me a lot of people noticed that i think quite frankly i believe she is correct in the defense that she gave of approving doma to begin with that without doma we would currently be looking at an approved constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage it is much easier to repeal a law especially an unconstitutional one than a constitutional amendment but i think that the time for doma has passed and it is now time to push for equality  Defense of Marriage Act Same-sex marriage in the United States Federal Marriage Amendment Lawrence v.

how do i explain my bi sexuallity to my friends and family i am and i have both a girlfriend and a boyfriend and i don't know how to tell my family about my relationships the reason i ask is beacuse my family has invited me to come over for a family dinner and i don't know who to bring my gf or my bf or both but how would i explain that to my mom and dad why not wait a while i don't really think there is any rule that you have to tell your family about your sexual desires and preferences it's way too much information for them anyway if you tell them then be prepared for them to get involved in your private business the only person in this world that knows my fantasies and what turns me on and i like all kinds of things is my wife i think some things should stay private let me ask you this do your boyfriend and girlfriend know about each other i am guessing they don't but if they do more power to you that should be enough honesty to make you happy without involving your family who are most likely going to judge you for it anway  Infantilism Theory of conduct Phoebe Buffay's songs One Tree Hill (TV series) Human sexual behavior The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sexual orientation Calvin and Hobbes Current teachings of Prem Rawat The O.C.

homophobes are doing us a favor before i came out i was very sensitive to a criticism from religious zealots and homophobes as i grew stronger and older i have become immune to their attacks and poison i was only trying harder to become independent and succeed my skin got thicker and i can care less what they have to say i realize that its hypocrisy religious people to encourage hatred by no means i agree with violence and hate crimes but could it be that they are to a degree helping to create awareness making us stronger and helping others to hear our voice there would be no action without reaction force so let them post their stupid rants allow them to expose their rotten souls allow them to dig their own grave robin w i agree with you believe me i wish i wouldn't have to experience it but reality is that they are here and we have to deal with it s h a w n i e they are not here to help us i know that delarious demarcus this is what we want coexist they don't intend to make gays stronger they don't try to benefit them at all though in the long run they do homophobic people are sad to say ignorant and have probably grown up in an environment where they were taught homosexuality was wrong however you have a very optimistic insight about things and keep being strong because the stronger they may make you the better for homosexuals all over the world  Homophobia Religion The Marshall Mathers LP Boston Public Laura Schlessinger Human sexual behavior Gay rights Evil Christian right Homosexuality and Christianity Opposition to cults and new religious movements Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Religion and sexuality Force (Star Wars) Heteronormativity The Death Gate Cycle Criticism of libertarianism Capital punishment Domestic violence Outing Homosexuality and Scientology Homosexuality and Judaism Religion and sexual orientation Liberalism Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Rick Santorum Hillary Rodham Clinton Simone Weil Pacifism Sexual orientation Fathers' rights Narcissism Mahatma Gandhi A Course In Miracles Self-hatred Blood (computer game) Religious Society of Friends Characters in the Smurfs David Hume Homosexuality Violence against gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and the transgendered Infidels Richard Littlejohn Psychosis Little Britain Anglican views of homosexuality Sin Animal rights Jonathan Wild Freedom of speech Al-Ghazali Slashdot trolling phenomena Reparative therapy John Kerry presidential campaign, 2004 The Authority Jon Secada Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Atheism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Ranma __ characters John Edwards Section 28 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sharon Tate British National Party Fred Phelps Brother Bear Ethical consumerism Hate group YuYu Hakusho Scientology beliefs and practices Anne Rice Libertarianism Dilbert Plame affair Children of Dune Surveillance Sin City Value system Emperor Guangwu of Han Camille Paglia Anarchism and society Aesthetic Realism Concepts in the Wheel of Time series Bill Maher Subud Ren and Stimpy Recurring South Park characters Arguments for and against drug prohibition Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Separation of church and state EastEnders The Shield Transsexuality 2004 Republican National Convention Kain (Legacy of Kain)

i was asked the other day how a father could prevent a young son from catching homosexuality whats the ans he wondered whether a parochial school might prevent it homosexuality is very contagious and it's smart to be thinking prevention at an early age people don't call it a disease but if i were to go into restaurants and take a dump on the counter but then say it's only a lifestyle i'd be taken to a mental institution reason being it's out of the normal a mental illness homosexuality is the same and there are roughly billion homosexuals on the planet as i answer this is a pandemic disease and not something to take lightly it's best to keep the young boy in doors and encourage him to date girls do not i repeat do not let him shower with other boys that is extremely dangerous and a leading cause of experimentation  Mental illness Sexual orientation Pedophilia Infantilism Human sexual behavior Masturbation Alfred Kinsey Psychiatric hospital H5N1 Sex education Anorexia nervosa Influenza Duesberg hypothesis Avian influenza Homophobia Childlove movement Reparative therapy Disease Homosexuality and Islam Teen Girl Squad Gay The Catcher in the Rye Lou Gehrig Little Britain Hypoglycemia Factory farming Bubonic plague Transsexuality Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Ex-gay Prostate cancer Bisexuality Involuntary commitment Dragons (Pern) Dieting Dead Like Me James Dobson Smallpox Friends Bipolar disorder Child sexual abuse Methamphetamine Pandemic Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Hypertension Oz (TV series) The Jazz Singer Theory of conduct Psoriasis Rape Anti-gay slogan Shaggy dog story National Institutes of Health Scientology beliefs and practices History of sex Homosexuality Spanish flu Homosexuality and Judaism Diabetes mellitus Vaccine Hikikomori Infectious disease Homosexuality in China Age of consent Butters Stotch AIDS reappraisal Clinical depression Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Milton H.

do you think some in the gay community overreacted to eharmony do you think eharmony has the right to maintain its policy as the founder is a fundamentalist christian and has particular beliefs or do you think eharmony should be forced to change its policy to allow gays to match up even if it is a free enterprise and gays can start their own dating sites which they already have as i see on the net also why is it ok for gays to have exclusivity on their dating sites but not eharmony while i'm very liberal i do believe that eharmony has the right to run its business the way it sees fit and please no gay bashing if a guy starts a business selling tires for toyotas should lexus owners be able to force him to sell lexus tires too its ridiculous to try to force someone to change their business plan just because its not inclusive of someones elses sexual choices his product is matching up heterosexual people it would be stupid tomake him change his product he has a market share and doesn't feel inclined to expand it its not a legal issue its just gays looking for more special rights  Sexual orientation Homosexuality and Christianity Human sexual behavior Toyota Motor Corporation Religion and sexual orientation Gay rights Gay Intellectual property Libertarianism Capitalism Homosexuality American Conservatism Same-sex marriage in Canada Toyota Prius Trademark Gay community Reparative therapy Same-sex marriage Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Fan fiction Ex-gay Hybrid vehicle Microsoft Gender role Democracy Federal Marriage Amendment Homophobia Liberal Democrats (UK) Separation of church and state Queer Privatization Domestic violence Laura Schlessinger Transsexuality Homosexuality and Judaism Polyamory Democratic Party (United States) Heterosexuality Mazda Pedophilia Conservatism Feminism Civil rights Lexus Homosexuality in China Biology and sexual orientation Bi-curious LGBT Aesthetic Realism Transgender Outing Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Liberalism Coming out Defense of Marriage Act Mazda Miata American individualist anarchism Lawrence v.

how does less than equal equal full equality last night i heard several democrat frontrunners state they are for equality for all but do not support gay marriage how do they justify this simple math teaches that what is not fully equal is unequal yet many of these folks seem to really believe they support equality do you believe legalizing civil unions on a national scale but not gay marriages equates to equal rights i mean if they made civil unions on a federal level and let churches call them marriages if they so chose to then i would be fine with that that would mean that nonreligious straight people would get civil unions too that i support civil unions but not marriages is a bunch of crap and is separate but equal well actually just separate  Same-sex marriage in Canada Same-sex marriage Civil union Same-sex marriage in the United States Democratic Party (United States) Federal Marriage Amendment Gay rights Defense of Marriage Act Civil unions in Vermont Separation of church and state Homosexuality and Christianity American Civil Liberties Union Civil unions in Ireland Civil unions in the United Kingdom Rick Santorum Same-sex marriage in Australia Constitution Same-sex marriage in Alberta Congress of the United States Divorce Equal Protection Clause Same-sex marriage in New York Civil Marriage Act Civil rights Liberal Democrats (UK) Centre Party (Germany) Sexual orientation NAACP Homosexuality and Judaism Gay rights timeline Same-sex marriage timeline Homophobia Homosexuality Fathers' rights Desegregation Libertarianism Same-sex marriage in Spain Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Libertarian Party (United States) Mary Robinson Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom United States Constitution Democracy United States Senate European Convention on Human Rights Religion and sexual orientation John Kerry presidential campaign, 2004 Government of India Common-law marriage American individualist anarchism Plessy v.

the bisexual conundrum do they exist i have seen more times than i can count 'bisexuals are just confused blah blah' what are your thoughts jamu we have to stop meeting like this the neighbours will talk j k i know that i am bisexual and that i am not confused you are right this is something that is brought up quite a lot according to alot of people bisexuals are either confused or nymphomaniacs i am neither confused nor a nymphomaniac what surprises me is that this is not just an argument i have heard from straights but gays as well i always thought gays would be more understanding but they are trying to force me to be something i am not just as any straight would i will never try to be some one i am not i have known for years that i am physically attracted to both males and females it is as simple as that i don't understand why some people cannot seen to make sense of this especially the gays who feel we are confused or not accepting our true gayness i am who i am i love my self i am proud of my self i will never pretend to be any one but my self for any one and i will not hide that i am bisexual because some people to not seem to think it exists every one should love and respect not only them selves but every one around them i am a bisexual women and i love a bisexual man we have been together for years and i love him fully i have no issues with commitment or monogamy should he want monogamy that would be fine i could spend the rest of my life with him and him alone currently how ever we are both open we have brought long time partners into our relationship note that i said partner not play mate these were women that we cared about emotionally and enjoyed physically threesomes do not have to be purely sexual and for us they are not they are emotional full of caring and love how ever despite that we have formed such relationships in the past does not mean that we could not be monogamous with each other and in all honesty that is how we started out the first was a close dearly loved friend of ours we helped her heal her emotional wounds with support and friendship she asked us if we could be more after my fiance and i talked about it she became a third in our relationship we did truly love her time and family brought us our different ways and to different coasts so perhaps that only proves that bisexuals cannot be happy with out both well it doesn't we have never shared out bed with a second man my fiance as i said is bisexual and finds men physically attractive but we've never shared our bed with a man because we have never bonded so closely with a man as we did that female friend of ours we are happy with just each other we don't need any one else but we do not limit the extent our love can spread either  Sexual orientation Polyamory Marriage Infantilism Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Gay Polygamy Monogamy Gender role Swinging Homophobia Homosexuality and Christianity Transgender Reparative therapy Ex-gay Zoophilia Interpersonal relationship EastEnders Avenue Q Transsexuality Anal sex Same-sex marriage Group sex Friendship Gay slang God Emperor of Dune Social rule Domestic violence Lesbian Homosexuality and transgender Friends BDSM The Invisibles Coming out About a Boy Love Sex and the City William Shakespeare Religion and sexuality Homosexuality and Judaism Homosexuality and Islam Socrates Vulcan (Star Trek) Asexuality Heterosexuality Gay rights Jon Secada The nature of God in Western theology History of sex LGBT Gay bathhouse The Smoking Room American Psycho Theory of conduct The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Homosexuality and Neopaganism The Amber Spyglass Oscar Wilde Theodicy Dead Like Me Pitaten K' Rent (musical) Orgasm Divorce Will & Grace Another Side of Bob Dylan Domination & submission (BDSM) Pedophilia Jiddu Krishnamurti Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Laura Schlessinger Simone Weil Borderline personality disorder Phoebe Buffay's songs Ten Commandments Humphrey Bogart 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Marvin Gaye Shaggy dog story Physical attractiveness Kodocha Past teachings of Prem Rawat Little Britain I, the Jury Bi-curious Biology and sexual orientation Abortion debate T'Pol Knots Landing Stewie Griffin Fathers' rights Gay community

the presidential debate last night were glbt people satisfied with answers or disappointed we lost our power because of a big storm and i couldn't watch it what did i miss mike gravel does support same sex marriage and feels like the marriage issue is not even going to be an issue in yrs and understands there should be no ban on who marries who because marriage humans being in love and wanting to make a commitment says that the only way to stop the hatred and bigotry is for all gays to come out of the closet and assert their rights he thinks that the older americans are wrong to say flat out that homosexuality is wrong and that he tells them so the only real thing i disagreed with is that he wants to legalize all of the illegal drugs and makes it where doctors can prescribe them like medical marijuana but i don't think that will work very well with meth and some of the other stuff out there today and he didn't say one single thing about health care dennis kucinich also supports same sex marriage wants real equality believes that sexual orientation doesn't matter and will abolish the discrimination in the workplace wants a not for profit medicare system for long term health care and wants to take on the aids issue john edwards wants health care benefits for all low income and the lgbt community the only problem i saw was when he was astounded that in l a some lgbt teens had been kicked out of there homes and made homeless because their parents didn't agree with their sexual orientation supports trangender issues and wants to make it where there is no discrimination in the workplace wants to get rid of the don't ask don't tell but is against same sex marriages and wants to make sure that gay hate crimes are prosecuted bill richardson believes in domestic unions with marriage benefits but not marriage itself wants to abolish don't ask don't tell passed hate crimes act in new mexico for domestic partners the only major thing that he said that nobody will agree with in the lgbt community is that homosexuality is a choice he also believes that everybody should have equal rights hillary clinton wants to get rid of don't ask don't tell and said that the reason that she didn't try for it earlier is because she knew that it would not pass in the republican congress believes that sexual orientation doesn't matter in the service wouldn't put somebody that is anti gay in the jointy chiefs the only downers for her was that she still thinks that the states should have th final say on same sex marriage but she is against it and that she skimmed over the hate crime issue and the workplace discrimination issue  Homophobia Homosexuality Human sexual behavior Hillary Rodham Clinton Federal Marriage Amendment Religion and sexual orientation Same-sex marriage in Canada Homosexuality and Christianity U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Transsexuality Homosexuality and Judaism Gay rights timeline Lawrence v.

okay so who watched the presidential forum on logo and what did u think i watched it but i'm disappointed that i fell asleep before hillary came on so i need to read what she actually said i have and still am an obama supporter however i was less than pleased on his answers or his lack of actually giving answers the two underdogs running are the ones that actually should be president but they are way to idealistic for mainstream america john edward is fake he just recently supports gays for the votes no less while i think the forum was good i don't feel like i learned anything new about the candidates i did find it interesting but not surprising that none of the republican candidates accepted the invitation for a similar forum this country with all its benefits is still really friggin screwed up juan i'm surprised i really didn't get that feeling from her she was professional and upfront with her questions just as a side note the debate can still be watched at http visiblevote logoonline com obama looked uncomfortable for someone that says he is our champion i liked his answers for the most part but was unsettled by how uncomfortable he appeared edwards came off fake and rehearsed he had sound bites and he aired them to us kucinich presented himself exactly like he is this man is open and honest if he could deliver the message better he would be a front runner gravel came off similar to kucinich i think he would make a great talk show host the guy had me laughing and admiring him at years old i do not think he could win but i was impressed with his candor richardson this man is a bought and paid for politician when he would not commit to signing a marriage bill if it were sitting on his desk that sealed his fate he is pandering for votes but not ours clinton she came off sweet and caring delivery is excellent but when you look at her words there is not a lot of substance there i see the same maneuvering with words that we saw from some other candidates i wasn't impressed overall of the front runners obama is the only one that impressed me of the other kucinich won my heart and mind he now has my vote i learned to listen when i went to a sales course many years ago if you listen to the words they always tell true story  2004 Democratic National Convention Democratic Party (United States) U.S. presidential election, 2008 U.S. Democratic Party presidential nomination, 2004 Barack Obama Alan Keyes Hillary Rodham Clinton Dennis Kucinich U.S. presidential election, 2004 The Daily Show Bill Clinton Social rule Jesse Jackson Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Plame affair 2004 Republican National Convention Late Night with Conan O'Brien Ralph Nader Ted Kennedy Shaggy dog story Ross Perot Current teachings of Prem Rawat Avenue Q Russ Feingold Theory of conduct Howard Dean Humphrey Bogart Federal Marriage Amendment Have I Got News For You John Kerry presidential campaign, 2004 U.S. Senate election, 2004 The Ashlee Simpson Show Blood on the Tracks Same-sex marriage in Canada Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Past teachings of Prem Rawat U.S. Senate election, 2006 Third party (United States) Karl Rove Pat Buchanan John Kerry Whose Line Is It Anyway? 2004 Iowa Democratic caucuses The Contender (television series) Bill O'Reilly (commentator) U.S. presidential election, 2000 ROC presidential election, 2004 U.S. Electoral College Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Empire Burlesque Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Condoleezza Rice Friends Melanie Wilkes Socrates Noam Chomsky United States House of Representatives Vice President of the United States Kurt Cobain Jerry Brown Sinfest Major League Baseball television contracts Pet Sounds Red state vs. blue state divide Sharon Tate The Apprentice 2 2000 Australian Grand Prix Paul Is Dead Bill Frist Zell Miller Same-sex marriage in the United States EastEnders Heinkel He 112 George W.
