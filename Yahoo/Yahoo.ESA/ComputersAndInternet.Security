what is the purpose for quarantine if the spyware virus is quarantined does it mean that its deleted from my computer and if i go to the quarantine box and check remove does that mean that the virus is deleted or sent back to infect files im sorry guys im not really computer literate when you quarantine a file you place it in a specific folder that your antivirus is watching it cannot copy itself worms normally do this and the file cannot be executed from an outside file i e another piece of the virus that may not have been found yet viruses or bugs get placed into quarantine when they don't have a way to heal the file some viruses change other files and infect them rather then deleting an important file that's infected you can sometimes heal from the virus and still have a perfectly fine file without the problems of the virus by quarantineing an infected file you can then fix the file and return it back to normal operation without deleting an important file when you remove a file from quarantine you are deleting it off your computer  Computer virus Malware Anti-virus software Windows XP Computer security Spyware Trojan horse (computing) Stopping e-mail abuse Rootkit Microsoft Windows Computer worm Quarantine File system Mydoom Filename extension Software bug Trusted computing Virus Java programming language File Allocation Table ITunes Linked list Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Computer file Windows 2000 Library (computer science) Internet security CIH virus System/34 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome System/36 E-mail spam Blue screen of death Bluetooth Mouse (computing) OS/2 NX bit Surveillance Resident Evil Outbreak Diablo II: Lord of Destruction C programming language Hash table World of Warcraft Resident Evil Outbreak: File 2 Macintosh Finder Gmail AmigaOS MDAC Peer-to-peer Virtual memory Backup PaX Computer Internet Explorer System 7 (Macintosh) Pneumonia Common criticisms of Microsoft Outlook Express Medical prescription Cytomegalovirus Sobig worm Magic number (programming) Cascading Style Sheets Kazaa E-mail Progress of the SARS outbreak MegaMan Battle Network (video game) Buffer overflow Foodborne illness Steam (content delivery) CPU cache Timeline of notable computer viruses and worms H5N1 John Sheppard (Stargate) History of Microsoft Windows Software testing Host file Enterprise content management Red-black tree HyperCard Mac OS X Rabies File format USB flash drive Hacker (computer security) The Cursed Videotape Computer surveillance Screensaver Directory Spam (electronic) JavaScript Morris worm Web crawler Partition (computing) HIV test

this is what happens to me used with permission from numbersix printing this would be helpful you need not follow this in exact order or even do all the steps but it was written this way to ensure all issues where handled if you find one portion particularly helpful for removing a problem please email me step don't panic take a deep breath and go grab a cup of your favorite beverage this may take awhile step clean up your pc remove programs you don't use via the add remove programs in the control panel in vista you remove programs by clicking programs and features in the control panel if you are unsure of a particular program you can check it against a list of offenders here http forums majorgeeks com showthread php t clean your hard drive of unnecessary files using ccleaner here http www ccleaner com download save to your desktop install it then run the cleaner simple yet it will free up tons of space on your hard drive while you have the program open run the registry checker as well this will fix invalid registry entries safely note that you should run ccleaner for all accounts on your pc step create a new system restore point click start all programs accessories system tools system restore create a restore point now delete all but this most recent restore point click start all programs accessories system tools disk cleanup click more options tab and then under system restore click clean up click yes to remove all but the most recent restore point click ok click yes and then click ok step now let's start to get rid of those nasties download the following programs to your desktop you should then install each one but don't run them yet patience patience lavasoft's ad aware from here http www lavasoftusa com products ad a avg anti spyware from here http www ewido net en download spybot search and destroy from here http www safer networking org en downl superantispyware from here http www superantispyware com i know this seems like overkill but until someone can come up with one program that can detect everything in the wild we need to use programs from several reputable sources step use them safely once these programs are installed on your pc their effectiveness may be negated by running scans normally you need to reboot your pc into safe mode shut down your pc wait a few seconds then turn it back on as your computer restarts but before windows launches press f use the arrow keys to highlight the safe mode with networking option which loads all of the above files and drivers and the essential services and drivers to start networking and press enter if windows launches before you can choose a safe mode restart your computer and try again now it's time to start each program you installed and run scans first open ad aware update to the latest signatures and run a full system scan delete any malware found close the program and move on to avg anti spyware again update run complete scan and delete the baddies do the same for spybot and superantispyware when you are finished restart the computer normally step clean up and protect i would recommend leaving avg and ad aware on your system and delete the other two these anti spyware programs do not conflict and offer good future protection if you happen to like the interface of the others then by all means keep the ones you want just so long as you have at least one solid stand alone on your system uninstall the others via add remove in the control panel step not done yet we've taken care of the spyware but there still may be viruses and trojans lurking on your pc if there is an anti virus program running on your pc shut it down yes you read right end the program we need to run a few online scans that may conflict with the anti virus installed go to trend micro http housecall trendmicro com to download and run their free online scanner take whatever action the scanner tells you for any virus found finally do the same with the panda online activescan http www pandasoftware com products ac restart your computer step peace at last make sure your anti virus program of choice is running again and is up to date if you do not have one i suggest avg free antivirus here http free grisoft com doc or avast home http www avast com eng download avast be sure you have at least one of the anti spyware programs running and also make sure you have a good firewall pc tools firewall plus is free and works on xp and vista http www pctools com firewall as does winpatrol http www winpatrol com download html this procedure will remove most malware however

any reason why my laptop password changed overnight it's worked away from school all summer but now suddenly it won't let me log on using my username and password on that network domain i can log on as the administrator to that network domain and also to various other accounts on my local machine only the password to my school account on the school domain isn't working i should mention that this account was logged on but locked overnight it was not in a public place where someone could physically alter the security settings i'm not connected to the school network from home so any changes that they might have done there will not affect my laptop account for instance they changed my network username when i got married earlier this summer and it didn't affect the username and password i use to log on my personal laptop at home i am one of network administrators my school sometimes does maintenence on the system and it changes my password you have to call the school and they will help you out  Password User (computing) Windows XP Password cracking E-mail Oracle database GameFAQs Surveillance Files-11 Rootkit System/34 Google Talk Novell NetWare Database 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Caulfield Grammar School Laptop Stopping e-mail abuse Cross site scripting Virtual Network Computing Windows 2000 HIPAA E-mail spam Computer security System/36 Danger Hiptop Gmail Apple Open Collaboration Environment Buffer overflow Btrieve Wi-Fi Phishing LiveJournal USB flash drive Computer insecurity Domain Name System MMORPG IBM PC compatible Computer bus Two-factor authentication Home directory Database management system Cryptography Computer Remote administration MDAC Online shop Kerberos (protocol) X display manager Internet protocol spoofing Master Control Program Bluetooth Internet Relay Chat Secure Shell Independent Media Center Wheel of Fortune Hercules emulator Netfilter/iptables Spyware Gaia Online Concurrent Versions System OpenVPN Control-Alt-Delete Malware Intrusion-detection system Atari ST Virtual private network Japanese copyright law Active Directory Game show Octopus card Dictionary attack Anonymity Jumpstart 3rd Grade Closed-circuit television Wireless LAN Aspect-oriented programming Telephone tapping File system Rlogin Internet forum Perfect Dark Cheating in Counter-Strike Slashdot Unix security Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing Key (lock) Control Panel (Windows) IBook Common Unix Printing System Windows Vista PowerPC Wardriving Hard disk Mach kernel IP Multimedia Subsystem Private branch exchange Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

dr watson debugger please only if you know i have something on my computer called dr watson debugger it slows my computer down and then crashes it its not listed as a program i do see it as a process when i control alt delete i notice several people have asked about it but every answer is differant i need someone who knows what this is to tell me if its bad and step by step how to remove it ps i have counter spy and trend micro pccillin and ad ware so i have plenty of spyware removers and a darn good anti virus so i'm sure its not spyware not sure its a virus either please let me know ok how can i remove it in microsoft windows dr watson is an application debugger included with the operating system it is usually named drwatson exe drwtsn exe or dwwin exe depending on the version of windows it is named after doctor watson of sherlock holmes fame with the idea being that it would collect error information symptoms following the problem affliction the use of the term watson has since by extension been expanded the information obtained and logged by dr watson is the information needed by technical support personnel to diagnose a program error for a computer running windows a text file drwtsn log is created whenever an error is detected and can be delivered to support personnel by the method they prefer a crash dump file can also be created which is a binary file that a programmer can load into a debugger dr watson can be made to generate more exacting information for debugging purposes if the appropriate symbol files are installed and the symbol search path environment variable is set when a program error occurs in windows the system searches for a program error handler a program error handler deals with errors as they arise during the running of a program if the system does not find a program error handler the system verifies that the program is not currently being debugged and considers the error to be unhandled the system then processes unhandled errors by looking in the registry for a program error debugger for which dr watson is the default a third party debugger can also be used in place of dr watson dr watson does not run in my windows xp home sp it is present in windows system as drwtsn and drwtsn and both are outdated i didn't remove them because they don't cause a problem you may be running an older windows operating system in which case dr watson is a problem it was a problem with windows until i removed it  AmigaOS Visual Basic Software bug Windows registry Exception handling Btrieve Windows XP Datatype MDAC Java programming language PHP Virtual memory Microsoft Windows Domain Name System Library (computer science) Buffer overflow Computer security File system Rootkit Mac OS X Unicode SAS System Objective-C Perl Magic number (programming) Forth programming language Embedded system Expert system Filename extension Malware Central processing unit Computer software Common Lisp Mach kernel Linux Common Unix Printing System Windows 3.x Linked list ALGOL 68 Compiler optimization Hash table Windows API Portable Document Format Mozilla Firefox Thread (computer science) JavaScript Component Object Model Xcode Computer Trojan horse (computing) Master Control Program Hello world program Debugger File Allocation Table CPU cache Windows Me Lisp programming language GNU Debugger IBM PC compatible ITunes Information Technology Infrastructure Library Core dump X Window System Macromedia Flash Brainfuck Mouse (computing) Integrated development environment Python programming language Linux kernel Computer file NX bit PaX GNU Anti-virus software History of Microsoft Windows Comparison of file systems HyperCard Internet Explorer System 7 (Macintosh) DragonFly BSD Aspect-oriented programming XSL Transformations AOL Instant Messenger Dynamic-Link Library Digital circuit Kazaa

computer networking research question for movie would it be possibly and if so how would it be possible to send a secured wireless signal be it through a cell phone or access points range extenders to get into an fbi local office without them knowing it some my hero can access the internet from being inside the office without them knowing it is it possible its a scene where hes talking to an fbi agent and has a friend leave a laptop for him in the restroom when he goes take a dump hes actually using accessing the internet when hes not suppose to to email the bad guys or can the fbi's own lan be hacked to a point where you can only use internet not hack their files but access maybe an email server or myspace page thats what im trying to see if possible to only have access to the internet from inside an fbi regional office without them knowing it any help appreciated i wonder if the fbi is now watching me forposting this question its for movie research only fbi's security is overrated i saw video of some guys actually entering and fbi office's lan getting an internet connection from a lan that has one should be just as easy nowadays it would take time though a bit longer than the time it takes a normal person to take a dump i think its a lame idea though to leave a laptop in a restroom i mean wouldn't it be easier to just leave a cellphone in there so he could call or text the bad guys a cellphone is much more concealable and efficient than having to boot up a laptop and use a noisy keyboard and having to log on to website and do all that trouble with wireless lan's and stuff heck they could even leave a waterproof cell in the tank  Bluetooth Internet Wi-Fi Mobile phone Wireless LAN E-mail IBM PC compatible Surveillance Plame affair Local area network Computer virus Pretty Good Privacy Novell NetWare Computer E-mail spam Modem Windows 2000 The Inside Telephone Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Universal Serial Bus Broadband Internet access Internet fraud Data retention BlackBerry Proxy server Intranet Gmail National Weather Service Timeline of hacker history Virtual Network Computing File system PlayStation Portable Morse Code Multiplayer Wireless network MP3 Homestar Runner Voice over IP Global Positioning System Ethernet Phishing Hacker (computer security) Denial-of-service attack Laptop Common Unix Printing System Cellular network AirPort Mach kernel Mouse (computing) Whois Desktop computer AmigaOS Telephone numbering plan Skype Opera (web browser) Cisco Systems Spam (electronic) Global System for Mobile Communications Apple Macintosh IP address Computer forensics USB flash drive History of Microsoft Windows Game programmer Web crawler Computer security Transmission Control Protocol MSN Messenger Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Karl Rove MAME Simple Mail Transfer Protocol BitTorrent Anonymous remailer Cross site scripting File Transfer Protocol Contemporary culture of South Korea Wireless access point MDAC Microwave Federal Standard 1037C Windows Server 2003 2001 anthrax attacks 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines GSM services Hard disk Steganography GameFAQs

squad but hjt logs really aren't hard to read as far as the file paths being shortend by y answers javascript implementation after viewing a whole bunch of these logs the shortened files paths are actually quite refreshing if you need additional info you can always mouse over the shortend file path for a couple of seconds to read the full thing the only real issue i see there other than a crap load of toolbars that would personally drive me nuts is the fact that you are running both avg antivirus and symantec norton security center at the same time runing multiple av solutions that both provide real time monitoring can lead to poor performance false positives endless loops and general system instability if your subscription is current with norton i would remove the avg if you want a backup av scanner i would use an online service such as trend micro housecall or bitdefender free http www snapfiles com reviews bitdefender free edition bdfree html as it does not monitor in real time on demand only scanning another object of concern is the juan dll associated with one of your noname bho's no name browser helper objects should always send up a red flag this is part of a generic zlob trojan although the location points to a missing file in the temp directory this combined with the fact that spybot s d is scheduled to run agin at next boot sounds like this is a recently removed infection more than likely the scheduled run of spybot s d will remove any files that were in use and currently undeletable after next reboot i would run hjt again and pay close attention to references to juan dll if necessary you may need to disable system restore thereby removing all past restoration points in order to fully clean the infection i would strongly recommend an online trend micro scan after next reboot http housecall trendmicro com

my email has been hacked what do i do ive had this account for years msnlive is at the root im gets you hac i have been hacked through msnlive and now it's attached to my email and i would like to know how to report and have them removed i have also begun to get spam every day even though i have all my spamcontrol activated there is alot of reasons why this could have happened really the best thing for you to do is a virus scan or just reformat if you want to make totally sure to get rid of any type of trojans or keyloggers that are placed on your system i recommend avast it's a free anti virus scanner and very good don't install more then one anti virus on your computer at a time you should also keep your windows updated with the latest security patches i think your system is total compromised and should just be formatted but many will argue with me about this because they believe a simple spyware or virus scan will deal with it i doubt it since many trojans can be made and never enter in the av's database thus they are never detected you should try to log in your e mail account and change your password this will probably be some where in the e mail options you should only do this if your sure your system isn't compromised with trojans or some kind of keylogger or else it want matter if you change your password  Computer virus Trojan horse (computing) Rootkit Windows XP Stopping e-mail abuse E-mail spam RuneScape cheats E-mail Steam (content delivery) Phishing Anti-virus software Gmail Password Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Password cracking Computer security Computer forensics GameFAQs Hacker (computer security) Surveillance Timeline of hacker history AOL Instant Messenger Sender Policy Framework Computer insecurity Virtual Network Computing Proxy server Cross site scripting 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines OpenBSD Microsoft Windows Outlook Express Trusted computing Spybot - Search & Destroy Internet fraud Anonymous remailer Danger Hiptop Comparison of web browsers Denial-of-service attack Cheating in Counter-Strike Windows 2000 Neopets Mydoom Control Panel (Windows) MapleStory Pretty Good Privacy Intrusion-detection system Email authentication Electronic voting Blue screen of death File system Domain Name System Viral marketing Mozilla Application Suite Common criticisms of Microsoft Buffer overflow Screensaver Ebook Virus Patch (computing) Port scanner Computer surveillance Opera (web browser) Cybercrime PunkBuster IPod Botnet Common Unix Printing System Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Internet security Advance fee fraud Partition (computing) Emacs ILOVEYOU Data retention Adware Captcha Enterprise content management Digital rights management Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Database management system Next-Generation Secure Computing Base Microsoft Btrieve Theory of conduct Plame affair Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Apple Open Collaboration Environment System/36 MDAC

aim chatroom security i was recently in an aim chatroom just for the heck of it figured i'd see what was up well there was a guy in the chatroom whom apparently had some program downloaded to his computer and was able to control who was kicked out of the room and banned and who was immune to the codes so the first few letters of your sn would be involved to ban you and it'd look like sh ban and you'd get kicked out of the room for a few seconds and would have to wait to go back in well i have a short temper and imed the guy who was doing it and kicking me and i said something a tad bit mean and blocked him i'm worried though that maybe he had access to my ip with programs like that because it was through aol instant messenger can someone help please i was also wondering if anyone could tell me what the name of the program he was using is called too thank you sooo much i'm pretty worried about this yeah i remember back in the day me and a friend would kick and flood everyone out of the msn gaming zone i believe it's shut down now yes age of empires the best game ever anyways this dude who is doing it probably isn't skilled enough to do any real attacks if he got your ip address matter of fact i doubt he did since most of those chating programs are server side in the first place there would need to be some kind of connection straight from his computer to yours and not through like a proxy server i bet he is just using some other dudes program and doing it taking the credit for it i doubt he was able to reverse engineer or find the exploit himself i don't really do this junk anymore but these programs are actually called hacks cracks flooders booters etc a quick google search with using the hack program zip msn would probably find you some be careful though these things are usually loaded with trojans even if you have anti virus it may not have that trojan in it's database  AOL Instant Messenger America Online MSN Messenger Cheating in Counter-Strike E-mail spam Microsoft Computer virus Spyware Instant messaging Spam (electronic) Steam (content delivery) GameFAQs Domain Name System Phishing Windows XP Timeline of hacker history Internet Relay Chat RuneScape cheats Computer security Gmail Hacker (computer security) Trojan horse (computing) Malware 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Google Password Chat room GunZ The Duel Hacker Firewall (networking) CPU cache Mach kernel Password cracking MAME File sharing Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs The Star Wars Holiday Special Port numbers Danger Hiptop Stopping e-mail abuse Web traffic Microsoft Windows Proxy server Denial-of-service attack Anonymous remailer Kim Possible Goatse.cx Computer insecurity E-mail Internet censorship in mainland China Web crawler Rootkit Internet fraud Quake III Arena Kyle Broflovski BZFlag Jumpstart 3rd Grade Skype Mac OS X RISC MMORPG Opera (web browser) ICQ Ragnarok Online Embedded system Volleyball Jabber Internet The Fairly OddParents StarCraft Secret Missions OpenDocument X Window System Internet Explorer Utopia (online game) Totally Spies!

how do i set that security tag thing i had seen an ad on yahoo a couple months ago about a tag that you could put on the page that you log into this tag gave you the option to use either a picture or a saying with it i guess it was supposed to be a secure thing so that you could log into another computer without having to worryabout people logging into your account okay so i do not fully know what it is for but i want one does anyone even know what i am talking about they had the ad for it beside the login box a while back now i can not seem to find a link to do it any idea it is for you to put a personal pic or password that only you will recognize and then when you login to your yahoo account you will know it is safe if the pic you put there isn't shown then you are on a phissing site and not legit yahoo it doesn't stop another from logining into your account but if you use strong security then they cant any way hope this helps clear up your question  Password 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Database management system Theory of conduct User (computing) GameFAQs Patricia Ford Neopets Internet fraud HTTP cookie RuneScape cheats Cross site scripting Steam (content delivery) The Inside Open Directory Project Two-factor authentication Danger Hiptop Surveillance Dictionary attack Wheel of Fortune Windows XP OpenBSD CPU cache Phishing Rootkit Passphrase Google Talk Coming of Age (TNG episode) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act MSN Messenger Online shop Shibboleth GameFAQs message boards E-mail spam Gmail RSTS/E Jumpstart 3rd Grade Non-native pronunciations of English Jeff Gannon E-mail Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Common Unix Printing System Ecco the Dolphin Classified information Spyware Cryptographic hash function Secret sharing PIC microcontroller System/34 System/36 Double the Fist Telnet Halting problem Stopping e-mail abuse Debugging Bad Wolf Password (game) Files-11 Search engine optimization HTML element Control-Alt-Delete Professional wrestling slang The nature of God in Western theology Plame affair Karen Horney 11001001 (TNG episode) Hacker (computer game) Social rule Intrusion-detection system The Battle (TNG episode) Database Rlogin Philosophy of space and time Kasparov versus The World PHP One-time pad The Doctor Dances Google File Transfer Protocol Data retention Slashdot H2G2 Sport The Star Wars Holiday Special Google search Survivor (novel) Alcoholics Anonymous Computer security MapleStory Windows 2000 Utopia (online game) Prolog Amiga Power Identity document Everything2 Authentication Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Baroque chess World War Three (Doctor Who)

ipsec and ssl question for ipsec and ssl the nodes running the protocol are assumed to be secure which additional security mechanisms do you need at these nodes to make this assumption true you have two major concerns to worry about the remote system is not owned by an unauthorized user and you implicitly trust the remote system user to not do anything stupid there are many things that are incorporated into concern to include them being malware free properly patched firewalled correctly and that they fail secure there are others but just these four will cause the most headaches as they also have subcategories to them malware free means no viruses trojans rootkits spyware keyloggers etc patching includes every single piece of software and hardware drivers being exploit free with heavy concentration on remote exploit free you can do this by including network access control nac into your solutions to ensure that anti virus definitions are up to date and that the trusted av software is running on the system firewalls are running on the hosts etc your biggest problem here is that nac is relatively new and vendors are just starting to catch up to nac enable their products the second concern deals with the authorized users at the other end this could be users within your corporation may be partners public access or a combination of these you have the most control of corporate users as you can provide them with the proper software training hardware etc to get them up and running and ensure that they don't have means to circumvent your configurations partners and non corporate users are hard to ensure that they are doing things properly and in cases where you connect your infrastructures together such as a corporate merger or partnership you have to not only trust the people but also their network in these cases you don't have control of what bad stuff that happens on their network yet you have to have some assurance they their bad stuff doesn't propagate to your network this is where a cio should be advising the ceo as to the risks involved with the connection and should be doing whatever he she can to limit the exposure they may choose to do a nac solution or require that systems be provided to the partner that are authenticated by the local system prior to being allowed to access it an example of a problem you might experience with an encrypted tunnel would be allowing the user to connect to both the internet and the tunnel at the same time while the user is browsing the internet and connected to your network an intelligent hacker could get into the users system and propagate the tunnel to get to protected network resources the prevention of this type of attack is to setup a closed vpn which allows the user to only be connected to the vpn or be disconnected from it so if they were to browse the internet while connected to the vpn they'd have to use the internet connection from the corporation through all of the proxies firewalls etc as they would from the home office this at least puts more restrictions and control over that remote user while they're outside the office wg  Bluetooth MDAC Internet Secure Shell Proxy server IPsec USB flash drive Data retention Fritz-chip Windows Server 2003 Linux Steam (content delivery) E-mail spam Microsoft Skype Windows Vista Microsoft Windows Buffer overflow Ethernet Voice over IP IP Multimedia Subsystem Internet Relay Chat Kazaa Network address translation Freenet 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Copy protection Public-key cryptography History of Microsoft Windows Redundant array of independent disks IBM PC compatible Cryptography Common criticisms of Microsoft File Transfer Protocol Computer surveillance PlayStation 2 Cheating in Counter-Strike E-mail Wget Trojan horse (computing) Computer Modem Enterprise content management Floppy disk Denial-of-service attack Internet privacy IPv6 Grid computing Public key infrastructure Appliance Transmission Control Protocol Information Technology Infrastructure Library Global Positioning System Domain Name System FreeBSD Stopping e-mail abuse Personal firewall Intrusion-detection system Cisco Systems Free software Novell NetWare Surveillance Hard disk Common Unix Printing System Wardriving Extensible Authentication Protocol Internet censorship in mainland China Anti-virus software Phreaking Sender Policy Framework Modchip Phishing Architecture of Windows 2000 File system

buffer overrun attacks on the call stack some buffer overrun attacks put the code they want to be executed on the call stack how can the ability to distinguish between programs and data help to construct a defense against this particular type of buffer overrun attacks the idea is as follows your processor has memories a data memory and a program memory the os can read write to both types of memory but only starts programs running in the program memory programs can only read write to data memory leaving program memory pristine an attempt to execute an instruction in data memory is considered an exemption causing the os to take over and terminate the program that tried to execute data buffer overruns can only modify data memory and thus can't cause new code to be executed what can still happen is that a different code path could be taken for instance if i knew that address x was the address of the bitch slap the user subroutine then i could change the stack with a buffer overrun to cause this subroutine to be run  Buffer overflow Forth programming language Subroutine Stack-smashing protection CPU cache Pointer Motorola 68000 CDC 6600 CPU design Variable Virtual memory C programming language Threaded code Apollo Guidance Computer Thread (computer science) RISC PDP-8 MDAC Von Neumann architecture Perl Emacs NX bit Microprogram X86 assembly language Computer Burroughs B5000 BASIC programming language Visual Basic IA-32 MOS Technology 6502 Self-modifying code MUMPS PostScript X86 Embedded system Page table Assembly language Computer virus Processor register Compiler Mach kernel System/34 IBM 1401 Object-oriented programming PDP-11 Register renaming Software bug Architecture of Windows 2000 Multics DragonFly BSD Master Control Program Return-to-libc attack Perl 6 Emulator Windows 2000 IBM 1130 Control flow Stack (computing) Sinclair ZX81 MBASIC RCA 1802 Addressing mode Data General Nova Booting Resource fork C plus plus Spring operating system Datatype HP BASIC for OpenVMS Windows XP Crash (computing) Library (computer science) Linked list Programming language Pipeline (Unix) Cache Java programming language Lisp programming language MMIX AMD 29000 General protection fault Cray-1 LR parser Out-of-order execution P-Code machine Malloc CDC Cyber Method (computer science) Trusted computing English Electric KDF9 IBM 1620 Computer multitasking

can someone please explain unified authentication to me in easy to understand terms i am not a computer expert nor do i know all the jargon associated with computer security but i need to know what unified authentication is every website i find about it speaks way over my head think of it this way it's like going to a guardhouse showing your id and getting a key that opens every house in the neighborhood it means that you enter your id and password once and this lets you login to other software programs web sites whatever without having to enter your id and password again a good example is microsoft passport any web site that accepts a passport will not ask for your password once you've logged into your passport for offices activedirectory and ldap are common examples  Password Password cracking Two-factor authentication Windows XP Stopping e-mail abuse Uniform Resource Locator Cross site scripting Secure Shell User (computing) Cryptography Telnet Authentication MSN Messenger Phishing Windows 2000 Spyware Malware Database management system File Transfer Protocol Public key infrastructure Proxy server Passport Passphrase Novell NetWare OpenSSH Trusted computing Kerberos (protocol) Database Microsoft Extensible Authentication Protocol Lightweight Directory Access Protocol Control-Alt-Delete Website Computer security Digital rights management Backdoor Microsoft .NET Internet Single sign-on Rlogin Wi-Fi Protected Access Computer insecurity Apache HTTP Server RuneScape cheats Common Unix Printing System HTTP cookie Computer forensics Buffer overflow Web design S/KEY Use case Perl Software bug E-mail spam Shibboleth Software engineering Slashdot Dictionary attack Web service Public-key cryptography 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Java programming language Rootkit Trojan horse (computing) Wi-Fi Hacker Skype Hotmail PHP Online shop Windows Server 2003 Cryptographic hash function Internet slang Computer virus IEEE 802.11i Pretty Good Privacy Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing System/36 Password-authenticated key agreement Debugging Enterprise content management Internet Message Access Protocol Surveillance Server Independent Media Center GameFAQs Internet forum RFID Internet fraud Ontology (computer science) Web server SHA hash functions MDAC Object-oriented programming Free software British national identity card Challenge-response authentication Software agent Open Directory Project

what are the technical components of a good security policy for companies who use broadband services the main issue with the internet and broadband services in particular is that you are sharing components with others to reduce the overall cost to you this sharing leaves you open to being spied upon by other organizations that have nothing to do with supplying you this connection service thus the major component of using such services is making such spying useless encryption of all information on such shared services is the basis for making the spying useless probably vpn tunneling is the most common method for encrypting network traffic it is a very good method relying upon shared keys that you can provide you can also use dongles or other devices to have a better key control policy  Virtual private network Internet Windows 2000 Password Public-key cryptography Broadband Internet access Voice over IP Cable television USB flash drive NSA encryption systems Bluetooth Computer security Secure Shell Skype Pretty Good Privacy Computer Data retention Windows XP Surveillance Wireless LAN Digital Subscriber Line Internet censorship in mainland China Broadband Export of cryptography Copy protection Transport Layer Security BT Group plc WiMAX BlackBerry Digital rights management Asynchronous Transfer Mode Global System for Mobile Communications IPsec Teletraffic Engineering in Broadband Networks Satellite internet Internet service provider Router Data center MDAC Computer insecurity Denial-of-service attack Customer relationship management Streaming media Juniper Networks Active Directory Corporate governance Internet Relay Chat Kerberos (protocol) IP Multimedia Subsystem Microsoft .NET Network address translation Telephone tapping Telewest Broadband Intranet Digital divide EKMS HIPAA Encryption Next-Generation Secure Computing Base Dongle Broadband Networks Enterprise content management Digital television Electronic commerce Virtual Network Computing Eircom Wardriving X Window System Password cracking Pirate decryption Trusted computing OpenVPN Firewall (networking) Traffic contract AT&T Cable modem Ethernet Apple Open Collaboration Environment Crypto-anarchism RFID Extensible Authentication Protocol Telephone Grid computing National Security Agency Modem E-mail Sky Digital PlayStation 2 Power line communication Server Message Block Freenet Cryptanalysis of the Enigma Cryptanalysis Point-to-point tunneling protocol Microsoft Windows Web service Universal Mobile Telecommunications System

do macs have virus protection built in my friend said that when she was buying her macbook she asked about virus protection and they said it was built in with no subscription or software is that true seeing as how none of the people answering so far know i'll tell you no there is no antivirus software built in the reason is that the mac has a small userbase compared to windows machines so it's not a very good target for attack as it'd affect very few people however the mac os blocks the most common paths viruses use to enter your machine and apple issues bugfixes frequently when a vulnerability is found so macs are pretty safe in that regard same with linux just don't let them lie about antivirus protection macs are protected against common attacks but if there were to be a real virus there's nothing to stop them plain and simple  Computer virus Anti-virus software Microsoft Windows Software bug Filename extension Skype Mac OS X Operating system Computer security Spyware Rootkit USB flash drive Mac OS 9 Mydoom Windows XP Mach kernel Windows Vista Microsoft Word AOL Instant Messenger Apple Macintosh Copyleft X Window System Peer-to-peer Internet security Norton AntiVirus Thread (computer science) Copy protection Unicode Mozilla Firefox Blue screen of death Floppy disk Pretty Good Privacy Linux Internet Relay Chat Trusted computing History of the graphical user interface History of Microsoft Windows HyperCard Microsoft Office IPod Windows 2000 Perl E-mail spam Opera (web browser) NX bit Linux kernel Kazaa Common Lisp 64-bit MMORPG Buffer overflow Steam (content delivery) NeXT Wine (software) Timeline of computing 1990-forward Malware Digital rights management One-time pad Library (computer science) Computer surveillance World of Warcraft Microsoft Spam (electronic) MSN Messenger Common criticisms of Microsoft Uplink (computer game) Text editor Apple Intel transition ITunes Java programming language Lisp programming language Zone Labs Common Unix Printing System Commodore 64 Amiga Linux distribution Naval mine Platform (computing) Trojan horse (computing) PHP GNU General Public License Microprocessor Denial-of-service attack Vorbis Emulator IBM PC compatible Mac OS X v10.0 System 7 (Macintosh) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kernel (computer science) ITunes Music Store Session Initiation Protocol Darwin (operating system) Booting Mac OS X v10.3 Censorware

how do i report a person who is sending me mail about a persons will i recently recieved an email from a person who is says that he is a bank accountant and says that a person died and has left me some money because i share some sort of distance relationship as him he said that we share the same last name what struck me the most suspicious was that he never told me the persons name and whats more suspicous is that his mail was a yahoo account but my reply was to a gmail account im planning on seeing if he will give me the name plus the persons race because my display name is different from my real name and my real name is of a different origin even though i am of a completely different race and when he starts to dip out i have to report it some questions i was wondering is when you die does your money go to the next of kin if i do report it how do i know that i got a response i forgot one critcal question how do i report this to gmail and i think this is from the uk not nigeria mainly because of a supicious email that i found on the details which i used to find a girl from the uk on myspace please do not get suckered into this it is most definitely a scam if this was true then they would contant you through the mail usually certified to answer your questions usually if you die without a will to indicate your wishes the court steps in and distributes your property according to the laws of your state you might want to check out the laws that are in place in your state usually it will go to the spouse and if they are deceased to the children and so on if no heirs are found then the properties money homes land and so forth will be taken by the state you probably won't get a response there are millions of scams out there that are being reported responding to each individual scam would be too time consuming the best answer i can give you is to just take it as it is you did your part and hopefully they will do theirs sorry lol i just realized you needed a website woopsies here's one that you can look into but you can google it too look under consumer fraud reporting  Advance fee fraud Gmail Internet fraud Google Stopping e-mail abuse Confidence trick Phishing Hotmail RuneScape cheats Plame affair Concurrent estate Bank fraud Webmail Opera (web browser) Neopets Spam (electronic) Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act United States Postal Service Mail-order bride Domain Name System SCO-Linux controversies E-mail spam One Tree Hill (TV series) Make money fast 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tax Email authentication Avenue Q Taxation in the United States Trust (Law) USA Mail fraud Internet troll Fraud Expert system Schabir Shaik Trial Divorce Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Administration Charles Ponzi Social Security (United States) Notary public Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Domestic violence Child support Polygamy Grief Credit card fraud Direct marketing Google Talk National Kidney Foundation Singapore Neighbours Civil unions in the United Kingdom MSN Messenger Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

is anyone good with getting rid of viruses my computer is infected with virtumonde which constantly creates new problems and pop ups on the internet which slow my computer i've tried spybot adaware windows live onecare scanner and more they get rid of some of the problems virtumonde creates but either they don't find all of the sources or they can't fix all of them the live onecare scanner showed that there were viruses it couldn't fix and showed the locations i maually deleted of those files myself the last virtumode virus it couldn't fix spybot didn't even find some of those virsus adaware automatically shuts down halfway through the scan process it was located in c windows system htuieml dll it won't let me delete that file though because it's being used currently i closed all programs but it still wouldn't let me delete it cleary this is a tough virus to get rid of i can't figure out how to put my windows xp computer into safe mode so i can delete it i'm pretty good with computers too please help long answer good solution used with permission from numbersix printing this would be helpful you need not follow this in exact order or even do all the steps but it was written this way to ensure all issues where handled if you find one portion particularly helpful for removing a problem please email me step don't panic take a deep breath and go grab a cup of your favorite beverage this may take awhile step clean up your pc remove programs you don't use via the add remove programs in the control panel in vista you remove programs by clicking programs and features in the control panel if you are unsure of a particular program you can check it against a list of offenders here http forums majorgeeks com showthread php t clean your hard drive of unnecessary files using ccleaner here http www ccleaner com download save to your desktop install it then run the cleaner simple yet it will free up tons of space on your hard drive while you have the program open run the registry checker as well this will fix invalid registry entries safely note that you should run ccleaner for all accounts on your pc step create a new system restore point click start all programs accessories system tools system restore create a restore point now delete all but this most recent restore point click start all programs accessories system tools disk cleanup click more options tab and then under system restore click clean up click yes to remove all but the most recent restore point click ok click yes and then click ok step now let's start to get rid of those nasties download the following programs to your desktop you should then install each one but don't run them yet patience patience lavasoft's ad aware from here http www lavasoftusa com products ad a avg anti spyware from here http www ewido net en download spybot search and destroy from here http www safer networking org en downl superantispyware from here http www superantispyware com i know this seems like overkill but until someone can come up with one program that can detect everything in the wild we need to use programs from several reputable sources step use them safely once these programs are installed on your pc their effectiveness may be negated by running scans normally you need to reboot your pc into safe mode shut down your pc wait a few seconds then turn it back on as your computer restarts but before windows launches press f use the arrow keys to highlight the safe mode with networking option which loads all of the above files and drivers and the essential services and drivers to start networking and press enter if windows launches before you can choose a safe mode restart your computer and try again now it's time to start each program you installed and run scans first open ad aware update to the latest signatures and run a full system scan delete any malware found close the program and move on to avg anti spyware again update run complete scan and delete the baddies do the same for spybot and superantispyware when you are finished restart the computer normally step clean up and protect i would recommend leaving avg and ad aware on your system and delete the other two these anti spyware programs do not conflict and offer good future protection if you happen to like the interface of the others then by all means keep the ones you want just so long as you have at least one solid stand alone on your system uninstall the others via add remove in the control panel step not done yet we've taken care of the spyware but there still may be viruses and trojans lurking on your pc if there is an anti virus program running on your pc shut it down yes you read right end the program we need to run a few online scans that may conflict with the anti virus installed go to trend micro http housecall trendmicro com to download and run their free online scanner take whatever action the scanner tells you for any virus found finally do the same with the panda online activescan http www pandasoftware com products ac restart your computer step peace at last make sure your anti virus program of choice is running again and is up to date if you do not have one i suggest avg free antivirus here http free grisoft com doc or avast home http www avast com eng download avast be sure you have at least one of the anti spyware programs running and also make sure you have a good firewall pc tools firewall plus is free and works on xp and vista http www pctools com firewall as does winpatrol http www winpatrol com download html this procedure will remove most malware however it may not catch some really nasty buggers if you've followed all the steps and still believe you have something not right on your pc you need some extra help go here http www tomcoyote org hijackthis to download a program called hijackthis it examines certain key areas of the registry and hard drive and lists their contents install run and save a logfile which you may post on one of the forums listed on that same page as above some kind soul will then come along and examine your logfile and give you recommendations in order to wipe any remaining buggers away please

what security do i need with my new macbook with my dell windows xp i use spybot adaware microsoft defender and avg antivirus my plan is to buy a macbook very soon what anti virus and other security items should i get for my macbook i'm getting the macbook instead of another pc because i'm tired of dealing with so many freaking problems thanks for any suggestions you may have the wonderful thing about os x is that you really don't need to bother too much with security even without any security programs you will be just fine with what os x has built in if you really want to you can download clamxav link in sources which is an anti virus program however with nothing but proof of concept attacks and no real viruses out there there's no use for this program if you want to be secure just do the following turn on your firewall system preferences sharing firewall tab press the start button to turn it on in the same area that you turned on your firewall click the advanced button bottom right place a check next to all three boxes block udp traffic firewall logging and stealth mode note if you experience problems with bittorrent uncheck the block udp traffic box chances are though you won't experience any issues keep bluetooth secure go to system preferences bluetooth sharing tab you will see a list to the left with a column with a key icon at the top place a check under every box in this column this makes sure that authentication is required for any bluetooth device to connect to your mac after doing steps you will have an incredibly secure system if you're really paranoid you can also go to system preferences security and set a master password for your mac and turn on filevault this encrypts everything in your home folder note that this will cause a decrease in performance and it truly isn't that necessary also if you want to shell out some cash you can buy a program called little snitch this program alerts you if any program attempts to call home which actually can be pretty useful link in sources best of luck on your switch  Anti-virus software Computer virus Mac OS X Skype Bluetooth Mouse (computing) Windows Vista Computer security Windows 2000 Mozilla Firefox Firewall (networking) Rootkit MDAC Cheating in Counter-Strike Linux Cryptography Password Public-key cryptography Netfilter/iptables Malware Screenshot Peer-to-peer Object Desktop 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Mach kernel Secure Shell Stopping e-mail abuse History of the graphical user interface Computer insecurity Pretty Good Privacy System/36 Internet security Java programming language System/34 Python programming language AmigaOS Buffer overflow File Transfer Protocol Surveillance Spam (electronic) MapleStory Internet Relay Chat USB flash drive OpenBSD History of Microsoft Windows IBM PC compatible HyperCard Server Message Block Thread (computer science) Macintosh Finder Steam (content delivery) BitTorrent OS/2 EMule HTTP cookie Danger Hiptop Gmail IPsec Tungsten Handheld AOL Instant Messenger Blue screen of death Gnutella X Window System Minesweeper (computer game) File system Windows Server 2003 Toyota Prius Intrusion-detection system Streaming media Ethernet PHP Federal Standard 1037C Computer and video games Computer surveillance One-time pad Domain Name System Wi-Fi IPod Wget C programming language Google Talk Virtual memory Windows registry Macromedia Flash Filename extension

how to add ip addresses to norton antivirus for blocking contact from i have been receiving somewhat unwelcome intrusions on my norton antivirus software rarely do i not see the norton notification window open and informing me that it has stopped yet another attempt to infiltrate my computer by unwanted hackers i read in the norton help that you can add ip addresses to the block list so that you do not receive communication with from them i was wondering how do i go about initiating entering numerous ip addresses to this list so that i can get some uninterrupted computer use without being at risk from hacking i have looked around on the norton antivirus user interface and can't see anything i see a window that exists for adding such a list but cannot add any ips as the buttons are disabled i don't think you can add ip addresses to norton antivirus nav looks at files already on your computer not ip addresses firewalls look at ip addresses if you mean you're getting notifications from norton firewall or norton internet security adding an ip address to the block list won't do anything the notification is itself indication that the firewall did its job now if you do mean nis or norton firewall poke around in it and look for a way to reduce the notification frequency that won't affect the operation just the interruptions  Stopping e-mail abuse Anti-virus software Computer security Gmail Windows XP Skype Spyware Firewall (networking) Netfilter/iptables Windows 2000 Domain Name System Spam (electronic) Internet security Computer insecurity Buffer overflow Filename extension OS/2 Windows Vista Windows Server 2003 Phishing Computer virus Voice over IP Dialer Wi-Fi Blue screen of death Personal firewall Universal Plug and Play Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Hacker Web service NX bit Linux Embedded system OpenBSD Symantec MS-DOS Mozilla Firefox Perl Emacs USB flash drive Apollo Guidance Computer Microsoft E-mail spam Norton AntiVirus Proxy server Computer Mydoom Atari 8-bit family Opera (web browser) Malware Intrusion-detection system X Window System GameFAQs Mozilla Application Suite File Transfer Protocol Common Unix Printing System Intel iAPX 432 Thread (computer science) Password Morse Code Pretty Good Privacy Commodore 64 Peer-to-peer Apple Computer Zone Labs Macromedia Flash Palm OS Unicode OS-tan FreeBSD Mandriva Linux British national identity card ZX Spectrum Internet censorship in mainland China Hard disk C programming language CPU cache AOL Instant Messenger ITunes Bluetooth FidoNet Secure Shell Floppy disk Intranet Copy protection Cheating in Counter-Strike AmigaOS Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Burroughs B5000 File system

browser launches with mouse movement read info please this problem started when i switched from mcaffee to norton internet security virus detection may or may not be related to this change the browser i use firefox but it happens to whatever the default browser is launches with every mouse movement a new window which means very quickly i can have browser windows opened and it is darn difficult to do anything else on the computer i have a laptop and this does not happen when using the touchpad only when using an attached mouse or my graphics tablet this is a problem though as i like to dock my laptop i have run numerous spyware registry checkers anti virus done research online and everything i can think of including a complete reformat which did not solve the problem any experienced suggestions greatly appreciated i believe i know your problem and it's actually a very simple one both ie and firefox will open a new tab if the center button on your mouse is clicked like right click and then selecting 'open in new tab' if your wheel button is stuck guess what a million tabs will have opened and since your touch pad doesn't have this center wheel it won't have the problem to correct it try pressing the center wheel a couple of time and see if that clears it that's what i have to do if a shift or control key gets stuck that way if that still fails to work switch to a different mouse and that should solve it  Windows XP Opera (web browser) Comparison of web browsers Spyware Macromedia Flash Screenshot Microsoft Windows IPod AmigaOS Gmail Mozilla Application Suite Computer virus Internet Explorer Object Desktop Game controller Tab (GUI) Laptop Web browser HTTP cookie USB flash drive IBM PC compatible Windows 2000 X Window System Touchpad Stopping e-mail abuse Mouse gesture Option key Browser wars Malware Sega Dreamcast Apple Macintosh Ebook Microsoft Trusted computing Pop-up ad Emacs Unicode Visual Basic Netscape Browser Minesweeper (computer game) Tabbed document interface Spread Firefox Apple Computer Rootkit Password History of the graphical user interface Trojan horse (computing) Cascading Style Sheets Blue screen of death Avant Browser Manual transmission Stardock Domain Name System Computer security Computer and video game genres Mac OS X v10.4 NPAPI Floppy disk Double-click (computing) Anti-virus software Bluetooth Mandriva Linux AOL Instant Messenger E-mail E-mail spam Konqueror Palm OS PlayStation 2 Knoppix Screensaver Ajax (programming) XML History of Microsoft Windows Control Panel (Windows) MSN Messenger PlayStation Portable Pinball MDAC Cheating in Counter-Strike Hello world program Expos__ (Mac OS X) HyperCard Component Object Model Internationalized domain name International Phonetic Alphabet Internet security Macintosh Finder Phishing Kazaa MMORPG Netscape Communications Corporation Favicon Digital rights management Timeline of computing 1990-forward

sql injection prevention what defense should i use so soon i will have logins asp sql server etc on my servers my question i guess is what would your opinion be on the type of defense i should take on this i understand each different approach but i'm curious as to what i should use let's say for instance external filtering if i get a filter what would be a good recomendation sanctum appshield but then i have to worry about certain innovative injections not being caught by the application i choose correcting the coding flaws won't always work suggestions and opinions on sql injections and other web application security is suggested kinda just wanting to discuss this matter because it's the main source of attacks firewalls aren't blocking access to my website preventing sql injection the various techniques used to prevent sql injections are parameterized query stored procedure regular expression to discard input string quoteblock function don t show detailed error messages to the user have a less privileged user role of your application in database sql injections can be prevented however there are myths about them like if i am using stored procedure i am safe one rule still follows don't show detailed error messages to the user the basic mantra to prevent sql injections is to let the string input as a string input to the sql server this can be done by checking the string terminator character before giving the input to the server some techniques like using parameterized query and using stored procedures will do it free for you however i would still suggest you to use the quoteblock function inside them ms sql server the other prevention will be only carefully deciding the grant of the execute command to the service account which you are using to make the communication possible between the sql server and the web server one handy tip is not to use dynamic sql in your application dynamic sql is like ms sql hope this will help  Cross site scripting Perl Java Database Connectivity Buffer overflow SQL injection C Sharp SQL Database Computer security Database management system Microsoft Jet Database Engine MUMPS Firewall (networking) Microsoft Access Password PostgreSQL Microsoft .NET C programming language MySQL Architecture of Windows 2000 Windows Server 2003 Windows XP Stopping e-mail abuse Expert system Oracle database Internet Relay Chat JavaScript HTTP cookie Gmail Domain Name System C plus plus Java programming language XML WebObjects E-mail spam Software testing Object-oriented programming Enterprise content management ALGOL 68 Microsoft SQL Server Windows 2000 PaX Global Positioning System Btrieve Netfilter/iptables Common Unix Printing System Windows Vista Steam (content delivery) Pretty Good Privacy Master Control Program Visual Basic Oracle Corporation Compiler optimization Spring operating system Debugging Open Database Connectivity Tcl OpenBSD Informix Public-key cryptography Google search Datatype Linux Web application Federal Standard 1037C String (computer science) Mozilla Firefox Open Directory Project Mozilla Application Suite Computer virus IP Multimedia Subsystem RuneScape cheats JavaServer Pages Unified Modeling Language ASP.NET Forth programming language Logo programming language ADO JADE programming language Uniform Resource Locator Pointer OpenOffice.org Password cracking Thread (computer science) Whois System/36

here's an easy cryptography question assume a cryptographic algorithm in which the performance for the good guys the ones that know the key grows linearly with the length of the key and for which the only way to break it is a brute force attack of trying all possible keys suppose the performance for the good guys is adequate e g it can encrypt and decrypt as fast as the bits can be transmitted over the wire at a certain size key then suppose advances in computer technology make computers twice as fast given that both the good guys and the bad guys get faster computers does this advance in computer speed work to the advantage of the good guys the bad guys or does it not make any difference it works in advantage of bad guys if you know history key length started with bit to bit to and now which today is considered reasonable secure this size increase because computing power to crack keys needed by bad guys has increased so if you keep key size fixed becuase it is adequate for good guys bad guys has increased changes of cracking it with increase in their computing power  Cryptanalysis Key size Data Encryption Standard Cryptography Brute force attack Public-key cryptography Password cracking Key (cryptography) Pretty Good Privacy RSA Advanced Encryption Standard Password One-time pad Symmetric key algorithm RISC Quantum computer Encryption Block cipher History of cryptography Enigma machine Elliptic curve cryptography Computer virus Cryptographic hash function Block cipher modes of operation 40-bit encryption XSL attack Stream cipher Hash table Topics in cryptography Snake oil (cryptography) Hardware random number generator Hash function MD5 Quicksort Cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator Ultra Modem Windows XP Computer chess Initialization vector Rotor machine Wired Equivalent Privacy Code (cryptography) RC4 Quantum cryptography Blowfish (cipher) Computer security Caesar cipher EFF DES cracker Substitution cipher Central processing unit CPU cache IBM PC compatible Diffie-Hellman key exchange Rabin cryptosystem National Security Agency CPU design Ethernet Transmission Control Protocol MP3 Passphrase Tiny Encryption Algorithm Fast bowling Khufu and Khafre Clipper chip Secret sharing Mac OS X SAFER Drill bit A5/1 Pirate decryption MacGuffin (cipher) Modular exponentiation PaX Integer factorization Orders of magnitude (data) Pseudorandom number generator CRYPTREC Digital signature RC5 Computer Error correction and detection Advanced Encryption Standard process Next-Generation Secure Computing Base Sorting algorithm Buffer overflow Pseudorandomness Bombe Telegraphy ElGamal encryption Gas metal arc welding

anyone with norton anti virus ive just installed a few questions just installed norton anti virus to replace my old ntl anti virus am i protected now its installed just done a full scan and it found a low risk tracking cookie it gave me options fix ignore exclude i chose fix and its gone but whats the difference between fix and exclude ive already have a zone alarm firewall installed and i think this norton anti virus has installed another when i did a live update i no its bad to have firewalls as they clash but how do i no if norton definately installed a firewall cant find it in the options but its in the update list im a bit confused hope u no what i mean thanks for ur help you'll have to look at the help page to find out the difference between fix and exclude at a rough guess fix probably means remove exclude means do not remove you should be able to tell which firewall is running because you will probably have an icon in your system tray next to the clock at the bottom right hand of your screen if you hover over the icon with our mouse it will probably say what it is doing it is pointless having firewalls running as they are duplicating your protection and using up unnecessary resources check what is running by using task manager press ctrl alt delete and click on the processes tab  Windows XP Windows 2000 Computer virus Spyware E-mail spam Anti-virus software Firewall (networking) Microsoft Windows Mozilla Firefox OpenBSD Blue screen of death Steam (content delivery) Poker jargon CPU cache Diablo II: Lord of Destruction AmigaOS Bluetooth Gmail Malware Rootkit Internet security DragonFly BSD Buffer overflow Zone Labs Proxy server Linux Spam (electronic) Windows Server 2003 Prostate cancer MDAC System 7 (Macintosh) Windows Vista Broadband Internet access Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Software bug Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Unicode Extreme Programming ITunes PaX Netfilter/iptables Burglar alarm Comparison of web browsers Minesweeper (computer game) Telephone numbering plan Norton Commander Common Unix Printing System Knoppix Web crawler Personal firewall Charles Ives History of the graphical user interface Taskbar Apollo Guidance Computer Thermal power station Screenshot EIA-708 Cytomegalovirus Control Panel (Windows) City of Heroes Computer insecurity Teen Girl Squad Sudoku Screensaver Python programming language AOL Instant Messenger Tank Opera (web browser) Btrieve Trademark Pretty Good Privacy JavaScript WordPerfect IMac FreeBSD Appliance Wget Macromedia Flash DNA Read-copy-update Internet Explorer Colorectal cancer Control-Alt-Delete Cheating in Counter-Strike History of Microsoft Windows Mac OS X Password Dash Architecture of Windows 2000

information about proxys i don't have internet at home and would like to download visual c express edition sp unfortunatly the library computer has some restrictions on it that cause about half of the things i want to download to randomly not work the error messege says to download to a different place because you're not allowed to change the temp folder i was hoping that maybe a proxy would be able to get past this since i can't go to the options to change where it downloads question would a proxy get past this and question if so how do i use a proyx thanks no besides that if you don't have sufficient privileges to adjust ie settings you aren't going to be able to install anything the error is that the file you want to download exceeds the maximum allowable size of the temporary internet files folder which is were everything downloads until it's completely downloaded then ie moves it to where you selected a proxy is a way of connecting to the internet through an intermediary so your immediate isp doesn't know what you're doing  Windows Vista Uploading and downloading Windows XP ITunes Spyware Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act MDAC Windows 2000 Object Desktop Macromedia Flash America Online Gmail Internet Relay Chat E-mail System 7 (Macintosh) Network address translation Proxy server Wget Domain Name System Kazaa File sharing Objective-C Windows registry Visual Basic Spam (electronic) Mac OS X Transmission Control Protocol Computer security Bluetooth Blue screen of death Mod (computer gaming) Steam (content delivery) Mozilla Firefox Floppy disk EMule Windows Explorer IPod .NET assemblies DVD Digital rights management Internet censorship in mainland China File system PlayStation Portable MSN Messenger MAME United States Postal Service Web page OpenBSD Satellite internet PaX Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Musical Instrument Digital Interface Webmail Microsoft Windows Cheating in Counter-Strike Control Panel (Windows) Data retention Perl File Transfer Protocol Internet Copyright infringement of software System/36 Internet privacy Super Nintendo Entertainment System Open source culture NTFS Opera (web browser) Broadband Internet access AmigaOS Censorware Web crawler MP3 Randomness Mouse (computing) BitTorrent HyperText Transfer Protocol Common Unix Printing System Copyright Stopping e-mail abuse Modem Vorbis SonicStage C programming language Solar variation Mandriva Linux Ebook OpenDocument Microsoft .NET Internet Explorer Preboot Execution Environment File Allocation Table P__li Danger Hiptop Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Freenet Firewall (networking) Password

how can i keep my new pc running optimally i just purchased a new dell laptop and received it yesterday i have been taking precautions to keep it running smoothly i installed mcaffee anti virus software i have strictly limited my internet access and web surfing i have no file sharing or instant messaging software and i plan on purchasing and installing webroot spy sweeper in the next few days here are my questions should i continue to limit my web surfing until i install spy sweeper if so which sites can i trust are yahoo google and related big name sites safer will simply using up storage space on my pc have a significant effect on its speed and efficiency that is can i upload music from commercial audio cds a safe source and not worry too much about slowed performance what can i do to keep my machine running fast what should i avoid what other precautions should i start or continue to take in order to keep my computer running optimally firefox or internet explorer for security anti virus by itself is not enough install the full mcafee security suite to get a firewall spyware protection etc the full suites work better best if you mix and match the different pieces doesn't recognize or trust each other and gives you confusing messages the software in the suites from mcafee or norton prevent bad things from getting into your computer some 'spy sweeper' just looks for spyware after it has infected your computer then removes them it's better to block bad things from ever getting in by storage space i take it you mean disk space as long as you still have of free disk space you get that by looking at properties on your disk drive icon in my computer window you don't need to worry when you have less than that amount it takes longer to defragment your disk drive run defragmentation and scan disk on your c disk at least once a month uninstall programs that you won't use for another months avoid free programs from the internet except for well recommended ones like firefox browser and zone alarm firewall which gives away the personal use version so people will gladly pay for the more useful business version once they are hooked they are free because you are offering free program debug service by using them i own two year old dell consumer laptops and i'm having problems with overheating turns out it was already a known problem with the model when i bought them so my advice is to subscribe to the dell users' forums free service and keep up dell experts monitors them and sometimes chimes in with their advice i would use both firefox is easier to use but you need internet explorer to access microsoft and get their free security updates a very important thing to do i would recommended accepting their recommended update policy of installation their update program which downloads the security updates you need unique to your computer and the programs you installed and install them at the time you pick like during dinner  IBM PC compatible Trusted computing Skype Windows Vista AmigaOS Digital rights management Gmail Hard disk E-mail spam Malware Virtual memory Computer security Opera (web browser) Copy protection Internet Windows Server 2003 AOL Instant Messenger Computer Trojan horse (computing) History of Microsoft Windows File system Amiga IPod Microsoft Mac OS X Apple Macintosh MSN Messenger ITunes Embedded system Enterprise content management America Online OpenBSD Mandriva Linux Mozilla Application Suite Internet security Steam (content delivery) Timeline of computing 1990-forward Commodore 64 Computer forensics Web crawler DragonFly BSD Comparison of web browsers Redundant array of independent disks Common criticisms of Microsoft Warez Web hosting System 7 (Macintosh) Phishing Mach kernel Forth programming language Domain Name System Spam (electronic) CPU cache Password Online music store Blue screen of death Browser wars Knoppix Object Desktop Java programming language Computer insecurity Compiler optimization Streaming media Laptop Fritz-chip Proxy server Digital photography Mainframe computer Perl BitTorrent MMORPG Apple Computer HTTP cookie Linspire Mouse (computing) MP3 NPAPI XML Prodigy (ISP) Google OpenOffice.org

surf the net without my boss knowing what i'm looking at my boss won t even allow me to go on to yahoo answers i have to do this surreptitiously is there any way to surf the internet without my boss or it department seeing what i m looking at no or at least they could always know what you're looking at if they had the knowledge skill it's quite simple really the servers that send you the web pages that you're interested in almost always send you the required data in a format html that can be read by knowledgeable people if they can intercept the data they can see what you're doing when you're connecting to your bank a secure connection will be established which they shouldn't be able to monitor but they'd still be able to see the initial request for data to your bank pagewash as recommended by someone below does not work it will make you anonymous for the websites that you visit but not for the people who can intercept the data right before it arrives on your computer like your boss or it dept hidemyass as recommended by another user won't work either it will for the time being circumvent automatic blocking by monitoring software but again your boss and it dept are still able to see what you're doing basically what appears on your screen can appear on their screen with the exception of secure sites such as your bank but they can still see your initial request for contact with your bank in other words look no further and do whatever you want to do from home unless of course you don't mind losing your job over visiting porn sites  HTTP cookie Password Proxy server Domain Name System File Transfer Protocol Common Unix Printing System Spyware Transmission Control Protocol World Wide Web Internet Data retention Website Web traffic Internet privacy Surveillance Web crawler BitTorrent Gmail Enterprise content management Anonymous remailer Windows 2000 E-mail Novell NetWare Ajax (programming) Copy protection Trusted computing Redundant array of independent disks XML Stopping e-mail abuse Kazaa Apollo Guidance Computer Macromedia Flash Wiki Microsoft Search engine optimization Spam (electronic) Cross site scripting Plame affair HTML X Window System Bluetooth Web design Computer Internet censorship in mainland China Simple Mail Transfer Protocol National Weather Service Ebook Opera (web browser) MDAC Computer insecurity Internet Relay Chat PHP History of the Internet ZX Spectrum Skype Uploading and downloading Hello world program Internet fraud BlackBerry Blog Public-key cryptography Streaming media Cyberspace Advance fee fraud Voice over IP System/36 HTML editor HyperText Transfer Protocol Computer virus Web browser Telephone tapping Captcha Phishing Modem Web accessibility Internet Group Management Protocol Call centre Internet forum Mozilla Application Suite Portable Document Format MSN Messenger File system Windows Server 2003 Uniform Resource Locator Grid computing FidoNet Buffer overflow Peer-to-peer Emacs Java programming language Typeface

why is it that when i download anti virus programs it asks me if i want to restart i know its's not a problem with the computer i am just curious is the company trying to download something when the computer is most vulnerable no hurry just curious thanks most programs require you to restart in order for the software to register in the bios no one is trying to sneak anything by you just make sure any downloads or software installs are from reputable companies with proven track records and you'll be fine restart when it stays to restart  Computer virus Malware Booting Blue screen of death Anti-virus software Spyware Linux Software bug Windows XP Copy protection Computer security Mozilla Firefox Microsoft Windows Computer insecurity Virtual memory Microsoft Trusted computing Internet Explorer Knoppix Patch (computing) Computer surveillance CPU design Computer program Software cracking Classic RISC pipeline Commodore 64 Rootkit Opera (web browser) Kazaa Kernel (computer science) Pretty Good Privacy OS/2 Floppy disk Adware Skype Fritz-chip Mach kernel MDAC GNU General Public License Computer programming Melissa worm IBM PC compatible X86 CPU cache Debugging Computer worm Application programming interface Stopping e-mail abuse OpenOffice.org Thread (computer science) Spam (electronic) Podcasting Digital rights management Calculator BIOS Browser wars HyperCard Grokster ITunes Cheating in Counter-Strike Copyleft Trojan horse (computing) Wget File sharing AMD64 Common criticisms of Microsoft USB flash drive Comparison of web browsers Windows Genuine Advantage CP/M Exploit (computer security) Bluetooth Computer science Outlook Express Web crawler LimeWire Software engineering Computer and video games Windows registry Internet security Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Public domain Object Desktop Emulator Buffer overflow Dot matrix printer Steam (content delivery) Motorola 68000 Blaster worm Modem Warez SQL slammer worm 64-bit Addressing mode Programming language Assembly language Perl ZX Spectrum Database W.

how do i remove this virus hacktool rootkit the first question is how do you know you have hacktool most rootkits are stealthy they only get active when you access a secured website such as online banking then surreptitiously they email you login id and password to someplace like russia goodbye bank account if you think you have a rootkit and if you used the internet recently to access secure websites then examine your history for ie click the icon which looks like a sundial for other browsers try ctrl h when you roll your mouse cursor over a history link you should see the complete path a path could even show the url for the secure website your login id and your password all embedded in one big link copy the offending link use tools internet options security restricted sites to block access to that web address notify your banks or credit cards that your security has been hacked and change your passwords i developed my own rootkit blocking system the problem is that you kill it then it reappears everytime you boot you can never completely kill it i'll break it down whenever a virus emerges it creates specific files usually in the windows system directory but they could be in several places run a program like spybot carefully log the complete file name and path of the files that spybot removes create a fake file to occupy the exact location of each infected file take a word processor such as notepad to illustrate make a file called fakefile txt with a line of text like this is my rootkit blocking system copy the fakefile to each subdirectory where the infected file was located example c windows system fakefile txt make as many copies of fakefile txt as you need rename each fakefile txt to the exact name of the infected file example rename filefile txt to badvirus exe change the properties to read only you may need to unlock the infected file before you can delete rename etc i use a shareware program called unlocker http www softpedia com get system system miscellaneous unlocker shtml you may have better results by safe booting i prefer unlocker why does this system work because most rootkits create the same file names in the same locations over and over when they see an existing file they don't think to write over it or create an alternate file name simple and effective but you may need to go one step farther find a program called hijackthis and find a website that will analyze the hijackthis log you post the log they tell you how to fix the problem you may have to remove registry keys here's a simple tip for using my blocking system rename the fakefile using a distinctive combination of upper and lower case characters your blocking version might be named badvirus exe that way you will know it's yours and not the original good luck carld  Password Phishing Gmail Filename extension AmigaOS Stopping e-mail abuse Files-11 Blue screen of death Cross site scripting Uniform Resource Locator Domain Name System File system USB flash drive Mouse (computing) HTTP cookie Mozilla Firefox E-mail spam CPU cache Trusted computing Microsoft Windows Java programming language Trojan horse (computing) Macromedia Flash Web crawler NTFS Anti-virus software RuneScape cheats Windows registry Digital rights management File Transfer Protocol GameFAQs Steam (content delivery) Copy protection Internet Relay Chat Surveillance World Wide Web MDAC Cascading Style Sheets REBOL Opera (web browser) System 7 (Macintosh) Computer forensics Computer security System/36 System/34 Internet fraud Forth programming language Neopets BitTorrent ILOVEYOU Btrieve Password cracking File format Search engine optimization Novell NetWare Emacs Internet Explorer Mach kernel ASCII art Pretty Good Privacy Virtual memory Mydoom Windows Vista OpenBSD Portable Document Format Master Control Program History of the graphical user interface Mozilla Application Suite Windows 3.x Computer Unicode AOL Instant Messenger Enterprise content management PHP Commodore 64 XML Screenshot History of the Internet ITunes Common Unix Printing System HTML element Google PaX Uniform Resource Identifier Hello world program Secure Shell Control-Alt-Delete History of Microsoft Windows

norton anti virus morning so i finally broke down and bought this since my son is always on the computer and we seem to be very slow lately dang runescape anyways i installed it the other day and it seems fine it will pop up that certain things need my attention so when i click on these things they have a low risk now my question is there are options of what i should do ignore fix exclude what do i do what do each of these commands do if i click on them i just feel like its not really doing anything maybe it is but i've never had this or any antivirus protector before so i am at a loss please help thanks keep in mind i am pretty illiterate when it comes to computers i'd first follow the software's recommendation and always make it 'fix' things even if they have low risk given the choice you should always err on the side of caution and remove or fix the problem i say this because this type of software is not foolproof and it may incorrectly categorize something as low risk when it's really not  Anti-virus software Computer virus Computer security Prostate cancer Windows XP Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma RuneScape RuneScape cheats Spyware Stopping e-mail abuse Internet security Extreme Programming Software testing Weight training Pneumonia Folic acid Floppy disk Mouse (computing) USB flash drive RuneScape Random Events Diablo II: Lord of Destruction RuneScape weapons Theory of conduct Poker jargon Filename extension IPod MMORPG Cytomegalovirus Opera (web browser) Virtual memory Debugging RuneScape skills Rootkit Software bug Malware Mozilla Firefox Blue screen of death NX bit Autism Microeconomics Year 2000 problem Betting (poker) Pretty Good Privacy 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Anorexia nervosa Macromedia Flash Mutual fund Trojan horse (computing) Apostrophe (mark) Hard disk Norton AntiVirus Knoppix Computer surveillance Sexual orientation Digital photography Laptop Lung cancer Internet fraud Dieting Computer and video game genres Unicode VHF omnidirectional range Patch (computing) Surveillance Password Cascading Style Sheets Symantec Software engineering Gmail Microsoft Windows Copy protection RuneScape economy Atkins Nutritional Approach Windows Vista RuneScape quests Computer role-playing game Prank flash AmigaOS LiveJournal Drawing StarCraft Secret Missions Dialer Common Unix Printing System Anti-aircraft warfare Undergrads Haloalkane Conscience Risk management Cancer Debt Food and Drug Administration Antiretroviral drug Expert system Atari 8-bit family Linux Intellectual property Hypoglycemia Trusted computing Nuclear power

whats a cookie on the computer anf how do i delete them why sites use cookies there are numerous reasons why websites would want to use cookies these range from statistical purposes such as how many visitors came to the site this can be further broken down into are they new visitors or actually repeating visitors and how often do they visit the website would actually create a unique id for each visitor and store this information into a database cookies can be used to store your personal preferences referred to as customizations that you set while navigating their site for instance if you visit yahoo com you can sign in to create your very own personal yahoo page where you can customize it according to your news and weather preferences after providing your zip code you can even change the color of the page layout as well online shopping sites can use cookies to keep track of items that you add to their shopping carts and quick checkout options the cookie will keep track of every item that you add to the shopping cart while you continue to browse through different pages or even entirely different sections of their site every item you add is stored within the web site s database along with a unique id value that has been assigned to you therefore when you select the check out option the site automatically knows what items are in your cart by retrieving those selections from its database this is why sites such as amazon or ebay will prompt you to enable cookies in case you have disabled them cookies also provide web designers and programmers with a quick and convenient method of keeping their site content fresh and up to date according to the interests of their users modern web servers use cookies for back end interaction as well allowing them to securely store any personal data that the user has entered within a site therefore on return visits the user now only has to enter partial information to access their account and purchases can be made quicker as their payment information is on file regarding their previous purchases in closing as cookies are actually small text files they really can not damage your computer system or any files on your hard drive once again they cannot transmit viruses as viruses are executable in nature some users may just not want to be tracked and this is one of the primary reasons why many people just disable accepting cookies setting your browser to accept or reject cookies internet explorer netscape and firefox provide you with some level of control regarding accepting and rejecting cookies all browsers have menu options that allow you to define their cookie settings where you can enable a screening feature to receive a warning asking you if you would like to accept the site s incoming cookie for the latest versions of netscape and firefox click on the word tools which is contained in your top tool bar area this will pull down a menu for you to now click on options then click on the privacy icon where you will see a cookies tab to click on for firefox netscape displays a listing of privacy settings where you will see cookies within the list when you enter this area you can clear the cookies or choose the option to accept them for the latest version of internet explorer click on the word tools which is contained in your top tool bar area this will pull down a menu for you to now click on internet options then click on the privacy tab located at the top of the options windows then click on the advanced tab to bring up the advanced privacy settings windows this is the area where you can define how cookies are handled on your system etc you will probably recieve several answers to your question whoever helped you the most please come back and give that person best answer  Microsoft Internet fraud Emacs HyperCard Web analytics Search engine optimization HTML element IPod Enterprise content management Ajax (programming) Pretty Good Privacy User agent Netscape Browser Amazon.com SAS System Windows Vista Macintosh Finder Konqueror Phishing E-mail spam Web traffic Unicode Web crawler Blue screen of death Web page System 7 (Macintosh) Virtual memory Open-source software Expert system Steam (content delivery) NPAPI Trusted computing The Internet Movie Database Database Visual Basic RFID Mac OS X v10.4 America Online C plus plus Database management system Internet Explorer for Mac Mac OS X PNG Atari 8-bit family Electronic commerce World Wide Web Screenshot AppleScript Palm OS Embedded system MSN Messenger Classified information Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act
