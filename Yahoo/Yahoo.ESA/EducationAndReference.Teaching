high school teaching question what's your best get to know you activity i'm thinking of doing a couple of different things on the first day but i'm looking for some fresh ideas i'm a high school english teacher and it's important that the kids feel safe in the classroom i start off with an introductory activity so that it won't be so hard to share work with strangers in the following months for those of you that think that building trust in the classroom isn't important i recommend taking some education classes sure it's easy to say that it's a waste of time but how hard is it for a year old to share a poem that he or she has written think of it that way before you answer you're right kids wig out when it comes to sharing what they've written especially when it's got to be shared in speech form it's good to give them some practice early on have you heard of the toilet paper game you ask the kids to tear off a typical amount of toilet paper that they'd use if they've done the activity before they might wise up and just tear off a square but it'll still be silly fun once everyone's torn off their share explain to them that each square they have will represent one thing they'll share about themselves to the class start off yourself to get the ball rolling another thing you could try is to have them write down things about themselves tell them one of the things can't be true when they read them to the class the class has to decide which fact is the one that's made up not only does it allow the students to share things about themselves it also forces them to be creative and it engages the whole class when it comes time to guessing have them write down their top or top of things they like movies music tv shows books for books might as well say you can just let them share them with the class or you can have them interview classmates for the answers and then let their partners introduce them to the class w that information another twist would be to let one person read one of their favorite movies anyone else who has that movie listed on their own top or stands behind that person's desk it'll help them see what they have in common with one another  Theory of conduct A Course In Miracles GED Shaggy dog story Teach the Controversy Extreme Programming I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Columbine High School massacre Drama Scientology beliefs and practices Aesthetic Realism Beavis and Butt-head Socrates Floppy disk Avenue Q Education in the United States Experiential education CPU cache Kodocha Education Aerial (dance move) Big Brother (USA TV series) Care Bears Whose Line Is It Anyway?

having a teaching degree in the us but moving to canada if i have a teaching degree in the us when i move to canada can i still teach or do i have to enroll into a canadian college to gain my degree there and no a new draft hasn't happened i asked because i always wanted to live in canada good news it's unlikely that you will have to take your whole teaching degree over if you have one from a fully accredited college and are certified within your state bad news you'll probably have to take some courses over to be certified where you are going to teach education is the perogative of each of the separate provinces within canada there are historical reasons for this you really don't want the details the upshot of this is when someone graduates with a teaching degree in one part of our country and moves to another part of the country that province's department of education frequently deems some part of the teacher's training credentials as insufficient and requires it to be upgraded it's a turf warfare thing it's unlikely that you will sneak in under the radar dependent upon which province you move to things may be different if you get a job in a private school rather than in the public system in my province manitoba all teachers are required to be fully credentialed whether in the public or private system there tends to be a grace period within which you can hold a job and get the required coursework done once you have landed a job or if you already know what part of the country you are moving to contact that province's department of education for details about certification you will need to send them a copy of your university transcripts and your certification papers to have official word and receive the written documentation of what they are requiring you to do do not leave this to chance or rely on somebody else's say so even if it is your employer welcome to the country  Teacher Graduate school Education in Portugal Education in the United States Education in Australia Education in the People's Republic of China College Education in Hong Kong Education in Germany Education in Malaysia School accreditation Juris Doctor GED City and Guilds of London Institute Paralegal Professor Nurse Lawyer Education in Canada Grade (education) Community college University of Houston Architect Electrical engineering Master's degree Librarian Pretty Good Privacy Education in the Republic of Ireland Education in Japan Software engineering Student loan Reliability engineering Separation of church and state Trinity College, Dublin Ryerson University Columbia University Public education California Baptist University Education in France Physician American University University of North Carolina at Charlotte Pennsylvania State University Higher education in Japan Medicare (Canada) Same-sex marriage in Canada Academia College admissions Dentistry Green Party candidates, 2004 Canadian federal election Medical school King City, Ontario Public-key cryptography Bachelor of Arts Midwifery School counselor Distance education Jaime Escalante Athabasca University Associate's degree Diploma mill Oregon State University Middle Tennessee State University New York State Department of Education Patent Rabbi Charter school University of the State of New York Memorial University of Newfoundland General practitioner Secondary education in Japan Multilingual Doctor of Philosophy Chinese University of Hong Kong Florida State University Law school Advance fee fraud IB Diploma Programme Far Eastern University Medical Assistant Education in Austria Physical therapy Education in Qu__bec General Certificate of Secondary Education Education in Taiwan Air Education and Training Command University of Central Florida Trade union New Brunswick Politics of Canada A-level Unemployment benefit Immigration to the United States Freedom of information legislation

accountant vs teacher which one would you pick and why and why not the other i am a teacher and there are aspects i love about my job however the discipline issues are driving me away from my profession i am in the process of re examining my life and trying to decide whether to leave teaching as the discipline problems will only get worse since children are disciplined less and less at home although teachers can influence a child's life i do think this is over played and over romanticised in a class of kids with the demands of the curriculum there is little time to make a positive impact in a child's life my problem is that teaching is all i know i am highly competent and i am in my early 's if i had my time back knowing what i now know i would probably opt for accounting however as a mother there are definite advantages to being in teaching school holidays being one of them accountant and teaching are on opposite ends of the spectrum dealing with people versus dealing with figures i would imagine accounting to be as stressful and demanding as teaching but with less headaches and frustrations  Education in the People's Republic of China Education Homeschooling Secondary education in Japan Software engineering Graduate school Education in Germany Beavis and Butt-head Asperger syndrome Pitaten Medicine No Child Left Behind Act Boston Public Education in the United States Teacher Aikido Education in Portugal Alexander Technique A-level Second language acquisition Martial art Tai Chi Chuan Education in the Republic of Ireland Hogwarts subjects Economics Tripartite System Psychology Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Teaching English as a Foreign Language Infantilism Karate Transsexuality Education in Malaysia Past teachings of Prem Rawat Education in France Secondary education in France Jehovah's Witnesses Waldorf Education Drama Literacy For Better or For Worse 1957 World Series Experiential education French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Education in Romania Standardized testing Education in Hong Kong Narcissism Danish Folkeskole Education A Course In Miracles Reiki Church of Christ, Scientist Education reform Justification (theology) Profession Philosophy of education Chiropractic Academia Separation of church and state Education in Singapore Creationism Socrates Scientology beliefs and practices Philosophy of language School choice Charles William Eliot Sociology Music Instant-runoff voting Class in the contemporary United States Afrocentrism Marshall McLuhan Creation-evolution controversy The nature of God in Western theology Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Charter school Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Logic Geography Professor Hikikomori Kodocha Church of Christ Tariff Franklin W.

how much supplies does a school provide a teacher i'm going to need a lot of certain supplies and wonder will i have to go buy them or the school provides as many as you need how does this work the only place you are going to get that answer is to ask the school i would suggest asking someone who has taught at your school for a couple of years not only will they be able to tell you what the school will provide but they can explain the process to request supplies if it's acceptable to ask the students to contribute or if the pto parent or community organization contributes anything if you do need to purchase supplies yourself save your receipt for your taxes teachers get to claim up to or somewhere around there each year for classroom supplies and if your school has you purchase supplies and then they will reimburse you make sure that the items on the receipt are only school supplies if you have to purchase dog food and deodorant you'll need to have them on a separate receipt  Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Homeschooling Education in the United States Teach the Controversy Teacher Establishment Clause of the First Amendment Economics Labor theory of value Education reform Town meeting Reaganomics Student loan Primary education Boston Public Separation of church and state United Kingdom corporation tax Catholic school Intelligent design movement Food Stamp Program Credit card No Child Left Behind Act Taxation in the United States Textbook Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Supply and demand Education in Germany French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Education in Romania Education in England A Course In Miracles Education in Hong Kong Board of Cooperative Educational Services Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Contract Measures of national income and output Economy of Maldives United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East Religious education Community High School, Ann Arbor, Michigan Education Publicly funded medicine Article One of the United States Constitution Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ethical consumerism SAT Reiki School choice Insurance Microeconomics Experiential education Fort Ashby, West Virginia Creation and evolution in public education Say's law Value added tax Kitzmiller v.

i am en english teacher how can i use a wiki in my class i have been thinking about this since last semester i too am looking at using this in the classroom for those who do not know a wiki is the style that wikipedia publishes in you start with blank pages and the users create the content the idea in a classroom is that your students would create the content a powerful benefit is that sites that host wikis keep all prior drafts within their system you can refer to any previous drafts easily a teacher can see what a student wrote and have the entire draft history available i have thought of one thing i might try this coming year i will do the pre work to create pages for each class and each student within the class for small assignemtns i will post a general question on the front page students are to answer on their individual pages for a longer assignment i plan to have them write up their lab reports in this manner i look forward to seeing others who have better ideas than this i really want to try it out it does seem like i will have to do alot of training of my students for this to work good luck  Education in Romania Extreme Programming Wiki Education in Germany Independent Media Center Plan 9 (operating system) Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Teach the Controversy Expert system Experiential education Education in Taiwan Graduate school Wikipedia University of Massachusetts Amherst Japanese tea ceremony Website Stuyvesant High School Education Logic GED Education in the United States Many-worlds interpretation Webcomic Yearbook Visual Basic King George V School PHP Blog Intelligent design movement No Child Left Behind Act Meme Center for Science and Culture ITunes Homestar Runner Wiki Professor Aikido Education in the People's Republic of China Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Columbine High School massacre Alexander Technique Uniform Resource Locator RSS (file format) Cascading Style Sheets HTML element Internet troll Plame affair History of Wikipedia Socrates Uncyclopedia Gwinnett University Center Podcasting Lisp programming language Smalltalk WikiWikiWeb Massachusetts Institute of Technology Conscription Model United Nations Juris Doctor Bristol Grammar School Open access Jimmy Wales Wiki vandalism Standardized testing GameFAQs Education in Portugal TikiWiki Blended learning Plato Current teachings of Prem Rawat Green Party of Canada Living Platform Republic (dialogue) The nature of God in Western theology Starfleet ranks and insignia Teacher Secondary education in Japan Password H2G2 SAT The Hidden Curriculum Hopkins School Hyperlink Python programming language John Wycliffe Catechism Ken Wilber Scalable Vector Graphics Philosophy of education Education reform Bridgewater State College MediaWiki Web hosting Pittsburgh Steelers Forth programming language Tcl A Course In Miracles LaTeX Roman law Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder

hi i have a project about the home education i want c ur opinions as soon as possible me i prefer the schools but it seems that marie curie didn't so i will b happy c ur oppinions and what do u think about the advantages disadvantages of the home school education i had both growing up i was home schooled from th grades it was good and bad just as is public schools with homeschool it was hard for me since i liked sports and when you are homeschooled your not able to play for the school sports teams also you miss out on the interaction with all the other students the good thing about it was that i was able to spend good quality time with my parents and brother and sister i also got to wear whatever the heck i wanted and was able to do school work around life situations that come up the good thing about public school is it teaches you more about interaction with others you are also more disciplined i think because you have to abide by the same rules as thousands of other of students also you get to participate in the sports in each you have field trips and activities but with home school these field trips are your only interaction with other homeschooled children i think the education you get is about the same but with home school you do more school work than public school  Education in the United States Waldorf Education Education Graduate school Education in Australia Autodidacticism School choice Marie Curie Education in Germany No Child Left Behind Act Pitaten Education in Portugal Patrick Henry College Experiential education GED A.

are charter schools performing better than public schools why do teacher unions make bad press of charters charter school teachers don't have to join the local teachers' union the union cannot collect dues from them and lose out on that money charter school test scores are comparable with public schools they aren't above and beyond q what is a charter school a it's a public school that operates under a contract or charter between the people who are to run the school and the public agency or official authorized to issue the charter local school boards and the state superintendent of public instruction can issue a charter the charter school gets tax money like other public schools although new charter schools would get local levy money only from levies approved after the school opens q what's in the charter a the terms and conditions for the management operation and educational program of the charter school according to the law that must include how the school will be governed its mission its proposed curriculum and documentation of its financial viability q how is a charter school different from a regular public school a it can operate outside the regular administrative structure of the local school district and school board free of many state regulations that means the operators can hire whom they want as principal or as teachers can choose curriculums and set up a schedule for the school day and year for example independently of the district administration and school board q what about union contracts between school districts and teachers a teachers at a new charter school can't join the districtwide union for the first five years of the school's operation at that point they can elect to join they can form their own collective bargaining unit in the first five years but it will be limited to that one school http seattlepi nwsource com local charter html  Charter school Public education School choice Political subdivisions of New York State Town meeting Government of Maryland Education in the United States Politics of the United States Board of Cooperative Educational Services Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Japan No Child Left Behind Act Miami-Dade County Public Schools Education in England Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Commune in France United Kingdom corporation tax Political divisions of the United States Government of France Independent agencies of the United States government Martin J.

what is ur opinion on corporal punishment do u thnk it is necessary fr schools i thnk teachers shld be very friendly da students rather thn optin fr harsh methods corporal punishment is an abuse fr da whole teachin facility so friends pls post in ur views n say whether it is rite fr our nation corporal punishment is not just hitting corporal punishment these days is almost any disciplinary action a teacher takes if you yell at a child that is considered corporal punishment if you separate a disruptive child from the rest of the class by sitting him to the side that is even considered corporal punishment if you have a child write i will try to work on my behavior times that is corporal punishment it is so easy for people to say a teacher should be friendly but it is obvious they have never been teachers teachers are dealing with more than the old class clown we are physically and verbally assaulted every day we are treated disrespectfully by students and their parents we are underpaid and overworked and yet we are still dedicated to teaching kids i don't believe in paddling or smacking or physical abuse but if i want to remove a disruptive student from the group why is that wrong instead of saying teachers should be friendly how about saying students should be respectful obedient cooperative and ready to learn how about saying parents should be cooperative supportive and ready to listen and help i wish every person who thinks of this question would go and spend a week in a school and then rethink their answer i almost agree with horse except for the hip hop gangsta bit all kids act up preppy kids rebels druggied rockers punks grunge skaterboarders there are all kinds of problematic groups of kids its not just a hip hop gangsta issue thats a bit stereotypical in my opinion basically if students go to school and act respectfully and do their work they wont have any problems from a teacher  Spanking High school subcultures Theory of conduct Corporal punishment Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Socrates Alexander Technique Dog training School discipline Capital punishment Punishment Education in the United States Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hazing Hip hop music Coercion Adolescence Social psychology SAT Saved by the Bell Scientology beliefs and practices Education in the People's Republic of China Abortion debate Divorce Domestic violence Teacher No Child Left Behind Act Motivation Moral Politics Separation of church and state Drug addiction Philosophy of education Columbine High School massacre Confucianism Aikido Status of religious freedom in Sudan Catechism Human sexual behavior Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Teach the Controversy Ludwig Wittgenstein Drama Abortion Timeline of trends in music from the United States (1970-Present) Milgram experiment W.I.T.C.H.

good elearning g science course for my kid my son wants to be homeschooled for valid reasons and i am looking for a good onloine grade science course for him any suggestions i don't know of any pre fab online science courses per se most science instruction in schools is moving away from pure textbook approaches one source only towards more hands on approaches focusing on experimentation and design processes the online learning resources i've encountered have been just that tools to draw upon to teach concepts not fully designed courses for a child to read work their way through it seems to me that if you are going to be responsible for your son's homeschooling your first step is to check out what the topics are that he needs to be learning about in your home state province or country most departments of education are posting these online nowadays then to prime the pump with some basic information you could take out a membership with brainpop com for the planning of some actual learning activities you could look at a resource like curriculum navigator at the site listed below it helps you to plan lesson and unit activities that frequently come with some support materials that are only a click away once again i don't know whether this resource will match up with what your son needs for where you are living create an account at http www edu gov mb ca cn login jsp then click on create learning experiences it's pretty straightforward from there on in once again your government's department of education or local school district is your most accurate resource for what your child should be learning and how they could be learning it good luck let me know how it goes hi there kept thinking about your problem and did some looking came up with some more info found the following recommended websites in the homeschooling discussion area you might want to check in with people there who are used to dealing with this subject http www sonlight com by level html http www k com the first one is a christian based program that seems to have programming geared to what i assume is your child's age range it just seems a little difficult to nail down a clear grade level the site seemed to be set up in a quite byzantine manner so i wasn't able to figure out whether it was set up to take just one subect at that level or whether you need to sign on for the whole program the second site a secular one was set up very clearly however after being very clearly labeled kindergarten to grade five the science options are just generally labelled by broad categories earth science life science and physical science their recommendation for grade is essentially choose one i gathered from scanning your other questions that you are based in ontario i hadn't been clear on your location when i had first responded to your question if you are anywhere in canada the curriculum navigator topics for grade eight science should be applicable wishing you great luck still hoping to hear how it goes hi there more information check out http www connectionsacadamy com they seem to have a very clear grade eight course option  Education in the United States GED Education in the People's Republic of China Education Waldorf Education Gmail Education in Japan Economics Logic Scientology beliefs and practices Software engineering Intelligent design movement Graduate school Legal research Teach the Controversy Domain Name System Open access Mathematics Object-oriented programming Education in Australia Massachusetts Institute of Technology No Child Left Behind Act JavaServer Pages Prostate cancer XML Law school Philosophy Geography Uniform Resource Locator Extreme Programming Experiential education HTTP cookie Biology Secondary education in Japan High school Cognitive science E-learning Education in Germany Public education Enterprise content management HyperText Transfer Protocol Education in Hong Kong Grade (education) World Wide Web Geographic information system Open Directory Project IB Diploma Programme Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Psychology Education in Malaysia Education in Singapore Creation-evolution controversy Theory of conduct Alcoholics Anonymous PLATO Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Tripartite System Education reform Expert system The Skeptical Environmentalist Medical school Civil Air Patrol Python programming language Presuppositional apologetics PHP Law of value Science Physics Kasparov versus The World A-level Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Boy Scouts of America Literacy Intelligent design Common Unix Printing System Motivation Microeconomics Caulfield Grammar School Search engine optimization A Course In Miracles Web crawler Compiler optimization Charter school Database management system Advanced Placement Program Center for Science and Culture Cross site scripting Test (student assessment) Education in Romania Autism

power of memory education today spends too much time in terms of increasing memory skills i am in favor of memory because there are things that simply need to be memorized however i see beyond the memorization process for example as a math major i needed to literally memorize hundreds of formulas for trig calculus differential equations abstract algebra differential geometry and the list goes on i took time however to learn how to derive formulas not just memorize them math teachers love to say memorize this and you should be fine for the upcoming test what about after the test what about if i ever see those questions again are you following i believe that education should not solely forcus on memory but in actual learning your view i don't want to tell you how old i am but i took calc stats before graphing calculators i don't think my kids understand as well as i did at their age it's easier to memorize and promptly forget or learn how to plug things into a calculator and have everything magically appear i agree i think school should be about learning too much emphasis has been on testing well whether it is standardized or in class  Mathematics Calculus Derivative Polynomial Algebraic geometry Manifold Function (mathematics) Special relativity Mathematics education Education Tensor Complex number Trigonometric function Explosive material Pi Geometry Ordinary differential equation Integral Mnemonic Slope TI-89 series Logic Arthur Cayley Finite element method Calculator Curve Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Gross domestic product Stuyvesant High School Numerical analysis Axiom Leonhard Euler Laws of Form Memory Trigonometric identity Formal power series Philosophy of mathematics Education in Taiwan William Rowan Hamilton Where Mathematics Comes From Supply and demand Mathematics of general relativity Aberration in optical systems Joseph Louis Lagrange Homeschooling Test (student assessment) Category theory Microeconomics Exponentiation Exponential function Education in Romania Model (economics) G__del's incompleteness theorem Education in the People's Republic of China Black-Scholes Vector (spatial) Physics Dyslexia Infinity Algebra Logarithm Richard Feynman Elliptic curve Burkhard Heim TI-92 series No Child Left Behind Act Model (abstract) Combinatorial species Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) UBASIC The Princeton Review Computer numbering formats Probability Differential geometry and topology Timeline of mathematics General relativity TI-83 series Differential geometry of curves Astrodynamics Jaime Escalante Group theory Gauge theory Normal distribution Determinant Scientific method New math Computer algebra system Economics Tangent space Covariance and contravariance Graph theory Expert system Convergence of Fourier series Graphing calculator Differential operator Areas of mathematics

should i take this job i am a special ed teacher and i was offered a new job by a different school district this year i resigned from my last position the end of the school year the reason being i didn't like the micromanagement lack of flexibility criticism or the severe needs of the students the position at this school is a little different but it is still special ed and the principal seems eager to hire me my dilema is that i have some hesitations with accepting this position because of the problems of this previous year the real pro for this position is the salary i'm looking at other job positions within the school system non teaching accepting a different position will mean less pay but less responsibility more flexibility and less stress please give me any constructive input or advice i just want to make sure that i am not over thinking this thing or jumping the gun it seems to me that you've burned out on special ed which happens to many se teachers at any time in their career how long have you been an se teacher teaching is hard enough but the trials and difficulties double with special ed students so it's no wonder that you're conflicted perhaps the best way to deal with your dilemma is to take the compensation element out of the equation and consider the importance of reduced stress peace of mind and the feeling that you're doing your best in the capacity which suits your current frame of mind conversely if you want to leave the compensation element in consider how much of a decrease in salary you have to take to accept the non teaching position would you be able to adjust your standard of living or spending habits to be able to afford the decreased salary are the benefits of the non teaching job similar or would you have to compromise benefits as well i believe peace of mind and a stress free life are tantamount to living a good life but you have to decide what will allow you to live that way i hope this helps good luck  Education in the People's Republic of China Microeconomics Professor Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Aikido Education in Japan Graduate school Gross domestic product Unemployment Economic inequality Tai Chi Chuan A Course In Miracles Supply and demand Boston Public Past teachings of Prem Rawat Education Publicly funded medicine Principal-agent problem Scientology beliefs and practices Alexander Technique Education in Portugal Education in the United States Affirmative action Salary cap Dog agility Philosophy of space and time Education in Germany Operational amplifier Social rule Tariff Inflation Current teachings of Prem Rawat Alcoholics Anonymous Game programmer Car handling Contract Capitalism Free trade Final Fantasy XI Reiki Air traffic controller Secondary education in Japan Tripartite System Extreme Programming Summa Theologiae No Child Left Behind Act Infantilism Software engineering Teach the Controversy Meditation Strategic management Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Welding Hogwarts subjects Education in Hong Kong Insurance Equine conformation Corporate governance Nuclear power Separation of church and state Labor theory of value Prisoner's dilemma Freeters Socrates Software patent debate 2004-05 NHL lockout Education in Romania Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Kyoto Protocol Mutual fund Property (ownership right) Psychoanalysis Wal-Mart Call centre Unemployment benefit Workers' compensation Second language acquisition Homeschooling Non-native pronunciations of English Jet engine New Deal Breastfeeding Canadian and American health care systems compared Chinese martial arts Life insurance Mountain bike Democracy Economics Indian Round Table Conferences 1931-1933 Time Out of Mind Workplace democracy Israeli Arab

what nationality do koreans look for the most as english teachers pronunciation seems so important but i see english teachers from all over some not even their native tongue having taught english in korea myself i have found that the actual native tongue is not nearly as important as your ability to keep the student's attention most students who are learning english are doing so because their parents force them to not because they want to learn it so having some korean speaking skills is essential but as for nationality doesn't matter i have friends who teach english from all over canada usa russia philippines new zealand australia britain you name it some barely pronounce well enough to understand let alone teach good luck  Korean language Multilingual English language Martial art Non-native pronunciations of English German language International English Hanja Hangul Chinese language English as an additional language Regional accents of English speakers Education in South Korea Russian language College American and British English differences Manually Coded English Teacher Vietnamese language Teaching English as a Foreign Language Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Pinyin African American Vernacular English Bilingual education Second language acquisition Simplified Chinese character Standard Mandarin Education Cardcaptor Sakura Spanish language Chinese character Vowel Esperanto Standard Cantonese Welsh language Esperanto as an international language New Zealand English Suzuki method History of Korea (1900___1950) Education in Singapore Urdu Language education International Phonetic Alphabet Australian English American Sign Language Foreign language Literacy Dutch language Phoneme Greek language New York-New Jersey English Hungarian language Franz Boas Tagalog language South African English Languages of Hong Kong Hawaiian language Korean name Lists of television channels M__ori language Contemporary culture of South Korea Spanish in the Philippines Hawaii First language Classical Chinese Mandarin (linguistics) Irish language Bulgarian language Japanese language Family name Past teachings of Prem Rawat High school Great Teacher Onizuka Latin spelling and pronunciation Latin Romanization Taiwanese (linguistics) Languages of the Philippines Singlish Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction South Korea Hong Kong English Indonesian language Pentecostalism Gifted Engrish Archery at the 2004 Summer Olympics Christianity in Korea American English Daria Tai Chi Chuan Old Tongue Philippine English Phonology Koan Korean martial arts Dictionary

teaching english in korea can earn me how much i hear you can do it privately or with an academy but academies sometimes jerk you around and don't pay on time actually this is a good question and the answer is truly up to you if you go the business corporation route you can earn over a million won per week or about us a week you can teach independently choosing well to do students and earn perhaps us an hour but this may require you to travel and teach in homes of doctors lawyers and officials teaching for an institute is usually the low end of the spectrum perhaps w million per month us plus room and board which you likely will share with other english teachers  Education in the United States Graduate school Education in France Education in Germany College Professor Education in Portugal National Kidney Foundation Singapore Wal-Mart Teacher Juris Doctor Education in Australia Education in Romania Donald Rumsfeld Barrister FairTax MMORPG Columbia University Citigroup Wheel of Fortune Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses GED Teach the Controversy Ross School of Business Hogwarts Lawyer Student loan Corporation Education in South Korea John Edwards Physician Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Far Eastern University Enron Corporation Education in Scotland A Course In Miracles Separation of church and state Ra (board game) Education Advanced Placement Program Warren Buffett Nurse Education in Japan Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

why are most teachers in higher learning establishments liberal i mean when my son went to harvard he came back and wanted to become a bread maker in italy he believed in reperations and actually believed that anyone who is afraid of the dark is racist and that black children are afraid of the light but luckily he got a job at ubs so all the crap he believed has ended they had to go to school to get there they spent to year kissing the ashes of various faculty members they have told the same lie so many times to appease a professor that they end up believing it themselves most of the conservatives of my generation did our post graduate work in vietnam that left the liberal elements to go to canada england or elsewhere and get fancy diplomas in underwater basket weaving then it was all is forgiven and a blanket amnesty was issued to the cowards they came home with their fancy diplomas and that's were it started i do encourage you to have some patience liberals are killing off million perspective voters a year in the form of abortions the only way liberals can add to the voter rolls it to add to the welfare rolls in another or years i anticipate a significant change the conservatives took the house of representative in the very year the first aborted babies would have voted is that a coincidence the last election was not a liberal overpowering of conservatives it was a lot of conservatives who were pissed off and fired their representatives  Liberal Democrats (UK) Politics of Canada Canadian federal election, 2004 Democracy EastEnders Plurality electoral system Canadian federal election, 1993 Elections in the United Kingdom Alan Keyes Tom Brinkman Margaret Thatcher Conservative Party (UK) Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) Paul Martin Tom DeLay Democratic Party (United States) Fancy Crane Knots Landing Franklin D.

how can i be certified teacher in texas i have a degree in business education is there a way to take a short cut where i can just take a test and be approved to teach in texas without having to take alternative courses my interest is mostly on special education where did you obtain your degree i mean in what state if you obtained it outside of texas i don't think you have much choice but to either go through alternative certification or through a graduate degree if you did get it at a university in texas then contact your university i'm not really sure about your degree but it seems that if education is part of the degree then you took education courses just call your university and see if they will give you the barcode to register for the certification exams by the way here's the link to the website to register for certification exams but like i said you won't be able to get very far into the registration process without either a barcode from either your university or an alternative certification program or by already being certified and having an id through sbec http www texes ets org do you have certification in another state it may just be a matter of getting your credentials reviewed by the state board of educator certification here's the website for sbec http www sbec state tx us sbeconline default asp sadly there is no short cut you can't just take a test texas as well as the rest of the country is very strict about this thanks to no child left behind i would however recommend you look into either an alternative certification program that can put you on a faster track the one i went through had three different cohort programs i chose the one that would allow me to begin my teaching at the beginning of a school year but there are faster programs the good thing is that they require you to have a teaching job to complete the program you have to teach and yes you'll be paid for a year under their supervision i don't know what area you live in but the education service center that serves your area will likely have the best alternative certification program here's the link to find out which center serves your area http www tea state tx us esc nav nodeid  Education in Portugal Teacher Nurse Physician Education in Germany Graduate school Education in Australia Juris Doctor High school Education in Hong Kong Education in the United States School counselor City and Guilds of London Institute Architect IB Diploma Programme College admissions Paralegal SAT A-level Medical Assistant Education in Romania Education in the Republic of Ireland No Child Left Behind Act Community college Certification Advanced Placement Program Education in Malaysia Education in the People's Republic of China American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Software engineering New York State Department of Education GED General practitioner Associate's degree Master's degree Education in Sweden Librarian College The Princeton Review Professional Engineer Law school Junior Certificate Accountancy Medical school Lawyer Attorney at Law University of Texas at San Antonio Podiatrist Domain Name System Victorian Certificate of Education Master of Laws Uniform Resource Locator National Certificate of Educational Achievement Education in Taiwan Education in Japan Education in Scotland Education in Austria Patent attorney Leaving Certificate Notary public Affirmative action UCAS Higher School Certificate Doctor of Philosophy Texas A&M University-Texarkana University of the State of New York Air Education and Training Command Physical therapy Bologna process Academia University of Houston Public education Education in India Education in France Homeschooling Public domain Bachelor of Arts Kaplan Higher education in Japan Postgraduate Certificate in Education Jaime Escalante Motion picture rating system ZIP Code Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Education in Finland Gwinnett University Center Certified Financial Planner Australian Qualifications Framework AMA Computer University Secondary education in France South Australian Certificate of Education Organic certification Distance education Driver's license Trinity College, Dublin Pennsylvania State University Far Eastern University Education in Singapore

same teacher i will be retaking a class with the same teacher again the teacher was really cool when i first took the class with him unfortunately i was looking for a higher grade than i got so the same teacher is lecturing the class again i am afraid of taking his class eventhough he was one of the best teachers i had my fear of taking his class is i am afraid he might frown upon me or look at me as an idiot do you think my fear is justified your fear is justified i'd be afraid too however you shouldn't have shame for taking the class again it's awesome you're willing to re do it in order to get a better grade power to you my suggestion is that you talk to the teacher tell him that you wanted to take the class again in order to do better and perhaps learn something new ask for any suggestions on how to do better on their tests and assignments if he's really cool he should be more than happy to help you talk to other students who did well in the class too ask what they did in particular that helped them do so well  Grade (education) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school Education Alexander Technique The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Hogwarts subjects Murdock-Portal Elementary School GED Martial art Teachers (film) Gifted Aikido Great Teacher Onizuka Education in the United States No Child Left Behind Act Education in Romania A-level Education in Hong Kong Azumanga Daioh Prostate cancer Boston Public Waldorf Education Propaedeutic value of Esperanto School violence YuYu Hakusho College Education in Germany Homeschooling Gifted Education Programme (Singapore) Teacher's Pet (Disney) Bart vs. Lisa vs. The Third Grade Education in Portugal Kodocha Code: Lyoko The Sims 2: University SAT Primary education Education in Malaysia Secondary education in France Grade inflation Teacher Negima Education in Taiwan Singlish Irish syntax Phoebe Halliwell Education in South Korea Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Secondary education in the United States Hogwarts Noam Chomsky Philosophical skepticism Standardized testing Miami-Dade County Public Schools African American contemporary issues Education in Japan Milton H.

whats a good class activity for college students my organization has classes that you must attend before you join at the last class i want there to be an activity to have them look back on the classes six weeks long all the classes have an activity but we dont have one for the final class any ideas we have a strich no alcohol policy with our orgnization and our school and seriously that wasnt a very good idea we want to make leaders out of students not drunks a fellow teacher does this with her juniors in high school but i think it would translate she has them write a letter to themselves she holds the letter for one year and then mails it to them she provides the stamped envelopes and she has been amazed by some the things her students have said after hearing their thoughts from the year before if you want something with more immediate impact perhaps you could have them make posters detailing their favorite parts of your class these could then serve as visual aids or at least decorations for the next group that comes through it's hard to come up with more specific ideas without knowing more about the nature of your class good luck  Yearbook College Mail Education in Germany Student Community college Postage stamp Education in the United States Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Graduate school Lynbrook High School Grade (education) Hunter College High School James Ruse Agricultural High School Undergrads Education in Japan College admissions Alcoholics Anonymous Angela Davis Education in the People's Republic of China Secondary education in France Teen Girl Squad Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold Homecoming (tradition) Extreme Programming Envelope Glenbrook North High School Intelligent design movement Columbine High School massacre One Tree Hill (TV series) Surveillance Friedrich Schleiermacher Mail art Socrates Education in Romania Negima Fraternities and sororities Lyndon LaRouche Plato Carnegie Mellon University Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Prom Hopkins School Aesthetic Realism Walt Disney World College Program Teach the Controversy High school Marshall McLuhan Marching band Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets Alan Watts Independent school (UK) Ludwig Wittgenstein Twelve-step program Franklin W.

need suggestions for worksheets for a high school writing class my students will be working on improving their writing i would like to give them worksheets that will also allow them to continue practing on their writing skills any suggestions or websites i can go to one idea i had were a worksheet of a paragraph full of errors for them to correct i like to be creative too so please share any ideas you have you could start with the details from this question and let them find mistakes and correct them for someone with an english degree you made a surprisingly large amount of mistakes i don't mean this to be offensive although i realize it will come across that way but if this is standard for you you need to up your game before you can start teaching writing i also think you should avoid worksheets in a writing class unless the worksheets are handouts about grammar or contain vocabulary words to help enhance writing instead you should focus your efforts on creative writing prompts and go from there give students the opportunity to write and revise and then let them exchange their writing with their classmates their classmates can then make suggestions and find mistakes you could even give students a form to fill out when critiquing work that makes them think about why something is written well or poorly this will be far more constructive and beneficial for students because everyone starts on a different level in writing it's hard to give cookie cutter worksheets that will actually help everyone it's better to focus on individual needs it's more time consuming but it really is the best way to help students best wishes  Second language acquisition A Course In Miracles Quizbowl GED Education in Japan Tai Chi Chuan Extreme Programming Slot machine No Child Left Behind Act Franz Boas Mutual fund Non-native pronunciations of English Korean language Scientology beliefs and practices Esperanto as an international language Translation memory Indian English Translation Chinese language Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Education Education reform IB Diploma Programme Graduate school Linus Pauling Austrian School Gifted Law School Admissions Test Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Francis Crick Capitalism Keynesian economics Medical prescription Japanese tea ceremony Intelligent design movement ISO 9000 SAT Rudolf Steiner Chinese character Multilingual Martial art TOEFL The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex American and British English differences John Lott African American Vernacular English Table tennis Danish Folkeskole Education Master's degree Education in Australia Alexander Technique Quattro Pro Education in Singapore Scientific method Gender-neutral language Education in India The Book of Five Rings Hong Kong English Blackjack Ultimate (sport) Condon Committee Grade (education) Independent school (UK) Deconstruction New Testament English language Vladimir Nabokov Neuro-linguistic programming Yearbook Political correctness Ludwig Wittgenstein Open access Cornish language Art Game programming Ido Typewriter Inflation Education in the People's Republic of China Creation science Eye Liberalism Milton H.

to be an accounting teacher i have been in college for two years now going for a bachelor's in accounting and business administration i love accounting but i sometimes ponder what it would be like to be a teacher i enjoy being able to inspire people with thoughts and ideas if i wanted to become a high school accounting teacher like the man who inspired me to enjoy accounting would i need to go back and get a degree in education teaching too or would the road i am on right now with my accounting degree eventually lead me to be a teacher i just figured this was a way to be able to do both of my passions i love accounting but i don't want to be an accountant and i think it would be really great to be a teacher they really deserve a lot more credit than they get sometimes in fact if it wasn't for my high school accounting teacher i probably wouldn't even be in college trying to get a degree is it possible to be both without going back for a teaching degree its good to se somebody praising a teacher well comming to your question generally to be a teacher u need a master degree but in most reputed colleges and universitites a degree in teaching is mandatory since u have passion in teaching doing a degree in teaching is worth spending money and time u need not worry because u r already in the correct path only thing is that u need some expertise in accounting hope for the best best of luck  Education in Germany Graduate school Teacher Education in Portugal Education in the United States College Avenue Q Education Church of Christ, Scientist Master's degree Chinese University of Hong Kong Far Eastern University The College of New Jersey Socrates Juris Doctor Buddhism Theory of conduct Community college Columbia University University of Houston Master of Business Administration Academic degree Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Finland Medical school A Course In Miracles Academia Great Teacher Onizuka Education in Japan Education in Malaysia Professor Ball State University Law school Ramakrishna City and Guilds of London Institute Degrees of Oxford University Christian Brothers University Salt Lake Community College Jiddu Krishnamurti Western Kentucky University Stoicism Summa Theologiae Blood on the Tracks Athabasca University University of Phoenix Reiki Israel ben Eliezer Past teachings of Prem Rawat Education reform Current teachings of Prem Rawat Divine grace Knots Landing Brian Jones (musician) Librarian Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania Ludwig Wittgenstein Aesthetic Realism Shaggy dog story Education in France Indiana State University Charter school University of Chester Education in the Republic of Ireland Education in Australia Seneca College Confucius Franklin W.

do highschool teachers keep a student's freshman summer homework if it's good like the summer paper before the start of freshman year and keep it in the student's file and can teachers remember something like that if it was years ago it sounds like you are considering cheating and copying someone else's paper the fact that you don't know the answer to your questions makes me think you are nervous and perhaps feeling guilty about what you are about to do i keep all major papers in case something sounds familiar later on especially glaring muistakes with that said most kids who will allow you to cheat from them make mistakes in their writing don't do it it's not worth the risk you are better off writing something that is mediocre than something that may get you a zero and in trouble on the first days of school  Education in Romania Test (student assessment) Shaggy dog story Social rule Grade (education) Theory of conduct Student Password Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Socrates Homework GED Current teachings of Prem Rawat The Ashlee Simpson Show French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Massachusetts Institute of Technology Education in the United States Gifted Asperger syndrome Secondary education in France Teen Girl Squad Teachers (film) Yearbook Hey Jude A Course In Miracles Double the Fist Code: Lyoko Baylor University The Citadel (Military College) Singlish Dyslexia The Hidden Curriculum Williams College Boston Public Quizbowl Saved by the Bell The writing of Principia Mathematica Steam (content delivery) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Plame affair African American Vernacular English Russ Eddie Guerrero Philosophical skepticism Recess (TV series) Halting problem Paper Non-native pronunciations of English University of Massachusetts Amherst Sampling (music) Graduate school The Catcher in the Rye Texas A&M University Corps of Cadets Harvard University Ronnie Earle Aesthetic Realism Cheating Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder The Adventures of Pete & Pete Standardized testing Homestar Runner Gettysburg Address Richard Feynman Brian Jones (musician) One Tree Hill (TV series) Dazed and Confused (film) Sydney Riot of 1879 Teacher Ben Johnson (athlete) The Beach Boys Student loan Hey Arnold!

what to learn high german or low german hi i am starting to learn this language so what to start high german or low german guide me are low and high german two different dialects or two different languages finally what to choose why high german is standard german i e the official language of germany the language that most german speakers are able to speak even if it's not their native dialect and the language that is used for almost all german literature and media low german is a local dialect spoken by some people in the north of germany and it's unlikely that you would ever have to use it unless you have a special interest in traditions of northern germany my mother was raised in northern germany and is a native low german speaker but has not used it for decades as she has nobody to speak it with i also spent a part of my childhood in north germany and heard only old people speaking it and even that rarely i can understand it but not speak it my mother has almost never talked in low german to me but almost always in high german i like low german it has a nice sound and all and i appreciate it if people learn it to save it from vanishing but high german is definitely more useful it is also what is usually taught when german is taught as a foreign language  Standard Mandarin English language Finnish language Dutch language Germanic languages Swiss German Danish language Standard Cantonese Chinese language Frisian language Urdu Russian language Hindi Swedish language Spanish language Irish language Mandarin (linguistics) Korean language Javanese language Non-native pronunciations of English Japanese language Italian language English as an additional language Tamil language Hebrew language Afrikaans Low German languages Greek language West Frisian language M__ori language Serbo-Croatian language Slovenian language Bengali language Languages of France Languages of Hong Kong Alemannic German Inuit language Arabic language Standard language Inuktitut International English Ulster Scots language Teochew (dialect) Taiwanese (linguistics) Languages in the United Kingdom High Germanic languages Multilingual Esperanto as an international language Occitan language French language Dialects of Mandarin Ukrainian language Thai language Welsh language Languages in the United States Tone (linguistics) Diglossia Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Guttural R Foreign language Wolof language Alsace Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics South Slavic languages Indonesian language Yiddish language Scots language Yoruba language Pinyin Italy Portuguese Creole West Country dialects Dialect Standard Swedish First language Czech language Alsace-Lorraine Austrian German Northern Low Saxon language Hungarian language Esperanto Low Saxon language American English Sami languages Written Cantonese Tagalog language Hong Kong English Finnish phonology Catalan language Cantonese (linguistics) Cornish language Languages in Star Wars West Germanic languages Chinese character Saterland Frisian language Austria Vowel

what are some good excuses to switch classes i was going to say that i prefered the other teachers but that would be hard to get into the class if i just wanted the other teacher i really need some excuses what's the real reason for wanting to switch classes is it just because you don't like the teacher perhaps you can talk about how the teaching methods of one teacher better suit your needs you'd have to be ready to explain how that is it's worth a shot  Aikido Kodocha Bart chalkboard gags Who Shot Mr. Burns?

year old can't remember multiplication facts my brother has add and was always a slow learner but he is going to be in th grade and he can't remember his multiplication fatcs off the top of his head he has books flash cards and other things but he just can't memorize them i have been helping him practice all summer but i was wondering if there is a better method of teaching him and helping him remember thanks you are doing a great job to help him he might find it helpful to listen to multiplication rap or other versions of songs as a math teacher every year i have students who benefit from having a multiplication chart handy on their desk for example when we are working on long multiplication using decimals i'm making sure they know the steps to lead to the final answer some students need help with their basic facts but know exactly what to do to add the zero place holders put in the decimal point etc i'm not going to let a student who is hung up on the basic facts sit there and struggle through it he she can use a chart and show me they know the lesson the facts will come when he's ready your at home practice is helpful in making this happen  Whose Line Is It Anyway?

teaching job questions i'm a recent graduate and i just received my first teaching job when i was on the job market i had hoped to receive a teaching job close to home however there were few jobs so i branched out and the job that i ended up getting has a twenty five minute commute each way now that it's mid august the school district that i had hoped to work for has posted a lot of positions why do big school districts wait until the last minute to hire teachers won't they get the teachers who are the least qualified and have been turned down the most what do you think about this practice i'm not planning on reneging on my contract it just makes me wish that i'd waited to accept the offer hey at least i have a job yep just like others said many people back out of contracts during the summer of course it's for various reasons got married found a better job parent kid got seriously ill etc it sucks but people do leave jobs like this at the last minute and really this might be standard for most teacher contracts but mine says i have up to before the new school year begins to resign without reprecussions i kind of have the same issue as you but i also have to take my child to his school as well and this year i have a newborn so she will need to be dropped off at daycare so really the school i work at is about miles from my house but i'll have to leave about an hour before i need to be there to get everyone to the right place hubby cannot help out because he goes in the complete opposite direction but ilsedog answer above mine makes a good point about living and working in different towns i've been trying for the last two years to get a job in the district i live in i may rethink that speaking of trying to get a job in the district i live in my town is growing so quickly that the district is opening a new elementary school each school year so jobs are certainly available and in mass quantities and yes they did call me last year about weeks into the school year hello if i quit the job i've already started to take their job then the job i quit will have my certification taken away making me not qualified for the other job and this was a job that had been posted since the march before obviously i was not their st choice that's ok the job i have is fantastic i just thought it would be nice to cut that hour commute down to about minutes in other words i'm right there with ya babe  No Child Left Behind Act Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Romania Education in Germany Graduate school Education in the United States SAT GED Software engineering Education in Portugal Social rule Canadian House of Commons Charter school Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Boston and Lowell Railroad Professor Poker jargon Avenue Q Unemployment Education reform Hogwarts subjects Current teachings of Prem Rawat Education Breastfeeding Pittsburgh Steelers Freeters Affirmative action Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Principal-agent problem Warren Buffett Air traffic controller Economics Pitaten Good Times Ernest Harmon Air Force Base Springfield Elementary School Past teachings of Prem Rawat Academia Labor theory of value Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Day care Efficiency wages Public education Time Out of Mind Education in France Contract Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Economic inequality Intelligent design movement Education in Australia Rabbi Education in Taiwan Escape from New York Wal-Mart Homeschooling High school IB Diploma Programme Make money fast Boston Public Unemployment benefit Troms__ I.L.

how can i teach conversational spanish i have experience tutoring in spanish but have never focused on conversational spanish what activities can i do what is the best way to teach my student to speak my advice to you would be to focus your class sessions on listening and watching movies first and then reading comprehension followed by speaking activities such as role play etc the reason behind this is the fact that people new to a language are always better at input than output also try a system called tprs google it and see how it works it is very easy and my students love it it's basically a lot of story telling that engages students and makes them part of the story tellers have fun  Second language acquisition Lisp programming language Past teachings of Prem Rawat Education in the People's Republic of China Language education GED Graduate school Multilingual Aikido Education in the United States Spanish language Extreme Programming The Princeton Review Storytelling Drama Novel Simplified Chinese character Enterprise content management Interactive fiction Speech synthesis Homeschooling Logo programming language Alexander Technique TOEFL Eskrima Scientology beliefs and practices SAT Operational amplifier Education in Romania German language Social rule Current teachings of Prem Rawat Esperanto as an international language Sociolinguistics Literacy Human sexual behavior Model United Nations Game programmer Theory of conduct Manual transmission Philosophy of language Computer-assisted language learning Debugging Martin Heidegger Computer Ludwig Wittgenstein A Course In Miracles Education in Germany College Education reform English language No Child Left Behind Act Cardcaptor Sakura Educational perennialism Time Out of Mind Computer-supported collaboration IB Diploma Programme Latin Martial art Blog Python programming language Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Experiential education Finnish language Chinese language Connectionism BASIC programming language Languages of Hong Kong Scheme programming language Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Chatterbot Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Mission (Christian) Polymorphism (computer science) Bilingual education John Cage Functional programming Reverse mathematics The Apprentice 2 Anarchism and society Hearing impairment Secondary education in Japan Copy protection Common Unix Printing System Mnemonic Beavis and Butt-head Suzuki method Hakuin Ekaku XML Mutually intelligible languages Joseph Soloveitchik Secondary education in France Ye Shengtao For Whom the Bell Tolls Jehovah's Witnesses Joke Aspect-oriented programming Franz Boas Anthropology Dialect

teachers coming to your house ok i have kids i just registered for school and was informed that the teacher must make a home visit wtf why all of the schools in my area are doing this now it is my home and i dont want them here i dont ask to go to there house and check up on them where is it said that this is ok i live in ky no i have nothing to hide but i see no reason for them to be at my house or anyone elses teachers should be in the classroom teaching thats it wow that is a bit funky i am a teacher and we do home visits but that is only for bad reasons unfortunately like a child getting in trouble all the time not performing at grade level being unclean all the time etc it is my guess that they are trying to be proactive in your child's education to meet the parents and kids before hand so that the first month of school starts off on a better note we are asked to make a phone call or to send out welcome postcards to our new students are these public schools if so they cannot keep your child from coming to school if you refuse a visit every child is entitled to a free public education and it would be illegal to refuse if so if they are private or religious you are out of luck they make their own rules period they can refuse to take your child if you don't comply if it is a public school and they insist you can talk to an educational lawyer or go straight to the superintendent of the school district i understand your issue and that it makes you uncomfortable however you must ask yourself if it will be worth all the hassle to fight them only you can make that decision i am sure they are doing this for a positive reason even if it is annoying they should at least be able to tell you why it might not be such a bad thing for your kids sake to meet their teacher beforehand it will ease some anxiety for sure and as a teacher i ask you to remember things like this are never the teachers fault we are told what they expect us to do and we have to do it or we risk fighting our own battles with very little support i hope this all works out for you in the end  Education in the United States No Child Left Behind Act Boston Public Pledge of Allegiance French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools School choice Intelligent design movement Charter school Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in Germany Education in Japan Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Teachers (film) Education Homeschooling Springfield Elementary School Theory of conduct Teacher Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Education in the People's Republic of China Establishment Clause of the First Amendment Public education Education in Hong Kong Kindergarten Separation of church and state Teach the Controversy Kitzmiller v.

what works when disciplining kids in the classroom these days i teach th grade and in today's educational system you are forbidden to use any of the tried and true disciplining methods of old i'm not talking about spanking here today there are regulations that prohibit the use if writing reading homework physical placement i e standing in a corner take away recess time and of course public humiliation my teacher used to make us write i will not blah blah blah on a piece of paper 'x' amount of times whenever we misbehaved and that worked for me but we can't do anything like that today i am not in favor of anything cruel and unusual but we are expected to instill a sense of respect and discipline in these students and it is becoming harder and harder to do so if all of our ammunition is taken away so i ask you parents siblings and hopefully teachers are you aware of any disciplinary methods that are effective in today's p c classrooms please suggest them if so i am in great need for my upcoming class my students do not receive recess as they are fourth graders they have pe each day and they get about minutes to run around and play during that time i can not take any time from that also maybe i should mention that i teach in virginia education standards are very strict here don't let behaviors happen in the first place i know this is easier said than done but there are things that you can do to keep behavior issues to a minimum do you constantly and consistently reward appropriate behavior i can't tell from your post but by rewarding appropriate behavior you will get more results do not allow any down time in your room students should always be busy with something have something to do when finished no one should have to ask you what to do next keep a file folder for each child with anchor activities as motivation to do the work provide some type of incentives homework pass minutes computer time or whatever this will instill that hard work and doing a bit extra pay off then of course there are those times when we have minutes of down time without warning waiting for the pe teacher of whatever try some activities that you can do on the spot questions i'm thinking of a number and so on i always keep a set of picture finds on hand they are from the highlights magazine for children this same company also sells books called math mania that are quick too i always thought centers were for young children however i have found that they are fantastic ways to keep older kids working independently and they find them enjoyable too one that i really like is a series called take it to your seat language arts math science and so on it is a bit of preparation in advance but once it is laminated it will last for years http www amazon com literacy centers take your seat dp keep transitions to a minimum i know that with specials classes lunch and so on this can be difficult but i mean the transitions that you can control math to reading and so on also call students individually when lining up to leave the room jenny is ready for pe please push your chair in and line up you may have to stop instruction minutes early but it works no one wants to be the last one seated one thing that i carried with me when i went from middle school to elementary is have the student call mom to confess what he she did this has a greater impact on the student than if you call or send a note home good luck with the new school year  Education in Japan GED Education in Romania No Child Left Behind Act Education in the People's Republic of China Education Graduate school Kindergarten Grade (education) Education in Taiwan CPU cache Hunter College High School Literacy Homeschooling Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Computer Primary education Theory of conduct Martial art Mathematics Unemployment Alexander Technique University of Massachusetts Amherst Stuyvesant High School Education in Portugal Intelligent design movement Hogwarts Japanese tea ceremony Second language acquisition A-level Columbine High School massacre Bristol Grammar School Teacher Miami-Dade County Public Schools Experiential education Charter school Hopkins School Teach the Controversy Craps Logic School bus Lynbrook High School Philosophy of education Marshall McLuhan Economic inequality Logo programming language Boston Public Education in Singapore Spanking Shaggy dog story Capitalism E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.

how many days for substitue teaching did you get called for those of you who substitute taught how many days out of the week did you get called how many schools were you signed up with i should also ask how many greades subjects were you available to teach i signed up at a elementary and middle school in my town for grades k and am wondering if i will get called enough it all depends on how good you are most schools districts have a preferred sub list of the people they will call first when a job is available if you can get a good enough reputation you'll get called more and more often it also helps if you say yes most of the time when you're called if you turn down more than one or two offers they'll call other people who they think are more likely to accept the job you may want to start by signing up with two districts and keep one as your preferred district that you'll say yes to every time you can and only agree to the other as something to fall back on once your reputation in your preferred district picks up remove yourself from the other district so you aren't stretched too thin  Education in Germany Education in the United States Propaedeutic value of Esperanto High school No Child Left Behind Act Graduate school Teacher Miami-Dade County Public Schools Education in the People's Republic of China Fairfax County Public Schools IB Diploma Programme Middle school Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Education in Singapore Social rule Secondary education in Japan Murdock-Portal Elementary School Education in Romania Pledge of Allegiance Education in Portugal Houston Independent School District Naperville, Illinois Boy Scouts of America Primary education Labour economics Pittsburgh Steelers Education in Australia Salt Lake City School District Circuit design Education in South Korea Alex Ferguson Wall Street Volleyball GED Cold Lake, Alberta Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin Culture of the United States Internet fraud Raleigh, North Carolina Single Transferable Vote Los Angeles Unified School District Plano Independent School District Hearing impairment New York Giants Public education Anarchism and society Spring Branch Independent School District Kender Grade (education) Education in Taiwan College and university rankings Freetown, Massachusetts Textile manufacturing Breastfeeding Dallas Independent School District Omaha Public Schools Civilization III IUPAC nomenclature Gelsenkirchen Japanese tea ceremony Royal Assent Lewisville Independent School District Mesquite Independent School District Springfield Elementary School Irish language Grand Forks, North Dakota Derry, New Hampshire Gymnasium (school) Grade School Confidential Spam (electronic) Des Moines Public Schools Master's degree Newcastle United F.C.

if i am looking into teaching highschool mathematics do i need to be a math major any other options it depends on where you live in the us because of the no child left behind act teachers must be considered proficient in their discipline which usually means majoring in the subject you are teaching there are exceptions however you can receive emergency certification in most inner cities and some rural areas that have a harder time recruiting teachers when this happens you still have to take courses or get another degree to ensure you are able to continue after a certain amount of time i think three years if you have previous teaching experience then you can often take a test to prove your knowledge and experience you need to look at the regulations for your school district  No Child Left Behind Act Education in the United States Graduate school Teacher Education in Romania Education in Hong Kong Education in Germany Education in the People's Republic of China High school Mathematics Danish Folkeskole Education Jaime Escalante Secondary education in France IB Diploma Programme A-level SAT GED Education in Scotland College admissions Education in Taiwan Nurse Education in Australia Education in France Education in Portugal Physician Gymnasium (Denmark) Public education Professor Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tai Chi Chuan Reiki Juris Doctor New York State Department of Education Second language acquisition Junior Certificate Education Education in South Korea Education in Malaysia Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Grade (education) Master's degree Standardized testing Medical school Stuyvesant High School Higher Preparatory Examination (HF) Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Glen Ridge, New Jersey Hogwarts subjects University of Maryland Baltimore County Scientific method Science Software engineering Aikido Statistics Secondary education in Japan Experiment Martial art Psychology English as an additional language Teaching English as a Foreign Language General Certificate of Secondary Education Contract Anti-racist mathematics Army Cadet Force Education in the Republic of Ireland City and Guilds of London Institute Homeschooling Appeal Past teachings of Prem Rawat Far Eastern University Alternative medicine School counselor __cole Polytechnique Education in Singapore Caulfield Grammar School Charter school Bilingual education Pilot certification in the United States Michel Foucault National Certificate of Educational Achievement Cornell University Electrical engineering Ayurveda Philosophy of mathematics Paralegal Advanced Placement Program Scientology beliefs and practices Annuity Tripartite System Association for Renaissance Martial Arts UCAS Postgraduate Certificate in Education Gifted Education Programme (Singapore) French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Game programmer Postmodernism New math Augustus De Morgan Escuela Nacional de Inteligencia Education in Sweden

art museum and art teachers i need help okay so i need to create lesson plans math related which has to do with a museum school trip i'm not a teacher but this is for one of the prereq clasess for the credential program it's an art museum how can i possibly relate this to math help i was thinking maybe something abou tthe architecture or i dunno no clue o k so there are basically four directions you can take with this you can get the students to collect information about the trip themselves on the trip or things they saw on the trip and then graph it statistics you can help them to identify or record patterns of shapes sizes of shapes or colours within the architecture or artwork at the art museum patterns you could also use this information in your graphing you could have the students identify recreate through drawing or other means or measure those shapes sizes or distances between objects in the artwork or architecture within the museum geometry you can have them collect and use this information in their patterning and or statistics you could have the students record the information above using pictures numbers and words and calculate answers using addition subtraction multiplication or division to answers questions like how many are there or how much did you find in the numbers seeing that you're not a teacher yet i'd probably recommend choosing to do statistics and measuring activities as they are fun and don't require a huge amount of background knowledge to get started successfully with students google for lesson activities at the grade level s you need using keywords from the scenarios i've listed above look for activities that are easily moved outside of the classroom then take a trip to your museum to scope out what the possibilities are for this which artwork exhibits parts of the building are you going to have your students focus upon then plan the activity around what's available there remember to include in your plan what are the things you'll need to teach your students in the classroom before you take them on the field trip e g names of shapes how to graph using graphing paper etc also include what types of activities you might want them to do after they return from the field trip e g creating posters to show what they learned also plan for the students to work in partners on this activity in groups of supervised by a teacher teacher's assistant and or volunteering parent this helps to keep everyone on task and to not get lost hope that this helps  Mathematics No Child Left Behind Act GED Jumpstart 3rd Grade Education in Romania Extreme Programming Education in the United States Homeschooling Economics Dyslexia Experiential education Glossary of graph theory C plus plus Nurse Intelligent design movement Education SAT Princeton University Sudoku Statistics Graph theory Education in Portugal Teach the Controversy Pointer Librarian Massachusetts Institute of Technology M.C.

what to wear to teach english i am teaching for the first time this semester and i am wondering if i should be somewhat dressed up i'm thinking khakis and polo shirts to get the students respect or more causual jeans and t shirts to make them feel more at ease so that they would be more comfortable speaking up in class also the dress code is pretty well open on the subject i have seen professors dressed either way what do you think professional is always better the first week you can always get more causal as the time continues but as stated earlier your students don't care how you dress its more about how you feel how comfortable you are at teaching the more uncomfortable you are at it the more you want to present a professional manor  Bob Jones University St. John Ambulance Education in the United States Singapore Police Force Cowboy Shirt Brigham Young University White-collar worker Jesuit College Preparatory School Culture of the United States Modern Western square dance Graduate school Beavis and Butt-head Lawyer Education in Germany Negima School uniform Education in the People's Republic of China Uppsala University Okashina Okashi French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Model (art) Juris Doctor Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Experiential education Smith College Academic term Swimming pool Marilyn Monroe Hogwarts Sauna Hunter College High School Honey and Clover Cornell University Alexander Technique Education in Romania Japanese tea ceremony Teacher Skinhead Corset Paul Is Dead High school subcultures Aloha shirt Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Asperger syndrome Harrow School Washington State University Academia Raffles Institution Avenue Q Milton H.

does a license make a teacher does a teaching license make a teacher in other words regular classroom teachers are state certified right i believe that passing state exams does not make a person a teacher or any other professional your reply in california teachers are indeed state certified even substitute teachers have to go through several steps to achieve an emergency teaching permit the first being to take and pass the cbest unfortunately the cbest is not very difficult to pass and therefore does not effectively ensure that our teachers are of the highest intelligence it merely ensures that they have basic math reading comprehension and essay skills beyond that the system also requires fees to be paid for licenses credentials and permits and for applicants to pass a tb skin test passing a state exam makes someone no more of a teacher than giving birth makes someone a parent yes these both may be considered jobs by dictionary definition however it is when an individual shows compassion pride determination and a love for their work students children etc that they truly earn the honor of being considered a teacher or parent though there may be a number of educators out there whose qualifications for teaching are questionable i must say that a majority of them belong where they are most often it is a person of great character who chooses to make a career of helping others sadly they are not regarded or commended highly enough for a job well done that's just my humble opinion thanks for letting me share  Teacher Education in Portugal Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Nurse Education in Romania Notary public Graduate school Grade (education) Education Paralegal Juris Doctor Education in Japan GED Lawyer Homeschooling Physician Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in Taiwan Architect Education in England New York State Department of Education SAT Education in Hong Kong Education in Malaysia Martial art Affirmative action Professor Test (student assessment) Charter school Second language acquisition A-level Education in Australia Standardized testing Literacy Education in Scotland Jaime Escalante Baccalaur__at Certified Public Accountant Certification Attorney at Law A Course In Miracles Aikido Password Secondary education in France Creation and evolution in public education Software engineering Public domain Taxation in the United States Tripartite System Law school Alexander Technique Stuyvesant High School Rabbi City and Guilds of London Institute Unemployment benefit IB Diploma Programme Amateur radio Public education Crossword Separation of church and state Dyslexia School counselor American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Scientology beliefs and practices Medical Assistant Gifted Economic inequality College admissions Intelligence quotient Education in South Korea Establishment Clause of the First Amendment Separation of church and state in the United States Teach the Controversy English as an additional language General practitioner Objectivist philosophy Asperger syndrome Fair use Appeal Great Teacher Onizuka Expert system United States House of Representatives Supreme Court of the United States Real estate broker Publicly funded medicine National Certificate of Educational Achievement Scholarship Quizbowl John Howard Yoder Education reform

substitute teacher why are subsitute teachers considered less than teachers in terms of teaching ability why are subs not respected as professional how do i know i am a nyc sub its the same way in oklahoma i think they may be treated that way here because you only need a year degree instead of a year to be a sub dont know how it is there though another reason i think is because they think of you as temporary and so many dont bother to see you as anything but a fill in for the day in oklahoma subs only get paid dollars a day thats why i quit  Teacher Alexander Technique Professor English as an additional language Domination & submission (BDSM) Graduate school Reiki Education in Portugal Teaching English as a Foreign Language The Price Is Right Secondary education in France Academia Education in the United States Software engineering City and Guilds of London Institute Polyamory University of Central Oklahoma Avenue Q Academic degree College Scopes Trial Teachers (film) University of Oklahoma Relative clause Education in Japan Education Supply and demand Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Submarine Education in the People's Republic of China Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME World Championship Wrestling Coercion Quiznos Sub Fertility awareness Theravada John Peel Annuity Education in Germany Urinary incontinence Postgraduate Certificate in Education Rabbi Mental retardation No Child Left Behind Act Church of Christ James Garner Tai Chi Chuan Medieval university John Lindsay Article One of the United States Constitution Doctorate Apprenticeship Japanese tea ceremony C.

will technology replace human teachers in classroom in the twenty years to come now more and more education can be delivered via internet which means the need for teachers is not as intensive as past so will it be possible that the amount of teachers needed will be less than before i see this as a possibility at the secondary and college levels i don't think teachers will ever be replaced but there could be a need for fewer teachers at these levels technology would enable students to learn from the best in the field and one teacher could deliver information to hundreds of students however that one teacher or a computer cannot possibly be there to answer questions for those hundreds of students when they don't understand something in addition consider that computer learning only works for people who are committed to logging on and doing the work that requires motivation and dedication that is beyond the grasp of nearly all elementary and middle school students and beyond many struggling high school or college students in these cases particulary at the elementary level teachers do so much more than just deliver factual information which is all that computers can do being in a classroom in an elementary school also involves learning life skills and social skills that need to be learned through experience and adult guidance no computer will ever be able to do that  Education in the People's Republic of China Education Education in the United States No Child Left Behind Act Primary education Literacy Experiential education College Homeschooling Asperger syndrome Grade (education) Education in Germany Scientology beliefs and practices Education in Portugal Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Cooperative education Miami-Dade County Public Schools High school Education in Taiwan Dyslexia Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Middle school Montessori method Danish Folkeskole Education Seneca College Graduate school Education in Austria SAT Motivation Education reform GED Secondary education in the United States Education in Singapore Columbine High School massacre Education in Albania Murdock-Portal Elementary School Martial art Bridgewater State College Education in Australia Medical school Houston Independent School District National Certificate of Educational Achievement Education in India Software engineering Education in Hong Kong Charter school Waldorf Education Caulfield Grammar School Past teachings of Prem Rawat Classical education King George V School Stuyvesant High School Medicine Charles William Eliot Computer Kindergarten Current teachings of Prem Rawat Tutor Ateneo de Manila University Lynbrook High School Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Alexander Technique Cryptanalysis Secondary education in France Melbourne High School Test (student assessment) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Simulation University of Massachusetts Amherst Second language acquisition Simplified Chinese character Model United Nations Culture of the United States Catechism Brown v.

can anyone point me in the direction of some interesting books on art and education i'm currently really interested in the possible merits of using art as an educational tool a book that i've been rediscovering recently for use in my classroom planning is art and illustration for the classroom by rhian brynjolson through peguis publishers the isbn number is this book is full of ideas for art production both technical exercises and projects you can take a jump right in approach by looking at the many samples of students work and their captions for ideas as well as just reading in longer blocks for explanations of how to teach the concepts i m currently working on correlating lists of mini lesson and project ideas from this book with a series of arts driven unit themes i m using in the upcoming year topics such as composition repetition volume etc if you would like for me to send you a copy when i finish send me your email address by the way for visual awareness and art appreciation i use a website with my kids called the artist s toolkit it is created and maintained by the minneapolis institute of arts it can be found at http www artsconnected org toolkit though i teach elementary school age kids this site would be appropriate for teaching at any age level the toolkit section has a watch find and create process that i use to make sure that my kids fully understand the concepts that i am presenting them with i use this as well as the encyclopedia section for my kids to practice apply pencil sketch techniques to reproduce sections of the related art work for ideas and reminders i have them paste them into notebooks we refer to as our ideas journals we use these lessons as jumping off points for the other class art projects that we do for art appreciation i also use a series of books by mike venezia called getting to know the world's greatest artists they are aimed more at early years students but when i encountered them i found i learned things about art and artists that i didn t know they are put out through childrens press he also has put out a series called getting to know the world's greatest musicians hope that some of this helps  Tai Chi Chuan Software engineering Open access Scientology beliefs and practices Ajax (programming) A Course In Miracles Comics Second language acquisition Yearbook Extreme Programming Object-oriented programming Music Art Intelligent design movement Homeschooling Computer X Window System Teach the Controversy Francis Crick GED The Origin of Species Experiential education Education in the United States Marshall McLuhan Current teachings of Prem Rawat E-mail Psychology Richard Feynman Fair use Aesthetic Realism Open source culture Design pattern (computer science) Literacy Mathematics Arthur Cayley World Wide Web Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Beavis and Butt-head Modern dance Logic Ayurveda Photography Copyright Futures Studies Master's degree M.C.

is the possession of teacher's edition workbooks pohibited by the ministry of education i happen to ordered a set of teacher's edition wb so that it can aid me while i do my h w is that illegal the local publishers refused to sell them to me so i had to order it off the net what should i do many publishers or teacher manuals and keys simply will not sell to private addresses some will since there is a growing home school market those who purchase these to self correct cause the market to shrink somewhat ebay stopped selling these materials for the same reason and it is a shame that some teachers must work harder to supply their small private schools with materials due to this common occurance with students may i encourage you please consider what your goals are in obtaining these tes learning should be the optimum goal and joy of your education and not perfect grades checking and correcting your work with the same book your teacher uses will give you excellent grades albeit under questionable moral ethics but will it give you the goal of learning i truly doubt it if i may use the analogy of a door you are knocking down the door to obtain good marks from your teacher you will soon forget what it took to knock down that door you may even get into trouble for the damage done should you be caught your actions cause tougher locks to be installed which hurt some teachers' attempts to truly teach their students when you learn how to find answers on your own you will have the key that will unlock many of the doors you can't knock down learn to love to learn and seek that with all your heart learn to research and think and you will find that the answers on the other side of the door often come with only a slight push instead of a hard kick some answers will be harder but you will have the key that is the better key and that will unlock doors you never thought would budge i hope you consider this sharon who took over nineteen years to learn to love to learn for the mere sake of learning and is now teaching that to other children  A Course In Miracles Education in the People's Republic of China Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Intelligent design movement Martial art Education Jumpstart 3rd Grade Scientology beliefs and practices Education in the United States Current teachings of Prem Rawat Homeschooling Education in Japan Socrates SAT Tai Chi Chuan Education in Romania GED Philosophy of education Boston Public Church of Christ, Scientist Microeconomics Tenshinhan Confucianism Past teachings of Prem Rawat Coercion Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Standardized testing Theory of conduct Textbook McGuffey Readers Columbine High School massacre Alexander Technique Liberalism Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Education in Germany Copy protection Economics Nicomachean Ethics Academia Strategic management Water polo Teacher Graduate school Ludwig Wittgenstein Gifted Public-key cryptography Confucius Teach the Controversy One Tree Hill (TV series) Aikido Japanese tea ceremony Blood (computer game) Code: Lyoko Capital accumulation Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Muslim ibn Aqeel Plame affair Education in Portugal Charter school Floppy disk Francis Crick Free will Gramophone record Middle school Windows XP Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Pitaten No Child Left Behind Act Sin City The Hobbit Human Education in India Experiential education National Certificate of Educational Achievement Philosophy Lawrence v.

is making the crap money that teachers get worth having the summer off summer's off i've been teaching for years and making about a year during the last summers i've been going to graduate school to finish a master's degree so not exactly time off normally i spend the summers researching material for the next year i start making lesson plans revise my curriculum rewrite tests quizzes etc i use the time to take advantage of training opportunities and professional development some teachers choose to use the summers to write or work on projects others spend time with their families some travel many get jobs or fellowships there are plenty who go back to school to further their education get ahead of the trends learn something new etc others still have hobbies they enjoy dedicating some time to developing teaching isn't something most people go into for the money we become teachers because we have a genuine desire to work with students we want to help future be the best they can and achieve their dreams it's an incorrect idea that those who can do and those who can't teach it is instead those who can teach sorry i got a little side tracked and jumped on my soap box i'm a little passionate about what i do and why i do it  Education in the United States Graduate school Teacher Homeschooling Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Germany Education Education in Portugal Physician Education in Hong Kong College Master's degree Standardized testing Education in Japan Hogwarts subjects Columbia University Quizbowl Alexander Technique Lyceum of the Philippines Waldorf Education Software engineering Librarian Experiential education Education in Australia Juris Doctor Medical school Education in the Republic of Ireland Caulfield Grammar School Academia Education in Taiwan Great Teacher Onizuka University of Chicago Teach the Controversy Doctor of Philosophy Reiki Welcome Back, Kotter Education in Austria Indian Institutes of Management Education in Romania Professor Robert Hutchins Nurse Law school PLATO Education in France American University Propaedeutic value of Esperanto SAT Tai Chi Chuan Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Higher education Software testing Bah__'__ Faith and Education Medicine Danish Folkeskole Education Avenue Q Open University (Netherlands) Chinese University of Hong Kong NHH Genseiryu Physical therapy Center for Science and Culture A-level School counselor Teaching English as a Foreign Language The College of New Jersey Rabbi Charter school Education reform Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism Tianjin University Space colonization Zen U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School Bologna process Eagle Claw Education in Albania Athabasca University Friends Jacob's Pillow Jiddu Krishnamurti Secondary education in Japan Jewish studies Cooperative education Cornell University Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology National Certificate of Educational Achievement Gifted Education Programme (Singapore) Anti-intellectualism Dice __cole Polytechnique Stevens Institute of Technology Secondary education in France Dog agility Franklin W.

can teachers make a lot of money i really want to become a teacher but i also want to be filthy rich unfortunately the answer is a resounding no you can only get by with a teacher's salary and that is to say you dont intend to live in an extravagant way with being a teacher it's all about the passion to teach passion for the students yes the rewards can be personally fruitful and forevery meaningful however this passion wont buy you an expensive car a house in a well known community or those name brand watches so if you really wana be filthy rich then do something else perhaps you'd be lucky enough to be a teacher to fullfill your passion then have a sideline business or make good investments to make you rich  Gross domestic product Tuition Poker jargon Anarchism and capitalism Catechism Minister of religion Capital accumulation Current teachings of Prem Rawat Mutual fund Graduate school Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Education in the People's Republic of China Great Depression Investment bank Aesthetic Realism Outsourcing Education Personal rapid transit Past teachings of Prem Rawat Contract Education in the United States Personal finance Guru-shishya tradition Rich Mullins A Course In Miracles Socrates Leviathan (book) Great Teacher Onizuka Ubykh language PLATO Love PE ratio Textbook Flat tax Sola fide Salary Atomic Kitten African American Vernacular English Education in Germany Bottom (television) Life insurance Make money fast Teacher Microeconomics Soul FairTax Inflation Warren Buffett Azumanga Daioh Filthy Rich: Cattle Drive Divine grace Wealth condensation Sunk cost Irish dance Wheel of Fortune Donald Trump Insurance Stock Progressive tax St. Joseph's College, Hong Kong Capitalism Wario Guru Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints National Kidney Foundation Singapore Socratic method Chicago Bulls Social rule Wealth Schabir Shaik Trial Franklin W.

first day of school activities i am looking for activities for the st day of school to do with th graders creative projects thanks i like to read the kissing hand on the first day it's a lower elementary book but it discusses feelings about the first day this can lead to writing activities about what your students felt on the first day how did they feel what made them feel that way did those feelings go away if so what made them go away if not what can the teacher class do to make that child more at ease you could also turn it into an interview by pairing groups of students up to answer the same questions good luck  Education in the United States Kindergarten Experiential education Primary education No Child Left Behind Act Brown v.

would you say that learning the abc's is different from learning other preschool skills i'm a teacher and i've been thinking a lot about learning in the preschool years it seems when children learn to walk talk use a spoon explore how flowers look and feel etc it is all motivated by their natural curiosity about what they are seeing in the world around them but when it comes to learning their letters or numbers although they may still be curious about these symbols we place in front of them it seems that this is the first time that they are learning simply because it is necessary and not because they are mimicing or exploring what do you think i don't think of any of these as 'preschool skills' they are all 'life skills' if we didn't know these basic skills it would probably be difficult to function on a day to day basis however learning comes from curiosity we are curious about how things work we are curious about political ideas we are curious about the next step in things etc since we are curious about all of this we naturally learn from it there is an exception to this in my opinion there are some things that we are forced to learn like algebra we aren't really curious about it when our th grade math teacher tells us about it it isn't something that most teens have a natural curiosity about however some of that curiosity does kick in when we are looking for the answer we are curious sometimes as to whether we got the right answer or not we are curious what will happen when we complete the list of instructions that accompanies the lab our science teacher gives us we are curious in language arts how the novel ends that we are forced to read and we are curious as to what our classmates thought of it during the discussion at age students may not admit that but it is happening  Education in the United States Asperger syndrome Education in Taiwan Dyslexia Mathematics Theory of conduct Kindergarten GED Kender Motivation Homeschooling Education in the People's Republic of China Education Richard Feynman JumpStart Education in Romania Philosophical skepticism Plame affair Milton H.

why science for year old kids why not you introduce them to science what it is how it works you can give an over view of some of the more widely known branches starting with medicine and doctors and how they use devices and substances to check your state of heatlh you can talk about chemistry and show them litmus paper and how it changes color testing for acids and bases litmus paper and a lemon or some vinegar you can show how acids and bases react such as the vinegar and baking soda experiment you can talk about astronomy and if you're up with it you can tell them a few things about what's out at night such as right how jupiter bright and high in the south right after dark and how it's planet and not a star you can also explain that science goes hand in hand with arithemetic and numbers that will help stimulate an interest in math for some students there are probably some nice introductory videos from time life that can be shown you can get a dual thermometer set up and put a wet paper or cloth over one bulb and leave the other alone and spin this on a handle then take the temperature readings the wet bulb is diffeerent from the dry bulb if you subtract the numbers you can use to chart to show the humidity or amount of mosture in the air this can be a math demonstration using large number such as from is and from seven is zero so it's an degree different and you can find on a chart what this means in humidy again it shows how arithmetic and science work together  Carbon dioxide Mathematics Mnemonic Experiment Acetic acid Mercury (element) Battery (electricity) Acid Incandescent light bulb Light-emitting diode Vinegar Lighting Alum Vitamin C Sulfuric acid Science Francis Crick Electrophysiology Water (molecule) Education in the United States PH Graduate school William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sun Cold fusion Chocolate Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Hydrochloric acid Strap-on dildo CPU cache Technetium Air conditioning Physical science Garlic Henri Poincar__ Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Geber Amateur astronomy Onion Physics Linus Pauling Traditional Chinese medicine Scientific method Laser Glass Invisible ink Hydrogen Urinary incontinence Sulfur Ultraviolet Opportunity rover Explosive material CPU design Dairy Robert B.

what to do with a bossy student i start teaching next week in a very small school i know many of the kids already from having been a student teacher and substitute and know there is one student who is very bossy she is bossy to everybody not just the teachers i see her get shunned because of this and i am not too sympathetic to her plight because i know the bossiness has caused the shunning does anyone have any good ideas on how to deal with bossiness i feel she would be a great leader if i could channel her energy in a positive direction any help would be great appreciated school starts tuesday august young girls are often bossy because their role model is their mum who tells everyone in the house what to do perhaps what you've really identified is her frustration that others don't see things in the same way that she does and so she feels compelled to put them straight girls often mature quicker than boys and are therefore more likely to take control of situations unfortunately when the others in the class begin to catch up there is a difficult period of adjustment for all concerned my advice is to concentrate on developing their intellect and intelligence and be content to support their emotional and social development without trying to form them into something of your own making  About a Boy Maison Ikkoku The Catcher in the Rye Intelligent design movement Education Transactional analysis Stuttering Boston Public Infantilism Hogwarts Shreveport, Louisiana Pitaten Hikikomori Motivation Teacher Education in Japan Drama French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Graduate school Moral Politics Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Aikido Beavis and Butt-head Teach the Controversy Adolescence Asperger syndrome Okashina Okashi Friedrich Schleiermacher Milton H.

other than elementary school is there anything else you can teach with a ba in liberal studies concentrationin social science i know you would need a teaching certificate but aside from that in most states that comply with no child left behind it is doubtful that you would be able to teach language arts english science or math on the level if your liberal studies degree constitutes history requirements then you could teach social studies ultimately the question is this do you have at least college courses that are devoted to one of the core subjects la science math ss if the answer is no then you are probably unable to teach public school  Education in the United States Education in Romania Education in Singapore Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Junior Certificate SAT New York State Department of Education Education in Hong Kong High school Advanced Placement Program No Child Left Behind Act College Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Education in Germany A-level Teacher Homeschooling Gymnasium (Denmark) Chinese University of Hong Kong Education in Australia Doctorate Secondary education in the United States Mathematics Education in the Republic of Ireland Education in Sweden GED Education in France Harrow School Community college University of Maryland Baltimore County Clements High School Harvard Division of Continuing Education General Certificate of Secondary Education Education in South Korea Bah__'__ Faith and Education Education in Japan Public education City and Guilds of London Institute Trinity College, Dublin Intelligent design movement Physician UCAS Hunter College High School Smith College Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics Church of Christ, Scientist Bachelor of Arts Education Ateneo de Manila University Secondary education in Japan Juris Doctor Statistics Oregon State University University of Cambridge Johns Hopkins University Western philosophy Georgetown University Education in Scotland Grand Valley State University Turkish education system Stuyvesant High School Sonoma State University Medical school University of Alabama Institute for Christian Studies Cooper Union Higher School Certificate University of Victoria Quizbowl Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Belmont Abbey College York University Scientology beliefs and practices Academia Philosophy of mathematics Education in Austria Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Emerson College Glen Ridge, New Jersey Physics Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination Savannah College of Art and Design Australian National University Science Secondary education in France Associate's degree Education in Malaysia Open University Pennsylvania State University Multilingual University of California, San Diego Ball State University Jewish studies The College of New Jersey

do you need a bachelor degree to teach basic accounting i have associate of science degree in accounting and have been working years in the accounting clerk level i am wondering if further studies beside certification are needed to teach basic accounting possibly in high school check with your state education department they may have a program for professionals to switch careers however regardless of the state i am certain you at least have to have a bachelor's degree preferably in your field of interest you will also most likely be required to take some education classes to hone your skills if you are good at math you might want to consider that all schools are in desperate need of math teachers see if there is a tapp program in your area you have to have a bachelor's degree for this though you can start teaching right away get paid and take education classes in the summer but the subject field has to be critical like math science english etc  Education in the United States Teacher Graduate school No Child Left Behind Act Master's degree Education in Hong Kong Education in Germany Education in Portugal Education in Australia Community college Paralegal Lawyer Juris Doctor Law school Medical school City and Guilds of London Institute College Academic degree Education in Taiwan Chinese University of Hong Kong Physician Education in the People's Republic of China Nurse Education Librarian Education in Sweden Education in Japan Junior Certificate Bachelor of Arts Florida Institute of Technology Electrical engineering Education in France Doctorate Australian Qualifications Framework Georgetown University SAT Education in Austria Education in Finland Architect The College of New Jersey Far Eastern University Oregon State University High school Education in India Secondary education in France Gymnasium (Denmark) Stuyvesant High School Software engineering Master of Laws University of Phoenix Professor General Certificate of Secondary Education College admissions Associate's degree Emerson College Athabasca University Academia Doctor of Philosophy University of Houston Ball State University Education in Malaysia Education in Canada University of Maryland Baltimore County Propaedeutic value of Esperanto A-level Education in South Korea Caulfield Grammar School Advanced Placement Program Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Cornell University Jaime Escalante Open University (Netherlands) Kwantlen University College IB Diploma Programme Secondary education in the United States Secondary education in Japan Education in Singapore Accountancy Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Clements High School Memorial University of Newfoundland Civil engineering Northeastern University, Boston Cooper Union Trinity College, Dublin Colegio de San Juan de Letran Physical therapy GED Apprenticeship Mathematics Public education United States Air Force Academy

which would you prefer teaching elementary school or older kids is a liberal studies degree the best degree to get for elementary teaching also is it harder for male elementary teachers to get hired thanks for any inputs i definitely prefer teaching older kids middle and high school it is so hard to teach anything with elementary kids especially the younger ones because they are always interrupting to tattle or because they have to go to the bathroom i even put a no tattle policy in my classroom that then made them cry because i wouldn't listen to the tattling i love teaching older kids though they have great ideas and when they are not afraid to express them some great class discussions unfold liberal studies will do fine if you wish to teach older students in private or parochial schools some states expect you to have a teaching license therefore a teaching degree in order to teach in public schools personally i think that teaching licenses are a waste of time you are either a born teacher or you are not many elementary schools hire male teachers in fact it may be easier to get a job because the schools are so anxious to show gender equality in their faculties  Education in Japan Education in Germany Teacher Education in the People's Republic of China Primary education Professor Homeschooling Education in Taiwan Springfield Elementary School Secondary education in Japan No Child Left Behind Act Columbia University Graduate school Propaedeutic value of Esperanto College Education in Portugal The College of New Jersey Separation of church and state French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Charter school Murdock-Portal Elementary School Yearbook Master's degree Bart chalkboard gags Education in South Korea High school Experiential education Christian Brothers University Brown v.

advice for a new first grade teacher i am fresh out of texas a m and ready to start my first year teaching in just two short weeks i will be teaching first grade which i do not have much experience with i'm hoping to get some good advice for the first couple of weeks of school and especially the first day any ideas for parent communication classroom organization activities classroom management etc will be greatly appreciated i'm starting my fourth year with st graders the beginning of the year is hard with them because they are still fresh out of kindergarten and really can't work too independently on a lot of things yet getting out homework and tearing out workbook pages will seem like such a chore at first be patient of course with practice they get better toward the end of the year you'll actually get a little bored waiting for someone to ask for help because they grow and mature so much during that year and they'll be much more independent so keep that in mind when you start to get frustrated weekly or bi weekly newsletters are great when communicatiing with parents i hate phone calls with parents so this seems to do the trick you may or may not want to give out your home email address i did my first year and luckily i wasn't bothered at home too much but i haven't any other year because i want school related issues to stay in school anyway parents love the newsletters and it helps them know what's coming up so they and their kids can be prepared always post homework buy a magnetic dry erase board and put it in front of the kids i abbreviate a lot of it so they can write it down too and it doesn't take an hour to do it like practice book pages and would be pb they understand it after a few short weeks put pencil sharpeners in your room and make sure they sharpen at least every morning they'll want to get up and blow their nose all the time so make sure you tell them unless there is snot running down their faces in better words of course hehe they are not allowed up when you are in the middle of teaching make sure though they know that if it is an emergency they can just quietly get up and do it or else you'll have can i get a kleenex questions interrupting the class it's distracting and st graders get distracted easily keep desks away from windows and doors if possible for the same reason i just mentioned give them jobs they love it messenger pencil patrol empties pencil sharpeners book patrol calendar plant patrol line leaders etc add it as part of their morning routines give new jobs every week put up lots of colors in your classroom keep plants in the room go on quick drink breaks once in a while have them get up after long mornings and do stretches with them play quiet music during private reading time play classical music while they're working when you say something to them go through with it whether it's a punishment or a reward they remember things and this can be a bad thing johnny i'm going to talk to your mother about your behavior then you don't do it and he sees he got away with it never never email parents about problems with their children call or meet face to face always first talk about the good qualities of their children stay organized it's so much easier to know where everything is take advice from your colleagues if they give you stuff and they will take it store it away for later if you don't need it right away they want to help i still get things from them create a cozy reading area i have a cozy book nook in my room that i reward quiet readers with it's for serious readers only and they know it read to them once in a while my st graders love the judy blume fudge series always have sponge activities for those minutes or so between classes activities when you don't have time to start a new lesson these can be as simple as drilling math facts playing a spelling review game but you can google a ton of these i live by them always have back up plans because nothing will ever run as smoothly as you hope laugh with them when it is appropriate but don't let it get out of hand if something silly happens don't get mad giggle it off then move on be an actress they love enthusiasm use voices gestures etc to get them interested and most importantly respect them and they will respect you  Shaggy dog story Kodocha Dog training Little Britain Education in the United States Great Teacher Onizuka Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Extreme Programming Theory of conduct The Catcher in the Rye Calvin and Hobbes Avenue Q The Adventures of Pete & Pete Pitaten A Course In Miracles Spidey Super Stories Time Out of Mind Milton H.

i do not like some things going on in education i am a substitute teacher i am called upon to teach various subjects but if i am called upon to teach about sexual relations i refuse to teach that homosexuality is natural and not a lifestyle choice i refuse to teach that it is an acceptable alternative to heterosexuality i refuse to do that to our children i love to teach but political correctness is making it harder and harder neniaf wrong these are children whatever we teach them is instilled in them shapes their future their choices in life i refuse to be a part of the liberal agenda i will not teach that such behavior is natural however thank you for your input i believe what the asker is talking about is curriculum that tells children who are too young to debate it and reason it out that homosexuality is one or the other quite frankly i don't want my son being taught about sexual orientation in school that's my job and i talk openly with him about it it's one thing to teach that families come in all shapes and sizes and to teach that we all have to make our decisions in life it's another to stand in front of a class and teach mandated curriculum that just plain tells them this is ok it goes a lot deeper than that and while i may not agree with some people's choices it's not the school's job to override me in teaching him moral values it's also not the school's job to override me in discussing this openly with my son for the school to tell him what he should believe i'm his mother it's my and my husband's job to discuss and reason that through with him honestly my advice to you is to stick to your guns there is absolutely nothing wrong with teaching according to your convictions and refusing to teach classes that go against those convictions there may be times that you are under fire for that the bible even says you will be because apparently freedom of speech of action and of thought applies to everyone except for christians everyone else can be adamant in what they think and even call others intolerant for not seeing things just like they do but when christians stand by their convictions it's called being small minded and intolerant funny that even if you come under fire for it your actions will cause others to think and they might just effect change in the end you are responsible for what you teach and not just to the school board you are responsible to the kids and parents teaching is important but what you teach is even more important don't bend on your core beliefs hope that helps  Teach the Controversy Sexual orientation Homosexuality and Christianity Homophobia Intelligent design movement Theory of conduct Infantilism Separation of church and state Education in Japan Theodicy Democracy Church of Christ Evil Sexual abstinence Religion and sexual orientation Social justice Polyamory Ex-gay Original sin Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Abortion debate Determinism Laura Schlessinger Transsexuality Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Liberalism Christian right Wedge strategy The nature of God in Western theology Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith Feminism Confucius Free will A Course In Miracles Homosexuality and Judaism Creationism Religion and sexuality Ethics Moral Politics Homosexuality Coercion Domestic violence Jehovah's Witnesses Gender role Bah__'__ Faith and Education Education reform Center for Science and Culture French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economics Homeschooling Boston Public 2004 Republican National Convention Aesthetic Realism Political correctness Zoophilia Objectivist philosophy Religious Society of Friends Human nature Predestination Rick Santorum Philosophy Gay rights Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Criticism of libertarianism Cultural relativism Creation and evolution in public education Biology and sexual orientation Heteronormativity Bisexuality Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Plame affair Summa Theologiae Goodness and value theory Same-sex marriage in Canada Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social psychology Family First Party Hate speech Education in Germany Choice and sexual orientation Reparative therapy Education in the People's Republic of China Excommunication Freedom of speech Supply and demand Microeconomics Franz Boas The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex

how can teachers help their students on the first day of school many children are nervous and anxious how can we help them succeed thank you i'm not sure what grade you teach but most students just expect their teachers to be fair and provide them with guidelines regardless of age start out by introducing yourself and explain that you expect positive results from them and are there to help them succeed but not do all of the work for them then next tell them specifically what your course will attempt to teach them and then explain to them in a positive way what you expect from them and what they can expect from you then move into what they are going to learn from your course and the ways that is accomplished including class etiquette and participation respecting their peers and you as the instructor positive learning environment and other aspects like that then you need to stress that everyone learns at different levels and you will do your best to accomodate the different personalities in your class but you must stress that no question related to your subject matter is considered stupid or dumb and that anyone who does not understand the material should be comfortable to ask you without feeling silly or made fun of this is why the what's expected of each other part is so important after that just kind of sit back a little and interact with them and let them interact with each other for a little bit then you will have a better idea of how to handle your specific classroom dynamic from the atmosphere they establish you will also have the opportunity to observe how they relate to each other by listening to them and watching their behavior when they first arrive for class and sit down then later in the class session after introducing yourself and the guidelines ask them if they have any questions of you about the course and you should be able to have a better idea of how things going also you want to make sure that you let them know that you will answer their questions but only if they address you in a polite way be acknowledging hands in order to get your attention and not just shouting out things first and talking over their classmates when someone else is speaking you should be able to present this information without seeming like a tyrant or authoritarian and i'm sure you will do fine just remember it is the role of the teacher to teach provide useful information provide structure give guidance and encouragement when necessary command respect and preserve authority without stating such and being contradictory hypocritical to setting a good example obviously you modify your introduction and instructions to make this age appropriate but i'm sure you will do fine just remember that you can't satisfy every student but most of childern students are usually good kids and are not looking to encounter problems it's the parents that are often times more of the problem or the cause of potential problems so communication with everyone is key however i don't think you should discuss school policies specifically because then that puts the emphasis on the school having authority over you and even though we know this is true you don't want to emphasis that because that diminishes the key role you play as the authority figure to them it's just like in business you never encourage employees to appeal to upper management until they have tried direct communication with their immedicate boss supervisor again communication is key and also establishing guidelines without ever referring to them as such and without directly saying you are in charge because for some reason those terms seem to make students tense  Scientology beliefs and practices Education in the People's Republic of China Past teachings of Prem Rawat Second language acquisition Education in the United States Intelligent design movement A Course In Miracles Education Social psychology Economics Alexander Technique Education in Japan Current teachings of Prem Rawat Philosophy of language Homeschooling Theory of conduct Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ethics Fair use Logic Transactional analysis Strategic management GED Aikido Catechism Milton H.

teachers what do you see as th e biggest challenge s in education today why what will be the effects as an elementary teacher i find that my biggest challenge is that the parents of my students don't seem to take much interest in how their kids are doing we get a lot of lip service they say they will help but they don't even look in their kids backpacks to see if there are notes from the teacher or homework we all work and we're all tired when we come home but that doesn't mean you ignore your child i agree with posters above too money for supplies too much technology and little meaningful learning teachers in our time seem to be expected to teach manners and morals also ethics because parents don't do it it is certainly scary that one day these people will be in charge of our government  Education in the People's Republic of China Teacher Theory of conduct Bart chalkboard gags Education Education in India Tuition Homeschooling Education in Japan No Child Left Behind Act Great Teacher Onizuka Education in the United States Catechism Primary education Homework Shaggy dog story Pledge of Allegiance Charter school Gifted Socrates School choice Tai Chi Chuan Current teachings of Prem Rawat Asperger syndrome Kindergarten Education in Germany Education in South Korea Daria Education in Romania Saved by the Bell The Giver Teachers (film) The Fairly OddParents Ocean's Twelve Education in England Ludwig Wittgenstein __mile Durkheim Grade (education) Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Brown v.

what is the nqt i am graduated from the faculty of commerce accounting dept so i was not really qualified as a teacher but i worked for years in an international school as a ta now i travelled to doha and will start my new job as a teacher for y my tas friends all started doing the montessori to be more qualified i heard of the nqt but i really don't understand is it a certificate that i can take on line like the montessori or is it something i had to study in uk at college and which is better for me to study first the montessori or the nqt if i can study it on line sorry if my question sounds silly but i really need an answer thank you hiya as already said nqt stands for 'newly qualified teacher' after studying to become a teacher in other words after doing a degree course or other access course the teacher is in their first year of teaching and is called a nqt or newly qualified teacher during this first year the teacher will undergo further training receive support from the school and will be assessed after the first year of teaching the teacher will be assessed to see if they meet teaching standards if they do they continue teaching into their second year i hope this makes sense so nqt isn't a course it is the term given to a teacher in their first year of teaching you also mentioned montessori montessori is an alternative education system which operates outside of the governed state education systems montessori is normally pre school education to teach in another education system e g steiner montessori it is common to have to go additional training to understand their philosophy of education and their teaching methods doing a certificate in montessori education will only benefit those wanting to work in montessori schools it doesn't really make you more qualified just allows you to work in their schools the certificate wouldn't be recognised in other education systems so montessori is an education system nqt is the first year that teachers go through after completing the degree course i'll just like to make it clear that by undertaking a montessori course that diploma will only allow you teach in their schools not all schools i don't know where in the world you are based so you will have to think what education system you want to work in state private independent i hope this of help to you  Teacher Education in Hong Kong Education Education in Germany Montessori method Education in Australia Physician College Medical school No Child Left Behind Act City and Guilds of London Institute Education in the People's Republic of China Academic degree Graduate school High school Postgraduate Certificate in Education IB Diploma Programme Education in Japan General practitioner Philosophy of education Education in the Republic of Ireland Education in Romania Doctor of Philosophy A-level Community college Australian Qualifications Framework Education in the United States College admissions Juris Doctor Apprenticeship Tai Chi Chuan Master's degree Chinese University of Hong Kong Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Nurse National Certificate of Educational Achievement Education in Singapore Law school Intelligent design movement Charter school Homeschooling New York State Department of Education SAT UCAS Standardized testing Waldorf Education Paralegal Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Education in Sweden Education in Malaysia Literacy Barrister GED Maria Montessori Lawyer Rabbi Intelligent design School counselor Associate's degree Academia Distance education Professor Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination Ludwig Wittgenstein Lyceum of the Philippines Trinity College, Dublin Rudolf Steiner Medical College Calcutta Tripartite System Higher Commercial Examination Programme Education reform Philosophical skepticism Bah__'__ Faith and Education Physical therapy Education in the Netherlands Reiki Gymnasium (Denmark) University of Szeged Seneca College King City, Ontario Victorian Certificate of Education Software engineering Public education General Certificate of Secondary Education Past teachings of Prem Rawat Anglo-Chinese School Martial art Institute for Christian Studies Columbia University Secondary education in Japan

question for teachers in grad school or who already have their grad degree i am going into my th year of teaching and i need to take classes to renew my teaching license i want to start graduate school and work towards something rather than take any class just to fulfill the requirement the problem is i'm not sure what program to take i love being in the classroom now but in years i might want to move on to something else i am considering a curriculum program or maybe a reading specialist but i am still very unsure any suggestions or experience would be appreciated by the way i am a first grade teacher now i did the same as you are considering i simply went for a basic curriculum and instruction masters i was lucky enough to find a program where the profs were excellent i keep in touch with a couple of them to this day i too may want to switch it up a while from now but my thinking was i dont want to do a program that i will not use immediately in years the information will be old your degree certainly still valid but why not wait until you are closer and take classes then so my plan is if i decide to do something different i join another program good luck  Teacher Education in the United States No Child Left Behind Act Education in the People's Republic of China Professor Education Education in Japan Homeschooling Education in Portugal Education in Germany Master's degree Medical school Education in France Secondary education in Japan __cole Polytechnique Education in Romania Glen Ridge, New Jersey Nurse Education in Sweden Intelligent design movement Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Education in Taiwan Physician Tripartite System Juris Doctor Education reform Emerson College Standardized testing Bellarmine College Preparatory Academia Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Massachusetts Institute of Technology Charles William Eliot College Lyceum of the Philippines Teach the Controversy Bologna process Librarian Secondary education in France IB Diploma Programme New York State Department of Education High school Columbia University University of Pennsylvania Law School Education in Malaysia Middle school GED Community High School, Ann Arbor, Michigan Education in Australia Shreveport, Louisiana Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism Physical therapy Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Grade (education) Education in Finland U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School Waldorf Education Asperger syndrome Rabbi Danish Folkeskole Education Doctor of Philosophy Education in the Republic of Ireland Gwinnett University Center Franklin W.

what are the essential qualities of an ideal maths teacher make math real this is why you need to know this then make learning it real using real life situations where you might need this skill try to keep it simple and test kids often just to assess the skill they are learning it doesn't have to be for a grade just for your information then you will know if you're teaching them correctly if they don't get the basic stuff they won't get the higher level information either so check often my biggest pet peeve don't give them homework problems to do big waste of time give them five or ten and expect them to be done correctly  Education in Romania Grade (education) SAT Test (student assessment) Education in the United States No Child Left Behind Act Education Dyslexia Homeschooling Education in the People's Republic of China Debugging Education in Japan Martial art Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Computer numbering formats The Book of Five Rings Richard Feynman Japanese tea ceremony Education in Hong Kong Literacy Code: Lyoko Aikido Mathematics education Learning Asperger syndrome Mathematics Education in Portugal Kim Possible Scientology beliefs and practices Theodore Kaczynski Theory of conduct Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Prostate cancer Electrophysiology Music lesson Graduate school Gifted Paragliding Education in Taiwan Alexander Technique Master's degree Tai Chi Chuan Blackjack Information Technology Infrastructure Library Arthur (TV series) ELO rating system Domain Name System Standardized testing Assessment Digital circuit Charter school Pitaten W.

what would be possible innovatory ways of teaching physics to day teaching physics has become a real challange how to teach physics interestingly is very important this depends on how well we use avilable resources effectively your english is terrible ways to teach physics well use real scenarios do a bunch of roller coaster problems for kinematics and then go to cedar point and take data doing the math and problems can be tasking for some kids so make it fun two ways to do that are to make problems violent and gruesome darts being thrown at puppies or to use whiteboards in classes for some reason students love doing problems on white boards instead of paper and pencil you can make whiteboards using tile board or marker board from home depot lowes it's about for sq feet then just cut it into squares x good lab equipment can help if you can do lab experiments to verify equations and also to verify realities friction error measurement precision it can make a problem real to a student any form of creativity i had th graders make treasure maps for displacement and distance differences use nearby universities they allow high schoolers to go on tours of the labs have you ever seen a piece of polystyrene attached to a dna strand and then controlled by a laser or have you seen a quantum computer the kids will like it and they won't learn how a quantum computer works even though they try very hard to explain it but they will hear things that they recognize and they can see applications of stuff that they know  Mathematics Quantum mechanics Determinism Physics Scientific method Gravity Richard Feynman Geodesy Laser Quantum computer Floppy disk String theory Interactive whiteboard Renormalization Normal distribution Aikido Central processing unit Tide EPR paradox Explosive material Quantum chromodynamics Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Dynamical system History of science Homeschooling Transformer W.

how can a teacher best give a sense of security to a student in his or her classroom i think a sense of security comes from having a disciplined and structured classroom if the students all know the rules and the teacher is consistent that allows the student to always know what to expect if you allow poor behavior sometimes and crack down at other times it causes stress and confusion as well as resentment both by the student who didn't get away with it as well as the one who did when each student feels respected and held to the same high standard they can have self respect and feel secure in their environment that's my view  School discipline Education in Japan Experiential education Graduate school Tai Chi Chuan Adult attention-deficit disorder Poker jargon Classroom Alexander Technique A Course In Miracles Education in the United States Secondary education in Japan Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Teacher Separation of church and state Kindergarten Grade (education) Theory of conduct Daria Boston Public Dyslexia Florida Institute of Technology Second language acquisition Narcissism Education in Taiwan Asperger syndrome Infantilism Cognitive science Columbia University Columbine High School massacre Wah Yan College, Hong Kong Martial art Teach the Controversy Philosophy of education Past teachings of Prem Rawat No Child Left Behind Act Alignment (role-playing games) Academia Education in Germany Social psychology National Religious Party Hunter College High School Ultimate (sport) Creation and evolution in public education Homeschooling Beavis and Butt-head Alfred Korzybski Test (student assessment) Appeal Community High School, Ann Arbor, Michigan Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hikikomori Education in the People's Republic of China Visual Basic Lynbrook High School PLATO School French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Worldwide green parties Intelligent design movement Raffles Institution Jehovah's Witnesses Karen Horney Montessori method A.

is it better to begin a teaching career with your bachelor's degree or with your master's degree i know that schools look for experienced teachers therefore those with higher degrees will look more promising when applying to better school districts but i also know that teachers with master's degrees are paid more upon entry schools might be more apt to hire those with a bachelor's degree so that they do not have to pay a new teacher as much if they had a master's degree i'm on the fence i don't know whether or not to start teaching with my bachelor's degree one in history and one in psychology and then going to get my master's degree later or to get my master's degree now and then start looking for teaching jobs help those trying to give the best advice will recommend that you get your masters before job hunting in most states you will need that master's degree or its equivalent very soon after you start teaching in most states you can only get temporary teaching certification without a master's degree or equivalent that means working and taking course work at night if available and or going to summer school with all the year round schools now working on a master's degree during the summer is not always an option the new no child left behind law that require districts to have highly qualified teachers is another reason that you may find it easier to get a job with your master's degree in hand if you are financially able go ahead and get your master's degree after you do your student teaching or internship additional hours beyond your bachelors will not adversely impact your ability to find a job as reality checks i am a recently retired teacher i taught for years i have a master's degree and additional graduate hours getting a job teaching history in high school or junior high will be easier if you are qualified to coach a sport since you have a background in psychology you might want to consider a master's degree in counseling  Education in Germany Education in the United States Teacher Lawyer Education in Australia Professor Master's degree No Child Left Behind Act Education in the People's Republic of China Medical school Education in Japan Chinese University of Hong Kong College Education in the Republic of Ireland Law school School counselor Academic degree Academia Education in Portugal Physician College admissions Barrister Apprenticeship Paralegal University of Houston Community college Memorial University of Newfoundland Education in Hong Kong Doctorate Tai Chi Chuan Education in Romania High school Postgraduate Certificate in Education Associate's degree Athabasca University Unemployment Alexander Technique Education in Sweden Nurse The College of New Jersey Scientology beliefs and practices Rabbi Librarian Degrees of Oxford University Architect General practitioner Kwantlen University College Ball State University Social work Bologna process Christian Brothers University City and Guilds of London Institute Oregon State University Education in France Fencing Software engineering Education in Canada SAT Georgetown University Education in Finland Columbia University Reiki Far Eastern University Education in Malaysia Martial art Pennsylvania State University Hogwarts subjects GED University of Chicago Bachelor of Arts Intelligence quotient Trinity College, Dublin Education Doctor of Philosophy Bachelor of Laws Sam Houston State University Public education A-level Indiana State University Education in Singapore Education in Taiwan American University Diving Pharmacist Secondary education in Japan Master of Laws Education in Scotland Franklin W.

have ever just not gone to a workshop you signed up for if it's a free workshop not required during the summer and the workshop is full is it a big deal if you just don't go have you ever just not shown up just because it is free to the teacher doesn't mean your district or school isn't paying per person if you cancel enough in advance you might save your school money i know when i give workshops the cancellation deadline is week notice other wise the school will be paying for that persons spot unless they fill it with someone else it is not fair to the school nor the presenter to not give notice but understandably i too have ducked out of a few pointless workshops in my day not my own of course that would be really bad business practice lol have a good workshop or cough cough sick day before school starts up again  Professor Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

why do schools favor the primary parent divorce especially those earning more income don't they teachers staff and administrators realize how difficult this is for the student in the u s many students come from dual or two family households the secondary parent does not like to be treated unfairly and out of the loop and the child does not like witnessing this joint shared custody the secondary parent lives in different city due to job the child goes back and forth between two households even if there is actual custody as opposed to say physical and legal schools often have a records system that holds one primary address when a mailing has to go out someone clicks a mouse and a printer spits out one address label per student it's best to have whichever parent is in the school records as primary address this schools get lots and lots of angry phone calls from non custodial parents trying to do an end run around their custody decrees so if the custodial parent of record makes the request to have your child's record flagged for double mailings it will carry more weight and frankly if a high school child is upset to witness this the high school child should say something to the teachers i have more than once witnessed a child who says to teachers you only need to notify the one parent my other one has nothing to do with me and then turns to the upset other parent and says gosh mom dad i don't know why they're doing this it sure makes me upset too  Fathers' rights Divorce One Tree Hill (TV series) Pledge of Allegiance Domain Name System Kodocha Education in the People's Republic of China School choice Polyamory CPU cache Friends Motion picture rating system Education in Germany Education in the United States Visitation Charmed Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education Primary education Boston Public Education in Portugal Waldorf Education Interstate Highway High school Secondary education in France Fathers' rights movement in the UK Plame affair United States Postal Service Hikikomori Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Tai Chi Chuan Status of religious freedom in Sudan No Child Left Behind Act Culture of the United States Education in Japan Mach kernel Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Intelligence quotient Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Alberto Gonzales Charter school Barack Obama Terri Schiavo Mouse (computing) Education in England 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Shaggy dog story SAT Education in Singapore Grade (education) Education in Hong Kong Appeal Section 28 Children of God Rent (musical) Private school Israeli Arab Social Security (United States) AppleTalk John Edwards My Parents are Aliens George W.

online college i got to university of pheonix i was just wondering would an employer be less likely to hire me because i went to school online i really think online college is more hard because you have to teach yourself alot unfortunately i have to attend school online because of work i am in college to become a school teacher i went for my bachelor's at a traditional school then landed my teaching position after i had been teaching for a while i went to get my masters and took those courses online through walden university online courses really aren't too bad you get to 'attend' class when you have the time and teaching yourself the material isn't too difficult it just requires a lot of reading on your part which would happen at a traditional college too talk to some area school districts and see what they say if they don't like to hire teachers that receive their degree online you may have to consider a traditional college in order to get a job or start your coursework online then transfer to a traditional school your senior year so that you have a degree from that 'traditional' school good luck  Graduate school Education in the United States Teacher Education in Australia Master's degree Education in Germany Bachelor of Arts Juris Doctor Community college College Education in Portugal Professor High school No Child Left Behind Act Medical school Education in Hong Kong Associate's degree Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the Republic of Ireland Open University Education Trinity College, Dublin Education in Sweden Tai Chi Chuan Australian Qualifications Framework Chiropractic Academia Education in France Grade (education) Lawyer Distance education Athabasca University Columbia University Doctorate University of Maryland University College Education in Malaysia Cooper Union California Polytechnic State University Law school Doctor of Philosophy Education in Canada Bologna process Education in Taiwan Student University of Central Florida Master of Engineering City and Guilds of London Institute Teaching English as a Foreign Language Institute for Christian Studies Degrees of Oxford University Education in Japan Christian Brothers University Robert Hutchins College admissions The College of New Jersey Physician Theory of conduct Jaime Escalante Washington University in St. Louis Affirmative action GED Savannah College of Art and Design University of North Texas Eton College The Sims 2: University Japanese tea ceremony Architect Hogwarts subjects Western Kentucky University Education in Finland Education in Romania A-level Reiki Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Academic degree Social rule University of Toronto Experiential education Medieval university Georgetown University Air Education and Training Command University of Houston Pennsylvania State University Secondary education in France German language Textbook Franklin W.

do i have to have a theme in my classroom i am a first year teacher and do not have money to go all out and set my room up with a theme is this okay should i spend my savings on classroom decoration i work in a very low income community so we barely have supplies as it is i've already spent hundreds on things like calendars books etc absolutely not i think some teachers get entirely too caught up in bulletin boards and themes it's fun to do but it's not necessary for learning to take place since you don't have a lot of money to put towards it and your students are low income you should all work together to create decorations let the kids set up committees and decide what they want to do and how they'll go about doing it it'll be cheaper less work for you outside of class and a creative learning experience for your students  Beavis and Butt-head The Catcher in the Rye Columbine High School massacre Classroom Education in Germany Teacher Murdock-Portal Elementary School No Child Left Behind Act Glen Ridge, New Jersey Education in the United States Great Teacher Onizuka Daria King George V School Japanese tea ceremony Experiential education Community High School, Ann Arbor, Michigan Raffles Institution Ohio Wesleyan University Bristol Grammar School Drama Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Giver JET Programme Kindergarten Bart chalkboard gags Boston Public Hogwarts Floor Directory Massachusetts Institute of Technology Teach the Controversy Graduate school Education in France Avenue Q Education in India House of Lords Education in Japan Caulfield Grammar School Erik Satie Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur The Adventures of Pete & Pete Harrow School Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix St. Joseph's College, Hong Kong Salt Lake Community College Homeschooling Progressive tax Teachers (film) Gwinnett University Center Education in Portugal Worcester Polytechnic Institute Robert Hutchins Steller Secondary School Lynbrook High School FairTax Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy The Apprentice 2 School violence Education in Hong Kong Education in the People's Republic of China Paradox Emerson College Model United Nations Melbourne High School Lesson The Citadel (Military College) Tai Chi Chuan James Ruse Agricultural High School Carey Baptist Grammar School Learning disability The Emancipation of Mimi John Cage Franklin W.

violent kids in class in my class there are two boys who seem to believe that violence is the only way to react to any situation the other day these two notorious boys fought in class boy a slapped boy b which caused boy b to punch boy a this is just one instance of their violent behaviour what do you suggest i do to make them more calm and rational and not instinctively punch someone i agree that you should take the situation to the school psychologist or counselor you can try whole class activities like role playing somehow incorporate life skills into the classroom if you have time it depends on the ages too you could have the students watch videos play with puppets read stories about anger management and violent tendancies i know that in some districts it is difficult to get additional help so have you tried talking to each of the boys to see what is going on there is obvisously an underlying reason try being their friend try your best to relate to their issues try to find out their interests and maybe fit in a lesson around that focus their attention on their interests instead of their worries even though they are children they still feel the pressures of life they just don't know how to focus it good luck with this one  Domestic violence Hikikomori Aikido Boston Public Martial art Second language acquisition Social rule Empathy Transactional analysis Milton H.

september classroom idea what do you think this is my first year teaching th grade here in cali we don t have the usual seasons so instead of decorating my class in fall stuff for back to school i was thinking of doing a by the sea or underwater theme we are on the coast and our history for the year is about california so i was going to decorate my class and do some boards with a fish or beach or water theme is that a good idea or do you have any suggestions i think in october and november i will do the fall season stuff what do you think i think it's a great idea you could even make the name tags in the shape of the gray whale which is california's state marine mammal it would be great to start teaching them little facts about ca in the first day you could even do an ice breaker game like a scavenger hunt hide facts around the room and have the children say eureka i have found it when they find a fact state motto they will read it to the class introducing themselves their fact as well as giving them a chance to explore their area they will be able to get comfortable in their beautifully decorated classroom good luck sorry i got carried away back to your idea i love it  Gray Whale Orca Whale Japanese tea ceremony Sperm Whale Dolphin Blue Whale Albatross Ecco the Dolphin United States Coast Guard Wheel of Fortune Whaling Fauna of Australia The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Education in Germany USS Whale (SS-239) Marine biology Japanese calendar Seabird Shark Pilot Whale Hunting 1997 Pacific hurricane season Hopkins School Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Drama Education in Japan Cetacea Atlantic Ocean Second Battle of the Atlantic Neopets USS Narwhal (SS-167) USS Sands (DD-243) Kitzmiller v.

should i reply to an e mail from my tutor at uni i had a little chat with my tutor about my english problem on friday and just received an e mail from him and the e mail is about his suggestion to get advice from the course coordinator and that's it should i reply it i felt a bit disappointed cos i thought he could help me and i feel that he doesnt really care about me sad oh no i didnt think of the relationship thing at all omg he's like yrs older than me m i sounds like i like him i just want ppl care about me i know uni is different from high skool but i used to stick with the teachers at university tutor pupil relationships are always more adult the reason he probably didn't answer you is because tutors often don't think that it is their responsibility to help out their students in this way they see it as your advisors job and would rather you asked someone else you see they don't have any vested interest don't worry about responding to the e mail you should send a simple one back saying thanks for your advice don't worry not all tutors are like this some actually want to help their students although from experience english departments are always the worst for support don't let this put you off asking for help again in fact from experience i found that the students who were persistent were the ones who the tutors liked most just don't be overly persistent be friendly and maintain a professional adult relationship show that you are willing to be friendly but see them on a level and remember that you pay fees for those guy's help it is not their duty but if they are nice enough and have the time they should be able to help you out just remember don't expect them to go through the work with you but do expect them to give you any tips on books that you could read that might help clarify the problem for you or websites that would help if the problem is academic suggest this when you e mail him  Social rule Graduate school Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Plame affair Theory of conduct GED Monarchy in Canada Infantilism Little Britain Education in the People's Republic of China Current teachings of Prem Rawat Adult attention-deficit disorder Humphrey Bogart Neopets Education in the United States One Tree Hill (TV series) Thomas Hobbes Sydney Riot of 1879 College Internet troll Milton H.

what are the most important things to keep in mond when tutoring a young child i start tutoring a young child about the age of english language today and its my first time it will be a second language for her i was wondering if anyone has any advice or some guidlines i could follow i meant in mind hehe i've worked with kids ages and swear by the following rules dont ever forget that a child is a child first don't put adult pressures and expectations on them children learn best when they are having fun it just means you have got to spend a little more time in preparation making your lessons interesting and your method of teaching i call it sharing knowledge creative and at times unconventional children are restless by nature and get bored easily its okay if they dont want to sit for too long or want to talk about something else i found that doing a few activities and lessons in the garden or incorporating a little trip to a place that could tie in with the theme for the day was a huge learning experience for the child they just love learning through songs story telling and word play i taught them basic words and phrases in spanish chinese italian by playing corners adding a new set of words to the corners every other day above all let them perceive you as being a friend and a fun one at that and that's half your battles won good luck and enjoy yourself  Social rule Avenue Q Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Philosophy of language Kender About a Boy Education Numerology Relative clause Storytelling Great Teacher Onizuka Philo Dictionary Extreme Programming Socrates Quotation mark Esperanto as an international language Singlish Faye Wong The Catcher in the Rye Hearing impairment Mnemonic Swami Vivekananda Theory of conduct Martial art Pinyin Cognitive science Charles Dickens The Jazz Singer English language Spanish verbs Time Out of Mind Hungarian language Novel Chinglish Meaning of life Japanese tea ceremony American Sign Language Craps Education in Hong Kong Charles Darwin's education Languages of Hong Kong Philosophy American and British English differences Suzuki method Pitaten Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Chinese language Spanish language Mojave people Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Korean language Drama Second language acquisition Maison Ikkoku Bill Peet German language Blonde on Blonde Little Britain Gerund Opus Dei English grammar I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Ocean's Twelve Japanese language Mao (game) Current teachings of Prem Rawat Kodocha Ido Transactional analysis Non-native pronunciations of English The Amber Spyglass Contract bridge Religious Society of Friends Sesotho language Aikido Piccolo Junior Saga Max Stirner Sant Mat Teacher Endowment (Mormonism) Education reform Sant Thakar Singh Literacy Phonics Mathematics Love Avicenna Electrophysiology Richard Feynman God Emperor of Dune Language education Parkour Cultural relativism Spot the Dog Indian English

to all teacher pls help me it is really needs to evaluate my academic credentials before i teach here i came from philippines and i graduated as teacher there i want to continue my teaching here i went to community college and talked to one of the councilor and she said it needs to evaluate first all my credentials to acei how much that will cost for all of it it is really and how's the teaching here give me some idea or scope how's the teaching level here when you are going to teach is your specialty subject only you can teach or you can also teach some subject that they need just in case you applied to the school that your specialty subject is not available you've made a good start by going to a community college to have your credentials reviewed i'm not familiar with this process or how credentials from other countries are reviewed so i cannot help you with that what i can tell you is that a bachelor's degree and a teaching certificate are required for any teaching job in the us however there are some other options to you that you can still work with children either while your credentials are getting reviewed and or you are completing the necessary requirements to become a teacher often childcare facilities often do not require college degrees but the laws vary by state so you would need to check into this for your area childcare facilities take children typically from weeks of age to years of age of course the school age children would only be at the facility afterschool and during the summers and holidays so this may not be a full time job simply look up childcare or daycare in the phone book where you live and give them a call if you are interested personally i have been a childcare director and i liked having people from different countries working for me at one place i worked i had two employees from the philippines and two from india it was very cool another option is to be a teaching assistant for a public school these jobs have a variety of duties and responsibilities and you might even be able to help the school district out with some translating in a pinch i teach english as a second language in texas and i had a student from the philippines last year i could not communicate with his mother at all i don't know much tagalog and neither does any other teacher in my district luckily he had a cousin that was fluent so i could communicate with the family that way again simply contact your local school district to see if they even have assistant jobs available i know we do where i live and a lot of them as far as the rest of your question typically teachers teach all subject areas math reading science and social studies at the elementary level grades k but middle school and high school teachers grades teach one or two subjects  Graduate school Education in the United States Education in Germany High school No Child Left Behind Act Education in the People's Republic of China GED Education in Portugal College Education in Japan Education in Romania Master's degree Education in Australia Teacher Nurse Education in Hong Kong Professor Education in Taiwan Education in France Education Juris Doctor Grade (education) SAT Secondary education in France Librarian Homeschooling Physician Education in the Republic of Ireland Paralegal Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Multilingual College admissions Secondary education in the United States Rabbi Secondary education in Japan Education in Sweden Kindergarten IB Diploma Programme Doctor of Philosophy Law school Medical school Chinese University of Hong Kong City and Guilds of London Institute A-level Culture of the United States Columbia University Education in Singapore Franklin W.

does anyone have advice for a first year high school science teacher and what to expect kids will test you that's just how it is be yourself and be honest but let them know you are in charge but have their best interests at heart and will listen to them here are some things that may help you out day one and two should be spent clearly outlining your discipline policy classroom procedures and grading policy students need to know what you expect of them up front many teachers have asked the students to help in creating classroom rules and consequences as they are more likely to adhere to things they have a say in you would be surprised how the students cover things you would like to address make a list of items you feel are most important and add those to the list the students come up with keep your rules positive for example use appropriate language over don't cuss be firm but fair you are not a student's friend but their teacher and advocate be friendly and approachable but let them know you are not a buddy you will discipline when needed we are just like parents and as much as we would like to be the 'friend' we cannot be that all the time be consistant don't do things half of the time and do not threaten to do things you will not do kids want to know where the line is if it moves all the time you will find the kids will be unsure of how to behave do not embarass kids in front of their classmates what you may consider a harmless joke or comment may actually be very upsetting you can joke around at times but be aware of the personalities of your students individually and as a class most of all make the class interactive and fun hands on projects and activities keep kids engaged and are beneficial for a variety of learning styles  Theory of conduct Education in the United States Education in Japan Teach the Controversy Graduate school Experiential education Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban No Child Left Behind Act Intelligent design movement Homeschooling Education in Germany School discipline Current teachings of Prem Rawat GED Asperger syndrome Azumanga Daioh Murdock-Portal Elementary School Transactional analysis One Tree Hill (TV series) Social psychology Grade (education) Secondary education in Japan Education in Taiwan Lynbrook High School The Hidden Curriculum Philosophy of language Plame affair Boston Public Tai Chi Chuan Raffles Institution Software engineering Center for Science and Culture Education in the People's Republic of China Extreme Programming Past teachings of Prem Rawat Martial art Kindergarten Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Charter school Meditation Teacher Columbine High School massacre Education Milton H.

underpaid teachers is the government going to do anything about underpaid math science teachers who actually want to be there and put effort into grad school when is it going to become a massive problem and our intelligence level and successes in the classroom change all content area teachers put money and effort into grad school and i would argue that english is the most important subject because employers need employees who can communicate well i don't think the lack of science and math teachers will ever become a critical problem our society doesn't much value education and will not be willing to pay more to attract more teachers to the profession they would rather have less than highly qualified teachers than pay more in taxes most high schools only require years each of math and science if the states want to mandate more than that they're going to have to cough up the cash to pay for it  Graduate school Education in Japan Education in the United States No Child Left Behind Act Homeschooling Teacher Education in the People's Republic of China Public education Separation of church and state Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Mathematics Education in Romania Experiential education Intelligent design movement Affirmative action Life insurance Education Education in Germany Economics Intelligent design Rick Santorum Education in Taiwan New York State Department of Education Secondary education in Japan Creation science Stuyvesant High School Milton Friedman Asperger syndrome Grade (education) Tax Inflation Waldorf Education Academia Education in Portugal Education in Malaysia Capitalism The Skeptical Environmentalist Trade union African American Vernacular English Worcester Polytechnic Institute Economic inequality Education in South Korea Profession Canadian and American health care systems compared Reiki College Social Security (United States) Kitzmiller v.

how can i get along with teachers what would be considered appropriate and inappropriate personally and professionally as teachers are simply a variety of human beings there is no essential difference in how to get along with them compared with how to get along with others mutual respect and consideration top the list along with behavior that enhances rather than diminishes the teacher's leadership and authority in the class your question is framed very well because in asking how can i get along with teachers you are assuming the responsibility for positive outcomes a good thing though if anything it is even more important for a teacher to assume responsibility in achieving the same goal one good approach good for your own progress as a students and your own peace of mind is not to take negative input from a teacher too personally negative input doesn't just include the way papers are graded and it doesn't just include constructive criticism sometimes it is just plain negative mistaken wrong if your teacher is a human being not an angel in disguise or a teaching robot so in getting negative input whether constructive or not remember that your teacher is human and strive to be tolerant and forgiving the teacher after all must put the day's rudeness and misbehavior of students behind him at the end of the day and try to wipe the slate clean by roll call time tomorrow the way to control damage from even extremely inappropriately negative input that might come in the course of a school day is to focus the mind forcibly on the positive it works with bad test grades too not i just got per cent on the test i'm stupid i might as well give up but i got the majority per cent of the answers right so i'm not too dumb how can i turn the other per cent around not the teacher is a b with an itch for being sharp tongued and rude but what positives can i extract from this negative situation how can i turn it around how by changing my behavior can i change the teacher's responses toward me appropriate and inappropriate is also an intelligent concern as teacher and student are merely roles and appropriate is whatever positively enhances the role and inappropriate is whatever destroys the positive interaction that the role is designed to supply it is inappropriate to disobey or try to get around classroom rules and to behave in a way that undermines respect for the teacher as an instructor or a mentor it is inappropriate to show antagonism or disrespect by openly defying the teacher wearing a hat in class against the rules slumping in the chair having food and drink in the class smirking and continuing in misbehavior when it is pointed out it is appropriate to be friendly and to joke and laugh a little when it doesn't disrupt a lesson classroom routine and the teaching learning process but contrariwise one teacher and student wrote the book on inappropriateness when she wore his baseball cap in class in disregard of the rule that no one was to wear a cap in class and when she not only allowed him to break the rule against drinking soda in class but even took a swig from the bottle these actions created a bad impression excessive buddy buddy closeness between student and teacher does not enhance the class's respect for her in her role as a teacher either extreme open enmity or excessive intimacy with students cripples a teacher's effectiveness it is the teacher's responsibility to set the tone but this doesn't excuse a student's misbehavior appropriate is whatever works best for everybody concerned and inappropriate is the opposite breaking the rules and upsetting classroom routine is always inappropriate the above are just examples common sense is the best guide  Social rule Social psychology Theory of conduct Microeconomics Alexander Technique Second language acquisition Asperger syndrome Motivation Martial art Japanese tea ceremony Welding Internet troll Psychology Theodicy Transactional analysis Intelligent design movement Past teachings of Prem Rawat Scientology beliefs and practices Extreme Programming Philosophy of language Drama Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Economics Tai Chi Chuan Teach the Controversy Beavis and Butt-head Standardized testing Great Teacher Onizuka Aikido Goodness and value theory Homeschooling Pitaten Infantilism Dog training Ethics Aesthetic Realism Education in the United States Philosophy of education Consensus decision-making Columbine High School massacre Allergy Education in Japan Operational amplifier Education The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Graduate school Classroom Supply and demand No Child Left Behind Act Expert system Breastfeeding Evil Autism Hogwarts Singlish Capitalism Utilitarianism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Social justice Cognitive science Atheism Alignment (role-playing games) Separation of church and state Milton H.

middle school classroom guidelines or rules what are some of the guidelines you have for your class and what are the consequences for not abiding by them it really depends on where you are in your career and your style in the classroom i am just about to start my fifth year of teaching and everything has changed every year overall you need to set guidelines for everything regardless of where you are in your career since middle schoolers aren't capable of remembering simple things like how do i go get a tissue do i ask or do i just get up that was the biggest thing that i learned in my first year they need to be told how to do everything at least once as for rules it's really just the basics that we've always had in school if you have to pick one thing for all of the kids to pay attention to it's respect there are several ways to show respect and if the kids are focused on respecting one another you and themselves they won't cause you any huge problems as for consequences it can really be different for every student i do a lot of one on one conversations about behaviors if that fails with a student i get a bit more severe by using my school's hierarchy of discipline i will admit there are times when the consequences for one student are nothing like the consequences for another student based on whether or not i've had problems with the student in the past i'll never punish a student more strictly because of their behavior but i may punish a student less than the hierarchy prescribes simply because that isn't a normal behavior from that student my first year was a very tough year and there were several times when a student openly swore during class and received a detention or office referral based on the offense but there was a case of one of my star students lashing back at a classmate by yelling you're starting to f ing p me off she had never once caused me a problem that year and i was stunned to hear what she had said i called her out of the room and discussed it with her how her classmate had annoyed her and how her reaction was inappropriate for the classroom she was very apologetic and knew that her response was inappropriate rather than write an office referral like i'm sure that i had for another student that year i sent her to the guidance office for a few minutes to cool down before coming back to class she never gave me any more problems and i'm certain that this was handled as well as it could have been handled the bottom line for consequences is this set up a plan for how you are going to handle problems in the classroom and follow it based on the circumstances if it's a case of a kid that is usally a pain in the neck follow it strictly if it's a kid that doesn't give you hassle every day take it easy on the kid they'll appreciate it and respect you more in the long run my plan works like this st offense verbal correction nd offense conference outside with student rd offense time out of the room th offense call home th offense office referral just a note my state's wellness policy doesn't allow us to detain students during lunch time so detention isn't an option also sometimes that th offense is a great time to have the student call home and explain to his her parent what they did to warrant a call home it embarasses the hell out of them in front of their classmates and gets their parents nice and upset that they had to get a call during the middle of the day this is incredibly effective as usual extreme circumstances call for skipping a few steps in the hierarchy if a kid punches a kid or does something to injure another student they don't need four chances they're going to the office all in all it really comes down to you knowing your students and what will work for them i would suggest sticking to a plan of action rigidly for the first several weeks of school and then when you know which kids are repeat offenders and which aren't you'll know how to deal with them individually heck sometimes it just comes down to letting a kid know that he's acting like a yutz and he'll cut the proverbial crap  Theory of conduct Extreme Programming Milton H.

applied math i am in the process of creating a homework project for my students i want them to research a topic and present on it the topics have to do with how math has affected sailing in the past years i came up with the gps but am drawing blanks any ideas that you can throw out there would be appreciated thanks in advance first thing i would do is a google search for web quests about sailing i started to do them to send you some links but it all depends on what grade you are teaching if they are already out there why recreate the wheel if that doesn't work for you do some research on sailing and see what you find maybe that will generate some ideas for you when you mention sailing the first thing that comes to mind for me is pythagorean theorem that doesn't do anything with the history unless the sails have become bigger or smaller have they added more sails how does wind speed effect the sails you would probably need to factor in the area of the sails too honestly i do not know anything about sailing so i may be way off base here as a last resort i would choose something other than sailing if you have a difficult time finding the information odds are your students will too i suggest doing a search for web quests that are grade level appropriate you will be able to integrate technology into the lesson which the kids love my th graders complete web quests for me on a quarterly basis  Mathematics Graduate school Theory of conduct Education in Romania Grade (education) Extreme Programming Computer Education in the United States GED Technology Luminiferous aether Theodore Kaczynski History Halting problem Fermat's last theorem Economic inequality Microeconomics Second language acquisition World Wide Web Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Hunter College High School A-level Education in Portugal Economics Spacecraft propulsion Central processing unit Master's degree Solar variation Species W.

how to develope a sense of security in the classroom what are some techniques to be applied it is the job of the teacher to make sure everyone feels safe in your classroom emotionally and physically i make sure that all students are treated with respect in my room by myself and other students there are absolutely no put downs allowed i don't care if that's how they play in my room every question and idea is honored equally i make sure my students know that they can come to me about anything that makes them feel uncomfortable and i will do my best to mediate the situation the students also have to trust each other that means that they need to know their classmates so depending on others in various group settings helps to foster that the teacher ultimately has control over the classrooom environment the students only take over if the teacher doesn't set that environment from the beginning  Theory of conduct Ethics Experiential education Social rule Abortion debate Alexander Technique Drama Reiki Current teachings of Prem Rawat Classroom Grade (education) Philosophical skepticism Boston Public Tai Chi Chuan Epistemology Education in the United States Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Martial art Scientology beliefs and practices Social justice Aikido Graduate school Meaning The Giver Past teachings of Prem Rawat Second language acquisition Social psychology Special education Education in Germany The Citadel (Military College) God Emperor of Dune Philosophy of education Maison Ikkoku Reparative therapy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus PLATO F.

which is the best route to get into teaching pgce or bed can someone please tell me the advantages disadvantages of both ways thankyou in advance it depends on your circumstances you have to have a degree to do the pgce if you already have one this is probably the best route it's certainly the quickest route if you are just starting it could depend on how commited to teaching you are if you are really set on teaching as a career bed will be the best preparation because you spend three or four years developing your understanding of children and the craft of teaching if you think you might like to teach it might be better to do a non bed degree and then the pgce that way you have wider options if you find that teaching is not for you when you actually get into the classroom another point is where you might want to teach there is some validity in the previous respondent's comments about primary and secondary but i have employed and trained both bed and pgce teachers in primary if your interest is in teaching children and making a major contribution to their overall development you might be better suited to primary teaching where you spend a lot of time with a class or children covering most or all of the curriculum a bed course might be the better route for this if your interest is more in your subject and you want to share and extend that interest you might consider secondary having followed a degree in your favourite subject and then taken a pgce if your subject is maths or a science you have the bonus of the government paying off your student loan if you stay in teaching for a number of years  Teacher Postgraduate Certificate in Education Education in Germany No Child Left Behind Act Education in Japan Education in Portugal Education in Australia Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Romania Graduate school Waldorf Education Student loan Homeschooling UCAS Secondary education in Japan Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Danish Folkeskole Education Education in England High school Education in France Master's degree Secondary education in France Kingston University GED Hogwarts subjects Education in the Republic of Ireland Annuity Asperger syndrome 401(k) Junior Certificate Education in Scotland College Nurse Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Education in Singapore Software engineering A-level Education in Malaysia Public transport Alexander Technique Philosophy of education Comprehensive school Principal-agent problem Top-up fees Primary education Experiential education Androgen insensitivity syndrome Church of Christ, Scientist Education in India Second language acquisition Grade (education) Tai Chi Chuan Gifted Education Programme (Singapore) Juris Doctor Tripartite System Professor IB Diploma Programme Medical school Medicine Aikido Physician Intelligent design movement Kindergarten University of Pennsylvania Law School Jaime Escalante Secondary education in the United States Reiki Raffles Institution Standardized testing J.

can i become an elementary or middle school teacher with a b s in biology i have been married to my husband for about years and we're thinking about having children but the public school system our kids would have to attend does not have a very good record i've taught semesters of college level biology courses during graduate school with outstanding results and have organized many presentations about biology to elementary schools with great feedback also but it might have been because i brought animals with me please tell me what you know thanks this would be easier to accomplish in a state with a teacher shortage i teach in the state of florida and to combat a severe teacher shortage anyone with a four year degree can apply for a temporary educator's certificate if they are willing to take and pass a general knowledge education test this is called alternative certification the individuals then have three years to complete a beginning teacher program often paid for by the school district you are teaching in and take several additional tests and pass them many successful teachers have began their careers this way however it does require a commitment to starting a new career earning less salary and learning about the teaching profession through hard work and trainings i have taught for years and i did not begin my career this way but you are bringing an attribute to the profession that many others won't it would be wise of you to connect with principals and share some evidence of your work in biology especially helpful would be the elem presentations on biology hopefully you have some pictures or other documentation of your previous work with children the best thing about your particular timing is that nclb is moving toward including standardized science scores when deciding if individual schools have made ayp adequate yearly progress making somebody with your skills and background more desireable i hope this helps you consider teaching find your state's departement of education website to find information on transition to teaching or new teacher certification requirements  No Child Left Behind Act Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Teacher Graduate school Education in Germany Education in Portugal Education in Romania Education in Hong Kong High school Juris Doctor Education in the Republic of Ireland Medical school GED Education in Australia Education in Taiwan City and Guilds of London Institute Medicine Education in Sweden Education in Singapore Education in Japan Software engineering Grade (education) Education New York State Department of Education College admissions College Experiential education Professor Education in Scotland Public education University of Maryland Baltimore County Community college Far Eastern University Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Master's degree Stuyvesant High School Education in Austria General practitioner Charter school Homeschooling Propaedeutic value of Esperanto IB Diploma Programme American University Miami-Dade County Public Schools Alexander Technique Chinese University of Hong Kong A-level Law school Intelligent design movement Danish Folkeskole Education University of Central Florida Air Education and Training Command Lawyer Creation and evolution in public education Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education reform Gymnasium (Denmark) Tripartite System Tai Chi Chuan Doctor of Philosophy Teach the Controversy Education in Albania Reiki National Certificate of Educational Achievement The College of New Jersey University of Connecticut Cornell University UCAS Certification Education in India Biology Secondary education in Japan Rabbi Academia Apprenticeship Reliability engineering Florida State University Hunter College High School Texas A&M University-Texarkana Caulfield Grammar School Dr. Michael M.

how to write a professional yet practical dress code for elementary teachers i need help writing a dress code for teachers at an elementary school last year our dress code was pretty lax but the rules that were there were not enforced and toward the end of the year there were parent complaints that some of the teachers were not dressing professionally enough to suit them so the principal has now made a very rigid dress code and we teachers are not allowed to wear any capri pants no open toed shoes pants are supposed to be regular length and have inch of loose material around the thighs and buttocks shoes must be closed toe but not tennis shoes nothing sleeveless nothing see through i mean some of this stuff is self explanatory like who would really wear low cut tops or tight jeans to work with children but this is ridiculous we live in florida we teach year olds and we are expected to stand outside during mid day on the playground with no shade and supervise recess we are expected to get down on the kids' level in degree heat with long pants and closed shoes the kids are required to wear uniforms but those uniforms are short sleeved polo shirts and they have a choice of wearing the shirt with long pants shorts that are within inches of the knee or skorts for girls and the parents made the dress code for the kids we didn't we teachers are trying to convince the principal that we can wear capri pants and nice sandals and still look professional so my question really is how can the dress code be worded so that capri and gaucho type pants some of which are very professional can be included but outfits that are too casual are excluded i mean someone in a nice rayon sleeveless sundress looks much more professional than a person in a polo shirt and khaki pants but the dress code says we need to wear the latter not to mention it's very difficult to even find long pants and closed shoes here in south florida where it's hot pretty much year round help yeah and about the men the only two men on staff are the pe teahers and they are allowed to wear any shorts and t shirts they want and tennis shoes obviously the principal just asked them to use good judgement and not wear anything too short or too tight hmmm doesn't seem fair does it any teachers how is your dress code worded yes a union would be helpful but this is a charter school not a public school i would express to my principal that i spend a lot of time on the floor painting and doing other messy things to wear some of the clothes you mentioned yes its important to look nice but it is also important to be comfortable enough to do your job also if you look too uppity you can't really relate to some of your underprivledged students seems like a really dumb thing to worry about after all we have important issues to think about with our kids  Bob Jones University Social aspects of clothing Skirt and dress Suit (clothes) Shirt Jesuit College Preparatory School Irish dance Recess (TV series) School uniform Shorts Kimono Softball Singapore Police Force Japanese tea ceremony Culture of the United States Sento Trousers Jeans Sock Raffles Institution Little Britain Cowboy Volleyball Canadian Armed Forces SpongeBob SquarePants Beavis and Butt-head Teen Girl Squad Buttocks Aerial (dance move) Clothing Paul Is Dead The Warriors Strap-on dildo Basketball Marching band Codename: Kids Next Door Corset Pantyhose French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Recurring South Park characters Figure skating Doug High-heeled shoe Clown Humphrey Bogart Plastic Education in Japan Textile manufacturing Academic dress of Oxford University Education in the People's Republic of China The Fairly OddParents Diving suit Negima Diving Theory of conduct Nudity Great Teacher Onizuka Scrubs Child pornography Hijab Okashina Okashi Russian joke Customs and etiquette of Japan Fair use Hakama Marilyn Monroe Charter school Trailer Park Boys The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Mixed martial arts St. John Ambulance Jackass: The Movie Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Stairway No Child Left Behind Act Skinhead White-collar worker Education in the United States One Tree Hill (TV series) Drag racing Jewish services Hogwarts Eton College Teacher's Pet (Disney) Heavy metal fashion Empire Burlesque Stocking

what are some ways to improve teacher parent relations assuming you are a classroom teacher start the year off right make a no secrets atmosphere in your classroom try to make contact in some form with every parent from your class as often as possible send a weekly e mail with classroom news send notes home about the positive things johnny did invite parents in for an author's tea student presentations or to show off other student work and so on i send a postcard to each of my students about weeks before school starts letting them know what i have done over the summer and that i look forward to meeting them the first day of school eventually when you need to contact a parent about the terrible thing that johnny did you will have already built some rapport and shown the parents that you do care about johnny and that you are worried not nagging do you use data notebooks i do it is a ring binder for each student with test scores work samples student goals copies of progress reports report cards awards and so on that i send home periodically for parents to review this helps keep parents in the loop even if they are unable to come into the classroom also remember that many parents work during the day and would like to be a part of their child's educational process but can't always make time in the middle of the day to do so be flexible offer parents the option of coming in to chat first thing in the morning or in the evening in my district parent teacher conferences are scheduled in the middle of the week from which does not make it very appealing for working parents i have always offered meetings from a m to p m on conference days and the parents are always very greatful to have that option i guess the biggest word of advice is to put yourself in their shoes how would you like to be treated approached informed and so on  No Child Left Behind Act Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Germany Education in the United States Education in Romania Homeschooling Graduate school Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 School choice Columbine High School massacre Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Lynbrook High School Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Primary education Shaggy dog story Teach the Controversy Kindergarten Gmail Student loan Reiki Hogwarts subjects Education GED Call centre Community High School, Ann Arbor, Michigan Danish Folkeskole Education Boston Public Public-key cryptography Neopets Extreme Programming Intelligent design movement Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Japanese tea ceremony Education in Japan National Football League Melbourne High School Glenbrook North High School Password Prostate cancer 1957 World Series Philosophical skepticism SAT Contract Yearbook Floppy disk Pyramid (game show) Internet fraud Stopping e-mail abuse Volleyball Cornell University Second language acquisition Center for Science and Culture Kodocha James Ruse Agricultural High School Bristol Grammar School A Course In Miracles Montessori method Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Windows Vista School discipline Education in Hong Kong Tutor Independent school (UK) Secondary education in France Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Community emergency response team Customs and etiquette of Japan The Critic Winning Streak Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Pennsylvania State University Ludwig Wittgenstein PLATO Dick Cavett Software engineering School violence Infantilism Morse Code Daria Pledge of Allegiance Steller Secondary School Objective-C E-mail Boy Scouts of America Hearing impairment Laura Schlessinger Computer Hopkins School Psychological testing

have you ever felt this way to all teachers have you ever felt like teaching isn't as important as other profession like being a doctor i know our profession is important and without teachers there wouldn't be any doctors lawyers architects etc but next to a few careers friends have i sometimes feel that what i'm doing isn't all that spectacular don't misunderstand i love education and teaching i am proud to be a teacher but just am i crazy i blogged about this yep i'm a dork on my page a long time ago feel free to check it out if you've got time i don't think what we do is spectacular and to be honest i think most people fall into two categories when it comes to their opinions about us they either put us up on a much higher pedestal than deserved or they think we're all child molesting idiots i also think there really are some teachers who probably aren't making a difference and shouldn't be teachers however i still feel like what i do is important because i make it that way i have a passion for teaching and a passion for kids in general i try to make what i teach relevant to their lives and applicable to what they'll do in real life i see my job as a way for me to soapbox it and hope my students can look at the world through different perspectives i don't force my beliefs on them but i encourage them to explore alternatives and to question what's considered truth but i totally understand what you're saying most of the people i was friends with in high school have gone on to those spectacular careers you're talking about they make way more money than i do and they party like rock stars compared to me lol it's the career path i chose though so i'm not really concerned with how glamorous it is as long as i know what i'm doing is worthwhile and i get paid enough to take care of the bills then it's all good nice question  Theory of conduct Aesthetic Realism Education in the United States Education Rudolf Steiner A Course In Miracles Philosophical skepticism Graduate school Current teachings of Prem Rawat Religious Society of Friends Intelligent design movement Scientology beliefs and practices Jon Secada Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Education in Japan Education in the People's Republic of China Boston Public Social rule Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Education in Portugal Plame affair The Catcher in the Rye Socrates Homeschooling Jiddu Krishnamurti U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Philosophy John Howard Yoder Moral Politics The nature of God in Western theology Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Aikido African American Vernacular English Religion No Child Left Behind Act Opus Dei Juris Doctor Blog Professor Church of Christ, Scientist Infantilism Pedophilia Richard Feynman Alcoholics Anonymous Meaning of life Avenue Q Alexander Technique Cliff Richard Friends Shaggy dog story Theodicy Teacher Intelligent design Singlish Goodness and value theory Jumpstart 3rd Grade About a Boy The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy American Idiot David Hume Atheism School choice French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Epistemology Anthroposophy Sexual orientation Church of Christ Knots Landing Teach the Controversy Franz Boas Milton H.

why are the school systems in america making science teachers teach evolution evolution is a theory just like creation is they both have evidence that supports them but also have evidence that prove it's not true i believe in creation and most of the people that usually end up in my class do too and when the teacher tells us that it's a new lesson we always get into an argument about how it's not fair that we have to listen to this evolution bull do u think they should make teachers teach that subject or not teach it being that it's just an opinion and do u think it's fair that they're making students learn it when they don't want to one could argue that evolution is a religion because it is faith based like creation it can not be proven because science can not test it to say evolution is science is false unfortunatly it is presented as such and many people are made unware of it's many falicies neither creationism nor evolution should be taught in public schools since there is a seperation of church and state that many people like to spout about when you talk about creation being taught so too should evolution not be taught  Creation and evolution in public education Creation science Intelligent design movement Creationism Teach the Controversy Kitzmiller v.

how to handle the th grade students who are not disciplined and couldn't understand english well currently i'm teaching in a national plus school junior high school each class consists of students i have to say most of them are rich spoiled and lazy children since it's a national plus school i have to teach by using english but the fact is their english ability is way too low only few of them could follow the lesson well moreover they still do their 'elementary school'bad habits such as walking around during the lesson chatting interuppting when the t is explaining coming late not bringing the books not paying attention when someone's speaking can anyone give ideas how to cope this thing i need them to be able to follow the lesson well have some respect n discipline know the turn to speak and be silent and could sit still during the lesson i couldn't translate my explanation since english is the main language and my principal wants no billingual you may want to revert to elementary methods to try to curb elementary school behaviors use a marble jar and when it is filled have a pizza party put marbles in one each day everyone comes to class with books or on time or if everyone is quiet through the lesson be sure to tell them when lesson time so they know to be quiet alot of this could be language barrier but i would explain to them that listening to others including you is displaying common courtesy which you want to reward for more punative measures if people are goofing around make a dramatic walk to the chalkboard and slowly write tally marks until they are quiet for every tally marks they lose a minute of lunch recess and i'd explain the system that if they aren't quiet to teach the time has to be made up somewhere good luck to you you don't have an easy situation  Education in the United States Education in Japan Social rule Second language acquisition Shaggy dog story Philosophy of language Theory of conduct Literacy Education in Romania Logic Dog training Dyslexia Alexander Technique Columbine High School massacre Extreme Programming Secondary education in Japan Primary education Chinese language Education in South Korea Martial art Education in Taiwan Professor Education in Singapore Aesthetic Realism Richard Feynman Graduate school Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Book of Isaiah Humphrey Bogart Economics Education Socrates Coming of Age (TNG episode) Social psychology I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue High school Turkish education system Education in England Singlish American Sign Language German language Great Teacher Onizuka Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus National Certificate of Educational Achievement Time Out of Mind Normal distribution Electrophysiology Spanish language The Book of Five Rings Ludwig Wittgenstein Intelligent design movement Education in Germany E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.

lab ideas for science classes does anyone have any cool suggestions for labs for a th grade biology class or an oceanography class mostly th and th graders i am beginning my teaching career and i want something interesting to do with them but also to show them that i know what i'm talking about i'm so i think teaching year olds will be awkward at first thanks i'm a chemistry physics teacher but i know a couple of ideas for biology something really cool that i've seen done is you take a green laser i think red works but not as well and you use it to make a projection you take an eyedropper and fill it with pondwater then hook up the eyedropper so that it is hanging by a clamp then take a second clamp and clamp partially on the squeeze part so that a drop of water is hanging from the eyedropper but doesn't fall that last part is hard to read but use clamps and have an eyedropper with pond water with drop of water about to fall then hook up the laser so that it shines through the drop the drop will act as a lens and it will project the drop of water in the drop of water will be all kinds of bacteria and paramecium and you can see them swimming around in it i don't know how to make it into a lab but there is a lot of good science in it if you teach photosynthesis then there is a great reverse photosynthesis demonstration called demise of a gummy bear you take potassium chlorate kclo and put it in a test tube then you heat it with a bunsen burner until it looks like a liquid then you drop a gummy bear in and get far away the potassium chlorate produces a bunch of oxygen gas which reacts with the sugar in the gummy bear to make water and carbon dioxide the reverse of photosynthesis also since photosysnthesis requires light the reverse reaction will produce a lot of light kind of like a minifirework if you do that one be careful of the potassium chlorate you don't want to get it on your hands it's something that won't burn right away but will eat through your skin slowly labs i've done we did a chromatography lab with chromatography paper you can separate inks out of differnet colored markers you can also use it with spinach leaves to separate out the pigments very simple to do just use a quarter to smash some pigment from a spinach leaf onto the paper then hang the paper in a container with the solvent i don't remember but probably ethyl acetate acetone would work then it will separate out the different colors we also took spinach leaves and this wasn't easy but you can removed the skin from them a clear layer by tearing them when you tear you'll see a little bit if you rip it correctly then we put those under a microscope and surveyed how many stomates there were if i were teaching oceanography i would show them how to distill seawater and talk about how cost effective it is and how difficult it is on a large scale  Explosive material Water (molecule) Chlorine Sulfuric acid Laser Glass Chromatography Titanium Potassium Paint Electrophysiology Oxygen Stoma Fire extinguisher Acetic acid Solvent Carnivorous plant Tofu Helium Ecology Brewery Hand grenade Methanol Water Carbon dioxide sink Hydrogen economy Hydrogen Sun Welding Petroleum Tattoo Water purification Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Mnemonic Fountain pen Pebble bed reactor Rocket fuel Sulfur Haloalkane Alcohol Planetary habitability Ester Mass spectrometry Eye Acetone Leaf Cell (biology) Biodiesel Solar power Algae Insulin Chlorophyll Rebreather Renewable energy Bacteria Coffee Diving suit Casting Sewage treatment Chemistry Agar plate Concentration Fire Iron John Dalton Silicon Alternative biochemistry Extraterrestrial life Diode Disinfection Aluminium Ocean thermal energy conversion Lighting Japanese tea ceremony Vacuum tube Soldering Copper extraction Sodium Aniline Illegal drug trade Fire fighting Spectroscopy Earth's atmosphere Essential oil Poison Smoke-screen Miller-Urey experiment Pigment Uranium Sugar beet

foul language in class how does one get students to stop using the n word also the word f i hate those words regardless of the connotations th and th graders i use cursing as a great way to teach behavior appropriate for a situation part of the job of teachers is to socialize the students which mean we teach them how to behave in various situations you can't stop them from using those words entirely you can teach them that your classroom is not the appropriate time or place i also have a strict policy of respect in my room if it's legitimately offensive to anyone it's not permitted i explain that foul derogatory language is offensive to me and therefore is not permitted warning i have had to give up parts of my sarcastic sense of humor due to this rule but when the kids see you restrain yourself as well they so more willingly  Profanity Crime Martial art College Ultimate (sport) Baseball Insult Political correctness Euphemism Hate speech Teach the Controversy Leet Intelligent design movement Second language acquisition Gay slang Confucianism Singlish Beavis and Butt-head Equal Protection Clause Irony Liberalism Education in Germany Philosophy of language Rape Boston Public Football (soccer) Infantilism Graduate school Newbie Atheism Classroom Nigger Separation of church and state Asperger syndrome Personal foul Scientology beliefs and practices Freedom of speech Fair use Paradox Milgram experiment Secondary education in Japan The Catcher in the Rye Internet troll Education in Japan Rick Santorum Homophobia Education in the United States Gay Pensacola Christian College Negima Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Massachusetts Institute of Technology Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Guru Engrish Theory of conduct Religious pluralism Transactional analysis Bart chalkboard gags Water polo Ten Commandments Propaganda Stuyvesant High School Pejorative Lesson Queer First Amendment to the United States Constitution Bully The Far Side Determinism John Wycliffe McGuffey Readers Joke Education Hogwarts subjects Philosophy of education Sikhism Japanese tea ceremony University of California, Irvine Inheritance (computer science) Nationalism Southern Poverty Law Center E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.

teachers do you accept late work if so what's your policy i only accept it from my th graders one day late but take off i figure it doesn't ruin their grade that way but they still fail the assignment in reply to elizabeth s all the other th grade teachers don't accept late work at all and we're on a block schedule so i only see them every other day if students turn it in one day late they get two extra days to work on it or three if assigned on a friday in responce to apbanpos and others it's th grade math and they are daily assignments the other class i teach is drama where late work is almost impossible to make up especially group performances but just so you know i also have homework credit cards used sparingly which can get you off the hook from an assignment i am a older student who is currently working on her teaching degree i think that is a very fair policy even the best of students can forget to do their homework once on that note maybe give all your students one 'free pass' where they can turn in their homework day late without plently as far as your policy goes you are still giving them a chance to get some credit for their late work which is very good because it encourages them to still do it if you just say late work zero students will be less likely to do all the work for the class as other users have mentioned i also think their are 'circumstances' where flexiability with late work is a must  Grade (education) Education in Romania Education in the People's Republic of China Bristol Grammar School Homework Education in the United States Education in Germany Education Hunter College High School Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Education in Taiwan No Child Left Behind Act Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Jumpstart 3rd Grade University of Massachusetts Amherst Hogwarts A-level Lynbrook High School Standardized testing College admissions Credit card Theory of conduct Education in Malaysia Bart chalkboard gags Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Boston Public Beatmania IIDX Columbia University Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Advanced Placement Program Affirmative action Master's degree MetroCard Asperger syndrome Great Teacher Onizuka FoxTrot A Course In Miracles Hopkins School Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints James Ruse Agricultural High School Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban YuYu Hakusho Irish Republicanism Stuyvesant High School Shreveport, Louisiana Extreme Programming Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Education in Japan Secondary education in France Phillips Exeter Academy Shaggy dog story Brown University Social rule Calvin and Hobbes Independent school (UK) SAT Experiential education German student movement Murdock-Portal Elementary School President (game) Teen Girl Squad Past teachings of Prem Rawat Glen Ridge, New Jersey Education in Portugal French Second Republic Education in Australia DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Franklin W.
