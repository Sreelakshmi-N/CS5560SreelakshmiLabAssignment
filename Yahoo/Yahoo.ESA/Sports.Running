getting fast so i have this friend and he runs miles in minutes i'm relatively new and the last time i ran miles it was min it was around my time running it but the first time that i timed myself is there any way to get as fast or faster in a relatively short amount of time one year also keeping in mind that he will also get faster in the year if so how should i go around doing it like i said i'm new at running so i'm not sure what good workout strategies are you can not get fast in a short period of time but year is not a short period of time for distance running you know what you have done so begin a program to improve if you are going to run miles or k then you must train for that race run easy days per week that is run at least to miles days per week run harder do tempo or fartlek runs you can also do intervals where you will run from meters up to mile repeats you can run these at race pace or faster so your body will get used to running faster since you have run at about minutes per mile you will need to do the work outs at or per mile when you are able to do that pace in a race then you can adjust your training for your next goal of running faster practice your pace so you do not go out too fast at the beginning of a race it is better to run even if possible you can run a little faster at the end but if you go out too fast you will slow down  Weight training Triathlon Fast bowling Drag racing Marathon (sport) Tempo Dog agility Bubble Bobble Running 24 Hours of Le Mans Seabiscuit Bowling strategy (cricket) Speed of light Bicycling terminology 2005 Iditarod Middle distance track event Cardiac arrhythmia Beatmatching Tank classification Haile Gebrselassie RISC Auto racing Deflation (economics) Butterfly stroke Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's 400 metres Web crawler Sea level rise Cricket Baseball Action potential Swimming Electrophysiology High-speed rail Equine conformation CPU design Fell running Rallying Indianapolis 500 Decompression sickness Paintball Recumbent bicycle TGV Athletics Eventing AIM-120 AMRAAM CPU cache Native American music The Amazing Race Compiler optimization USS Tunny (SS-282) Toyota Prius Hebrew calendar Bay Area Rapid Transit Space Shuttle program 2000 Australian Grand Prix 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Formula One regulations Speed limit Age of Mythology E85 Quantum computer Tai Chi Chuan Backstroke Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 West Indian cricket team Swingout Harness racing Goldberg Variations Extreme Programming Fuel injection Aviation history Year American football strategy Fielding (cricket) NASCAR USS Uhlmann (DD-687) Equation of time Hypoglycemia Gamma ray burst Mount St. Helens USS Wasp (CV-18) Computer National Weather Service March (music) Economy of Russia Exponential growth Unemployment Spectacular Bid Norway national football team Quicksort Sailing Bethalto, Illinois Oscilloscope The Book of Five Rings Gliding Marching band Game programming Railway signalling

alternatives to running on a track im a very active guy and i run every morning on pavement now what are the con's of running on pavement is there any pro's besides the fact that your burning calories building muscle and if the impact on pavement isn't good on your legs what substitutions alternatives are there if you don't live very close to a track p s im live in a moderately sized city approx ppl usually running on the road is the easiest place to run but if you have a trail or path it is easier on your body good shoes will help you recover from running on pavement if you are looking for cardiovascular exercise biking swimming hiking jumping rope will substitute running is the easiest to do for most people the benefit of running on pavement is that it is a smooth surface and you are not likely to step in a hole or on something that can injure you if you run on a path or trail you need to watch the surface to avoid stepping on something good shoes with a good inner sole will usually keep you from pounding your feet and legs even if you are doing very long distance  Triathlon Trail Weight training Swimming Hiking Diving Glossary of climbing terms Aerial (dance move) Fast bowling Climbing equipment Shoe Running Marching band Walking Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Aerobic exercise Iliotibial band syndrome Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling holds Backstroke Drag racing Horse Breaststroke Professional wrestling attacks Iditarod Lake Tahoe Butterfly stroke Energy development Eugene, Oregon Professional wrestling aerial techniques Punt (boat) Mountain biking Horse gait Front crawl Paragliding Pavement (material) Dieting Laws of cricket Road Trapping Cyclo-cross Appalachian Trail Mixed martial arts Collision detection Airbag Motorcycle helmet Skiing Bicycle Surveillance Fecal incontinence High-heeled shoe Muscle Stress fracture Pulaski Skyway Golf Bicycle lighting Mouse (computing) Sailing Foot Professional wrestling slang Skateboarding trick Glossary of American football Inline speed skating Bodybuilding Transportation of Los Angeles Athletics Segregated cycle facilities Dundas Square Full Metal Panic?

what is the life of my running shoes i bought shoes late april and run around miles a week when should i replace them i generally replace my shoes after to miles usually by that time they start to fell flat i e the cushioning doesn't seem as good anymore most shoes today are so well made the uppers still look great after miles but the shoes really aren't protecting your joints well anymore it's fine to wear them for walking around just don't run in them anymore note the above assumes that the shoes are only used for running and not used for other sports or wore during the day for other purposes if not the shoes can be useless for running after a month in addition for low mileage runners i recommend replacing shoes after months of use regardless of mileage some shoes wear unevenly at the heals if you wear completely through the outer black sole it's also time to replace the shoes  Shoe Marathon (sport) Tire Equine conformation High-heeled shoe 1957 World Series Stress fracture Horseshoe The Computer Wore Menace Shoes E85 Triathlon Upholstery Disc brake Barefoot Freddy Fender Carburetor Cliff Richard Running Softball Baseball Billboard Hot 100 Diving Athletic shoe Auto insurance Glossary of climbing terms Reebok Foot Shadow the Hedgehog Iliotibial band syndrome The Beatles discography Blackjack Stairway Social rule Climbing equipment Saint Nicholas Paul Is Dead Interstate Highway Sprint (race) John McDouall Stuart Adidas Trail running Nike, Inc.

wtf why is my time down so much ok so i've been focusing on sprints for the last month ok my baseball team went to the world series for about weeks then i had a baseball camp as well for the last month so i have'nt been able to run distance like i used to i was just able to run and yd dashes after the camps and world series so yesterday i go to get back in my routine when i find i'm down to a mile a month ago i was at mile how can i get back to my old time when soccer and track are approaching ohh yeah but i've been jogging in place for mins each day with lbs of weight did that slow me down or hurt me i really need to get back in shape for soccer your frustration tells me you have high expectations of yourself that's good but such a huge loss in performance is obviously from a lack of rest you need a few days off from any hard exercise to start running is about fluid motion strength and energy over training robs your energy and i personally guarantee no loss of strength in three days of rest running in place with weights on develops the wrong muscles and robs you of excercising muscles which control your dynamic motion it's great to have strong quads and calves but there are dozens of other muscles that don't get any attention because they have long latin names and have only small contributions to your performance running for real develops those in the right balance with the major muscles many injuries come from mismatches in muscle strength sprints are always a heavy workout and you need a rest day afterward or a light training day which is running at a speed that would allow you to talk very long distance and hilly runs are also heavy workouts they do a lot of good but you need to recover for a day or two before more heavy workouts take a few days off let your body heal then ease into your training with a couple of hard workouts a week instead of six i'm guessing on that one and dump the weights serious runners don't do that unless they have a strength training coach telling them exactly how to do it  Weight training Equine conformation Triathlon Running Marathon (sport) Bodybuilding Exercise Ben Johnson (athlete) Swimming Muscle Urinary incontinence Aikido Middle distance track event Athletics Tyrannosaurus rex Toronto Blue Jays Piccolo Junior Saga Baseball Gliding Sprint (race) Tai Chi Chuan Terminal ballistics Chinese martial arts American football Stress fracture Dieting New York Giants Clinical depression Glossary of climbing terms Sport rowing Pittsburgh Steelers Aerial (dance move) Childbirth Babe Ruth Andr__s Galarraga Toronto Raptors Poker jargon Creatine STS-62 Milton H.

for anyone who has run a marathon what shoes did you use you should wear a shoe that has been used for training for at least but not greater than a couple of months keep in mind that a running shoe can last about miles since the padding will wear out after that as for me i run at least marathons a year i had been using reebok shoes from day and i still rely on my reebok i know it is not the most popular brand but it works well for me i used to love the dmx technology which is the liquid gel technology they had since moved on to the foam technology which makes the shoes lighter i usually change the style of shoes since i would buy pairs and run with them for a while and then go shopping for more so by the time i get to the store they had changed to different styles i had a couple of reebok shoes that gave me trouble but after i changed there was no further problem for most part i am very happy with my reebok reebok can be harder to get in chain store so i go to the reebok outlet store which actually will give me more discount other good brands include ascic saucony and new balance not a big fan of nike had tried it and did not like them you just have to try them all in the stores and see which ones fit you better  Reebok Shoe Nike, Inc.

cross country and my ipod well i've been doing cross country for about years i've never really been very good at long distance running and now that i'm in my junior year my motivation to run is low and i really am not sure if i want to continue to run i'm pretty slow and it's hard for me to want to put forth the effor because it seems impossible to catch up to everybody else which brings me to my question i have difficulty keeping up with my teamates right now and i was thinking of bringing my nike ipod to keep track of my pace i thought that it would be really helpful because i can work towards a time goal until i'm ready to chase after my teammates music gets me really pumped up and i get my best times by listening to music would it be really tacky and rude to bring my ipod to the team practices were we have our long distance runs or even for interval or fartlek training thanks i dont think its tacky or rude i do it all the time just get an armband so u dont have to stop and mess with it and more importantly dont give up on urself im a sophmore on my high schools cc team its a great way to stay in shape  2000 Australian Grand Prix Fast bowling Glossary of American football Norway national football team Olympic medalists in athletics (men) Marching band Indianapolis 500 IPod Canadian football Apple Computer 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Bicycle lighting ITunes Extreme Programming Gliding Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 American football Tag 24 Hours of Le Mans Railway signalling Quizbowl Kasparov versus The World Dog agility Poker jargon Fielding (cricket) Social rule 2005 Iditarod RuneScape Mini-Games Singlish Indian Oil Cup 2005 Internal ballistics Team Fortress Classic FairPlay Current teachings of Prem Rawat Aerial (dance move) Wind turbine New York Giants Yao Ming Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Batting (cricket) Alcoholics Anonymous ITunes Music Store Running Baseball Fanny Blankers-Koen Lance Armstrong Hendrick Motorsports Lindy Basic Leeds United F.C.

i'm years old ' lbs i started running again for about two months now and my heart rate is sometimes during the day at rest i run about miles a day days a week at a mile pace my resting hr before i started exercising again was about bpm i'm not at all day but probably for a good hours during the day at night it usually goes up to around what is going on should i see a doctor is this normal help well based on your bmi details in bbc link below you're a bit overweight but you can still be a bit fat and fit i have a bmi of but i'm quite spritely i'm not a doctor just a runner but i you may well have a condition called bradycardia don't panic you probably aren't going to die of it if so you are in good company as many athletes are bradycardic lance armstrong being one of many basically the more you exercise the more efficient your heart becomes using the analogy of the heart as a bucket you have a bigger bucket now the heart can pump the same amount of blood as before but in less beats for more about the bucket analogy check out the second article linked below which was the one i found when i had a similar question when i started exercise as in stopped being sedentary my resting heart rate rhr was around ergo my heart was not in good shape last month i did more than hours of cv work in the gym during the week plus a couple of races at weekends and my rhr is i'm rhr should be measured first thing in the morning whilst lying down if you do that you'll probably find it is even lower than as for the fluctuations that will may well be down to factors such as activity level what you've just watched on tv or how much coffee you've drunk caffeine is a stimulant by the way slightly off topic but i've seen another article which i can't find on this subject that says your maximum hr is genetically programmed but your rhr reduces with increased fitness the usual rule of thumb is your mhr is your age in your case but this isn't accurate for all my mhr is which is why i found out all this stuff as i was as concerned as the guy in the runners world article see the wikipedia article also linked for more on bradycardia you haven't mentioned it but if you have other symptoms i think you should see a doctor  Heart rate Hypertension Obesity Marathon (sport) Urinary incontinence Anorexia nervosa Hypoglycemia Weight training Equine conformation Insomnia Breastfeeding Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chronic fatigue syndrome Prostate cancer Myocardial infarction Propranolol Blood pressure Exercise Unemployment Cardiovascular disease Coronary heart disease Sleep apnea Sleep Dieting Bradycardia Diabetes mellitus Theory of conduct Drowning Carburetor Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Carbon dioxide Fast bowling Folic acid Fuel injection First aid Tachycardia Extreme Programming Cardiac stress test Time ELO rating system Super Size Me Stroke Thermoregulation Labour economics Insurance Milton H.

im and if i run hills everyday will this decrease my strength in the legs and lower my abilty in running i am a cc coach and would suggest a hill work out once or twice a week the purpose of hill running is to strengthen your legs for hilly courses and for future speed work and races what you should do check with your coach first though is to increase the number of times you go up and down a hill and increase the distance of the hill for ex after a minute warmup run hills with each hill being minutes in duration then next time run hills etc after a while increase your time on the hill to minutes the day after your hill work out should be a recovery day and a good easy long run would work on endurance without injuring yourself good luck with your training  Weight training Paragliding Triathlon Equine conformation Batting (cricket) Swimming Interstate Highway Iliotibial band syndrome Breaststroke Redundant array of independent disks Gliding 24 Hours of Le Mans Backstroke Pittsburgh Steelers Wind turbine Elis Prefecture Avalanche Butterfly stroke Parachuting Passenger car Memorial Stadium, Clemson Indian Railways Boxing The Amazing Race Recumbent bicycle Stroke Bicycle High-speed rail Speed reading Myocardial infarction Fencing Fast bowling Iditarod USS Tunny (SS-282) Pioneer Zephyr Stress fracture San Francisco 49ers Soap opera Fecal incontinence Climbing specialist (cycling) Fell running Sport Dog agility University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Time Action potential New Zealand cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Conscription Horse The Amazing Race 6 Year New York Giants Stuttering Cincinnati Bengals Sailing Norway national football team Indianapolis 500 Paget's disease of bone Tour de France Torquay United F.C.

would a jogger burn up any more or less calories running on soft or hard ground and would the same rules apply to walking soft ground burns up more calories because slightly more effort is needed because there is less resitance in the ground if you bounce a ball off a soft wall verses a harder wall then you get the same result more of the energy is involved in moving the ball off the wall so like the jogger more of the energy is returned in the foot leaving the ground with soft ground some of the energy is soaked up by the less resistance gound as you push the ground down this is the same reason why sand is so difficult to run on  Volleyball Fast bowling Table tennis Squash (sport) Drill bit Seismic retrofit Internal ballistics Dundas Square Dodgeball Pottery Energy Laws of cricket Explosive material Equine conformation Running Tai Chi Chuan Golf club (equipment) Tofu Racquetball Aluminium Baseball Four square Aerial (dance move) Nuclear explosion Skateboarding trick Fire fighting Rugby union Professional wrestling throws Snooker Professional wrestling aerial techniques Rolling-element bearing Golf Strap-on dildo Terminal ballistics Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Casting Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Anchor Horse gait Car handling Softball Canadian football Campfire Electrophysiology Spark plug 2004 World Series Glossary of partner dance terms Golf glossary Glossary of climbing terms 1957 World Series Professional wrestling holds Piccolo Junior Saga Lightning Handloading Etching Real tennis Date Palm Weight training Impact crater Entropy Cricket Cricket ball Home run Fenway Park Plastic Soft energy path Football (soccer) Comparison of Canadian and American football Field hockey Tag Radar Calorie Blood (computer game) Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Squash tennis Manual transmission Leather Nuclear fusion Tango (dance) General relativity Hard disk Mass Tennis Dieting Football Billiards Beer Pong 2004 American League Championship Series Naruto jutsu Sewage treatment Butterfly stroke Batting (cricket) Science Water polo American football Swimming Human position Ton

new runner with a sore hip hey i've recently started running about two months back because i figured i should be doing more exercise and i thought it'd be a fun hobby i really enjoy it and am thinking of running km and km fun runs at some point i'm not fast at all but i'm working on it i currently run something like a minute km anyway i've been having some issues with my right hip it tends to get sore if i run for a while improves if i stay away from running for a while and worsens if i run more partly i think this may be the inconsistency with which i run but there's probably some things i'm missing i'll concede it might be my shoes i've reverted to an old pair cause the others would give me bad blisters and they weren't really meant for running can anyone recommend any good stretches advice i know i'm probably just going to have to cross train for a while until i can afford new shoes ps i warm up for minutes stretch run warm down and stretch again consiste k in minutes is pretty respectable i race about once a month though mostly k and h m and i've seen plenty of k competitors finishing well beyond minutes yep shoes are important have a look at the link below if you're wearing the wrong type of shoes that could be the cause of your problem if you're running a circular route try reversing it the fact that the pain is only on the right side could be due to the camber of the surface the slope that stops rainwater collecting i put a second link from the runners world site which is about runners hips which might help but if not there is a load of other medical sports injury articles on their site  Marathon (sport) Equine conformation Weight training Iliotibial band syndrome Mattress Softball Massage 1957 World Series Triathlon Drag racing 2000 Australian Grand Prix Aerial (dance move) Climbing equipment Diving Fast bowling High-heeled shoe Denis Law Norway national football team The Amazing Race Shaggy dog story Andr__s Galarraga Exercise Boxing Domestic rabbit 2005 Iditarod Pointe shoes Ben Johnson (athlete) Iditarod First aid New York Giants Repetitive strain injury Swimming Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Tour de France Extreme Programming Car handling Homestar Runner Avalanche Swingout Theory of conduct Babe Ruth Chicago White Sox Corset Poker jargon Professional wrestling holds Hiking Whose Line Is It Anyway?

quick way to improve mile time i've been at a week camp all summer for science we worked out maybe days a week if that but i had to walk to classes which averaged probably about miles a day not including afternoon activities so it wasn't just a lazy summer however i got back about a week ago and have been working out running squats lunges etc like crazy because soccer try outs are next week to make varsity we have to run laps mi in mins i ran last night my lap times was around i don't think i was running my hardest though do you have any ideas of how to improve that time in a week aerobic conditiong sprints nutrition advice etc sorry miles lol if you could run miles in minutes you'd be an amazing runner that works out to for k which is quite a bit faster than the current world record with one week there isn't much you can do it takes two to three weeks for training to have much effect if you can run by yourself you will be able to run quite a bit faster when you are running with your teammates i'd focus on basic conditioning that will help you throughout the soccer season to minutes of easy running every other day should be plenty in addition to whatever soccer practice you're doing be careful about exercising too much otherwise you will just be sore and your time will be worse one harder workout you may want to try is a pace workout at the target speed for laps miles works out to for two laps try the following warm up and stretch run laps m at don't run faster than this jog or walk for minutes repeat and three times for a total of m runs stetch and cool down do this workout preferably days before the time trial but if you must days before it will train you to run the goal pace without the complete stress of running the entire laps at once go easy the two days before the time trial stay hydrated eat a good diet and get plenty of sleep  Weight training Running Indianapolis 500 Marathon (sport) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Triathlon Middle distance track event Swimming Equine conformation 24 Hours of Le Mans Seabiscuit 2005 Iditarod Baseball Aerobic exercise Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Babe Ruth Ben Johnson (athlete) The Amazing Race Stomach cancer Clinical depression Haile Gebrselassie Social rule The Ashlee Simpson Show Ayrton Senna Tony Stewart First aid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bodybuilding Sprint (race) Fast bowling Unreal Atkins Nutritional Approach Breastfeeding Ernie Irvan Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Drill instructor Lance Armstrong Medicine Fecal incontinence CPU design Andr__s Galarraga Central processing unit Chronic fatigue syndrome The Citadel (Military College) American football Iditarod Heart rate Iliotibial band syndrome 2005 Hungarian Grand Prix Theory of conduct Tire Ravi Shastri World Series Tour de France Climate of the United Kingdom Horse gait Welding Volleyball Tung Chung Electrophysiology Athletics NASCAR Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder RISC Violin IBM PC compatible STS-62 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Pittsburgh Steelers Certified Nursing Assistant Lake Speed Dieting Detroit Tigers 2005 United States Grand Prix Norway national football team Education in the People's Republic of China Fanny Blankers-Koen New York Giants Physical fitness Dog agility Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics Football (soccer) Michael Schumacher Hendrick Motorsports Mario Kart 64 Compiler optimization The Cure Hypertension

distance running question i've heard before that you're supposed to try noit to run on the road because pavement doesnt give and over time will affect and hurt your body today i ran and my knees started hurting in the back i dont think it was a muscle it seemed more like the bone hurting it felt like id been sitting with the back of my knees ontop of somthign such as the way you sit on a chair and finally getting up and going running ive been running regularly only for about a month im and pretty athletic enough to the point that i dont think that this is me being out of shape can anyone suggest what the problem is if its any problem at all and how i might be able to help it also any tips for becoming a better long distance runner running on the road is fine if you wear good running shoes most running injuries are the result of overuse usually it is from increasing training too fast too many hard days in a row or too much fast running this is especially true for beginners who go from nothing to running several days a week or don't know the correct pace to run does the pain in your knee increase stay the same or go away after your have been running for a while if it goes away it is probably ok to continue running if the pain gets worse then you should not run here's a link to runnersworld about common knee pain http www runnersworld com article s html usually the treatment is to reduce or stop running ice the knee and do appropriate stretching and strengthening exercises if you can't run then cross train doing something that doesn't irritate the knee it can take to weeks for a complete recovery the best tips i can give are wear good shoes replace them every to miles or every months whichever comes first do no wear your running shoes for other purposes if you do they can be useless for running after a few weeks even if they still look new mix up your training don't run the same thing every day make sure you take easy days for recovery it is better to run easy than to run hard and get injured time spent running is generally more important than speed or miles stretch and do core strengthening exercises to complement the running many running injuries are a result of weak core muscles  Equine conformation Running Iliotibial band syndrome Swimming Fast bowling Volleyball Weight training Fecal incontinence Urinary incontinence Marathon (sport) Professional wrestling holds Massage Carpal tunnel syndrome Pain Aerial (dance move) Triathlon Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Exercise 1957 World Series Backstroke Breaststroke Prostate cancer Osteoarthritis Anterior cruciate ligament Chair Alcoholics Anonymous Menstrual cup First aid Marching band Traumatic brain injury Breastfeeding Tai Chi Chuan Social rule Stuttering Milton H.

how do i improve my mile repeat times i ran and yesterday should i keep them the same or make one easier than the other any ideas you should run at your projected race pace if you are racing miles then do x mile with a short recovery at what you think you should be averaging in the mile race there is a big difference between your times is that because the first was too fast and you could not do the second or was the second the fast time which means you did not run the first one hard enough you can mix up your intervals do a day of repeats at a little faster than race pace getting a minute recovery you can change the work outs by controlling the recovery times either harder with less time or easier with more time  Fast bowling Redundant array of independent disks Triathlon Seabiscuit Marathon (sport) Bicycling terminology Running CPU design Horse gait 24 Hours of Le Mans Backup Drag racing Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's 400 metres Bubble Bobble RISC Tempo Pump It Up Indianapolis 500 Turbocharger Auto racing Sport rowing Butterfly stroke Rallying 2005 Iditarod Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Gamma ray burst Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Weight training Parade (military) Extreme Programming Hypoglycemia Volleyball Team time trial T-34 Fell running Tank classification Alcoholics Anonymous GunZ The Duel M4 Sherman Deflation (economics) Inflation Equine conformation Apple II family Standardbred horse Goldberg Variations Recumbent bicycle NeXT Jack Hearne (John Thomas Hearne) Toyota Prius Hard disk Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics Breaststroke Cryptanalysis Speed of light Types of bowlers in cricket E85 Middle distance track event IBM PC compatible Compiler optimization Gemini 8 Punt (boat) Drifting (motorsport) The Amazing Race Overkill (band) L4 microkernel family Harness racing Batting average Ravi Shastri Dynamic random access memory Stage (bicycle race) Computer Linux Beatmatching San Francisco Municipal Railway Windows 2000 Unreal 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Naval Station Norfolk Control Data Corporation Jet engine Backstroke Whitewater Audio level compression Demographics of France Sea level rise Difficulty level 8 mm video format Tropical year Atrial flutter Day CPU cache Resident Evil 2 Aviation history Haile Gebrselassie Terminator 2: Judgment Day Cardiac arrhythmia Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Messerschmitt Me 163 Valentino Rossi

cross country help ok im a new runner is a good mile time what time should a beginner have for miles anddoes stride meter that is pretty good you have only started running and running is a progressive style thing the thing is that you must never accept that you have a limit you can go as far as god makes possible and your heart and will alone can carry you great distances but in order to get faster you must not get the idea in your head that you want to beat others but you want to get faster to further you i have found this to be the case when you concentrate on you that is when you see the results when you look at others skills that is when you feel defeated and you don't have your full potential realize that others are gifted as well and that you too can become beautiful in your own time good luck with you running and don't ever fail to relax god bless  Fast bowling Norway national football team Paragliding Triathlon Ben Johnson (athlete) Baseball Cross country running Marathon (sport) Hurdling Jazz Ontological argument Summa Theologiae Second Battle of the Atlantic Action potential God Emperor of Dune Beatmania IIDX Cross-country skiing Bhajan Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's 400 metres Mach kernel Interstate Highway Speed of light Eventing Socrates The Great Race (Care Bears) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Kain (Legacy of Kain) Jewish services Equine conformation Repentance Current teachings of Prem Rawat Predestination 24 Hours of Le Mans Social rule Justification (theology) Roman Catholic Church 100 metres Team Fortress Classic Jon Secada Bike lane debate Peter Shilton Athletics Fell running Parachuting Free will Eastern Orthodox Church Spacecraft propulsion Charles Goodyear Backstroke Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Olympic medalists in athletics (men) Middle distance track event Oh My Goddess!

double twin jogging stoller recommendation i am looking for a double jogging stroller it will be used for jogging but also for errands festivals malls etc i think i would need one with a locking swivel from wheel but beyond that i do not know any suggestions i am not a hardcore runner by any means but i would like something durable thanks also any insight on the all terrain strollers with front wheels are they better try to buy from craigslist or ebay the strollers on ebay will be more expensive but newer the strollers on craigslist will probably be older but cheaper in my opinion the swivel is just another moving part that can fail so i would avoid it i believe all three of mine are baby jogger brand a removable sun wind cover is nice if you run with it you will want to take it off because it can be hard to push the stroller in the wind on the other hand if you are taking them to sea world or something the cover is nice to keep the sun out of their eyes the drawback for my strollers is that i have to take them apart to get them in the back of the suburban and they can be a little large in the malls even then it is just cotter pins and or quick release wheels you will get used to it the triple really takes up space if you want to spend some you can get one that folds up nicely without having to do any disassembly another is that the front wheels stick out pretty far maybe that swivel wheel might be good for you after all when you are going to the malls etc bigger wheels are nicer for jogging i take them on a crushed granite trail with no problems i say you should go the craigslist route and get several for cheap so you have one for every situation  Bulk vending Gramophone record Textile manufacturing Running Mouse (computing) Professional wrestling throws Heckler & Koch G3 Shopping mall Motorcycle GunBound Anchor Professional wrestling attacks Poker jargon Tire Tractor Dundas Square Chess strategy and tactics Internal ballistics Floppy disk Bicycle lighting Craigslist Professional wrestling match types Professional wrestling holds Baby transport Sport utility vehicle Kodocha Rugby union positions Digital photography Lindy Basic Combine (Half-Life 2) Extreme Programming Baseball Theory of conduct Dinghy Bicycle brake systems MMORPG Knife Rear wheel drive Redundant array of independent disks 2000 Australian Grand Prix Professional wrestling slang Contra Costa County, California Panama Canal Aerial (dance move) Plastic Bicycle Hiawatha Line Wind turbine M16 (rifle) Energy development Powerbomb Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Naval mine Mattress Connecticut Hot Wheels Suplex Ford Thunderbird Naruto jutsu Revolver Cross-country skiing W.

what should i do to minimize soreness i'm ' over the last month or so i've begun working out running about times a week plus some crunches and dumbells at home i've dropped about lbs over that time and have feel pretty good sunday i had a triple header softball game and here i am two days later i'm still extremely soar specifically in my upper legs i realize that i wont usually be playing games in a row or exercising to this extent often but are there specific excercises i could be doing to help prevent this also is it wise to excercise run when you are soar like this or should i wait it out before running again my friend it may not sound like this makes sense but it works for me whenver i am sore especially in my legs running is usually a cure well more like a fast jog and for a short distance enough to get the blood pumping through your legs it helps the soreness becuase it brings oxygenated blood back to the muscle sitting round makes it worse because it doesn't get the oxygenated blood as fast a very good exercise to combat fatigue in your thighs i forget the name you take weights in both hands preferably something around hold them straight to your sides then take a step forward and bed at the knee till the opposite knee touches or comes close to the floor then slowly come back to a standing position and repeat with other leg if your legs feel like they are going to fall off afterwards you are doing it right after a week or two of these you will see a very big improvement in strength and endurance good luck  Equine conformation Weight training Professional wrestling throws Aerial (dance move) Swingout Softball Horizontal bar Professional wrestling attacks Fast bowling Parade (military) Powerbomb Iliotibial band syndrome Glossary of ballet terms Skateboarding trick Running Breaststroke Dog training Mixed martial arts Glossary of partner dance terms Professional wrestling aerial techniques Poker jargon Swimming Psoriasis Traumatic brain injury Repetitive strain injury Baseball Diving Chair Sport rowing Backstroke Chronic fatigue syndrome Casualty lifting Glossary of climbing terms Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shaggy dog story Urinary incontinence Umpire (cricket) Deadlift Neckbreaker Double bass Batting (cricket) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Muscle Fecal incontinence Suplex New York Giants Rugby union positions Prostate cancer Piledriver (professional wrestling) Tetrapod Dialysis Radiation therapy Andr__s Galarraga Marching band Knee Atherosclerosis Team Fortress Classic Strap-on dildo Mattress Stomach cancer Dairy Horse Fencing Norway national football team Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 1957 World Series Horse gait Glossary of American football Side pass (dance move) Characters of Naruto GunZ The Duel Diabetes mellitus Massage Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Piccolo Junior Saga Mr. Olympia Knife Butterfly stroke Textile manufacturing 24 Hours of Le Mans Babe Ruth Sniper Archery Water polo Kodocha Bodyline Triathlon Charleston (dance move) Squat (exercise) Marathon (sport)

if you jog mile how many calories would you burn i am lbs ' calories burned while running for the most part depends on weight and distance ran not speed it's simple physics energy is the ability to do work and work is distance traveled by mass calories energy and no matter what speed you're going you're still moving the same mass the same distance the only slight advantage running at a higher intensity would give is a tiny bit more calories burned after the workout and even though walking the distance moves your body the same amount the mechanics of running and walking are so different that calorie burned aren't the same speed would be work over a period of time so a higher speed for the same amount of time would burn more calories but for a set distance speed doesn't matter for when you factor in the time for the distance it cancels out work mass distance moved power work period of time work period of time period of time work this is fact don't listen to anyone who tells you otherwise just because the human body is involved it doesn't mean the laws of physics are negated for someone who's lbs a single mile ran will burn calories good luck  Energy Spacecraft propulsion Gravity Explosive material Speed of light Faster-than-light Special relativity Tide Dieting Mass Internal ballistics Escape velocity Temperature Equine conformation Planetary orbit Mercury (planet) Carburetor Action potential Pound Bicycle Jet engine Potential energy Radar Dualism (philosophy of mind) Fermi paradox Kinetic energy Wind turbine Black body General relativity Black hole Planck units Orbital speed Nuclear fusion Triathlon Speed limit Social rule Zeno's paradoxes Astrodynamics Photon Terminal ballistics Bicycle lighting Heat Power (physics) Resonance Torque Central processing unit Obesity Galactic Civilizations Dimensional analysis Neutrino Units of measurement Center of mass Scramjet Floppy disk Super Size Me Classical mechanics Bodybuilding Swimming Hybrid vehicle Terran (StarCraft) Marathon (sport) TGV Renormalization Light E85 Dietary fiber Velocity Gravitational slingshot Two-body problem Dark energy Tests of general relativity Theory of conduct Bird migration Electron Solar system Electric motor Nuclear fission Milk Welding Ethernet Force Sun Stopping power Energy development Luminiferous aether Electrophysiology Bullet Vacuum Particle physics

will a tredmill give u a good workout like running in the park i feel that it does not i feel that when i am on a treadmill that i let the treadmill do some of the work pulling my feet back rather than me pushing forward also by running in the park you will have hill which you go up and down making the overall run more challenging although some of the newer treadmills can increase and decrease the incline while you run to give you a similar affect you can get a good workout from both and there are advantages and disadvantages to both find which you prefer is my best advise  Weight training Motility Equine conformation Internal ballistics Mouse (computing) Strap-on dildo Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Biped DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Floyd Rose M16 (rifle) Heart rate Backstroke Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Breaststroke Rugby union The Contender (television series) Cerritos, California Zoom (comics) Treadmill Euphemism Swimming Canoe Carburetor Recumbent bicycle Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Mechanical advantage Radio controlled airplane Central processing unit Punt (boat) Wind turbine Butterfly stroke American Gladiators Drowning Sailing Digital photography Sonic the Hedgehog Economic inequality Single-speed bicycle Sleeve valve Rugby union positions Free trade Roller coaster Autogyro Fenway Park Redundant array of independent disks Manual transmission Blackjack Bicycle brake systems Aerial (dance move) Inflation Green Line "E" Branch Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Volleyball Arimaa Bodybuilding Turbocharger Baseball Bicycle lighting Clinical depression RISC Professional wrestling aerial techniques Mach kernel Cardiac stress test Dog agility Swingout Powerbomb Jet engine Front crawl Angina Steering Edgware, Highgate and London Railway Table tennis Professional wrestling attacks Electrophysiology Professional wrestling throws Tram Bicycle Progressive tax MP3 High-speed rail Triathlon Professional wrestling holds Quake III Arena Gross domestic product Linked list HMS Dreadnought (1906) Mattress Moon Airsoft Expert system Utilitarianism Four-stroke cycle Diving Porsche 911 Quicksort Battle of Chancellorsville Policy Debate Rapid transit Heckler & Koch G3

why do i get stomach cramps while i run i run about to miles every day my legs never cramp up it's only my stomach more specifically either the right or left areas under my ribs after maybe the first minutes of running the cramps start my old cross country coach told me it was because i was breathing incorrectly she told me to inhale only through my nose and exhale only through my mouth consecutively so far it hasn't been working unless i'm using that technique incorrectly and i never eat within at least hours before i run nor do i drink a lot of water before or during the run so can anybody tell me why this is happening and how to prevent this first it is still a big mystery to many physiologists and doctors as to what is the real cause of stomach cramps the experts have theorized that the common side stitch as they are sometimes called it's short for a long complicated medical term is caused by the exertion that running and bouncing forces inside the abdominal walls basically your stomach and other organs like the spleen and liver bump into each other as your feet jar the ground causing connective tissue to stretch on the nerves and cause pain this connective tissue is also attached to your diaphragm which helps with breathing this pain is usually on the right side and just under the ribs exercise like horseback riding running and sit ups are common causes of the side stitch here are some ways to prevent or lessen the pain of the common side stitch do not run on a full stomach you shouldn t drink large amounts of water or eat hours before exercise sip small amounts swallows before and during exercise and wait to fully re hydrate until after the workout dehydration can cause cramping as well so do not ignore water during running always sip a few swallows at regular intervals especially if running for more than minutes and in hot temperatures decrease fast pace for a few minutes and continue deep breathing techniques during running a common running sequence is a three step inhale and two step exhale pattern slowing down your pace will allow for you to keep up with that pattern as you increase to near maximum speed your breathing will become more labored however you can push through the pain and keep your pace if you concentrate on breathing deep by pushing your stomach out when you inhale and relaxing it as you exhale pre stretch before running one of the best ways to pre stretch the area is to lift your arms over your head and lean to the left and right at the waist do more lower back and abdominal exercises having a strong core will help you prevent the side stitch  Professional wrestling holds Equine conformation Drowning Stomach cancer Abdomen Lung First aid Aerial (dance move) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Massage Fecal incontinence Professional wrestling throws Fast bowling Hiccup Swimming Urinary incontinence Exercise Acupuncture Backstroke Diving regulator Scuba set Pneumonia Hypoglycemia Diabetes mellitus Asthma Knitting Paget's disease of bone Dehydration Vomiting Autonomic nervous system Action potential Horse gait Volleyball Butterfly stroke Hyperthermia Carbon dioxide Mattress Front crawl Bong Childbirth Kidney 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Marathon (sport) Gastroesophageal reflux disease Jet engine Cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chronic fatigue syndrome Enzyme Siphon Reptile Sport rowing Tobacco smoking Obesity Insulin Pain Myocardial infarction Cannabis (drug) Tightlacing Fire fighting Obstetrics Shaggy dog story Gastroparesis Boxing Glossary of American football Skateboarding trick Sleep Horse Swingout Stroke Aortic dissection Running Dialysis Diazepam Local anesthesia Aikido Babe Ruth Carpal tunnel syndrome Professional wrestling attacks Crocodilia Suplex Menstrual cup Breastfeeding Hatha yoga Professional wrestling aerial techniques Muscle Diarrhea Suicide methods Mesothelioma Marching band Oral sex

can i use my track spikes for xc my events in track were the m and the m these were the nike spikes that i had http www nike com index jhtml l nikestore grid pdp cid gid pid grid s rival md iii re us co us la en i only used these for track meets miles total are these also suitable to wear for xc since it's a k race the spikes on these aren't rubber in fact they're really hard sturdy spikes that's why i don't think it should be a problem that's actually a tough call most middle distance spikes like the ones you linked to are designed to go up to about miles so if you are racing a k they may be inappropriate i would recommend showing them to your coach and getting their opinion as for the people that say you should have different shoes for track and xc they are wrong the shoe itself can be safely used in different seasons though you will need to replace the actual metal spikes it only matters that you are using it correctly so if you sprint in track you'll need a different pair as you point out you never build up many miles on your race shoes in fact in high school i never wore out a pair of spikes though i did out grow of them so my answer maybe  Nike, Inc.

running on the treadmill is it good running on the treadmill a mile once a day as long as you eat healthy i just turned and am punds also am i overweight with height of five foot five yes running on a treadmill is healthy one mile a day is fine to start off but try and build to about minutes of running a day or three to four miles such a cardiovascular workout will have numerous health benefits be sure to keep yourself motivated you start to lose conditioning after hours of no activity so be sure to keep up on your workout also be sure to stretch if you find that you are having trouble keeping motivated try doing something else while you are running on the treadmill listening to music is a good option i have also seen multitudes of people read while the run at my gym if you still find that you are unmotivated then ditch the treadmill and run outside this provides a great way to work out not get bored on your workout and also get to know your city a little bit better  Weight training Exercise Obesity Bodybuilding Triathlon Heart rate Physical fitness Treadmill Andrew Dice Clay Folic acid Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Myocardial infarction Cardiovascular disease William E.

the big question walking or running what are the benefits of each i know they must be similar but to me it seems that running is the better one to chose i do both but i'm wonder which is best in the long run pros cons obviously there are no true cons of either but i'm talking in muscle size areas that are targeted overall health etc thanks okay well running is much better for your health depending on your curent situation if you were to have hip problems artheritis or other joint pain then walking would be better however running is better because it gets your heartbeat going faster and it trains your body to circulate oxygen through the blood better this is also known as cardiovascular or cardiorespratory training both exercises work in different zones so depending on what your goal is either could be more beneficial walking is in the fat burning zone because of the pace you are going and the heartrate you maintain while walking running moves up to the next level of cardiovascular training but it does burn more calories because you have to work harder at it  Weight training Exercise Aerobic exercise Tai Chi Chuan Circulatory system Cardiovascular disease Heart Osteoarthritis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chronic fatigue syndrome Obesity Atkins Nutritional Approach Diabetes mellitus Stroke Tocopherol Growth hormone treatment Atherosclerosis Medicine Prostate cancer Coronary heart disease Milk Aikido Energy development Cancer Breastfeeding Babe Ruth Meditation Growth hormone Aspartame Dog Insulin Traumatic brain injury Marathon (sport) Massage Stem cell Triathlon Cholesterol Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Anorexia nervosa Running Cocaine Decompression sickness Brain Dietary fiber First aid Scientology beliefs and practices Low-carbohydrate diet Blood (computer game) Puberty Nutrition Folic acid Calorie restriction Osteopathy Muscle Qigong Anxiety Chinese martial arts Super Size Me Horse gait Physical therapy GunBound Blood pressure COX-2 inhibitor Vegetarianism Fibromyalgia Cardiac arrhythmia Eye Cannabis (drug) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Thermoregulation Tobacco smoking Fast bowling Pneumonia Malaria Stomach cancer Explosive material Childbirth Archery Ecology Reflexology Baseball Redundant array of independent disks Expert system Angina Heart rate Sleep Human physiology Methamphetamine Clinical depression Word of Wisdom Growth hormone deficiency Local anesthesia Coffee Dinosaur Carburetor

i'm scared for cross country season i love running i just don't really i am mostly doing it to keep healthy and to beat this one girl that i beat all the time last year i'm super scared that she is going to get better than me i complain to my mom all the time but she won't listen anymore because i bother her so much about that some one give me some good advice or quotes to make me feel good about running and stop worrying if she beats me or not no person maybe i didn't understand i love doing cross country i love the fact that i can run that long that far in that time i just have an obsession with winning all the time oops u didn't understand very nice tom but i don't really think of cross country as a team sport if we don't have enough girls to make a team i consider running a sport for oneself not for the team i don't care if the team wins just as long as i come out victorious i'm happy here's a quote for you the unexamined life is not worth living basically dont run cross country you can still run to stay healthy without running competitively if you run because you love the sport then go ahead but if you're only running to satisfy a vendetta thats doing it for the wrong reasons and you wont enjoy it if you've beaten her already then great bow out while you're ahead and never give her the chance to show you up and ask your mom to help you get over your sense of obsession with this other girl no good is ever going to come of that and your mom certainly doesnt deserve to have to hear you talk about it all the time  Theory of conduct Pok__mon Live!

does running with music help you run better if i run with music will my times get better improve does music do anything physically for you running or just mentally music has no direct relation to the workout you experience when you run but it can help you run depending on your type of workout or stage in the workout a song with a beat that matches your desired pace would be good to listen to because your mind will automatically match itself to the rhythm of the song yes even if you have no sense of rhythm and therefore helping you keep a certain pace so if you are in a speed portion of your workout a fast song would help you keep up the pace whereas for your warmdown you may listen to a slower paced song listening to music while you run is strictly a matter of preference but i strongly recommend it to anyone who has trouble keeping motivated or keeping an upbeat pace while running  Weight training Fast bowling Music genre CPU cache Marching band Rapping Triathlon Cardiac arrhythmia Beatmatching Beatmania IIDX Tempo Heavy metal music Dance Dance Revolution Music Glossary of partner dance terms Clinical depression Horse gait Musical terminology Spark plug Rhythm and blues Bodybuilding Rhythm Metal music Metre (music) DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Judas Priest Jet engine Sant Mat Jam band Gas metal arc welding Squash (sport) Drum and bass Bowling strategy (cricket) Types of bowlers in cricket Physical fitness Folk music Nu metal Lindy Hop Beat (music) March (music) Dance Dance Revolution KONAMIX Funk Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Current teachings of Prem Rawat Popular music Herbie Hancock Blues Bhajan Jazz Bubble Bobble Alternative hip hop Death rock Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Rugby union positions Extreme Programming Music of Hungary Marathon (sport) Time signature Freestyle music Ska 2Step Trance music Artificial pacemaker Thrash metal Martial art Alcoholics Anonymous Andr__s Galarraga Beat generation Eurobeat Tango (dance) Wind turbine Brian Statham Nuclear magnetic resonance Carnatic music Iggy Pop Fasting English cricket team Black Sabbath CPU design Speed of light Salsa music Oscilloscope Hip hop music Adult contemporary music Songwriter Syncopation Sampling (music) Redundant array of independent disks Urinary incontinence Remix CDC 6600 The Wall Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Pop music Gabber music Music video game Attention Manual transmission

how do i measure distance on my training i want to start running a friend of mine made a training plan for me with how much to run each day but how do i measure the distance i run i plan to run in forest so i can't realy measure it on the map and also where can i find more info about running like how to start some training plans etc the simple solution is to run by minutes and not worry about the distance after a while you will learn your pace and then you can estimate the distance training by time is actually better than training by distance to minutes at an easy pace to times per week is really the magic number for fitness and recreational running if you absolutely have to know how far you've run use one of the online maps such as google earth to measure the distance of the run if you are a gadget person buy a garmin forerunner or a polar rs these high tech training watches measure speed and distance for running info try http www runnersworld com http www runningtimes com http www coolrunning com  Uniform Resource Locator Hipparchus (astronomer) Drag racing Paragliding Warp drive Time Zeno's paradoxes Geodesy Marathon (sport) Triathlon Web crawler Map Dog agility World Wide Web Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Celestial navigation Running RISC Battle of the Somme (1916) Navigation Latitude Domain Name System Gliding BitTorrent Phishing Speed of light Artificial neural network Apollo 8 Solar variation Extreme Programming Astrodynamics Tide High-speed rail Ole R__mer Longitude Second Battle of the Atlantic Cassini-Huygens Action potential Electrophysiology Indian Railways Mach kernel Elis Prefecture Ozone depletion Electric motor Ethernet Chromatography Technology Bicycle lighting Naked eye Internet Slashdot subculture IBM PC compatible Squid cache Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Random walk CPU design USS Tunny (SS-282) Common Unix Printing System HyperText Transfer Protocol Economy of Colombia Torque Heart rate Calculus Radar Extrasolar planet Ozone hole Surveillance Whois Quantum computer Train C__ile Ferate Rom__ne Data clustering Dynamical system Prague Metro Luminiferous aether Explosive material Map projection 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Statistics Tenshinhan Global Positioning System Trigonometric function Sprint (race) Railway signalling Metre Oscilloscope Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Speed reading Velocity Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Luminosity Comet Hyakutake Sonar Pioneer Zephyr Marching band Current teachings of Prem Rawat Michelson-Morley experiment Electronic commerce RuneScape quests

is it easier to run on grass or concrete tarmac i listen to music while i run and sometimes i get a headache while running on the pavement ive tried running on grass and i dont get it but i think it might be harder please help i'm running on pavement constantly will tear up your legs and will give you a pounding headache grass is the much better choice as it is much softer it's a little bit more difficult to run on grass simply because you need to push of a little bit harder in comparison to a firmer surface if you can dirt is always the best way to go you are much less likely to get injured hope this helps  Mattress Fast bowling Pavement (material) Airport Drill bit Road Anchor Cheese Lawn mower Charles Ives Runway Pete Sampras Diving Chair Rachel Corrie MP3 Jam (TV series) Equine conformation Clothing Hard disk Asphalt concrete Tennis Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Belmont Park Motorcycle Tyrannosaurus rex Internal ballistics Traumatic brain injury Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tick Tennis court Gothic metal Table tennis Gravel Snowboard Professional wrestling slang Tunnel boring machine Dundas Square Unreal Carl G.

i have some questions about cross country training i'm years old my mile time is around min or less and i can run miles around the track at min mile how many miles should i run a day to get ready for cross country where should i train for cross country there's no hills around me mostly streets how many days a week should i take off how fast should i be running min mile thanks for your help i would suggest getting in somewhere between five and ten miles in a workout there will be days when you will want to focus on other things and will get in less but look to that as a goal nothing beats just getting out on the road and running unless it is a trail however for hill training you might want to consider going to a local high school and running up and down the football stadium stairs this would be one of those days where you do not get in long distances race up the stairs and use the down as a recovery this will help with uphill climbs but won't do that much for downhill technique i would suggest running five to six days a week i know people who run seven days a week but i never could keep that up for very long i always wanted needed at least one day off however if you are serious about x country you will want to get in the miles and workout at least five days a week for the most part i suggest not worrying about how fast you are running but do make sure you are pushing yourself the initial goal should be to build up your base miles especially during the off season as you get stronger your speed will naturally increase once you get into the season your coach will be working with you to improve however one thing you could do is pick a course three mile five miles what ever and time yourself use that as a base and then as you run do a personal time trial periodically to see if you can improve your time some days you will some days you won't but that can serve as a barometer on how your training is going the other thing about how fast is that it is dependant on your conditioning and natural ability i have no way of telling how fast your really may be but i suspect you have lots of room for improvement my guess is that you can probably work that min mi for three miles down to minutes fairly quickly but again right now pre season just concentrate on base miles good luck  Cross-country skiing Toyota Prius Weight training Eventing Norway national football team Carolina Panthers Triathlon Mountain bike Marathon (sport) Drag racing Fell running Paragliding Gliding Cincinnati Bengals San Francisco 49ers Extreme Programming TGV Ben Johnson (athlete) CPU cache Alex Ferguson Baseball Dog agility Auto racing Troms__ I.L.

how long should my runnign stride be i am ' and about pounds when i am running on a grass trail in a park how long should my stride be your stride should be what is natural for you do not try to run with a longer stride if someone says a longer stride means you are running faster that is not necessarily true your foot should contact the ground only slightly in front of you and the foot is moving rearward at the speed you are moving forward so it does not feel like it is in front of you running is a pushing motion not a pulling motion so do not reach out in front to lengthen your stride if you are running on a trail keep scanning the ground in front so you do not step in a hole or on a rock or tree branch if you are running on the track or street you can scan much farther ahead when you are running up hill you will shorten your stride and when you are running down hill the stride will lengthen but you must be careful not to over run yourself coming downhill relax your arms and keep your elbows at degrees and swing your arms front to back do not let them cross your body so that you swing the arms side to side which will cause you to twist your body to answer your question about how long your stride should be there is no answer in feet and inches regardless of your height or leg length  Equine conformation Horse gait Swingout Fast bowling Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling throws Cross-country skiing Backstroke Swimming Chair Aerial (dance move) Suplex Softball Boxing Breaststroke Show hunter Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Pole vault Internal ballistics Anatomical terms of location Professional wrestling aerial techniques Skateboarding trick Butterfly stroke Professional wrestling attacks Horse Dressage Car handling Wing Chun Sailing Marching band Drill bit Glossary of American football Laws of cricket Horizontal bar Charleston (dance move) Rail terminology M16 (rifle) Glossary of ballet terms Lindy Basic Cricket Glossary of partner dance terms Dog agility DDT (professional wrestling) Contredanse Erie Canal Punch (strike) Glossary of climbing terms Side pass (dance move) Baseball Balboa (dance) Drag racing Biped Bicycle Batting (cricket) Sling (weapon) Golf Show jumping Lawn mower Pushing hands Casualty lifting Tyrannosaurus rex Parade (military) Clean and jerk Trot (horse gait) Rugby union Mark I (tank) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Sugar push Heckler & Koch G3 Speed of light The Time Machine Field hockey Black hole Rugby union positions Virginia Opossum Action potential Mouse (computing) Hurdling Zeno's paradoxes Textile manufacturing Stairway Strap-on dildo Manual transmission Railroad switch Jazz dance moves Diving Roller coaster Punt (boat)

why do my legs start to itch when i start running or jogging on the treadmill i recently started working out and i noticed that sometimes when i start jogging my legs start to itch really bad i was told it was my sudden adrenaline boost and the rushing of my blood if this is the case how do i stop it from happening like i said it happens sometimes i usually happens if i power walk first and then start to run if i just start off running it doesn't usually happen this is fairly common for some to have an itching in their legs soon after they begin running or walking i think it has more to do with blood circulating it is not serious and it will not continue forever  Running Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Professional wrestling slang Episodes of Lost (Season 2) 1957 World Series Kaliyan The Inside Memorial Stadium, Clemson Myocardial infarction Eczema Horse gait Equine conformation The Shining (film) Epinephrine Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Kodocha The Amazing Race Urticaria Shock Horse Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Escape from New York The Joker's Wild Social rule The Contender (television series) Cardiac arrhythmia Pok__mon Live!

how can i make myself enjoy running i've heard people say that they love to run why i would love to enjoy it more because it would be so so so good for me start running all the time it's like potato chips i could go a year without eating one but once i do i'll want to eat more same with running if you don't run you won't feel a need or want to do it but once you start running for like weeks straight you'll turn it into a habit this isn't a good analogy because it would take more than just one jog to get you hooked whereas with potato chips you'd only have to eat one but you get the point a good way to get started is to run the same distance everyday and use a stop watch track your times and you'll want to beat them when you notice you've been running in shorter times as time goes on it will encourage you to keep running and give you something to look forward to it will be like answering the what's in it for me  Poker jargon Potato Shaggy dog story Boxing The Amazing Race Friends Potato chips Ben Johnson (athlete) Running Drag racing New York Giants Kodocha Hiberno-English Fecal incontinence Social rule The Joker's Wild The Ashlee Simpson Show English grammar Trailer Park Boys Kender Shit Knots Landing Fish and chips Sprint (race) She Loves You Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Taikyoku shogi Game show Snooker The Time Machine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Current teachings of Prem Rawat New Zealand English Dorama Maka dai dai shogi Milton H.

sprained ankle yesterday while running in the woods i rolled my ankle on a root i landed on the outside of the ankle and it hurt for about a minute and then my coach camp counselor who was with me told me it was best to keep running in order to keep the blood circulating after hobbling for a few steps i regained a semi normal stride and finished the mile run at a fast pace i iced somewhat and elevated but i had a six hour van ride later that day and mostly my ankle was kept still not really taken care of today i have a day off from running but this morning i woke up with extremely limited range of motion in my ankle i have to walk with my foot turned outward in order to be able to move at all it is as if my achilles tendon is also affected even though only the outer ankle is swollen it is as if my achilles will not bend fully in order to let me walk normally what the heck is wrong with my ankle and when will it get better should i ice it or heat it i think you were given some terrible advice to keep going in june i was at the gym at an outdoor fitness class and i rolled my ankle on a pebble i rolled it on the inside and the outside i sat down immediately and they went and got some ice i went straight to urgent care and it turned out i had partially torn ligaments they put my foot in an immobilizer for weeks and then i stepped down to a small brace as i need it now when i go to the gym or riding bikes with my kids etc the one thing that the dr told me is that when i rolled my ankle the worst thing i could have done is to keep going your body has been injured and it sends you signals pain inflammation and swelling you should have stayed off of it and immediately iced it you need to go see an orthopedic specialist as soon as you can and no more running until you do i hope you didn't make it worse by running on an injured foot do not heat it heat makes inflammation worse not better icing it every min to an hour and staying off of it will help also taking ibuprofen advil mg twice a day will help with the swelling and the pain i still have trouble walking flat footed without my brace and it has been weeks going down stairs is very hard it takes time and lots of taking care of it if you ever want to be able to have the physical ability you had prior to your injury today if i were you i would find an urgent care center and go see a dr then make an appt with a specialist on monday  Equine conformation Professional wrestling holds Osteoarthritis Carpal tunnel syndrome Aerial (dance move) Pain Iliotibial band syndrome Weight training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.

if im thinking about joining my hs xc running team do i need to get sum trail shoes i was thinking along the lines of an asics or saucany shoe yes generally there should be a movable back heel so you get more grip on the ground and it moves with the different terrain to help keep you stable if you're running in that kind of environment like hiking trails and stuff it should be fine if you're running on more flat ground they might be too heavy i would switch to a more cushioned and lighter weight shoe just make sure you find a heel cup to hold your foot in place so you don't roll your ankle  Skateboarding trick Equine conformation High-heeled shoe Professional wrestling holds Hiking Casualty lifting Rugby union Snowboarding Fast bowling Aerial (dance move) Badminton Sailing Trail Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Marching band Railroad switch Glossary of climbing terms Lindy Basic Billiards Backpacking (wilderness) Punt (boat) Snowboard Bicycle Ski Kurt Angle Professional wrestling attacks Rail terminology Irish dance Car handling Trapping Suplex Professional wrestling throws Anchor Professional wrestling slang Cross-country skiing Swingout Figure skating Glossary of American football Running National Football League Lore Contredanse Volleyball Parachuting Glossary of partner dance terms Mountain bike Foot Tennessee Walker Tap dance Tire Golf Softball Fencing Horse gait Footwear Mouse (computing) Boot Horse Clean and jerk All-terrain vehicle Knife Inflation Tennis Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Roller skating Flat feet Snowshoe Telemark skiing Bass drum Skateboard Skateboarding Paragliding Mattress Trail running Horseshoe Pickup truck Long Path Mechanical advantage Canadian football Narrow gauge Iliotibial band syndrome Reebok Trail blazing Death Valley National Park Glossary of ballet terms Kokoda Track Campaign Armored Core Iditarod Parade (military) Empire Burlesque Peleliu Triathlon Chair Charles Ashenoff 1957 World Series Broomball Recumbent bicycle Appalachian Trail Opportunity rover

recommend any good running shoes for shin splints i've had them for months and im looking to buy a new pair of running shoes hoping that it will eliminate the problem thanks so much to those who answer this is hopefully the first of many monthly articles contributed to my friends at running unlimited in palatine and to all of you runners out there recreational or competitive senior citizen or high school age running is not just a sport it can be a way of life unfortunately there can and always will be injuries which occur throughout your life as a result of participation by becoming more knowledgeable about ways to prevent and recognize injuries and conditions you'll be spending more time on the road and less time on the couch first off here in the midwest we have been blessed by some tremendous running weather over the past few weeks unfortunately it will soon be getting colder remind yourself a longer period of time is needed for adequate warm up of your muscle tendon tissues

biomechanical abnormalities pain along the inside of the lower shins may develop medial tibial stress syndrome shin splints accounts for of running injuries although the exact causes of this condition are unknown it is believed a variety of factors such as involved when shin pain the ones listed previously may be arrives one must look at what varying factors are at play are you just beginning running are your shoes over worn are you over training do you have flat feet if you do you simply may need new shoes or even orthopedic inserts orthotics each of these factors must be questioned and by deductive reasoning figure out which changes can be made next it is imperative to begin treating yourself for the pain and inflammation applying ice packs to the affected area three to four times each day especially immediately following a workout seems to help it is also advised that you alter your workouts by either shortening the duration and reducing the intensity of the workouts and or changing the training surface to grass or a cushioned track with permission from parents or your physician antiinflammatories such as ibuprofen may help decrease the pain and inflammation as well if pain persists with no improvements regardless of training changes and proper treatments a visit to the physician is in order to rule out a stress fracture or other serious condition as with any injury the best form of treatment is prevention obtaining a properly fitted shoe and or insert is the first and most important step going through a complete warm up procedure which includes stretches of the ankle and lower leg musculature should be the norm vary days of your heavy and light workouts and follow each with a cool down and stretching session preventative icing or cold whirlpool treatments following a heavy workout may help as well good luck and until next time keep on truckin' this is the best advice you'll ever get regarding running shoes go to a real running store and tell them just what you wrote here now i'm not talking about a store in the mall that has guys that dress like referees or about big box sporting goods stores i mean stores that only cater to runners they have the knowledge the experience and the selection to get you what you need these good folks will be able to tell what sort of foot strike and gait you have bring your old shoes and they can analyze the wear pattern they'll even watch you walk and run to get a better idea and you shouldn't expect to pay much more than you would at a mall store heck with a budget of you can get the top of the line but

what kind of running shoes should i buy to prevent runners knee read to details i got my first pay check today and cross country season is about to start so i am going to buy running shoes last season i felt no pain in my knees but this year after a run i feel pain so what kind of shoes should i buy can either tell me the name of the shoes like air max or tell me the type like the shpae of the shoes less arch like that the name of the shoes would help a lot i know i have knee pain and it hurts like yeah the answer is this buy nice shoes firstly in order to prevent runner's knee and other pains you need good cushion make sure yours shoes are nice and provide elite cushion secondly it is possible to buy the nicest cushioned shoes but still have knee pains this is because the shoe might not fit you properly your best chance is a specialty running store where they find out the size of your arch and foot so that they can get a shoe accordingly if you have a small arch and buy a shoe with a large one you are in trouble because even though they might be comfortable they would be painful overall remember to get shoes that fit your foot and provide proper cushion durability and stability stability is another factor obviously don't go nike shox nike shox look amazing and yes they are cool but don't' wear them for running they are so elevated in the heel that it makes it hard for them to be as stable as other shoes i prefer asics asics provide good cushion for me and make shoes that adequately fit my foot i currently own the asics gel kayano and if you have a medium to low arch need cushioning and want a strong shoe maybe you should purchase them asic's is better than some other brands in my opinion because they cater specifically to runners any kind of asic's shoe that is on their upper end should be good for your feet other decent brands include mizuno saucony brooks and nike good luck  Equine conformation High-heeled shoe Shoe Mattress Nike, Inc.

what drills and stuff should i practice to be a better runner i mean to raise endurance and run faster i gues increasing my stride to intervals these are workouts that kill but trust me they work it all depends on what you are trianing for sprinting intervals will work on holding you top speed for a longer tme however you cannot run for a long time one day do a pyramid of m this is considered your endurance work out run these distances at approx then try to jog back if you can't don't worry just walk you'll be able to jog soon as you get better you ca increase the distance but don't go higher than m you can do the pyramid times as you get stronger for your speed work out is run m at appox to full start at times and then do't excede x then run m at full on a slightly up hill x up to x then run slightly down hill for m at full for the same amount of time the down hill will get you to be able to control your self at higher speed but do not go so fast that you go out of control for mid distance m m this will get you to hold a very fast pase for longer but not quite as fast run a pyramid do not excede m you could also do a and do that or times same walk or jog the equal distance for speed run m at x to x you can get up to m but do not excede x then m up hill at full and then m down hill at full x then for long distance training endurance day is m you can get up to m or you could run m x all at and walk or jog back an equal distance for speed you can do m at time then m up hill full x then m slightly down hill full speed x thesework outs will allow you to run longer distances with some speed but not as much as the previous then there is cros country intervas these are the worst but they help your endurance you ned to find a place that has a couple hills ands that you can figre out the distances you can start these on the track but they cannot be all on the track find a lap that is m small m med m large and then m extra largemake syre there is a sizable hill in atleast the extralarge and a small one at least in all the others when i say small i mean fairly small then do different combinations with these curcuits ex sm med lg xlg or sm lg xlg sm or med lg sm xlg you can figure out what is best for you i recomend walking the first couple of weks of doig this after completeing circuit approx m you can jog once you get used to it then for speed you can do the long distance speed work out these work out wil allow you to go on very long runs and your endurace will be very good but your speed may not be just choose the program that you want the results from before any of these work outs do a proper warm uo tis is crutal becuase these work outs are very hard on you bady and injuring your self will happen if you do not warm up and streych properly a good warm up would be finding a m bit and doing the following exersies with a jog or skip back do each execise x front skip with fowrard arm circles same with back arm circles skip with arms at degrees and swinging arms at degrees and coming across you cest to your back grape vine facing ne side one pass and then facing the other side the next time kareoka front leg comes high across the other leg higher than grapevine both sides front kick lunges a march a skip a run your arms at and you kee come up so that your thight is parrallel with the ground but kickers b skip a skip but you leg extends side shuffle both sides backward skip it is akward then front skip you can add different excersises just ake sure that your entire body is moving wen stretchig ensre that you stretch at the very least your calves to prevent shin splints hamstrings and quads i would recomend more stretching it really helps after endurance work outs no matter what speed ou choose run hills find a long steep hill run that sprint x mid dis x long x and then xcountry these numbers can all be changed to what suts you then start half way up and sprint them sprinting mid long xc again umbers can al be changed and increase these are base numberbecuase these are for base and strength it will not afect your speed the long hil should be between m and the little hil should be steep but actually only m sorry that i said half way for a god challange and hard work out run sand hills and if you are in a large building run stairs to increase you stride length skip stairs other drill that you can do to in crease speed and stride length are stright leg bounds bounding and acceleation make a starting line then make a line m from ther and be at full speed by that make and hold it for another m or so i hope that this help and there a lot more workout and drills on the internet god luck  Fast bowling Aerial (dance move) Swingout Weight training Volleyball Butterfly stroke Horse gait Breaststroke

is a k in cross country hard what is an average finishing time in a k i ran my first xc race in over a year last year it was a km for junior girl i was times are so hard to judge in xc becuase the courses are so different the only way you can compar is running on the same course or coparing it to other people in the race you were in i ran or races last year and only races were on the same course the reason why it changes so much is the hills and the different terriane hills make it far more difficult thee for adding time and it the course if mudding wet and slippery it may add time but you should wear spike to make both the terane and hill easier to take because it gives you a lot of grip for example i passed two people right before the finish line becuase they didn't have spikes and they sliped and fell in mud trying to run a hill on averge i ran between min depending on the course and i am not a very good long distance runner i am a spriter so you'll robably do better than me every one has good day and every one has bad days so don't be too worried about your time in xc places is what matter but as a bigginer don't be too worried about that either before every race just say i want to run harder becuase if you say i want to beat that person and you don't you'll get dissapointed or if you say i want to run a certian time and you hit a hill and it was harder on you than expected you won't be dissaointed run you first race hard get used to what is going on and then strive to run harder becuase especially in cross country every course and eveyr race is totally different good luck  Cross-country skiing Fell running Fast bowling Cross country running Tire Theory of conduct Social rule Olympic medalists in athletics (men) Drag racing Marathon (sport) Paula Radcliffe The Amazing Race Lake Speed Indianapolis 500 Paragliding Softball Ty Cobb 2000 Australian Grand Prix Bubble Bobble Dog agility Tour de France Equine conformation In The Groove (game) Boston Marathon Canada at the 2004 Summer Olympics Craps Anchor Golf Triathlon Norway national football team Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics Gliding Hal Trosky Tenshinhan 24 Hours of Le Mans New York Giants Aerial (dance move) International League Chris Amon Baseball statistics CPU cache 2005 Iditarod Mountaineering Wave Race: Blue Storm Penske Racing Laws of cricket Pump It Up Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Hurdling The Great Race (Care Bears) Time Out of Mind Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Tony Stewart Peachtree Road Race Bon Jovi Torquay United F.C.

getting a better mile time treadmill i have a treadmill and was wondering how to decrease my minute mile time to like min what are some workouts to do on the treadmill how fast should i go any incline thanks if you're preparing for a faster mile outside if you put the treadmill incline on that is more comparable to running in the outside elements if your goal is just to improve your mile time on the treadmill i've found that increasing the speed either each workout for example run at setting on tues setting on thurs until you get to your goal time or you can increase your speed during your workout if you're feeling good you can start out at and every of a mile just bump up the pace a bit good luck and run fast  Weight training Heart rate Fast bowling RISC Triathlon Equine conformation CPU design 24 Hours of Le Mans Treadmill Equation of time Central processing unit Cardiac stress test Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) CPU cache Marathon (sport) Speed reading Sonic the Hedgehog Zoom (comics) TGV Flash (comics) 2000 Australian Grand Prix USS Uhlmann (DD-687) High-speed rail CDC 6600 Toyota Prius STS-97 Data General Nova INMOS Transputer Indianapolis 500 Heinkel He 100 Baseball Stars Dog agility Personal rapid transit Galactic Civilizations Hipparchus (astronomer) Messerschmitt Me 163 Welding Jet engine Hash table STS-61 Cray-2 Tank classification Cardiac arrhythmia Civilization III B-47 Stratojet Redundant array of independent disks Mitsubishi Zero Space Shuttle program Speed of light Recumbent bicycle Angina Quicksort Engine Valentino Rossi M4 Sherman Mountain bike Modem M240 Pentium 4 Horse gait STS-62 Tempo Motility Tyrannosaurus rex Seabiscuit Cray-1 Apollo 16 Tenshinhan Athlon Breaststroke Bubble Bobble Interstate Highway Milton H.

im good at short distance running and i want to improve in long distances how do i do this i don't know how much you run to begin with but i would start of by running days a week with a mile mile rotation if you are in shape monday through friday do this for two weeks and then progress yourself to a mile mile rotation with another on saturday always hydrate constantly long distant running in the summer will burn numerous calories as well as dehydrate you try running in the early mornings and late evenings to avoid the heat make sure you have a good set of cross country running shoes which can be purchased at most local sporting good stores don't put more than miles on one pair of shoes if you begin to have pain in your workouts ease off a bit walk some and then try running again if the pain is reoccurring you need to knock your mileage back down some becoming a better runner is not about running as fast as you can for as long as you can run one or two days a week with an increased amount of speed take the day following the speed workouts with a slower pace and then allow yourself or days to run a generally moderate pace if you are running in a hilly area you might want to decrease your mileage a bit and run hills depending on the hill size will dictate how many hills you should run always warm up and stretch before running and do a post work out cool down walk and stretch being limber is a vital part of running long distance especially on uneven terrain hope this helps and good luck with the running  Marathon (sport) Weight training Triathlon Equine conformation Hiking Fast bowling Swimming Jet engine Carburetor Running Welding Tire Interstate Highway Internal ballistics Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Indianapolis 500 Fasting Tank Drag racing Breastfeeding Energy Stress fracture Recumbent bicycle Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Fell running Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Paragliding E85 Horse gait Drill bit Disc brake CPU design Explosive material John McDouall Stuart USS Tunny (SS-282) Dog agility Gliding Iliotibial band syndrome Gas metal arc welding Ben Johnson (athlete) Iditarod Sprint (race) Mercury (planet) Sport rowing Bicycle Speed limit 24 Hours of Le Mans 2003 North America blackout Port Authority Trans-Hudson Hybrid Synergy Drive Portland cement Heinkel He 100 Hybrid vehicle Freeway Day TGV Action potential Future energy development Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Speed of light 1957 World Series CPU cache Diesel engine RISC Geography of Russia Wind turbine 400-Series Highways Billboard Hot 100 STS-62 Elis Prefecture Dieting Diving 2000 Australian Grand Prix Auto racing Babe Ruth Toyota Prius Softball Easter Dairy Energy development Nuclear power Fanny Blankers-Koen Horseshoe Auto insurance USS Ammen (DD-527) Marching band Bubble Bobble Cleveland Browns Inflation Olympic medalists in athletics (men) Athletics Soap opera Sauna Daylight saving time

can running walking make my thighs and calves more muscular i want to tone my legs and make them thinner by running walking but i'm afraid it will make my calves and thighs will look even bigger becasue of muscle aerobic exercise is unlikely to build bulky muscles and likely to reduce body fat otoh doing leg presses with very heavy weights where you can only do reps before your legs give out that will build muscle bulk the difference is in the number or reps and the amount of weight being cycled in the former you're doing thousands of reps with only your normal body weight and as well you're not doing deep pressing movements  Weight training Muscle Duchenne muscular dystrophy Dieting Urinary incontinence Puberty Aerobic exercise Insulin Triathlon Strap-on dildo Diving Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tyrannosaurus rex Muay Thai Physical attractiveness Horse Bodybuilding Becker's muscular dystrophy Dairy Professional wrestling throws Stretching Deep vein thrombosis Massage Professional wrestling holds Hip (anatomy) Squat (exercise) Elephant Body type (exercise) Atherosclerosis Soleus muscle Milton H.

should i start running again after picking up a manual labour job well i practiced the fun sport of running for most of the school year until this summer when i landed a full time job at an electric motor warehouse by the end of the day i was very tired from all the lifting and moving product around and decided to stop running the main reason was that i was burning enough calories doing heavy work than when i ran the only problem i have is with my cardio i run up a set of stairs and i sometimes have to catch my breath at the top this never used to happen when i ran the same goes for walking around at a brisk pace should i start up again even though i am dead tired and just want to sleep at the end of the day any ideas would be appreciated thanks a short run should be great i find that if i do a work out it is something i am doing for me work is something i do because i have to for money if you are really tire take an nap and also look at you diet make sure you are getting enough calories for all of the activity you are doing it sounds to me like you are into what your body needs and is capable of so push as hard as you think you can i know this you can always stop running it is difficult to pick it up again once you have stopped  1957 World Series Drag racing Fast bowling Dieting 2000 Australian Grand Prix Aerial (dance move) Carburetor Sleep Skateboarding trick Baseball Labour economics Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Volleyball Motorcycle Bodybuilding STS-61 Equine conformation Manual transmission Indianapolis 500 Fire fighting Escape from New York IBM PC compatible Social rule Breastfeeding Car handling Lawn mower Marathon (sport) Atkins Nutritional Approach Mountain bike Babe Ruth Hitchhiking Rail terminology Shaggy dog story Elevator Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ernie Irvan Avenue Q Dog agility 24 Hours of Le Mans Energy Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling slang Rugby union Toyota Prius Auto racing Fanny Blankers-Koen The Time Machine Syphon Filter Blood (computer game) 2005 United States Grand Prix Chevrolet Camaro Low-carbohydrate diet Dead Like Me Game programming Unemployment Avalanche Dodge Charger Marching band Volkswagen Golf Recumbent bicycle Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Truck Paul Is Dead The Shining (film) Tai Chi Chuan Tag Weight training Super Size Me Drowning Bristol Grammar School Pitaten Ford Mustang Thermal power station Windows XP Peleliu The Dalek Invasion of Earth Bicycle Butterfly stroke Calorie Formula One regulations Business process reengineering Troy Glaus Football (soccer) Canadian Tire NASCAR Swimming Movie projector Frogman Explosive material Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Drifting (motorsport) Life extension Siesta Mach kernel Diving Cricket Mitsubishi 3000GT Electric motor Wind turbine Heinkel He 100

why does my left foot go numb while running not my entire foot just my small toes it usually happens around minutes into my run and progressively gets worse i'm assuming it's my shoes because i didn't have this problem with my last pair however the shoes feel quite loose on me so maybe i tie the laces a little to tight to compensate for it is it okay to wear the laces a little loose or will that lead to other problems anyone else ever have this problem maybe i need a shoe with a larger toe box your shoes are probably too tight cutting off your circulation and resulting in numbing this is a common problem for runners who begin to run long distances what most people do not realize that is that your feet tend to swell after running a few miles i run marathons and my shoes are about a size larger than their resting fit while your shoes should fit snugly it should not feel tight also your laces should be worn loosely but snugly if this simple remedy does not work then you may have a bigger concern on your hands and you should get it checked out  Sock Equine conformation Shoe High-heeled shoe Boxing Triathlon Glossary of partner dance terms National Football League Lore Diabetic neuropathy Undergarment Diving Poker jargon 1957 World Series Glossary of climbing terms Mattress Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics Stocking Marathon (sport) Athletics Pointe shoes Textile manufacturing Upholstery Marching band Hal Trosky Second Battle of the Atlantic Collision detection Carpal tunnel syndrome Figure skating Fast bowling Multiple sclerosis Irish dance Stairway Leggings Baseball American football Rugby union positions Rifle Foot Mixed martial arts The Wall Tightlacing Drill bit Snowboard Recumbent bicycle New York Giants Running Softball Super Bowl XIII Hamster Internal ballistics Speaker of the British House of Commons Glossary of American football Strap-on dildo Olympic medalists in athletics (men) Community emergency response team Footwear Black tie Berimbau Iliotibial band syndrome Massage Skinhead Roller skating Blackjack Kilt Necktie Callus Straitjacket Boston and Lowell Railroad Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Mach kernel Climbing equipment Zeno's paradoxes Snowshoe Trail running Corset Japanese tea ceremony Drag racing Heinkel He 100 Fell running Operation Market Garden Badminton Customs and etiquette of Japan Comparison of Canadian and American football Battle of Spotsylvania Court House Bondage (BDSM) Boot Sprint (race) Mercury 4 Mouse (computing) Diabetic retinopathy The Big Bopper Car handling Horse gait Electrophysiology Paula Radcliffe Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Tsunami Shoe size Turbocharger

mp or ipod for running i've been using this little yet handy mp player for the past year it's like mb and i currently have about songs that are now stuck there for life as the little drive thing is corrupted i'm definitly getting something new but i was wondering about opinions the best winning pts lol whether ot not i should go for an ipod or just a high mem capacity mp player i'm not too into the video portion of what ipods can offer so maybe there are some other stuff to it than that like my buddy telling me that you can track run progress and upload it from ipod to computer any insights would be great for running i recommend an ipod nano its small and portable yet you can store a good amount of songs still plus like mentioned before you can get a convenient arm band for it another nice thing about the ipod nano is that nike has a special thing that you can store in their special nike shoes you dont have to have their shoes for it you can also store those things behind your heel in your socks and itll wireless transfer information to you ipod giving it information about your run if you go to an apple store or check the website nike site you can probably find good amounts of information on it and see whether you like the ipod or not  IPod ITunes IPod shuffle USB flash drive Digital audio player IPod mini Podcasting Walkman FireWire ITunes Music Store FairPlay PlayStation Portable IPod photo Redundant array of independent disks Disc jockey IMac Creative Zen Floppy disk MP3 Digital rights management Apple Macintosh Compact audio cassette Flash memory Online music store Mobile phone MiniDisc American Pie (song) Gramophone record H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Mixtape BitTorrent Apple II family DVD Nike, Inc.
