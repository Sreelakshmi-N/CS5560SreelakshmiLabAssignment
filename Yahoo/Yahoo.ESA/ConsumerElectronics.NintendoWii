mario party or zelda i like multi player games but i like deep games too so which one do i get ummmm i wholeheartedly agree that mario party is a copy of the previously released versions however i want to mention that the following aspects have to be taken into consideration millions of consoles have been sold the wii remote the fact the wii is enjoyable for non gamers the wii's game audience will include hundreds of thousands of players around the world who are buying a console for the first time they possibly have never played mario party at all this game will be exciting and fun for them especially with friends having picked it up last night i invited other friends over and we played a full round of the first board it was fun we tried to gang up on each other and steal peoples coins in full mario party fashion so while i agree that the games are not all unique and new i must say at least nintendo ported over the most important portion of mario party the fun factor this game will be whole heartedly enjoyed by the new wii owners who have never experienced mario party not to mention fans out there who may have only owned of the previous versions for the wii this is the best party game released so far on par with rayman raving rabbids hardcore gamers or mario party fantatics may want to rent this game and play a round before jumping out and buying it overall the controls were ok and the games fun and you and your friends will have a lot of fun not to mention laughs  The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Super Mario remake series Nintendo Mario Nintendo DS Nintendo 64 Super Mario Bros.

what are good wii games for a yr old boy for a birthday gift any others beside wii play some that are easy for him to follow and possibly a learning type game mario zelda and such deal with story i don't think he can play and understand you've got to be kidding me you all sound as if the wii has all those violent games for older people it's geared toward everyone i know most wii games are for older children but i'm sure there are at least one or two games out there meant for learning for his age vtech and others have learning type games of their own for his age so this is nothing new and no i don't expect him to sit him all day in front to play it conclusions conclusions btw i know this is nothing new but why answer if you don't have one that helps the question keep your rude comments to yourselves they arent' helpful my niece is turning next month and after playing wii sports with me at my house my brother decided to buy one for them they recently got a shrek game that she can play and really enjoys i tried to help her learn several of my games like cooking mama elebits zelda paper mario etc but they were too involved we found that if we play mario party along with her it's set up like a board game with mini games and we practice the mini games before we play them for real she can follow along fairly well granted we are helping her along at this point because she can't read but she has a great time and it's nice to have the grown ups playing with her it makes her happy also she has been able to play warioware warioware is a game full of minigames we picked which games we thought she could handle trying and then let her go at it she is able to do a pretty fair amount of them because they are simple and grouped well they put them into groups of how you use the wiimote like turning it spinning it twisting it etc it helps them learn how to do one motion with the wiimote well and it enforces it by having them to that motion over and over in different ways super monkey ball banana blast is ok it has less mini games that she is able to do and some are a little more sensitive and complicated but if you can't find anything else it is plausible it can be a little frustrating because as a parent of a child the same age i'm sure you know they want to play all the ones you know are too complicated for them but it isn't a total loss and as a side note you can't underestimate these little kids with the wiimotes my niece at and months was consistently bowling over in wii bowling it drove us crazy she'd just wing her arm and get a strike almost every time so really you never know what they are capable of until they get some practice i guess  The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Wario Computer and video game genres Link (Legend of Zelda) Nintendo Theory of conduct Kodocha Table tennis Video game music Animal Crossing Shaggy dog story The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening Aerial (dance move) Laws of cricket New York Giants Samus Aran The Legend of Zelda series Boss (video games) Volleyball Nintendo GameCube Wheel of Fortune Super Mario Bros.

do nintendo ds games work with a nintendo wii i've just bought a wii for my son's birthday someone told me that either ds games or xbox games will work with the wii in addition to the games made specifically for wii is this right will i need any different controls to work the games other than the wii mote thank you you can't put a ds game into the wii but there are some games like pokemon diamond and pearl that lets you upload game saves to the wii basically with pokemon battle revolution instead of using the pokemon that are included in the game you can upload pokemon that you caught and trained from the ds games pokemon diamond and pokemon pearl to do battle in pokemon battle revolution i think the person got confused with gamecube games and ds games the wii can play all gamecube games also with the gamecube it was possible to get the gamecube player which attaches to the bottom of the gamecube and from there you can play gameboy games on the tv  Pok__mon (video games) Pok__mon Nintendo GameCube Nintendo Revolution Game Boy Pok__mon XD: Gale of Darkness Game controller Game Boy Advance Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Nintendo Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo DS The Sims Computer and video games Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Pok__mon Colosseum Pok__mon Trading Card Game Action Replay Xbox Animal Crossing Pok__mon Emerald Bubble Bobble Pok__mon Stadium Dance Dance Revolution Console game The Legend of Zelda series Tetris Attack Resident Evil (video game) Phantasy Star Online Pok__mon Crystal Video game console Boss (video games) PlayStation 2 Pok__mon Yellow Computer role-playing game Super Nintendo Entertainment System Resident Evil 2 Modchip Nintendo 64 Missingno.

wii console getting kinda slow i have a nintendo wii and have the first channel screen filled with icons and a few saved game data games i have noticed that when i return to the main screen its taking a lot longer than it use to and sometimes when i start a channel like photo it can take nearly just to start up meanwhile all i see is a black screen i am aware its not the powerhouse of console's but anyone else have any details btw fantastic console i've got all the available channels games downloaded and i've never encountered this trouble i've had mine since launch and never had one single problem out of it i'd call up nintendo and ask them about it they do have good customer support if you registered your wii they extended the warranty on it so if you haven't done it yet register it at www nintendo com either way be sure to call and find out it is toll free so you don't have anything but time to loose  Game Boy Super Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo 64 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Nintendo Nintendo DS Nintendo Revolution Handheld game console PlayStation Portable Xbox PlayStation 2 Nintendo GameCube Super Mario Bros. 3 RISC TurboGrafx 16 Game Boy Advance PlayStation 3 Advance Wars: Dual Strike Pok__mon (video games) Sega Master System Nintendo Power Video game music The Sims 2 Xbox 360 Super Mario 64 PC Engine Final Fantasy VI Final Fantasy (video game) Computer role-playing game Video game console Mozilla Firefox N-Gage Commodore 64 Sega Saturn Super Mario Bros.

hi has anyone played resident evil on original gamecube before if you have please answer my question ok there is a question in the beginning of the game the question is which best describes your opinion about games i mountain climbing beyond the hardships lies accomplishment ii hiking the destination can be reached rather comfortably ok the questions are they a trick questions please let me know also one more thing when i kill a zombie why does the same zombie comes back to live becomes more damn power scary what is the best way to kill the zombie for good do i blow the heads off thanks guys ladies mountain climbing sets the game to hard mode hiking sets it in easy mode and they come back to life like that because they are the prestage of the licker if you have ever played resident evil or seen the resident evil movie the licker is the thing with the long tongue well after the zombie dies it turns into a crimson head with long nails and super speed and ven though the game does not show this after a crimson head dies it mutates into a licker interesting huh it is the evolutionary pattern of the t virus and there is no way to kill a zombie for good because they willjust wake up fierce and quick so just try to shoot them and when they fall run past them there is a chance it did not die and is best to keep them that way better to run into a zombie than a crimson head right lol  Resident Evil (film) Resident Evil (video game) Resident Evil Blood (computer game) Resident Evil 2 Paul W.

ps xbox or wii what gamesystem is the best i think it's ps i'm totally biased towards nintendo but i'll try to break out of that for this review p wii innovation new method of getting in the game with the wiimote nunchuk and motion sensitivity so so although very good looking no matter what the specs say graphics hardware notice the word hardware the stuff on screen can look good with the wii's hardware too no homebrew compatibility yet i'm hoping no dvd cd playback again hopefully that's a yet opera web browser with flash you can watch youtube videos with it classic nintendo series of games i just finished started over played through again legend of zelda twilight princess although it's my first zelda game it's probably my favorite game ever xbox for the more hardcore gamer halo halo halo good graphics and graphics hardware hdtv support built in hard drive no blu ray but who really needs blu ray it's a waste of money xbox live though it costs money per month wii's online is free is supposed to be good ps playstation for the more hardcore gamer as well but with a side of expensive uselessness all my friends hate it and they aren't all nintendo like i am although it has the ultra powerful cell processor the blu ray was overkill and the price is way high the controllers lack rumble packs but are wireless and have accelerometers like the wiimote but the form factor limits the usefulness of the ps motion sensing i've heard there aren't many good games but i don't look at ps 's much i mean any i'd definitely say get a wii but it's really a personal choice review them carefully but don't rule the wii out on system specs alone loz looked really good graphically and it was designed for the cube also remember that hdtv support is downright useless on an sdtv so if you're planning on using an xb or ps on your average bedroom tv you aren't going to get the most out of the expensive graphics hardware  Computer and video games Sega Dreamcast PlayStation 3 PlayStation 2 Nintendo DS Video game music ATI Technologies Sega Saturn Handheld game console High-definition television Nintendo Entertainment System PlayStation Portable Game Boy Advance Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis History of computer and video games Game controller The Legend of Zelda series Super Nintendo Entertainment System Console game Final Fantasy NVIDIA PowerPC Console wars Modchip Windows Vista Game Boy Windows XP Universal Serial Bus Atari 8-bit family IBM PC compatible Radeon The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Halo (video game series) Link (Legend of Zelda) Halo 2 Doom 3 Wipeout (game) Game Critics Awards Apple Macintosh Halo: Combat Evolved Counter-Strike Amiga First-person shooter ZX Spectrum Grand Theft Auto III Microsoft Intellivision Sega CD History of video games (Sixth generation era) Sony Computer Entertainment Super Mario 64 Computer and video games that have been considered the greatest ever Atari 2600 Commodore 64 The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Mac OS X Game programming Machinima The Sims FIFA Series Windows 2000 Regional lockout Timeline of computing 1990-forward N-Gage Rare (video game company) IPod History of video games (32-bit / 64-bit era) GamePark Computer role-playing game The Sims 2 Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting USB flash drive Atari ST Zelda II: The Adventure of Link IMac Yu Suzuki DVD The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess DualShock Nintendo Virtual Boy GeForce 6 Series Personal computer The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Resident Evil (video game) The Legend of Zelda TurboGrafx 16 Copy protection

if you buy the wii ds usb adapter what else do you need i have a broadband connection with a modem and a computer running windows xp and is it a good buy i personally would say buy a wifi router they're affordable these days for a basic one and it's a lot more useful compared to the nintendo wifi usb adapter you can use a nintendo wifi adapter for just the wii and ds you can use a wifi router for wii ds laptops pda's ps xbox cell phones that support wifi printer sharing desktops with wireless cards and any other device that supports wifi i'd look for a g wireless router they're pretty common you hook it between your cable modem and your pc and it will have a setup where you can give your access point a name then you go in your wii's internet settings and configure it for your access point  Universal Serial Bus Wireless LAN Bluetooth Xbox Laptop Modem Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Nintendo Revolution Voice over IP Desktop computer PlayStation 2 Local area network Router PowerPC Personal computer ATI Technologies Secure Digital card AirPort Nintendo GameCube Windows XP USB flash drive Wireless RS-232 Digital Subscriber Line Broadband Internet access WiMAX Computer hardware Computer bus PlayStation Portable Xbox 360 Computer and video games Network address translation Cisco Systems Memory card Personal digital assistant Windows Server 2003 Nintendo DS IEEE 802.11 Pocket PC Embedded system IMac Game Boy Advance Wireless community network Internet Integrated Services Digital Network Satellite internet IPod Television Softmodem Game Boy Linux Telephone IPAQ Nintendo Entertainment System Ethernet IBM PC compatible Hewlett-Packard General Packet Radio Service Handheld game console Mobile phone Microsoft AppleTalk Telegraphy Timeline of computing 1990-forward Digital video recorder Denial-of-service attack Apple Computer Serial port Super Nintendo Entertainment System ZigBee Novell NetWare Sharp Zaurus MSN TV Wireless network Atari 8-bit family Computer MAC address Power line communication Sega Dreamcast Windows 2000 Tungsten Handheld Password History of Microsoft Windows IBook CompactFlash Wireless Application Protocol Mouse (computing) Floppy disk Internet service provider

ntsc wii with pal update hi i have an ntsc wii and a pal brain academy game when i put it in it says i have to update the firmware i turned of the wii and went to the options and checked for an update but it says i already have the latest firmware if i let the disk update my wii will it brick it and also how do i check to see what firmware my wii is more than likely if you had accepted the update another dialog box would have come up recognizing that you have an ntsc system and it cannot install the update i don't think nintendo would have put an option to view the actual firmware version in the console menus just because they tried to keep it very simple however none of this might matter since the game is pal the ntsc will refuse to play it in fact i'm surpised you got as far as you did and it didn't just say something along the lines of unrecognized disc the only way to play that disc on your wii would be to use a modchip or some other region coding bypass  Modchip Regional lockout DVD PlayStation Portable Super Nintendo Entertainment System PlayStation 2 Sega Saturn Nintendo Entertainment System AmigaOS NTSC Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Xbox IPod BIOS Resident Evil (video game) Atari 2600 Nintendo GameCube Laserdisc History of video games (16-bit era) PAL Atari 8-bit family Resident Evil 2 Amstrad CPC Commodore 64 System 7 (Macintosh) Patch (computing) Sega Master System Soul Calibur Sega Dreamcast Copy protection Universal Media Disc Nintendo DS Embedded system GBA Movie Player PC Engine Mozilla Firefox Homebrew (video games) High-definition television Software testing Xbox 360 S__CAM Final Fantasy Visual Basic The Sims 2 Television IBM PC compatible Windows XP Game Boy Floppy disk Blue screen of death Nintendo 64 Oscilloscope Open Firmware Steam (content delivery) Mac OS X Quake II File Allocation Table VHS Object Desktop Nintendo Apple Macintosh SAM Coup__ Pok__mon (video games) Hello world program Nintendo Seal of Quality PlayStation (original) Compact disc ATSC Computer virus GameFAQs Teletext The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Knoppix Metroid Action Replay Super Mario remake series Verizon Wireless Commodore 128 System/36 Soul Edge Microsoft Windows Windows Vista Final Fantasy VI Amiga IA-64 Gradius Chrono Trigger Debugging Telecine Resident Evil MOS Technology VIC Macintosh Finder Blu-ray Disc Def Jam Vendetta Cheat cartridge Resident Evil Code: Veronica Nintendo Power Power Macintosh G3

my nintendo wii remote problem please read ok every thing workes fine but when i got to wii sports i cant swing base ball racket hand etc what should i do i only have won wii mote one this has nothing to do with the sensor bar as that is only used for pointing at the tv make sure the batteries are not flat or going flat and are a decent brand cheap o batteries can cause problems make sure you are making a smooth swing and it is like a real baseball swing also make sure that after you have picked your mii and all that that you have the hand settings right because if you have it set for left handed and youre right handed then it wont pick up on your swing too well if all these settings are find and you are still receiving problems then it may be that you have a defective wiimote or at least one of the accelerometres are faulty in which case you will need to get it repaired or replaced most likely the second option  Baseball Mouse (computing) Tennis Softball Table tennis Baseball Stars PlayStation 2 Volleyball Anchor Oscilloscope Fast bowling Golf Babe Ruth Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Aerial (dance move) Los Angeles Clippers Bass guitar Chevrolet Corvair Reggie Jackson Nintendo Galileo spacecraft Digital photography Equine conformation Nintendo Entertainment System Outswinger Dance Dance Revolution Textile manufacturing Badminton Glossary of partner dance terms Squash (sport) IPod Canon T90 Second Battle of the Atlantic Screw R46 (New York City Subway car) Monty Hall problem STS-114 Drill bit Batting (cricket) Swingout Laptop Serve (tennis) George Costanza Knife Water polo Mario Glass Origins of baseball Gramophone record Redundant array of independent disks Plastic Chopsticks Sheepshead Baseball slang American football New York Giants Swing bowling Johnny 5 Babe Ruth's Called Shot Key (lock) IMac Toyota Prius Wario 2005-06 A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Great Britain Thermal power station PlayStation Portable Nickel-cadmium battery MII (videocassette format) Danger Hiptop Violin Bluetooth Blackjack PowerBook Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Software testing Battery (electricity) MBF-P02 Gundam Astray Red Frame Baseball bat Vin Scully Fuzion Rail tracks Manifold Watch Traffic light Boston Red Sox Ty Cobb Team Fortress Classic Strap-on dildo Floppy disk Anti-aircraft warfare Barry Bonds Bicycle lighting Rounders USS Tunny (SS-282) Hearing aid Solar cell 1957 World Series RFID National Football League Lore

two wii questions are they making a dvd wii and are they making a red and black wii the dvd wii is over a year away and the colored wii's are rumored to be coming this winter in time for the holiday i think it is doubtful to see any changes in the wii anytime soon for the simple fact that they can not keep them on shelves the way they are so why change production they are trying to increase productivity and changing these things would drop productivity for a short time while they change prcedures  DVD Family Guy Machinima Apple Computer Kevin Smith Homestar Runner Beavis and Butt-head Laserdisc Fight Club Sea level rise RuneScape economy 1919 World Series Paris Hilton My Little Pony Welfare economics Yu-Gi-Oh!

how do you syncronize a wii controler ok there are ways the easiest way is to just hope the wii automatically detects the new controller when you point it to the screen another way is to open the front flap on the wii and click the red sync button once you do that open the wii remote's battery compartment and press the red sync button also if this doesn't work grab the remote that is already syncronized and press home one you press home click on the the botttom part of the screena and click reconnect it will tell you to alternatelypress and press these buttons alternately in both controllers hope this helps  Mouse (computing) Screenshot IPod Aerial (dance move) Danger Hiptop Windows XP Floppy disk Remote control Macromedia Flash Beatmania IIDX Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Dance Dance Revolution Roomba AmigaOS Minesweeper (computer game) Canon T90 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Prank flash Pop'n Music Burglar alarm IPod nano Naval mine Team Fortress Classic Xbox 360 Sega Saturn Embedded system Game controller SCART Vision mixer Mac OS X v10.4 Ajax (programming) Taskbar Fire alarm control panel Resident Evil (video game) Konami Code Shirt Visual Basic Telegraphy Photography Visual Basic .NET Characters of Lost Nintendo GameCube Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Jumpstart 3rd Grade Palm OS Nintendo Revolution Bubble Bobble Xbox GunZ The Duel 'N Sync The Fool's Errand Toyota Prius International Phonetic Alphabet BlackBerry X Window System Manual transmission Slot machine Oscilloscope PlayStation Portable Double-click (computing) Gradius Elevator Day of Defeat Pump It Up Interactive whiteboard Greatest (Duran Duran) History of the graphical user interface Knight Rider Pop-up ad Common Unix Printing System Hello world program Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Undergarment Movie projector Geographic information system Windows Vista Treehouse of Horror IX Psychokinesis Opera (web browser) Vacuum tube Walkman ITunes Backstroke Cheating in Counter-Strike Search engine optimization Domotics Skateboarding trick Mega Man (NES) Game Boy Player Bomberman Nintendo Option key Railway signal 2000 Australian Grand Prix Guilty Gear Windows 2000 X10 (industry standard) Nintendo 64 Stopping e-mail abuse Kirby Air Ride

what wii accessories do you recommend i recommend get a wii fan stand because it will keep your wii cool so it wont over heat and it has a cool led glow also you should try buying rechargeable batteries that come with a charger instead of buying the nyko charger i bought a charger with rechargeable batteries for and i already had spare rechargeable batteries so if you dont have extra batteries you can buy a pack of rechargeable batteries and the best thing is that you can also use the batteries for a mp player or watever u want and it saves you a couple of extra bucks i didnt get the nyko charger because you can only use the battery pack for the wii controls and the rechargeable batteries i got can be used for anything  Battery electric vehicle Bicycle lighting Nickel metal hydride PlayStation Portable Ford Ranger EV Hybrid vehicle Xbox 360 Turbocharger Hybrid Synergy Drive Radio controlled car Memory effect IPod San Diego Chargers Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Nintendo DS Game Boy Dodge Charger Airsoft Lithium ion battery Electric boat Toyota Prius Armored Core Autonomous building Laptop Roomba Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Mouse (computing) Negro league baseball New York Giants Game Boy Advance SP IPod shuffle Handheld game console Ironing Halo: Combat Evolved Lithium ion polymer battery AlphaSmart American Football League Dosimeter Fuel cell Hydrogen economy Lincoln LS Vacuum tube Hot Wheels RX-79 Series Walkman Torpedo Apple Newton Buffalo Bills Lead-acid battery Game Boy Advance Sega Game Gear HP-35 Thermal power station Star Wars: Battlefront Nintendo 64 Creative Zen Solar power Cruising (maritime) Apollo Lunar Module Solar cell Green Lantern Mariner 2 Lead British Rail Class 419 Oscilloscope Internal combustion engine Roush Racing Mariner 1 Guardians of the Universe Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara General Motors EV1 First aid Submarine Cosmic Era Superweapons RX-78 mobile suit series Sega Dreamcast Air gun Miami Dolphins MSA-0011 S Gundam Pump It Up Jennifer Lopez StarCraft Secret Missions Atari ST Overclocking Tire Manual transmission G-Man (Half-Life) Game Boy Micro New England Patriots Halo 2 Handspring Energy Liger Wipeout (game) Discovery One Cincinnati Bengals Nickel Wheelchair

nyko rechargeble batteries for wii one of the remotes is fine but the other one everytime you squeeze the remote the it turns off anyone else have this problem or did i just get a broken one yeah i had this problem the problem is the connection isnt tight enough to detect that a battery is in there it is too loose i ended up taking a small piece of cardboard and duct taping it to the top part of the battery or the top of the wiimote where the battery would go and then sticking in the battery it works fine now you could return it and get a new one but since i figured it out i decided to keep it because at the time it was almost as hard to find one of those things as the wii i dont know why it is only one battery which was the same thing that happened with me  Mouse (computing) IBM PC compatible Whose Line Is It Anyway?

attention wii players parents which accessories do you use the most for which games when i buy nintendo wii for my and year old what accessories should i plan to start off with which games require what accessories do i need two of each accessory or will they take turns to play i see it has wireless capability do i need to have a wireless connection set up at home or is this just an added feature help i want them to be able to play a variety of games right off but just the basic console starts at so we'll have to build up the really cool stuff over time also any opinions on the best games for elementary middle school age groups thanks gamers hiya i'm a wii owner and i think i can help you out right now there aren't very many must have accessories but you'll want to get a extra wii remote and nunchuck as most games where they'll be playing together would require them each to have their own controller as for kid friendly games i suggest mario party and mario strikers charged these are both player games that people of all ages can enjoy you can even play with your kids all kinds of people are enjoying this console the console also comes with a pretty good game wii sports which i still play even after owning the system for months mario strikers charged does have online play but there's no way to communicate to whoever you're playing with so there's no need to worry about who your kids are meeting online as for how to get online you can set up a wifi hub in your house but if you're not using it for anything else it can be kind of expensive the other option is to buy a usb adapater that plugs into the back of your computer and shares the internet connection with the nintendo they'll sell this wherever you buy your wii online connectivity is completely optional though and you don't need it to play games but there are some neat features that use internet access such as the virtual console which allows you to download vintage video games straight to the wii and of course there's games out that allow you to connect with friends from all over the country you don't really need a memory card right off the bat as games are saved straight to the system memory cards just allow you to keep saving after you run out of space i don't know any one who has run out of space you'd have to own pretty much all the games out and half the vc games to do that anyways good luck  Computer and video games Nintendo Revolution Nintendo DS Nintendo GameCube Nintendo Nintendo Entertainment System PlayStation Portable Game Boy Advance Game Boy Xbox Super Nintendo Entertainment System Handheld game console Sega PlayStation 2 Nintendo 64 PlayStation 3 Video game music Sega Dreamcast Universal Serial Bus IPod TurboGrafx 16 Multiplayer Super Mario Bros. 3 Super Mario 64 Mouse (computing) PC Engine Windows XP Game controller Mario Neopets Wi-Fi Atari 2600 Internet Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Commodore 64 Atari 8-bit family Super Mario remake series Computer role-playing game ROM image Super Mario Bros.

where can i buy the wii zapper i bought resident evil today and the guy working said they had released the zapper shell and it was selling online for about but i cant find it anywhere the wii zapper itself is not for sale yet however if you look on amazon com they are selling things that are very very similar to the wii zapper they're pretty much identical operate in the same manner but they don't have the wii logo on it nor the warantee from the manufacturers i would suggest looking on amazon first if they don't have it there you can always check ebay they sell different varieties including rifles pistols and a machine gun type set up make sure you get the one that holds both the remote and nunchuck and not just the remote the one that holds both is the one that is most similar to the real wii zapper  Superior Defender Gundam Force Amazon.com Airsoft Nintendo Machine gun Cartridge (firearms) NES Zapper Federal assault weapons ban Light gun Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando Trademark M60 machine gun Team Fortress Classic Business-to-consumer electronic commerce Handloading Internet fraud Super Nintendo Entertainment System Electronic commerce Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Bulk vending Marathon (computer game) Embedded system Submachine gun Sega Dreamcast .22 Long Rifle Krag-J__rgensen Starsiege: Tribes Nine Inch Nails Resident Evil 4 GoldenEye The Star Wars Holiday Special PlayStation 2 MAME Counter-Strike Bullet Auction GLOCK Modem Google ROM image Assault rifle Gun politics IBM PC compatible Shotgun Nintendo GameCube Nintendo Entertainment System Mutual fund Firearm Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Windows XP Commodore International Mozilla Firefox Star Trek Customizable Card Game Cigarette Colt's Manufacturing Company Apple Macintosh Sun Microsystems Amiga Turok: Dinosaur Hunter Unreal Trigun characters Internal ballistics Carbine Battlefield 2 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Electric guitar Beretta 92F/FS RX-78 mobile suit series TimeSplitters: Future Perfect Monopoly (game) Perry Rhodan Sonic the Hedgehog Compact audio cassette Armia Krajowa Heckler & Koch G3 Rifle .357 SIG SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Dot-com Windows 3.x M82 (rifle) Grand Theft Auto III Birmingham Small Arms Company Enigma machine Punisher Personal weapon Family Guy Windows 2000 BMW Live 8 M16 (rifle) Discus (fish) Timeline of computing 1990-forward Common Lisp GunZ The Duel Battlefield Vietnam Tribes Aerial Assault Beltway sniper attacks Kammerlader

how can i beat the mercenaries fast to unlock the hand cannon for re wii edition plz answer to beat quickly need to unlock gun fast ah going down memory lane again just last week i was just like you and slowly but surely i managed to beat that part of the game here's what i learned each character has the ability to make a high kill chain but how you use their weapons is the hard part so here's a couple of tips you can use rule head shots are the best shots to take down everybody in sight krauser and wesker are good when it comes down to mass amount of enemies both of them have a least one flash grenade if you come across a mass amount of ganados toss one at the ground and then get as close as you can while they are blinded and then use their special attack krauser uses his arm and they all go splat wesker uses the thrust punch and bowls them all to the ground rule you use your strongest attack against the toughest enemies and make a stand village bella sisters military water base doctor salvador castle clawed ganados can't remember the real name military land base j j these are the strongest enemies in the game under the bosses to take them down give yourself some distance and shoot them at the knees then aim for the head for the clawed ganados use flame and hand grenades to make him take a knee then blast him with your strongest weapon rule don't worry about the amount of enemies it may seem like breaking the first rule but the point of this part of the game is to kill and surrive and give yourself enough time to move once you hit the mark do what you can to time out the clock if you can use these three rules you can get that hand cannon but there is a stronger weapon than that it's called the plagas removal laser a weapon of mass destruction that fires intense radiation that can and will kill birds objects and anything or anyone that is infected with las plagas like the note says if you remove it it's adult state it will bring the host along with it there's only one rule when using that weapon give yourself enough time for it to charge and let it rip it can even kill saddler with one blow i mean it will kill him and it will skip that part where you get the rocket launcher to truely kill him good luck buddy  Doom enemies Turok: Rage Wars Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Combine (Half-Life 2) Blood (computer game) Turok 2: Seeds of Evil Tenshinhan Ada Wong Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening Jack Krauser Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Naruto jutsu Armored Core Volleyball Worms weapons and tools Unreal Las Plagas Quake III Arena Star Wars: Battlefront Tank Resident Evil (video game) Bubble Bobble Rocket propelled grenade Star Wars: Battlefront II Natural Selection (computer game) Internal ballistics Weapon Albert Wesker Battlefield 2 GunBound Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal GunZ The Duel Leon S.

trauma center wii i am thinking about getting trauma center for the wii and i heard that it doesnt have support i have a widesceen tv will i have black bars on either side when i play or will it fill the screen also i had trauma center on the ds got as far as the bomb level is it worth buying the wii version the ratio shouldn't affect the gameplay too much in reality if it's not supported but you could check nintendo com forums for some answers from people who actually work for nintendo i have played it a couple of times it is a ton of fun and decently challenging i never played the ds version so i can't really compare them for you your best course of action may be to rent the game first and see if you like it enough to shell out the cash  Dance Dance Revolution Nintendo DS $ale of the Century Gradius Galaga Nintendo Revolution Super Nintendo Entertainment System Beatmania IIDX Wheel of Fortune Nintendo GameCube Super Mario Bros.

does anyone know how long can a wii detect an internet router because i have a psp and and can detect a signal ft away but i think the wii has a better range right the detection range is not the only thing to consider the closer to the router the stronger and cleaner the signal also the range is not determined by the device but by the router itself and any interfering walls or objects in between one other thing your wii may have a better usable range than your psp because it has a better transmitter good luck  Wi-Fi Radar Router IEEE 802.11 Federal Standard 1037C Antenna (radio) Sonar Radio Communications protocol Nintendo DS SETI PlayStation 3 Digital Subscriber Line History of radar Phase-locked loop Telephone Ethernet Magnetic resonance imaging Global Positioning System TV-FM DX Denial-of-service attack Sensor Cellular network Ionosphere Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects PlayStation Portable Wireless access point Multiprotocol Label Switching Microphone Non-directional beacon Passive radar Wireless LAN Code division multiple access Transmitter RFID Network address translation Vacuum Cisco Systems Galileo spacecraft Network congestion avoidance Universal Serial Bus Color Stereoscopy Paintball Routing Optical fiber Seismometer IPv6 LORAN Detection theory Dowsing Stealth aircraft Signal-to-noise ratio IPv4 Magnet Covert listening device Power line communication Repeater Amateur radio Computer networking device Radio direction finding Speed of light Piezoelectricity Traffic light Compact disc Phase-shift keying Telephone tapping Electronic amplifier Cassini-Huygens Roomba X-ray X10 (industry standard) Software-defined radio HyperTransport Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Hardware random number generator Infrared Longwave Citizens' band radio Technology in the Stargate universe Digital audio broadcasting ATLAS experiment History of radio Embedded system Internet security Phreaking MAC address Nuclear magnetic resonance LIDAR Asynchronous Transfer Mode Broadband Internet access Deep Space 1 IS-IS Lightning Fermi paradox Distributed computing Session Initiation Protocol Automatic gain control

legend of zelda twilight princess i am thinking of this being my next wii game do you think it is worth buying does it take advantage of the great things the wii remote can do it's something worth buying it was a really good game you swing the wii remote to use your sword and you use the nunchuk as a shield it does take advantage of the things the wii remote is capable of doing when you do buy it though stock up on some aa batteries it takes on average or more hours of game play to beat the game it really eats up the battery life all in all i thought it was an excellent game but don't save in the big cannon room if you get to that part then you will know what i'm talking about if you haven't already read about it though they probably already fixed the bug in the games now but you can never be too careful  Princess Zelda The Legend of Zelda series Link (Legend of Zelda) The Legend of Zelda series characters The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker The Legend of Zelda series races Zora The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker characters Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Master Sword Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters Zelda II: The Adventure of Link Nintendo Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Legend of Zelda series songs Moblin Poker jargon The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Super Mario 64 Koji Kondo RuneScape quests Ganon Agahnim Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Starsiege: Tribes The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time places Game Boy Advance Yoshi The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe RuneScape weapons Super Smash Bros.

is the wii's internet browser better than the ps 's i'm not too big a fan of the ps browser it's too frustrating trying to input letters what about you ughh honestly the wii is really frustrating to input letters too it's super slow because the keyboard is spread out through the entire screen and the sensor isn't quite as keen as it should be so it takes a while to get everything in there other than that the picture is great and the speed is good at my house but i guess that would depend on your isp also i really like the fact that the favorites are conveniently located at the bottom of the screen and are easy to get to if you have certain sites you always go to it's perfect hope this helps  Mouse (computing) Password Cangjie method Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Danger Hiptop Sega Dreamcast World Wide Web Computer Brainfuck Tribes 2 Keyboard layout Dance Dance Revolution Unicode Internet Explorer Cross site scripting International Phonetic Alphabet PlayStation Portable GunBound GIF X Window System Computer and video game genres Digital photography Beatmania IIDX Cascading Style Sheets Theory of conduct Game programmer Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Spyware Prank flash Copy protection Internet privacy Manual transmission Opera (web browser) Arabic alphabet Screenshot Pump It Up Sega Saturn Bubble Bobble DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Macromedia Flash Star Destroyer In The Groove (game) AutoComplete Super Nintendo Entertainment System HTML editor Starsiege: Tribes Favicon Internet service provider Law of value Spam (electronic) Unicode and HTML Screenplay Prolog User interface Logo programming language Fast bowling Machinima Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Color CPU cache Computer accessibility Blue screen of death DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Broadband Internet access Electronic amplifier The Internet Movie Database Uniform Resource Locator Commodore BASIC Drifting (motorsport) Forth programming language Game show DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Internet troll Halting problem Computer keyboard Internet Netscape Communications Corporation Nintendo DS Netscape Navigator Final Fantasy Function (mathematics) Browser wars Emacs Windows XP Stereoscopy Speech recognition Bulgarian language XForms Hangul Chicago White Sox Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis RuneScape cheats Dave Matthews Band MySpace Konami Code Dvorak Simplified Keyboard E-mail Columbia Pictures Jumpstart 3rd Grade

i have been told that you can download old nintendo games for use with the wii is this true one of my friend's children is getting a nintendo wii for theire birthday i was told that we could download old games from the n snes etc for free but i do not know where from please help i've got a wii and i'll tell you this it's called the virtual console and you can download games to your wii but you can't download every single one and you have to use wii points which come from cards that cost you money for some games you can use your wii remote to play or a gamecube controller it can plug into the wii but for some you need the classic controller the only thing that's good about having the virtual console is the pure fact that you can have a different control setup some games like the legend of zelda cost a whole card which can be to bucks i forget which it is it's best to just buy the old systems and games and play them on what they originally played on for instance super mario rpg would be played on the super nintendo you can get most of these systems for a very low price but do not get the gamecube as the wii is backwards compatable with it  Nintendo Nintendo Revolution Nintendo 64 Nintendo GameCube Super Nintendo Entertainment System Game Boy Advance Nintendo Entertainment System Computer and video games Game Boy Nintendo DS Computer role-playing game Console wars History of computer and video games The Legend of Zelda series Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars Sega Nintendo Power Xbox Super Mario 64 Link (Legend of Zelda) TurboGrafx 16 The Legend of Zelda Koji Kondo The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time E-Reader PlayStation 2 Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles Yoshi PlayStation 3 History of video games (16-bit era) Nintendo iQue Game controller Super Mario Bros. 3 Super Mario remake series Super Smash Bros.

is sonic the hedghog going to be on super smash bros brawl i keep hearing different stories and i am wanting to find out for certain if sonic was on there then i would definetly be buying the game if not i am still not sure what to expect for the nintendo wii sonic has not been confirmed to be in super smash bros brawl but neither have most shoo in characters as of now it is extremely extremely likely that he will be in the game probably about a chance if i had to put a percentage on it many sites such as ign will agree with me if you need to look it up the owners of sonic have gotten very friendly with nintendo and were very intent on having sonic in the game another reason that further confirms that sonic will be playable in brawl is the upcoming wii game sonic and mario olympics not positive on the title its close to that at least this game will feature mario and sonic together in one game this makes it a very reasonable assumption that if mario and sonic are main characters together in one game that sonic would also be featured in brawl as well to help promote the olympics game sonic was also the fan requested character for ssbb and nintendo has stated that they will strongly base character inclusions on what the fans want the most to sum it up the game should be one of the best of its time with or without sonic with that said sonic is extremely likely to be included in brawl and i highly recommend purchasing this game check http smashbros com for updates every weekday if sonic is confirmed this will probably be the first place you will hear about it  Nintendo Revolution Super Mario 64 Super Mario 128 Mario Super Smash Bros.

is the mod chip installer for the wii trustworthy the guy has the website adress www phuongmods com please answer im dying to know if he is putting a mod chip inside any console is a risk if it requires soldering work the installer could damage the motherboard or other critical components with the soldering gun heat the question is whether or not this particular installer is trustworthy i have personally never used his services what i recommend is contacting the installer and asking him for references for some of his install work of course he's only going to give you references of people who got working consoles back then contact the references and ask how their experience went there is always a possibility even with good references that he could fry your wii and it could end up dead adding a mod chip to any console automatically voids the warranty so you should also keep that in mind good luck  Modchip Xbox Windows 2000 Modding Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Printed circuit board Case modding Solder Overclocking Team Fortress Classic Super Nintendo Entertainment System Drill bit Computer and video games PlayStation 2 PHP Epoxy Universal Serial Bus Halo 2 Doom 3 IBM PC compatible PlayStation 3 Solar cell Commodore 64 AmigaOS Heat sink Mozilla Firefox Unreal Halo: Combat Evolved Starsiege: Tribes Quake II Half-Life 2 Thermal power station Airbag TRS-80 Color Computer MOS Technology 6502 Counter-Strike M16 (rifle) Cheating in Counter-Strike Surface-mount technology Copy protection Xbox 360 SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Video game music Dynamic random access memory Fallout (computer game) Radeon Nuclear power Hubble Space Telescope Quake III Arena ATI Technologies Poker jargon Microprocessor Hard disk Galactic Civilizations Condom Mozilla Application Suite Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Philip J.

when do you think majora's mask will be released on the wii's virtual console i'm short on cash here and someone is offering for my legend of zelda collector's edition on the gamecube the only reason i'm holding onto it is because of majora's mask every other game on the disk i can buy to play on the wii and it allows me to play it on different controls compared to just the gamecube controller on the collector's edition what should i do here should i hold onto the collector's edition for it will go up in value over time or should i just sell it away since majora's mask is pretty much guaranteed on the virtual console actually not if majora's mask was on the virtual console it would be for being an n title so it's legend of zelda legend of zelda ii adventures of link ocarina of time majora's mask to buy all the games on the disk despite it saying collector's edition i don't see it going for much in the future if the games in the compilation are readily available on the wii and collector's editions of many games don't go for much more than their standard editions there is a reason it's called the collector's edition that means over time it will be worth more in like years it could be worth a lot of money i e more than bucks and plus it would cost more to buy all of the collector's edition's games for virtual console than the measly bucks  The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask The Legend of Zelda series Nintendo 64 The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Nintendo GameCube Legend of Zelda series songs The Legend of Zelda series characters The Legend of Zelda Koji Kondo Nintendo Nintendo Power The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters Rupee (Legend of Zelda) Octorok The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Master Quest The Legend of Zelda series enemies Princess Zelda Ganon The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask characters Link (Legend of Zelda) Interactive Achievement Awards Zelda II: The Adventure of Link Computer and video games that have been considered the greatest ever Nintendo Entertainment System The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Sega Rare (video game company) The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Sega Dreamcast Nintendo Revolution The Legend of Zelda series races Xbox Master Sword Zora Super Smash Bros.

is there going to be any motion sensing in super smash bros brawl or do you just sit there on you big fat butt pressing buttons seeing as there is going to be four different controller configurations gamecube controller classic controller nunchuk and wii remote and sideways wii remote i imagine they will include some motion sensing to add variety to the gameplay especially considering that there's an extremely limited amount of buttons on just the sideways wiimote they'd almost have to include some motion controls to be able to do everything you can normally do in smash  Super Smash Bros.

nintendo wii owners i have a question what are some fun and realistic sports games on the wii i liked the wii sports thing but i thought golf was unrealistic and was hoping for more control over the tennis player i loved bowling does anyone else recommend a game that is very realistic or are they non existent tiger woods is much more realistic golf both in physics and swing style although putting leaves something to be desired imo madden is realistic in that it's really complicated with plays and full season modes and improving your players by doing drills the actual throwing the ball and running the ball motions are different of course because most gamers would get pretty tired running yards as their nfl player does madden is just coming out or just came out so you may be able to find madden ' at cheaper prices to try there's a new brunswick i think bowling game that's coming out that seems rather realistic there's only one baseball game out the bigs and it's sort of realistic it's more of an arcade game though and the actual hitting technique is more up and down rather than side to side so not totally representative in wii sports there's actually more tennis control than you think spin and how high the ball is hit depends upon whether you put spin on the wii mote they just don't tell you that good enough list  Baseball Stars National Football League Baseball Tennis Computer and video game genres Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XXXVI Cincinnati Bengals Fast bowling Cricket Sports timeline Volleyball Super Bowl XXVI American football Super Bowl XVIII Softball EA Sports Stormfront Studios Tiger Woods Glossary of American football Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl XI Super Bowl XXIV Mario National Football League Lore First-person shooter San Francisco 49ers Cleveland Browns Counter-Strike Donovan McNabb FIFA Series Michael Vick Nintendo DS Super Bowl XXXIII Sport Pinball New England Patriots St. Louis Rams Tag Bo Jackson Ty Cobb Nintendo Detroit Tigers Electronic Arts Super Bowl XXIII Billiards Andre Agassi Babe Ruth Pittsburgh Steelers Major League Baseball Satchel Paige Basketball Tris Speaker Super Bowl IX St. Louis Cardinals Cricket ball Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XXV Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XXIX Super Bowl VI Paintball Super Bowl XVI Craps World Series Beer Pong Baseball statistics Types of bowlers in cricket Pete Sampras Tennis Croquet Sudden death Beatmania IIDX Super Bowl Rounders Reggie Jackson Monday Night Football Super Bowl XXXIV Field hockey Comparison of Canadian and American football Super Bowl XII Baseball scorekeeping Ultimate (sport) Snooker Four square Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl XIX Tecmo Super Bowl American Football League

if we hold the wii remote horizontally would it affect the sensor i was wondering if the sensor would be affected since if we are holding the remote horizontally our hand would block the sensor completely the sensorbar and sensor in the front of the wiimote is only used for pointing at the screen so teh wiimote knows its location in relation to the screen the actual information is sent via bluetooth so it isnt affected no matter how you hold the wiimote  Mouse (computing) Touchscreen Geographic information system IMac Armored Core Digital photography Nintendo Revolution Burglar alarm X10 (industry standard) Digital camera Pixel Touchpad STS-114 Anemometer Traffic light Dance Dance Revolution Railway signal Backstroke Galactic Civilizations Danger Hiptop Graphics tablet Bass guitar BlackBerry Radar Glossary of American football Yohoho!

will the wii classic controller work with gamecube games when i go to the disc channel after i insert a gamecube game and press start the controller turns off while it is loading then it won't connect until i turn it back on what am i doing wrong no when you put a gamecube game in the wii it transforms the wii's hardware to a gamecubes specifications this includes reducing its cpu and video card speeds to that of a gamecube this also means that it is no longer a wii and does not have the knowledge or ability to recognise wiimotes so you have to use a gamecube controller and gamecube memory cards the classic controller is only for use in some games like super smash brothers brawl when it is released dragonball z budokai tenkaichi and a few others they can also be used on all virtual console games  Nintendo GameCube Nintendo Revolution PlayStation 2 Nintendo Super Nintendo Entertainment System Xbox Nintendo 64 Sega Dreamcast Console wars PlayStation 3 PlayStation Portable Game Boy Advance Game Boy Modchip Sony Computer Entertainment Resident Evil (video game) Animal Crossing ATI Technologies Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Nintendo DS Video game music TurboGrafx 16 Action Replay Game controller Super Mario 128 PC Engine History of video games (Sixth generation era) Handheld game console PowerPC Sega Saturn Dragon Ball Z Video game console Commodore 64 Sega Console game Pok__mon Amiga Atari 2600 Windows 2000 Xbox 360 Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Super Smash Bros.
