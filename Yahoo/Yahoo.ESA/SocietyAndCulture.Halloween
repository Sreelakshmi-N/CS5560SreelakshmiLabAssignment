do you have any ideas for a college haunted house on a limited budget i am doing a small halloween thingy for my college housing complex i need ideas for something to do that is cheap cheap cheap any ideas are great thanks make sure that any windows which face the front of the housing complex have been blacked out from inside black plastic garbage bags work fine you may have to split them or double them up but they're cheap enough black plastic shower curtains can often be found in the dollar stores grab a lot if you can find them because we'll be using them later replace your porch and outside lights with blue red or orange bulbs a black light works great on the porch if you have some glow in the dark critters or effects you can place nearby if your street is well lit then the black light effect is reduced so save your money in that case portable spot or flood lights with colored bulbs can be aimed at your roof or door to add additional lighting effects if you have some tiki torches left over from the summer then place them strategically up and down the front walk wal mart and the better dollar stores have halloween lights that are a lot like christmas lights but have little pumpkins or cats on each bulb they're cheap and you can string them around railings and lay them in bushes of course you'll need some black cats jack o lanterns and fake spider webs hanging from the porch decorate your front door to look like a coffin it s a great effect you can also buy the styrofoam grave stones to put on your lawn or you can make them yourself out of spare lumber and some black or grey paint don't forget the scary music wolf howls plus some moans and groans when your gory guests first set foot inside your haunted house set the tone for the remainder of their visit by having a body hanging from the inside light fixture or some other convenient point of death stuff a pair of jeans and an old shirt like you're making a scarecrow you can use an empty bleach container for the face and cut out or paint on the features top it off with an old hat or as an alternative hang a huge papier m ch bat instead of the dead guy don't forget plenty of plastic spiders and webs if there are rooms or staircases leading from the entryway which are not part of the tour cover them with those extra shower curtains that i told you to get or use more garbage bags close off doors to rooms where you don't want visitors to go decorate the doors to look like coffins or hang ghoulish effects over them you can also block them off using black plastic or shower curtains most visitors won't even know that the doors are there doors to off limit rooks are also great places to station your human ghoul helpers who will be jumping out and scaring the dickens out of your guests just make sure that they know to never actually touch anyone that can open you up to a lot of legal problems and it might get them into a fist fight with a visitor with no sense of humor create you inside effects by using dark and colored lighting in each room black light sensitive decorations work great inside but only if you have black light bulbs installed sprinkle gruesome props throughout your rooms you can make great bloody hands by filling surgical gloves up with sand tying the open end off with a rubber band and then some blood effects with red paint dry ice creates great fog effects but it will burn the skin if touched so don't leave it where guests can get at it hang creepy things from the ceilings wet not dripping wet yarn feels really creepy when it brushes across someone s face as they are entering a dark room spirtz it throughout the night to keep it wet remember that most fishing line will react to black lights so use black thread instead walk through each room as if you were a visitor fill in empty areas with appropriate props re walk the house several times until you are happy remember that you have a lot of flammable things in your haunted house candles smoking and lighted flames of any type are off limits keep several a fire extinguishers handy and spread them around the house make sure that your helpers know how to use them also make sure that each helper has a flashlight and knows where the room s light switches are in case anyone gets hurt or a young child becomes too frightened to continue the tour that s it you're on your way to having the dream haunted house that you've always wanted better get busy it will be halloween before you know it  Professional wrestling match types The Haunted Mansion The Time Machine Fire fighting

whose ready for halloween i sure the heck am i know it's weird and all but i prepare for the holiday year round oh yeah i'm like you i take stock of what went well and what could be improved and then i start planning for halloween on november i am proud to say that i live in the best dressed house on the block every halloween i try to balance the effects between truly macabre displays and lighthearted elements as i don't want to frighten away all the wee ones trick or treating as my display has grown each year i've begun setting up earlier and earlier in the season once more this year i plan to start placing fall figures near the house on the autumn solstice which includes placing three scarecrows about a dozen pumpkins several artificial crows cornstalks and hay bales in front of the house i will begin building my actual halloween display on october it usually takes me a couple of full hour days to set up the essentials but i'm adding elements to my display until october here are some of things that people can expect from me this year i'm going to place three or four large inflatables around the front yard again to draw the attention of passing motorists as i live adjacent to a busy thoroughfare the homer i use as my avatar is one of the figures i've also got a vampire bart sitting atop a stack of jack o' lanterns and a huge jack o' lantern with a witches hat i'm still undecided now whether i will use my inflatable spider this year the biggest transformation will be turning the front yard into a cemetery again using several expensive and very realistic looking tombstones that i've acquired over the years i try to add at least one new tombstone each halloween i've got two great life size figures that i always place near the front door one is a very realistic mummy and the other is a gjenganger i've always created horror tables for the people coming up to the front door and this year will be no exception i usually decorate one of them with hundreds and i mean hundreds of realistic spiders and insects crawling everywhere including some gigantic ones i also place boiling cauldrons disintegrating hearts and brains percolating blood fountains maggots an alien autopsy and life size reptiles on or about the table this year i will have at least three horror tables i'm planning on setting up my glow in the dark tent again this year so that my guests will have to pass through it to reach the front door i'll lay out my ouija board for people to play perhaps somebody will accept the challenge this time so far no one has i will build an even bigger jack o' lantern wall this halloween it grows larger each year last year i displayed over jack o' lanterns this year i plan to add at least more i will add to the three skeletons and two ghouls that i hang from the trees i want to modify the two ghosts i've set up to roam the yard i will certainly place more crows and ravens on the haystacks and tombstones i've already bought more torches and lanterns to help guide my guests to the front entrance of the house i always decorate the large spruce tree with halloween lights it's my halloween tree but this year i'm going with leds instead i have already placed eerie faces on the other deciduous trees in the yard and i'm going to add two more this year they great thing about the tree faces is that i can leave them up year round i'm going to march out more than one bloody foot trail for people to follow this year in years past i've tracked out but one set of blood footprints from the house to the front door i'll lay out paper jack o' lantern luminaries along the sidewalk again i'm also going to place more skulls on posts this year i had about a dozen last year and i'd like to triple the number this halloween i haven't decided whether i'll encircle the yard again with crime tape there's so much more i'm planning but i don't have room to tell you here finally i will give out gobs of candy and trinkets including skull and body parts key chains and skeleton key rings i have spent literally thousands of dollars on my ever growing halloween display over the years and i expect to spend thousands on it again this year trick or treat happy

what costum to waret his year that i can be with last years dress last year i was a witch and i still have the outfit my mom hates halloween but i love it and she dose not whant me to buy a costume that cost alot so i thought why not where last years costume dress but be something else but i don't kno what to be anyone got an idea i'm not sure of what the dress looks like but here are some ideas maybe a vampire already suggested but still a good choice get some cheap fangs and fake blood and dab it around your mouth morticia addams if you have dark hair curl it a bit at the ends or straighten it like amd or get a wig if you dont have dark hair use lots of black eye make up and red lipstick you can make yourself pale using baby powder or any powder lily munster again if you have dark hair you can use powder to make a grey strip in your hair then pretty much do what you'd do with morticia a evil fairy find you some wings and do your make up really crazy and glittery but also keep it evil lookings use dark colors a goth prom queen again use dark make up get a cheapy kid tiara from somewheres and make a sash out of old fabric you have or buy one from somewhere i know places like claires or icing have sashes with sayings on them usually happy birthday but you could turn them around get black roses or white roses and paint them black or instead of painting them black dip the tips of them in tea or coffee and make them look old you dont need tons of money for halloween i never spend much money on halloween costumes i go to goodwill and find something cheap there and usually use stuff that i already have around the house food coloring gelatin tissue and many other things you'd be surprised at what you could do with things at home if you think of anything you'd want to be message me or something and i can see if i can help you out any better odds are you probably already have what you need at home good luck and happy haunting gah that was soo corny of me to say lol  The Addams Family Black Phoebe Buffay's songs Barbie Wig (hair) Death rock fashion Gothic rock The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Vampire Invader Zim The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe W.I.T.C.H.

halloween party ideas i am thinking about throwing a halloween party and i have to have the best party ever i threw one a few months ago and evryone was talking about it i went all out and i need to top it with my next party i will most likely go all out with decorations but what can i do to make it spectacular make your whole house like a haunted house i know it sounds lame and over done but make it your own you should get a bunch of decorations like you said and if you have the money hire people to be ghosts and dead people walking around the place or again with money have people sitting around the house during the party that look dead and spring up once in a while or having someone kill someone fake that'll scare everyone make sure to have really good halloween food and lots of candy scare tricker treaters too that's always fun don't forget the alcohol if you are of age  Halloween Dead Like Me Trick-or-treat Treehouse of Horror XII Treehouse of Horror XI Sluggy Freelance Day of the Dead EastEnders The Amber Spyglass Ron and Fez Scream (film) Garfield Carnival Prank flash The Haunted Mansion Rice University Egg (food) Time Out of Mind Knott's Berry Farm Piccolo Junior Saga Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Horror film New York's Village Halloween Parade Treehouse of Horror IX Rent (musical) The Emancipation of Mimi Avenue Q Casper the Friendly Ghost Silent Night, Deadly Night The Apprentice 2 RuneScape economy Animal Crossing The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Blonde on Blonde Ghost Columbine High School massacre Mad Money The Shining (film) Eric Cartman Culture of France Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Misfits Knots Landing Great Teacher Onizuka Satchel Paige Social rule National Lampoon's Animal House Shaggy dog story Survivor (novel) Breath of Fire III Nineteen Eighty-Four Treehouse of Horror XIII Mardi Gras Tag Beavis and Butt-head The Inside Phish Aquemini The 7th Guest The X-Files (season 1) The Young Ones (TV series) Make money fast Batman: The Long Halloween Le Malade imaginaire Pitaten Charles Dickens Milton H.
