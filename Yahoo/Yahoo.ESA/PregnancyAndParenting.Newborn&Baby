hyland's teething tablets dropped in bottle as i've posted before i feel a tooth so i've been using hylands tablets orajel and cool teething rings some suggested to drop a few hyland's tablest in baby's last bottle before bed anyone else tried this was it effective so i'm guessing the tablets work inside out like a pain killer new mom very paranoid i never tried that as i breastfed and didn't use bottles but they worked alright by putting them under my sons tongue or anywhere in his mouth really they don't really help with the pain as much as they help to take the edge off of all of the symptoms associated with teething  Breastfeeding Cocaine Knots Landing Liam Gallagher Milton H.

is it normal to get a bill for your hospital stay as well as the babies i got seperate bills also did anyone get a bill for the hearing test i would have thought that would have been included in the other bill once your baby is born the hospital sets up an account for that child they are a new patient so all injections supplies and tests are now billed under that new patient they are seperate bills because they are different patients in regards to the hearing test bill it all depends on your insurance coverage as to what they will and will not cover  Health insurance Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Medicare (Canada) Traumatic brain injury In vitro fertilisation Stomach cancer Hypoglycemia Urinary incontinence Infertility Medical malpractice Terri Schiavo Mental Health Act 1983 Medicine Publicly funded medicine Prostate cancer Stroke Emergency Medical Services Insurance Medical record Prenatal diagnosis Aortic dissection Health care in the United States Allergy Medicare (Australia) Hannibal Lecter Cytomegalovirus Pharmaceutical company Canada Health Act Medicare (United States) Childbirth Dialysis Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Myocardial infarction Midwifery Pneumonia Psychiatry US health reform under FDR Hepatitis C Intravenous therapy Growth hormone treatment Hospital for Sick Children Sleep apnea Erectile dysfunction Health maintenance organization Diabetes mellitus Days of our Lives Canadian and American health care systems compared Coeliac disease Government involvement in the Terri Schiavo case Nuclear medicine Androgen insensitivity syndrome Mesothelioma Physician Prolactinoma National Health Service Social Security (United States) Acromegaly Radiosurgery Malignant melanoma Insulin Cancer 1925 serum run to Nome Clinical depression HIV test Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Multiple sclerosis John F.

when should i ween my month old off her pacifier i want to get rid of it before she starts crawling and walking ive seen too many year olds walking around sucking away and i dont like that idea i want it to be as painless as possible for my daughter and me she doesnt use it unless we are putting her to sleep and i am not a fan of the 'cry it out' method any tips you seem to be aware of breaking the habit so i don't think you will let it go too far there are people who do not give their children a pacifier at all and others who let it go past two years which is a problem months old may be too young to take her off of it you are not overusing it in fact you are already using it sparingly so my thought would be to continue to use it at bedtime and as you have until you really feel it's time to let it go probably between months or as you discern but the common thought is it should be done before potty training she will put up a fuss but that is to be expected just tell her she is a big girl and doesn't need it she'll fuss anyway but a toy or other positive reinforcement is ok like in potty training maybe a stuffed toy at bedtime would help if she misses the pacifier remember they have a sucking reflex that must develop as part of their growth and it is important that they do that but not too far past what would be the normal weaning stage or it can become a different problem i would google pacifiers or something similar and see what experts say  Breastfeeding Cat Fecal incontinence Atomic Kitten Stuttering Infantilism Housebreaking Autism Childbirth The Shining (film) Ferret Kodocha Procrastination Elimination communication Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fertility awareness Hypnosis Social rule EastEnders Sleep Shaggy dog story Maggie Simpson Strap-on dildo Milton H.

its my baby i got pregnant accidently when i was and because we used a condom i didnt realise untill the th month of my prgenancy and by then it was too late to anything about it i didn't no what to do i knew that i didnt want it and i was planing on giving it up for adoption but during the last month of my pregnancy i fell in love with the baby i felt it move and hiccup it was amazing so when the time came months ago and i gave birth to a little boy called mali i couldnt bare to part from him the promlem is that i live with my mum dad and sister but my mum wont let me do anything with my baby she insists on feeding him changing him playing with him she wont even let me hold him for to long or breast feed him i am perfectly capable of looking after him i no i need family help and i appreciate that but i want to be able to hold my baby i have tryed talking to my mum but she just calls me stupid saying that i cant look after him i just want my baby to myself i know what some of you think im too young and yes i know that but i love my boyfirend and he has stuck by me it's not like one day we just decided to have sex we planed it for ages we when to clinics to get checked over we love each other i know im lucky to have a mum who cares but she wont let me hold him or olay with him or bath him even my dad has realised and trys to get my mum out of the house so i can have just one day with my baby my boyfirend comes round everyday to see mali and my mum is rude to him and acts like he is not part of his life ut he is i know im too young but whats done is done and i will get through it i just want my baby to know who i am i love him i was even thinking about moving in with my boyfirend his parents are lovely and they understand me i wish my parents were more like his they understand and wouldnt treat me like i dont exists you dont understand im now and i am grreatful i get help form my dad and sister and my boyfreinds parents and i am so greatful i love having them around cos i no i cant do it on my own but my mum wont let my hold my own baby my mum wont let me put him to bed they only thing i get to do is look at him when he is sleeping and prepear his dinner he sleeps in my mums room even though i first of all made room in my room i buy loads of outfits and tos for him but my mum hardly outs him in any of them he is going to start thing she is his mum i just want my baby and i love the extra help but my mums just gone to far i suggest moving out as soon as possible if she is that controlling and tells you constantly that you are stupid then what will she be telling your baby verbal abuse is just as dangerous as physical just make sure you stay with his parents or another family member you are still only and that is not a child but a young adult even young adults need help from older adults if you have no other alternative than to stay stay for three years and enjoy the free childcare then when you are get out and take your little one with you no child needs to be told he or she is stupid when your mom can act like an adult and be civil then accept her apologies for acting like a tyrant everything will work itself out you sound like a sweet girl and i have all faith that you will raise a wonderful little boy it may be hard to be a young single mom but many of mothers have done it and nothing is impossible and p s just because the government and society tell us that your have to be to be considered an adult doesn't mean that it is always true with everyone i know many young adults who act and are more mature than their older counterparts good luck  EastEnders Friends Little Britain Abortion debate Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten Shaggy dog story Infantilism Recurring South Park characters Laura Schlessinger One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Knots Landing Married... with Children Rocko's Modern Life Teenage pregnancy Milton H.

how will you know if your baby is hot or cold i know you swaddle them and wrap them but do babies every get too cold or too warm how do you know im not going to know when to put what on my baby the best thing you can do is to dress the baby as you would dress yourself to be comfortably warm or cool if you are a little bit cool then you may want to put a onsie under your child's clothes in the winter months i always kept my children in a onsie under all clothing even when they slept since they often kick covers off if you hot and wearing sandals then let your child go barefoot too if the toes are warm when you take your child out though put them in some booties or socks because you will enter places that are cooler than others use your mother instincts because they will drive you in the right direction on how to take care of your little one we are all nervous in the beginning but we get the hang of it pretty quick it's amazing how we as moms can learn the different cries of our babies i'm wet i'm hungry i'm bored or i'm tired  Comanche Sauna Shoe Japanese tea ceremony Breastfeeding Characters in the Smurfs Customs and etiquette of Japan Air conditioning Marilyn Monroe Diving suit Hyperthermia First aid Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Infant Tire Social aspects of clothing Jackass: The Movie Skateboarding trick Teen Girl Squad Clothing EastEnders Basic English Climate of the United Kingdom Johnny Appleseed Kimono Diaper Hypothermia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Paul Is Dead Undergarment Gwen Stefani Humphrey Bogart Solar power El Ni__o Childbirth What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

how do you keep a month old baby awake for a while during the day she will sleep most of the day and only like hours at night i try to keep her awake from pm til pm so she will sleep for a little while at night not having much luck what can i do i have a year old also i need sleep at night it's true that month old babies need a lot of sleep but they shouldn't be sleeping all day and only being active at night you will have to gradually switch her body clock around a full hours she is completely out of synch with you this will take weeks of consistent gritted teeth discipline you need to decide what time you want her to wake up every morning wake her up at that time rigorously every day and do everything you can to stimulate her brain to stay alert in daylight hours light is the key word the human brain responds strongly to the stimulus of light so turn the light on in her room take her out in the sunshine and set up her play area in a sunny spot in the lounge room you will also need to ensure she has plenty of brightly coloured noisy toys to play with music designed for small children is also a good idea as is face to face interaction lots of smiles talk laughter and singing your four year old can play an important role in this campaign by playing noisy games with the baby talking and singing to her and generally being an excellent role model if you have pets that are safe for her to interact with that would be a wonderful stimulus for her to stay awake and active exposure to tv and dvds videos should be limited to half an hour a day of programs purposely designed for small children you're probably wondering when you'll have time to do the housework and the answer is you won't but this is far more urgent your baby's language and general mental development is at a crucial stage and she needs to be interacting with the family my son got terribly bored at weeks and i couldn't work out what was wrong until his father set up a bouncinette with rattles and things hung above it he lay in that bouncinette and kicked and rattled like mad he wasn't able to crawl towards interesting things but when they were put within his reach he responded very strongly edit i forgot to mention feeding at one month she will probably still be feeding around the clock but over the next few months you can start limiting night time feeds a little as long as she's not screaming with hunger also don't play with her after night feeds just change her nappy and put her back to sleep keep your voice very low and hypnotic  Shaggy dog story Sleep Milton H.

why does my month old daughter always whine and make crying noises and struggles before she goes to sleep she's perfectly healthy we feed her enfamil lipel with iron if your child is not spitting up her formula or having excessive gas it is not the formula or because you are not breast feeding you do not have to breastfeed a child to be a good mom yes it is better for the babe but not required for a normal healthy child she is not spoiled and please don't let her cry herself to sleep that's so sad as the other ladies said sometimes rocking and just cuddling your baby is what she needs the human touch is the most soothing to a new baby as you feed her her last bottle at the end of her day softly talk to her or sing to her softly as you rock my singing voice would scare a gorilla but when i rock and i softly sing to my grandson when he is ready for his afternoon nap he takes the bottle and focuses on me when he stops sucking his bottle i continue to sing or humm and rock for or more minutes and then i lay him in his crib he sleeps soundly for hours his mom has taken to doing the same and said he sleeps much better now  Infant Sudden infant death syndrome Fertility awareness Infant formula Shaggy dog story Milk The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Childbirth About a Boy Baby bottle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hansel und Gretel The Flintstones Hypoglycemia Narcolepsy Cindy Sheehan Jon Secada Eric Cartman Avenue Q Cat Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Sleep The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Good Morning, Vietnam Phoebe Buffay's songs Mount Everest Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Breast milk EastEnders Bong Urinary incontinence Bart chalkboard gags Friends Great Teacher Onizuka Aquemini Recurring South Park characters International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Le Malade imaginaire Nestl__ boycott Domestic rabbit Time Out of Mind Mountain Gorilla 24 Hours of Le Mans Opportunity rover timeline for 2005 March Bringing It All Back Home The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Alena Rod Stewart Otello Blonde on Blonde Kim Possible Cliff Richard Yoko Ono Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Breast Little Britain Co-sleeping The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Protein-energy malnutrition Tupac Shakur Phil Hendrie Sea-Monkey Kodocha Siesta Knots Landing Pregnancy Lullaby The Amber Spyglass Polyphasic sleep Stewie Griffin Humphrey Bogart One Life to Live Lisa's First Word Family Guy Insomnia Charly Garc__a Chicken Characters in the Smurfs Frankie Laine Tag Housebreaking Sleep apnea Ron and Fez Hey Jude Charmed What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

breast feeding hell i have a newborn son weeks and i have always planned to breast feed my entire life during my pregnancy i realized it was going to be work after the birth of my son i started breast feeding him never any problems he fed well and my milk was in the problem is me i do not know why but i hate it i hate everything about it i hate that he wants to eat every hour it seems forever i do not know why i hate this all so much and why it all makes me so stressed out and it really does sometimes i cry i do not know what is wrong with me i feel like a horriable mother for this and please do not bash me i do not its the best thing i am just confused to why i am feeling this way over something like this what is wrong and i did but an electric breast pump from the hospital i tried pumping every night but its like i am not getting much it really sounds like you have the baby blues you don't have to feel sad all the time to have post partum depression you can be angry or anxious or tired or hate breast feeding your hormones are all out of whack right now because of giving birth ask your dr if he thinks you have post partum depression and if you really hate the breast feeding then don't do it it's not good for your baby to have a stressed out mom and it could hinder the bonding process if you feel resentment every time you nurse him they are making formulas better all the time and many babies grow up healthy and happy without being breast fed yes breast milk is best but not at the expense of your and the baby's happiness good luck  Infant Postpartum depression EastEnders Knots Landing Breast milk Abortion Kodocha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Urinary incontinence Breast Phoebe Buffay's songs Premature birth Milk Characters in the Smurfs Pregnancy Breast pump Transsexuality Guinea pig Hypoglycemia Friends Dairy Vernon Schillinger Fertility awareness Cindy Sheehan Clinical depression Pitaten Cytomegalovirus Shark Obstetrics W.I.T.C.H.

baby question i'm helping to take care of my sister's boyfriend's month nephew jj cause his mom is locked up for years grandma's working outta town for a minute and his dad won't claim him i don't have kids so i'm concerned about how much he should eat a day why when he gets something in his hand it goes straight to his mouth how early should we start gum and teeth care cause he has teeth so far and any other parenting advice i love having him here and just wanna make sure we're taking good care of him god bless as far as feeding goes he should be getting formula for the first year no milk until then however that should not be all he gets some people still have them on baby food by this point both of my children were eating soft grown up food by now at months he's probably somewhere in between the two so i would have both on hand just in case if you can take him to a doctor for a checkup as soon as you can the doctor will be able to tell you more specific information based on his size you should probably start working on getting him to use a sippy cup instead of a bottle if he isn't already it's recommended that they stop using a bottle by year and sometimes it takes a little bit to get them used to it at that age my kids both loved steamed vegetables very soft crackers and chicken cut up very small but you may want to check with the baby's mother to see what he likes as far as putting things in his mouth that's how babies explore try to vacuum every day if possible and keep small objects that may be swallowed out of his reach also if you haven't already get plug covers for your outlets my daughter is months older and she tries her best to find holes to stick things in you should probably get him a soft baby toothbrush and some fluorine free toothpaste they sell all kinds of baby toothpastes at any store try to get in the habit of brushing at least once a day preferably twice but as long as you don't give him tons of junk food it won't hurt too much if you forget occasionally i don't know how much time you have with him but give him as much attention as possible read to him frequently and don't use baby talk with him i spoke to my son like an adult as much as possible and was really surprised at how fast he learned to talk back the most important thing i have learned about being a parent is don't assume there is anything they can't do and don't assume until you've seen it that they can do anything either encourage him but don't push him give him the opportunity to try things that he should not be able to do until he's older but don't force him to do so that's how my son learned to read at and loves it good luck and i admire you for being willing to take on such a huge responsibility  Tooth Breastfeeding Kodocha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart About a Boy Milton H.

my month old is using my breast as a pacifier i have tried bottles and pacifiers but my son will not take either i am noticing that in order for him to go to sleep he has to be on my breast some of the times he is not even sucking when i pull him off he tries to get it back what can i do to break this habit there is a technique described in the no cry sleep solution by elizabeth pantley it involves unlatching a sleeping baby and when baby roots or wakes up allowing him to latch back on wait until baby is in deep sleep again and try again eventually he will accept being unlatched and will stay asleep lots of women say don't let him use you as a pacifier what did babies use for comfort sucking before the invention of pacifiers in the uk they're known as dummies because it's a false substitute for the real thing like a crash test dummy nursing for comfort is fine and babies are born with the drive to do so the best solution is to relax about it it won't last forever and when he is old enough to stay out all night you'll long for the safety and coziness of those late night nursing marathons if you don't have a command center you can make one the command center is what i called my nursing spot i had an all night nurser my record is hours in one day i had all the pillows in the house all the remotes the phone a book a glass of water a healthy snack and a bar of dark chocolate for emergencies only get comfortable put on some music and enjoy the nursing years we might as well enjoy it because we have to go through it no matter what  Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mattress Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Amber Spyglass Knots Landing M60 machine gun The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Jon Secada STS-61 Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story Ocean's Twelve Childbirth Hamster The Shining (film) Social rule The Beatles discography Sleep Coffee Avenue Q Out-of-body experience Macbeth Jam (TV series) Insomnia Humphrey Bogart AFI 100 Years series Owen Hart Narcolepsy Sukkot Friends Hera Fertility awareness Pacifier Lucid dreaming Neighbours Glass Something Positive The Inside Donald Neilson Conker's Bad Fur Day First aid The Curse of Fenric Infant Black Sabbath Cruising (maritime) Undergarment Housebreaking History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Characters in the Smurfs Sin City Drawn Together Ron and Fez Saturday Night Live Apollo 8 Characters of The Sandman Crash test dummy Sudden infant death syndrome Aphrodite 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Days of our Lives Opportunity rover timeline for 2005 March Billboard Hot 100 Lisa's First Word Indianapolis 500 Naval mine The Tracey Ullman Show shorts 9/11 conspiracy theories Bryan Adams What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

help spoiled baby so im a first time mother dont have my own mother around to help and assist me and basically teaching myself and of course learning as i go along of course i've been given advice all different fr different people pick her up u cant spoil a newborn let her cry for a while she'll get smart and learn how to take advantage you dont have to bathe her everyday she's still young make sure you bathe her every night around the same time get her used to a routine it's better for her and it'll make it easier for you of course confused trying to learn on my own and tried everything suggested my baby girl now almost mnths next week is only good about going to sleep after her bath i did the routint thing that definately helped but all she wants is to be carried and only by me omg is this just a phase and what can i do to unspoil her i'm not good at letting her cry i've actually done that but she just cries and cries for as long as half an hour also breastfeeding i used to pump and give her bottles as well as my breast she'd refuse at first then finally take it but now she doesnt take it at all i need her to use the bottle bc i need to go back to work in a month or so any help about that would be greatly appreciated hugs this job is hard you will find out what works for you and remember that everything is just a phase with kids everyone has advice to give but at the end of the day you need to trust your instincts and do what works best for your family ok so here's my advice to add to the list you can't spoil a baby developmentally they can't understand that they are a separate person from you until they are months old you are her whole world right now and she looks to you for comfort and security she is not trying to take advantage of you or manipulate you she is trying to tell you something when she cries she doesn't have words to say mommy i'm scared right now and dont' want to be alone most moms aren't good at letting babies cry we are programmed to try and meet their needs have you thought about trying a sling or a baby carrier i have one i really like from www kimzkreations com that way she can be close to you when she's fussy and you can have your hands free to get stuff done when she falls asleep you can transfer her to her bed so you can get a break routines are good for babies but it depends on how old your baby is the younger they are the more flexible you have to be for me around mos i tracked my son's patterns that he naturally falls into and then i built my routines around that also keep in mind that your routines will have to change as baby grows and her needs change as far as the bottle thing goes can you get someone to give her a bottle of pumped milk once a day sometimes babies don't want to take a bottle from mom because they want the real thing lol try doing it the same time each day so she knows to expect it just be consistant and she will figure it out you can also try another type of bottle the breastflow bottles by first years are designed for nursing babies and they are the only ones my son would take they are available at babies r us i can tell you are a great mom because you trying your hardest to do the best job you can hang in there it does get a little easier  Breastfeeding Childbirth Social rule Infant Humphrey Bogart Milk Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jon Secada Fertility awareness Friends EastEnders The Catcher in the Rye Dog training Shaggy dog story A Course In Miracles Milton H.

do you think doctors or the government has the right to intimidate young women into breastfeeding their babies no doubt that breastfeeding is better but does anyone have the right to intimate women and make the ones who are not able to breastfeed feel inferior i think it is ridiculous it is a woman's choice i dont necesarily think it is the doctors who always do the intimidating i feel alot of mothers do it too those who choose not to breastfeed or just simply cant feel as tho they always have to explain to others why their choice is valid i dont think it should be so pushed upon mothers to do so like you said its a woman's choice and a personal one amen sista  Breastfeeding Fertility awareness Pregnancy Childbirth Domestic violence Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Abortion debate Gender role Childfree Relative clause Infant Abortion in Canada Roe v.

breastfeeding baby poop ok this is actually more than just a poo question it is a long story bear with me and thanks in advance my six week old son has just recently days has had the normal yellow seedy poop but with a little mucus in it i read up on it allover the net and seems he may have an allergy or sensitivity from what i gather it says on most sites to contact the pediatrician well his doc is very unsupportive of breastfeeding and i plan to switch doctors after his month shots none of the other docs can get me in until long after these are due and i don't want to jepordize him getting these we have had issues with slow weight gain but for the past weeks he hs gained ounces a week but is still a little small for weeks he is happy and dosen't seem to be in any pain whatsoever he sleeps good and has plenty of wet diapers his doc allready triedd to get me to supplement even gave me free formula which i wanted to throw at her i of course refused the offer and kept b f i feel like she is not goin to help at all and will probably hassle me about his weight and make me feel incompetent shes very uneducated in the b f field and has given me a lot of poor info what would you do i'd never do anything to jepordize my baby should i just slowly elimnate foods or could this be more serious even though he smiles and seems very comfortable even during these bowel movements help your pediatrician is unsupportive of breast feeding get rid of this person this is an old fashioned and dangerous attitude also if you can't get your baby to another doctor for a check up say that he is sick mucous in a diaper should be enough to get you in for health reasons many doctors schedule well baby checkups in advance to reserve space for sick kids you should check this out if your child is sick breast milk is the best thing for him shots can wait shots should wait if your baby might be sick if fact if your baby has a stomach bug he cannot be immunized i didn't immunize my daughter until she was because she had cousins who had seizures when immunized as infants my daughter had a hard time gaining weight too your pediatrician should be helping you to solve this not giving you a bad time i did have to supplement for a short time but there are many formulas to choose from i chose an organic brand with no hormones with the advice of a lactation specialist and counselors at la leche i never would have taken the free sample just because it was free so i understand why you wanted to throw it at her i actually did fire my baby's first pediatrician because of his narrow minded views follow your gut on this maternal instinct is real as long as your baby isn't losing weight there's little to worry about if he seems happy and has plenty of wet diapers there are many techniques to increase your own milk supply which made it so i no longer had to supplement contact a lactation specialist at any hospital and the la leche league they have plenty of good sound proven advice on breast feeding hurdles  Childbirth Urinary incontinence Milk Infantilism Fertility awareness Infant formula EastEnders Cancer Tocopherol Hypoglycemia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fecal incontinence Stomach cancer Breast Protein-energy malnutrition Diarrhea Cat Guinea pig Chronic fatigue syndrome Allergy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pregnancy Diaper Theory of conduct Nipple Poker jargon Cytomegalovirus Nutrition Nestl__ boycott History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Nipple piercing Prolactin Social rule Publicly funded medicine Vitamin D Breast milk Crohn's disease Coeliac disease Brassiere Health insurance Abortion Premature birth Omega-3 fatty acid Insulin Breast pump Recurring South Park characters Dieting Ulcerative colitis The Shining (film) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Clinical depression Sharon Tate Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Atkins Nutritional Approach Kodocha Pediatrics Controversies in autism Medicine Days of our Lives Medical prescription Medical analysis of circumcision Night (book) Pitaten Apollo 8 Conker's Bad Fur Day Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Psoriasis Traumatic brain injury YuYu Hakusho Anorexia nervosa Malaria The Catcher in the Rye Tuberculosis Prenatal diagnosis Equine conformation Joke Ayurveda Insomnia Radiation therapy Charmed Boston Public Mattress Traumatic incident reduction Transsexuality Sin City Jaundice

my neice this giving my great neice mo old oz of cereal goo every bottle it just doesn't sound rite to me my kids are grown but i dont ever remember giving anything like that is it just me or is it to much every baby is different i started my baby with cereal in her bottle at three months because she was a fairly large baby at birth so she ate more than other babys at her age doctors want you to hold off until the baby is atleast months and to start off with tbs per oz of formula so if her month old is drinking oz of milk your niece needs to only measure in tablespoons of cereal if you truly feel as though she is giving the baby too much cereal in her bottle you may want to suggest spoon feeding the cereal to the baby from a bowl instead of through a bottle that way the baby can get her nutritional needs from the formula and get her full from the cereal seperately and will stop eating when he she's full the cereal can get too thick and it will be really hard to suck through that little hole in the nipple and if she does decide this don't forget the baby still needs her bottle of formula along with the cereal i am just a little confused though is she giving her baby a oz bottle of formula with cereal or oz of cereal in her bottle of formula if it is truly a whole oz of cereal in her bottle then hell yes it is too much that baby is about to burst  Breastfeeding Infant Elephant Infant formula Milk Trailer Park Boys Breakfast Nestl__ Coeliac disease Breakfast cereal Childbirth Bong Food Little Britain Scooby-Doo Nestl__ boycott Friends Sea-Monkey Homer Simpson Treehouse of Horror IX Humphrey Bogart Russian cuisine Guinea pig Peruvian cuisine Alcoholic beverage Kosher foods Cereal Drink Fecal incontinence Kodocha Indianapolis 500 Cheerios Folic acid Tasmanian Devil Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Bread Stomach cancer The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Flintstones The Super Milk-chan Show Knots Landing Coffee Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Fancy rat Piccolo Junior Saga Champagne (beverage) Soybean Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Salad Fingers Prolactin Cap'n Crunch Joke EastEnders Happy Meal B-47 Stratojet Diarrhea Spoon Premature birth Cat Urinary incontinence Ron Weasley Bart chalkboard gags Generation Y Nipple Characters in the Smurfs Social rule Soft drink RuneScape quests Wine Russian joke Yoko Ono Maize Kyle Broflovski Ben Johnson (athlete) Veganism Phoebe Buffay's songs Blue Whale Maple syrup Food preservation Rice Krispies Soy milk Rice John the Baptist Metrication Charmed Shaggy dog story Cuisine of Malaysia Vegetarianism Mnemonic Weetabix Vitasoy Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Treehouse of Horror XII Soap bubble Futurama (TV series - season 5) Vampire Olive oil John Harvey Kellogg

do you use a d ointment or something similar at every diaper change even if there's no rash in other words do you use a d as a preventative or simply as a treatment once a rash has occurred i read someone else's post on here and she implied she used it at every diaper change just curious to know if this is standard or not the first few days after birth even weeks the baby can have lots of bm's so we like to use it every time after that i like to let the baby's skin breathe a little if the baby has thrush it's important to not use it for every diaper change as the baby's skin needs exposure to the air as much as possible i like to put it on at night and when i leave her with one of my teenagers they may not be so quick to realize she needs a change it is both a preventative and it helps heal after trying several we found that a d works better than the others on an existing rash lots of the others seemed to sting when applied  Diaper Psoriasis Candidiasis Rash Zinc Urinary incontinence Eczema Coeliac disease Fecal incontinence Group A streptococcal infection Syphilis Cytomegalovirus Lupus erythematosus Scabies Decompression sickness Mercury (element) Acne Lyme disease Rocky Mountain spotted fever Witchcraft Breastfeeding Spina bifida Allergy Radiation therapy Infant Homeopathy Sunburn Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hyperthermia Herpes simplex virus First aid Stomach cancer Transsexuality Premature birth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Anthrax Tattoo Skin Professional wrestling match types Malignant melanoma Hay fever Prostate cancer Pregnancy Tarantula Hulk (comics) Identity and change Rooibos Scar Herpes zoster Ayurveda Family Guy Childbirth Asthma Shen Gong Wu Hormone replacement therapy (trans) American English Diving suit Abortion debate Pneumonia Kimberly-Clark Corporation Monkeypox Demographics Spanking A Course In Miracles Traumatic brain injury Static Shock Congenital disorder EastEnders Leather Cephalic disorder Gonorrhoea Reiki Michael Savage (commentator) Rasheed Wallace Beryllium Characters in the Smurfs Wound healing phases Diabetes mellitus Aloe Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Anal fissure Lanolin Mouth ulcer Ageplay Doomsday argument Jon Secada Rugrats Stinging nettle Smallpox Expository preaching Lisp programming language Fatality Circumcision Schistosoma mansoni Second language acquisition Extreme Programming Cancer

is it ok to stop breastfeeding your newborn if so then why do i feel like such a horrible person i stopped trying to breastfeed when my daughter was weeks old it wasn't working for us for many reasons my milk wasn't as plentiful as she would have liked and my year old son always acting up when i tried to feed her knowing i wasn't as fast to get up and put him in time out were two of the main reasons she would get frusterated at the lack of milk at first and then she just stopped trying after a few days i feel like i am a horrible mom for not trying longer but the truth is it was making life hard for us both and i was a weepy mess i love her so much and wanted to give her all the best i wanted to be the type of mom who breastfed their child until the child weaned like or now i feel like she was cheated what is your opinion on this my little girl is only weeks days now so that's why i am still so sad where are all the peoples answers that gave the thumbs down there is only one it's not ok answer but some peoples answers have thumbs down i want honesty here even if it hurts don't beat yourself up about it breastfeeding just isn't for every woman and that doesn't make you a bad mom just as women who do breastfeed shouldn't look down on women who don't as if they are better you tried to and that's all that matters i breastfeed my little girl for the first week or so too the first few days of trying were horrible b c she wouldn't latch on right and she wasn't getting enough to eat which meant she was constantly crying so then i started trying to pump but my breasts just wouldn't produce that much i finally decided to just give up on it b c she had began losing weight all that mattered to me was that my daughter was finally eating and healthy breastfeeding may be less expensive and better for the baby but i think bottle feeding it more convenient and helps give mommy a break b c daddy can help feed too so don't feel bad about it b c you love your child and that's all that matters  Social rule Theory of conduct Kodocha Shaggy dog story Infant Knots Landing EastEnders Friends Milk Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fertility awareness Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pregnancy Childbirth Pitaten Fiddler on the Roof Charmed Breast pump Scenes from a Memory Ben Johnson (athlete) One Tree Hill (TV series) Infantilism Theodicy Breast milk Jon Secada Infant formula Ron and Fez Poker jargon Hey Jude The Fairly OddParents YuYu Hakusho Phoebe Buffay's songs The Emancipation of Mimi Piccolo Junior Saga Jaundice The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Frankie Laine Kyle Broflovski Nipple piercing Kurt Cobain Street-Legal Kibbutz About a Boy Ranma __ characters Days of our Lives She Loves You Tupac Shakur Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Little Britain The Amber Spyglass Mina Mongoose The Ashlee Simpson Show Characters in the Smurfs 2000 Australian Grand Prix Smallville (Season 4) International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Bon Jovi Transactional analysis Blonde on Blonde The Contender (television series) Father Ted Le Malade imaginaire The Apprentice 2 Prolactin The nature of God in Western theology Sin City Samuel Goldwyn Marilyn Monroe Baby bottle Alena Year of the Spider Indianapolis 500 Cliff Richard The Adventures of Pete & Pete Oasis (band) House of M Spice Girls Humphrey Bogart Plame affair Montreal Screwjob Something Positive History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Eddie Guerrero True Crime: Streets of LA The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Yoko Ono Joke The Death Gate Cycle Incarnations of Immortality Laura Schlessinger

my month old refuses to sleep on his back any advice i tried tricking him into sleeping on his back by letting him sleeping in my arms for mins before laying him down he'll sleep for a max of hours before realizing he's on his back and wake up screaming i've tried everything swing carseat boppy placing him on his side with a towel or blanket infront and behind him i even bought a foam to make him feel snug and giving him a little cereal he rolled over at days old and again at a week old and hasn't stopped since i think placing the blankets and foam makes him feel restricted i can place him on his back oneway only to find him facing the oppisite way when i check on him i even found him in the corner of the bed on his stomach with one arm hanging off when he's on his stomach i roll him back over onto his back only to him awaking up screaming refusing to go back to sleep no matter how tired he is i've read all the articles on sids and done the research is there anything i haven't tried that may work help sorry i worded my question wrong and as unbelieveable as it may sound yes my baby did roll over at days and also a week old even the nurse couldn't believe her eyes when he was in the hospital for jaundice my son had jaundice when he was born and had to stay in the hospital after i was discharged for days they had him under the special light on his tummy in just a diaper pretty much constantly for those days except for feedings needless to say once we brought him home from the hospital he hated to be swaddled and would not stay asleep on his back we made the decision to let him sleep on his tummy he took a pacifier shown to help prevent sids and just made sure there was no loose bedding or anything he was born in the winter so those blanket sleepers worked great instead of a blanket my son is a healthy month old even though he didn't sleep on his back like he was supposed to babies usually start rolling over at months anyway and some will roll on to their tummies no matter how you put them to sleep i'm sure your baby will be fine just make sure there are no pillows or animals in the bed and have a monitor just in case if you're really worried they have a baby monitor that has a sensor mat you put under the bedding if it detects no movement or breathing for seconds an alarm will beep good luck  Mattress Breastfeeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sudden infant death syndrome Sleep Shaggy dog story Knots Landing Stomach cancer EastEnders Sin City Care Bears Urinary incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kurt Cobain Milton H.

tummy time my month old son hates tummy time every time i put him on a blanket on the floor for tummy time he does nothing but cry should i just let him cry while down there or what i tried laying him on my stomach and do tummy time and he hates that too i mean he has his moments where he will be fine for a few min but then he starts to cry any ideas or advice thanks don't worry if your son resists a daily quota of tummy time many young babies don't like it because it is very limiting as far as what it allows them to see and do when your son is on hisback he can wave his arms and legs twist his torso and see all around him but when he is on his stomach he has to work very hard to keep his head up can use only his arms for support and is unable to move his legs much one way that you can make it more pleasant for him is by putting him on his tummy on the floor or bed and then lying on your stomach so that you're face to face with him get close and be a little silly he might be entertained and may lean his head on yours for support you can also offer him a little unbreakable mirror in which to admire himself when he looks down or play a musical mobile to encourage him to pull his head up as your son's neck gets stronger tummy time should become more comfortable for him but if he remains unhappy when you put him down skip it babyhood is not a race if he crawls four weeks later than his peers it doesn't matter now and it certainly won't matter later  Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling holds Swingout Breastfeeding Equine conformation Diving Comanche Professional wrestling aerial techniques Breaststroke Conspiracy (TNG episode) Babe Ruth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Milton H.

is there any state in which breastfeeding in public is illegal no however in some states like texas private businesses can use the claim that they have the right to refuse business to anyone in many states legislature is being discussed as it is on the federal level to change this so hopefully soon there will be a federal law stating that a woman can breastfeed wherever she the child are entitled to legally be plus she cannot be asked to cover up go to the bathroom or leave in the event that a complaint is made based solely on the fact that she is breastfeeding i'm sure they word it more legal than that but that's the proposed meaning check w your state and find out what's going on there sign petitions email representatives be active about it and on the health hazard thing if osha does not consider it a biohazard then no one else can so if this ever happens to you fight it if a restaurant tries to stop you it's because someone stupid has complained that they don't want their husband looking at you they should be the ones to be relocated to a different section of the restaurant breastmilk even the milk of a stranger is not a health hazard  Breastfeeding Occupational Safety and Health Administration Childbirth Whistleblower Same-sex marriage in the United States Child pornography Controlled Substances Act Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Supreme Court of the United States Judicial review E-mail spam Intelligent design movement Article One of the United States Constitution Treaty Ice hockey Same-sex marriage in Canada Health insurance Constitution of Ireland Tom DeLay Head of state Government of Australia Nuclear option (filibuster) Town meeting Jury Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Cannabis rescheduling in the United States United States Postal Service Evan Mecham Hazardous material Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Civil rights Gay rights Lawrence v.

i think my son is going through separation anxiety during his nap times but i'm not sure this has just recently started this week he is mths old when he goes down for a nap he is asleep and then mins into his nap he is waking up screaming if i stand there and rub pat his back he will fall back to sleep but i refuse to do that everytime he naps if i don't rub pat his back then he will just keep screaming until i finally go in and just get him up and say forget the nap we are both very stressed out help why do you refuse to do that every time he naps i don't mean that rudely but if that works and allows him to nap and you to get work done then what's the harm eventually he will not take naps any more so it isn't like you are going to be rubbing his back for more years he obviously is feeling some anxiety about being away from you and he needs you to reassure him that you are still there as long as you aren't picking him up i think a few back rubs to reassure him are appropriate  Shaggy dog story Siesta Polyphasic sleep Blitzball Jam (TV series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Narcolepsy Knots Landing Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March New Alliance Party Futurama (TV series - season 5) Nap Lajoie Urinary incontinence Anxiety The Amber Spyglass Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe New York Giants Dilbert Miss Saigon Salad Fingers Philosophical skepticism Oakland Athletics Cat Social rule The Stone Roses Lucid dreaming Memorial Stadium, Clemson Mattress Sleep paralysis General anxiety disorder Pok__mon Live!

to all ladies who have delivered a baby vaginally i went to a childbirth preparation class with my husband a few weeks ago and the instructor said that when i get to the stage during labor when the baby is crowning that there might come a point where the doctor will ask me if i want an episiotomy or if i want to try to push her out naturally and risk tearing so my question is is it common to tear or need an episiotomy to get the baby out and if it is then which one would did you choose i know this can be a touchy subject but i am really concerned about it and the best way for me to allay my fears is to hear from women who have gone through it already starting around weeks you could try massaging your perineum the area around your vagina daily perineal massage may increase the area's stretching ability leading to less need for an episiotomy and fewer natural tears try this technique yourself with clean hands and trimmed nails or have your partner do it for you if you're going solo have a large mirror handy so you can see what you're doing and to help familiarize yourself with your perineal area sit in a semi reclined position in a warm comfortable area spreading your legs apart lubricate your fingers thumbs and perineal area with vitamin e oil from punctured vitamin e capsules pure vegetable oil or personal lubricant don't use baby oil mineral oil or petroleum jelly place your thumbs about to inches to or just past your first knuckle inside your vagina and spread your legs press down toward the rectum and toward the sides at the same time gently and firmly continue stretching until you feel a slight burn or tingling hold this stretch for about two minutes until the tingling starts to subside now slowly and gently massage the lower part of the vagina back and forth hooking your thumbs onto the sides of your vagina and gently pulling the tissue forward as your baby's head will do during delivery keep this up for three to four minutes finally massage the tissue between the thumb and forefinger back and forth for about a minute be gentle because a vigorous touch could cause bruising or swelling during the massage avoid pressure on the urethra urinary opening as this can lead to irritation or infection of course perineal massage isn't for everyone and it may not help in every case the most important thing you can do is to choose a midwife or doctor who's experienced and comfortable delivering babies without doing episiotomies in general midwives tend to perform this surgery less often than physicians regardless of the type of practitioner you choose discuss your wishes and expectations with that person before the birth  Prostate cancer Intersex surgery Anal sex Massage Fecal incontinence Fisting Female genital cutting Professional wrestling holds Condom Strap-on dildo Carpal tunnel syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Masturbation Androgen insensitivity syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) First aid Milton H.

i have a month old that has been vomitting for a few weeks everytime he eats he throw up about times he never cries when he throws up i took him to the doctor and told me that it was reflux but i'm not convinced it sounds like what your doctor told you is right i had that problem with my son when he was about weeks old even though they are too little at that age to eat food the doctor told me to put one teaspoon of rice cereal in his bottle for every ounce of formula you give him this helps to thicken up the formula so that it is easier for them to keep it down also after feeding him keep him sitting up and no pressure on his belly for about a half an hour afterwords this does help my son is now months and rarely throws up anymore also once you start feeding solids and less formula it gets better on it's own you might need to talk to the doctor to switch formula's usually switching to soy helps the throwing up too but use that as a last resort because it can sometimes be hard on a baby's belly to switch formulas hope this helps  Breastfeeding Stomach cancer Gastroparesis Urinary incontinence Coeliac disease Infant formula Fancy rat Gastroesophageal reflux disease Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Adjustable gastric band Bread Shaggy dog story Soybean Caffeine Sea-Monkey New Coke Hamster Aerial (dance move) Dog training Milk Trailer Park Boys One Piece minor characters Suplex IP (complexity) Kodocha Rice pudding Terri Schiavo Japanese cuisine Jackass: The Movie Nestl__ Fecal incontinence Rais massacre Fire fighting Cheese Little Britain Soy milk Phoebe Halliwell Peanut Drawn Together Piccolo Junior Saga Soy sauce Jam (TV series) Anorexia nervosa Medical prescription Cantonese cuisine Kitten Fertility awareness Esophageal cancer Yom Kippur War The Empty Child Wheel of Fortune Botulism Social rule John Sheridan (Babylon 5) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe John the Baptist Prostate cancer Ben Johnson (athlete) Guinea pig Veganism Quaker Oats Company Flour Tofu Breakfast cereal Hypoglycemia Nestl__ boycott Humphrey Bogart Ron and Fez The Amber Spyglass Bottlenose Dolphin Rod Stewart Vermicompost Hannibal Lecter Poker jargon Vegetarianism Toilet humour The Curse of Fenric Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Food Idli Infant Big Brother UK series 6 The Dalek Invasion of Earth John Harvey Kellogg Boom Town (Doctor Who) Big Brother (USA TV series) Mayonnaise Garfield Professional wrestling holds Food allergy Kellogg Company Le Malade imaginaire Days of our Lives Diarrhea Folic acid Alcoholics Anonymous The Shining (film) Capercaillie

my baby is months and when do i start feeding her yea so im a little confused about the stage foods i've seen mom's feed their month olds gerber foods and i think thats young im feeding her oz every hours and im changing it to oz cuz shes a lil chunky monkey but neways i just want experiences on what age you start feeding them gerbers i've heard ideally months right generally you can start solids when the baby is over months old and doesn't seem satisfied by oz of formula a day if your baby is satisfied by current feedings until she's months that's totally okay you start with baby cereal pick one and start with that for a week mixing it to a runny consistency with formula so that the taste isn't totally foreign you don't move on from cereals until you've tried all of them then you can start with the jarred foods it's always better to start with green veggies rather than fruits or sweet vegetables like carrots or sweet potatoes babies really like sweet stuff you change stages textures as your baby is ready all of this is a general guideline your baby may progress sooner or later and that's normal  Breastfeeding Bread Japanese cuisine Hamster Nestl__ boycott Soybean Breakfast Peruvian cuisine Jewish cuisine Potato Gerber Products Company Domestic rabbit German cuisine MRE Phoebe Buffay's songs Snack food Tofu Bengali cuisine Sweet potato Dietary fiber Chocolate Food Carrot Russian cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Food preservation Always Be My Baby Cereal Bart chalkboard gags Cuisine of Denmark Cuisine of Singapore Guinea pig Wheel of Fortune Cuisine of Brazil Banana Agriculture Rationing in the United Kingdom during and after World War II Cannabis cultivation Cuisine of the Southern United States Maize Terri Schiavo Fancy rat Capercaillie Pancake Sea-Monkey Infant formula Polish cuisine Full English breakfast Cuisine of Africa Cantonese cuisine Vegetarianism Plantain Kodocha Fertility awareness Vegetarian cuisine Food guide pyramid Pizza Vitamin C Cheese Billboard Hot 100 Ice cream Antioxidant Breakfast cereal The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Sugar substitute Dorama Root vegetable Tempura Folic acid Overpopulation Potato chips Daz Dillinger Cuisine of Malaysia Jon Secada Yoghurt Domesticated turkey Genetically modified food Kit Kat Confectionery Frankie Laine Organic food Barbecue Shaggy dog story Futurama (TV series - season 5) Green Day Sorghum Fasting Saturday Night Live Dumpling Rice pudding Onion Ant Kyle Broflovski Soy milk Wine Black pepper Infant Compost

is it possible for an hiv positive mother on antiretroviral drugs to breastfeed her baby for three months if an hiv positive mother breastfeeds her baby for the first three months can the child contract the virus yes the virus can be transmitted through breast milk why in the world would any mother be willing to risk her newborn's health like that when there is perfectly good formula available that is one of the most irresponsible things i have ever heard of the child's health should be the mom's first priority which is why most mother's breast feed however in this case breast feeding is actually putting the baby at a huge risk which is just selfish the drugs do not cure hiv they just manage the disease it turns it into a chronic illness that must be managed instead of an automatic death sentence who wants their child to start off their lives with a chronic illness maybe the risk is lower due to the drugs but it's still there  HIV Breastfeeding AIDS Infant Cytomegalovirus Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Duesberg hypothesis AIDS pandemic Milk Childbirth Herpes simplex virus Hepatitis C Antiretroviral drug AIDS reappraisal HIV vaccine Nestl__ boycott Timeline of AIDS Medical analysis of circumcision Premature birth Chagas disease Hypoglycemia International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Gonorrhoea Tuberculosis Haloperidol Sexually-transmitted infection Folic acid Mastitis Virus Diarrhea H5N1 Pneumonia Fertility awareness Breast cancer Multiple sclerosis Vitamin D Antiviral drug Hepatitis Chronic fatigue syndrome Avian influenza Foodborne illness Food and Drug Administration Hormone replacement therapy (trans) HIV Disease Progression Rates Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Rabies Coeliac disease Urinary incontinence Influenza Rocky Mountain spotted fever Oral sex Jaundice Prolactin Palliative care Docosahexaenoic acid Circumcision Pandemic United Nations Children's Fund Ulcerative colitis Breast pump Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus Methamphetamine Prolactinoma West Nile virus Mumps Crystal methamphetamine and sex Toxoplasmosis Crohn's disease Health insurance Common cold Primidone Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Protein-energy malnutrition Newborn screening Angelina Jolie Dairy Tocopherol Prostate cancer Zidovudine Prenatal diagnosis Lassa fever Spanish flu Group A streptococcal infection Fibromyalgia Abortion Pornographic movie Safe sex Livestock Cephalic disorder Lung cancer Gastroesophageal reflux disease Chronic

breastfeeding hi everyone i am wks preg and i am planning on breastfeeding i have a strange question to ask about it i know the benefits of it however i have some of my friends have insisted that their breasts were never the same for example one of my friends says that they are now lopsided another says one is bigger than the other another says her nipples are all messed up and yet another feels like they were stretched out so much that she is going to get them fixed i am just wondering how much of this is true or are they just exaggerating i just want to be prepared for the worst does breastfeeding really ruin your breasts i'd love to hear from moms who have breastfeed thanks hello there first of all i would like to congratulate you on making the wise and wonderful decision to breastfeed your baby it shows that you have really done your homework and that you are really dedicated to giving your baby the very best good for you i just want to tell you that every day they find new and wonderful things that breastmilk can do for you and for your baby it amazes me and i have been studying breastfeeding and all that it entails for about years did you know that just your colostrum alone protects your baby against potentially fatal diseases no kidding i can not imagine any loving responsible mother who would chose not to breastfeed unless there was a clear cut medical reason why she could not anyway back to your question i can only tell you that in my experience and it has been extensive the answer is no breastfeeding does not ruin your breasts i am sure that if you were to investigate a bit more closely you would find that the women who insisted that breastfeeding had ruined their breasts had probably gained a significant amount of weight over and above the recommended lbs it is weight gain and subsequent rapid weight loss that takes a toll on your breasts not breastfeeding to be precise i guess i should say it is weight loss that really does it when you lose or pounds while it may have been necessary it leaves your breasts noticably less firm and just changed from the way they were when you had the extra weight i don't think that there is any way around that i breastfed four babies until they were between and months old and it certainly never hurt the appearance of my breasts at all that is of course the only personal up close knowledge that i have other than that i know what women have told me and what i have observed in the many women that i have helped with breastfeeding issues i think that the bottom line is if pregnancy weight gain and breastfeeding are going to make changes in your breasts there is little that you can do about it heredity and your personal body size and shape have a lot to do with it if you are concerned i would say that you should keep your weight gain within the normal range and not go on any crash diets to try to lose weight after you are done breastfeeding rapid weight loss makes a big difference all in all i have to say that when looking at the effects that breastfeeding may or may not have on your breasts the bottom line is that the benefits of breastfeeding far and away are more significant than any changes to the appearance of your breasts i am not saying that it does not matter vanity they name is woman but it is surely not the most important thing lets face it pregnancy itself makes a difference in the way your body is going to look but we do not decide not to have babies it is part of the whole package i guess it is probably different for each woman but in my experience it is not breastfeeding that changes the shape and size of a woman's breasts but rather rapid weight loss and pregnancy itself have a wonderful time breastfeeding your little one you have a wonderful adventure ahead of you remember to get lots of rest eat and drink when the baby does and take good care of yourself the same way you did when you were pregnant feel free to write to me if you have any questions i would be happy to help take care and enjoy the wonderful time ahead of you love and blessings lady trinity  Fertility awareness Folic acid Abortion debate Social rule Theory of conduct Pregnancy

how much would you pay someone how much would you pay a neighbor to watch your month old from pm to am she is sleeping throught the night and we live in an apartment building right next to each other i don't want to be cheap but i also do not have alot of money how much would you pay them it will be for a few nights a week when hubby and i both have to work i am thinking maybe every two weeks if she watches her less than six times if more than a night please give me some insight on this i know that they are responsible for her and watching her just the same even though she is sleeping i was thinking every two weeks it may be up to nights a week though is this enough hesperia paying minimum wage i would barely be bringing any thing home what would be the point of working most of the time she will get to sleep as well as our daughter i know it can get rough at night but we will try and see how it goes and pay more or less if need be also if baby is sick then i am not going to go into worok that night i would be calling in sick to take care of her not making someone else do it i am in the process of trying to switch shifts nothing has come up yet though thanks to everyone who gives honest realistic answers this is just to get an idea for me i think if it is ur neighbor and ur friend a night should be just fine or every two weeks as long as ur not going over or nights i think if you pay more than that it would defeat the idea of you working does that make sense and like i said if you trust this person to take care of ur child than ur most likely friends and she'll understand and wouldn't think ur jipping her so i think u did well  Theory of conduct EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Avenue Q Day care Friends Socrates Cindy Sheehan Jon Secada 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Satchel Paige Sharon Tate Night (book) The Pilgrim's Progress Trainspotting (novel) The Catcher in the Rye Ocean's Twelve Pregnancy Michael Garibaldi Rule of St Benedict Time Out of Mind Education in Germany Jiddu Krishnamurti Religious Society of Friends Unemployment Miss Saigon Social rule About a Boy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Microeconomics Current teachings of Prem Rawat Family Feud Animism Poker jargon Simone Weil 50 First Dates Philosophical skepticism Matins Wal-Mart American individualist anarchism Kurt Cobain Philosophy of language Eddie Guerrero Unemployment benefit One Tree Hill (TV series) Supply and demand Year of the Spider Marilyn Monroe American Psycho Negima Anderson Cooper Abortion debate Blankets (graphic novel) Urinary incontinence The nature of God in Western theology Anarchism and capitalism The Lovely Bones David Hume Alois Hitler She Loves You Labour economics Blood Simple Economics Major League Baseball television contracts Keynesian economics Wheel of Fortune Eric Bischoff Athrun Zala Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Chess (musical) Religion Melanie Wilkes Taxation in the United States Traumatic brain injury Haibane Renmei Garfield What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

why are moms who don't want to breastfeed looked down upon i didn't ever want to because it hurt it should be a choice i read online how hospitals are refusing to give formula to newborn babies at some of them right they will lose a lot of business it should be a mother's right to choose why would a hospital have that right they are only involved in the first hours of care sounds to me like they just don't want to spend the money on formula and are using this as a way out so what is your opinion on this matter yes that's true about bringing your own formula to the hospital but it sounds like the hospitals aren't even letting this wow i didn't realize it was as heated as it is lot of strong opinions i am surprised people should have a choice i don't care what you think is best for me only i know what is best for me women should support each other despite the fact they might not make the same decisions i think it is terrible how some of these people act when you say you didn't breastfeed so what if you didn't the only thing that matters in the long run is if your baby is happy and healthy  Breastfeeding Theory of conduct Childbirth EastEnders Shaggy dog story The Apprentice 2 Pitaten Knots Landing Humphrey Bogart Time Out of Mind Abortion debate Paradox Characters in the Smurfs 2000 Australian Grand Prix Infant Fertility awareness Jon Secada Social rule 24 Hours of Le Mans Mother Teresa Marilyn Monroe One Tree Hill (TV series) The Contender (television series) Street-Legal Lorelai Gilmore Abortion in the United States Theodicy Philosophical skepticism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Ty Cobb Grandview, U.S.A.

what can be done to encourage new moms this is open to all moms we all know that bf'ing should be the norm but it's not if you formula fed your baby what do you think would have helped you make a decision to breastfeed if you breast fed what was a major contribution to this decision be detailed i'd really like to know what your experiences have been some really interesting and good answers so far i just want to add that in response to booboo's question about why i'd like to know is that i'd like irl to help moms who are having trouble without making them feel judged or defensive knowing what has stood in the way or what has been beneficial to others can help me be more empathetic and helpful hope that answers your question we all know the benefits of breastfeeding i think we should spread the word about it without bashing formula feeding moms we get nowhere putting someone else down i had to supplement with formula for about a month until i started producing enough milk i hated that my lactation consultant looked down on me because of it the only thing i could think about was that it wasn't her starving baby so why should she judge me i think we should support without judging that is key it looks really bad when your trying to teach and help someone and you bash the only other option there is to feed your baby the second thing to do would be to be as honest as we can be i was determined to breastfeed and thought it would come naturally and that my body would know how much milk to make for my son it didn't i did have to supplement with formula for three weeks or a month i'll say a month because it did seem like a while breastfeeding is very difficult for first time moms and you must be informed about the difficulties that some will face with beastfeeding and the commitment that comes along with it it doesn't matter how informed you are you must understand that just because a friend had an easy time with bf it doesn't mean you will inform with the truth and let moms know the difficulties along with the benefits have support groups and peer counselors young moms that had difficulties with bf that overcame them and overall enjoy it we have to realize that not every woman is up to the challenge of breastfeeding as it is a challenge and understand and support them too all moms breastfeeding or not need some suport as some moms come to regret their choice not to breastfeed there are many more thing you can do but imo these are the most important  Breast Fertility awareness Theory of conduct Current teachings of Prem Rawat Milk Prostate cancer Scientology beliefs and practices Shaggy dog story Nestl__ boycott Goodness and value theory Ethics Breast milk Infantilism Folic acid Social rule One Tree Hill (TV series) Infant Omega-3 fatty acid Decision making Meaning of life EastEnders Coming of Age (TNG episode) Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Brassiere Incarnations of Immortality Cindy Sheehan Richard Feynman Humphrey Bogart Fathers' rights Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Scientific method GED Simone Weil Internet troll Utilitarianism Abortion in the United States Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Nipple piercing God Emperor of Dune Organic farming Microeconomics Strategic management Eddie Guerrero Breast cancer Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Justification (theology) Altruism Theodicy Autism Kurt Cobain Expert system Stuttering Ron and Fez Opus Dei Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Plame affair Deconstruction Pok__mon Live! 2000 Australian Grand Prix Terri Schiavo RuneScape quests Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder America's Next Top Model Past teachings of Prem Rawat Science Yoko Ono Divorce Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Same-sex marriage in Canada Consensus decision-making Kender Alcoholics Anonymous Avenue Q Determinism Kyle Broflovski Phoebe Buffay's songs Breast pump Jury trial Protein-energy malnutrition A Course In Miracles Abortion debate Martial art G__del's incompleteness theorem Time Out of Mind Kodocha Ayyavazhi mythology Appeal 2005 trial of Michael Jackson

what do i do if i cant sleep at night because i cant get comfortable i hate it why cant you sleep on your stomach finding a good sleeping position early in your pregnancy try to get into the habit of sleeping on your side lying on your side with your knees bent is likely to be the most comfortable position as your pregnancy progresses it also makes your heart's job easier because it keeps the baby's weight from applying pressure to the large vein called the inferior vena cava that carries blood back to the heart from your feet and legs some doctors specifically recommend that pregnant women sleep on the left side because your liver is on the right side of your abdomen lying on your left side helps keep the uterus off that large organ ask what your doctor recommends in most cases lying on either side should do the trick and help take some pressure off your back but don't drive yourself crazy worrying that you might roll over onto your back during the night shifting positions is a natural part of sleeping that you can't control most likely during the third trimester of your pregnancy your body won't shift into the back sleeping position anyway because it will be too uncomfortable if you do shift onto your back and the baby's weight presses on your inferior vena cava the discomfort will probably wake you up see what your doctor recommends about this he or she may suggest that you use a pillow to keep yourself propped up on one side try experimenting with pillows to discover a comfortable sleeping position some women find that it helps to place a pillow under their abdomen or between their legs also using a bunched up pillow or rolled up blanket at the small of your back may help to relieve some pressure in fact you'll find that there are many pregnancy pillows on the market if you're thinking about purchasing one talk with your doctor first about which one might work for you  Inferior vena cava Mattress Obstetrics Professional wrestling holds Childbirth Liver Urinary incontinence Breech birth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pregnancy Stomach cancer Abdomen Friends Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fetus Abortion Miscarriage Intravenous therapy Atrial septal defect Skateboarding trick Aerial (dance move) Recovery position Heart Kidney Prostate cancer Knots Landing Spina bifida Vein EastEnders Equine conformation Professional wrestling attacks Anal sex Chair Strap-on dildo Oral contraceptive Renal cell carcinoma Pulmonary embolism Hypertension Chest Deep vein thrombosis Fertility awareness Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Autonomic nervous system Spanking Sleeping Murder Sudden infant death syndrome Turner syndrome Professional wrestling aerial techniques History of anatomy in the 17th and 18th centuries Aorta Diabetic retinopathy Sexual intercourse Liver transplantation Varicocele Weight training Endometriosis Myocardial infarction Menstrual cup Jam (TV series) Kurt Cobain Insomnia Swingout Upholstery Menstrual cycle Androgen insensitivity syndrome Cirrhosis Suplex Masturbation Intact dilation and extraction Backstroke Days of our Lives Fight Club Birth weight Sleep apnea Humphrey Bogart Cancer Cowboy Horizontal bar Tocopherol Suicide methods Massage Abortion in the United States Prolactinoma Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Birth control One Tree Hill (TV series) First aid Heart valve

why does a rear facing child safety seat need to be positioned at a degree angle i consider myself well informed about child safety seats and their installation but i am curious as to why a rear facing seat needs to be at a degree angle i'm not disputing this i'm just curious what would happen if it was installed tightly but at a degree angle with the child lying flat on his back thanks a child safety seat should be installed at a degree angle actually closer to degrees is safer in an accident but if the baby's head flops forward when they sleep it can compromise oxygen supply in addition to just plain being uncomfortable if a child seat is reclined too far it increases the chances that in an accident their head will slide up higher than the seat back thus defeating the whole purpose of the infant seat they explain it better here http www carseat org technical tech update htm anglerf  Car safety Professional wrestling holds Sailing Motorcycle Knife Manual transmission Airbag Bicycle Recumbent bicycle Equine conformation Skateboarding trick Seat belt Car handling Helicopter Gas metal arc welding Crash test dummy Avalanche Drill bit Mattress Baby transport Space Shuttle program HyperText Transfer Protocol Wind turbine Chair Traumatic brain injury Automobile Strap-on dildo Japanese toilet School bus View camera XML Tank Poker jargon Air navigation Ford Crown Victoria John Stapp Drowning Airport Dale Earnhardt Internal ballistics Artillery Nuclear power Table saw Aerial (dance move) Seat belt legislation The Ark in Space Breastfeeding Automotive lighting Softball Microphone Naval architecture Diamond 2005 United States Grand Prix P-61 Black Widow Stroke Violin Backstroke Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Suplex OC-135B Open Skies Eddie Guerrero Fire Chernobyl accident Lung Gerrymandering Pole vault Sundial Messerschmitt Bf 109 Seismic retrofit Breaststroke Diving Elevator Autogyro Stereoscopy Golf club (equipment) Breech birth Sleep apnea Mercedes-Benz A-Class Ski Road traffic accident Slide rule Childbirth Glossary of ballet terms Swingout Infant Professional wrestling aerial techniques Glossary of American football Professional wrestling throws Dodge Neon F-104 Starfighter Dam Anatomical terms of location Sport rowing Daylight saving time Oral sex Shawn Michaels Microsoft Windows Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Glossary of climbing terms Mooney M20

what can i do for my sunburned month old daddy meant well when he took our fair skinned month old son out to the swap meet today while i stayed at home he bought him a hat and covered his legs but didn't realize that his arm was sticking out in the sun and he ended up with a sunburn it's not terrible just red no blisters it doesn't seem to be bothering him i am curious though if i might be able to put something on it he is still pretty young so i am not sure what is safe i am probably going to give him some tylenol in case it is painful has anyone had this experience that can advise me i plan to call my doctor tomorrow thank you by now i'm sure you've found something to ease babies pain what i suggest is don't use aloe unless you own a plant at home if you own a plant at home go ahead and use it warm the aloe in your hands before applying it is sticky and can sting a little so put on a long sleeved shirt and send him off to sleep with lots of extra fluids after the sunburn has calmed a little more i'd suggest pure olive oil and one capsule of vitamin e mix them together and apply liberally all over his arms and why not the rest of his body too little massage might distract him start with the legs and move up the olive oil and vitamin e will help repair his skin the best thing to do if you suspect it is stinging or burning is cool wash cloths once they warm up waves them in the air until they cool about seconds and reapply don't bath him for the next few days as warm water will really hurt keep the fluids moving like white water rapids if he is breastfeeding he will most likely find comply comfort at the breast and forget all about the burn love that drunk baby look anyways don't stress too much until it is bad sunburns happen  Psoriasis Breastfeeding Sunburn Aloe Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sunscreen Childbirth Swimming Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Massage Aerial (dance move) Humphrey Bogart Futurama (TV series - season 5) Hyperthermia Tattoo Comanche Vitamin D The Shining (film) Carpal tunnel syndrome Kodocha First aid Fecal incontinence Social rule 2000 Australian Grand Prix Hiking Eczema Marilyn Monroe Carbon dioxide Milton H.

convertible car seats vs infant car seats which is safer my son will be months old on the th of this month and our original plan was to have him in a convertible car seat in my car and have the infant seat with the base in my wife's car which we normally take on family outings since getting a new car weeks ago we have been taking my car on longer trips so we can prevent the kids from messing up the new car anytime soon my wife refuses to let the baby sit in the convertible seat and took it out and replaced it with an extra infant car seat base so that he can go in that in my car when i asked her about this she said it was because the convertible seat doesn't look as safe as the infant seat i do not want to choose the easiness of the convertible seat over the safety of the infant seat is one actually safer than the other i do understand that the convertible seat is made for rear facing babies lbs lbs but does the infant seat have any safety benefits i worked at a baby store i learned a lot on carseats from what i know theyre equally safe its just easier to use an infant one with a small baby most convertible carseats have cushions to help smaller babies fit in safely they're just as safe the benefit to using an infant one for a while is that if baby falls asleep in the car you can just take the whole carseat out take baby wherever your going in the convertible ones you have to undo it get baby out usually wakes a sleeping baby up i would go ahead and use the infant one for another month or just because its really more comfy for baby but if you want to try the convertible one go ahead theyre equally safe when installed right  Breastfeeding Car safety Baby transport Airbag Infant baptism EastEnders Sudden infant death syndrome M16 (rifle) Daylight saving time Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Motorcycle Paragliding Neighbours Nuclear power Tire Abortion debate Humphrey Bogart Infant Mazda RX-7 Toyota Prius Ford Thunderbird Baseball Mattress The Family from One End Street Bike lane debate Childbirth Seat belt Chevrolet Corvair Jam (TV series) Douglas DC-8 Mitsubishi 3000GT Ford Mustang Crash test dummy School bus Car handling Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Car body style Metroid (video game species) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an German car number plates Kimberly-Clark Corporation Sex assignment Blood Simple NASCAR The Contender (television series) Utility cycling London Congestion Charge Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Headlight Shaggy dog story Ocean's Twelve Walt Disney World Railroad DragonFly BSD Urinary incontinence Friends Seat belt legislation Personal rapid transit Airport Herpes simplex virus Knots Landing Bicycle Social rule Ben Johnson (athlete) Recumbent bicycle Station wagon Pregnancy Cruising (maritime) Rules of the road Bond Elevator 2000 Australian Grand Prix Infantilism Saab 900 2005 United States Grand Prix Road safety Passenger car Israeli Arab Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Doomsday argument Baby Blues Traffic light Ford Falcon Manual transmission Mountaineering Mini Wind turbine MTR Hollywood Squares Electrophysiology Bicycle helmet Car classification Rail terminology Chair Sport utility vehicle Rajput Charmed Beltway sniper attacks Toyota MR2 Segregated cycle facilities Azaria Chamberlain disappearance

why does my month old wake up screaming what's wrong he's been pretty clingy and whining a lot lately now he is waking up screaming and crying in the middle of the night what do you think it could be ok if it was only that he was waking up screaming then i would agree with the above posters night terrors and separation anxiety however you also said he has been clingy and whiny which seems to be uncharacteristic of him i would have to say teething even if he has already cut teeth check his gums for the first year molars my daughter started right about that time and it hasn't let up yet and she just turned she has stopped sleeping soundly through the night and has driven me crazy all day for about weeks and only the st on the top have cut through i can feel the ones on the bottom trying to bust up as well it is awful for us but imagine how bad they feel try a little tylenol and some teething tablets or orajel i hope this helps  Tooth Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Knots Landing Boston Public Poker jargon Sin City Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Contender (television series) Scream (film) Manual transmission Good Morning, Vietnam Kodocha Journey (band) World Series 2000 Australian Grand Prix Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Nirvana (band) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) EastEnders The Emancipation of Mimi Anxiety Negima Pok__mon Live!

pumping instead of actual breastfeeding i am not pregnant but my husband and i are beginning our efforts to try to get pregnant i figured i could also use this time for a little research i know that i will want to breastfeed at least in the beginning but i also know that sometimes it isn't as easy as it looks if i have a child and s he has trouble latching on do i just pump instead and bottle feed him her with the bottled breast milk for those of you who breast fed did you also supplement with formula thanks oh honey there's nothing wrong with pumping in fact i had the biggest trouble getting my daughter to latch on i ended up renting a medela pump and eventually buying one it was a life saver my daughter and i finally learned the appropriate way to latch but i still ended up pumping between feedings i had enough milk supply that i didn't need to supplement with formula i'm now on baby and he's weeks old i'm doing it again a pump is a great investment they can be a little pricey but so is formula your baby will be alot healthier thus saving on medical bills good luck  Breastfeeding Infant Breast pump Infant formula Fertility awareness Milk Breast milk International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Pregnancy Baby bottle Breast Nestl__ Nipple piercing Dairy Nestl__ boycott Days of our Lives Premature birth Sea-Monkey Humphrey Bogart Knots Landing Great Teacher Onizuka Industrial Revolution Veganism Abortion Protein-energy malnutrition Omega-3 fatty acid Childbirth Insulin Oily fish Patent medicine Phoebe Halliwell Folic acid Mastitis Prolactinoma One Life to Live Vitamin D Baby Blues Drawn Together Dairy farming Gross domestic product Heinkel He 100 Guinea pig Infantilism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Neighbours Married... with Children Prolactin Nipple Organic farming Inflation Brassiere FairTax Abortion in the United States Friends Yoko Ono Futurama (TV series - season 5) Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Lucille Ball The Price Is Right Metroid (video game species) Siphon Hydroponics Red Hot Chili Peppers Docosahexaenoic acid Boston Public Indianapolis 500 Medical analysis of circumcision Fiddler on the Roof Paintball John Edwards Puberty 24 Hours of Le Mans Cancer Cytomegalovirus Sesame Street Dynamic random access memory John Berryman Kodocha Conker's Bad Fur Day Marilyn Monroe Honeybee Billboard Hot 100 Another World (TV series) Piccolo Junior Saga Stuttering Abortion debate Situation comedy Platypus Pitaten Procrastination Jaundice Sam Walton Father Ted Public Eye Pulp Fiction Vitamin C Charmed Sly Cooper

is it normal for a week old baby's legs to quiver shake from time to time my son was full term and had a normal delivery we noticed after a few weeks that his legs would shake from time to time mostly when mad crying but occasionally when calm as well he otherwise is doing well and alert and tracking at weeks hi this is completely normal for babies to shake in their limbs especially as newborns because they are not as coordinated and have little control of them from personal research and experience of caring for my babies month old daughter and month old son i don't think they have much of a sensation to their limbs at newborn stages for example if i sit and tickle my daughters toes she gets real kick out of it and responds to my touch but my newborn does not because he has less feeling in his feet i have even watched him wake himself up or prevent himself from sleeping because his legs are bouncing all around and he doesn't realize it that is probably why they recommend swaddling methods at that age anyhow it is totally normal it would be different if he had tremors in his hands or something i would not worry about it a bit unless you notice him not developing as he should be and contrary to what the previous person said i would not mention it to the doctor unless you have a serious concern about it and see that it is interfering with his usual growth by the way when his legs shake and he isn't crying it usually is body language that means he is excited and also he could be over stimulated and just reacting to his surroundings in that case it is totally normal and both my children have done that  Childbirth Breastfeeding Hypoglycemia Prostate cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Urinary incontinence Out-of-body experience Androgen insensitivity syndrome EastEnders Shaggy dog story Pregnancy Puberty Clinical depression Child sexuality Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Milton H.

month old fighting sleep i have a month old who up until this point has had no problems going to sleep once he falls asleep at night he usually stays asleep for about or hours however during naptime during the day he will only sleep for minutes or so he also has a history of severe reflux he was in the hospital last week and they put him on some new meds but this has been going on for a few weeks now it doesn't matter if he's in his crib if you are rocking him if you are holding him he cries and fusses for over an hour every single time we've got him on a special hypoalergenic formula as well has anybody experienced this how did you get your babies to start calming down sooner hi my daughter was a very colicy infant and cried for the first months it was really rough for us because it didn't seem to matter what we did we couldn't even get sleep and both of us were taking turns and both still exhausted from sleep deprivation the best advice i can offer is to go through the routine what could it be questions hungry gassy wet sleepy fever etc it is just one of those things that you have to keep experimenting with to see what will work if rocking him and comforting him helps then do it try to give him what he wants because he cannot talk to you his only way of communicating is by crying i know it can be so mentally exhausting but just keep at it and see what helps i know you mentioned that he has reflux do you think it is possible that he could be burped too often i think it's good to burp at every feeding but i realized with my second child that the more i burp him the more he spits up he is known to have an occassional explosion of spitting up but only when he has been overfed or it doesn't seem to agree with him rarely also putting him in a sitting up position could be putting too much pressure on his tummy instead try reclining him or feeding him in a position that puts less pressure on his stomach because gravity can cause that if he isn't doing well with his hypoallergenic formula then try giving him the regular stuff soy can be great at preventing spitting up my daughter did well with it but my son drinks the regular milk based stuff because soy makes him constipated every child is different and it is just one of those things you have to keep trying to see what works best i am not sure about hypoallergenic and had no idea they really could make such a thing since most formulas have the same ingredients and mimic mother's milk compounds all babies spit up and all of them have gas if he is crying like that for an hour then he could be hungry maybe he is ready to start rice cereal and is feeling less satisfied solely on milk my daughter was that way and particularly fussy at that age when we started her on cereal it helped a little and she would at least take regular naps and sleep at night though she still cried a lot when she was awake another thing i thought to mention at this phase of development babies are starting to notice colors and moving objects more as well as learning to roll over and explore objects in front of them sometimes they get so excited because they want to touch something that is not in their reach or they want to be walked around the room frequently my daughter was this way and when she found her feet and ways to get from here to there she was a totally different baby if the fussing is only at naptime then i wouldn't worry about it it is just a phase and will pass after a few months try laying down beside him at naps or rock him and take naps with him in the recliner hang in there and it will get better  Urinary incontinence Sleep Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Childbirth The Amber Spyglass Shaggy dog story Characters in the Smurfs The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Narcolepsy About a Boy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Abortion debate Cat Philosophical skepticism Friends EastEnders Fertility awareness Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) Milton H.

can i give my months some water my baby is months and a half and i just give him breastmilk in the last days i started giving him some vegetables and i would skipe a bottle of breastmilk it is very dry in colorado these days and i was wondering if by skipping a bottle he is getting dehydrated and might need some water i will call his pediatrician on monday but until then i would like top hear from you mums thank you you should not be replacing breastmilk with regular food before six months breastfeeding should always precede regular food food at this point is just for practice and is only supplemental babies need nothing but breastmilk or formula before six months nurse give bottle before solids then top them off with the solids water is completely unnecessary because breastmilk serves all the needs of hydration and nutrition water in an infant too young can actually result in water intoxication and isn't needed  Breastfeeding Breast milk Infant formula Dehydration Nestl__ Nestl__ boycott Milk Infant Folic acid Fertility awareness Tocopherol International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Water Protein-energy malnutrition Baby bottle Alcohol Hamster Premature birth Fasting Childbirth Wine making Food preservation Jaundice Nutrition Sudden infant death syndrome Intravenous therapy Soy protein Alcoholic beverage Bowl Championship Series Terri Schiavo Dietary supplement Nipple piercing Coca-Cola Fancy rat Pregnancy Botulism Domestic rabbit Elephant Bong Sulfuric acid Gypsum Food and Drug Administration Dietary fiber Vitamin C Chinese calendar Kitchen Inedia Concrete Pet skunk Soybean Alcohol fuel Haloperidol Vegetarianism Social rule The dozens Dorama Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Magnesium Soy milk About a Boy Sea-Monkey Elimination communication Alkane Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hebrew calendar Backpacking (wilderness) Electrolyte Potassium Textile manufacturing Soft drink Ben Johnson (athlete) Gatorade Honey Peter Singer Veganism Ethylene glycol Mountain Gorilla Ammonia Bottled water Drink Low-carbohydrate diet Tofu MRE Atkins Nutritional Approach I Love Lucy Beer Food guide pyramid Garlic Vitamin D Fecal incontinence Quang Ninh Province Dieting Rotavirus Green Revolution El Ni__o Baptism Coeliac disease

booster seat my son is now months old and and weighs about or pounds i was curious when you put them in a booster seat dont worry i'm not trying to put him in one just wondering in order to move up to a booster seat they should be around lbs i believe what you are talking about is the 'convertible' seats that double as a harness seat and a booster seat in that case they should be lbs and year old although i switched mine earlier due to them being very tall and pushing the seat behind the carseat pushing it out of a safe position anyway those have harnesses for when they are little and then you can take out the harness and use it with a regular seat belt  Car safety Pound Strap-on dildo Baby transport Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Internal ballistics John Stapp Space Shuttle program Crash test dummy Galileo spacecraft Singlish Mercury 4 Harness racing Pneumatics MG42 Browning Model 1919 machine gun M16 (rifle) Ariane 5 Hobie cat Tractor Seat belt Scuba set Saturn V Dragon Booster M60 machine gun Boom Town (Doctor Who) Paragliding Airbag Personal flotation device Seat belt legislation Casualty lifting Transformers: Cybertron Swingout Owen Hart MegaMan Battle Network 5 Boeing X-43 Textile manufacturing Iditarod Piccolo Junior Saga Johnny 5 Richard Feynman Cruising (maritime) Travel trailer Mixed martial arts Page Falkenberg TGV Ben Johnson (athlete) Parachute World War I Steam engine RuneScape quests Great Pyramid of Giza Weight Mitsubishi 3000GT Equine conformation Mars probe program RuneScape Mini-Games Elevator Corran Horn Porsche 911 Space disaster S-75 Dvina 1957 World Series Booster Gold Elvis and Me STS-114 Nimzo-Indian Defence Handloading Switch Roller coaster Professional wrestling throws Mercury Atlas 6 STS-51-L Energy development Mid-Autumn Festival Wheel of Fortune B unit Shot put M-10003-6 Fire fighting Space shuttle main engine Space Race Milton H.

where can i find baby safe cleaning products i got a lot of information from thesimpledollar com look in the archives vinegar baking soda rubbing alcohol and non sudsy ammonia i've started using these a lot my favorite i buy rubbing acohol in the quart size from costco and instead of peeling off the safety cover i poke two small holes in the top across from each other so i can pour a small controlled stream every day i clean my kitchen and bath sinks by pouring a small amount down the sides sprinkle with a little baking soda pour a little more alcohol on a cloth or paper towel first i rub the alcohol on my cloth over the mirror and faucets and then i scrub the sink doesn't take lot of effort and then rinse might take me a total of to seconds they shine so nicely and are disinfected cleaning solutions there are a variety common household ingredients you can use to keep your house clean and fresh without stressing your budget because they are homemade products and made from natural ingredients they will not contain strong smelling perfumes and chemicals when you create your own cleaning mixtures you control the chemicals you use it is possible to use completely non toxic cleaning supplies however don t believe that just because it is homemade it is necessarily harmless ammonia can be purchased cheaply and is often featured in homemade cleaning recipes but it is not a product you can use carelessly bleach and isopropyl alcohol are also common household goods that are toxic while many of these homemade cleaning products are safer than those commercially available they may not work as well as the commercial products before you invest a lot of time and money in homemade cleaners experiment a little keep track of the time required to clean and balance that against your desires for a non toxic home it may also require more of a product to get the same kind of clean which could impact the cost savings in general making your own products will be less expensive but sometimes if you begin adding essential oils and other side ingredients you may find yourself spending the same amount as on commercial products non toxic ingredients baking soda is a very simple and effective surface cleaning it is similar to commercial powdered abrasive cleaners and has the added benefit of being an odor absorber baking soda can be used alone with water and sponge to scrub out tough stains like a scouring powder or it can be added to a solution to add extra deodorizing power you can leave baking soda on particularly tough stains even pots and pans for minutes before wiping away baking soda also works as a drain cleaner by adding up to a cup to the drain and adding a tiny bit of hot water let it stand for as long as overnight before flushing the drain with hot water it will not work on completely blocked drains but serves as a prevention method combine cup baking soda with tbsp cornstarch and a dry scent you favor to make an inexpensive carpet freshener borax sodium borate is a great all purpose cleaner and can be mixed with water baking soda or white vinegar borax works as laundry soap and can clean wallpaper painted walls and painted surfaces cornstarch works well as a window cleaner furniture polish and as a carpet cleaner and deodorizer this mixes with many things without toxic results white vinegar is another all purpose cleaner that most people already have in their homes when using vinegar for normal cleaning you will want to dilute vinegar in an equal part water but it can be used straight from the bottle on tough stains and mineral deposits vinegar is a deodorizer like baking soda and is also a disinfectant because it is colorless and contains no colorants it will not stain vinegar does not work well on marble or on grout and may damage it because of vinegar s acidity the vinegar smell will linger while wet but will quickly dissipate while drying vinegar is also an effective stain remover on sinks floors stovetops chrome and countertops and can be used to remove rings from your toilet bowl if you have family members with sensitive skin adding half a cup of vinegar to your rinse cycle will quickly break down laundry detergent and act as a natural fabric softener lemon juice another highly acidic liquid works extremely well on hard water stains and on built up soap scum you can mix lemon juice with vinegar and or baking soda to make a paste similar to soft scrub brand cleaning scrub or mix it with olive oil for a wood furniture polish lemon juice left to sit on a rust spot can completely erase the rust and hard water this may need to be repeated several times before the spot is completely gone salt can be used as an alternative scouring powder and also works as a rust remover when paired with lime juice club soda is a great stain lifter for fabrics and can double as a glass cleaner when using club soda as a stain lifter allow it to soak into the stain before blotting do not rub the stain or you risk smearing it around toilet bowl cleaner never buy store bought toilet bowl cleaner unless you have exceptionally hard water instead just sprinkle some baking soda all over the inside of the bowl add a little white vinegar leave it for a few minutes it ll foam a bit and such then scrub it down with a toilet brush and flush it no blue water either toxic ingredients isopropyl rubbing alcohol makes a brilliant window and glass cleaning cleaner this is of course not as safe as the previous cleaners it is also a powerful disinfectant for chrome and some kinds of ceramic tiles test it in an inconspicuous area first alcohol also works well for cleaning dirty or dusty candles ammonia is a very inexpensive cleaning agent but can be toxic so use with care ammonia is a strong alkaline and works in situations in which vinegar is not working do not ever mix ammonia with bleach as it creates an extremely toxic gas ammonia left to stand in the oven over night will loosen grime from the surfaces without the same chemical assault and cost commercial oven cleaners it may be necessary to follow up with some kind of abrasive such as baking soda or steel wool rinse with warm soapy water as you definitely do not want ammonia residue lingering in your oven chlorine bleach another potentially dangerous chemical is an inexpensive disinfectant mildew remover dilute cups of bleach in gallon of water to thoroughly clean and disinfect your shower or other areas that attract mold and mildew in the end the decision to use homemade products is an issue of personal preference if you stick to the non toxic ingredients you will be contributing to the health of the environment through not adding those chemicals to the ground water and air you will probably save money but the trade off may be a little more elbow grease to get your house clean

question about breastmilk i had to stop breastfeeding cuz i got a really bad infection and the anitbotics i was on wouldn't allow me to breastfeed so now that i am off of it my milk has dried up and i have been formula feeding well i heard that there was this pill that the doctors can give you to help bring in your milk again has anyone heard anything about this or know how to make my milk come back in thanks it is possible to relactate there are even some adoptive moms who are able to relactate without ever being pregnant or breastfeeding in the past there are a few ways to do this nipple stimulation via pumping and or latching baby on sends the message to your body to make milk usually you would use a supplimental feeding system that would let the baby get formula while latched to the breast you'd only use it until your full supply came back there are also herbs you can take to promote lactation and to increase your supply and there are also prescription drugs available as well i assume that is what you had heard about it would not be a easy as just taking a pill and starting back up but it is possible if you want to look into it i'd talk to your doctor and contact a lactation consultant the hospital or the local la lache league leader should be able to recommend one good luck no matter what you decide  Breast Fertility awareness Infant formula Nipple piercing Nipple Prolactin Infant Breast pump Breast milk Milk Folic acid Nestl__ boycott Protein-energy malnutrition Haloperidol Baby bottle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Psoriasis Urinary incontinence Guinea pig Oxytocin Veganism Mammary gland Jaundice Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Omega-3 fatty acid Dairy Patent medicine Brassiere Emergency contraception Medical cannabis Intravenous therapy Neighbours Nestl__ Prostate cancer Male lactation Abortion Doxepin Antidepressant Phoebe Halliwell Vitamin D Medical prescription Trazodone Platypus Indianapolis 500 Traditional Chinese medicine Coeliac disease Garlic Premature birth Boom Town (Doctor Who) Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Baldness treatments Malaria Cannabis (drug) Coffee Pharmaceutical company Chocolate Kodocha Caffeine The Caves of Androzani Nutrition HIV Rickets Knife Requiem for a Dream Illegal drug trade Medical analysis of circumcision RuneScape quests Penis enlargement Breast cancer Theory of conduct Methamphetamine Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Anabolic steroid Oily fish Elephant Orgasm Friends Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Conker's Bad Fur Day Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Sulfasalazine Breast fetishism Terri Schiavo Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Stomach cancer Physician Insomnia Sleeping Murder Allergy Jon Secada Hyperprolactinaemia Masturbation

are you suppose to get your period when you are breastfeeding it depends on the woman after birth a woman has a super period that lasts from to weeks you have to be careful not to become anemic during this time the is just the body's natural cleansing in action breast feeding helps the uterus return to normal by stimulating pitocin secretion and also helps the mother lose pregnancy weight by burning extra calories breastfeeding can suppress the menstrual period due to hormonal causes however women should not rely on breastfeeding as a method of birth control in my experience my periods did return during my third month of breast feeding but each woman is different  Breastfeeding Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Childbirth Urinary incontinence Puberty Endometriosis Obstetrics Oxytocin Breast Oral contraceptive Emergency contraception Prolactin Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Brassiere Abortion Premature birth Haloperidol Twin Protein-energy malnutrition Breast cancer Milk Ovulation Prolactinoma Cancer Miscarriage Dieting Menstrual cup Amenorrhoea Estrus cycle Breast milk Birth control Sexual differentiation Psoriasis Insulin Ovarian cancer Progesterone Guinea pig Jaundice Hypoglycemia Breast pump Polycystic ovary syndrome Hyperprolactinaemia Infant Acne Depo Provera Obesity In vitro fertilisation Endocrinology Breech birth Orgasm Anemia Prostate cancer Endometrial cancer Sexual intercourse Intrauterine device Folic acid Anorexia nervosa Niddah Intersexuality Sexual reproduction Tocopherol Mammary gland Human penis size Anabolic steroid Infertility Human height Clinical depression Medical analysis of circumcision Spina bifida Birth weight Cytomegalovirus Atkins Nutritional Approach Prenatal diagnosis Biology and sexual orientation Gender role Postpartum depression Infant formula Ovarian cyst Gonadotropin-releasing hormone Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Postnatal Hormone Hypertension Abortion debate Growth hormone treatment Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Cephalic disorder HIV Nutrition Vitamin D Strap-on dildo Glucocorticoid AIDS Neighbours Chlorpromazine Vagina

how can you tell if a newborn has an upset tummy my four week old is breastfed and we supplement with formula at night last night i nursed her for an hour then she ate more than oz of formula she was crying and rooting and refusing her paci so figured she was hungry overnight she grunted a lot more than usual and she didn't sleep very well til she filled her diaper yellow and seedy around am she then snacked a bit and she's been snacking all day not eally eating much at all and seemingly getting the sleep she didn't get last night lately she has been starving before bed and we can't seem to fill her up but last night made me wonder if either my milk or formula is giving her a belly ache i guess i can't tell by her cries she doesn't have a fever she might have had a little upset tummy because she needed to poop since she did that this morning she's now probably tired from last night and just needs to sleep she's growing and will go through cycles where she eats like a pig some days and snacks on others she may be wanting more to eat at night because she's starting to get ready to sleep through the night for you so needs a fuller belly if she seems content today just a little tired just let her be as long as she is eating some and going pee pee she should be fine sounds like her poop is normal for a newborn so i wouldn't worry too much if you've just recently started supplementing formula she could be reacting to that she could also be reacting to something you ate spicy food gassy foods remember if it makes you fart it will make her fart too good luck  Breastfeeding Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Guinea pig Pitaten Cat Infant Care Bears Toilet humour Ron and Fez Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Cuisine of the Philippines Elephant Flatulence The Contender (television series) Breakfast Insomnia Social rule Fecal incontinence EastEnders Childbirth Humphrey Bogart Garfield Comanche Urinary incontinence Indianapolis 500 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Super Milk-chan Show The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sleep Pok__mon Live!

what if your baby hates blankets and being swaddled my week old hates being swaddled and kicks off her blanket as soon as she's awake enough to realize it's on i bought a sleep sack which seems to be acceptable though she does work to kick her feet out is it possible she's just warm natured and doesn't require the extra covering she doesn't have a fever house temp is set at f and i'm cold natured i can't imagine the one layer more than what you need applying to her my son would not tolerate having his arms restrained from the moment he was born he also has always needed one less layer of clothing than everyone else your daughter may just not like having warm feet or she may be warm overall just touch the top of her head or the back of her neck and you will know if she is warm or cool lips work best to check temperature and you thought mommies kissed babies all the time for no reason seriously stop listening to the books the friends the relatives and listen to your baby they know what they need better than anyone else of course you can try other people's suggestions but if they don't work they don't work  Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story Garfield Global warming Diving suit Milton H.

transferring expressed breastmilk twice ok if i pump into medela bottles but decide to freeze that breastmilk can i safely transfer the milk to medela bags made for freezing freeze that milk then transfer the milk again to a bottle avent when i am ready to use it someone told me that sometimes stuff baby needs the fat gets stuck to the bottles and is left behind when you transfer it i'm wondering if pouring the milk from one place to another twice is not ideal i know i can pump right into the bags but i'm at a point with pumping where sometimes the output is less than an ounce and thus not worth wasting two bags and the storage space yet sometimes i can pump an ounce or more i just don't know until i do it i think the stuff only gets stuck if you freeze it in the orignal container defrost it and then refreeze it you are not supposed to re freeze it after its been defrosted just throw it away if it hasnt been frozen it can be transferred to a different contailner to be frozen  Breastfeeding Coffee Dairy Milk Ice cream Baby bottle Food preservation Futurama (TV series - season 4) Brewery Refrigerator Tea Plastic Breast pump Tofu Bong Autonomous building Futurama (TV series - season 1) Futurama (TV series - season 3) Bottle Philip J.

teaching baby to eat from a spoon i want to introduce a spoon so that my baby can eat things like yoghurt and soup she's never eaten from a spoon before how is best to go about introducing one she is nearly nine months old thankyou all you're right my baby has never eaten pureed anything or rice cereal and like i said never eaten from a spoon there are other ways she feeds herself and has done since day one and is now able to eat everything i eat where i live foods containing cow's milk can be introduced after six months but not cow's milk as a drink till after one year unless there is a family history of allergies which there isn't my daughter happily eats cheese sandwiches crackers with cream cheese or just big chunks of cheese so i don't think yoghurt will cause a problem thanks so far but i want to find a way of introducing the spoon without her wanting me to feed her at every meal any ideas you don't need the spoon mama steam vegetables in cubes and put them on her tray she can eat most everything with her little hands which is awesome for fine motor skills and she can also pick and choose what her body needs there is alot of research available online if you'd like to feed her yogurt just dip it in the jar and hand her the spoon she might play the drums or take a little lick you'll have to try and see  Dairy Yoghurt Milk McDonald's Tofu Korean cuisine Cheese Japanese cuisine Bengali cuisine Veganism Vegetarianism Food Cuisine of Denmark Breastfeeding Jewish cuisine Ice cream Cuisine of the Philippines Chinese cuisine Joke Vegetarian cuisine Mnemonic Cuisine of Laos French cuisine Soybean Cuisine of Malaysia MRE German cuisine Rice pudding Fecal incontinence Soup Livestock Persian cuisine D__ner kebab Chopsticks Coeliac disease Bread Sandwich Peruvian cuisine Cat Cha chaan teng Breakfast cereal Porridge Spoon Curry Mochi Idli Drink Happy Meal Cuisine of Greece Cuisine of Thailand Pea soup Elephant Peanut butter Meal Healthy eating Hot dog Kosher foods Salad Fingers Cuisine of Africa Kashrut Cuisine of Brazil Dairy cattle Polish cuisine Mayonnaise Dairy product Swedish cuisine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ramen Malwa Peanut Biscuit Hamster Taboo food and drink Culture of the Netherlands Russian cuisine Atkins Nutritional Approach Cuisine of Vietnam Cuisine of the Southern United States Oreo Mango Pizza Potato Maize Street food The dozens Basic English The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Halitosis Cuisine of Austria Comanche

milk formula hi right my and a half month old baby boy is a hungry baby and is not happy on the regular milk formulas so we put him on sma white hungry baby as we did for our first baby girl he then became conspipated so we kept giving water and still didnt work we was then advised by health visitor to change to one that worked so we tried cow and gate but it didnt fill him up and was always hungry has anyone had same problems and if yes then what milk worked for them as we are running out of ideas thanks hi i think he could be overfed babies this age have very tiny stomachs and have to be fed every hour or two i would give him or oz every two hours and see how he does it is too early to give cereal in my opinion but if you decide to then make sure it is thin in consistency because thick will make him constipated don't give too much water because all he needs is formula now also remember that crying does not mean that he is hungry necessarily he could be just crying because he wants to be held or for another reason experiment a little to see if it is something else my daughter was a very fussy baby those first few months and looking back i think i was overfeeding her i just thought if she was crying it meant she was hungry but later i realized that she just liked to be held constantly and cuddled and talked to she is still this way and at months she is still sleeping with us at night and our month old son prefers his own crib and to be left alone in his own room go figure they all have different needs and the best thing to do is experiment and see what works also another tip try letting your baby sleep in an elevated position in a carrier and see if it helps with the colic and makes him calmer but try to stick with feeding small amounts more frequently he may even sleep better my mother in law told me that if you give a fussy baby a few little spoons of vanilla ice cream it will help with colic it has worked for me before especially when i was at my wits end try that and see if it works  Breastfeeding Milk Phoebe Buffay's songs Joke Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Friends Shaggy dog story Infant formula Chocolate Fecal incontinence Kodocha Miss Saigon The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Coffee Paradox About a Boy Stomach cancer Infant The Catcher in the Rye Romulus and Remus The Amber Spyglass Jam (TV series) Sea-Monkey Nestl__ boycott Knots Landing Sleeping with the Enemy (Simpsons episode) Mattress Pitaten Characters in the Smurfs Poker jargon Garfield The Shining (film) Nestl__ Comanche Coeliac disease Childbirth Humphrey Bogart Salad Fingers Insomnia Hypoglycemia Vanilla Ninja Bread Theory of conduct Cliff Richard Sudden infant death syndrome Trailer Park Boys Milton H.

my week old son has his days and nights confused he started sleeping through the night at weeks old and the past nights hes wanted to stay up all night and nap a lot during the day how can i correct this i have a year old as well and i have got to get some sleep hi i understand your situation i have a month old terrible toddler and a month old i desperately need my zzz's anyhow i wish i could tell you to set a routine and everything will be fine but it doesn't always work with newborns i also wish i could say don't let him nap after a certain time or keep him awake but that also isn't realistic because he is little and doesn't understand i would suggest the method of tiring him out sit him up during waking hours and keep him busy this will also give your year old a task i do this with both of my kids i sit on the floor with my toddler daughter and tell her to bring the baby a specific toy we also sing and play hello and bye bye games for at least an hour i also make sure my newborn sits and listens to books and i even get him involved with noggin channel and stuff it keeps them both occupied i never stop him from sleeping though if he dozes off then i let it go but i am not going to tip toe around him and keep things quiet either if he wakes from loud sounds then that is because it is time to play and laugh also if he is not sleeping when we are ready for bed i put him in his nursery and set up some link a doo toys on his bed to keep him entertained i keep a dim light on for a while and then after an hour or so i turn it all off and tuck him in if he cries i offer him either a bottle or his binky but i do not advocate picking him up because that gives him the idea that he has to be entertained and he just seems to do a lot better when i don't mess with him a lot he does well at night but the only trouble i have had is that he likes to get up early in the morning sometimes and wants my attention but that is much better than sitting up all night try different things and see what works every baby is different and if it means moving his crib into your master bedroom just to get some sleep then do it don't feel guilty about it and just follow your instinct  Shaggy dog story EastEnders Dog training Time Out of Mind Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sleep Milton H.

how long should a wk old sleep when do they start staying awake all day they sleep a lot what you should find is that after to hours of being awake he or she will get cranky and show signs of sleepiness time for a nap to hours of awake time is about all they can handle in the beginning sometimes less look for signs of sleepiness fussiness rubbing their eyes etc by months or so they should be getting into a nap routine naps a day or so morning around am another around am and another around pm give or take by months or so they get into naps after about months they usually are transitioning to one nap a day check out healthy sleep habits happy child by marc weissbluth it's great for understanding a baby's sleep and getting your child onto a schedule here's more info from http www babycenter com refcap baby babysleep html newborns sleep a lot typically to hours a day during the first week and to hours a day by the time they're a month old but most babies don't stay asleep for more than two to four hours at a time day or night during the first few weeks of life the result lots of sleep for your baby and a very irregular and tiring schedule for you your job is to respond to your newborn's cues so you'll probably be up several times during the night to change feed and comfort him what's next at to weeks of age most babies begin to sleep for shorter periods during the day and longer periods at night though most continue to wake up to feed during the night they also have shorter periods of rem sleep and longer periods of deep non rem sleep somewhere between and months experts say most babies are capable of sleeping through the night they're not talking about eight hours though they generally mean a stretch of five or six hours some infants sleep for a long stretch at night as early as weeks but many babies don't reach that milestone until they're or months old and some continue to wake up at night into toddlerhood you can help your baby get there sooner if that's your goal by teaching him good sleep habits from the start how you can establish good sleep habits here are some tips for helping your baby settle down to sleep learn the signs that mean he's tired for the first six to eight weeks most babies aren't able to stay up much longer than two hours at a time if you wait longer than that to put your baby down he may be overtired and have trouble falling asleep watch your baby for signs that he's tired is he rubbing his eyes pulling on his ear or developing faint dark circles under his eyes if you spot these or any other signs of sleepiness try putting him down to sleep you'll soon develop a sixth sense about your baby's daily rhythms and patterns and you'll know instinctively when he's ready for a nap begin to teach him the difference between day and night some infants are night owls something you may have gotten a hint of during pregnancy and will be wide awake just when you want to hit the hay for the first few days you won't be able to do much about this but once your baby is about weeks old you can start teaching him to distinguish night from day when he's alert and awake during the day interact with him as much as you can keep the house and his room light and bright and don't worry about minimizing regular daytime noises like the phone tv or dishwasher if he tends to sleep through feedings wake him up at night don't play with him when he wakes up keep the lights and noise level low and don't spend too much time talking to him before long he should begin to figure out that nighttime is for sleeping consider starting a bedtime routine it's never too early to start trying to follow a bedtime routine it can be something as simple as getting your baby changed for bed singing a lullaby and giving him a kiss goodnight there's more on the site good luck and enjoy your baby  Cat Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Insomnia Out-of-body experience Childbirth Social rule Dream Siesta Shaggy dog story Fertility awareness Delayed sleep phase syndrome Milton H.

what are side effects of jaundice in newborn jaundice is the yellowish staining of the skin and the whites of the eyes that is caused by high levels in blood of the chemical bilirubin the color of the skin and sclerae vary depending on the level of bilirubin when the bilirubin level is mildly elevated they are yellowish when the bilirubin level is high they tend to be brown bilirubin comes from red blood cells when red blood cells get old they are destroyed hemoglobin the iron containing chemical in red blood cells that carries oxygen is released from the destroyed red blood cells after the iron it contains is removed the chemical that remains in the blood after the iron is removed becomes bilirubin jaundice occurs when there is too much bilirubin being produced for the liver to remove from the blood for example patients with hemolytic anemia have an abnormally rapid rate of destruction of their red blood cells that releases large amounts of bilirubin into the blood a defect in the liver that prevents bilirubin from being removed from the blood converted to bilirubin glucuronic acid conjugated or secreted in bile or blockage of the bile ducts that decreases the flow of bile and bilirubin from the liver into the intestines for example the bile ducts can be blocked by cancers gallstones or inflammation of the bile ducts the decreased conjugation secretion or flow of bile that can result in jaundice is referred to as cholestasis however cholestasis does not always result in jaundice jaundice or cholestasis by themselves causes few problems except in the newborn and jaundice in the newborn is different than most other types of jaundice as discussed later jaundice can turn the skin and sclerae yellow in addition stool can become light in color even clay colored because of the absence of bilirubin that normally gives stool its brown color the urine may turn dark or brownish in color this occurs when the bilirubin that is building up in the blood begins to be excreted from the body in the urine just as in feces the bilirubin turns the urine brown both my children had jaundice only my daughter requried she be on a bili blanket my son it was suggested i just expose him to as much natural sunlight as possible and it worked both were premature my daughter was a micropremature infant and her's was caused because her liver was to inmature to break down the blood cells my sons was caused by basically the same thing and it was expected due to the bruising caused during birth  Cholesterol Gallstone Insulin Folic acid Hepatitis Blood Cancer Pneumonia Primary sclerosing cholangitis Stomach cancer Carbon monoxide poisoning Hypoglycemia Diabetes mellitus Prostate cancer Hemolytic anemia Androgen insensitivity syndrome Psoriasis Bone marrow transplant Acne Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency Pulmonary alveolus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Colorectal cancer Cytomegalovirus Autoimmune diseases Thalassemia Bile Hereditary spherocytosis Nutrition Kidney Stroke Obstetrics Carbon dioxide Glycogen storage disease type I Tocopherol Protein-energy malnutrition Eye Cephalic disorder Diarrhea Cyanide DNA repair Urinary incontinence Wilson's disease Porphyria Lupus erythematosus Atherosclerosis Cholecystitis Breastfeeding Human skin color Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Alkaline phosphatase Vitamin C Radical (chemistry) Malaria Gilbert's syndrome Vitamin D Puberty Cystic fibrosis Schistosomiasis Biochemistry Herpes simplex virus Ozone depletion Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Chemotherapy Ultraviolet Lung cancer Chlorpromazine Digestion Tobacco smoking Gout Intracranial pressure Thyroid Diabetic ketoacidosis Foodborne illness Medical analysis of circumcision Intravenous therapy Chronic fatigue syndrome Asthma Iris (anatomy)

my son's fever my ten month old son suddenly came on with a fever thursday night around i was visiting my folks and i noticed he was hot i figured no big deal because he's hot natured when i got home i took his temp and it was at gave him ibuprofen and it when away well it's been like this for a day now i'd say hours fever goes away with fever reducer but comes back hours later when the medicine wears off so what do i do he's not lethargic he's not too cranky about as cranky as a baby can be with a fever he's sleeping well and eating a bit he's aslo drinking lots of clear fluids like gatorade and pedialite so he seems fine other than the fact that this fever wont leave he's not coughing or sneezing not even grabbing for his ear and it's not teething that's just a myth i'm just worried that there may be an underlying factor here that's causing this temperature to rise thus fighting off an infection i didn't take him to the doctor yesterday because they were closed and i don't want to take him to the er because it's not that big of an emergency unless his fever gets any higher with treatment i just don't know what's going on with him and would like some opinions on what i should do i was thinking a minor emergency center but then i'd have to not treat the fever so i don't bring him in without a fever because he was given medicine but then i don't want to not give him medicine just to show the doctor that he's feverish but i don't want to make him miserable ahhh i'm worrying too much help me please thanks his fever has been up and down since thursday night ranging from never higher and sometimes lower just thought i'd add that a fever is not a bad thing it just means your child's body is trying to fight off something there's a good chance he may need antibiotics to get better if a temp is his only problem and it doesn't get too high i would try to keep it down and get him to the doctor first thing monday here are ways to get the temp down that work for us take cold wet wash clothes and place behind the bend of the knees the creases of the arms and behind the neck we also let our small child run around bare footed on the cold tile of food lion and that brought down the fever yeah he will have dirty feet but it's worth it if you've been trying a long time to get it down and it's less traumatic for him  Common cold Urinary incontinence Hyperthermia Group A streptococcal infection Childbirth Breastfeeding Aerial (dance move) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chronic fatigue syndrome Equine conformation First aid Diving Characters in the Smurfs Pneumonia Malaria Rocky Mountain spotted fever Medicine Thermoregulation Social rule Psoriasis Gout Foodborne illness Fever Boom Town (Doctor Who) Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome The Shining (film) Herpes simplex virus Eczema Hay fever Diarrhea Domestic rabbit Drowning Humphrey Bogart Sauna Ron and Fez Piccolo Junior Saga Babe Ruth Knots Landing Ebola Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Fecal incontinence Comanche Customs and etiquette of Japan K' Temperature EastEnders Fancy rat Soap opera Lyme disease Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Carpal tunnel syndrome Little Britain Carburetor Hypoglycemia Theory of conduct Dialysis Infectious mononucleosis Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Climate of the United Kingdom Mesothelioma Vampire The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Kodocha Allergy Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Bubonic plague Fast bowling Thermal power station Pitaten Cephalic disorder Cliff Richard Guinea pig Fertility awareness Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Professional wrestling throws Insomnia Snake Time Out of Mind Charles Darwin's illness Intravenous therapy Health insurance Frankie Laine Dog

breastfeeding human rights so i was reading on the bbc that a woman was actually stopped by police in norfolk and asked not to breastfeed http news bbc co uk hi england norfolk stm do you think this is a matter for the european court of human rights surely a baby's basic right is to breastfeed even if other adults don't want to see it how can our society say that it's ok to not allow a woman to feed our babies in public but quite alright to have topless women in the sun on page and top shelf mags in the shops with offensive covers so who is going to be first and take this one to the top so that all women can have the absolute right to breastfeed anywhere well maybe not in dangerous places like high up on a construction site but everywhere safe and public please do how dare they this is why we need the same law in wales and england as they have in scotland where it is illegal to interfere with a breastfeeding mother in any way whatsoever i would have refused to stop breastfeeding told that policeman exactly where to go and would have liked to see how popular he made himself if he arrested a mother for feeding her hungry baby that would not wash with any judge i'd have sued the police for millions and had him sacked my baby son is fed when and where he needs it and if people don't like it them they can just look away as you said some silly bimbo can get her breasts out on page but a woman using them for the purpose for which they are intended gets harrassed bizarre  Breastfeeding Breast Brassiere Abortion debate Indecent exposure Infant Nudity Judicial review Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Childbirth Milk Gay rights European Convention on Human Rights Supreme court Intellectual property Theory of conduct Civil rights Bill O'Reilly (commentator) British monarchy Jon Secada Murder Jam (TV series) British National Party Scots law Child pornography Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Privacy George Michael Breast milk Infant formula Slander and libel Breast pump Vitamin D Sharon Tate Rod Stewart Michael Savage (commentator) Miranda warning Topfree equality Fred Phelps International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Public domain Phil Hendrie Rosa Parks Lawyer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fertility awareness 21 July 2005 London bombings Neighbours Ayyavazhi mythology Weathermen Knots Landing Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Freedom of speech James Bulger Blasphemy law in the United Kingdom Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 Guantanamo Bay Spyware SCO-Linux controversies E-mail spam Al-Aqsa Intifada North American Man/Boy Love Association Katelyn Faber First Amendment to the United States Constitution Independent school (UK) Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India EastEnders British national identity card GNU General Public License Unlawful combatant Stolen Generation Corporate personhood Fair Game (Scientology) Bail Human rights Scotland Appeal U.S. presidential election, 2000 Jaundice Past and present anarchist communities Mastitis Prisoner (TV series) Sheriff One Piece minor characters Terri Schiavo Jennifer Lopez Bill Maher Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Nick Berg Divorce Fathers' rights Censorship in Australia Fathers' rights movement in the UK The Young Ones (TV series) Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 Professional wrestling slang

how much would you pay a neighbor to watch your month old from pm to am she is sleeping throught the night and we live in an apartment building right next to each other i don't want to be cheap but i also do not have alot of money how much would you pay them it will be for a few nights a week when hubby and i both have to work i know that they are responsible for her and watching her just the same even though she is sleeping i was thinking every two weeks it may be up to nights a week though is this enough the fact that the child is sleeping during that time does mean that they are not being watched and cared for it appears to be about nine hours a few nights a week i think maybe to dollars weekly  Humphrey Bogart EastEnders Urinary incontinence Wal-Mart Public transport The Daily Show The Catcher in the Rye Saturday Night Live 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Knots Landing Avenue Q Big Brother UK series 6 Miss Saigon Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses Major League Baseball television contracts Friends Watch Sleeping Murder Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Matins World Championship Wrestling Day care Night (book) James Hanratty Dorama Billboard Hot 100 Television in the United States Blood Simple The Apprentice 2 Eminem Family Feud The 64,000 Dollar Question Eric Bischoff Unemployment Apollo 8 Total Nonstop Action Wrestling Marilyn Monroe Seinfeld Time Meat Loaf Television syndication Charles Dickens Walt Disney World College Program We Belong Together Mary Higgins Clark What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

do month olds really know what they want okay so this is really just to see what your opinions are many tell me that a month old can not possible know what they want i beg to differ my months old son cries when he wants fed his diaper changed or attention now the attention part is really funny for my son because on ocassion through out the day he will cry and cry and cry until we put him on his throne it''s the part between the cushions on the couch that are perfect for proping up babies so they don't go side to side as soon as we do this he's fine at other times he will not stop crying until his dad picks him up or at certain times of the day he wants me instead of his dad he also will cry until i walk him around or prop him up in my lap to look around i love it he is so much fun but when peole say that a baby doesn't know what they want i think that they confuse it with that the baby doesn't care well thats just a theory in the works right now my month old knows what he wants he's got different noises he makes for different things ive learned these noises so i usually know what he wants hes so funny he'll be in the bouncy seat sitting up with the rest of us adults watching tv we'll be talking if he feels left out he'll start fussing its like hes saying im here too dont forget about me lol and he likes to watch tv but when commercials come on he fusses as soon as the show starts again hes quiet its funny my son wants to be a big kid soooo bad already if hes fussing i'll hold him to where hes sitting up or put his feet down on my belly so he can stand up he immediatly stops fussing looks around he cant stand to be laying down if hes awake he wants to be doing stuff i think its funny how they seem to know what they want at such a young age how the parents just know what to do to make baby happy i know he cant be thinking im hungry i want to eat now but somehow he 'knows' does that make sense  Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Milton H.

month old son can't cope with solid food i'm worried about my baby he can't cope with anything other than sloppy puree and stage baby food anything with lumps in it makes him gag so much he will be sick i've tried offering him finger food and my own food and he doesn't know what to do with it it never goes anywhere near his mouth i've offered him baby biscuits slices of banana and apple cooked veg strips bread crusts cheerios etc he just plays with them if i show him what to do by putting them in his mouth he immediately gags violently until he is sick he's always been breastfed and doesn't even like bottles veyr much will only take a few sips of water from a bottle my health visitor is useless and keeps telling me to offer him adult food but he can't cope with it all the books say they should be starting to self feed from months do you think he's unusual what should i do my baby was month old when he started to take food i had been trying to give him food since six months and he just wasn't having any of it i think basically he was happy as he was on breastmilk and he wants to control the food now he can pick his own things up and put them in his mouth he will i have never got anything pureed into his mouth bought or cooked by my own fair hand i actually gave up for a few weeks tried again every day for a few weeks and then gave up again for at least a month we have him sit with us at meals and eventually he has started taking our food when we put bits to his mouth initially mince and bolognese sauce and now bits of veg fruit meat fish mashed potatoes etc how about crunchy biscuits like carrs 'table water' they only have wheat and oil in them and baby t loved them i also find that the vegetarian hot dogs that you can buy in the freezer dept of tesco and sainsbury's went down very well baby will try when ready but don't let anyone worry you about this my gp couldn't understand it and kept giving me lame advice but the health visitor has seen it all and she was not worried it's actually amazing how broad the range of 'normal' weaning is you will know if there is a problem with weight gain otherwise don't worry i know its hard on you though as you have to be around to breast feed all the time  Breastfeeding Cuisine of the Philippines Pizza Japanese cuisine Bread Tofu Hamburger Cuisine of Denmark MRE German cuisine Bengali cuisine Hot dog Peruvian cuisine British cuisine Fish and chips Veganism Cuisine of Brazil Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jewish cuisine Shaggy dog story Korean cuisine Cuisine of Singapore McDonald's French fries Food preservation Dim sum Soul food Breakfast Pie Cuisine of the Southern United States French cuisine Hamster Domesticated turkey Kodocha Cantonese cuisine Chinese cuisine Cuisine of Malaysia EastEnders Piccolo Junior Saga Salad Fingers Fasting Cuisine of Africa Coeliac disease Little Britain Dumpling Australian cuisine Dog training Roman eating and drinking Cajun cuisine Social rule Ice cream Ramen Fecal incontinence Food Alcoholic beverage Kashrut Organic food Sandwich Cuisine of Laos Comanche Knots Landing Cuisine of Argentina Childbirth Drawn Together Sauce Pizza Hut Culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Soup Russian cuisine Hot pot Jam (TV series) Prostate cancer Vitamin C Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler RuneScape skills Sant Thakar Singh Fancy rat Folic acid Polish cuisine Kitchen Hypoglycemia Japanese tea ceremony Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Marilyn Monroe Milk Book of Isaiah Meat Loaf Potato Tooth

infant sleeping arrangments my bed is a kind of loft it's from top of mattress to the floor this is because we have very limited space my husband and i live with my parents temporarily and our dog's crates are under the bed there is nowhere else for the dogs to sleep and i've wracked my brain even trying to mentally put them in the bathtub it's a queen size and i would not even close to be comfortable having an infant sleep on it it's barely big enough for just my husband and i the mattress is very soft we're high up and there are huge gaps between the bed and the wall the only thing i've been able to come up with is for me to sleep in my parents' den with the baby until we move out my husband is willing but neither of us is excited about me sleeping separately from him there is no mattress we have that will fit all three of us does anyone have any ideas of sleeping arrangements that don't involve giving my newborn his own room or involve me sleeping separately from my husband the dogs are in crates so they are safe but no they can't sleep in the den they aren't allowed in the rest of the house thanks for asking though i've thought of it myself because you must know we had to move to another city and didn't have a place to live for a few months we should be out soon i can't use a co sleeper because they don't go high enough unless you know of one that's even if the dogs were gone the baby wouldn't have any more room the bed is already in a corner even pushed up against the wall it's dangerous because of the type of mattress and the way it's built haha i also have a tiny house and a bed raised to to fit dog kennels underneath i moved the bed away from the wall ditched the comforter for thin blankets etc and co slept we sleep on a full size so you could manage  Mattress Sudden infant death syndrome Bed (furniture) EastEnders Kitchen Knots Landing Milton H.

in your opinion when do you feel its safe to take a newborn baby outside my baby is days old i am so happy but cautious even though he's my nd child what do you think taking your newborn outside is not a problem fresh air is wonderful for babies the real question is when is it safe to expose your baby to other people because of the baby's relatively immature immune system in british hospitals newborns are placed on verandas almost every day despite the weather to get them some fresh air you can take your baby outside for walks and to visit friends and relatives the real objective is to avoid exposing your baby to the possibility of infection the baby's immune system is not developed until to weeks of age the baby has an immune system with antibodies derived from the mother's placenta and from breast milk if mom is breast feeding it has cell mediated immunity the real defect of a baby's immune system is localization a baby's immune system cannot keep infections in one place instead they spread rapidly through the entire body for example an ear infection in a newborn can spread rapidly through the brain and nervous system a throat infection can spread rapidly to the lungs and kidneys therefore when a pediatrician is confronted with an infant younger than months with a fever indicating an infection that baby undergoes what is called a sepsis work up this includes a blood test a urine test and a spinal tap the baby would then be started on intravenous antibiotics so as to prevent the possibility of a severe infection from spreading rapidly throughout the baby's entire system obviously this is not something that parents or pediatricians want to do so the best thing to do is to avoid crowds and illness when you take your baby out if you must go shopping with the baby go early in the morning before the stores are very crowded if you take your baby to visit friends or relatives make sure they're free of illness even a cold can be dangerous to a newborn anyone who handles the baby should wash his or her hands in short avoid crowds and sick people another common dilemma is how much clothing you should put on a new baby a baby should be dressed the same way his or her mother is dressed a good rule of thumb the same amount of layers that the mother wears the baby should wear it's always better to be underdressed then overdressed a baby who is overdressed tends to get dehydrated get fevers more easily and eat less there is also a higher risk of sudden infant death syndrome among babies who are bundled beyond reason a baby who is underdressed really has no specific risks the other rule of thumb for dressing your infant wear what grandma says divided by four  Cancer Group A streptococcal infection Infant Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma AIDS Herpes simplex virus Premature birth Intravenous therapy Malaria Chronic fatigue syndrome Traumatic brain injury Bone marrow transplant Tuberculosis Obstetrics Escherichia coli O157:H7 HIV Urinary incontinence Psoriasis Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Lyme disease Vitamin C HIV test Milk Diabetes mellitus Foodborne illness Diarrhea Asthma Legionellosis Multiple sclerosis Prostate cancer Immunosuppressive drug Insulin Allergy Lupus erythematosus Sickle-cell disease Gonorrhoea Tocopherol Aspergillosis Androgen insensitivity syndrome Hyperthermia Stem cell Autoimmune diseases Poliomyelitis Chlorpromazine Jaundice Paracetamol Breast cancer Miscarriage Decompression sickness Toxoplasmosis Blood type Hepatitis Protein-energy malnutrition Hearing impairment Coeliac disease Schistosomiasis Rabies Menstrual cycle Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Hay fever Radiation poisoning Drowning Tattoo Newborn screening Immune system Glycogen storage disease type I Folic acid Chlamydophila pneumoniae Abortion Pregnancy Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Gastroenteritis Stroke Leukemia Sudden infant death syndrome Infant formula Vitamin D Influenza Anthrax Autism Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Lassa fever First aid Medical analysis of circumcision Dialysis

month old daughter with pubic hair we took our month old to her pediatrician yesterday and she noticed that her breasts were slightly enlarged she said it might be normal but if they get larger before her month appointment to come in for testing when i got home i started researching premature thelarche and found that infants with pubic hair are more likely to have tumors etc my daughter has fine peach fuzz that is very light in color in her pubic area she was pretty hairy when she was born preterm but it has all since fallen out the rest of her hair is brown should i be concerned about this fuzz and should i take her back to her doctor sooner appointment with pediatric endocrinologist or wait and see if the hair darkens breasts grow serious answers only if you're just going to tell me to go to the doctor dr kumar whatever then don't bother answering i want to hear from other people who've seen or heard of this before not people who have no idea what i'm talking about and she saw the doctor yesterday the doctor examined her with her diapers off she didn't notice it and that's why i'm asking if i'm just being paranoid about this slight peachy fuzz my ds has peach fuzz too if the dr examined her with her dipe off and didn't say anything it probably isn't anything to worry about but i'm also a firm believer in trusting your mommy instincts if you think something is wrong just call and ask if you can talk to the dr over the phone they should be able to put your mind at ease or tell you to come in again  Puberty Androgen insensitivity syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Delayed puberty Prostate cancer Breastfeeding Cancer Hair Milton H.

how bad is it to let my baby sleep on her tummy i know that letting a baby sleep on her tummy increases the risk of sids but it is the only way she will stay asleep any suggestions my baby is weeks old how old is your baby i know they say not to but if your baby has good control of their neck and it is easier my little girl had a brace on from to months which meant she had to lie the way i put her down i always put her on her back and she started night waking again as soon as the brace came off she would roll on to her tummy and wouldn't sleep any other way i was up all the time trying to flip her over then i would wake her up and it was hard tto settle her again in the end i just left her on tummy she was older than your little one tho as long as you have taken away all the other sids risk factors i suppose that is all you can do  Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Aerial (dance move) Mattress Sudden infant death syndrome Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Knots Landing Professional wrestling holds Narcolepsy Care Bears Dog training Girls Aloud Friends Equine conformation Childbirth Skateboarding trick Oh My Goddess!

is it true that too much air will cause a baby to be unable to breathe i've heard these stories that if you blow air into a baby's face it causes the baby to not be able to breathe it was told to me when i was feeding my daughter and i simulated a bomb whenever she would open her mouth and eat the food i would go boom and blow air in her face i wonder also is this why you shouldn't have too much air blowing on the baby when inside the car blowing in a baby's face causes them to hold their breath by reflex nothing else it want cause any harm  Breastfeeding Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Oral sex Boom Town (Doctor Who) Drowning Diving regulator Cat Blue Whale Fire fighting Sea-Monkey Urinary incontinence The Five Doctors Circular breathing Toilet humour Diving EastEnders Night (book) Salad Fingers Shaggy dog story The Amber Spyglass Full face diving mask Rais massacre Cetacea Characters of Lost Bong Conspiracy (TNG episode) The Legend of Zelda series races Hiccup The Blue Lagoon (1980 film) Elephant YuYu Hakusho Artificial respiration Aquatic ape hypothesis Egg (food) Scenes from a Memory Jon Secada Fire breathing Syphon Filter Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Inspector Gadget Rebreather Trumpet Flute Liquid breathing Richard Chase Tasmanian Devil Reflex action Darth Vader The Legend of Zelda series enemies Terrorism against Israel in 2003 Terri Schiavo Halitosis Alf Stewart Hyperthermia Adoption Kodocha Drawn Together Vegeta Infant Force powers Link (Legend of Zelda) Episodes of Lost (Season 2) The Curse of Fenric Traumatic brain injury Anemometer Tetrapod Colony in Space Dorothy L.

is this normal behavior for baby with a slight cold my son's has a runny nose since the rd his temp varies between and i called his pedi and they don't want to see him unless his temp rises to he eats very well but doesnt sleep very well since that night he'd wake up every hours or so will this go away when he's better hope it's not becoming a habit he's given infants tylenol and saline drops by docs instructions plus baby vick's vapor rub at night how can i make him more comfortable and how long does a baby's cold last on average he probably wakes up often because he is all stuffed up and is uncomfortable things you can do to help your baby be more comfortable are keeping his head up semi upright elevate the head of the bed if needed it helps them drain the mucus you can also use the car seat swing or bouncy seat use saline drops and suction baby's nose with a bulb aspirator use a humidifier or vaporizer near the bed this will help keep the secretions soft and moving hold your child in the bathroom and let the shower run to fill the bathroom with steam let he be in the steam for to minutes this will make the congestion drain i don't know about how long colds can last but i would say around weeks and over that i would definitely want the doctor to take a look at him hope he feels better  Mattress Nasal congestion Childbirth Fertility awareness Mucus Common cold Knots Landing Strap-on dildo Carburetor Insomnia Friends Sauna Equine conformation Milton H.

babywise gary ezzo i recently read babywise and have begun to implement the philosophy but now i am hearing some negative things about gary ezzo and his books so i'm just looking for some feedback to help me decide if i should continue if you used this method how long did you have to let your baby cry when you put them down for naps i have been mostly working on getting the daytime routine down which is turning into eat play eat sleep any thoughts thanks for those of you who find babywise dangerous what is dangerous the feeding schedule letting the baby cry i read babywise and implent a few of the strategies i would go with what works for you and your baby no matter what people say if babywise is working for you guys keep it up another book i liked was healthy sleep habits happy child by marc weissbluth but again i only use some of the strategies that make sense in our lives as far as crying my daughter almost always cries fusses for a bit before she goes to sleep even at months but only for a few minutes the most she ever cried before sleeping was minutes awful for me  Breastfeeding The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Knots Landing Avenue Q EastEnders Narcolepsy Urinary incontinence Soap opera Theory of conduct John the Baptist Socrates Friends Sudden infant death syndrome Polyphasic sleep One Life to Live Happiness Family Guy Phoebe Buffay's songs English grammar Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Jon Secada Shaggy dog story The Catcher in the Rye Spider Mary Wollstonecraft One (Voyager episode) Cat The Sims Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Azaria Chamberlain disappearance Sant Thakar Singh Marie Antoinette Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Anne Rice History of As the World Turns (2000-present) What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

blessed thistle hi my question is has any one ever used only blessed thistle without combining fenugreek the health food store was out of fenugreek and mothers milk tea so i started out with just blessed thistle i have allready seen a difference in my supply and i am pretty satisfied hours later i was going to order the fenugreek online and use both but i'm not sure if it is necessary every one i have spoken with used the herbs together and my doctor said i can take the herbs b anyone tells me to ask him lol i pumped and am putting my lil man to the breast everytime i can and seems to be working should i just stick with this for now the reason i wanted to up my supply is my son is a little behind for his age and he is not and will not be supplemented so plz don't suggest this i'd like to see him gain a bit more weight he is gaining a lil over a pound a month and that is fine but if he could gain a bit more i d be pleased thanks hi tasha yes blessed thistle can work on its own and some other ones to try if you want is red raspberry leaf tea and fennel tea you can take fenugreek and blessed thistle in capsules and make a big thermos of the other teas and drink throughout the day lots and lots of liquids will help too carrot juice is great because it has tons of nutrients in a glass and it well help boost your supply and your energy which i'm sure you need you don't have to use blessed thistle along with fenugreek if you can't find it but it might help even more also you have to consider that your supply may be just fine if your baby seems content and ends feedings on his own it could be that he only wants to gain a little over a pound a month my daughter is not a big eater either if on the other hand it seems like he wants more but you're not producing enough then you may need to up your supply and it seems like you're doing all the right things in order for that to happen you may try what i suggested in your last question pump after feedings and give him that milk when he seems to want more that 's how i got my baby to gain a little extra weight he seems to be fine though he's not in a danger zone so just keep nursing on demand let him stay at the breast for as long as he wants and be positive that everything will be okay good luck you seem to be a very good mommy he's a lucky boy  Breastfeeding Milk Fenugreek Tea Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Humphrey Bogart Bodybuilding Dairy Coffee Veganism Chocolate RuneScape quests Japanese tea ceremony Khatushyamji Dieting John the Baptist Sugar beet Hamster About a Boy Carburetor Curry EastEnders Money Ayyavazhi mythology Theory of conduct Solar power Breast milk Breakfast Hydrogen economy Folic acid Coeliac disease Terri Schiavo Yerba mate Ty Cobb Textile manufacturing Omega-3 fatty acid Rum Order of the Thistle RuneScape skills Frankie Laine I Want to Hold Your Hand Guinea pig Alcoholic beverage 2000 Australian Grand Prix Uranium Infant formula Little Britain Characters in the Smurfs Sugar Agriculture Tocopherol Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Lil Jon Joke Vitamin C Soft drink Rooibos The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Cuisine of Singapore Childbirth Herbal tea Kylie Minogue Ketchup Elephant Sage American Black Bear Prostate cancer Radio Yerevan Milton H.

anyone have a problem with their cat jumping in the babys crib etc i am mos pregnant and have male cat who is yr old so far he seems to obey well except lately he's been a little bad we moved to a new place that could be why stress etc so my question pertains to my concern about if he may somehow jump into the babys crib while she's sleeping and possibly suffocate her he already jumped from a box onto her changing table once and grabbed an item of hers in the middle of the night and i found it the next morning on the bathroom floor i don't want to put up a protective tent or shut her in her room so i'm hoping it won't be a problem st time mom and st time cat owner ahh pets can be very dangerous for little ones especially cats because they are known to be more needy the fact that the cat has already taken something of the babies and the baby is not even here yet is not a good sign my parents have a jack russel and when i was at there house for the first months after my daughter had been born we made sure he was never near her unsupervised and he was always locked up when nobody could watch him in at night he went to bed with my parents and they shut their door tight so he could not get out i would recomend having a friend our family member take the cat for a while or lock him in a certain room at night and when the baby is in their room and you cant watch the cat  Friends The Tracey Ullman Show shorts EastEnders Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) Characters of Lost Domestic rabbit Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Phoebe Buffay's songs Sudden infant death syndrome Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Inside Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Cat Knots Landing The Fairly OddParents The Star Wars Holiday Special Co-sleeping The Doctor Dances Trainspotting (novel) Professional wrestling match types Rose (Doctor Who) Pet skunk Housebreaking Bad Wolf Boom Town (Doctor Who) Hamster Fancy rat Lisa's First Word The Brady Bunch Guinea pig Kurt Cobain Fancy Crane The Death Gate Cycle Neighbours Garfield RuneScape quests My Family (television) Urinary incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Conker's Bad Fur Day Baby Blues Tupac Shakur Lorelai Gilmore Shen Gong Wu Richard Chase Jumpstart 3rd Grade Fruits Basket Humphrey Bogart Toilet Kakapo 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Ferret Blood Simple The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Night of the Creeps Sharon Tate What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

does daytime sleeping increase during a growth spurt my week old normally his norm slept about minutes at a time during his daytime naps usually took about a day today he has already taken a hr min nap and is currently over an hr a half right now very seldom has he slept longer than hrs during the night usually wakes times to feed q could a growth spurt be making him sleep longer during the day q will this disrupts what every kind of sleep he gets at night any advice is welcome first time mom am i doing something wrong for him to not be sleeping through the night at this point hi everything you are describing is totally normal for a newborn they are growing rapidly and require a lot of sleep especially in those first few months i noticed with both of my children as newborns that they would go for a few days and take really long naps and then it would seem to cycle off and they would be awake longer it wasn't a consistent thing and their sleep patterns fluctuated a lot especially the first months don't be concerned by it let him sleep as much as he wants i wouldn't worry about his sleep being disturbed at night he is growing and needs all that rest sometimes it is common for newborns to get days and nights mixed up but that is totally expected and you are a new mommy so i am sure that you are eager to comfort and spend as much time as possible with him if he wakes up in the night then try offering him a bottle or rocking him back to sleep if all else fails you can lay him down next to your bed in his bassinette some babies do not sleep through the night until they are up to a year old i am not trying to scare you my advice for that is to learn to sleep whenever your baby sleeps that is the only way to deal with a child that isn't a good sleeper but don't worry you will be fine  Sleep Narcolepsy Insomnia Breastfeeding Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knots Landing Siesta Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Social rule Humphrey Bogart Cephalic disorder Dream Childbirth Puberty Infantilism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Characters in the Smurfs Milton H.

cloth diapers are they worth all the fuss ive been looking up cloth diapers and seeing if they are worth getting and on eof the kinds say that you can only use them for days or maybe thats just the garuntee kushies i dont understand i know how to wash them and and put them on but what is the best kind to use like the ones with disposible liners or the mirofiber insert ones or what help please thank you angel l in my humble opinion there is only one choice in this matter that is cloth cloth cloth cloth the only real diaper is a cloth diaper cloth diapers are cheaper in the long run than disposables true there is a larger cost up front but each time you use those cloth diapers they become cheaper and cheaper until the are less than the disposables cloth diapers breathe where disposables won't even with wearing diaper covers over the cloth diapers they breathe better this means next to no diaper rashes you just need to make sure that you change them right away they are better for your baby's skin cloth diapers aren't that difficult to maintain under normal circumstances for one child you shouldn't have to do more than one or two loads of diapers a week that really isn't that much when you think about how much better off your baby will be in the long run not to mention your wallet cloth diapers when taken off your baby should have any waste dumped into the toilet and flushed away then they should be put in a diaper pail with water and white vinegar to cut down on the odor causing bacteria cloth diapers should be washed with a detergent just like your other laundry don't use the kind that says chemical free because they leave a residue in the diapers make sure you use a nd rinse cycle during the first rinse cycle put in a cup of white vinegar and let the nd cycle rinse it out cloth diapers should not be washed in bleach because bleach will break down the fibers in the diapers causing them to prematurely wear out and become nothing more than rags cloth diapers should not be washed or dryed with any kind of fabric softener because it leaves a coating on the fibers and makes them less absorbent cloth diapers can be dryed in the dryer but if you can hang them in the sun it is a natural bleach and helps get rid of stains and gives the diapers a very fresh clean fragrance i use a drying rack instead of a clothes line to dry mine that way i don't break my back reaching up to hang them up i don't drop clothes pins and i don't hang myself on the clothes line yes i say mine i'm incontinent and have to wear diapers due to a medical condition i wear cloth diapers all the time the only time i will wear disposables is on a long trip where it isn't easy to wash or store used cloth diapers give them a try i think you will like them today's cloth diapers are not your grandmother's diapers any more there are so many different styles of diapers and diaper covers that are just as easy to use as disposables by the way they will last for years if you take care of them properly good luck  Fecal incontinence Infantilism Textile manufacturing Urinary incontinence Dishwasher Menstrual cycle Plastic Washing machine Sewage treatment Upholstery Dry cleaning Procter & Gamble Hard water Dairy Vinegar Japanese tea ceremony Water purification Japanese toilet Clothing Poker jargon Soap Sento Nuclear fuel cycle Comanche Wound Mattress Jute Laundry Halitosis Tattoo Hand washing Hydrogen peroxide Leather Diving suit Floppy disk Tampon Water Sulfuric acid Domestic rabbit Brewery Sodium hypochlorite Hemp Bong Autonomous building Paragliding Car washing techniques Psoriasis Candidiasis Jennifer Lopez Genericized trademark Kimono Nuclear reactor Toilet humour Dishwashing Sauna Bedwetting Sterilization (microbiology) Toilet Hamster Casting Radioactive waste Wood carving Equine conformation Hygiene Breastfeeding Shroud of Turin Motor oil Internal ballistics Aztec Cheese Energy development Ultraviolet Microeconomics Thermal power station Fossil fuel power plant Theory of conduct Condom Professional wrestling match types Sanitary towel Hat The Dalek Invasion of Earth Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tooth Climbing equipment Spina bifida Wood Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an RISC

are my breasts more likely to permanently increase in size if i don't breastfeed my baby since i work with a lot of dangerous chemicals i've been warned against breastfeeding when i return to work after delivering i'm only months pregnant and my breasts have already increased enormously in size and have gotten to be cumbersome and uncomfortable will they stay this way if i don't breastfeed also will i at least be able to avoid sagging breasts if i don't breastfeed the truth is your breasts will become larger when you have a baby during your pregnancy your breasts become large because they are preparing for lactation your body doesn't know if you are going to breast feed or not but in the meantime it is still going to prepare for lactation sagging breasts are part of after pregnancy regardless if you breast feed or not it is a myth that breast feeding cause sagging breasts the truth is pregnancy causes saggy breasts true your breast will sag a little bit but the best way to get rid of them is through plastic surgery pregnancy does wonders to your body your body will never be the same after a pregnancy my sister in law refused to breast feed because she thought it will ruin her breasts well her boobs still got saggy anyways i went up a cup size and my boobs drooped a bit because they are bigger now and i did breast feed the stars look great after having a baby but do we really know what is going on after they have the baby  Breast Breastfeeding Brassiere Fertility awareness Prolactin Prolactinoma Breast fetishism Pregnancy Milk Breast implant Abortion Infant Breast reduction Breast pump Plastic surgery Nipple Infant formula EastEnders Folic acid Childbirth Breast cancer Haloperidol Nipple piercing Breast milk Baby bottle Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Breech birth Mastitis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Undergarment Mattress Pregnancy fetishism Menstrual cycle Abortion debate Mammary gland Days of our Lives Obstetrics Intravenous therapy In vitro fertilisation Vitamin D Human penis size Nestl__ boycott Oral contraceptive Cephalic disorder Equine conformation Body modification Dog Sharon Tate Omega-3 fatty acid Cancer Jaundice International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Progesterone Prenatal diagnosis Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society Caprice Bourret Dairy Ectopic pregnancy Guinea pig Coffee Theory of conduct One Life to Live Knots Landing Breast expansion fetish Social rule Recurring South Park characters Doxepin Puberty Birth weight Friends Prostate cancer Intersex surgery Tom Coburn Psoriasis Spider Urinary incontinence Childfree Oral sex Smallville (Season 4) Anne Boleyn Malaria Cytomegalovirus Everwood Pornographic movie Spina bifida Miscarriage Characters in the Smurfs Capercaillie Neighbours Seabird Dioxin Mosquito Marilyn Monroe Teenage pregnancy Elvis and Me Oxytocin Hamster Indecent exposure

what does it feel like when you have a c section done i was wondering what it feels like during the c section process what does a woman feel when half her body is numb doesn't that drive you crazy not having any feeling in the lower part of your body hi there sweetie i know that every woman is different and every childbirth experience is different but i will share with you what i have learned from giving birth to four babies via cesarean section i see by your answer that you already know that you are having an epidural great decision it is the very best way to go i can tell you one thing by the time you get to that point you are so ready for that baby to be born your are so ready to hold that baby and not be pregnant any more and so excited that the last thing in the world that you will be thinking about is that half your body is numb look at it this way if half your body was not numb you could not be awake to see your baby and you would not get to share in the birth of your child i can also tell you that the epidural is the worst part of the c section by that i mean that when the epidural is done the pain is done also i always loved it when the epidural was done because i knew that was the last bit of pain i would feel until i held my baby in my arms and the epidural does not hurt it is uncomfortable and it is an icky feeling but it is not awful or anything they have you curl up on your side as much as you can it is kind of hard with a beach ball in your stomach and then they scrub your lower back so hard with what feels like a brillo pad lol then you will feel a few little stings or pinches no biggy that is the local that numbs you so you don't really feel the needle that really numbs you then they do the epidural part you won't feel the initial poke of the needle because you are numb you will feel a weird pressure deep inside your back i hated it and that is about it i had of them and they were all different one i hated one i did not even know they did and the others were somewhere in between okay so now you are numb they tell you to turn back over on to your back you are so excited because your baby is coming everything starts happening very fast now and your husband or whoever comes in and holds your hand he sits in a chair beside your head and they construct a little tent like thing in front of you so that you cannot see a darned thing i always asked them to lower it so i could see my baby being born but that is of course up to you if you do chose to see your baby born let me tell you that they have you draped so well that you will not see anything but all the blue sheets draped everywhere then they are pulling your baby up and out you do not see any blood or icky stuff all you see is that gorgeous baby that you cannot wait to get your hands on they will wipe him or her off a bit and wrap her him in a blanket and hand him or her to you oh how does it feel it does not hurt nope no hurting you will feel some pushing and some pressure honestly just like if someone was pushing around on your tummy it does not hurt but it does feel strange while you are holding your baby they have to put everything back it only takes about five minutes to get to your baby but it can take up to an hour to put everything back together properly that time goes fast as you will be holding your baby and counting toes and all that important stuff that mothers do they actually let me nurse my babies while i was in the operating room but i suppose that depends on the hospital and how your baby is acting my boys were starving so they let me feed them that was an odd feeling because my breast was really numb it felt so funny but it was still wonderful at some point they will take the baby away they have to weight them and give them their bath and all that stuff i was still on this incredible emotional high crying and so happy and talking to my husband and all that finally you are ready to go back to your room they make you all clean and comfortable in my case they gave me one of the those devices that you press the button when you need a pain shot it is awesome the important thing to know here is to get your pain shot before you are in a lot of pain don't wait until you are really really hurting you need to anticipate your need for the pain meds and get them before you are in pain that way you stay ahead of the pain and you stay in control of it no matter how much it may hurt be sure to move as much as you can one of the exercises that we learned in the cesarean childbirth classes is where you turn your ankles in little circles around and around that is what you should do as soon as you have feeling in your feet important the pain wears off from the bottom up so you will feel your feet first then your lower legs you get the idea that is what i mean about the pain when feeling gets close to your thighs that is time to get pain medication important they will want you to turn from one side to the other in bed use your arms to move do not try to use your stomach muscles to do anything they may or may not tell you this a couple of times i had nurses that never said a word use your arms to move grab the side rails of the bed and pull your arms do not hurt and it will not hurt at all if you use your arms to pull yourself around i had the baby in the room with me from the very first night but that is of course up to you i did not trust them not to give him a bottle or something so i kept him with me when you nurse the baby at home and in the hospital make sure that you have one or two bed pillows underneath him to bring him to the right height you do not want to have to lean over to reach him it will give you a back ache also the pillows will protect your incision important breastfeeding is the single most important labor saving device that you can utilize it is wonderful you do not even have to get out of bed keep the baby with you and let her or him nurse as much as possible the more the baby nurses in those early days the more milk you will have it is wonderful you do not have to do anything you can sleep all night and all day if you want all you have to do is remember to change sides and to change diapers every once in awhile and you are all set seriously if you are new to breastfeeding it may be a good idea to keep a small night lite next to your bed and to sit up so that you can see what you are doing later you will not have to it is so much easier than messing with bottles i have done it both ways so i know this is turning into a novel so i will let you go if you have any more questions or if there is anything that i did not go over that you would like to know just write to me and i will be happy to write back you have so much to look forward to and i envy you do not be sad that you are having a c section i loved them i had incredible experiences and my husband and i were laughing and crying and so happy and so excited it was fantastic and unbelievable to me that i could have a baby with so little discomfort and so much fun i literally loved it i guess i know now why the super rich and celebrities choose to have c sections there are some big pluses write to me if you have any questions love and blessings lady trinity i don't know where carmen had her cesarean section but i really feel sorry for her i can actually truthfully say that my c sections were fun maybe it is because i had taken the classes and knew what to expect i remember asking my husband after the birth of my second son how soon we could have another baby i was so excited and happy i am sorry that she had such an awful experience but believe me it is not typical i feel sorry for her  Sin City Abortion debate Massage Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005

breastfeeding one month old my one month old baby will nurse and completly empty my breast and then a few moments later act like she is starving i know she is getting enough because she has plenty of wet and soiled diapers and she is gaining weight however it seems she is not getting satisfied i know she likes to suckle so i try to giver her a pacifier but she is not intrested has anyone had this experience i am drinking plenty of water and eating very healthy i also drink fenugreek tea to help with lacation last night i was up until am nursing around the clock and she would fall asleep then wake up a few moments later screaming i am taking her to the doctor next week just wanted to know if any moms out there had something similar and what did you do thanks this is my rd baby and i nursed my other two for about a year each it is funny how different they all are hi sarah boy your story brings back memories that was just like my little girl like some people mentioned keep her on the breast as long as she wants even if you think the breast is empty you'll always have a few more drops and eventually if she keeps sucking you 'll have another letdown another thing to check is to make sure she burps after feedings even if she falls asleep my baby took a long time to burp so i thought she didn't need to but she did keep her on your shoulder a few minutes maybe up to and when she burps put her back on your breasts to see if she wants a bit more then put her in bed that 'll also put her in deeper sleep so maybe she won't wake up after a few minutes other than that don't try to delay feedings and if she has enough wet diapers and is gaining enough weight don't give her formula either formula is a vicious cycle and it'll decrease your supply plus do you really want to start sterilizing bottles and boiling water if your baby doesn't really need it just nurse her as often as she wants if you don't mind try taking her to bed with you that way you can get some extra rest witch will help your supply and also being close to her will increase your supply too keep drinking lots of water and fenugreek but fenugreek capsules combined with blessed thistle capsules are more effective also raspberry leaf tea is an excellent one and it'll help your uterus shrink back to normal see what the doctor says and if she's gaining enough weight just relax and keep nursing babies at this age also have gas sometimes little aches and pains etc suckling and being close to mommy helps all of that so just be patient know you're doing the best thing for her and enjoy your little bundle of joy that as you know will grow up too quickly congratulations on your baby and on sticking to breastfeeding even though it's so hard sometimes feel free to contact me too i went through the exact same thing good luck  Urinary incontinence Fertility awareness Social rule Childbirth Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Infantilism Mattress Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Characters in the Smurfs EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Prostate cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Insomnia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Milton H.

how do you go about breastfeeding and doing formula together i am weeks pregnant i want to breastfeed my baby but not soley breastfeed i will be going back to work full time weeks after the baby is born i have inverted nipples and am worried i might have a hard time my mom was unable to breastfeed for that reason so my question is do i tell them at the hospital that i am going to nurse and they don't give the baby any formula at all or do i let them give the baby formula and then try to breastfeed i am just trying to figure this out this is my first baby and yes i will be taking a breastfeeding class but i have to wait until i am at least months to get into it thank you and please do not try to talk me into breastfeeding only that is not my i would try to exclusively breastfeed in the hospital if you can you want the baby to establish good nursing before you introduce the bottle the bottle is much easier for them and if there are any challenges with nursing it may be hard to go back to it however if the baby has blood sugar problems is losing too much weight or just seems to be starving it is ok to give them formula if that is what they need i would tell the nurses that it is your plan to breastfeed and they will support you with that but they will also be able to suggest if and when they think formula may be necessary if nursing goes great in the hospital i would try to wait about weeks before introducing a bottle but then definitely do it at least once per day so the baby doesn't refuse it when you have to leave them at weeks good luck and know that your baby will be just fine no matter how they get their nutrition  Infant Fertility awareness Nipple piercing Infant formula Brassiere Folic acid Nestl__ boycott Milk Breast Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Nestl__ Premature birth Social rule Stomach cancer Nipple Kodocha International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Oily fish Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Baby bottle Pitaten Urinary incontinence Nursing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Guinea pig Piccolo Junior Saga Melanie Wilkes Obstetrics Tocopherol Protein-energy malnutrition Mountain Dew Ben Johnson (athlete) Alcoholic beverage Professional wrestling holds The Contender (television series) IP (complexity) Terri Schiavo Knots Landing Ron and Fez Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Humphrey Bogart Dialysis Macbeth Certified Nursing Assistant Phoebe Halliwell Abortion in the United States Rod Stewart Alcoholism Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Great Teacher Onizuka Prolactin John Sheridan (Babylon 5) New Coke Jaundice Atkins Nutritional Approach Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Jon Secada Coeliac disease Soft drink Sharon Tate Marilyn Monroe The Family from One End Street Sami Brady Abortion debate Pet skunk Baby Blues History of corsets Infantilism Nurse Single certification The Amazing Race On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Bringing It All Back Home Friends Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Jennifer Lopez Neighbours Chris Amon Breast milk Days of our Lives Haloperidol Equine conformation The Super Milk-chan Show Royal Assent Clinical depression Prolactinoma Diseases of the honeybee Mastitis Pacifier Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 Logic Health insurance GED Elephant Charmed

my baby just turned months she's using a walker is this okay she has already begun to travel backwards im serious ive fallen pregnant again the tale is that the first will try to do things early to get out of the way for the next baby but anyway im just concerned that she will mess up her legs we dont have stairs im watching her every second i don't know why i thought walkers were illegal at least they are in canada because of the dangers associated with stairs etc got thumbs down the facts walkers do not help babies learn to walk and can actually lead to delays in child development placing a baby in a walker results in a significant risk for an injury thirty to per cent of infants who use walkers will have an injury falling down a flight of stairs in a walker is the chief problem in fact children in walkers face a greater risk for injury due to a fall downstairs compared to other children children have suffered serious head injuries and death as a result of baby walkers other injuries include fractures drownings and poisonings the mobility provided by the walker may give infants access to toxic household chemicals in canada there were thousands of walker related injuries per year in the s are walkers still sold in canada on april canada became the first country ever to ban the safe importation and advertisement of baby walkers http www hsc mb ca impact baby walkers htm  Diving Abortion Equine conformation Breastfeeding Hip fracture Drowning Days of our Lives Traumatic brain injury Abortion debate Asbestos Car safety Road safety Hiking Sudden infant death syndrome Stairway Malaria Tobacco smoking Breech birth Professional wrestling throws BASE jumping DDT Food and Drug Administration Neighbours Cephalic disorder Mercury (element) Pneumonia Bicycle helmet Domestic violence EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jessica Lynch Pregnancy Friends Hearing impairment Baby transport Murder Stroke Depleted uranium Folic acid Milk Premature birth Stem cell Paracetamol World Trade Center Urinary incontinence Cerebral palsy Shaggy dog story Autism Cancer Spanking Timecop Nuclear fallout Paroxetine 2000 Australian Grand Prix Arguments for and against drug prohibition Welding Androgen insensitivity syndrome Mental retardation Omega-3 fatty acid Cytomegalovirus Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Humphrey Bogart Decompression sickness Haloalkane Infantilism Adoption Crash test dummy Postpartum depression Abortion in Canada Virgin Mobile School bus Tutankhamun Paragliding Landing at Anzac Cove Hamster Ryanair Characters of Lost Gustavo Kuerten Murray Walker Land mine Foodborne illness Thimerosal Tocopherol Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an John F.

can i still do it i have a day old and i really wanted to strictly breast feed him the problem is after about days my nipples were so cracked and bloody that it was too painful to nurse him now he is eating out of bottles either formula or pumped breast milk however i would really like to go back to breastfeeding now that my nipples have healed is there a good way to try to transition my baby back to my breast the only real way is to slowly wean him back on theres a really good chance you will get the cracked nipples all over again so get some good lanolin cream to put on them just in case the best way to do it is just start putting him back on i have had to do this with a few of my kids i was partially weaning my daughter at around months when all of a sudden she didnt wnat the formula anymore so i had to just keep putting her back on and she would constantly drink every hour or two and hardly sleep but she wouldnt take the bottle after a day or two she was back on fully breastfeeding and i weaned her at months a similar thing happend with my now year old son when he was a about months old he went cold turkey on me and would not touch my breastmilk from my breast but would drink it from a bottle so i started to pump a few days later he decided he didnt want it that way anymore i couldnt get the bottle into him and he just wanted breast again it took a few days again to get him back on and those two days are tiring and i did get very sore nipples again but worth it if you want to breastfeed i breastfed him until months old being only days old you have an incredibly good chance of getting him on the breast it will just take a bit of time and peserverance and he will seem hungry but if you want to breastfeed you will have to stop the formula and just keep giving him the breast until your milk supply is back up again goodluck  Mastitis Infant Fertility awareness Nipple piercing Nipple Baby bottle Breast milk Childbirth Milk Breast pump Nestl__ Infant formula Prolactin Indianapolis 500 Knots Landing Hormone replacement therapy (trans) International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Massage Nestl__ boycott Protein-energy malnutrition Coffee Brassiere Lanolin Breast reduction Characters in the Smurfs Prolactinoma Soft drink Breast cancer Elephant Dairy Cat Vitamin D Equine conformation Social rule Apollo 8 Elimination communication Nudity Orgasm Urinary incontinence EastEnders Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Myocardial infarction Jaundice Hansel und Gretel Plastic Hera Guinea pig Mammary gland Kodocha Shaggy dog story Premature birth Kosher foods Jackass: The Movie Koala Marathon (sport) Co-sleeping Herpes simplex virus The Death Gate Cycle Janet Jackson The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Stomach cancer Puberty Harp Seal A Day in the Life Cuisine of the Philippines Obstetrics Shark Ice cream Dialysis Breakfast 2000 Australian Grand Prix Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Poker jargon Fecal incontinence Medical analysis of circumcision Bart chalkboard gags The Amber Spyglass Piccolo Junior Saga Out-of-body experience Supernumerary nipple Stroke Yoko Ono Cliff Richard Daredevil Breast reconstruction Red Hot Chili Peppers Little Britain Domestic goat Sudden infant death syndrome Cocaine Mouth ulcer B-47 Stratojet Leon White Erogenous zone

newborn sounds congested my day old son sounds very congested when he breathes like there is fluid or mucus build up somewhere in his respiratory pathways i know it's common for them to swallow amniotic fluid but i thought that would have cleared by now he has no fever and he passed his pediatrician's physical days ago but when he sneezes a white film comes out possibly from the formula and breast milk we are feeding him also he seems to choke quite often during bottle feedings is this normal or should i be concerned there could be a few things going on with the choking and feedings is the nipple hole too large remember that he is also breastfed and must draw on your nipple hard to get the milk out with a bottle nipple the milk comes out a lot faster without the draw our newborns all had congestion early on and a good deal of sneezing he is probably clearing himself out if he seems uncomfy use a syringe and suck the discharge out of his nose if a fever take him to the doctor and have him looked at you should stick to breastfeeding only to get your supply built up as well as the fact that it is easier to digest good luck to you and congrats on your new baby  Breastfeeding Infant Elephant Childbirth Nipple Fertility awareness Pneumonia Breast milk Nipple piercing Milk Jaundice Infant formula Common cold Baby bottle Prolactin Toilet humour Reptile Intravenous therapy Bong Guinea pig Cat Carburetor Oxytocin Cystic fibrosis Nasal congestion Mastitis Group A streptococcal infection Obstetrics Urinary incontinence HIV Hay fever Vampire Hypoglycemia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Vitamin D Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Happy Tree Friends Breast pump Respiratory rate Mosquito International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Abortion Pulmonary alveolus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Transmission (medicine) Infant respiratory distress syndrome Pacifier Amniotic sac Siphon Protein-energy malnutrition Nose Piccolo Junior Saga Kangaroo Drawn Together Breast reduction Tasmanian Devil Pasteurization Blood (computer game) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Brassiere Domestic rabbit Diphtheria Russian joke Medical analysis of circumcision 2000 Australian Grand Prix Flatulence Nestl__ Internal ballistics Teat Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Whale Nestl__ boycott Mammary gland Cytomegalovirus Insomnia Stomach cancer Rocky Mountain spotted fever Noonan syndrome House Mouse Gong Social rule Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Nudity Decompression sickness Prolactinoma Hyperthermia Glycogen storage disease type I Kyoryuu Sentai ZyuRanger Dairy Fancy rat Intact dilation and extraction Shotgun Patent medicine Fecal incontinence Patent ductus arteriosus Trapping

my nephew and i are very close how do i assure him that if i have a baby i won't love him any less when my sister nephew's mother told him that my husband and i were probably going to have a baby soon he said but insert my name here thinks that i'm her baby he seemed really down for the rest of that night and when i bring it up he doesn't hardly respond i want to let him know that i will always love him very much even if i do have children of my own what is the best way to do this this is a delicate situation we all know what you wanted to here from him is wow that's great but children don't think like adults always and what your nephew is most likely thinking is that he'll be second best to your child but encourage that the new baby will be like a younger brother or sister to him ask if he wants to come with when your shopping for new baby things and have him pick out a few things but no matter how many times you tell him that the baby won't tear you apart that's probably not what he's thinking it's still not good enough if he's a good five years older then your baby then maybe tell him that once he and the baby are older that he might be able to babysit the most important thing to do is to not slack off on the fun things you guys did together make sure your nephew knows that it'll all be the same you'll still play catch at the park and you'll still read to him communicate that it's all the same good luck  EastEnders Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knots Landing Stewie Griffin Humphrey Bogart The Adventures of Pete & Pete Jon Secada The Fairly OddParents Everwood Phoebe Halliwell Pitaten Melanie Wilkes Charmed Transactional analysis Baby Blues The McGuire Sisters Boy Meets World The Family from One End Street History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Paige Matthews Kodocha The Ashlee Simpson Show Infantilism The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Night (book) Phoebe Buffay's songs House of Bourbon Origin belief Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Rod Stewart Social rule Married... with Children Ayyavazhi mythology Sharon Tate The Lovely Bones Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Time Out of Mind About a Boy Honey and Clover Haven (TNG episode) Rais massacre The Catcher in the Rye Trailer Park Boys Shaggy dog story Luke and Laura Spencer Incest Romulus and Remus FoxTrot Abortion debate Characters in the Smurfs Katharine Hepburn Past characters (Neighbours) The Magician's Nephew John the Baptist Whitney Houston Neighbours Brian Close Scrooge McDuck Family Doug One Life to Live Rugrats Henry VIII of England Macbeth Characters of Lost The Chronicles of Narnia The Critic Jam (TV series) Aladdin (1992 film) What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

drugs and intervention in childbirth why are people so naive when it comes to this issue i know that doctors don't instill much faith in a womans natural ability to give birth because it isn't convenient for them don't people realise that for every type of drug intervention can lead to further complications e g with an epidural you have to lay on your back which often leads to slow progression of labour fetal distress nasty tears etc i know that some want to avoid the pain with medication but i think that a lot of people underestimate the effect that it can have on the baby and the labour i was not implying that opting for meds is weak i was simply saying why don't women educate themselves and take active roles in the decisions etc there is a place for intervention i agree yes i have had beautiful of course drug free labours i'm not claiming to be superwoman i just let my body do it's job i guess you were lucky that nothing went wrong mercy i totally agree that women under estimate their ability to tolerate pain all the women i talked with prior to making my decision to get the epidural told me you can't not get it the pain is unbearable they scacred me into getting it the intervention for me was the epidural it prolonged labor once i got the epidural my labor almost cam to a complete hault and i had to be put on iv pitocin to keep things moving along one thing just leads to another my labor was so long that the epidural wore off long before labor was over and once your drip is out that is it they don't refill it i did the most intense part of labor without any assistance from pain meds even though my daughter was completely healthy i feel things could have gone better if i hadn't gotten the epidural and had to lay in bed moving around is te key this pregnancy i am going natural i am going to use water to help with relaxation and pregression i know i can do the worst part on my own so i will be able to go though the entire labor drug free  Epidural Caesarean section Abortion debate Theory of conduct Local anesthesia Breastfeeding Breech birth Abortion Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Herpes simplex virus Premature birth Medicine Miscarriage Folic acid Cancer EastEnders Social rule Trade union Traumatic brain injury Friends Chronic fatigue syndrome Paracetamol Drug addiction Anxiety Opioid Goodness and value theory Prostate cancer Menstrual cycle Simone Weil Psoriasis Microeconomics Theodicy Libertarianism In vitro fertilisation Midwifery Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Milton H.

my baby is month old and i am breastfeed her my question is how will my breast look like after well actually it depends on a lot of stuff like how long you plan to nurse her your type of skin your figure etc i personally think that the longer you breastfeed the more adverse effects it may have on the shape of your breasts your type of skin and muscles are very important in being able to help you get your breasts back in shape if you have loose muscles or do not excercise enough well it's hard for them to get back in shape if you have a coordinated figure that is you have fat distributed evenly throughout your body or if you have a bigger bust than abdomen legs you are more likely to get back in shape i breastfed my daughter for years and really got into horrible shape because i had loose muscles and an uncoordinated figure i e thinner bust than abdomen but don't worry we have a miracle called plastic surgery and it's really a good thing i've done my share of research and i think implants are quite safe if you don't plan to breastfeed any more  Breastfeeding Breast Breast implant Prostate cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Breast cancer Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Childbirth Stomach cancer Plastic surgery Equine conformation Androgen insensitivity syndrome Fertility awareness History of corsets Breast reduction Swimming Cancer Radiation therapy Tocopherol Breast reconstruction Nipple Medicine Stuttering Undergarment Tightlacing Local anesthesia Traumatic brain injury Vitamin D Spina bifida Abdomen Nipple piercing Protein Skin Soft tissue sarcoma Strap-on dildo Weight training Fecal incontinence Secondary sex characteristic Baldness treatments Body modification Terminal ballistics Mattress Cerebellum Aikido Jaundice EastEnders Emergency contraception Insulin Infant Epilepsy Protein-energy malnutrition Morphogenesis Dog Infant formula Lymphatic system Psoriasis Physical attractiveness Stroke Breast fetishism Muscle Pneumonia Hand grenade Folic acid Obesity Charles Darwin's illness Sexual differentiation Ultimates Head Orgasm Drill bit Naruto jutsu Prolactinoma Gastroparesis Indecent exposure Diving suit Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cruising (maritime) Sin City Nestl__ boycott Sperm Whale Acupuncture Tutankhamun Stem cell Dialysis Cephalic disorder Adjustable gastric band Bodybuilding Multiple sclerosis Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Animal testing Aerial (dance move) Tai Chi Chuan

ignorant to the facts why are people still ignorant to the benefits of breastfeeding and if not so then why do many people choose second best it seems that formula is the normal these days but shouldn't it be the other way around i am here to bash no one besides it is ok to feel guilty about a poor decision we do all the time whether it has to do with breastfeeding or not so get over it and just do your best there are lots of ways to excel in motherhood and i don't care about stories where a mother had to use formula this is not about that it is about people who chose to substitute themselves just because they felt like it i am asking questions to find answers to things i do not understand no judging here honestly everybody i know uses formula and i don't think less of them but i do see their children have serious health problems often and i just think that it would be beneficial to all if our children were healthier and as we all know breast milk is just perfect for babies that's all when you look at how long it was considered unacceptable or at least unusual to breastfeed it's really no wonder that so many women still chooose to use formula even though society is much more accepting of breastfeeding if you never saw any woman breastfeeding their baby but only bottles you might grow up thinking that's the way it's suppose to be it's great that you see advertising to promote breastfeeding as opposed to all the ads for formula and bottles and whatever else you need if you're going that route but that is all fairly recently mostly it is ignorance i think because if a woman truly knows the difference between giving their baby breastmilk vs formula it would be a hard sell for a mother to choose formula a lot of woman make a choice before they have kids before birth or just days into it that breastfeeding isnt for them because they think it's 'weird' to put their baby's mouth to their breast because they're worried about their sex lif or changes to their body because they're working or otherwise afraid of the time commitment because they've been told that formula is just as good or only slightly less than breastmilk and all their baby needs when you look at who does breastfeed their children it's typically more educated women that's why there have been older studies showing that breastmilk boosts iq levels when comparing formula fed babies to breastfed ones they found children who had been breastfed had higher iq levels recent studies are showing that isnt a direct result from the breastmilk though it's genetics environment i breastfed my daughter for mths but i didnt find it easy between poor dr advice relating to breastfeeding family finding it 'strange' to breastfeed family that originally supported my decision constantly questioning when i was going to stop once she passed mths it was all pretty draining the best decision but if only society made it easier to make the right choice  Fertility awareness Abortion debate Theory of conduct Childbirth Sexual orientation Milk Breast milk Androgen insensitivity syndrome Infant formula Prostate cancer Nestl__ boycott Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Social rule Infant Transsexuality Jaundice Divorce Medical analysis of circumcision Cancer Veganism Anorexia nervosa Microeconomics Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder The Apprentice 2 Abortion in the United States Stuttering Intelligence quotient Economic inequality Biology and sexual orientation Socrates Unemployment Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Folic acid Vitamin D Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Adoption Haloperidol Economics Autism EastEnders Stomach cancer Capitalism Sant Thakar Singh Puberty About a Boy Asperger syndrome Voter turnout Arguments for and against drug prohibition Brassiere Same-sex marriage Transactional analysis Current teachings of Prem Rawat Prenatal diagnosis Organic farming Urinary incontinence Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Left-handed Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Breast cancer Ethics Sex education Joke Pregnancy Mental retardation Democracy Cytomegalovirus Justification (theology) Baby bottle Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Shaggy dog story Free will Inflation Protein-energy malnutrition Altruism Tocopherol Kylie Minogue Alexander Technique Health insurance Hearing impairment Simone Weil AIDS Polyamory Redundant array of independent disks ELO rating system Yoko Ono 613 mitzvot Politics of Canada Singlish

my month old daughter is breastfeeding every hours or less during the night what can i do to get some more sleep i was thinking that maybe my milk is not enough for her i tried to give her a bottle with formula milk with a plasmon buisciut for infants but she slept only for hours and a half before she woke up for another feed any suggestions i am with her all day as i am not currently working and during the day she feeds every hours i dont think its a growth spurt as this has been going on for more than a week now she might be having a growth spurt how often do you feed her during the day is she eating every couple hours as well if she's eating around the clock that's usually the sign of a growth spurt where she nurses more to increase your milk supply she will go back to a more reasonable pattern soon are you away from her during the day she might also be a reverse cycler where since she's not getting enough time with you during the day she nurses more at night to encourage her to sleep through the night make sure she's eating every hours during the day have a consistent bedtime routine ex a bath a lotion massage a song and place her to sleep when she's drowsy at her age she's way more aware of her world if you put her to sleep by nursing and then put her down she'll wake up and still expect to be nursing think about waking up and your pillow isn't there it's disorientating you can diagnose this because she'll wake up in multiples of minutes from the time she fell asleep i recommend the ferber book how to solve your child's sleep problem because it gives you the science behind sleeping if you understand why she's waking up you'll have a better plan for getting her to sleep edit ok it's definitely that she's more aware of her surroundings and is waking up because the circumstances of when she went to sleep aren't the same it's the not the breastfeeding it's the sleep training i highly recommend the ferber book i'm linking some info below that gives an outline you don't have to follow his plan exactly but he gives you some good coping tips  Breastfeeding Sleep Fertility awareness Narcolepsy Childbirth Urinary incontinence Milk Insomnia Infant Hypoglycemia Cat Daylight saving time Infant formula Breast First aid The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Dream Puberty Folic acid Dairy Co-sleeping Clinical depression Sudden infant death syndrome Social rule Apollo 8 Sleep disorder Terri Schiavo Delayed sleep phase syndrome Siesta Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fecal incontinence Diazepam Combat stress reaction Meditation Guinea pig Light pollution Massage Protein-energy malnutrition Traumatic brain injury Autism Breast cancer Prostate cancer Hypnosis The Time Machine Time A Day in the Life Cancer Industrial Revolution Whale Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Knots Landing Nipple piercing Chronic fatigue syndrome Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Rule of St Benedict Breast milk Shaggy dog story Mathematician Odyssey Glycogen storage disease type I Tooth Nestl__ boycott Kurt Cobain Human height Bottlenose Dolphin Cannabis (drug) Sleeping Murder Hera Stroke Garfield Dialysis Abortion Bedwetting Child sexuality Atkins Nutritional Approach Saturday Night Live Hansel und Gretel The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie John the Baptist Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Amber Spyglass International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Avenue Q The Catcher in the Rye A Course In Miracles Sigmund Freud Hormone replacement therapy (trans)

autism and breastmilk has there been any research done to show how many autistic children were breastfed i am beginning to think there is a link most autistic children that i see have older slim mothers that breastfeed could there be something the mother is doing not doing to unintentionally cause their child to be autistic i see some mothers worrying about their bodies after the pregnancy could the infant not be getting enough fat in their diet which is very important for brain development i formula fed both my children and i have not had any problems with chronic illnesses or mental dysfunction has anyone seen any research i doubt there's a link to breastfeeding or the mother's age causing autism i have kids and they all were breastfed my youngest was born when i was no autism one of my nephew's on the other hand was bottle fed and born to a young mother around or so and he's autistic i believe the rise in autism is due to the fact that not all mental deficiencies are being lumped into one category any more autism is being recognized in it's own separate category with it's own unique symptoms so we can now clearly see that there's a difference between a child with autism and say a child with down syndrome edit both parents of my nephew with autism were young and she has a second son who is not autistic  Breastfeeding Controversies in autism Autism epidemic Asperger syndrome Autistic spectrum Autistic community Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders Bernard Rimland Hypoglycemia Andrew Wakefield Autistic enterocolitis Nutrition Thimerosal Pervasive developmental disorder Cephalic disorder MMR vaccine Ethical challenges to autism treatment Infant formula Haloperidol Autistic culture Facilitated communication Protein-energy malnutrition Simon Baron-Cohen Intelligence quotient Brain Childbirth Fertility awareness Glycogen storage disease type I Refrigerator mother Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Gluten-free, casein-free diet Mental illness HIV Anti-psychiatry Gifted Diabetes mellitus Folic acid Lesch-Nyhan syndrome M.I.N.D.

does using a pump really gurantee more breastmilk so i bought this pump today single and manual this is the first time i will pump since weeks ago when my baby was born for the breastfeeding moms out there could you explain to me for how long should i pump any other tips will be much appreciated oops i meant ''guarantee'' if you're trying to improve your milk production you should pump before and or after your baby nurses if you're preparing to go back to work and will be pumping to build up your stashed bottles you should absolutely invest in an electric double pump you can probably find a good price on ebay if all you want is to express a little milk so you can introduce your baby to a bottle try pumping just before feedings you should pump until your milk stops flowing or slows down dramatically and if you normally leak during feedings try to place a second bottle under the other breast so as not to waste those extra drops  Breast pump Baby bottle Milk Infant formula Infant Breast milk Nestl__ Carburetor Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Pump Wind turbine Childbirth Infusion pump Conker's Bad Fur Day International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Fertility awareness Pump It Up Hydrogen economy Alcohol fuel Intravenous therapy Insulin Nipple piercing Electronic organ Breast Toilet humour Tea Max Martin Vacuum Premature birth Internal ballistics B-47 Stratojet Short selling Siphon Chernobyl accident Deflation (economics) Bong Jaundice Free trade PHP Industrial Revolution Tire Shark Three Mile Island Energy development Renewable energy Refrigerator Newcomen steam engine Mastitis Hybrid vehicle Plastic Domestic goat Thermal power station Sea-Monkey Nestl__ boycott Brewery Champagne (beverage) Gross domestic product Sewage treatment Jet engine Glossary of firefighting equipment The Caves of Androzani Dialysis Steam engine Solar power Prolactin Coffee Petroleum Inflation Renewable energy development Hydraulic ram HIV The Suffering (game) Kitchen Portable stove Windmill Prolactinoma Internet fraud Automobile Cavitation Economy of Rwanda Single malt Scotch Biosphere 2 Economy of Russia Futurama (TV series - season 3) Eldfell Joke Britney Spears Air conditioning Fountain pen Action potential Compiler optimization London Underground The Super Milk-chan Show Implications of peak oil E85 Indianapolis 500

autism what causes it what can i do to prevent it i'm afraid to take my daughter month old for her shots i'm as crunchy granola and counter cultural as they come and i'll tell you the link between shots and autism is a myth it started when mercury was used in the creation of vaccines but mercury is not used anymore there has been a rise in autism but whether it's an actual rise or just better diagnosing is uncertain there are so many pollutants and chemicals our children are exposed to everyday through the food drink clothes furnishings toys etc etc that i think it's just wishful thinking on the part of some that the increase in autism cancer etc can be pinned on any one thing such as vaccines do some research into the diseases these vaccines prevent see what a baby sick with these goes through and dies from and you can see that the development of these was a miracle every day you take a risk when you leave the house with your baby but you do go out the risk is higher getting in the car than getting a shot the hysteria over shots in some people is i think an attempt to pretend they can control that which cannot be totally controlled no matter what your baby's safety health and happiness you can do your very very absolute most obsessive best and i think that's a good thing but you have to admit that some circumstances will be up to luck chance genetics environmental pollution whatever welcome to motherhood honey constant worry that there's some something you should be doing that you're not we're all in the same boat just try to relax and enjoy your little darling anyway o  Autism Thimerosal Controversies in autism Vaccine Cancer MMR vaccine Mark Geier Autism rights movement Breastfeeding Epidemiology Asperger syndrome AIDS Precautionary principle Thomas Verstraeten Malaria Coeliac disease Pesticide Measles Refrigerator mother Andrew Wakefield Left-handed EastEnders Autistic enterocolitis Autistic community Pneumonia Asthma Multiple sclerosis Dioxin Richard Deth Smallpox Abortion debate Nutrition Kodocha Genetically modified food DDT Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Microeconomics 2000 Simpsonwood CDC conference Mercury (element) Prostate cancer Poliomyelitis Safe Minds Health insurance Birth control Ultraviolet Bernard Rimland Biological warfare Tobacco smoking Dave Weldon Bioterrorism Public health Common cold Herpes simplex virus Asbestos Growth hormone treatment Colorectal cancer Minamata disease Anti-psychiatry Childbirth Allergy Externality Vampire Androgen insensitivity syndrome Coffee Pollution HIV vaccine Polyvinyl chloride Cytomegalovirus Anorexia nervosa People's Republic of China Tocopherol Mobile phone radiation and health Medical analysis of circumcision Cryptorchidism H5N1 Vacuum Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Infantilism Mumps Ferret Breast cancer Alzheimer's disease Pet skunk Ionizing radiation Barbara Boxer Light pollution Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Public policy Autistic spectrum National Institutes of Health Sickle-cell disease

is there any problem if i do not start feeding solid food to a months old baby but only breastfeeding i have a months old baby girl i haven't started giving her any baby food yet is this affect to the baby's future development she is heavier than average weight and very healthy right now should i start the baby food right away or can i start whenever i feel it's ready you can start introducing solids when you're ready anytime before the first year but i think the reason they say to introduce certain foods is that your baby needs more iron that what can be given via breastmilk alone perhaps shortly you could start with baby cereal that has been iron fortified i was just reading that in the 's they didnt offer children solids until they were yrs old in france that seems crazy nowadays doesnt it some start at just a few mths way too early she's probably heavier than avg because she's just drinking milk which has more calories than fruits and veggies do i started solids quite slowly at around mths with my daughter but continued nursing quite often until she was mths before slowing down a little she went up from the curve during that time and gained more than others her age i just read your other responses they are a bit over reacting it's no solids until at least mths nowadays if they bother keeping up with things that means you can start later i went to a lll meeting and the organiser said she didnt start solids until mths with her baby her normal dr was completely ok with this but when she went in for an appt a replacement was there since the original dr was sick the replacement went off on how terrible this was she hadnt started solids and it was close to child abuse etc etc not even close my daughter's going to wake up any minute but let me see if i cant find you an article about delayed solids ok here we go from kellymom the following organizations recommend that all babies be exclusively breastfed no cereal juice or any other foods for the first months of life not the first months world health organization unicef us department of health human services american academy of pediatrics american academy of family physicians american dietetic association australian national health and medical research council royal australian college of general practitioners health canada most babies will become developmentally and physiologically ready to eat solids by months of age for some babies delaying solids longer than six months can be a good thing for example some doctors may recommend delaying solids for months if there is a family history of allergies here's another article that talks about i guess this myth that all of us have about a baby needed extra food than breastmilk their first year for the iron see link below for full article introducing solids ensures that a baby is not deprived of necessary iron in his diet anemia is uncommon in the breastfed baby due to the following reasons a healthy full term infant has ample iron stores at birth to last him at least for the first twelve months of life although the amount of iron in breastmilk is small it is readily absorbed at a rate of compared to of the iron in formula this is due to the high levels of lactose and vitamin c in human milk which aid in the absorption of iron and breastfed babies do not lose iron through their bowels as do formula fed infants whose intestines develop fissures from damage caused by cow's milk so there ya go dont worry about solids at all for now as lack of iron shouldnt be a concern either  Infant formula Coeliac disease Tocopherol Nutrition Prostate cancer Vegetarianism Hypoglycemia Insulin Childbirth Crohn's disease Vitamin C Vitamin D Omega-3 fatty acid Urinary incontinence Anemia Protein-energy malnutrition Breast milk Growth hormone treatment Infantilism Dietary fiber Dairy Chronic fatigue syndrome Cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Fecal incontinence Food Medicine Medical analysis of circumcision Ulcerative colitis Pregnancy Atkins Nutritional Approach Nestl__ boycott Puberty Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Healthy eating Stomach cancer Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Vegetarian nutrition Glycogen storage disease type I Tooth International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Fertility awareness Guinea pig Autism Tooth enamel Aspartame Chocolate Domestic rabbit Obesity Egg (food) Cat Soy milk Hamster Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prolactinoma Food allergy CPU cache Infant Dog Organic food Fasting Nurse Obstetrics Soybean Abortion Adjustable gastric band Terri Schiavo Malaria Raw food diet Clinical depression Abortion debate Fancy rat Vitamin Polychlorinated biphenyl Carburetor Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Calorie restriction Human height Jaundice Medical prescription Allergy Midwifery Insomnia Physician Sleep Overpopulation Thimerosal United Nations

some questions about breastfed babies preferably from breastfeeding moms or ones who have breastfed my month old is strictly breastfed we have tried rice cereal mixed with breastmilk times and i think we are going to wait until months to start a food ritual his doctor told me at months i could start him on solids but i don't feel as if it is time yet when is a good time to introduce a sippy cup what to put in the sippy cup when should i give him water first foods other than cereal right now all he gets is my milk and the occasional milkshake i just shake my chest before he nurses i plan on nursing past a year hopefully if all goes well yeah i am serious about the milkshake it just came to me one day so it is a household joke now a good time to introduce a sippy cup is when your child can sit up unassisted and grip a toy and bring it to his mouth you can put expressed breast milk in the cup at first because it is familiar to him i wouldn't give him water until he's eating more solid foods until then he doesn't need water watch out for the juices they can cause diarrhea and then a diaper rash if your son is sensitive to the sugar and acid most of my kids weren't able to tolerate juice until they were potty trained they just ate fruit instead other than cereal you can feed your baby anything that is the right consistency my kids all ate bananas squash sweet potatoes green beans peas potatoes anything you can either throw in the blender raw or cooked after they got used to those single foods i started introducing mixtures love the comment about the milkshake once my older kids were putting on a theater production for me in the living room to amuse me while i was nursing the baby and i was laughing so hard at my little dramatists that the baby lost her latch and started crying my son years old at the time told me mom no fair she didn't order a milkshake  Breakfast Food Cuisine of the Philippines Milkshake Milk Peruvian cuisine Ice cream Jewish cuisine Diarrhea Vegetarianism Cuisine of Denmark Cuisine of Africa Tofu Folic acid Cuisine of the Southern United States Kosher foods Fecal incontinence Cuisine of Singapore Chocolate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cheese Japanese cuisine Bread Rice pudding Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of Brazil Banana Bengali cuisine The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Veganism Tea Food preservation Chili con carne Pancake Roman eating and drinking Infant Russian cuisine Dairy In-N-Out Burger Porridge Single certification Breakfast cereal German cuisine Comanche Humphrey Bogart Soul food Cereal Toilet humour Piccolo Junior Saga Potato Maize Krusty the Clown Childbirth Kodocha Muesli Infant formula RuneScape quests Tomato Soup Tooth Cuisine of Laos Common Agricultural Policy Soy milk Dietary fiber Joke Mnemonic Little Britain Nestl__ boycott Ron and Fez Japanese tea ceremony Recurring South Park characters Nestl__ The Ashlee Simpson Show Rice Korean cuisine Breast milk Rum Bubble tea Agriculture Agriculture in Australia McDonald's Brassiere Elimination communication Bart chalkboard gags Mojave people The dozens Maple syrup Coffee Hamster Fertility awareness Vinegar Coeliac disease Care Bears Escherichia coli O157:H7

signs of teething my son is months old and he is crying a lot these days could he be teething already even though its rare at this age and how can i tell it's not too son although months may not be the average every baby is different so he definetely could be the first signs of teething usually begin a few months before the first tooth appears so you will need to look for particular symptoms to ensure that the symptoms you notice are truly teething related the top signs of teething are irritability as the new tooth rises closer to the surface your baby s gums may become increasingly more sore and painful leading to fussiness and crying drooling from three to four months of age you may see your baby start drooling more often than normal teething stimulates drooling which may be worse with some babies than others coughing the increase in saliva can cause your baby to occasionally cough or gag as long as your baby shows no signs of a cold or flu and does not run a high fever this is noting to worry about chin rash if your baby is a heavy drooler the constant contact with saliva may cause the skin around the chin and mouth to become irritated gently wipe your baby s mouth and chin periodically throughout the day to help prevent chapped skin and rashes biting gnawing a teething baby will gnaw and gum down on anything the counter pressure from biting helps relieve the pressure from under the gums and temporarily numbs the pain teething aids designed specifically for babies are safe and effective cheek rubbing and ear pulling pain in the gums may spread to the ears and cheeks particularly when the back molars begin coming in this is why you may see your baby rubbing their cheeks or pulling at their ears however keep in mind that pulling at an ear can also be a sign of an ear infection especially when accompanied by a fever diarrhea most parents usually notice slightly looser bowel movements when a baby is teething a recent study done by the children s hospital in australia found this to be the most common symptom of teething yet many doctors still disagree and discount diarrhea as a symptom of teething the most likely cause of diarrhea during teething is the extra saliva swallowed which then loosens the stool report any diarrhea that lasts for more than three bowel movements to your doctor low grade fever a fever is another symptom that doctors are sometimes hesitant to directly link with teething many parents however find their baby gets a low grade fever while teething notify your doctor if the temperature rises above c f or if the temperature remains elevated for more than days not sleeping well you may find your child wakes more often at night most parents agree that night waking occurs more frequently when the molars are coming in cold like symptoms runny nose etc some parents find that their baby displays cold like symptoms when teething runny noses coughing and general cold symptoms are believed to be a result of frequent hand to mouth movements in an attempt to alleviate the pain notify your doctor if cold like symptoms occur for more than days and do not improve on their own  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chronic fatigue syndrome Group A streptococcal infection Tooth Domestic rabbit Coeliac disease Stomach cancer Fecal incontinence Prostate cancer Diarrhea Childbirth Allergy Pneumonia Dental caries Hay fever Measles Cat Cytomegalovirus Cancer Syphilis Ebola Escherichia coli O157:H7 Rabies Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hypoglycemia First aid Infectious mononucleosis Stroke Clinical depression Rotavirus Reflexology Herpes simplex virus Radiation therapy Psoriasis Lupus erythematosus Influenza Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Asthma Equine conformation Malaria Diving Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Methamphetamine Food allergy Chlorpromazine Ulcerative colitis Gastroesophageal reflux disease Drowning Mumps Marburg virus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Certified Nursing Assistant Yarrow Colorectal cancer Eczema Medical analysis of circumcision Lyme disease Hypertension Decompression sickness Thermoregulation Stuttering Epilepsy Poliomyelitis Autism Charles Darwin's illness Elephant Psychosis Swimming Aspartame Vitamin C Hyperthermia Jam (TV series) Drill bit Endometriosis Dog training Sulfasalazine Smallpox Dehydration AIDS Bipolar disorder Body piercing Foot-and-mouth disease Diabetic neuropathy Infantilism Shaggy dog story Nasal congestion Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Hearing impairment Fertility awareness E85 Sleep apnea

baby pee on mattress my baby pee on our queen size mattress and on his crib will the wetness in the mattress creates mold that will be bad for the baby and us thanks yes it depends on how you clean and dry the mattress moisture will cause all kinds of problems with this stain if it is allowed to ferment etc you have to try to remove as much of the stain as possible by blotting the stain or using a upholstery attachment and a carpet cleaning machine and wet cleaning it or even wetting it down and using a wet vacuum remove as much of the stain as possible try these techniques if the stain is fresh you can use the dish soap and water mixture described in most of our carpet spot cleaning tips as a spotting agent or you can buy an enzyme based cleaner mix with warm water and pour over the stain let set and rinse out with water blot as much of the moisture as possible or vacuum up as much of the moisture as possible it can be very difficult to remove this kind of stain since if too much moisture or stain has made it to the inside it is hard to effectively clean it you can also dry out the mattress in the sun since the sun has disinfecting qualities you will know you when have completely dried the stain by the odor best of luck  Mattress Upholstery Dry cleaning Vacuum cleaner Casting Soap Plastic Tofu Soldering Bong Carpet Cheese Diving suit Water Textile manufacturing Sodium hypochlorite Brewery Menstrual cup Gram staining Tea Bedbug Paint Laundry detergent Pottery Sugar beet Carnivorous plant Dishwasher Hamster Carbon dioxide Water purification Bread Sake Sterilization (microbiology) Laundry Hydrogen peroxide Concrete Vinegar Car washing techniques Compost Hard water Urinary incontinence Western blot Hay Fire extinguisher Bacteria Shampoo Instant coffee Dishwashing Sewage treatment Genericized trademark Home repair Toxic mold Disinfection Thermal power station Strap-on dildo Tattoo Survival skills Wood Sulfuric acid Hemp Vacuum Beer Wine making Fan (implement) Rice Bulk vending Roomba Tanning Durian Solar power Washing machine Agar plate Fecal incontinence Kosher foods Ultraviolet Hand washing Carbon fiber Dialysis Energy development Sugar Polyurethane Sand casting Violin Hard disk Houseplant Enzyme Jute Sauna Silage Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Glossary of wildland fire terms Bonsai

can anyone explain how you dealt with being unable to bond with your baby my son's girlfriend has said she hates this baby he was a preemie and spent the first weeks of his life in the nicu about an hours drive away he is an excellent baby such a bundle of joy i bonded with both of my boys instantly so i'm having a hard time understanding this can anyone shed some light on this for me he is months old now no i never told her i bonded with my boys immediately she had a terrible pregnancy as well she was so sick hospitalized times for dehydration etc then spent weeks on total bed rest before she gave birth it really was a nightmare for her i had a difficult pregnancy months of throwing up and a blood clot at weeks after the blood clot i had months of painfully twice daily sots to disolve the clot i felt horrible most of my pregnancy i started to see giving birth not as a joyful time but as end to my nightmare i was induced at weeks but after hours of not dilating at all i had to have a c section c sections can be very tough on a person despite what some people say i did not want to see my baby i just wanted to be finished with everything i remember being rather annoyed that i had to bring her home thankfully i had a supportive husband and a wonderful and understanding mother i was able to talk about my feeling my mother came over almost everyday to help me recover and to help me take care of my daughter i was unable to breastfeed because my milk took over days to come in i started to exclusively pump to give my daughter the important antibodies in breastmilk she is months and i am still pumping but i missed out on the special bond that happens while a mother breastfeed i read an article that suggested that a bond can be created when a parent co sleeps so that exactly what i started to do when my daughter was a few weeks old co sleeping or even just taking naps together might really help the mother of your grandson i suspect she is also having some post partem depression that can be helped in a variety of ways talking to friends and family like i did going to therapy and or being put on some anti depressantes try to be understanding you did elaborate on the circumstances of the birth but if she had this baby prematurely then it sounds like she was probably going through alot at the time of the birth not everyone bonds instantly with their baby now my daughter is months and i can truly say that being a mom is the most wonderful thing in the world although at times the most diffcult as well i love her more than i can express it did take quite a while and the process was slower than i would have wanted i hope that she gets some help and is able to feel like i do about my child  Stroke Pregnancy EastEnders Premature birth Kodocha Knots Landing Infant Miscarriage Shaggy dog story Abortion Days of our Lives History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cytomegalovirus Fertility awareness Folic acid Friends Traumatic brain injury About a Boy Hollyoaks Sharon Tate Married... with Children Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma One Tree Hill (TV series) Tupac Shakur Urinary incontinence One Life to Live Milton H.

breastfeeding troubles help my son is weeks old and we have been doing this exclusively without problems since he was in the hospital at birth after the first week there were basically no issues latching on and he is growing very well as i have a good milk supply within the pat week he has been going through a growth spurt ever since this started after he feeds on each breast for minutes he's content for maybe minutes afterwards this includes one burp after each breast well once he is content he stops and minutes later he begins to act like he's hungry shoving his fist in his mouth open it wide in mid air while awake etc etc this is minutes after that feeding remember so i offer him a boob he'll suck for about minutes and become detatched and try and latch back on when he tries to latchback on he brings his fist to his mouth and tries to get a mouthful while pratically pushing my boob away on accident and also kicking his legs franctically and arching his back cont and eventually he'll get back on for a few more minutes and this will start all over it gets progressively worse over the next few minutes to the point where he'll be latched on and so frustrated he cries with my boob in his mouth i thought maybe he's not hungry and trying to give another signal but his diaper will be clean no gas that i know of and he gives me all the signs of eing extra hungry what is the deal and why the sudden problems with staying latched he has no problem getting a mouthful it's when he open his mouth wide he pushes his head back while trying to grab on i'm getting so frustrated and i feel like i'm doing something wrong oh and i have to mention this only happens at night before bed no other time not in the middle of the night and no time during the day oh and i have to mention this only happens at night before bed no other time not in the middle of the night and no time during the day babies at this age hit a growth spurt he's growing and so is his appetite the more he sucks the more milk you'll have at the next feeding let him nurse as long as he needs he's just trying to make sure without knowing it that he has enough milk for the next feeding he may also be just a bit restless at night not wanting to go to sleep but not wanted to stay awake either try wrapping him up tight this will prevent him from knocking the breast away give him a week or so it will all straighten out i've been a laleche volunteer for years i know it's a trying time but you made it this far and don't give up  Shaggy dog story EastEnders Traumatic brain injury Infant Childbirth Puberty New York Giants Equine conformation Breast Aerial (dance move) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Red Hot Chili Peppers Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Knots Landing Swingout Fecal incontinence Piccolo Junior Saga Professional wrestling throws Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Shawn Michaels M60 machine gun Mattress Carburetor Eddie Guerrero Characters in the Smurfs Dairy Breaststroke The Amazing Race Bong Diving Professional wrestling holds Urinary incontinence Undergarment Stroke Hypoglycemia Milk Cat Elephant STS-61 National Football League Insomnia She Loves You Knife Glossary of American football Sin City The Contender (television series) Milton H.

grunting and wheezing noises my mth old was sent to childrens hospital to check for respritory distress due to grunitng when exhaling and wheezing noises docotrs took x rays stating nothing wrong and noises normal but he wouldn't make the noises in the hopsital when the doctors or nurses where tthere he did them in front of the pediatrician that refered us to the hospital and so i then video taped him and played it to the pediatrician who is now refering us to a pulminolgist anyone had such problems he really grunts alot when laying on his back and can only sleep like and hr at a time we rolled him on his belly two nights ago and he sleeps for hrs on average please no sid's freak outs we are careful to watch him all night but he can't get any sleep otherwise which made him just screaming for lack of sleep but his grunting mostly goes away when on his belly and he sleeps but now he stopped pooping perhaps it could also be the tempature in the room cause if u find out he has got problems then that could one of the things that trigger it off for example he could have some sort of asthma i know my self when am in room where its stuffy i can feel myself wheezy and breathing hard perhaps it is the same for him but he is getting it worse due him only being a month old has he been checked for asthma or has anyone in ur family got asthma as for stop pooping the only thing i can think is not enough fiber in his food or might have something wrong with his bowel anyways i hope this helped a little bit hope ur wee boy gets better soon  Asthma Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breastfeeding Sin City Urinary incontinence Fecal incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Toilet humour 2000 Australian Grand Prix Shaggy dog story Chronic fatigue syndrome Triage Kingdom Hospital Sudden infant death syndrome Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Psychiatric hospital The Shining (film) Mattress EastEnders Pitaten Allergy Breath of Fire III One Tree Hill (TV series) 1957 World Series The Long Game Marilyn Monroe Hypoglycemia Full Metal Panic?

my son refuses to eat what to do my son is mnths old and he hate to eat vegetables he only want sweet stuff like cereals in the morning and fruits in the afternoon he drinks the bottle but when it comes to vegtables he cried like i am killing him i tried to force him he vomits the food sometimes he prefers to sleep than to eat until i gave up the plan and give him his bottle months is a little too young to be forcing foods on if he doesn't want them at this age he should be just experimenting with new tastes and textures and it can take a number of tries before a baby accepts a new food so continue to offer small tastes of different foods provided that they're age appropriate but don't worry if he doesn't eat them for now give him what he will eat he should still be relying primarily on formula or breastmilk for nourishment anyway solids should be just a supplement and not a major portion of his diet until closer to or months do make sure that the things you are giving him are nutritious though he shouldn't be eating any sugary cereals at this point oatmeal or cheerios are good options it sounds like he's eating fruit okay so that's good enough for now you might try to introduce some of the sweeter veggies such as sweet potatoes or creamed corn and see if he likes those but if not don't worry about it too much just yet  Breakfast Breastfeeding Breakfast cereal Vegetarianism Cuisine of Denmark Food Cuisine of the Philippines Hamster Jewish cuisine Vegetarian cuisine Veganism Fecal incontinence Bread Potato New Coke Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Trailer Park Boys Organic food Roman eating and drinking Plantain Sweetcorn Snack food Mountain Dew Cuisine of Malaysia Peruvian cuisine Bengali cuisine Little Britain Wine Tea Soup Tofu Fancy rat Healthy eating Chocolate Domestic rabbit Cuisine of the Southern United States Porridge Cuisine of Africa Folic acid Barbecue Cat McDonald's Cuisine of Brazil Cuisine of Argentina 613 mitzvot Hamburger Vegetarianism and religion Cha chaan teng Shaggy dog story French cuisine Soft drink Carnivore Pizza Coca-Cola Sugar substitute Fast food Russian cuisine Dumpling Cheese Dieting Singlish Fasting Knots Landing Guinea pig Fish and chips Cuisine of Singapore FoxTrot Beer Adjustable gastric band Hot dog Soybean Ramen Atkins Nutritional Approach Full English breakfast Fruits Basket Domesticated turkey Oreo The Coca-Cola Company Peanut butter Maize Chili con carne John the Baptist The Wack Pack Famine Characters in the Smurfs Tooth Polish cuisine

why won't my week old sleep my week old daughter won't sleep at all during the day and is awake for anything up to hours at a time i have read that newborns are supposed to sleep for up to hours during the day but i can't get her to sleep it is now also starting to affect the night time sleep too and she is constantly restless and wakes throughout the night i am exhausted and can't get her to sleep she is tired too and is fighting herself to fall asleep i have tried putting her down in her cot and letting her cry herself to sleep but she cries until she chokes and i have to pick her up she wont sleep anywhere cot bed sling rocker chair nowhere has anyone experienced this please help doctor is on holiday until for the next two weeks so won't be seeing her until then please help thanks she is bottle fed and is drinking up to mils per feed and is very content after drinking she falls asleep after a feed but when i put her down she awakes five to ten minutes later and wont go back down have tried patting shushing etc and not picking her up but again she cries until she chokes and i have to pick her up also have tried infacol and gripe water this made her ten times worse she is currently on gaviscon infant for gastro reflux but its not helping will make app to see second doc asap my daughter was the same way she barely slept but she was also very fussy and cried off and on in the evenings turned out she has silent reflux and it took us about weeks to figure out why she wasn't sleeping it's uncomfortable for babies with reflux so they're known for not sleeping much there's a link below to see if your daughter may have any of the symptoms if so being that your doctor is out of town you could try calling one of the nurses and ask them what the proper dose of maalox would be for your daughter the night before we figured out what was wrong with my daughter she had only slept maybe or hours the entire day and she got almost hyper from lack of sleep i called the after hours nurse and she said it's not normal for a baby to not sleep and told me to get some maalox and give her some of that and see if it helped at that age letting her cry won't do any good she's too young to soothe herself to sleep but i understand having to do it i had to get away from my daughter after days of that and i would just go and take a hot shower just to have some peace and my husband would take her if you have anyone that can help you during the day so you can get a little sleep for me i knew something was wrong and i was going back to work after weeks so i needed to solve it before then if you suspect it could be reflux keep her elevated for at least minutes after a feeding and keep her head elevated while she sleeps the doctor told us we could give our daughter the maalox times a day for our daughter that didn't help and we did end up having to put her on prevacid solutabs which have helped immensely is there any other doctor in the office that could see your daughter i know at our pediatrician's office they have other doctor's cover when ours is off on vacation or has a day off does she sleep if you hold her i spent weeks holding my daughter and sleeping on the couch just so i could get some sleep do what you have to to get some sleep till you can get back to the doctor good luck gripe water may also help a little it helped with my daughter's fussiness and gas that sometimes comes with having reflux  Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Knots Landing Milton H.

when shopping for a walker what type of things should i be looking for what age is appropiate to buy a walker for baby the american academy of pediatrics recommends against using walkers not only because they can discourage your child from learning to walk on their own but also because they can be dangerous so many babies end up in emergency rooms and doctor's offices from falling down stairs or bumping into furniture while in a walker if you really want one get one that has stair fall protection either a gripping mechanism that keeps the walker from going over the edge of a stairwell or a design that prevents the walker from fitting through a doorway keep in mind that some manufacturers continue to ignore these standards so do your homework good luck  Stairway Breastfeeding Climbing equipment Screw Baby transport Basement Tire Humphrey Bogart Animal Crossing Glossary of climbing terms Anchor Upholstery Medicine M16 (rifle) Theory of conduct 2000 Australian Grand Prix Switch Eastern Illinois University Pediatrics M60 machine gun Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Elevator Knife Timecop Door Shaggy dog story Glossary of firefighting terms Glossary of firefighting equipment Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Charles Goodyear Spanking School bus Amulet Merchant Taylors' School General practitioner Hiking Kimberly-Clark Corporation Dalek variants Diving Phimosis Rose (Doctor Who) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Diving cylinder Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Ethical consumerism Walker tariff American Academy of Pediatrics Heinkel He 100 Growth hormone treatment Washington Monument Childbirth Bicycle helmet BS 1363 Road safety Spark plug Strap-on dildo Passenger car Dalek Professional wrestling throws Milton H.

does supply and demand for breastfeeding work on both breasts together or independently of each other can i theoretically feed from one boob only and the other will respond accordingly my daughter really doesn't like my left breast she will feed from it but is really fussy and the let down is incredibly slower on that side and she rarely 'empties' it where as she feeds fantastcally from the other side i have tried all sorts of things to even this out chances are if you mention it here i've done it but it doesn't seem to be a problem just to let her nurse primarily from the one side now i'm not getting engorged on the other side at all but it just led me to wonder might there actually be a problem with one side i know breastpreference is common or is it quite normal for one side to produce less in response to lower demand and the other carry on as normal thanks the side she doesn't like is the one where she lays on her right side to feed the side she always turns onto to sleep so i don't understand that one i always tend to start on the fussy side and then switch but i'm not that lop sided so i'm not worried about that i can't pump nothing comes out i can hand express but it's really slow and i don't really have the time thanks for the information so far sounds like it's not a problem and doesn't seem to be for my daughter if i just let her do her own thing so i think i'll continue to do that supply and demand is independent if you stop using the one breast eventually it'll stop producing milk or it will produce a very small amount if she 's happy with the one breast i wouldn't be too concerned but it would be good to try and keep both breasts producing milk when your baby goes through a growth spurt she may need the other breast too give pumping another try at first most women can't let down to a pump but eventually it starts to work also pumping will help if the reason your baby fusses is slow milk flow you could also have her doc examine her to make sure nothing is bothering her when she lies on that side it could be something you can't see you can of course get by on only one breast if she keeps stimulating it but if you can help it maybe you shouldn't let the other one dry up it's nice to have the option of using it if you need it good luck with everything  Urinary incontinence Puberty Breast pump Prostate cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Childbirth Dairy Singlish Theory of conduct Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Milk Inflation Hypoglycemia Infant Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Aerial (dance move) Action potential Breast milk Brassiere Prolactinoma Carburetor Floppy disk Supply and demand Fertility awareness Carbon dioxide Thermal power station Microeconomics Electrophysiology Abortion Chicken Insomnia Humphrey Bogart Keynesian economics Deflation (economics) Baby bottle Supply-side economics Knots Landing Renewable energy Quicksort Cancer Human height Dialysis Nestl__ Law of value Transformer Mastitis Nestl__ boycott Nipple Blood pressure Goodness and value theory Shaggy dog story Myocardial infarction Carnivorous plant Kodocha Labor theory of value Ethics Hydrogen economy FoxTrot Philosophy of language Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Gross domestic product Prolactin Eldfell Neopets Coffee Unemployment Extreme Programming Lac operon Economics Hiberno-English RISC Indianapolis 500 Surplus value The nature of God in Western theology Human penis size Recurring South Park characters Piccolo Junior Saga Jet engine Gas metal arc welding Shit Samuel Goldwyn Wind turbine Infantilism Overpopulation Jam (TV series) Wood Backstroke Breast cancer Sharon Tate Nipple piercing Premature birth

my friend just had a baby who weighs lbs oz is that normal it seems really small to me pounds is the low end of 'average' so the baby is really on the cusp smallish but not significantly the biggest difficulty for small babies is maintaining body temperature so your friend would be well advised to keep little socks and a hat on the baby until it gains some weight  Weight Pound Breastfeeding Dialysis Birth weight Dieting Hypothermia Blue Whale Mario Anorexia nervosa Weight training Obesity Normal distribution InuYasha (character) Weighing scale Humphrey Bogart Super Size Me Mass Charmed Chevrolet Corvair Explosive material Big Pun Atkins Nutritional Approach Knife Great White Shark Beach Car safety Paragliding Coeliac disease Nuclear fusion Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hyperthermia Red Deer Pregnancy Infantilism Heat Engine cooling Temperature Hydrogen economy Supercharger Puberty Anchor Milk Static Shock Childbirth Fetal development Breech birth Mixed martial arts Ostrich Steel Baby Blues Concentration Thermoregulation Lady and the Tramp MOSFET Shotgun Premature birth Mario Kart: Double Dash!!

how long should my month old stay awake between naps i'm trying to help my month old baby get onto a good routine when she was months she used to take a nap about every hrs or so adding up to naps per day her naps were short only mins long now at months she recently started fighting her naps when i put her down at the first sleepy signs she yawns fusses rubs eyes almost exactly hrs after she last woke up so i've recently started keeping her up hrs at a time just so that she'll go down easy for her naps is this too long to keep her up i feel bad ignoring her sleepy signs at the hr mark but she just ends up fighting her nap for another hour anyway if i try to put her down as soon as she acts tired now she takes naps per day but i can never know how long they will be sometimes her nap is mins other days it's hrs if she takes short naps i'll either try to give her a rd nap she often resists it unless in the car or give her early bedtime like pm instead of pm what do you think they do like to keep us on our toes don't they my month old naps after an hour and a half displaying all the signs you speak of above and so i put her down and she goes off at the moment but my older daughter would fight it at times at various ages i don't think there is a should with babies i think you need to work toward what you think is right for your baby but i would suggest maintaining a good routine anyway despite her protstations after all a baby doesn't know what is good for her however she may protest as she gets older and understands there is more exciting stuff to stay up for babies can get overtired if their sleep is delayed making a good deep sleep even harder to get later on but if you feel the delaying is helping her sleep better then go with it i do the earlier bedtime as well depending on my daughters naps her naps also vary in length i just let her have what she needs  Sleep Narcolepsy Cat Polyphasic sleep Siesta Daylight saving time Breastfeeding Social rule Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Battle of the Bulge Sleep debt 1957 World Series Blitzball Jon Secada Urinary incontinence Apollo 8 2000 Australian Grand Prix Delayed sleep phase syndrome Spirit rover timeline for 2004 April Time Out of Mind Kodocha Textile manufacturing Equine conformation Care Bears Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Current teachings of Prem Rawat Fertility awareness Aerial (dance move) Insomnia Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Lucid dreaming Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sharon Tate Housebreaking Decompression sickness The Care Bears (television series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Characters in the Smurfs The Amazing Race Electrophysiology Bodybuilding Jam (TV series) Diazepam Avenue Q Gordon Banks Poker jargon EastEnders Bruxism Parsifal Saturday Night Live Characters of The Sandman Autism Diaper Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Marching band Maya calendar Prostate cancer One (Voyager episode) Hipparchus (astronomer) Stuttering Cleveland Indians Father's Day (Doctor Who) Tupac Shakur Weight training Friends Fasting Yawn Milton H.

breast feeding mastitis if i have been breast feeding and i feel theres a lump in my breast called mastitis why does that occur an how do i get rid of it from dr jack newman mastitis is a bacterial infection of the breast that usually occurs in breastfeeding mothers however it can occur in women who are not breastfeeding or pregnant and can occur even in small babies of either sex nobody knows exactly why some women get mastitis and others do not bacteria may gain access to the breast through a crack or sore in the nipple but women without sore nipples also get mastitis and most women with cracks in the nipple do not mastitis needs to be differentiated from a plugged or blocked duct because a plugged or blocked duct does not need treatment with antibiotics whereas mastitis often but not always requires treatment with antibiotics a blocked duct presents as a painful swollen firm mass in the breast the skin overlying the blocked duct is often quite red similar to what happens during mastitis but less intense mastitis is usually also associated with fever and more intense pain as well however it is not always easy to distinguish between a mild mastitis and a severe blocked duct both are associated with a painful lump in the breast without a lump in the breast one cannot make a diagnosis of mastitis or a blocked duct a blocked duct can apparently go on to become mastitis in france physicians also recognize something they call lymphangite that is fever associated with skin which is hot and red but there is no underlying painful mass they do not believe this requires treatment with antibiotics i have seen a few cases that fit this description in my practice and indeed the problem resolves without antibiotics but then often a full blow mastitis also resolves without antibiotics as with almost all breastfeeding problems a poor latch and thus poor draining of the breast sets up the situation where mastitis is more likely to occur the links below have great information on getting better take care of yourself drink lots of fluids nurse all you can and feel better soon  Pneumonia Group A streptococcal infection Chronic fatigue syndrome Androgen insensitivity syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Psoriasis Intravenous therapy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Childbirth Traumatic brain injury Conjunctivitis Cellulitis Cancer Gonorrhoea Nipple Fertility awareness Cytomegalovirus Common cold Lyme disease Dialysis Hepatitis Cirrhosis Pharyngitis Medicine Crohn's disease Fancy rat Brassiere Nipple piercing Erysipelas Herpes simplex virus Sickle-cell disease Medical analysis of circumcision Meningitis Prostate cancer Obstetrics Hip fracture AIDS Protein-energy malnutrition Gout Infant Malaria Reiter's syndrome Diarrhea Anthrax First aid Stomach cancer Mammary gland Appendicitis Abortion Ebola Infectious mononucleosis Insulin Botulism Stroke Autism Guinea pig Milk Bubonic plague Syphilis Chlorpromazine Penis Radiation therapy Escherichia coli O157:H7 Folic acid Tuberculosis Traditional Chinese medicine Otitis externa Penicillin Body piercing Spider Hypoglycemia Eczema Lymphatic system Psychosis Needle aspiration biopsy Lupus erythematosus Rheumatic fever Fibromyalgia Asthma Shrimp farm Mumps Jaundice Legionellosis Puberty Lymphogranuloma venereum Leptospirosis Cholecystitis Premature birth

my son still has cradle cap or cradle crap as we call it he is months old and he has had it since he was about months old i have seen the pediatrician several times for it but everything we try doesn't seem to help it looks painful sometimes it looks like it is oozing they different doctors say it is just cradle cap so its not that it is something else first they had me comb his hair while i shampooed we did this for a while and it didn't work then they had me try a cradle cap shampoo that didn't work and it left his hair greasy then they said try rubbing baby oil into his scalp and let it soften then comb and wash with shampoo now they have us using selson blue times a week he has been using this for about a month and still no improvement will this ever go away is there anything else i can try to do just an fyi my son has a ton of hair so it is hard to get to also takes a lot to get a brush down to the scalp through all that curly hair i switch back and forth between using a comb brush omg my son has had a yeast infection that we are treating with nystatin at the time although the yeast infection has only been for a month we did one treatment first and are on the nsytatin now and he has had the cradle cap for much longer is it possible that the one answerer was correct it could be a yeast infection on his scalp my youngest daughter had cradle cap until she was over one maybe even close to the doctor told me all those things not the selsun blue but i hated scrubbing her head it seemed like it hurt her they told me as long as i washed her hair and scrubbed her scalp gently let it be it would go away on its own and it did finally she also had curly hair so i understand it is hard to get to if you cannot see it and it does not bug him i would let it be for a while and see if it does go away she still gets it occasionally in little spots but never as much as she use to have if you are going to use something like selsun blue i would recommend trying neutrogena t sal it is a dandruff shampoo but works much better my grandma had what looked exactly like cradle cap on her head pretty bad gross i know but she is and pretty feeble my sister was visiting and had the t sal shampoo and with good scrubbing it removed all of it i was shocked it may be worth a try because once we finally got rid of it on my daughter it hardly came back and if it does it is small and can be washed off during a shampoo  Dandruff Shampoo Psoriasis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Breastfeeding Ranma __ characters Baldness treatments Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kodocha Acne Massage Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Haircut Textile manufacturing Theory of conduct Crab louse Comanche Prostate cancer Candidiasis Tattoo Three Stooges Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Characters in the Smurfs Guinea pig Dreadlocks Blood on the Tracks Norway national football team EastEnders Poker jargon Manicure First aid Pitaten Piccolo Junior Saga Chronic fatigue syndrome 2000 Australian Grand Prix Baldness It's Walky!

any tips on how to feed from both bottle and breast from the start i had a terrible time bfing my first children had to go to bottles eventually i simply do not produce enough milk and have tried all suggestions from both my doctor and the lactation specialist to skip the overwhelming disappointment of having to use bottles and not solely breast feed i plan to use both from birth with my next one how is the best way to do this to successfully i think i want to go or bottle breast itachi said 'feeding from bottle and breast isnt healthy for a child this makes them have the runs really bad because of your problem producing milk you should stick to bottle feeding ' that's simply untrue your child care classes lied to you both my kids had both for months with no issue and pedi's blessings but didn't start out that way from birth best way is to start w breast only for the first month then start pumping and trying a bottle or two a day this establishes your milk supply and teaches baby how to do it right bottles are too easy breastfed babies need to learn how to work for their milk once he she really has it down then doing both should be a breeze  Breastfeeding Fertility awareness Infant Breast pump Breast Breast milk Baby bottle Infant formula Prolactin Dairy Nipple Childbirth International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Nestl__ Urinary incontinence Mastitis Nestl__ boycott Platypus Recurring South Park characters Folic acid Cytomegalovirus Breast cancer Dairy farming Ben Johnson (athlete) Nipple piercing Mammary gland Puberty Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Androgen insensitivity syndrome Abortion Premature birth Pregnancy Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Chicken Indianapolis 500 Elephant Second Battle of the Atlantic Intravenous therapy Veganism Coeliac disease The Caves of Androzani Jaundice Bong B-47 Stratojet Glycogen storage disease type I Protein-energy malnutrition EastEnders Prolactinoma Toilet humour Nurse Guinea pig Insulin Hypoglycemia Yoko Ono Tea The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask characters Heracles Comanche Novelty (locomotive) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dioxin Days of our Lives Phoebe Halliwell About a Boy Domestic rabbit Tocopherol John Edwards Adoption Infantilism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hollyoaks Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Sharon Stone Uchiha Sasuke Postpartum depression Scurvy Happy Meal Vitamin D Dog Procrastination Sea-Monkey Abortion debate Sharon Tate Humphrey Bogart Carburetor Vitasoy Dairy cattle Spidey Super Stories Oral contraceptive Medical analysis of circumcision Agriculture Koala Overpopulation Cattle Fecal incontinence Conker's Bad Fur Day Paradox Theory of conduct

do you give your breast fed baby multivitamin supplements with iron my doctor recommended that i start giving my baby multivitamin supplements poli vi sol with iron as of months of age my baby is now almost months and i have actually only given the vitamins several times and discontinued to do so because i had read in my breastfeeding book the nursing mother's companion that it was not neccesary and that it could hinder some absorption of important nutrients that my breast milk is giving the baby i am a full time breastfeeding mommy and i have not started my baby on solids yet second question when i do start my baby on solids at months this is when i read he may need a vitamin supplement should i not give him the vitamins with iron because the cereal also has iron what is your experience with this thanks for all the responses i wanted to add some info i live in sunny california and because i live in a sunny climate i thought i did not need extra vit d i do take my baby on late afternoon walks daily where he receives indirect sunlight i dont think i have any defects in my milk supply i eat healthy and i have a seven year old who was also breast fed by me who is rarely ever sick and is an exceptional student i actually have a very healthy it seems little guy although on the larger side who was pounds ounces and in length at his month check up percentile for both it seems by most of your responses that it was good that i followed my instincts and choose not to give him the vitamins they seem so unnatural they stink and he made the worst face when he took it i actually plan to find a new pediatrician when my medical insurance changes i would love to hear more about people omitting cereal from their babies diets that is interesting thanks everyone the extra iron is not necessary though many doctors still don't know it because of their own lack of research your book was right when solids come just do foods rich in iron like leafy greens pureed steamed spinach unless your baby shows signs of some kind of deficiency no vitamins are necessary just a healthy varied diet for him and you are all that you need congrats good job and good luck  Veganism Tocopherol Milk Omega-3 fatty acid Vitamin D Guinea pig Vitamin C Coeliac disease Childbirth Vitamin Anemia Cyanocobalamin Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Nutrition Retinol Infant formula Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Healthy eating Dieting Vegetarian nutrition Rickets Hypoglycemia Domestic rabbit Hamster Prostate cancer Protein-energy malnutrition Golden rice Multiple sclerosis Atkins Nutritional Approach Chronic fatigue syndrome Fertility awareness Food Breast milk Breast Dog Egg (food) Terri Schiavo Cat Health insurance Growth hormone treatment Nestl__ boycott Pet skunk Bodybuilding Dairy Infant Prolactinoma Nipple piercing Human skin color Little Britain Malnutrition Organic food EastEnders Scurvy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Elephant Obesity Controversies in autism Obstetrics Vitamin poisoning Dietary fiber Puberty Alzheimer's disease Riboflavin Dietary supplement Brassiere Cystic fibrosis Polychlorinated biphenyl Spina bifida Anorexia nervosa Vitamin K Carpal tunnel syndrome Oily fish Urinary incontinence Antioxidant Newborn screening Clinical depression Koala Livestock Fancy rat Sharon Tate Insulin Nurse Ulcerative colitis Diarrhea Osteoporosis International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Nestl__ Rice

breastfeeding question i plan on breastfeeding my little one i know with formula they start off with ounces every certain amt of hours with breastfeeding how often and how much do you give your baby for each feeding and is it for like minutes on one breast burp them then some more on the other sorry i'm not sure of the details all answers are very appreciated sometimes it's easier to get nice quick answers instead of calling the doc my next appointment is august th thanks guys weeks and days pregnant with with breastfeeding if you are doing just breast each baby will vary they give signs when they are done when they are first learning they may need to be attached longer some woman choose to use one breast during one feeding and the other breast during the next some woman choose to do one breast for a few minutes then switch during one feeding it is your choice and you have to find what works best for you there are different positions to hold baby too and womans opinions vary on that as well one thing you should invest in is a bobby pillow because it can make the nursing a lot more comfortable newborns don't eat as much at one feeding but eat more frequently breastfed babies usually nurse more often than bottle fed formula babies because the breastmilk digests easier and faster so you may find you are breastfeeding every hour in the beginning then it will stretch to two hours it is a great bonding experience though so well worth all the time if you start breastfeeding at the hospital ask for a lactation consultant hospitals usually have one or more on staff and they can make sure you are holding baby right and that baby is latching on it is a great help to have their advice in the beginning and you can usually call them later if you have questions  Fertility awareness Infant Childbirth Infant formula Nipple piercing Milk Pregnancy Breast Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breast pump International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Nestl__ boycott Jaundice Stomach cancer EastEnders Abortion debate Brassiere Baby bottle Abortion Strap-on dildo Prolactin Guinea pig Haloperidol Breast cancer Elephant Hypoglycemia Premature birth Nipple Oxytocin Nestl__ The Apprentice 2 Terri Schiavo Obstetrics Mastitis Certified Nursing Assistant Japanese tea ceremony Prostate cancer Cytomegalovirus Nursing Protein-energy malnutrition Nurse Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

how do i dry my breast milk up hi i had a gorgeous baby girl in march and decided not to breast feed her as i had lots of problems a few years prior with my son latching on anyway my question is how do i get rid of my unwanted breast milk my mum said they use to sell kest tablets to help this but ive not been able to purchase any as i think they have been discontinued anyway can any one help thankyou lisa mum to a gorgeous little boy and girl don't wrap or bind your breasts in any way it's not going to work faster and can cause other issues it also takes time so any trick you try will help speed things up but won't just dry you up right away here's some herbal stuff herbs that may decrease milk supply using large amounts of the following herbs and other natural remedies should be avoided while nursing because they have been known to decrease milk supply the amounts of these herbs normally used in cooking are unlikely to be of concern it's mainly the larger amounts that might be used therapeutically that could pose a problem however some moms have noticed a decrease in supply after eating things like dressing with lots of sage sage tea often recommended when moms are weaning lots of strong peppermint candies or menthol cough drops or other foods teas with large amounts of the particular herb these herbs are sometimes used by nursing mothers to treat oversupply or when weaning black walnut chickweed herb robert geranium robertianum lemon balm oregano parsley petroselinum crispum peppermint mentha piperita menthol periwinkle herb vinca minor sage salvia officinalis sorrel rumex acetosa spearmint thyme yarrow http www kellymom com herbal herbs to avoid html  Breastfeeding Essential oil Sage Mint Menthol Yarrow Hamster Cough medicine Garlic Tea Herbal tea Oregano Omega-3 fatty acid Abortion Coffee Chicken soup EastEnders Insomnia Little Britain Parsley Dairy Milk Patent medicine Aloe Herbology Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cuisine of Denmark Veganism Antidepressant Polychlorinated biphenyl Tofu Traditional Chinese medicine Russian cuisine Scarborough Fair About a Boy Urinary incontinence Cantonese cuisine Microeconomics Food Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tobacco Diazepam Tocopherol Famine Nepeta Agriculture Prostate cancer Chocolate St John's wort My Little Pony RuneScape quests Comfrey Herbalism Cannabis (drug) Caffeine Vitamin C Weed control Stuttering Healthy eating Peruvian cuisine Pizza Phoebe Buffay's songs Haloperidol Breast implant Supply and demand Confectionery Japanese tea ceremony Nettle Fecal incontinence Puberty Italian cuisine Soy milk Breast milk Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Rooibos Ice cream Cheese Insulin Valerian (plant) Cancer Cuisine of Malaysia Red Hot Chili Peppers Hyssop Cuisine of Vietnam Mastitis Ron and Fez Comanche Infant Breast Kit Kat Lactose intolerance

where do you get the carseat installed for the st time i heard you should get your carseat installed so you know how to correctly do it where do you go do they do it at the hospital when u bring the baby home i live in va if that means anything they are strict about carseat laws i have a door car i want to make sure its installed safely for a newborn to all the ppl who think they know it all some jurisdictions require you to have the car seat installed so it meets the state standards before they let you leave the hospital i have it installed i need to make sure it meets standards go give someone else your ignorant answers and let the educated ppl answer my question we installed the car seats ourselves and then went to a car seat safety check run by the local police officers trained in car seat installation check to see whether you did it properly show you what you did right and what you did wrong remove the seats from the car review the proper installation with you and then essentially supervise you while you install it as the previous person indicated the hospital staff will not install car seat although they will ensure that you have a car seat installed before your baby is allowed to leave the hospital usually you can contact the local police department about installation inspection they usually have at least one permanent location at which you can schedule an appointment in addition to mobile safety checks that they may do a couple of times a year e g twice annually they may set up an all day installation inspection site at a local school these are free of charge and may or may not require an appointment in addition the national highway traffic safety administration has a search function so you can find who where such installations inspections are conducted near you you can find this at http www nhtsa dot gov people injury childps contacts index cfm and you can search by state or by zip code there is also a web site where you can look up carseat car compatability the information posted on that site is posted by users themselves and can be very helpful in determining whether a particular car seat works well in a particular car if you haven't purchased your carseat yet i recommend you look at this site and even if you have it can be found at http www carseatdata org the vast majority of car seats are improperly installed and i urge everyone to get them checked installed by someone who is specifically trained for that we have twins and we did the installation inspection for both the infant car seats they started out with and then for the convertible car seats they now use while many of the newer cars are equipped with the latch system and installation is in those vehicles easier than ever before we still found that our initial installation efforts were less than perfect and i'm very happy to have had the professionals correct my mistakes hope that helps best of luck and enjoy your newborn  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Airbag PHP United States Postal Service Domain Name System Speed limit Police system of Japan Automobile Breastfeeding STS-61 Plame affair Windows 2000 Car safety Toyota Camry Scientology beliefs and practices Elevator Common Unix Printing System Uniform Resource Locator Appeal OpenDocument Road-rule enforcement camera Condom Hong Kong Police Force 2005 United States Grand Prix Domestic AC power plugs and sockets OpenBSD Spyware Trademark Drunk driving (United States) Windows Vista XML Wi-Fi Daylight saving time Probation officer Linux distribution Floppy disk Traffic light Automatic number plate recognition Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Mozilla Firefox Wget Light rail Rules of the road Police Handloading Parachuting Pretty Good Privacy GameFAQs Childbirth Halting problem XHTML Mental Health Act 1983 Passenger car Mac OS X United States House of Representatives Gmail Linux Quantum computer National Kidney Foundation Singapore Education in the People's Republic of China Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Password GSM services TGV Annuity Web crawler Usenet Politics of Russia Drag racing MSN Messenger DVD HTTP cookie Unicode Burglar alarm Legal research Wayne Corporation MTR Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Airport Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina CPAN Segregated cycle facilities Government of Maryland Software testing Enterprise content management Cross site scripting Software engineering G__del's incompleteness theorem RFID

baby's personality my son is weeks and day old i still see no real trace of his own personality and i thought by this point he'd be smiling all the time he smiles occasionally and has times before when i was smiling at him goofing off but only about times in total recently he's been more fussy than ever before and i'm just curious why isn't he smiling yet and what's going on with his personality also it seems as if he is unable to focus on my eyes for very long without looking upwards he looks for a second if you get his attention but not every time i'm worried that something could be wrong pediatrician said everything was fine with him and he's a perfectly normal baby but why at weeks are all this things still happening is he just too young yet to completely focus he does focus but not for more than a few seconds and has only followed me with his eyes a couple of times a lot of the times it looks like he's spacing out my baby was fine and then around weeks became very fussy and unhappy for about a week then everything just changed once again and he was a happy baby at about weeks he started smiling and at this point weeks he smiles coos and makes little laughing noises it will all happen when you least expect it as for focusing attention even my boy seems like he is spaced out half the time especially when he is tired sometimes he just looks off into nowhere like he is looking at something really interesting even though nothing is there he shouldn't be able to really follow objects for very long until at least months and even then it is still only about inches don't worry nothing is wrong  Social rule Milton H.

how much should a month old baby eat and how often my baby is weeks old and she eats oz every hours and she's starting to get pretty chunky i was just wondering if she is eating to much and how much most week old babies eat that sounds right to me although every child is different some eat more and some eat less if she seems satisfied then it's fine if not then give her more if she pulls away or acts uninterested before the bottle is done then it's to much your little girl will let you know how much is enough if you are truly worried that she's getting chunky then ask your dr if she is still in a good range for her age and height please remember that babies need the extra fat s so they can grow healthy and strong they grow so much the first year usually triple their birth weight by their first birthday incredible isn't it keep up the good work i hope this helped  Breastfeeding Kodocha Kit Kat Childbirth Social rule Mnemonic Urinary incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Piccolo Junior Saga Jon Secada Elephant Puberty Humphrey Bogart Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys Chinese New Year Sesame Street Ron and Fez Negima Birth weight Atkins Nutritional Approach Comanche EastEnders Pregnancy Milk Super Size Me The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Tasmanian Devil YuYu Hakusho Koala Persona (video game) Blood on the Tracks Homer Simpson Cliff Richard Baby Blues Egg (food) Spirited Away Anorexia nervosa Cuisine of Denmark Hamster Guinea pig The Incredibles Santa Claus Body mass index Ben Johnson (athlete) One Piece minor characters Drawn Together Binge eating disorder Friends Charmed Hall & Oates Stomach cancer Generation Y Gwen Stefani Elvis and Me The Fairly OddParents Garfield Frankie Laine Infantilism Teen Girl Squad Invader Zim Fancy rat Pok__mon Live!

how do i get my son to stop breastfeeding and take a baby battle my son is months old and i just found out that i am pregnant again i was told that i should stop breastfeeding him but i have been trying to give him a baby battle for the past weeks and he just does not like it help me does anyone have any tips to help me get him to take a battle do you have placenta previa or some other pregnancy condition that prevents you from nursing did your doctor tell you to stop why did he she if not you don't have to stop if it was family friends telling you that you need to quit they're wrong is it safe to nurse during pregnancy yes in most cases at this time no medical study has been done on the safety of breastfeeding during pregnancy so it is impossible to list any definitive contraindications if you are having a complicated pregnancy such as lost weight bleeding or signs of preterm labor you should problem solve your individual situation with your caregiver depending on your individual situation and feelings you may decide that continued breastfeeding reduced breastfeeding or weaning is for the best there is no evidence that a well nourished mother who nurses during pregnancy is at risk nutritionally breastfeeding does not increase a mother's risk for osteoporosis even when the mother nurses during pregnancy http kellymom com nursingtwo faq safety html will nursing affect the nutrition of my unborn child this concern is valid for malnourished mothers but it does not appear to be grounded for well nourished mothers although we do not yet have a medical study that can speak directly to the question for well nourished mothers we have two reasons to be quite encouraged a survey of mothers who had breastfed during some or all of pregnancy recorded that the babies born to these mothers had healthy birth weights birth weights averaged lb oz and ranged from lb oz lbs oz moscone a recent review of the available research on breastfeeding and pregnancy as separate events revealed that as long as the mother is eating enough calories of a basic mixed diet and as long as she is gaining weight within healthy parameters there is ample reason to believe she can provide well for herself her fetus and her nursling adventures in tandem nursing http kellymom com nursingtwo faq fetalnutrition html  Premature birth Folic acid Obstetrics Abortion Abortion debate Coeliac disease Miscarriage Tocopherol Fertility awareness Cephalic disorder Milk Abortion in the United States Birth weight In vitro fertilisation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fetus Guinea pig Atkins Nutritional Approach Obesity Birth control Twin Prolactinoma Stomach cancer Prostate cancer Clinical depression Dieting Cancer Intact dilation and extraction Urinary incontinence Tobacco smoking Breech birth Medicine Prenatal diagnosis AIDS Cytomegalovirus Oral contraceptive Haloperidol Placenta praevia Partial-birth abortion Hypertension Multiple sclerosis Omega-3 fatty acid Caesarean section Alternative medicine Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Medical analysis of circumcision Stroke Postpartum depression Infantilism Hypoglycemia Adjustable gastric band Roe v.

my month baby girl never laughs or looks at people in the face is that normal she does smile all the time though i am used to boys i have three sons but they never acted this way she just never laughs or looks at me in the eyes i am a little concerned mabe it is just her personality i don't know i know she can hear and she can see but she has not laughed once since birth she may not know how to laugh yet most babies learn how to laugh at around months she could just be a little behind in developing laughter i wouldn't be too concerned and as far as the eye contact thing goes not all babies make eye contact could be a shyness issue i know shy people tend to shy away from making eye contact maybe she is shy she is probably just a shy slow verbal developer i think she'll turn out to be perfectly fine however you could always take her to her pediatrician for the reassurance blindness or deafness could be an issue but i doubt it a lot of people are saying autism autistic children don't make eye contact show emotion or talk until they receive proper therapy that is however your baby is too young to be diagnosed with autism that is usually diagnosed in a child's toddler years doctors usually don't know before then you did say though that your child smiles that's showing emotion so you could probably rule out autism now so yeah could be deaf if she responds to your voice then she is not deaf could be blind if you put a toy in front of her and she reaches for it then she is not blind could be shy someone said babies that young are not shy but they most certainly can be and that's probably all that is wrong with your precious cherub  Autism Autism rights movement Social rule Asperger syndrome Autistic community Ethical challenges to autism treatment Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hearing impairment Autism epidemic Hall & Oates Jon Secada Humphrey Bogart Neurodiversity Joke Autistic culture Teletubbies Shaggy dog story Gifted Dyslexia Childbirth Stuttering Human sexual behavior Daredevil The Ashlee Simpson Show Abortion debate Deaf culture Bernard Rimland Autistic spectrum Shyness Autistic savant Drama Eye contact Theodicy Sharon Tate Pervasive developmental disorder Political correctness Traumatic incident reduction Body language Rugrats Friends Terri Schiavo Controversies about functioning labels in the autism spectrum She Loves You Facilitated communication Sensory Integration Dysfunction The Flintstones EastEnders Aphasia Slow Train Coming Super Mario 128 Little Britain Time Out of Mind Pregnancy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Thimerosal Laughter Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Donald Rumsfeld Book of Isaiah Empire Burlesque Rain Man Eugenics Helen Keller Cochlear implant Daryl Hall American Sign Language Pedophilia Cephalic disorder Kodocha Hip hop collaborations Spidey Super Stories The Beach Boys AFI 100 Years series Neighbours Rais massacre Domestic violence Autistic enterocolitis Plame affair Cliff Richard Boom Town (Doctor Who) Transsexuality Glen Jacobs Good Morning, Vietnam Sant Thakar Singh Father's Day (Doctor Who) Prostate cancer Marilyn Monroe American Psycho I Am Furious Yellow Andrew Dice Clay Theory of mind Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Rush Limbaugh

how do you get a baby to accept milk from a sippy cup i've got a month daughter the sweetest thing who has been entirely breastfed so far i'm going back to work starting september so i need to get her to take her milk from something other than my breast in the past i've tried to get her to accept a bottle but it's been impossible she's been using a sippy cup to drink water for about months now and seems very happy with it the only thing is when i try to give her breast milk from the cup she takes a sip realizes what she's getting and starts crying she'll take the milk from the breast just fine so it's not that she doesn't like it she nurses in the morning when she wakes up once late morning am once in the afternoon pm and then before bed i'll still breastfeed her early morning and evening until she's about unless she doesn't want it any longer but i have to do something about the meals over the day when she's at the babysitter's what do i do thanks a lot just wanted to add that she is already on solids has meals a day is there any way i could skip the milk over day and maybe nurse her again as soon as we get back also i've tried formula too but she hated it it seems more like she wants the breast not that she doesn't like the cup or the milk keep trying have the sitter give it to her when you are out of site try lots of different cups and bottles she is old enough to start on solids you should only introduce one new food every few days to make sure there is no allergy talk to her pediatrician he should be able to give you more advice nurse her as often as you can but since you are giving solid foods she should be fine keep pumping and i would go ahead and offer her the sippy cup with your milk and if she takes it good if not it shouldn't hurt her as long as she is not losing weight and she continues to grow i wouldn't worry but if it worries you talk to her pediatrician  Breastfeeding Milk Tea Baby bottle Infant formula EastEnders Fiddler on the Roof Insomnia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Fertility awareness Dairy Avenue Q Nestl__ Social rule Knots Landing Indianapolis 500 Kodocha Breakfast Coffee Piccolo Junior Saga Infant The Super Milk-chan Show Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Brassiere Hong Kong-style milk tea 613 mitzvot Good Morning, Vietnam International response to Hurricane Katrina The Lovely Bones Nestl__ boycott Kibbutz Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Ron and Fez Breast milk Happy Meal Fasting Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Meal The Shining (film) Allergy Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Conker's Bad Fur Day Yom Kippur Brewery Characters in the Smurfs Cheese Cha chaan teng Breast pump Humphrey Bogart International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes The Human Stain RuneScape quests Jon Secada Nipple Friends About a Boy Pitaten Battle of Chancellorsville 2000 Australian Grand Prix Theory of conduct Kitchen The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Hera Singlish Marilyn Monroe Rice pudding MRE Calvin and Hobbes Milkshake Folic acid Futurama (TV series - season 4) Gastroesophageal reflux disease Jewish holiday Elephant Tocopherol Dawson's Creek Casting Phil Hendrie Great Teacher Onizuka Ty Cobb Norway national football team Chocolate Tofu Anderson Cooper Nipple piercing Oh My Goddess!

how do i make our relationship work any opinions on this matter i'm he is we have a month old little boy his farther works hours a week and pays for everything so he states i'm supposed to do everything with the baby he's changed diapers since birth and feeds him maybe once a week if i need to go to the bathroom or something i was put on zoloft a month ago but stopped taking it everytime we fight he tells me go take your medicine he wants me to take it so i'm happy and jolly all the time and do whatever he wants me to he still would rather go out than spend time with his family he's always mad at something something's always wrong in his life very negative he doesnt care about me either i would cry myself to sleep and he'd roll over and pass out i askeed him for help i've tried to talk to him he won't listen he's very hardheaded he says he doesnt want us to leave when i ask but when i suggest i will tomorrow not a peep out of him i want to make it work but should i just give up already why put all your energy into a man that obviously doesn't care and when you live with someone as a married couple the money becomes a shared asset i would make him leave and then if he is willing go to counseling unfortunately babies place huge stresses on a relationship i don't know about zoloft but from the sounds of it you are depressed and he is not making life better for you you need to get some support from your family and friends and you need to find inner happiness i am sorry if your relationship fails but best if its now before the child gets bigger and by the way you are doing a great job good luck and best wishes  EastEnders Divorce Knots Landing Kodocha Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Clinical depression Humphrey Bogart Pitaten Piccolo Junior Saga Shaggy dog story W.I.T.C.H.

parent's choice vs enfamil baby formula is there a difference between these two and how did you come to this conclusion there are not really any differences i use parents choice and if you look on the back of the can it tells the difference between it and the name brand formula there are only a few differences and they are not big ones like the other people said there are standards that formula has to meet in order to be able to be sold another difference is that parents choice doesnt offer coupons or free samples of course because the formula is so much cheaper than the others the only real difference if the price  Bond Rational pricing Microeconomics Belief revision New Coke Sales promotion Gross domestic product Formula 3000 Filling station Option style Probability Mutual fund Reverse mathematics Arbitrage Day trading Airline G__del's incompleteness theorem GED Mercedes-Benz Breastfeeding Sing Tao Daily Radeon Vector (spatial) MP3 Electronic commerce Nyquist___Shannon sampling theorem Second-order logic Oxford English Dictionary Formula Two Blockbuster Video Pepsi-Cola Property (ownership right) Laserdisc ELO rating system Axiom of choice Ford Motor Company Margin of error Non-standard analysis Linspire Inflation Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Credit derivative Insurance Quantification Jennifer Lopez Euro Intuitionistic logic Abortion in the United States EastEnders Standard deviation Monopoly Sears Holdings Corporation Single certification Divorce Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Free trade Prenatal diagnosis Economic inequality IPod Gravitational radiation Contax Gresham's law Biodiesel Economic calculation problem Black-Scholes Charter school Bicycle lighting Second language acquisition Power Rangers: SPD Nintendo Economics Infant Privatization MMORPG Gravis Ultrasound Franchising Atomic Kitten Digital photography Apple Computer Wal-Mart Education in the United States Tesco Kalman filter Inca Kola Education in Portugal Law of value OpenDocument Atari ST Transformation problem Education in Germany Ayrton Senna Annuity Complex number Infant formula Education in Romania Modified discrete cosine transform The Apprentice 2

most frustrating baby day so far any ideas my wife and i just had a baby boy who is weeks old and he normally is very quiet and has always eaten very well today is the first day that he has cried pretty much the whole time he has been awake he isn't sleeping very well today either any parents ever have a kid that can do a complete change in the way they act i e from laughter to screaming we have tried everthing from holding him the vibrating chair swing cuddling feeding but nothing is working today is it possible that it is just belly cramps or gas please help thanks well first thing i would do is put yourself in his little booties imagine you are uncomfortable but you are not sure what is wrong you can't communicate except to voice your frustration with your delima the only way you know how with a loud wail you persist in your wail hoping that someone hears you and fixes what is wrong daddy changes you nope thats not it mommy feeds you nope thats not it both mommy and daddy try to burp you nope i know it can be enormously frustrating to you but think about how he is the only way his needs are met is by someone else guessing at what his needs are the poor little thing cannot even turn over to get more comfortable he is just beginning to notice the little hands attached to him but can't use them yet i am so glad i do not remember being a baby it has to be extreemly frustrating and a confusing time but to solve your problem at that age he should not really have established a routine yet at first my week old was taking a nap during the day about am to pm not anymore now it seems the only way i can get him to sleep is if i take him for a long walk somedays he likes the swing but lately he hates it sometimes he has really good days where he can be coaxed to smile to where he looks like he is laughing from moring to evening othertimes evenings are hell he has to be on the boob all day i would not count on having the good fortune of a set rountine anytime soon i would chalk it up to gas and or a growth spurt for gas you can do two things if traditional burping doesn't work you can lay him on his back and push his legs lightly to his chest and count to ten do this times also you can massage his little belly and try to break it up it you feel that might be it you can also try to give him gas drops growth spurt just feed him more if you are breastfeeding let him finish on his terms for formula make a few ounces more and let him drink what he wants babies have an innate ability to eat to fulfill their needs and not more do not make him finish the bottle however today my now week old has been eating every hour  Breastfeeding Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Social rule Sin City The Shining (film) Aerial (dance move) Kodocha Jon Secada Poker jargon Friends Hansel und Gretel Milton H.

would it be possible to breastfeed even though i have to travel for my job when i return to work full time i will have to travel about once or twice a month for about two nights each trip is it possible to pump while i am traveling how do i store two days worth of breastmilk if i am staying in a hotel i want to make breastfeeding work and am looking forward to hearing from those of you who have had a similar experience i stay at home so i haven't personally had the experience i was reading about a woman who is in the army and breastfed her baby she had to travel out of state for a school common in the military and could last several weeks or months when her baby was very young she got a good hospital grade pump pumped on a schedule and kept the milk in a mini freezer she had bought to keep in the barracks with her you would probably have to make sure the freezer in the hotel is cold enough then she had the milk shipped back to her husband through a refrigerated shipping company i thought that was incredibly dedicated of her to go through all of that and i was really impressed the biggest concern i would have is that the fridge in the hotel room is cold enough you could also invest in a good cooler both to store the milk and travel home with it a third option would be to try to bank enough milk at home for the days you are gone and pump just to keep up your supply while away it can be done but it will take a lot of work on your part good luck  Breastfeeding Refrigerator Milk Fertility awareness Breast pump Dairy Childbirth Vacuum Ice cream Breast USS Vestal (AR-4) International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Breast milk Rais massacre Infant formula Internet fraud Nestl__ boycott Hotel Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Solar power Sears Holdings Corporation Refrigerator car EastEnders Jaundice Air conditioning Carburetor Breakfast Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Food storage Neighbours Ocean's Twelve Nestl__ Battles of Lexington and Concord Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Baby bottle Basement Cruising (maritime) Las Vegas metropolitan area Sharon Stone Bodybuilding In-N-Out Burger Kodocha Pregnancy Fancy Crane Attack on Pearl Harbor Make money fast Kitchen Operation Petticoat Joke Social rule Infant MapleStory Little Britain Tofu HMS Electra (H27) Coffee Francisco Pizarro Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Education in Germany Pitaten John F.

how can i get my month old to sleep through the night my son is now months old and he has never slept through the night he goes to bed at with no problem and only takes one minute nap a day he wakes up because he wants a bottle and will generally go back to sleep after he drinks it this happens times a night sometimes he is wide awake though and laughing and it takes forever to get him to sleep we talked to his doctor and he said that we feed him plenty during the day so there is no nutritional reason why he needs a bottle we have tried everything from rocking him to letting him cry it out and nothing works he recently has been standing up in his crib and shaking the bars and i am afraid he will hurt himself any advice as hard as it is you have to let him alone he has to know that when it is bed time its time to go to sleep you are the parent he doesn't need another feeding at night he just wants to be up and play but you need your rest too i didn't do this with my oldest he was almost before he quit trying to sleep with me and coming into my room at night so with my next one my husband and i vowed that we would break this bad sleep habit we only got him up at night until he was about months old then we let him go thru the night he didn't like it at first but once he realized we meant business he got over it kids are way smarter than we give them credit for they will push your buttons as soon as they can  Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breastfeeding Insomnia The Shining (film) Sin City Lisa's First Word The Catcher in the Rye Sleep Mattress Urinary incontinence Babe Ruth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Social rule Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Otello Phoebe Halliwell Ron and Fez Apollo 8 Pitaten Siesta Maison Ikkoku The Contender (television series) Milton H.

my month old breastfeed baby will not drink from a bottle help a baby who enjoys breastfeeding may not particularly welcome having milk from a bottle especially when his mother is available the first strategy could be to get other people to try your partner or your childminder for example while you absent yourself he may be happy doing things for other people he won't do with you you could try holding your baby in a different position to your usual breastfeeding one facing outwards for instance experiment with temperatures some babies will drink from a bottle at body temperature like breastmilk others prefer it cool or at room temperature try a variety of bottle teats and try softening them with warm boiled water if your baby really won't accept a bottle then it is possible to feed him with a spoon or a soft spouted beaker if he's around six months he might manage to drink from a cup some babies never bottle feed moving happily from breastfeeding to using a cup as part of the family meal don't forget that you can combine breastfeeding and working by feeding at nights early in the morning and at weekends if your working days are relatively short your baby might decide to hang on until you come home and then enjoy a good long feed generally speaking if you know you need to get your baby onto a bottle it's better to wait until breastfeeding is established but not leave it so long that your baby is unwilling to try anything new somewhere around six weeks after the birth is probably ideal many women who intend to return to work are understandably anxious about making sure their baby will take a bottle but try not to let the short time you have together be spoilt by fretting about this i hope this helps  Milk Baby bottle Fertility awareness Infant Dairy Childbirth Breakfast Coffee Customs and etiquette of Japan Comanche Pregnancy Breast milk Bong Humphrey Bogart Breast Breast pump Alcoholic beverage Infant formula Sake Social rule Shaggy dog story Japanese tea ceremony Nestl__ Nestl__ boycott International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Drink Hong Kong-style milk tea Poker jargon Inca Kola Alois Hitler Knots Landing Soft drink Fiddler on the Roof Breech birth Paradox Joke Water Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Catcher in the Rye Kodocha Rum Jon Secada Peruvian cuisine Ayyavazhi mythology Champagne (beverage) Fecal incontinence Plastic Spacecraft propulsion Hard water Friends Marilyn Monroe Nipple piercing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Phil Hendrie Elephant Platypus Indianapolis 500 Bass guitar The Apprentice 2 Katharine Hepburn Domestic goat Siphon Little Britain Eucharist Stanley Cup Dog EastEnders Coeliac disease Ocean's Twelve Cuisine of the Philippines Phoebe Buffay's songs Stone Cold Steve Austin Domestic rabbit Temperature Strap-on dildo Sea-Monkey Cider Roman eating and drinking Dairy farming Water (molecule) Cool (song) Prolactin Coca-Cola Guinea pig What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

neutral or all out boy girl we find out what we are having next friday hopefully anyways we plan on having another baby when this one is months old we were wondering if it is better to buy neutral stuff that way if one is a boy and the other a girl they can still use it what have you done i'm leaning more towards getting neutral stuff for most of it and then just a couple of either boy or girl stuff which ever the baby is as someone who went crazy with having everything pink when i found out we were having a girl i can honestly say i wish we would have gotten more neutral stuff i realized this when she only used some of the stuff for a month and thought what if we have a boy next time so my suggestion is if you are buying blankets for example buy one pink or blue whatever you are having and the rest white or neutral colors also what you can do is use the neutral stuff at home and save the pink or blue for when you go out  Max Martin Knots Landing Kate Vaiden Mr. and Mrs. Turner Phoebe Buffay's songs Timmy Turner Jon Secada Blood on the Tracks The Inside The Jeffersons (South Park) Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Neighbours Empire Burlesque Rainbow Brite Sin City Friends Vanessa Lynn Williams Anime Yoshi FLCL Great Teacher Onizuka Kurt Cobain Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cliff Richard Shaggy dog story Beatles for Sale Infantilism Kodocha Beavis and Butt-head Ron and Fez W.I.T.C.H.

changing pediatricians would you i am stuck my husband wants to keep our pediatrician but i do not why we always have more than one hour to wait on thursday we went for our well visit and the ped wasn't there yet we had the first appt at and she didn't see our baby until by then our baby was hungry it was past lunch for her and tired so i nursed her and the ped walked in and made a face like ohhh kkk annoyed i was covered but our baby was hungry and we had been waiting for hours our waits are always long if she were seeing another patient i would understand but she's not i think she is late because she is late getting to work she is the only doctor and runs her own practice she doesn't support breastfeeding at first it didn't bother me but now it does at our baby's first visit she handed us cans of formula and i never used them i was annoyed my husband likes her because she is laid back but i am fed up would you switch how do you switch peds our son was diagnosed with autism and her response autism is highly over diagnosed we had asked for a referral for years and didn't get one we finally went for a psych consult when our son was in kinder to see what was wrong and he was diagnosed around her but not with her help i am frustrated that he had all the signs and yet she refused to see them he has never ever uttered a word in her presence ever our baby just turned one and her response to nursing cut her off at the tap now i plan to nurse until she is months old i am a teacher and bring home every single germ disease known to man including whooping cough last year bronchitis etc our baby never got it do in part to her breastfeeding i don't believe in cutting them off not for the baby's comfort and not for mine either we wait at every appointment each time once was as long as hours actually eharra we spoke many times about the autism many she told us we were new parents and just worried too much he is now and has no fine motor control cannot tie his shoes or ride a bike he recieves ot pt speech socialization groups etc likewise i don't care what other people say about the breastfeeding do you breastfeed how would you know i know my year old has been sick once and has never had an ear infection she also has words and is ahead of herself in all areas spoiled child i think not we have discussed these issues with her her response i am the doctor you are not my husband is annoyed but doesn't want to switch as he doesn't want to hurt her feelings i could care less at this point ok before i address any of your specific concerns let me ask you this if this were a gardener who showed up late ignored what you said and generally didn't do what you thought was a good job would you put up with it or would you fire them if you ran a business and the accountant was always an hour late would you fire them if you went to your doctor and they gave you free samples of girl guide cookies or worse prozac or some other drug what would you think your health and your children's health is the most important thing and you shouldn't put up with a service provider who doesn't provide you with the level of service you desire handing out formula is one thing it is despicable and disgusting doctors should not be promoting any products at all ever but they always do but to not even be comfortable seeing breastfeeding you shouldn't be a pediatrician most breastfeeding babies use breastfeeding for comfort you are going to see breastfeeding during and after shots and any other upsetting procedure also autism treatments should always be started as soon as possible she looses nothing by giving you the referral you ask for and that fact that she still doesn't seem to believe not only you but other doctor s that just wouldn't sit well with me of course you should continue breastfeeding if i thought it would make any difference i would say you should shove the american academy of family physicians see below breastfeeding position paper in her face and the admittedly less well written american academy of pediatrics statement assuming you are american she should be a part of the aap but of course she doesn't have to listen to them sigh trust me you won't hurt her feelings she doesn't care about you and she won't notice that you are gone find a pediatrician that will work for you not against you and do it now before you end up with a situation that gets worse because she ignores it  Autism Shaggy dog story Asperger syndrome Medicine Childbirth Prostate cancer Humphrey Bogart EastEnders Theory of conduct Pediatrics Autism rights movement Milton H.

odd question if i have an reaction to a food can i pass it down to my baby while breastfeeding i tried a new salad last night a few minutes later i broke out in a itchy rash over my cheeks and neck my tonsils swell up it went away by its self in about hours i know i have a mild allergy to one of the herbs in the salad i didn't think to check the salad first however the weird thing is my month old baby came out with a rash a couple of hours later but i couldn't see his tonsils he was happy as i watched over him for awhile and he's fine the weird bit is that he's lost his rash like i did after hours it was worst just after his bath then just startded fading away so could i have passed the reaction down through my breastmilk it sounds like your baby has the same allergy as you you can't pass the reaction itself to him but he did inherit your allergy i would call his ped and let them know about the reaction he had and that your allergic to it as well so they can put it in his records  Allergy Breastfeeding Hay fever Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shaggy dog story Food Food allergy Peanut Tonsil Tattoo Coeliac disease Asthma Characters of Naruto Urticaria Rash Hypersensitivity Cat Multiple chemical sensitivity Infectious mononucleosis Conjunctivitis Angioedema Treehouse of Horror IX Humphrey Bogart Group A streptococcal infection Eczema First aid "Weird Al" Yankovic Latex allergy Vampire Childbirth Breast milk EastEnders Stuttering Insomnia The Star Wars Holiday Special Salad Fingers Hey Jude Time Out of Mind Cephalexin Nasal congestion Penicillin King Crimson Infant formula Salad Pittsburgh Steelers Airedale Terrier Elephant Whose Line Is It Anyway?

what made you decide to start your baby on solids how old were they and were they formula or breastfed just a sort of poll out of curiosity and interest i've just recently started my three month plus one week old son on rice cereal x per day he has reflux and the rice is supposed to help according to his pediatric gi so i feed him the cereal at his last feeding of the day i know some folks do this to make their babies sleep through the night for my son that is hit or miss depends on how well he napped how wet his diaper gets how alert he is when his daddy goes in for him sometimes he won't go back down in the middle of the night without a bottle even after his cereal meal but that was never our goal in the first place i should add that he hates his formula and he's a very big boy he is about pounds with good head and neck control those are criteria that i have read as a precursor to starting solids he won't have anything but the rice until the end of next month and i will only start introducing other foods if he is taking ounces of formula and still hungry  Breastfeeding Fertility awareness Infant Urinary incontinence Cereal Breakfast cereal Kimberly-Clark Corporation Sin City Agriculture Milk Diaper Scooby-Doo Breakfast Bowl Championship Series Cheese Rice University Billboard Hot 100 Rice Folic acid Bread Garfield Hamburger Nestl__ boycott Sean Combs Indianapolis 500 Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Camp Lazlo Gastroesophageal reflux disease Sleep Baby bottle Chess (musical) FoxTrot Infantilism Burger King Siesta Cleveland Indians Nestl__ Snooker Tupac Shakur Cliff Richard Futurama (TV series - season 5) Formula One Obesity Anopheles Vegeta Phoebe Buffay's songs Narcolepsy Ham Pet skunk Ron and Fez Laws of cricket Scott Storch EastEnders Provisioning (cruise ship) The Contender (television series) Cincinnati Bengals Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Rice Krispies Kibbutz Atkins Nutritional Approach Hypoglycemia Veganism Hamster Kosher foods Jon Secada Sumo Sake Hip hop rivalries Super Size Me Fasting National Football League Coeliac disease Lisa's First Word New York Giants Elimination communication Wheel of Fortune Shaggy dog story Vegetarianism Ayrton Senna Adjustable gastric band Alcoholic beverage $ale of the Century Parenting Kellogg Company MRE Plastic Cat Bodybuilding Phil Hendrie San Francisco 49ers Oat Fecal incontinence Shen Gong Wu Samples of music from the United States One Piece minor characters Kurt Angle Polish cuisine Rod Stewart

is this normal why does my four month old baby sometimes scrunch up his nose and make funny breathing noises he is so funny he'll huff and puff with his little nose scrunched up and take really fast deep breaths it's so random it doesn't seem to bother him i asked the doc and he said it's behavioral like when some babies make coughing noises just to hear themselves cough just wondering if any other moms out there have had or have babies that do the same thing thanks hugh a booger was my first thought too so i tried the nasal sucky thing no boogers lol sounds like he's a goon as long as he looks like he's able to breath fine and there isn't an obvious sound of mucus interfering with his breathing make fases back at him and enjoy it it sounds like your doctor has it right and he's playing with you to see what your reaction is i can garantee your face was probably pretty funny the first time you heard that and went running to see what was wrong  Mucus Shaggy dog story Joke Bart chalkboard gags Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Drag racing Milton H.

getting a breastfed baby to drink formula i have a month old who has been breastfed from day one i am going back to work and have to get her to take a bottle so i can put her in daycare i've tried giving her bottles numerous times and she just won't take it in fact she starts crying everytime she sees a bottle i've tried a few different types of nipples to no avail i had my mom and sister to try to give her bottles as well but she wouldn't take them either any suggestions i already feel awful for putting her in daycare but i have no choice please help serious answers only please also i can't pump i've tried hand pumps electric pumps and even rented one from the hospital none of them work so i have to give her formula please don't lecture on breastfeeding i already know and am proud to say my year old was breastfed until she was months old i don't need another reason to feel guilty right now i have already met with a lactation specialist and according to her it's not uncommon for women to not be able to pump with that said i am going to keep her on the breast for as long as possible whenever possible my son is in day care as well i have trouble pumping enough for him so he gets formula and breastmilk at day care when he is with me in the evenings and weekends he is strictly breastfed you said the pumps aren't working but i think maybe you could pump even if it's manually enough to keep your supply from drying up that way you can still nurse baby when you're with her my nursing time with my son is even more special to me now since i don't see him during the day that being said you can try the nd nature nipples that is the only one my son has ever used they have holes so they function like your nipple plus there are no stages so you don't have to worry about switching sizes baby controls the flow so there is less danger of overfeeding like with most nipples the baby has to actively suck or nothing comes out he uses avent bottles and i use an avent pump during the day so i don't have to worry about conversion there is also a bottle that is actually shaped like a breast and has a little nipple on it i can not think of the name but your lactation consultant should be able to tell you what it is that may help your little girl some other tips have someone else give her the bottle as you have already been trying also try the bottle when she is less likely to fight it for instance when she wakes at night she will be tired so she may just start sucking before she even realizes it is a bottle also she may not like the formula you have chosen my son would not drink enfamil gentle ease but he takes the regular enfamil lipil with iron with no problems talk to your pedi about this you could also consider buying breast milk from a reputable milk bank i have never tried this but i know it can be done the people at the day care probably have some experience with this type of situation so call them and see what they recommend your little girl may be completely different with them than she is with you and her auntie and grandmother just remember that any breast milk is better than no breast milk so keep nursing her whenever you can you can do this try not to stress yourself out and feel guilty you are doing the best that you can and it's obvious that you are a loving mommy you will find a way to work it out  Fertility awareness Nipple Nipple piercing Infant Childbirth Infant formula Milk Humphrey Bogart Social rule Prostate cancer Knots Landing Breast pump Urinary incontinence Friends About a Boy Infantilism Nestl__ Avenue Q EastEnders Prolactin Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Abortion Dairy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Catcher in the Rye Kodocha Indianapolis 500 Carburetor Breast cancer The Lovely Bones Conker's Bad Fur Day Little Britain Jon Secada Haloperidol Yoko Ono Thermal power station B-47 Stratojet Phoebe Buffay's songs Characters in the Smurfs AFI 100 Years series Hypoglycemia Androgen insensitivity syndrome Expert system American Psycho Ben Johnson (athlete) Transsexuality Breast milk Joke Fecal incontinence Oxytocin Mastitis Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Mattress The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Theory of conduct The Super Milk-chan Show Nestl__ boycott Ron and Fez Stuttering Frankie Laine Insulin Vitamin D The Shining (film) Breast fetishism The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Everwood The Human Stain Mammary gland Nudity Pok__mon Live!

cloth nappies opinions please am weeks preg and just wondering how good cloth nappies such as bambino mio are like the idea in principle but have heard mixed reports ie leaking x misspinkkitten has given you some excellent websites go check them out there are tons of nappies you can get and you don't have to buy all the same brand just like disposables different nappies suit different babies there are different fastenings fit rise absorbancy i started off with disposables and now am cloth i have loads of brands a colour and pattern for every outfit bulky ones slim fit ones i have a little girl and there's no need for fancy knickers under skirts and dresses when you have a funky all in one nappy or wrap we have tots bots bamboozles with which you need a seperate wrap and are reasonably slim fitting these are the most absorbant nappies i have go overnight easily and suit my baby's shape she's fairly slim and tall i have the aplix fastening they are available with different fasteners and several funky colours they come in two sizes which is up to about lb then which is about months to potty these take a long time to dry i also have some tots bots fluffles which are huge very big nappies i use a fleece wrap with these overnight fleece lets the botty breathe and the wetness evaporate through unlike plastic no good for under clothes but overnight really extends the nappy's absorbency there are pockets in fluffles which you can stuff with whatever material you like to increase wearing time these dry quickly and come in the same sizes as bamboozles never had a leak with these i have an babylove all in one nappy with has a built in liner and wrap it's easy to use but doesn't really suit my baby's shape which is why i only have one i have some wonderoos which are all in ones very funky colours very good nappies soft inner though take a while to dry these come in s m l some babies never need large popper fastening i have had a few leaks with these mainly because they are so very slim fitting but that also means they go under any outfit just like a disposable i have some motherease although i have heard tell that these are better for boys they are simple shaped cotton terry nappies with seperate wraps which are popper fastening at the side this is good for when your baby is older and tries to pull their nappy off these need changing more often than the tots bots i find but leaks are rare i have some cotton bottoms these like bambino mio are big squares of terry fabric that you simply fold into three and put between your baby's legs with a wrap over the top very simple a lot cheaper especially the birth to potty packs slim fitting round the sides some funky wraps out there the drawbacks are they need changing more often and are more prone to leakage especially solid leakage just because they don't go all round your baby you'll need to upsize these several times between birth and potty i have some happy hempys these dry fast but do stiffen up with repeated use pocket nappies very very absorbant need a seperate wrap three sizes s m l i have some cotton tots these are the funkiest nappies around pocket nappies all in one so you stuff them with whatever you need you can get these custom made with your choice of fleece colour for the inside and even the colour of the poppers very funky patterns indeed and very slim fitting absolutely fab for containing liquid stay dry as a bone when stuffed with a microfibre cloth three sizes s m l need changing more often as so slim fitting but very funky see i have too many to name seriously it is possible to get excited about nappies what i would do had i to start over i would get a set of newborn cotton bottoms or bambino mio along with a couple of size tots bots bamboozles and a wrap i'd use the cotton bottoms through the day on my new baby and the bamboozles at night then when he'she started to outgrow the newborn at about months i would start buying individual nappies one a week say to grow your collection and find which brand works best for you try looking on ebay there's a great selection of individual nappies on there and usually a lot of size ones and newborn size going cheap i get most of mine from there or if you're in the uk try the links below for some seriously good advice i really hope this helps you're always going to have a leak sometimes but if you find the nappies that work best for you and your little one you should be just fine try searching for your local council's website a lot of council run subsidies and will give you money back towards the startup cost of cloth or send you a free cloth nappy starter pack worth looking into even if you don't go for full time cloth in the end i wish you the best of luck and congratulations on your pregnancy

how to give prilosec to my weeks old and how long to see the result my daughter is weeks with silent reflux she was given zantac which didn't help so now she's on prilosec how can i give her the medicine can i mix it with milk anyone been in this situation can you help me and also how long will it take to see the results i'm really worried n worn out sorry for all this confusion i have already talked to her doctor i was only asking other mommies how to give it to her coz the doc said to give it by dropper syringe and she doesnt like it so i was wondering if i could mix it with her bottle and how long till i see the results anyone who has been through this would be helpful thanks i went through the same thing with my son first i would call the pharmicist and ask if they added any flavors to the medication with my son's meds they put it into a suspension and didn't add any flavors to mask the taste and trust me it tasted just like if i had chewed the pill itself if they didn't flavor it ask if they could and bring it in personal experience with my gremlin is bubble gum if it already flavored then the best way is to do it the same way as a pet unfortunately open her mouth and stick the syringe as far back into her mouth without choking her squirt it in and pinch her nose she will automatically swallow to clear her throat so she can breath miserable and she'll fight it but the benefits of the meds is more important good luck might also consider checking her out at the local childrens hospital gastro intestinal specialist my pediatrician tried to tell me my son was just refluxing and give him the meds it ended up that it wasn't reflux at all it was an allergy to his formula and he needed to be on a special formula with the proteins already broken down for him  Breastfeeding Gastroesophageal reflux disease Chewing gum Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Oral sex Asthma Traumatic brain injury Halitosis Medicine Tea Babe Ruth Coeliac disease Brewery Pneumonia Drowning Allergy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Gaia Online Adjustable gastric band Bread Garfield Happy Tree Friends Bubblegum Kodocha Beer 1957 World Series The Inside Tobacco Intravenous therapy Food allergy Cancer of the larynx Heartburn Coffee Ebola 2000 Australian Grand Prix Fancy rat One Piece minor characters Tobacco smoking Chronic fatigue syndrome Hypoglycemia Shaggy dog story Common cold Cuisine of Denmark Milton H.

did you ever get your life back after having a baby my son is months he seems to be getting easier to take care of i know his cries he's more predictable and more social hopefully soon he'll be holding his own bottle crawling and entartaining himself i know our lives won't be the same as they were before but after st year does it get easier caring for your child do you get back some of the freedom of doing things hhaha sorrry this question bugs you but you also didnt read into it does it sound like i hate my life with you giving me advice on pretty much not asking this it does get easier as far as the physical act of caring for children the diapers get less they do hold their bottles and eat 'table' food themselves and when they're mobile it opens up a whole host of problems but makes it easier too so it really doesn't get 'easier' or 'harder' in my opinion just constantly different once you're not changing diapers anymore you're cleaning up bedwetting accidents once you're not holding the bottle anymore you're picking up bottles and everything else that were thrown across the room once you don't have to carry them everywhere they're running off all the time once you can communicate with them and ask what they want they also start to yell at you every stage hell every day has it's own independent challenges it seems you do get a life back but like you said never the one you had before but i've found the older my kids get and mos the more normal it seems our lives have adapted to having little ones in it but we still get our own time back now too sometimes  Infantilism Urinary incontinence Fecal incontinence Surveillance Breastfeeding Kimberly-Clark Corporation Kitchen Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Diaper Kodocha The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Fairly OddParents The Amber Spyglass Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Avenue Q The Apprentice 2 Jon Secada The Contender (television series) RuneScape quests Theory of conduct Scenes from a Memory Professional wrestling match types Aerial (dance move) Elimination communication Trailer Park Boys Poker jargon Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?

how do you get a five week old infant on a schedule my five week old daughter has both feeding and sleeping issues the past couple of days she seems to get hungry crying hungry after hrs instead of that's with at the doctor's instructions after feeding her for solid active minutes at each breast i have continued to feel like my milk just does not sustain her prior to the past couple of days she'd have feeding marathons where i'd nurse for an hour and a half the doctor told me basically to stop being a human pacifier the doctor also seems to think my daughter really should be on a schedule now no more on demand feeding but at set times each day you can't really do that with a hour schedule any advice her sleeping issues are that basically she doesn't unless you are holding her or she has been supplemented sometimes oz sometimes a bit less than oz with formula i am not comfortable with co sleeping but it seems letting her sleep on my or my husband's chest is the only way we can get any rest help interestingly i called a lactation specialist and they suggested i call my pediatrician which is why i did that i'll be calling them back today too but others' experience and suggestions may be helpful during the day we can't put her down for a nap she cries to be held she will sleep in your arms where baby wearing goes she doesn't like the sling and i can get away with front pack once in a while most times she just cries and roots at this age she won't be on any kind of schedule i know it may seem like they should be but you could try and probably not get any results until they are around months old schedules just frustrate you more if you are breast feeding you should feed on demand especially right now since she is having a growth spurt right now and her feeding more frequently is going to increase your milk supply so she will have enough to eat after she grows she is just going to be much hungrier than usual because her body is working extra hard they ususally hit growth spurts close to weeks at weeks months and months i can't remember the last one but i think it was or maybe as for sleeping we had the same problem he would only sleep with me i just waited and at months he was comfortable being in his own bed you do what feels right for you and your family good luck and congrats on the baby girl edit oh yea i agree that you might want to change doctors to one that is going to promote breast feeding it sounds like this doctor either doesn't support it or doesn't know enough about it also you can consult with a lactation consultant and they really really help la leche league has a website too that is very informational just so you know too try not to supplement and just put her to the breast more often right now so that you don't accidently decrease your supply  Fertility awareness Urinary incontinence Breast Prostate cancer Sleep Puberty Milk Folic acid Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Equine conformation Infant Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Amazing Race Cat The Contender (television series) Guinea pig Fecal incontinence Saturday Night Live Tocopherol Brassiere Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Friends The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Dairy Little Britain Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Milton H.

what are the effects of lead paint on babies why is it dangerous it's common knowledge that there are strict regulations about lead paint and babies i was just wondering though what effect does lead paint have on babies what is lead poisoning lead poisoning occurs when you absorb too much lead by breathing or swallowing a substance with lead in it such as food dust paint or water too much lead in the body can cause irreversible problems in growth and development in children including behavior problems hearing problems learning problems slowed growth in adults lead poisoning can cause serious health problems including high blood pressure and damage to the brain nervous system stomach and kidneys although it is not normal to have lead in your body a small amount is present in most people lead can damage almost every organ system with the most harm caused to the brain nervous system kidneys and blood what causes lead poisoning lead poisoning is usually caused by months or years of exposure to small amounts of lead in the home work or day care environment it can also happen very quickly with exposure to high concentrations the most common source of lead exposure for children is lead based paint and dust and soil that are contaminated by it especially in older homes and buildings some estimates say that as many as three quarters of dwellings built before have indoor surfaces painted with lead containing paint adults are most often exposed to lead in the workplace or while doing hobbies those who work with lead such as metal smelters welders or pottery makers are at a higher risk of lead poisoning other sources of lead exposure include contaminated air including industrial emissions water and soil certain hobbies such as working with stained glass building lead based models reloading ammunition or shooting at indoor ranges some alternative medicines and supplements such as certain vitamins from india eating food or juice stored in cans made with lead or glazed with lead based glazes which are not manufactured in the united states most people are exposed to some amount of lead in their lifetime although environmental regulations have reduced lead exposure in the united states it is still a significant health risk especially for young children it is estimated that lead poisoning affects over children in the u s what are the symptoms there may be no noticeable symptoms of lead poisoning because the effects are subtle or may mimic other conditions when lead poisoning levels are severe some general symptoms can include digestive problems fatigue headaches and higher rates of tooth decay children with chronic lead poisoning may show slightly lower intelligence and may be smaller in size than children their age who do not have lead poisoning behavioral problems can include irritability or aggressiveness hyperactivity learning difficulties lethargy and loss of appetite in adults behavioral symptoms can include irritability mood and personality changes changes in sleep patterns difficulty concentrating and memory loss at high levels lead can affect the central nervous system leading to poor coordination weakness in hands and feet headaches and in severe cases convulsions paralysis and coma  Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Sewage treatment Methamphetamine Hydrogen sulfide Tobacco smoking Uranium Poliomyelitis Ionizing radiation Leukemia Welding 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Autoimmune diseases Dioxin Nuclear fallout Paracetamol Foodborne illness Beryllium Tocopherol First aid Bipolar disorder Botulism Insulin Multiple chemical sensitivity Air pollution Alcoholism Vitamin D Common cold DDT Dieting Clomipramine Cocaine Carbon dioxide Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Parkinson's disease Autism Nuclear power Chlorpromazine Dialysis Sleep Hamster Depleted uranium Anemia Polychlorinated biphenyl Lung cancer Stomach cancer Atkins Nutritional Approach Puberty Mobile phone radiation and health Lead poisoning Chernobyl accident Omega-3 fatty acid Cyanide Prostate cancer Cannabis (drug) Stuttering Epilepsy Growth hormone treatment Lead Mesothelioma Fibromyalgia Schizophrenia Migraine Vomiting Drowning Post-traumatic stress disorder Apoplexy Caffeine Mercury(II) chloride Malaria Hearing impairment Diarrhea

m old son sticking fingers in throat often my son is m i'm pretty sure he has acid reflux is it normal for a formula fed child of his age to still spit up often he does eat table foods and baby foods also he goes to the allgergist on the th with me he is on isomil advance because he was allergic to the regular milk based formula he doesn't drink cow's milk yet i'm wondering if he's sticking his fingers in his throat because of the reflux or if it's for some other reason i called the dr office yesterday and the nurse said that it's probably just a behavior but it could also be from his tummy bothering him cuz of the reflux she also said to avoid citrus foods if anyone has any suggestions on what we can do for him or to stop him until he sees the allergist i would appreciate it he isn't being treated for the relfux currrently but i'm hoping that the allergist will do so he does this to the point of gagging and choking if you pull his hand out he sticks it right back in what to do my daughter went through two stages where she did that she would put her fingers into her mouth and gag herself often to the point of vomitting for her it was just a behavior we ignored it and she eventually stopped when my husband used to react she thought it was funny and kept doing it  Breastfeeding Gastroesophageal reflux disease Urinary incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Salad Fingers Heartburn Elephant Joke Gag (BDSM) Drawn Together Dairy Food allergy The Marshall Mathers LP Coeliac disease Kodocha Milton H.

baby scratching her face my ten week old daughter has gained control of her hands and is now fascinated by her ability to put her hands to her bottle suck on her fingers and unfortunately scratch her face she scratched her face on two occasions today and drew blood there wasn't much bleeding but the scratches were about half an inch each and it broke my heart to see her bleed and cry i have the mittens and they worked wonderfully when she was fresh out of the womb but now she can wiggle out of them even a nicer pair i have that goes up higher on her arm i am wondering if any other parents found another solution for this problem i am very worried that she will scratch her eyes or cause more painful sores on her beautiful face what can i do to prevent scratching what can i put on her scratches thank you so much for your answers i swaddle her snugly at night so that is the one time i don't have to worry about scratches i will try your suggestions such as newborn socks leaving the scratches alone and i will be religious about keeping her nails trimmed i appreciate the feedback first off she wouldn't be the first to do this i would suggest keep doing the mittens even if she is pulling them off or try socks sometimes they stay on better make sure you are swaddling her when she is in her bouncer car seat laying down in your arms etc so that she doesn't have the chance to scratch i would also suggest trimming her fingernails as often as you can so they are too short for her to stratch herself if you are having troubles doing this may i suggest either doing it while bathing towards the end since they will be softer or if all else fails because of wiggles do it when they are sleeping i also suggest that they are usually looking for something to do when they end up scratching themselves so try to keep them preoccupied with sometihg in thier hands so they don't think about touching thier face tripe antibiotic neosporin should work fine for the scratches  Breastfeeding Knots Landing Piccolo Junior Saga Childbirth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Poker jargon Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Traumatic brain injury Vampire Social rule Knife EastEnders Salad Fingers Electrophysiology Avenue Q The Shining (film) Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Miscarriage Eczema Kodocha Time Out of Mind Jon Secada Stroke Blood on the Tracks Dialysis Menstrual cup Aerial (dance move) The Marshall Mathers LP W.I.T.C.H.

what could be the cause my son who is almost months has been routinely sleeping through the night with one feeding around am for the past two months the past couple of nights he has been waking up at least times to feed and getting up earlier than he normally would to eat i am thinking this is more of an eating issue than a sleeping one i was having a hard time with him napping lately but that is getting better while his night time is getting worse i don't put him down for late naps and getting him to sleep is not the issue he just keeps waking to eat he eats a lot during the day too so i am not putting him down hungry he eats the upper limit of what he should be ounces of formula if not more do you think it's just a growth spurt we are going in for his checkup next week and i will discuss this with the doc then but any other ideas of this sudden change in sleeping eating habits please do not tell me to put cereal into his bottle it is a choking hazard and is not proven to make them sleep longer when he is ready for it i will give it to him on a spoon the way he is suppose to eat it my best guess is that it is a growth spurt our twins did this too ask your doc about starting cereal sooner rather than later most docs recommend waiting until five or even six months before giving cereal especially if there is a history of allergies in the families i found with our guys that once we started cereal and then moved to baby food they drank less formula breast milk and slept better at night  Breakfast Infant formula Milk Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Siesta Characters in the Smurfs Puberty Garfield Narcolepsy Nestl__ Kosher foods Cat Folic acid Sea-Monkey Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fecal incontinence Allergy Sleep Atkins Nutritional Approach Friends Food Kurt Cobain Urinary incontinence Veganism Little Britain Futurama (TV series - season 5) Coeliac disease Ron and Fez EastEnders Knots Landing Slow Train Coming Fertility awareness Dieting One Piece minor characters Daylight saving time Saturday Night Live Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Password Infant Mattress Alcoholics Anonymous The Time Machine Days of our Lives Avenue Q Vegetarianism Capercaillie Asterix and the Laurel Wreath Vampire Dog Soybean Insomnia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fasting Livestock Tooth Apollo 8 Hera Peanut Binge eating disorder FoxTrot Sin City Baby bottle Social rule The Shining (film) Hansel und Gretel Roman eating and drinking Caffeine Childbirth Back to the Future Doraemon Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Conker's Bad Fur Day Jennifer Parker MRE Scooby-Doo Fiddler on the Roof Treehouse of Horror XII Jewish cuisine Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Ben Johnson (athlete) GED Salad Fingers Coffee Shaggy dog story Koala Breast cancer Marathon (sport) Drawn Together Bread Humphrey Bogart IP (complexity) Hypoglycemia Phoebe Buffay's songs AFI 100 Years series Russian cuisine

bright red blood after giving birth a month ago i gave a month ago and had an episiotomy my discharge has already turned from red to brown and then to yellowish but this morning it turned bright red again just like fresh blood my stiches has already healed so it is most probably from my uterus is this normal i stopped breast feeding two weeks ago and i felt some cramps this morning hmm it could be a number of things if your last lot of bleeding had completely stopped it could actually be your first period which sucks but can happen and more likely if youre no longer breastfeeding if you suddenly became more active as that can cause red blood it could be an infection here you have to just go by how you feel if you feel great the discharge isnt offensive and you dont have cramping then its probably not an infection but if its any of the above or you also have a temperature then i would ring your midwife just to be sure goodluck and congrats on the birth of your bubba  Childbirth Breastfeeding Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness First aid Pregnancy Obstetrics Miscarriage Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jaundice Puberty Stomach cancer Vitamin C Urinary incontinence Infant Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Female genital cutting Endometrial cancer Tuberculosis Dialysis Blood on the Tracks Endometriosis Breech birth Guinea pig Treehouse of Horror V Breast Blood Infant formula Caesarean section Gonorrhoea Shark Stroke AIDS Thermoregulation Tocopherol Oral contraceptive Psoriasis Androgen insensitivity syndrome EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Heartworm Muscle Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Abortion Kain (Legacy of Kain) Shaggy dog story Variable star Folic acid Bruise Bone marrow transplant HIV Collectibles in Bionicle Wound Time Out of Mind Group A streptococcal infection Complete blood count Platelet Milk Bleeding Leukemia Good Morning, Vietnam Discus (fish) Intravenous therapy Giraffe Infectious mononucleosis Dead Sea Slayers Old wives' tale Cancer Chlorpromazine Coeliac disease Blood (computer game) Placenta praevia Erythropoietin Socrates Dobermann Cephalic disorder Head louse Medical analysis of circumcision Undead (Discworld) Intersex surgery Wound healing phases Prostate cancer Prolactin 2000 Australian Grand Prix Episiotomy Chicken Anopheles Glucocorticoid Piccolo Junior Saga Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Anemia Chagas disease Traumatic brain injury 28 Days Later Forrest Gump Weapons of Middle-earth Postnatal

going back to work questions input appreciated i have a darling month old daughter and due to financial pressure might have to return to work earlier than the year i was originally planning on like in the next month or so i don't want to pressure my family by having them look after her days a week so was thinking of sending her to child care or days a week and having my mum look after her the other days what should i look for in a child care how do i know they are going to look after my baby especially since she can't talk and tell me if anything is wrong did you leave your baby in childcare so young if so how did it go how did you cope based on personal experience what is the cost of good childcare a rough daily rate thanks in advance i know it is hard to leave your baby for the day but it makes it a lot easier if you know she is in the right hands the best infant care is designed to allow babies to discover their worlds naturally this means that you should see caregivers getting down on the floor with the babies but also allowing them tummy time and floor time while supervised when you go on visits ask not only the directors but the teachers about their philosophy if they are well educated and experienced they will have a more sophisticated answer than keeping the kids safe while they have fun watch out for daycares with too many swings bouncy seats and exersaucers while the children enjoy them if they have one for every baby they probably aren't getting held played with enough excellent childcares also have certified teachers even in their infant rooms also talk to parents who have sent their children there or are sending their children there i don't have children personally but i did go to school for early childhood education and i now am an infant teacher something to make things easier make sure your daughter is willing to drink out of a bottle whatever your preference for what she drinks is fine but one of the hardest things for infant teachers is when babies are only breastfed and don't know how to drink from bottles childcares' costs depend mostly on the area you live in i have worked in places that are a couple hundred a month week and even day in the end if you aren't comfortable leaving your baby there and you constantly worry that the caregivers aren't doing enough for her then it isn't the right place for you you should feel comfortable calling dropping by and visiting the room good luck and i hope this helps you  Breastfeeding Infantilism Social rule Humphrey Bogart About a Boy Childbirth Day care Adoption Theory of conduct Fertility awareness Pitaten EastEnders Abortion debate Transsexuality Kodocha Little Britain Childcare Child Care Bears Infant formula Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pregnancy Knots Landing Floppy disk Philosophical skepticism Unemployment Friends The Death Gate Cycle Parachuting The Catcher in the Rye Fathers' rights Urinary incontinence Abortion Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Parenting Attachment parenting Baby bottle Aerial (dance move) Full House Socrates Sudden infant death syndrome Kender Richard Feynman Shaggy dog story Paragliding Jon Secada Theodicy Melanie Wilkes Alcoholics Anonymous Fast bowling Early childhood education Education Phoebe Halliwell Postpartum depression Elimination communication Irish dance Sharon Tate Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Charmed The Adventures of Pete & Pete Extreme Programming Ethics The Fast Show Fecal incontinence Equine conformation Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder The Giver Sant Thakar Singh Domestic rabbit Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Autism Sesame Street Child sexuality Children of God Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Karen Horney Transactional analysis Bouncy techno The Apprentice 2 Infant Teenage pregnancy Kibbutz Mattress Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist RuneScape quests Laura Schlessinger Champagne (beverage) Peter Singer Baby transport Strap-on dildo Jean-Jacques Rousseau Education in the People's Republic of China God Emperor of Dune The Star Wars Holiday Special Hormone replacement therapy (trans)

people constantly staring at me breastfeed when i breastfeed in public even when i'm turned away from everyone there's always guys giving me the googly eyes trying to catch a glimpse of my nipple and i'm not exactly ugly or fat ha whats peoples fascination with it it's natural i don't sit there with my boobs hanging out and i cover up the best i can i also never do it in the presence of children if that happens i go to the car changing room in a store womens lounge in a resturaunt or store etc i'm not a hooker trying to expose myself but if it's degrees out i'm not going to suffocate my child with a big blanket and it will be a cold day in hell when i feed my son in a disgusting dirty germ infested bathroom stall what did some of you women do when this would does happen listen elton what i am doing is not sexual in the least it is feeding my child something that is needed for survival it's pigs like you who i'm talking about just because you can't have any of this doesn't mean you have to be bitter i look at breastfeeding women a smile from ear to ear i'm so happy for what they are doing for their baby i make sure they know i'm not staring and if i'm in a good place i'll go over and tell them how beautiful they look and that they should be really proud of what they are doing too many nursing mothers get evil eyes and open suggestions on what would make other people more comfortable like covering up etc you should however nurse infront of children they are the next generations and we want to stop this nursing stigmatism now but we can't the only way to help out is to show children including your own that nursing is a happy healthy and natural thing to do if our children don't learn from nursing mothers they will learn from mothers feeding their children by bottle obviously i'm not talking about people who couldn't breastfeed etc so no knickers in a knot who never have to cover up even though it isn't natural if someone was to look at me breastfeeding i think the best thing to do is look back at them with intense eyes and just smile if they continue to look you can ask them how their meal is or say lovely weather kill them with kindess as we don't want nursing mothers to become known as irate even though i'm sure you feel that way sometimes eye contact is very powerful use it  Breastfeeding Shaggy dog story Sin City Humphrey Bogart EastEnders The Shining (film) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breast Knots Landing Social rule Teen Girl Squad The Inside Childbirth YuYu Hakusho Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infant Fertility awareness Pitaten Little Britain Kodocha Recurring South Park characters The Amber Spyglass Comanche The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe True Crime: Streets of LA The Wall Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword The Smoking Room Brassiere Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Kyle Broflovski One Tree Hill (TV series) Characters of The Sandman Jon Secada Care Bears Human sexual behavior Marilyn Monroe Toilet humour Survivor (novel) Shark Garfield Laura Schlessinger What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

when does a baby stop being breast fed i'm not a mother but i saw an ad for baby formula and it got me thinking how old is a baby normally before they stop being breast fed most women who breastfeed do so exclusively for months after that some women aim to have their children weaned completely by the age of seems to be a north american cultural thing many women however choose to let the baby get to an older age where they are better able to understand language to make the weaning process easier i would imagine most of these women wean before years but it is not uncommon to go for or even years before weaning in which case the child often self weans it is all a matter of personal philosophy really many women want weaning to be as easy for the child as possible so they want to wait most women who wean before the age of do so on their terms not their child's  Breastfeeding Breast Infant Mastitis Childbirth Pregnancy Fertility awareness Breast milk Androgen insensitivity syndrome Abortion debate Prolactin Infant formula Protein-energy malnutrition Gurage Elimination communication Co-sleeping Nestl__ boycott International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Milk Women in Islam Premature birth Gender role Prolactinoma Breast cancer Breast pump Koala Human Abortion Sudden infant death syndrome Puberty Justification (theology) Haloperidol Social rule Baby bottle Kitten White (people) Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Childfree Parenting Goodness and value theory Science Infantilism Transsexuality Socrates Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Divorce Truth Blue Whale Jon Secada Jean-Jacques Rousseau Cytomegalovirus Adoption Given name Niddah Sexual orientation Free will Asperger syndrome Nipple piercing Talaq (Nikah) Ontological argument Family Gorilla Theory of conduct Abortion in the United States Miscarriage EastEnders Feminism Logic Pregnancy fetishism Person Brassiere Mental retardation Human cloning Jaundice African philosophy Obstetrics Stewie Griffin Eating Children of God Medical analysis of circumcision Mountain Gorilla Confucius Acorn Nudity Elephant Autism Domestic violence Cancer Cyberspace Carl Jung Mary Wollstonecraft Japanese name Mathematics In vitro fertilisation Ayyavazhi mythology Harp Seal Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Origin belief Paige Matthews

leaky boobs wake baby to feed my baby is days old and my boobs leak and get engorged quite a bit i breastfeed her about times per day but i was wondering if it is a bad move to wake her up to feed when i am leaking and in pain i use nursing pads but when i am engorged and she is asleep i wonder if it would be a bad idea to wake her up to feed her or if i should just let her sleep and feed her when she wakes up i don't want to get out my breast pump because i don't want to be dry for her and it is kindof a pain to get out and use it all the time you should also think about pumping and storing your breastmilk this will be a tremendous help for you when you have things to do perhaps your partner can feed her instead once in a while etc it is a misconception that you will be 'dried up' after pumping yes it might take an hour or so to be back to your normal milk levels but your body makes enough milk for what is being consumed whether its by your baby or by your pump your milk is liquid gold so i understand your concern if your boobs are very painful you might want to just try to express some milk in the shower make sure you look out for any masses or balls in your breasts massage them out so you don't get any blocked ducts or mastitis like i did its awful if you are in serious pain you could think about taking a regular tylenol to help ease the pain but things should really start to regulate themselves by weeks i know it sounds like ages away but if you can stick it out until then you're giving your baby the best start and it will only get easier for you if not at least you tried as for waking her really try not to wake her up she will get up when she's hungry usually every hours my son went hours one day and i freaked out no only was i in pain but i thought something was wrong with him they are fine and will let you know when they need more fuel you just need to figure out the best system to deal with all this milk in the meantime do your best to sleep i know its nearly impossible with your boobs feeling the way they do but it will pass soon enough good luck to you  Breast Urinary incontinence Childbirth Dairy Thermal power station Fecal incontinence Fertility awareness Breast pump Milton H.

what can i do to calm down my newborn with acid reflux try to keep him in an upright position as much as possible especially after feedings you could try feeding him half as much twice as often prop his sleeping surface up about degrees so his head is higher than his feet my son slept in his car seat for a long time but ask your doctor about it first you can try over the counter gas drops you can ask your doctor about getting a prescription acid reducer if you're feeding formula you could also ask about switching that frequent burping burp during feeding after each ounce or two that's what they say but honestly this did not work for my son he would quit eating as soon as he burped the first time you can try it it probably works for some you can try baby massage especially a tummy massage rub the stomach in a semi circle starting at the bottom right working up to the top and ending at the bottom left you can try pushing the legs up to the chest and then all the way back down to straight both at the same time and then alternate somewhat like a bicycle it seems to help relieve the gas i can't explain it the best maybe there's a website i'll edit if i can find one good luck they do grow out of it i hope you have lots of supportive people around i know how stressful it can be  Breastfeeding Burping Professional wrestling holds Equine conformation Aerial (dance move) Childbirth Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling aerial techniques Backstroke Massage Professional wrestling attacks Fire fighting Recumbent bicycle Mattress Urinary incontinence Stomach cancer Swingout Gastroesophageal reflux disease Breaststroke Siphon Diving Water (molecule) Drill bit Hypoglycemia Anatomical terms of location Internal ballistics Hair Clinical depression Breech birth Rugby union positions Suplex Front crawl Chair Bicycle Obesity Medical prescription Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Skateboarding trick Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Motor oil Bloat The Contender (television series) Textile manufacturing Insomnia Bicycle frame Comanche Piccolo Junior Saga Gas metal arc welding 2000 Australian Grand Prix Caffeine Thermal power station Fast bowling Cancer of the larynx Acne Four-stroke cycle Electric motor Care Bears Veganism Reflexology Butterfly stroke Poker jargon Cheese Omega-3 fatty acid 1957 World Series Cannabis (drug) Anxiety Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Suicide methods Fibromyalgia Shaggy dog story Manicure Cat Carpal tunnel syndrome Infant Flatulence Hydrogen peroxide Vampire Welding Fertility awareness 2004 World Series Alcohol fuel Coeliac disease First aid Naval mine Physical therapy Gray Wolf Eyeglass prescription Adjustable gastric band Asthma Aquatic ape hypothesis Swimming The Amazing Race Alcohol Cocaine Reflux Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Diving suit Counter Yarrow

how can i get my baby to eat more i have an month old baby i am pretty sure he is teething my question is how long will his decrease in appetite last he has been refusing solids for about a month now as soon as i put him in his high chair he cries and gets stiff so i wont put him down once i get him in he will only have one or two spoonfuls baby spoons and then he pushes the food away i'm starting to worry he breastfeeds about times in the day for about minutes and then he still feeds at night we co sleep i know he needs to eat solids now but how long will this last it never happened with my other kids help he had been eating solids since months and used to love them he would eat a stage baby food jar and sometimes even more he has always had his solids in his high chair so i dont think it is the chair itself i think its the association with food but why try feeding him on your lap also be sure to breastfeed him right before he eats so that's he's not super hungry this will allow him to think of food as a fun thing rather than what the heck is she doing i'm starving where's my nursies don't stress though as long as he is nursing well he is getting all he really needs at this point solids are more for practice than for nutrition he'll be interested in food eventually i promise  Breastfeeding Childbirth Fertility awareness Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infant Infant formula AFI 100 Years series Dieting Stomach cancer Milton H.

looking for supplemental nursing system sns for breastfeeding i want to restart breastfeeding my son is still able to latch on very well but stops after he gets almost nothing out pumping is not increasing my supply and i'm already on fenugreek i think a sns is our answer if you know where i can get one either second hand i have medela bags to sterilize or a cheap new one i would love to hear it i just don't have to spend on something that might not work for us i was told by someone that wic has them our wic office believe it or not isn't as much into breastfeeding as you would think my son just turned one and has been weaned since he was a little over months they will say he is over one so don't worry about breastfeeding him anymore my goal was months and still is hopefully with the sns we can make it to that thanks so much in advance wanted to add i'm bidding on one that is on ebay right now but you know how that goes the last few minutes they shoot up to almost full price i will try wic tomorrow you are right no harm in calling and i wanted to add he enjoys breastfeeding but being a busy toddler there is no time for him to sit down and nurse unless he is getting a good bit of milk that is why we stopped to begin with my supply was never what i would call great no matter what i tried so bottles became more and more each day until no more breastfeeding i really do hope people read this and understand that if you really do have to supplement then use the sns bottles are not the answer like you said if you want to keep breastfeeding and he will not comfort nurse i'm hoping that a few weeks of using the sns he will understand that nursing isn't just for food like he used to he takes a pacifier and that's his comfort he used to nurse for comfort and food but now he doesn't show that much of an interest unless he is getting milk great job for wanting to get back to breastfeeding have you tried la leche league's website they have a phone number and someone there might be able to help you also have you checked ebay since you are looking for a used sns or have you talked to your local hospital or lactation consultants our wic office is not that breastfeeding friendly either so i know what you mean there http www lalecheleague org http www kellymom com here's the search result for ebay there were several one was even new and going for plus shipping http search ebay com search search dll from r trksid m satitle supplemental nursing system category hmmm i'm really bummed to hear the reason you stopped in the first place i hope others read this and realize that you should not supplement at all if you are committed to breastfeeding that is not the answer to a low milk supply once you give that first supplemental bottle that is the beginning of the end of breastfeeding there are many things you can do to boost your milk supply if it really was low this is also a common misconception usually the child has just become more effecient at nursing rather than a drop in supply and pumping is never an indication of how much milk you have  Milk Childbirth Fertility awareness Infant formula Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dairy Folic acid Prostate cancer Live 8 Haven (TNG episode) Social rule Breast pump The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Kodocha Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Humphrey Bogart Breast Phoebe Halliwell Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Inside Little Britain Continuation War The Amber Spyglass Domain Name System Milton H.

need to know if i did it right my month old daughter has cradle cap i think it's yellow kinda looks scally on her head and i put baby oil in her hair waited five minutes then combed it out gentally but then her head started to turn red so i stopped and washed the baby oil out of her hair did i do this right is it normal for her hed to turn red the scally things are still there how long will it take for me to do this before its completely gone if you can help please that will be great and for the people that does answer me thank you when my son was a baby i was told that cradle cap was excess oil not over dry skin the scaling is due to too much oil on the scalp and the oils are what makes it yellow i talked with the pediatrician and here's what i did i used a soft moist baby wash cloth and rubbed gently in little cirlces little bits of the scaly stuff started to come up after a couple of sessions of this then once the scaly stuff started coming up it really was a snow storm of the slightly yellow flakes after that i kept an eye on it and when i saw some start i was on top of it so it didn't get all over his head again and actually the maintenance was a 'breeze' compared to getting that scale to loosen initially i was also told by a friend she bathed her baby more often and put lotion or baby all over but not on the head just pat it dry and it loosened up the cradle cap heres something from health link and a med college cradle cap q could you please tell me what cradle cap is and how to treat it a cradle cap is a benign condition of the scalp occurring in infants that involves scaling and some redness it generally is not a part of any illness syndrome and does not imply that a baby is not being well cared for the best way to treat the condition involves the daily use of a baby shampoo applied with a soft toothbrush to cleanse and loosen the scales if after a week or so there is no improvement and there are no other signs of illness your doctor may prescribe a medicated shampoo that is usually used for the treatment of a fungus keep in mind however that cradle cap is not an infection of any kind article created article updated  Psoriasis Dandruff Eczema Massage Breastfeeding Acne Pneumonia Stomach cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Sento Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Baldness treatments Cancer Medicine Epilepsy Scabies Migraine Herpes simplex virus Cephalic disorder Chronic fatigue syndrome Fecal incontinence Hair Radiation therapy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Baldness Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hypoglycemia Comanche Textile manufacturing AIDS Urinary incontinence Lupus erythematosus Fancy rat Vitamin D Otitis externa Diseases of the honeybee Father's Day (Doctor Who) Manicure Hearing impairment Dialysis Autism Multiple sclerosis Domestic rabbit Hair conditioner Publicly funded medicine Violin Ketoconazole Bipolar disorder Sleep apnea Phimosis Traumatic brain injury Thermal power station Stroke Tooth enamel Sudden infant death syndrome Homeopathy Hypertension Diabetes mellitus Escherichia coli O157:H7 Milton H.

rash on face my son cut his chin not enough to get stitches but he needs to keep a bandaid on it all day now he is developing a rash where the bandaid goes does anyone have advice on what to use or do to get rid of the rash well i use benadryl cream but it depends on how old the child is if they are under you should ask a doctor it could have been caused by things one being that he could have had a reaction to the adhesive on the bandaid and the second being that he could be allergic to latex which is what most bandaid are made of my son and i both have that problem and it can be fixed by buying latex free bandaid a little more expensive but less irritation also remember that the skin on the face is one of the easiest places to get irritated i hope this helps and i hope the rash clears up  Psoriasis Eczema Latex allergy Tattoo Allergy Fecal incontinence Rash Scabies Condom Hay fever Urinary incontinence Food allergy Coeliac disease Stomach cancer Multiple chemical sensitivity Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mattress Strap-on dildo Diaper Roseola Crohn's disease Tarantula Spina bifida Cephalexin Group A streptococcal infection Dexamethasone Urticaria Skin Sulfasalazine Urticating hair Corticosteroid Rubber Scar Methamphetamine Syphilis LaTeX Acne Shaving Infantilism Paracetamol Latex Menstrual cup Cellulitis Breastfeeding Aluminium Dairy Hypersensitivity Cat Dandruff Lupus erythematosus Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Waxing TeX Depilation Radiation therapy Internet troll Pointe shoes Callus Hydrogen peroxide Intravenous therapy Suture Amineptine Medical analysis of circumcision Irritable bowel syndrome Food Safe sex Measles Creosote Lyme disease Diarrhea Road Rash Vulcanization Gay bathhouse Chlorpromazine Polychlorinated biphenyl Ashton-Tate Cashew Lichen planus Cephalic disorder Menstrual cycle Mathematics Biotin Candidiasis Little Britain Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Pubic hair Theory of conduct Traumatic brain injury Cancer Chewing gum Paint Schistosoma mansoni Enzyme Casting Carpet Diving Yarrow The Caves of Androzani Prostate cancer Phimosis

swaddling our baby at night when to stop following the advice of our pediatrician we follow the karp method the s s for soothing our week old daughter to sleep it works very well for us but that's another story our pediatrician has assured us that it's fine to keep swaddling at night for limited periods i e night time sleep swaddling won't affect her development and that it's good to keep it up if it helps her sleep and stay calm also i know that around months babies usually stop needing enjoying the swaddle however we are just wondering when do others usually stop swaddling their babies why also if you have any tips on weaning them from the swaddle we'd love to hear them although a lot of literature i read said no to swaddling after one month of age my pediatrician said it was fine for me to continue it as long as my baby liked it and as long as it was only at night until she started getting more mobile and rolling over because of sids as soon as my little girl started trying to roll over i started the weaning process one arm out one arm in then both arms out still swaddling her torso then finally no blanket she loved being swaddled but i really had no trouble weaning her this way this was when she was around months old good luck  Breastfeeding Sudden infant death syndrome Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Girls Aloud The Beatles discography Urinary incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Aerial (dance move) Comanche The Contender (television series) EastEnders Avenue Q Cliff Richard Knots Landing Journey (band) 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Supremes Swingout Kodocha The Amber Spyglass Rod Stewart Anne Rice Public transport Continuation War Second Battle of the Atlantic Charmed Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Knife Insomnia Bringing It All Back Home The Rutles Negima Childbirth Sin City Sam Cooke Louie, Louie Sleeping Murder Beatles for Sale Pet skunk Eddie Guerrero Craps Grumpy's Three Wishes Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys Psoriasis Tupac Shakur Soap opera The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland The Curse of Fenric Sharon Tate Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Carl Barks Paige Matthews Frankie Laine Fire fighting Elvis and Me Anne Boleyn Equine conformation Donna Summer The Subtle Knife One-hit wonders in the UK Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Situation comedy Empire Burlesque Co-sleeping Michael Garibaldi The Time Machine Aphrodite AFI 100 Years series The Catcher in the Rye Jon Secada Static Shock Blankets (graphic novel) Big Brother UK series 6 The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Freddy Fender We Belong Together Jean Grey Days of our Lives Boxing W.I.T.C.H.

month old and sleep questions my th month old continues to wake every night i have tried everything from the ferber method to cold turkey and while i do not expect him to sleep through the night i need to some how find a way to break his waking every hour he has a mobile that i have used to distract him i have put him down awake and asleep if i respond quickly to his crying he'll grab my hand and go right back to sleep if i don't respond right away he wakes up and is harder to get back to sleep when i do go in he is sitting up and then wants to play and the only way he'll go back down is if i stand there bent over the crib with my hand on his stomach and since he is awake it takes a long time to get him to go back to sleep sometimes this goes on for hours in the middle of the night i have tried putting something that smells like me in crib he has a blanky he cuddles with but apparently nothing is as good as me i about to return to work and i can't be losing this much sleep every night any ideas he started solids at months and we are up to three solid feedings a day he is well fed and happy we have a bedtime routine and i have pushed him through a nap thinking that might help too i appreciate the advice everyone has given i guess i just need to know that other people have gone through this too and so far all the advice people have offered i have done so it makes me feel like i am doing all right i will check out the link to the book thank you first off the book no cry sleep solution helped us a ton http www pantley com elizabeth books php check it out a few more things that helped us moving bedtime up to pm it was much later a consistant bedtime routine starting at pm no tv or radio on during this time everything is kept quiet and non stimulating as we do bath pjs stories and finish with rocking in the rocking chair and lullibyes a lovey like your blanket i have him hold it when i'm nursing it and sometimes i'll wear it in my shirt so it smells like me i do a dream feed before i go to bed at pm i go in and nurse baby while he's half asleep to tank him up for a few more hours making sure he is napping enough during the day sleep begets sleep it took us awhile to figure that one out it sounds like you might be a good candiate for cosleeping if that is something you are open to it sounds like you would both get much more sleep that way and it would be a nice way to reconnect since you are going to be at work during the day we coslept for the first months and loved it it stopped working for us once ds got really moblie and we are both light sleepers transitioning him out was no big deal so don't be afraid that baby will be in bed with you forever he won't you could put baby to bed in his crib and once he wakes move him to your bed for the rest of the night good luck hope you get some sleep mama  Sleep Insomnia Mattress Shaggy dog story The Amber Spyglass Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Out-of-body experience Milton H.

letting my baby cry ok so i am starting this let my baby cry thing when she wakes up in the middle of the night what do i do go in there and give her her paci and lay her back down or don't go in at all this is the first night so i need lots of help please she is months old i guess the reason i am starting so late at this is because of my mom she says i shouldn't let her cry till she is huffing and puffing first off consider what this is going to do to you your family and your neighbors if you are living close to others i tried this out of the mistaken belief that some doctor who didn't even know my son's name without looking at a chart can tell me how to raise him well we tried for a month and all i got for it was an irate husband and neighbors calling cps for neglecting my son he would cry and scream some nights so badly he would puke everywhere i did the every minute thing and sit by the crib and everything they say to soothe and walk away and it didn't work he is now sleeps perfectly fine and despite what the critics of attachment parenting he is not a whiny needy clingy child he is head strong independant and spirited if he had his way i wouldn't get any cuddles or kisses at all but then he is a boy after all kudos for you if it works but don't be surprised if it doesn't babies need their mothers  Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders The Shining (film) Jon Secada Friends The Marshall Mathers LP Theory of conduct The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Humphrey Bogart About a Boy Cindy Sheehan Time Out of Mind Pitaten Milton H.

i'm confused about something i hear all of these people say that letting babies cry is cruel i think that it was the best way to teach my daughter how to sleep in her crib for the first couple nights i would give her a bath and then put her down in her crib and she would cry for about min and then she would fall asleep and sleep all night then after a couple of nights everytime i put her down she would always be awake but she would never cry and fall asleep all on her own she is months old now i don't understand why people are saying that it is mean and cruel i know letting your child cry is not easy it was awful for me but now she knows its bedtime and she knows that she is not going to have mommy running in and out because she is crying she knows that she has to go to sleep and she does does anybody agree with me or is it just me i don't need rude comments everybody raises there children differently so i really do not want to hear about what a bad mother i am for letting my baby cry there is a difference of what you are doing and just getting fed up and placing your child in a crib and not attending i think as long as you make sure that the baby is fine diaper fed etc and that they are truely tired let them cry all they are doing is fighting thier sleep now if it takes longer and they are still crying yes go in there and get them out and double check and try to put them to sleep another way crying out it is so funny it use to be something that was a big thing it was a parenting fad now jsut like everything else that was done when we were kids cruel blah blah blah i am sorry i look at my generation and the ones before and we didnt have all the crap going on in society everyday like we do now days oh gosh sorry i got on a rant lol you arent a bad mother you are a good mother just ignore it some of the ppl who comment about this things dont even have kiddos some of them are the if's  The Catcher in the Rye John the Baptist Social rule Phoebe Buffay's songs Sleep Breastfeeding Ayyavazhi mythology Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an AFI 100 Years series Infantilism Laura Schlessinger Sudden infant death syndrome Friends Urinary incontinence Little Britain Kill Bill Knots Landing What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

advice for a month old my daughter is supposidly starting teething according to my mother she says she can feel the tooth coming in but i can't feel anything my daughter does slobber alot and she is starting to bite instead of suck and she chews on everything i was wondering if people think she is teething and on another note is it normal for my daughter to suck on her index fingure instead of her thumb like normal babies teething can begin as early as months and continue until a child's third birthday typically between the ages of and months you will notice your child's first tooth pushing through the gum line the first teeth to appear are usually the two bottom front teeth also known as the central incisors these are usually followed to weeks later by the four front upper teeth central and lateral incisors about month later the lower lateral incisors the two teeth flanking the bottom front teeth will appear next to break through the gum line are the first molars the back teeth used for grinding food then finally the eyeteeth the pointy teeth in the upper jaw most children have all of their primary teeth by their third birthday this is a general rule if your child experiences significant delay speak to your child's doctor whenever your child begins teething you may notice that your child seems to drool more and seems to want to chew on things for some babies teething is painless others may experience brief periods of irritability and some may seem cranky for weeks experiencing crying episodes and disrupted sleeping and eating patterns teething can be uncomfortable but if your baby seems very irritable contact your child's doctor here are some tips to keep in mind when your baby is teething wipe your baby's face often with a cloth to remove the drool and prevent rashes from developing give your baby something to chew on make sure it's big enough so that he or she can't swallow it and that it can't break into small pieces a wet washcloth placed in the freezer for minutes makes a handy teething aid just be sure to wash it after each use rubber teething rings are also good but avoid the ones with liquid inside because they may break if you use a teething ring be sure to take it out of the freezer before it becomes rock hard you don't want to bruise those already swollen gums rub your baby's gums with a clean finger never tie a teething ring around a baby's neck as it could get caught on something and strangle the baby if your baby seems irritable acetaminophen may help but always consult your child's doctor first never place an aspirin against the tooth and don't rub whiskey on your baby's gums also sucking on any finger is normal some children suck their three fingers some suck one some suck a thumb nothing is the standard  Breastfeeding Mandible Maxilla Domestic rabbit Happy Tree Friends Strap-on dildo First aid The Shining (film) Dental caries Chewing gum Urinary incontinence Oral sex Cocaine Hamster Fecal incontinence Professional wrestling holds Drill bit Mattress Cephalic disorder Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dog training Textile manufacturing Diving Carpal tunnel syndrome Garfield Cat Vampire Childbirth Bong Dog Aerial (dance move) Stomach cancer Knife Milton H.

my month old son won't take a bottle he has been breastfed and now it's time to go to daycare i have tried different types of nipples bottles and even a sippy cup messy but somewhat effective we aren't changing the food just the delivery method anybody have a suggestion we battled with this one and found a few things helped first when introducing the bottle don't do it when he is really hungry either try between regular feedings or after nursing for a few minutes second let someone else give him the bottle you should not be the one introducing the bottle because he equates you to the breast have another family member try it third keep trying eventually he will get the hang of it and he will easily switch between breast and bottle when you put the nipple in his mouth squeeze a bit of the milk out so that he can taste it also tell whomever is feeding him to try to replicate the closeness he gets when he is breastfeeding hold him close and secure good luck  Breastfeeding Milk Baby bottle Breast Fertility awareness Nipple Brassiere Infant Infant formula Prolactin Nipple piercing Breast milk Mastitis Breast cancer Childbirth Tasmanian Devil Nestl__ boycott Jaundice Bong Vitamin D Bottle International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Nestl__ Internal ballistics Cat Stomach cancer Breast pump Salad Fingers Platypus Ron and Fez The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Mammary gland Shark PHP Tofu Urinary incontinence Ron Weasley Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Siphon Plastic Champagne (beverage) Tooth Breast bondage Dairy Tea Snake Little Britain HIV Vitasoy Piccolo Junior Saga Phil Hendrie Prolactinoma Social rule Fecal incontinence Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) The Coca-Cola Company Yoko Ono Molotov cocktail New Coke Seabird Cider Kosher foods Domestic rabbit Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Nudity Soft drink B-47 Stratojet Abstraction (computer science) Hypoglycemia Coca-Cola Guinea pig The Lovely Bones Bottlenose Dolphin Wine Erogenous zone Second Battle of the Atlantic Elephant Running Great Teacher Onizuka Guinness Professional wrestling match types Fountain pen Bladderwort Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Insulin American Psycho Mattress Intravenous therapy Wraith (Stargate) Trailer Park Boys Trademark Inheritance (computer science) Hong Kong-style milk tea Obstetrics Big Brother (USA TV series) Water Milkshake Oxytocin Puberty Military history of France

should i be doing anything to encourage my baby he started rolling over at about months old he did it a few times and he has not been doing it this past weeks he gets to a certain point and can't get over the shoulder and just stops i have helped him a few times in hopes that he will get back on track but he still isn't trying on his own a friend told me not to worry maybe he doesn't want to right now any advice my son did exactly the same thing he learned to roll over early and then seemed to forget just give him lots of tummy time and if you want you can roll him over just to see if he'll do it but he's probably focused on something else at the moment he'll roll again don't worry  Kodocha Social rule Shaggy dog story Breastfeeding Friends Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Care Bears Blood on the Tracks Milton H.

what are the possible ramifications of a baby who arches her back constantly my friend has a month old and ever since she was about month old she has constantly and i mean all the time arches her back almost making a c shape with her belly sticking out will this affect her posture and body if she continues to do this my son did the same thing he started the arching because of refulx and eventually his back muscles got really strong and he'd do it all the time he grew out of the reflux and quit arching as soon as he was more mobile and found more fun things to do i'd still tell her to ask her doctor about it  Urinary incontinence Gray Wolf Muscle EastEnders Pitaten Diving Inclusion body myositis Arch bridge Equine conformation Dental brace Childbirth Ork (Warhammer 40,000) Vulcan (Star Trek) Vegeta Friends Rayman 3 One Tree Hill (TV series) Mandible Tai Chi Chuan Suplex Violin Maxilla Trumpet Breaststroke Social rule Abdomen Obesity Professional wrestling holds Autism Elephant Max Martin Massage Milton H.

why do so many people see breast feeding as a bad thing or that they'd rather sleep i'm a mother of three i feed all three n stil feeding my month i dont think that people that dont breast feed r bad or anything but the people that do breast feed shouldn'y be judged because we do n this thing with rather sleepin please when you have a baby you never get much ne else find this i dont have a problem with people that bottle feed as i have put my milk into a bottle at times but i dont think that because we breast feed is a right to get on at us plus having a baby means hardly any more sleep it just bugs me with something i read on hear the other day where something was said there'd rather sleep etc that dont happen when you have kids there is nothing wrong with breastfeed so i dont know why people have to put people like me down about it my friend bottle feed and i had no problems with it everyone is different etc i just dont see the point in bad mouthin people that do what did we do i cover up when i feed my month old baby out side or i'l go some wher no can see once again i have no problem with people bottle feeding as a lot of my mates did well heather yes i was frm what i know n my point in my question was why did people that didnt breast feed their babys for as they put it for sleep why get on us that did on do breast feed their baby i have no point with people bottle feeding at all if you didnt see that b so you can get back off you high horse should read what i said b saying what you thought i was saying as it wasnt it was a question saying why do most people say stuuff b cos we breast feed or feed should i say i have no problem with people that bottle feed every is different but dont get on other peoples backs because they do or did it's a choice just like anything else i breast fed both my sons until they were month old i found i got more sleep because i didn't have to get up and prepare bottles with my first son i supplemented with formula after i'd introduced solids at months because he wasn't gaining but i still nursed him on demand people have choices about lots of things giving up cigarettes while pregnant taking folic acid while pregnant giving up caffeine while pregnant giving up alcohol while pregnant while it's clear that breast feeding is better for the child and the mother there are some cases where it's not possible my cousin tried for four weeks with her daughter her nipples were so raw and bloody that she cried as soon as her daughter started to stir she would sit bolt upright and stare at the wall with tears sliding down her face the whole time her daughter was latched on she called me one day at the time i was the family breastfeeding expert and i told her that in my opinion feeding should be a calm and loving experience where the child and the mother look in each other's eyes i didn't think the benefits of breast feeding were going to outweigh the stress that these two beings were going through there was no way that child was oblivious to her mother's pain and distress that being said i think that a mother who doesn't try to breast feed her child at least for a month is in the same league as a pregnant mother who won't give up her cigarettes selfishness is selfishness choice or not you can at least express and freeze breast milk for a month or two if the thought of an infant's mouth on your nipple makes your toes curl as for people having issues with it in public i find the way some people dress offensive but all i have to do is look away i always used a sling or a shawl in public but people would still give me that disgusted look i'd just meet their eyes and give them a sweet smile if there was a nursing station i'd use it but i refused to ever feed my child in a bathroom now that is disgusting  EastEnders Infant Breast Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Milk Fertility awareness The Shining (film) Childbirth 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Abortion debate Friends Folic acid John the Baptist Pregnancy Infant formula Yoko Ono Little Britain Nipple piercing Breast pump Cat Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Social rule Days of our Lives Kodocha Guinea pig Goodness and value theory The Contender (television series) Pitaten Premature birth Marilyn Monroe Mojave people The Marshall Mathers LP Nestl__ boycott Sin City Sharon Tate Urinary incontinence Breast cancer Hera Jam (TV series) One Life to Live Breast milk Elephant Obstetrics Brassiere Salad Fingers Great Teacher Onizuka Cindy Sheehan Tocopherol The Catcher in the Rye Anne Boleyn The Amber Spyglass Baby bottle YuYu Hakusho Kurt Cobain Babe Ruth The Apprentice 2 Futurama (TV series - season 5) Avenue Q Fecal incontinence Simone Weil Equine conformation The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Nipple Milton H.

please help my baby boy is weeks old and up until two weeks ago has eaten like a horse he was weaned at sixteen weeks and has eaten three substantial meals a day since he was about weeks even though he has been teething quite bad he also cut his milk down to on average oz a day over the last two weeks he has been getting really upset at food times and has cut his solid food down considerable and also his milk a bit i was just wondering whether it is a phase that all babies go through ie teething or not requiring that amount of food any more also has anyone got any ideas on how i can get him to eat some more i have tried everything more than likely your baby is going through a phase but the important thing is to keep offering it is frustrating as a parent to prepare food only to have it go to waste but a child nutritionist advises 'it is not your responsibility to make your child eat but it is your responsibility to provide food ' when my daughter was a baby i would marvel at how she would go through phases and eat a lot and other times it seemed she went all day on three cheerios you do have to look at the more serious side however is your baby losing weight if so a lot these concerns should be addressed with a doctor has your baby been on medication such as antibiotics if this is the case he might need some enzyme replacement trying to digest food without certain enzymes or good bacteria would cause a baby to be fussy when food is offered eating just doesn't feel good a doctor may prescribe something but soy yogurts often have some of the same enzymes your stomach needs and you don't have to use cow's milk yogurt when you refer to your son drinking milk perhaps it is this that is hard for him to digest is he drinking formula maybe he needs a new formula some babies develop allergies and sensitivities to their formulas and need to try a new one if your son drinks formula made with cow's milk try a soy or rice formula lactose intolerance can develop at any time alternative formulas can be a little more expensive but eventually you can go back to the cow's milk formula and eventually even cow's milk if your child isn't allergic also don't forget to burp him i would pat my daughter forever it seemed until i got her to burp keeping bloating down is important if he cries after drinking or eating chances are he has gas pains and begins to associate it with eating and won't want to eat is your baby teething you said he is give him comfort food like rice cereal and even things like frozen bananas to teeth on with supervision of course we don't want choking also he may need smaller portions and more frequent meals he may be tired of having to tank up three times a day and would prefer to graze most babies and toddlers graze meaning they eat a few cheerios later a couple bites of apple sauce later a portion of a teething biscuit an hour later a few bites of pureed carrots it is easier on digestion this way and babies usually know not to over eat they don't like to feel really full by forcing food or tanking him up three times a day he may lose his ability to regulate fullness and actually develop into an over eater babies can consume quite a bit if allowed to eat smaller portions throughout the day again make it available but don't force the issue maybe he has had too many new foods recently go back to basics and only offer a couple different foods that are easy to digest and things you know he likes most babies don't get bored with foods like adults do they prefer favorites over too many new foods evaluate the eating environment is he left in a high chair to eat by himself or does he sit at the table with you and possibly others during meal time at eye level are meal times calm and enjoyable or stressful and rushed perhaps just holding him in your lap while you eat will increase his interest as long as he isn't losing weight and becoming dull and unengaged it is most likely a phase and some minor adjustments will help take a 'this too shall pass' attitude if he is losing weight and doesn't seem to engage with you just seems droopy and lack luster you should have him checked out if the doctor says not to worry then relax and do your best to make mealtimes fun and non forceful good luck  Food Cheese Tooth Diarrhea Soy milk Hamster Soybean Cat Livestock Yoghurt Nutrition Fancy rat Insulin

i ended up letting my month old cry last night and i felt horrible it took me hours to finally get him to go to sleep last night we don't normally have any trouble he may fight it for a couple of minutes then he is gone at he started crying and i went in and looked and his eyes were still closed so i gave him his pacifier and he seemed like he went right back to sleep as soon as i layed back down he started crying again i go back in and this time he is wide awake crying he hasn't had a bottle in the night for months but the last nights or so he has waken wanting one i tried to see if i could calm him without offering a bottle and that didn't work so i gave him a bottle and rocked him for minutes and that booger would not go to sleep he wasn't crying i had changed his diaper burped him he didn't have a fever he wasn't acting like his teeth were bothering him finally since he was calm but wide awake i ended up just laying him down he started to fuss and hold his arms up he just wanted me to hold him i felt horrible but i didn't know what else to do nothing was wrong and i couldn't hold him all night he cried for an hour or so and then he started crying again a hour after that i never wanted to let him cry it out i feel like i am letting him down if i do that i feel like he will think he can't depend on me do you have any other suggestions for me on things i can do if this happens again please thanks so far for all the answers they are all great we've let my boys cry themselves to sleep sometimes at months it's probably teeth and gums though after their last bottle sometimes my wife or i would rub a little oraljel on their gums and that usually soothed them into sleeping you do not let them down when you let them cry like that it's ok to see if they can settle themselves just as ok to pick them up too you sound like you are doing a great job don't worry your baby boy adores you no matter what you do hope this helps good luck  The Contender (television series) Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jon Secada Knots Landing Breastfeeding Friends Social rule 2000 Australian Grand Prix Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders Humphrey Bogart One Piece minor characters The Apprentice 2 Slow Train Coming Satchel Paige Piccolo Junior Saga Pitaten The Subtle Knife Parsifal Oasis (band) Kodocha Milton H.

my son is months old when do they start sleeping through i'm tired ive tried everything he wakes about times a night mind you he still has no teeth ive tried everything thought maybe he is to hot to cold more blankets less blankets heater on heater off hes not waking screaming just a little cry as soon as i touch him hes goses back off but wakes again later this goses on all night plzzzz help have you tried not immediately responding to him to let him try to fall back to sleep himself it sounds like he has got used to you being a comforter to help him back to sleep he needs you to touch him but this means your up eight times a night which must be exhausting it sounds like it has become a bad sleep habit that he hasn't learned how to fall back asleep by himself so it's means changing this so that he doesnt need you to get up to fall back asleep my dd is now mths old she has a teddy that she sleeps with and she has a baby sleeping bag so i dont need to worry about blankets being off her and worry that she is cold she has a dummy that attaches to her pj's so that she can find it when she wakes up and the temperature of the room is always the same she doesnt get drinks during the night and if she cries i wait before i respond to her and she just falls back to sleep herself remember though it will take time to change habits so give it at least three nights before expecting any change instincitively i know with her cry if something is wrong and of course i'm there for her when she is ill but i've had no problem with teething as i've not made a big deal out of it babies are clever and would be quite happy for mum to be there during the night all night but you both need your sleep and it's best they learn early on about how to sleep all night  Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Sleep Miss Saigon Insomnia The Shining (film) Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Characters in the Smurfs The Amber Spyglass The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Friends Atomic Kitten Jam (TV series) Milton H.

does childbirth hurt as much as people tell us and do epidurals help how long till they kick in and does actually getting the needle put into you hurt please only if you have had a baby i did not have an epidural and it was the best decision i could have made for myself the pain was really not that bad i actually felt incredible sense of relief and it actually felt good to push when the time came the contractions are uncomfortable but once they let me push the pain totally went away and it actually felt amazing i was suprised that it felt so powerful i can't even describe the emotion and the spirituality it was absolutely awe inspiring i felt like superwoman when i was pushing him through the ring of fire it was like genesis i don' t know how to explain it but i am sooo soo glad i did not have an epidural they even had the doctor coming in from home to do the epidural i was in tears because i didn't want it and they were going to do it anyways because they were sure i couldn't handle the pain as if i wasn't strong enough to birth my child the way the mothers before me had it's like certain doctors just want to make the extra money off of a medical procedure that actually takes away from such a beautiful experience and convinces women over time that the pain is unbearable like they are too weak to do what is natural for them like they have no inner reserve or intuition or instincts to carry them through ok ok gets off soapbox no epidural for me it did not hurt like everyone would say it's like an orgasm times it's not like a broken bone or a car accident  Childbirth Epidural Theory of conduct Breastfeeding Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma One Tree Hill (TV series) Traumatic brain injury Pregnancy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an W.I.T.C.H.

general q's about teething baby my son is months and he may be teething he's got a slight redness on the cheecks doesnt sleep well at night sometimes fusses for no apparent reason drools exessively and bites down hard on anything he can get his hands on so does teething pain come and go or is it constant how long untill a tooth actually breaks through the skin are hylands tables effective since i'm really not sure i'm not giving him tylenol or even orajel ijust give him a damp washcloth to chew on or a teething ring or rub his gums with my finger but he's miserable so how do the hylands tablets work and how effective teeting pain does come and go the time it takes for a tooth to break through depends on your baby and what tooth he's getting some only take a week or two while others seem like they're never going to break through i never used hyland's tablets but i did use a similar brand that you buy at walgreen's i think the tablets help calm the baby and offer some pain relief please don't be worried about offering your baby some medication for pain relief i would recommend using baby motrin instead of tylenol though the motrin is specifically designed to help deal with the inflammation and the relief comes a little faster and lasts a little longer since some babies can get an upset stomach from motrin give your son small snack with the motrin if he isn't eating any solid foods just give him the motrin right before or right after he has a bottle breastfeeds my son started to teeth when he was ten weeks old good luck  Breastfeeding Tooth Cocaine Paracetamol Childbirth Dog training Carpal tunnel syndrome Adjustable gastric band Tooth enamel Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hamster Dental caries Osteoarthritis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Psoriasis Chronic fatigue syndrome Domestic rabbit Knife Kodocha Knots Landing Migraine Social rule Paget's disease of bone Prostate cancer Customs and etiquette of Japan Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma First aid Fertility awareness Sulfasalazine Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cat Gout Medical prescription Swimming Alcoholic beverage Acne Blackjack Guinea pig Chewing gum Tylenol 1982 Chicago Tylenol murders Piccolo Junior Saga Humphrey Bogart Needle aspiration biopsy Drawn Together Pregnancy Tobacco Oxycodone Babe Ruth Dental brace Massage Urinary incontinence Clinical depression Textile manufacturing Sandy Koufax Group A streptococcal infection The Fairly OddParents Insomnia The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Hash table Masturbation Motorcycle Cannabis (drug) Happy Tree Friends Characters of Naruto Menstrual cup Glen Jacobs Oral sex Ben Johnson (athlete) Fecal incontinence Dog Minor Harry Potter Beasts Mind Over Murder Medical analysis of circumcision Mojave people Cancer Halitosis Pet skunk Shaggy dog story Aloe Squirrel Philmont Scout Ranch Stuttering Comanche Tocopherol Coeliac disease Animal testing Methamphetamine Cuisine of Denmark Hypnosis Insulin One Piece minor characters Withdrawal

month old and rash stool issues my daughter was born july at about weeks old she started getting a diaper rash i tried everything from balmex to cornstartch but it got to the point that it was eating away her skin and the doc gave me diff creams for it i've been using them properly but everytime the rash finally clears up it starts all over again pussing and eating away her skin then it gets better this cycle has happened times now also she has been having very frequent poopy diapers which is ok but i've noticed that lately they have been very soft and there has been some foamy poop colored thin jelly like liquid coming out there were also a few small traces of blood in it a few times but i thought it was ok except now there seems to be more and more little blood streaks with every diaper change shes not straining or constipated so i wouldnt think there would be any reason for blood never delt with these issuses with my first daughter help her doc appt for this is fri any insight till then she is formula fed and has been since she was born she was in the nicu for the first weeks after she was born for breathing problems and the docs started her on formula b c i was still recovering from the c section in a different hospital i'm using the same formula and diapers that they started her on in the nicu sounds exactly like my child when she was weeks old i noticed that her stools always contained mucous streaked blood in them turns out that she was allergic to milk protein since her first symptoms was bloody stools the doctor thought she was most likely alletgic to soy as well she was put on nutramigen but was also allergic to that after months of neocate she is back on nutramigen and doing wondefully at her month check which is only a month away they are going to try her on cow milk formula again anyway it sounds like an allergy to me what you should do is bring a stool sample with you one that has the blood or mucous in it the doctor will tell a lot from just looking at it as long as she is acting normal otherwise then i'm sure your child will be as good as knew once everything has been diagnosed  Urinary incontinence Coeliac disease Fecal incontinence Breastfeeding Food allergy Allergy Prostate cancer Insulin Tofu Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Milk Diarrhea Eczema Infantilism Diaper Crohn's disease Childbirth Food Ebola Obstetrics Cat Group A streptococcal infection Soy milk Cytomegalovirus Feces Syphilis Cheese Hypoglycemia Adjustable gastric band Psoriasis Premature birth Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Multiple chemical sensitivity Asthma Tuberculosis Dietary fiber Traumatic brain injury Infant formula Ice cream Hay fever Tarantula Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Hemorrhoid Jaundice Acne Fancy rat Tattoo Cancer Menstrual cycle Gastroesophageal reflux disease Equine conformation First aid Peanut Zinc Soybean Constipation Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Anal fissure Sento Irritable bowel syndrome Carbon dioxide Smallpox Doxepin Breast milk Medicine Leptospirosis Haloperidol Veganism Colorectal cancer Hookworm Atkins Nutritional Approach Spina bifida Botulism Aspergillosis Decompression sickness Lupus erythematosus Bipolar disorder Glycogen storage disease type I Chronic fatigue syndrome Vampire Livestock Chlorpromazine Dialysis Lyme disease Stuttering Gastroenteritis Cystic fibrosis Pneumonia Protein-energy malnutrition Cirrhosis Elephant Ferret Bovine spongiform encephalopathy

did parents choice formula cause your baby to be constipated or is it normal when you change formulas i have a healthy week old baby she's been on formula only for about the past weeks her bowel movements have been every other day since she was born but the doctor said that was fine as long as the stool wasnt firm which they havent been until yesterday i changed from nestle good start formula to parents choice gentle formula about a week ago it is cheaper and i hear a lot of babies do just as good if not better on it i notice it doesnt dissolve well though unlike the other formulas it leaves a gritty type residue then yesterday she had a poopy diaper and the stool was hard as a rock i called the doc and she said give prune juice etc but shes had more hard poopy diapers since then this coming from a baby who usually only goes poop every other day do you think the formula isnt digesting well or is it just the transition to a new kind thanks with my first daughter i also used the nestle goodstart until she was about months old and then switched to the parent's choice brand for the money reason ans she did just fine but with my month old i tried the parent's choice and as you noticed i also noticed the grit to it and the not dissolving all the way and like your daughter my month old started having very hard stool as well all babies are very different as i'm sure you know so while it may be great for one it might be terrible for another i'm sure that part of it is just b c you changed formulas but i'm also fairly confident that it could very well be the formula i've noticed that similac is a much thinner formula than parent's choice and is a little cheaper than the nestle enfamil is the thinnest of the formulas that i have found and parent's choice is by far the thickest i am going to be switching off of the parent's choice for that very reason and for the hard stool i would rather pay a few dollars more and have a happy baby than save a few bucks and have her tummy in knots all the time lol  Fecal incontinence Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Infantilism Diaper Stomach cancer EastEnders Dietary fiber Escherichia coli O157:H7 The Beatles discography Diarrhea Mattress Microeconomics Irritable bowel syndrome Androgen insensitivity syndrome Infant formula Prostate cancer Care Bears Kodocha Nestl__ Laxative Toilet humour Nestl__ boycott Coeliac disease Boyz II Men 2000 Australian Grand Prix Kimberly-Clark Corporation Yesterday's Enterprise (TNG episode) Hirschsprung's disease Brewery Elimination communication Opportunity rover Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Childbirth Poker jargon Baby Blues Abortion in the United States Diverticulosis Wheel of Fortune Sharon Tate Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Humphrey Bogart Tooth enamel Dorama Tobacco Feces Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Glycogen storage disease type I Royal Assent Sento Unemployment Koala Adjustable gastric band Inflation Education in Germany Knife Capercaillie Rod Stewart Dairy Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Rooibos Computer Ulcerative colitis Cliff Richard Infant Tooth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Crohn's disease Timekeeping on Mars Procter & Gamble Gastroparesis Rent (musical) Sant Thakar Singh Glacier Characters in the Smurfs Terri Schiavo Divorce Marty McFly Shaggy dog story Daylight saving time ALGOL 68 Characters of Lost Confidence trick Gross domestic product Leaf Spina bifida Charmed Bulk vending Prolog Canadian dollar Jon Secada Thermal power station Shit Labour economics Abortion debate Neighbours Botulism

how do i teach my son to self soothe my son is now months old he was never allowed to cry by his father now i have convinced my husband that self soothing is okay it's coming up on years that i haven't had a decent night's sleep i'm sick of getting up or times a night just to cover him and rub his back for him to get back to sleep i've started the self soothing during the day he eats drinks his cup of whatever change the diaper and i put him in his crib for him to take his nap i leave the room sometimes and at times he will cry for a few minutes and be out other times he will cry for or more minutes for me to come and get him but he is months old and needs a nap during the day i hate hearing him scream like he's in pain when i know everything is okay i'm scared the neighbors will complain cause he's screaming like he does when he wants my attention am i doing it right or is it a lost cause p s we are moving soon and he will not be in the room with us anymore i don't want him to be spoiled he thinks when he cries he gets whatever he wants so he's starting to cry and scream for everything he wants he's already starting that and i want to stop it before it gets too bad i don't understand why moms have decided that everytime your baby cries he absolutely needs something i don't believe in letting a baby cry it out for more than a few minutes but i also don't think that every time my baby cries he has a need that absolutely has to be met at that moment the whole argument crying is the only way he can communicate so if he is crying he's telling you he needs something is sometimes completely false i've seen toddlers and children who are able to communicate cry sometimes because it's late at night and they are grouchy seriously even adults get grouchy sometimes have you ever seen a mom or dad tell a year old it's time to go to bed usually they whine and cry because they don't want to go to bed a baby can be fussy because he is overly tired and needs to take a nap i know my baby and i know what he needs the key is to determine what the crying is about if he's crying because he's hungry that is a cry that abslutely needs to be met if he's crying because he needs to be held absolutely hold him and love him if he's crying because he's grouchy and fighting sleep then it's ok to let him cry it out once again if he's truly crying due to a need for a nap he should only cry it out for a few minutes and then he will go to sleep if he cries for more than say minutes he might be crying for other reasons that need to be addressed it seems like you are a caring mother who loves their child but does not want him to become spoiled follow your motherly instincts learn what his cries mean and you will for sure make the right decisions  Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Characters in the Smurfs Knots Landing Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Shining (film) Avenue Q Friends About a Boy Miss Saigon Pitaten The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Phoebe Buffay's songs The Marshall Mathers LP The Amber Spyglass The Contender (television series) Night (book) Ron and Fez The Catcher in the Rye The Subtle Knife The Inside 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Kodocha Breastfeeding The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

public daycare vs at home daycare which do you prefer taking your child to a public daycare with many caregivers and plenty of children of an in home daycare with caregiver and a few children why i wil be looking for someone to care for my month old very shortly i'm very apprehensive about the in home caregivers after the baby kaleb incident month old being shaken by nanny and having severe outcomes but i can't stay at home forever any advice i'm very worried that they won't take good care of my baby boy they won't rock him to sleep and wont' feed him right first time mom paranoid i know it's okay to be paranoid it's your child while i don't have an opinion about in home versus out of home day cares i will be staying at home so i've never had to really research it i can remind you that shaken baby is not limited to at home care it is much more important that you meet and trust the individuals who will be caring for your child than that they care for him in a certain environment don't choose one over the other because of someone else's experience because things like that are not limited to one type of daycare but rather the personality of the providers make sense sorry not much sleep last night edit i used to be a nanny and i guarantee i gave better care than any day care the mother could have taken her child to that being said she did a ton of research i had to go to like three interviews before she decided on me and she picked me from like people i think it's really more about you being comfortable with the individuals not necessarily just the situation good luck  Infantilism Day care Breastfeeding Transsexuality Social rule Dissociative identity disorder Childbirth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Attachment theory EastEnders Abortion debate Palliative care Phil of the Future Adoption Laura Schlessinger Humphrey Bogart Narcissism The Emancipation of Mimi Diaper Jon Secada Care Bears Feral child Surveillance Polygamy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Epilepsy Customs and etiquette of Japan Friends Health insurance Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Milton H.

i'm nursing my week old and i think she's allergic to milk proteins both of my other two were as well but i didn't breastfeed more then a week with either of them is there any dairy i can eat drink cheeses yogurts etc i am fairly certain it is the cow's milk proteins giving her problems she has green slimy poop which usually is because of something mom ate drank that disagrees with baby like an allergy when i've drank milk she got it after i hadn't had any milk to drink and then not thinking ate some pudding i've read that it is extremely uncommon for a baby to be lactose intolerant but being allergic to milk proteins is the most common cause of the yucky poops she's been having she does have a diaper rash as well it cleared up before i ate the pudding and then it came back it all started when she was about a week old which is when i started drinking loads of milk i had always gotten my calcium with supplements before that one day milk sounded soooo good so i drank it and kept on drinking it then her poop changed colors on me and was no longer seedy like it should be i do feed from one breast each feeding alternating for each time she eats i do that to ensure she gets both the fore and hind milk my oldest was put on soy formula when he was a baby years ago my older daughter was put on nutramigen when she was a baby the nutramigen worked wonders for her where as prosobee didn't do much for my son i'm trying my best to continue breastfeeding for at the very least months so if i can i will yeah that really sounds like a milk protein allergy to me i would eliminate all dairy to start with and then see how it goes i know it's a tall order and a pita but if you are committed to bf'ing even for a little while it is worth it for both of you by the way on the la leche league forums and kellymom com forums there are sections dedicated to allergies in the breastfed baby regardless of how long bf'ing works for you and your baby lll is supportive and has been extremely helpful to me when i have run into problems best of luck you sound like a wise mama  Milk Soy milk Cheese Dairy Veganism Infant formula Vegetarianism Breast milk Allergy Food Yoghurt Food allergy Lactose intolerance Dairy product Tofu Cat Infant Coeliac disease Guinea pig Dairy cattle Vitamin D Protein Ice cream Livestock Dairy farming Insulin Kosher foods Childbirth Breast Crohn's disease Nestl__ boycott Raw milk Dog Elephant Meat analogue Lactobacillus acidophilus Breast pump Rice pudding Atkins Nutritional Approach Breakfast Elimination communication Chicken Urinary incontinence Butter Fecal incontinence Nipple piercing Baby bottle Kit Kat Pasteurization Obstetrics Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Vitasoy Rooibos Kashrut Flatulence Nestl__ Prolactinoma Chocolate Omega-3 fatty acid Stone Cold Steve Austin Fasting Cuisine of the Philippines Fertility awareness Prostate cancer Hedgehog Cattle Jaundice Fancy rat Pet skunk Infantilism Domestic goat Hera Dieting Cuisine of Denmark Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Giant Panda Hay fever Lisa the Vegetarian Negima Nutrition Equine conformation Tooth Charles Darwin's illness The Super Milk-chan Show Trailer Park Boys Toilet humour Tattoo Irritable bowel syndrome Pitaten Fiddler on the Roof

let down question does any one not actually feel there milk let down i am exclusively breastfeeding my week old son and i rarely feel my letdown reflex is this a bad thing how do you describe the letdown as feeling the few times i remember feeling it it was kind of a burning sensation and it has only happened a few times we have had a problem with slow weight gain could this be the culprit thanx i have been working closely with a l c and we have had weekly weigh ins things are improving she is on vacation to the who asked it took him until he was weeks old to get back up to his birth weight now he is at he gained from rd to th week from th to th and from th to th lines him up to gain at least a lb in a month he is evening out well i'm not worried we are not big people my year old looks like some year olds and the reason we had such a rough start not to place blame completely but his uninformed doctor misinformed me about nursing on demand which i do now her theory was min each side every hours regardless i educated myself ''online'' and started to work with a lactation consultant and things are good now she 'the doc' even tried to get me to supplement stating that if he still eats after mins he is still hungry and my boobs were empty needles to say i'm in the process of finding a new doc i sadly fell into the rut many women do and i see why so many have a hard time with breastfeeding nowdays it's a disgrace if i wasn't so stubborn i woulda gave up hi susan whew you make me feel better i do weigh him weekly and he is in between oz a week i so pump twice a day also its all i can do he nurses a good bit and i can't pump all day i think my milk was slow to come in also and he wasn't feeding enough to help due to poor advice from doc i am using the consultant for guidance and in the process of changing docs hey we're in similar boats i asked the same question within another question a few days ago too i don't feel anything when my milk is letting down and my five week old was lbs oz when she was born lbs oz when we brought her home and she dropped to lbs oz even after that i fed on demand but my milk was slow to come in i still question my output but i've been pumping now too are you pumping i ended up having to supplement with formula until she got back to her birth weight it took her a little bit less than three weeks to get back there if i give her any formula at all now it's less than oz daily but i won't tell you to supplement because i understand how it sabatoges your milk supply too pumping on the other hand will only help your milk supply some people suggest pumping for minutes after every feeding i haven't been able to pump more than twice per day myself pumping tricks your body into thinking you need to make more milk as for your baby if your pediatrician is out can you even just bring him in just for a weight check my ped's office lets you do this without needing to see the doctor so you have piece of mind but it also sounds like you just want to be sure your baby is really on the right track good moms do that i bet your son really is doing just fine i hope you can get that piece of mind soon one thing i did was step on the scale myself then step on the scale holding my daughter and subtract the difference to see how much roughly she weighs it at least let me see she was gaining not losing  Childbirth Milk Fertility awareness Dialysis Folic acid Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart Milton H.

what's the deal with bottled water specifically for baby what makes it different just curious if you mean nursery water it is fluoridated whereas most bottled water comes from either non fluoridated sources or has the fluoride removed unfortunately what many parents do not realize is that you are not supposed to use fluoridated water to make infant formula the american dental association recommends against it basically the makers of nursery water are just out to get your money at the possible expense of your baby's health while most of the problems caused by using fluoridated water to make infant formula are not life threatening it is always better to be safe than sorry http www ada org public topics fluoride infantsformula asp infants formula and fluoride the ada offers these recommendations so parents caregivers and health care professionals have some simple and effective ways to reduce fluoride intake from reconstituted infant formula for infants who get most of their nutrition from formula during their first months ready to feed formula is preferred to help ensure that they do not exceed the optimal amount of fluoride intake if liquid concentrate or powdered infant formula is the primary source of nutrition it can be mixed with water that is fluoride free or contains low levels of fluoride to reduce the risk of fluorosis examples are water that is labeled purified demineralized deionized distilled or reverse osmosis filtered water many grocery stores sell these types of drinking water for less than per gallon breast milk is widely acknowledged as the most complete form of nutrition for infants the american academy of pediatrics recommends human milk for all infants except for the few for whom breastfeeding is determined to be harmful parents and caregivers should consult with their pediatrician family physician or dentist on the most appropriate water to use in their area to reconstitute infant formula ask your pediatrician or family physician whether water used in infant formula should be sterilized first sterilization however will not remove fluoride  Fluoride Tooth Fluoride therapy Hypoglycemia Tocopherol Baby bottle Nutrition Water Vegetarianism Childbirth Phimosis Dairy Cancer Omega-3 fatty acid Rickets Water purification Nestl__ boycott Dental caries Fertility awareness Brewery Infant Bottled water Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Growth hormone treatment Alcoholic beverage Soybean Food and Drug Administration Pediatrics Nestl__ Dietary fiber Androgen insensitivity syndrome Bong Microeconomics Coca-Cola Atkins Nutritional Approach Water (molecule) Tofu Medical analysis of circumcision Dieting Cytomegalovirus Chocolate Veganism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Nuclear power Autism epidemic Rooibos Herpes simplex virus Intravenous therapy Physician Protein-energy malnutrition Thimerosal History of intersex surgery Postpartum depression Water supply Energy development Paracetamol Publicly funded medicine American Academy of Pediatrics Premature birth Domestic rabbit Sewage treatment Vitamin D Rum Prolactinoma Dioxin Controversies in autism Vitasoy Alcoholism Prostate cancer Wal-Mart Education in the United States Sugar substitute Biodiesel Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Insulin Vegetarian nutrition HIV Eutrophication Fluorine Autism Cocaine Palliative care Sex assignment Adoption Jet engine AIDS

i kinow it's safe to nurse when you have the flu even beneficial but if you haven't eaten in days what does that do to your milk i have read that if you don't eat so many calories a day that your milk can become toxic i have heard this as well it releases chems tht are not good for baby but i heard that it was mostly for those who were on high protein diets and not getting enough carbs if you are worried call you dr they would know and even the nurse could answer your question if you have not eaten or been able to keep any fluids down you might not be making enough milk i would call your dr just to make sure if your baby is really young you do not want them to loose too much weight  Breastfeeding Milk Atkins Nutritional Approach Dieting Healthy eating Low-carbohydrate diet Calorie restriction South Beach diet Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Koala Omega-3 fatty acid Protein Little Britain Guinea pig Cheese Domestic goat Stomach cancer Nutrition Chocolate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Singlish Clean animals Coeliac disease Methylsulfonylmethane Polychlorinated biphenyl Egg (food) Fecal incontinence Carburetor Childbirth Sugar substitute Veganism Bodybuilding Junk food Food allergy Fasting Elephant Vegetarianism Bong Tocopherol Soy milk Soft drink Folic acid Food Tofu Cat Vitamin D Super Size Me Protein-energy malnutrition Chicken Raw food diet Aspartame Comanche Insulin Giant Panda Sucralose Calorie Chronic fatigue syndrome Carbohydrate Tannin Gluten-free, casein-free diet Cancer Vegetarian nutrition Influenza Macular degeneration Anorexia nervosa Hiberno-English Captain Beefheart Weight training Kosher foods Pet skunk Joke Kashrut Kit Kat Zone diet Food guide pyramid Nipple Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Terri Schiavo In-N-Out Burger Oily fish Stroke Retinol Crohn's disease Diabetes mellitus Phoebe Buffay's songs Pasteurization Prostate cancer Binge eating disorder Adjustable gastric band Chanakya Life extension Slim Fast Gastroenteritis Ron and Fez MyPyramid Alzheimer's disease Infant formula I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue

feeding a month old whipped cream i was at a party yesterday and my friend's very nice uncle offered to hold my fussy month old so i could eat my ice cream he was sitting behind me with the baby and when i finished my ice cream i turned around and saw that the baby had white in his mouth i grabbed a rag and said oh he spit up and the aunt said oh no that was me i just gave him whipped cream i was really surprised that anyone would give someone else's month old baby food especially garbage like whipped cream without asking them first i took him back and said calmly i really prefer he not have any whipped cream it might upset his tummy all he has ever had his breastmilk i know she meant well but i thought people just knew that it wasn't a good idea how would you have handled that situation and do you have a similar story to share this is my rd child and whipped cream has dairy in it as well as a sugar nitrious oxide fats and artificial ingredients like stabilizers giving any of these to an infant is not healthy and can be downright dangerous because infants are far more likely to have a bad reaction i don't want my infant ingesting that don't believe that just because they sell it on a grocery store shelf that you should be eating it and no he didn't like it i'm not a health nut but i don't like people giving my child anything without asking he could have had a food allergy or lactose intolerance it is common sense to ask the mom before giving a baby anything to eat oh geez i am years old and i am not going to drink just breastmilk because my son does obviously i am not going to have the same diet as a month old the ice cream was home made and i skipped the whipped cream canned and just had a little with no cake i eat very healthy with the occasional sweet i would've had a fit i'm impressed that you handled it so well i would never even think to give someone else's child at any age food without their permission thank god he's not allergic to anything they could've caused a serious problem i'm also really surprised at the number of people on here who think you're a nutjob for this whether they agree on the issue of giving a month old tastes of food or not it's really just a matter of it being your child and you deciding what is best for him  Breastfeeding Milk Ice cream Dairy Food Soft drink Coffee Chocolate Cream (food) Veganism Healthy eating Hamster Cheese Dairy product Soy milk Cat Aspartame Tea German cuisine Food allergy Organic food Hypoglycemia Peanut Characters in the Smurfs Nutrition Cuisine of Denmark Bread Lactose intolerance Shaggy dog story Egg (food) Peanut butter Fecal incontinence Kashrut Guinea pig Atkins Nutritional Approach Spidey Super Stories Breast milk Dog Soybean Meat analogue The dozens Mountain Dew Diarrhea French cuisine Butter Milkshake Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fancy rat Gelato Pancake Theory of conduct Street food Breakfast Cuisine of Malaysia Foodborne illness Apple Cha chaan teng Hedgehog Coeliac disease Sugar substitute Stomach cancer Allergy Multiple chemical sensitivity Pepsi-Cola Infantilism Carbon dioxide Sugar Crohn's disease Margarine Pizza Tooth Trans fat Pasteurization Snack food New Coke Tocopherol Omega-3 fatty acid The Apprentice 2 Coca-Cola Obesity McDonald's The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Ron and Fez The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Rum Fast food Eating Raw food diet Domestic rabbit

baby's seperation anxiety driving me nuts my daughter is months old and has a really bad case of seperation anxiety and its driving me crazy she is crying all the time if i even put her on the floor she is crying i feel like i'm going crazy always having to hold her and not that i don't love the fact of being needed i need to be able to sleep and get things done cause i do have another daughter and for some reason daddy just isn't good enough and her cry is just god awful i really can't stand it what can i do so we are both a little happier this is why many people say that raising children is so difficult because babies and older children go through phases that take a lot of emotional energy out of their parents what you must understand during your child's entire life is they will go through phases children are not emotionally or psychologically developed enough to know how to react to situations that is what parents are for to teach them in a 'civilized' adult way and you have to remember while going through these phases that your baby girl is not doing these things because she is a bad child to spite you or because you've done something wrong but she will push push your buttons to see where you draw the line and this is an important part of childhood development children ask for boundries it is what makes them feel safe and secure with you as their guiding force through their life your daughter may be going through an emotionally stressful time right now as she realized that she is mobile and can function with out your help or as she becomes more mentally emotionally advanced these milestones can be scary things for children just like when they begin to walk or talk they get all these new feelings and thoughts and abilities and it can be overwhelming new unexplored space for them so they may become clingy act out badly and this is the time they need their parents to be understanding and to comfort and help them along however when it comes to behavior it's important to let the child know that it is okay to feel these feelings but not okay to act out in a negative way so if your child wants you to hold her all the time endulge that a little so she finds security in you during this time but also let her know that it is okay if you have to put her down and go to the restroom or make dinner or clean or just have a moment to yourself it may not be a super idea to leave her with a lot of different people at this time however if you must leave her with someone else let it be just one person so she can get use to that person as well by the way this phase is self limiting and will end with in a month or less my advice is to be very attentive to your child's behavior and give her what she needs but also be very clear about your boundries and come up with some creative correction when she over steps those boundries as she gets older i have typed way too much but if you would like me to recommend some books to you email me and i would be happy to do so it is just so important that you create a security within your daughter through these times both with your love and attention when she needs you and with boundries as well as she gets older  Infantilism Autism Narcissism Theory of conduct Grief Transsexuality EastEnders Procrastination Asperger syndrome Urinary incontinence Transactional analysis Humphrey Bogart Friends Social rule Second language acquisition Attachment theory Stuttering Pitaten Psychoanalysis Nicomachean Ethics Mental retardation Scientology beliefs and practices A Course In Miracles Traumatic incident reduction Milton H.

breastmilk not enough well it's few days that i feel that my breast doesn't have that much milk and my month old son refuses breast so i pump to keep the milk suuply but i pump only ml from both breasts so that's not enough him i give him formula but he's so eager to grab a watermelon bread to suck on isn't it dangerous if he swallows a piece of bread or watermelon maybe it's time to give him fruits thank you ml oz is a very large pumping output it is normal to have to pump more than once to make enough milk for one feeding even the best breastpump can only get of the milk in the breast unlike a baby who gets all the milk in the breast and signals the breast to make more right now you should work on getting your baby back to breast that is key to making your life easier as for solids before months is too soon for pretty much all babies but if he can self feed he might be ready read these http www borstvoeding com voedselintroductie vast voedsel rapley guidelines html won't he choke many parents worry about babies choking however there is good reason to believe that babies are at less risk of choking if they are in control of what goes into their mouth than if they are spoon fed this is because babies are not capable of intentionally moving food to the back of their throats until after they have learnt to chew and they do not develop the ability to chew until after they have developed the ability to reach out and grab things thus a very young baby cannot easily put himself at risk because he cannot get the food into his mouth in the first place on the other hand the action used to suck food off a spoon tends to take the food straight to the back of the mouth causing the baby to gag this means that spoon feeding has its own potential to lead to choking and makes the giving of lumpy food with a spoon especially dangerous it appears that a babies general development keeps pace with the development of his ability to manage food in his mouth and to digest it a baby who is struggling to get food into his mouth is probably not quite ready to eat it it is important to resist the temptation to 'help' the baby in these circumstances since his own developmental abilities are what ensure that the transition to solid feeding takes place at the right pace for him this process is also what keeps him safe from choking on small pieces of food since if he is not yet able to pick up small objects using his finger and thumb he will not be able to get for example a pea or a raisin into his mouth once he is able to do this he will have developed the necessary oral skills to deal with it putting food into a babies mouth for him overrides this natural protection and increases the risk of choking http www llli org faq solids html your baby is starting to get ready for solids when he is about four months old he becomes more sociable playing and holding conversations with you during a nursing session he has a growth spurt and nurses more frequently for a while he imitates the chewing motions you make whilst eating he is practicing you will know that he is really ready to start solids when he is about six months old he can sit up without any support he continues to be hungry despite more frequent nursing which is unrelated to illness or teething he has lost the tongue thrusting reflex and does not push solids out of his mouth he can pick up things with his finger and thumb pincer grasp babies who are ready for solids can usually feed themselves mothers often report that they knew their babies were ready when they picked up food from a plate chewed it swallowed it and wanted more  Professional wrestling holds Dairy Chopsticks Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Carburetor Hamster Equine conformation Dog training Coeliac disease Milton H.

baby on the way i am due to have my first child within the next two months my concern is my dog he is only a few years old very big and very loveable he is good with children and other animals if he were to ever hurt anyone or thing it would be because he is too loveable as he love love looooves to cuddle my concern is that he is going to become jealous when the baby is born he is the last animal that has joined our family and hasn't had to get used to anyone new around has anyone had any problems with their animals when a baby has come into the house how have you introduced them and made the arrangement ok i've heard a lot of people have had problems with their animals and wanted to know if anyone has had any experience in this area now my dog is about pounds part bulldog and part boxer we have let him sniff around the babies room and we do feel that he will be protective over her also he is very nosy so if something new is around he wants to check it out asap my friend brought her month old over and she was being stiff and holding her way up so he couldn't see that made him anxious and he wanted to know what was there that he wasnt allowed to see im just nervous ever since we bought him he has slept in the bed with us we have slowly been teaching him to sleep on the floor and learn some boundaries i think he'll be fine once he gets accustomed to the idea like i said im just nervous and was hoping to see what other people in the situation had done hi i have two dogs myself a yellow lab and a siberian husky and i was actually amazed at how great they were with my son when i brought him home from the hospital he is now my husky was so protective and curious about my son every little cry my son would make he would run up to his bassinet to make sure he was ok he would also just walk up to him and check on him from time to time my lab didn't really bother with him all that much as he grew older my dogs were always very gentle with him and now that he's two he will sit on the lab and jump on her like a horse and she just lays there my husky on the other hand just walks away if he tries to play with him in that manner the only advice that i got was that when the baby is born and still in the hospital it's good to bring a blanket home or a beanie that the baby has worn so the dogs can get used to the smell my husband did this when he went home to get some things while i was still in the hospital i'm sure everything will be fine with your dog and that your baby will have a great friend in him growing up good luck with everything sylvia  Shaggy dog story Pitaten EastEnders Humphrey Bogart About a Boy Care Bears Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Knots Landing Dog training Breastfeeding 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Blood on the Tracks Lauren Bacall Characters in the Smurfs The Death Gate Cycle Garfield Babe Ruth Slow Train Coming Diving Meat Loaf One Tree Hill (TV series) Dog agility Sharon Tate The Shining (film) Infantilism Dog Into the West (miniseries) Days of our Lives Romulus and Remus 1957 World Series Siberian Husky Family Guy Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Fairly OddParents Pet skunk Blankets (graphic novel) Comanche Alaskan husky Urinary incontinence Kitchen The Star Wars Holiday Special Avenue Q Kodocha Aphrodite Static Shock Honey and Clover Marilyn Monroe Piccolo Junior Saga Daredevil The Contender (television series) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The Smoking Room Melanie Wilkes Lady and the Tramp Good Times Waylon Jennings The Amber Spyglass Poker jargon Jam (TV series) Socrates Sleeping Murder Characters of Lost Satchel Paige Animal Farm Sudden infant death syndrome Cliff Richard Traumatic brain injury Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fancy Crane Undergrads Sin City Bringing It All Back Home Hamster Macbeth The Catcher in the Rye Out-of-body experience Domestic rabbit Philip J.

does anyone get gov't help other than wic what is it how does it work i'm sure it's diff in ever state but i'm just wondering about people's experiences or do you know someone that's on something well i'm on medicaid reason being we were in the process of getting medical insurance when i found out i was pregnant as a result no one would except me we had a hard time getting approved too but finally did its no different then any other insurance for us except right now we don't have to pay for it but i get to go to an actual doctor alot of people believe you can only go to the health department and the treatment is the same especially with the obgyn alot of people told me they would only give me one ultrasound being on medicaid but they were wrong you get as many as the ob thinks you need and i get to have my baby in a hospital there are alot of rumours that its at a birthing center which isn't true its basically the same as having medical insurance only difference is you are not paying for it and months after you have the baby your medicaid is cancelled my opinion is that maybe instead for someone like me who could afford to pay a little bit instead of paying nothing should have to pay something maybe not as much as regular insurance cost but not get it for free either for instance my daughter is on peachcare and its the same as any other insurance she goes for yearly checkups and to a real pediatrician but once she turned we started paying a monthly fee here in ga it doesn't work any differently other than the pay now i'm not on wic we could have qualified for it but we can afford food so there was no reason for us to try and get it as far as experience with it it has been great and they were very helpful  Health insurance Health care in the United States Medicaid Medicare (United States) Insurance Life insurance Canadian and American health care systems compared Pregnancy Medical malpractice Annuity Medicare (Canada) Legal aspects of transsexualism Hillary Rodham Clinton Health maintenance organization Unemployment EastEnders Prenatal diagnosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma US health reform under FDR Wal-Mart Flat tax Food and Drug Administration Childbirth Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Theory of conduct Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services National Kidney Foundation Singapore Abortion American Medical Association United States Postal Service Chiropractic Education in Germany Transsexuality Stomach cancer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pharmaceutical company Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Economics Nursing home Hormone replacement therapy (trans) National Health Service Pet skunk Kodocha Variable universal life insurance Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Humphrey Bogart Medicine Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Circumcision MMORPG Mutual fund Taxation in the United States Circumcision advocacy Open access Growth hormone treatment Arguments for and against drug prohibition Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Social Security Administration Neighbours Midwifery Alcoholics Anonymous Mental Health Act 1983 Pseudoscience Involuntary commitment Education in the United States Urinary incontinence Medicare (Australia) Managed care Emergency Medical Services Philosophical skepticism U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Friends Terri Schiavo Alternative medicine Copyright Public Eye Anorexia nervosa Social rule Folic acid 2003 California recall Health savings account Medical prescription HIPAA Knots Landing Edith Nourse Rogers Vicente Fox Canada Health Act Traumatic brain injury Fecal incontinence Traditional Chinese medicine In vitro fertilisation Microeconomics

weaning my son i breast feed my month old and plan to keep it up until he's a year he does great with stage two baby food although we dont hold to a strict schedule of when and how much i got to thinking about it and realized that if i want to be done around his birthday i should start setting up a plan what are some things i should implement now to make weaning a transition and not a battle of wills my biggest one is bed time and at night its sooo easy to just pop him on a boob and put him to sleep or back to sleep obviously i dont want that to be the only way he sleeps how did other breast feeding moms do it without too much of a battle you may wish to begin by taking away certain predictable nursings sessions and replacing them with some more solids the thing is is that he is too young to start on whole milk just yet and you'd likely have to supplement with some artificial milk your doctor knows you best and could make some reccomendations i can truly understand the nighttime feeds those are usually the last to go especially because they hold the most convenience for us giving yourself mo is very generous just take things slowly and anticipate some bumps along the way if your baby isn't ready then this may be more difficult that you anticipate child led weaning is a widely growing popularity and perhaps something you may wish to look into you may be suprised once your child hits mo that him and you may not be ready to let go of your special time some sites that have many gentle weaning suggestions http www lalecheleague org nb nbweaning html http www picosearch com cgi bin ts pl  Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence Cross site scripting HyperText Transfer Protocol Puberty Shaggy dog story Breast Milk Humphrey Bogart World Wide Web Kitten Internet Infant Common Unix Printing System Apollo 8 New York Giants Koala Dairy Pok__mon Live!

i told my niece its a bad idea to sleep with her baby what do you think her baby is month old and she sleeps with her because the baby doesnt cry if she gets to sleep with her mother this all started because the baby was really colicy for about the st months now the baby still cries unless she gets to sit on her moms lap or is being held no one else works she has to be with her mom her mom sleeps with her now because she cries if they put her in her own crip i told her its a terrible idea i told her she needed to let her get used to her own crib is it me or is this baby learning to cry to manipulate her mom well my daughter who's months now slept in the bed with my husband and i until she was about eight months she slept in a co sleeper from there she slept in a portable crib that we kept in our room until she was about one the first week of her sleeping in her own room was rough but she adapted quite nicely and doesn't have any trouble sleeping by herself i don't think anything is terrible about a mother having her child close to her and pediatricians have said that a baby does not know anything about manipulating the environment until they're at least months do you have children sometimes people who don't have kids don't really understand what it's like this will do no harm for the baby's development and the baby will eventually transition into her own sleeping area in due time babies grow up quickly and before you know it the world will began to take its toll like it does on all of us i think we should keep our kids as close to us as we can because one day they will start to seperate naturally and we will wish for those days good day  Tupac Shakur Sudden infant death syndrome Breastfeeding EastEnders Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Life to Live Days of our Lives Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friends Ben Johnson (athlete) Knots Landing The Catcher in the Rye About a Boy She Loves You The Shining (film) Macbeth Little Girl Lost (The Twilight Zone) Kurt Cobain Charmed Phoebe Buffay's songs Co-sleeping The Amber Spyglass The Marshall Mathers LP Baby Blues Milton H.

how to introduce a spoon at nine months i would like to introduce a spoon to my daughter so she can eat things like soup or breakfast cereal is there any best way to go about it i don't want her to expect me to spoon feed her at every meal she is nine months old she's never used a spoon before she only eats finger foods has done since weaning started at months most little babies do not start out with a spoon they start with their pincher grips and eat finger foods off a plate the spoon part comes later i think it would be a good idea to give your baby a spoon so she he can see it and get used to feeling it in his her hand he or she will start imitating you and eventually start using the spoon well enough to use it to eat your baby will be well over months old before it gets the concept of using a spoon for eating food unless of course you are using it to feed him her  Spoon Breakfast cereal Breakfast Chinese cuisine Salad Fingers Meal Breastfeeding Korean cuisine Roman eating and drinking Japanese cuisine MRE Cuisine of Thailand Little Britain Jewish cuisine Soup Restaurant Cuisine of Denmark Pea soup Fork Sea-Monkey Coeliac disease Pancake Full English breakfast Cuisine of Laos Yum cha Table setting Russian cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Greasy spoon Joke Spork Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Vegetarianism Tlingit Comanche Kitchen Food Anorexia nervosa Eating Culture of Ancient Rome David Hume Pizza Vegetarian cuisine Cereal Technology Brunch Fasting Elephant Kodocha Cheerios Idli Ramen Tomato Menu German cuisine Giant Panda Hygiene Customs and etiquette of Japan The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Bengali cuisine Conveyor belt sushi Hiccup Basic English Dim sum John Harvey Kellogg The Night of the Hunter British cuisine Porridge Folic acid 613 mitzvot Ron and Fez Baroque chess Koala Snack food Culture of Somalia Cha chaan teng Vampire Passover Kitten Peruvian cuisine Rationing in the United Kingdom during and after World War II French cuisine Wood carving Swedish cuisine Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Soy protein Food and Drug Administration Swedish Chef Maize Knife Cuisine of Africa Cuisine of Singapore Quinoa Humphrey Bogart Japanese tea ceremony Veganism EastEnders Rice pudding

can breastfeeding make you lose weight after having a baby of course the results aren t instantaneous and you aren t going to lose pound after pound of weight each time that your newborn wants to feed it is more or less a gradual change with the most concentrated affect being seen only after you wean your baby from breast milk however if you feel disappointment at this you might want to keep in mind that it took nine months for you to put on the weight and it will take you almost as long to lose the weight if you are doing it in a healthy manner breastfeeding weight loss link has long been known although it is only catching on with more and more mothers as of late that said one of the reasons that you gain weight when you are pregnant is because your body is gearing itself up for those months ahead when you will be breastfeeding your baby it has been shown that breastfeeding mothers will sometimes use up to calories a day while they are breastfeeding weight loss with those types of figures then seems a foregone conclusion right the only problem comes if your food intake is larger than those calories you expend over and above your normal intake to read the full answer see http www shops flower com pregnacyweightloss breastfeeding weight loss php  Breastfeeding Milk Dieting Childbirth Fertility awareness Atkins Nutritional Approach Protein-energy malnutrition Folic acid Infant Pregnancy Tocopherol Obesity Super Size Me Infant formula Vitamin D International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Breast milk Breast Nestl__ boycott Omega-3 fatty acid Brassiere Prolactin Insulin Puberty Jaundice Nipple piercing Anorexia nervosa Hypoglycemia Domestic rabbit Weight training Urinary incontinence Jet engine Cytomegalovirus Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Adjustable gastric band Mastitis Nutrition EastEnders Macular degeneration Hearing impairment Guinea pig Haloperidol Human height Abortion debate Fasting Prolactinoma Vegetarianism Medical analysis of circumcision Infantilism Protein Blue Whale Low-carbohydrate diet Miscarriage Carburetor Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Mountain Gorilla Calorie Glycogen storage disease type I Oxytocin Stuttering Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Docosahexaenoic acid Cat Stewie Griffin Elimination communication M60 machine gun Clinical depression Gastric bypass surgery Breast pump Breast cancer Fancy rat Vitamin C Social rule Chlorpromazine Oily fish Sugar substitute Weight Watchers Prostate cancer Dairy Dietary fiber Koala Nipple HIV Life extension Nerpa Hyperglycemia Tofu Tooth Cancer Acne Multiple sclerosis Novelty (locomotive) Chevrolet Corvair Health issues and the effects of cannabis Hyperprolactinaemia

my month old rolled off our bed what's going to happen some history i'm an idiot i walked away to go pee and her big sister was on the bed with her and seconds later i hear a thud and then screaming i can't believe i left a yr old to watch a mo old it happened about hours ago and she seems fine but anyone else experienced it was about feet to the ground now dont you dare feel bad this happened to me a lot with my two kids my oldest son was so jealous of my daughter when she was born and he was five every single time i had him watch her for a second or two she ended up getting hurt including falling off the bed not once but twice she is fine even though we never saw the doctor but my son sure got his butt reamed if you ever need another minute to pee take the baby and put her in her car seat and put that in front of the open bathroom door i know you will miss your privacy some but with your other child already around for four years old i bet you havent seen much of that in a while anyways but this way you can keep an eye on her while you 'go' just in case it takes more than a second or two you can also make a bed out of a bunch of quilts on the floor of your bedroom or whatever room is closest to the bathroom and leave her there only if it's safe from animals and such that way if she happens to roll over she doesnt fall anywhere meanwhile if you have any questions or concerns please go to this website run by the dr spock himself this book was my bible when my kids were young and so far my yr old son my yr old daughter and my year old younger son are just fine http www drspock com this guy knows stuff he used to be a doctor for real so stop worrying if your baby is not showing any signs of a concussion by now she should be perfectly fine just dont use your big sister as a babysitter anymore until she knows what's right and what's not acceptable in baby watching and maybe deals with a little jealousy herself totally normal for her age btw good luck and get some rest you are not a bad mom  Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) The Fairly OddParents EastEnders What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

our baby pukes every time we feed him practically what do we do every time we feed our baby he seems to puke part of it or most of it up he's and a half weeks old the problem is he doesn't always want to take the breast so it makes things harder and we are forced to also supplement and feed formula and pump at other times too he seems to puke sometimes after or minutes and even at times an hour later at first we thought it was maybe something to do with the bottles which we've tried different types liner types bubble free types then we tried formula types as well no luck there we thought of lactose free formula but according to the pharmacist it probably isn't that we really think it's air in his belly because sometimes he'll burp with a puke and the problem is he's extremely hard to burp we just cannot burp him sometimes i can go for minutes and he'll barely let anything out we've tried stomach and moving him everything we can think of and no luck on our legs on our belly shoulder no luck any help if you've switched formula made sure theres nothing in the water then we can assume it's him that's where i'm going to go here my son was really hard to burp too and he had terrible gas as a baby but we always kept going because we didn't want him to barf yuiecch here are a few tips burp frequently even during feeding my son was soley bottle fed and because he got the gas so bad afterwards we burped him every three ounces from an oz bottle or so and that really helped my roomie who had her babe at the same time and had the same problem but breastfed had a bad case of the baby barfs as well and i told her that any time he lets go try to burp him then or before you switch breastesests it worked let gravity help after a large meal dont lay him down right away even if he is sleeping gravity will help him digest his milk and get it to the bottom of his tummy even with the big asss air bubble in there the down side to this tip is that often the air moves with it and thats ok but we all know that lower gas in the tummy is magnificently painful and be prepared to deal with the screaming when he really got going we'd do this bicycle race a little while after eating after gravity has taken its toll when he starts to fuss lay him on his back and push his little feet up to his belly don't worry it won't hurt but be gentle keep doing that and flex his legs like a bicycle and try not to laugh when he farts on your wife keep your chin up kids  Breastfeeding Aerial (dance move) Burping Toilet humour Milk Piccolo Junior Saga Childbirth Baby bottle Professional wrestling throws Diving Care Bears Shaggy dog story Bong Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bart chalkboard gags B-47 Stratojet Trailer Park Boys Professional wrestling attacks Equine conformation Guinea pig Social rule Dairy Cat Siphon Flatulence Coffee Nestl__ Infant Fertility awareness Breech birth Cheese Suplex The Adventures of Pete & Pete Sea-Monkey Infant formula Jam (TV series) Breast milk Little Britain Poker jargon Babe Ruth Snake Milton H.

did you baby eat zucchini or did you have to mix it with another vegetable i make baby food for the families i work for as a nanny and many children find zucchini tasty on its own as it is very milk in flavour the peel itself though tends to be an issue when served mashed alone as it's rougher the problem with the peel seems to vanish when mixed with other fruits and vegetables zucchini eggplant carrots and yams sweet potatoes is a nice mix for baby around months after they've had the savoury and are moving on to sweeter foods also add rice if baby is okay with this texture just mess around with flavours and see what your baby likes zucchini is a great filler in baby foods if you are trying to introduce something new again because it is mild in flavour  French cuisine Dumpling Tofu Cuisine of Africa Japanese cuisine Cuisine of Singapore Food preservation Peruvian cuisine Pancake Carrot Tea Ice cream Bengali cuisine Korean cuisine German cuisine Rice pudding Cuisine of the Southern United States Yam Curry Cuisine of the Philippines Mashed potato Soup Cuisine of Greece Potato Cuisine of Thailand Cuisine of Brazil Cuisine of Denmark Plantain Vegetarian cuisine Beer Polish cuisine Pizza Zucchini Kelantan Vinegar Cuisine of Malaysia Russian cuisine Food Jewish cuisine Apple Domesticated turkey Soul food Yoghurt Cantonese cuisine Chicken soup Chocolate Sushi Vegetarianism Pot Noodle Cuisine of Laos Date Palm Barbecue Soy sauce Root vegetable British cuisine Breakfast Quinoa Mooncake Cake Culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Sauce Chinese cuisine Potato pancakes Fruit Banana Bread Cholent Couscous Healthy eating Kiwifruit Cheese Swedish cuisine Cuisine of Turkey Fish and chips Veganism Roman eating and drinking Sweet potato Potato chips Nabemono Salad Taiwanese cuisine Cha chaan teng Buddhist cuisine Hamburger Hot pot Milk Durian Hangi Sake Japanese New Year Wine Jelly Cuisine of Vietnam

what are your thoughts on young mothers how young is too young iyo i ask because i'm and have a month old i've been extremely lucky in being able to stay home and my landlord has been extremely good to us my husband works for her husband my husband is and is a good provider i still feel like people judge me because of those two things my age and my husbands age i feel so blessed and love being a mom honestly it was sooner than i tought but i felt ready and was extremely lucky that i got pregnant on our first try my son has changed my life around and i never could have imagined loving someone so much how do you feel how old were you when you had your first child and did you plan or did it just happen what are your thoughts on being a mother i must say that teh reason i'm asking is because my niece's mom told me that she was when she had her first and told me something like is way too young i regret having my kid as young as i did and went on to say that my husband is way too old etc it bothered me and it honestly hurt me to hear her say that she regrets her child she's now and already a grandma so the cycle is repeating itself i just didn't feel like typing all of he friend and hubby stuff in i love my husband and although we both have tempers and normal fights like everyone else we kiss and make up and forget anything happened we understand each other and support each other in those tough times im years old and i am about to be a st time mommy in about weeks my husband is and as i read your question it doesnt really matter what others think people are always going to talk talk regardless of the situation wheter its good or bad so dont worry if you are happy with your husband and both of you love each other keep it that way dont let others put you down dont listen to what others have to say about you my husband and i planned this baby we were so eager to become parents and shes almost here my thoughts as a young mommy is that as long as you are married and have a husband that is providing all the needs for mom and baby then everything is fine its when the girl is between years old and doesnt have the fathers child involved then that is pretty disturbing because that is way young be pregnant but just be happy dont listen to others  EastEnders Kodocha Marilyn Monroe Atomic Kitten About a Boy Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Laura Schlessinger Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) Infantilism Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Charmed The Fairly OddParents Social rule Yoko Ono Jon Secada Recurring South Park characters Pitaten Friends The Lovely Bones Jam (TV series) Pok__mon Live!

how should i begin a feeding routine for my son i hear it's better to do that i mean times and quantity of bottles and ounces in each bottle my son was approximately weeks old or maybe a bit older he sort of had a routine but it could be off by almost an hour at times what i did takes patience was push the feed he wanted either forwards or backwards minutes until he was on a schedule ie every hours or hours etc by doing it this way it did not upset him he was still being fed as much and often as he wanted important they are hungry but we managed to manipulate it gently so that he was truly on a schedule it made life so much easier for us also as we were able to know when he would be hungry and have his bottle breast ready and were able to run about and do things much easier he also was very happy about it what i did from early on was write down the time and amount of feed he would have i did this religiously kept a notepad where i would get everything ready then after so many weeks i could see his own pattern of sorts forming that is how i was able to know his need and manipluate it gently to get him on a really great schedule  Breastfeeding A Day in the Life IBM PC compatible Scientology beliefs and practices Bong Boston and Lowell Railroad Fertility awareness CPU design Milton H.

what are some fun educational games to play with my month old son i'm a first time parent and i'm having trouble coming up with new games to play with my son he likes peek a boo and playing with toys but sometimes i'm dumbfounded in coming up with new ways to engage him any help would be greatly appreciated thanks all of you gave great ideas thanks books are the best you can read to him every day for several minutes even two or three times a day there are lots of great books and many of them come in board book form now so you don't have to worry about ripping the pages or chewing on them let him hold the book if he wants to or you can read one book and let him hold another one make it fun and pleasant there are so many books to suggest but jsut go to your local bookstore and get about a dozen he will very shortly end up with a favortie one or two and want you to read that one over and over and over that's how kids learn from repetition you could also get him some stacking nesting blocks that's a good toy for his age or a bucket with holes of shapes in the top that he has to put the shapes through how about some music i like raffi it's kid music that i can listen to over and over without going completely out of my mind puppets can be fun there's no question though that books are the best and really important  About a Boy Social rule Expanded Universe (Star Wars) I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue 1957 World Series Chess terminology Mao (game) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) The Fairly OddParents Avenue Q SpongeBob SquarePants The Ashlee Simpson Show Trigun Scooby-Doo Kodocha John Cage Sesame Street Naruto jutsu Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Marching band Humphrey Bogart Erik Satie Jeopardy!

how much is too much alright i asked a question similar but didn't really get any response my baby ate oz of milk and oz of water which the doctor told me i could give him water in a hour time period and then he'll be starving again in hours my doctor said not to feed him more than oz every feeding but he acts like he is starving with only oz do you think it hurts him for him to eat that much my doctor didn't want him to eat more than oz cuz he didn't want him to spit up alot but he never spits up my baby is weeks sorry forgot to put that also if i stop at oz he starts crying so hard that he choaks on his own salivia but he isn't gaining too much weight actually he barely gains any at all the doctor also said to give him water so that his poop wouldn't be so solid if your baby is hungry feed him think about it this way if you were breastfeeding your son you would have no idea if he was eating oz every three hours or if he was slurping down oz every three hours and when you took your son in for his check up the pediatrician wouldn't even ask you how many oz your son was eating at a feeding he would just check your son's growth rate to make sure he was gaining weight correctly edit i just read your latest additional info if your son isn't gaining weight at weeks and your pediatrician is suggesting you limit your son's nutritional intake you need a new doctor  Breastfeeding Dieting Milk Childbirth Atkins Nutritional Approach Fertility awareness Ron and Fez Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Folic acid Stomach cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Carburetor Obesity Little Britain Protein-energy malnutrition Milton H.

how much do you think a baby should weigh at weeks if they weighed lbs oz when they were born my son is weeks old and he eats alot the doctor told me not to feed him more than oz at at a time but he's not satisfied with that he's so sweet when he's not hungry but lately that's not very often i know it's hunger and not a diaper or being bored nothing satisfies him except food he won't take his pacifier or anything my dad watched him tonight and he ate oz of milk and oz of water which the doctor told me to give him and that finally satisfied him that's alot to eat in a hour time period i don't want to try cereal so please don't tell me it will help fill him up cereal too young can mess up their stomach because they can't digest it completely so i don't know if i should only feed him the oz which seems like i'm starving him but i don't want to overfeed him also he's not overweight the doctor said he's not gaining as much weight as he should he weighs lbs oz at almost months so he's not even gained pounds since he was born i am just looking at my son's baby book he was lbs when he was born and lbs oz at weeks my doctor always said just feed him when he is hungry the baby knows better then we do i think bigger babies don't always gain as much because they already start with some weight yes there are one or two times when he over ate and threw up but for the most part he knows i would say just feed him when he wants it that is a lot to eat in hours but is that every hours or that one time my son goes through spurts when he eats a lot and then slows down for a day or two there were days when i feell like i just sat around feeding him all day one bottle after another without any break it does slow down he is now months and about lbs he eats solids two times a day and has about oz bottles and usually one smaller one good luck  Breastfeeding Obesity Garfield Binge eating disorder Milk Dieting Sea-Monkey Adjustable gastric band Elephant Ben Johnson (athlete) Stomach cancer Social rule Humphrey Bogart Fasting Atkins Nutritional Approach Blue Whale Piccolo Junior Saga Fecal incontinence Little Britain Pound Anorexia nervosa Kodocha Gastroparesis Urinary incontinence Hamster Coeliac disease Guinea pig Terri Schiavo Childbirth Foie gras Domestic rabbit Diarrhea Breakfast Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Contender (television series) Mixed martial arts Domestic goat Hunger Shen Gong Wu Homer Simpson Bread Hansel und Gretel Paragliding Drawn Together Kangaroo Infant The Amazing Race Great White Shark Pregnancy Shaggy dog story Fugu Chocolate The Apprentice 2 Ron and Fez Koala Albatross Cheese Infant formula Giant Panda Little Shop of Horrors Weight Capercaillie Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma David Blaine Fancy rat Brown Bear Tooth Singlish Dairy Breakfast cereal Banana Kosher foods Pizza Chinese New Year Cattle Food The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Rationing in the United Kingdom during and after World War II Kitten Make money fast Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?

baby sleeping tips my m onth old refuses to sleep any where else but with me it takes me minutes a night getting him to sleep and thats only if hes actually sleepy and hes still waking up to be fed i feed him more at night to keep him full but nothing works do you have any tips on getting him to sleep and keeping him asleep i do use baby cereal and it doesnt work it's nice to be wanted so much by someone isn't it it's hard to say no to someone who obviously loves and needs you but that's what you need to do spend more time outside in the afternoon that will make him sleepy establish a bedtime routine so he knows what's coming and is ready to go to bed i always read to my children sometimes sitting by their bed to read to them after they were in bed an mo old may not understand the story but he enjoys hearing you talk he isn't waking because he's hungry he's waking out of habit because he knows you'll come when he cries at night check to be sure he isn't in pain or wet then put him back to bed you may have to listen to him cry for a few nights but he will get the idea that you're not going to pick him up until morning  Shaggy dog story Avenue Q The Amber Spyglass Sleep The Shining (film) The Catcher in the Rye Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Characters in the Smurfs Futurama (TV series - season 5) Mattress Ron and Fez Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Daylight saving time Knots Landing The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Apollo 8 Urinary incontinence Odyssey Jon Secada Bon Jovi Delayed sleep phase syndrome Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind About a Boy Narcolepsy Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Patrick Star Breastfeeding Out-of-body experience Humphrey Bogart Hansel und Gretel Miss Saigon Milton H.

ok i will try another catagory to list question in dr did internal exam today need help understand what he need help understanding what he ment please posted in pregnancy catagory and didnt get much intrest so im trying new born cuz all you moms have just been in my shoes thanks in advace ok well the dr keeps bouncing back and forth as to how far along i am he says weeks one week the next any who here is my question i had an internal exam today to see if i was dialated or anything he said that your cervice starts out at inchecs thick and mine is now about and inches thick and i have lost about inch does this mean that my cervics is efacing he also said my cervics is closed i asume that is no dialation but that he can put a finger in there and feel the babys head he is going on vacation for a week but said when he gets back that he will rough me up to get things moving does that mean that he will strip membranes or something i would have asked all this to him but i was not really dumbfounded until i got home and started thinking about what he had said any opinions are aprecated what do you make of this thanks to the two who answered already its aprecated just wanted a few more opinions additional details second ago i guess you would have to know the dr to understand his sence of humor the rough you up comment is just him he is really a good dr i really like him and would not change i just had a dumb moment and didnt understand what he ment exactly thanks you're right about everything you thought effacement is change in the thickness of the cervix so from what your doctor said you're about effaced you will eventually get to effaced but this sometimes happens during labor as you dilate the dilatation is just as you said it's when the cervix starts to open up so closed means no dilatation yet the fact that he can get his finger in to touch the baby's head means that your cervix is getting soft and he can slide the finger up there softening of the cervix is the beginning of the ripening of the cervix in preparation for dilatation this is normal for your stage of pregnancy i would say that roughing you up is your doctor's humorous way of describing stripping your membranes doctors do this because this is believed to release prostaglandins a type of hormone that will help to continue to ripen soften the cervix the cervix needs to be nice and soft in order to dilate so that's why they do this some people are against doctors stripping membranes because it's uncomfortable for the woman and doesn't allow the process to occur naturally but it does often help to move things along toward labor hope this helps  Childbirth Pregnancy Cervix Abortion Intact dilation and extraction Breech birth Fertility awareness Prostate cancer Gonorrhoea Cancer Obstetrics Abortion debate Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Gynaecology Menstrual cycle Human papillomavirus Fast bowling Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Friends Strap-on dildo Cervical cancer Theory of conduct Signal transduction Breastfeeding Wound healing phases Shaggy dog story Volleyball In vitro fertilisation Humphrey Bogart Intersex surgery Stenberg v.

babys head my month old is pulling up and he thinks he's invincible he lossed his balance and fell back on a bucket this happend about minutes ago i just felt the back of his head and theirs a big not back there should i be worried i wouldn't worry try icing it and take him to the doc tomorrow if the lump doesn't go down here is some info from babycenter com what's a concussion when a closed head injury meaning one in which no object penetrates the skull causes a change in the normal functioning of the brain it's called a concussion the injury might be from a violent blow a fall or a severe shaking a child with a concussion may lose consciousness or have problems with his vision memory or balance this sounds scary but in most cases the effects are minor and temporary and the child recovers completely my baby fell and hit his head how can i tell if he has a concussion your baby may have one or more of these early symptoms loss of consciousness drowsiness dizziness confusion vomiting irritability drainage clear or bloody from his nose mouth or ears when should i call if your baby hits his head and starts breathing irregularly has convulsions or is unconscious more than a few minutes call for immediate help don't move him unless he's in danger of being hurt further perform cpr if he isn't breathing and if he's bleeding cover the wound with a clean cloth and apply pressure when should i call the doctor it's common for babies to hit their heads when they fall and in most cases there's nothing to worry about if your baby loses consciousness though have him checked out by his doctor or by the doctor at the emergency room sometimes even with a minor blow the brain can be injured also take your baby to a doctor right away if he hits his head and in the next day or two he is vomiting it's okay to have a bout of vomiting after a fall but it shouldn't persist seems unusually sleepy during the day or can't be awakened at night try waking your baby a couple of times the first night after his fall just to make sure you can seems weak or confused or seems to have problems with coordination vision or verbal communication can a concussion cause permanent brain damage only in rare cases but a second concussion before symptoms from the first one have cleared can be dangerous possibly causing brain damage and even death so if your baby has suffered a concussion that caused him to lose consciousness your doctor will probably advise you to keep an extra watchful eye on him for the next few weeks how can i prevent my baby from getting a concussion the best thing you can do is to childproof your home also make sure your child is always safely buckled into his safety seat in the car  Drowning Hypoglycemia Urinary incontinence Hyperthermia Epilepsy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Equine conformation Stroke Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Myocardial infarction Bleeding Electroconvulsive therapy Cephalic disorder Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Breech birth Stomach cancer Sleep M__ni__re___s disease Dehydration Motorcycle helmet Childbirth Intracranial pressure Milton H.

tips for weaning month old baby from breastfeeding it's time for me to start weaning my little sweetie start regulating the time spent breastfeeding if your baby is on a schedule this will be easier but if not you may want to just decide on a certain amount of time that she will breastfeed for example minutes choose a time of day to eliminate breastfeeding first for example after nap cut down the time that your baby nurses by a few minutes every other day and offer a snack instead of the last minutes of nursing or a bit of formula babies should have formula if they are not breastfeeding up to age yr eventually cut the time down to no nursing and offer the bottle of formula instead or a snack or baby food do this with each session of breastfeeding that you normally do during the day and night it will take probably a month to completely wean but this way it is not so dramatic for baby and you don't end up painfully full of milk because you have gradually tapered off  Breastfeeding Infant formula Fertility awareness Infant Childbirth Baby bottle Elimination communication International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Milk Protein-energy malnutrition Nipple Nestl__ Nestl__ boycott Prolactin Vitamin D Elephant Mastitis Nipple piercing Breast milk Hamster Cat Dorama Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Formula One Co-sleeping Indianapolis 500 Kitten Sleep Dialysis Blue Whale Carrot Ice cream Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Breakfast The Amazing Race Pregnancy Brassiere Bob Dylan (album) The Super Milk-chan Show Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Formula One regulations Breast pump Jaundice Drill bit Domestic goat Leaf Knots Landing Red Hot Chili Peppers Empire Burlesque Bringing It All Back Home Nursing Tooth Harp Seal Future of Formula One Billboard Hot 100 HIV Breast The Coca-Cola Company Prolactinoma BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban GED EastEnders Tiny Toon Adventures Haloperidol Urinary incontinence Marathon (sport) The Beatles discography Pet skunk Koala Second Battle of the Atlantic Champagne (beverage) Soybean Nurse Highway 61 Revisited Characters in the Smurfs Docosahexaenoic acid History of corsets Alex Ferguson Craps Situation comedy Chopsticks Eid ul-Fitr The Apprentice 2 Education in Portugal Glucocorticoid Roxette Soy milk Tea Social rule Bee Neighbours National Football League Lore Trans fat Kibbutz International response to Hurricane Katrina The Apprentice 1 Bah__'u'll__h Ron and Fez The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe

why can't some people remember when they were babies most people shouldnt rememember when they were babies the hippocampus which encodes declarative memory memories that you are aware you have unlike procedural memory such as learning how to walk or crawl does not fully develop until after age a lot of people believe they have genuine memories from their infancy but these memories are usually constructed later in their childhood after they have looked at pictures of themselves these constructed memories often seem more real than genuine memories and are often the basis of child abuse and molestation cases  Memory Episodic memory Hippocampus False memory Sexual abuse Infant Dissociative identity disorder Child Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Hypnosis Long-term memory Mental retardation Semantic memory Eric R.

what's your opinion formula vs breast what if formula was prescribed by a doctor think of the possibility insurance companies would pay for the bulk of the cost formula would be used only on a need basis just a momentary thought i know that a lot of you won't like the idea if the doctor won't write a prescripiton you go to another doctor another thought the uninsured have title for pregnancies and babies in some countries this is the norm formula is available but only by 'script i don't think it's difficult for a mom to get one but in places like norway and sweden it's made the bf'ing rates skyrocket however a policy like that would have to go hand in hand with a complete overhaul of maternity leave women would need to be able to take up to a year without fear of losing their job or be able to have in house daycare at their work w breaks for bf'ing for example it's an interesting idea but i doubt it would ever fly in the us  Publicly funded medicine Abortion Insurance Breastfeeding Health insurance Unemployment Life insurance Childbirth US health reform 1912-1920 Kurt G__del Inflation EastEnders Obesity Abortion in the United States Eugenics Health care in the United States Nuclear warfare Professor Conscription American individualist anarchism Medical malpractice Wal-Mart Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Teenage pregnancy Canadian and American health care systems compared Keynesian economics Abortion debate Public domain Norway national football team Infant Economy of Norway Microeconomics Fertility awareness US health reform under FDR Plame affair ITunes Music Store Centrelink Roe v.

what to do with month old cont'd well i have recently trying rice cereal feeding him it around lunch time a time when he is quite happy since i follow him on how the day goes around his up and downs he recently passed little hard terds along with soft stool is this caused from rice cereal he is strictly breast fed so i find it weird p s how come you can not reply to other people answers to your questions yes the cereal is what's binding him up it happens to all babies when you introduce solid foods which obviously are of a much different consistency than breast milk you can do a couple of things make the cereal runnier and mix it with your breast milk lots so it's looser and easier on his gut to digest quit with the boxed cereals and make him homemade rice cereal from organic brown rice soak the rice first overnight and use like a ration of rice to water or more you can make a small pot and refrigerate it and use it over time get a handheld babyfood grinder and use it to grind up the rice or oats or barley he will love this and it's so much better for him nutritionally do you remember what it feels like to be so constipated that your poop comes out in little hard turds not a good feeling is it if the constipation continues you can mix a little bit of barley malt into his cereal as barley malt is a very gentle sweetener that has a slight laxative effect  Coeliac disease Fecal incontinence Diarrhea Tofu Cereal Bread Milk Dietary fiber Porridge Breakfast cereal Rice Coffee Breakfast Food Laxative Barley Kosher foods Tea Toilet humour Stomach cancer Rice pudding MRE Ice cream Infant formula Gluten Beer Soy milk Flour Vinegar Single malt Scotch Feces Cuisine of Denmark Lactose intolerance Breast milk Agriculture Idli Dairy Flatulence Jewish cuisine Constipation Quaker Oats Company Cheese Cuisine of the Philippines Chocolate Soft drink Ovaltine Wheat Peruvian cuisine Veganism Brewery Folic acid Soybean Botulism Crohn's disease Adjustable gastric band Nutrition Nestl__ Alcoholic beverage Chicken Chicken soup Nestl__ boycott Oat Food preservation Rice Krispies Cuisine of Brazil Yoghurt Capercaillie Organic food Soup Norman Borlaug Customs and etiquette of Japan Urinary incontinence Tocopherol Starch Vermicompost Happy Meal Crop rotation Ramen Theory of conduct Natt__ Whisky Fertility awareness Hamster Bran Social rule Chili con carne Soy protein Economy of the People's Republic of China Miso Raw food diet Genericized trademark Bengali cuisine Chronic fatigue syndrome Piccolo Junior Saga Fancy rat

what to do with my month old son st time mom in need of help well my son is on a routine of feeding every hours napping every hours for an hour to half our at a time usually wakes to eat after a nap his has bed time routine around bed by sleeps until usually wakes a couple times in the night to be givin a soother again sometimes to eat depends on the night he use to go to bed at and sleep untill but without so many wakings however it seemed like was beginning to be too late he was getting fussy around he would have an enjoyable bath then but it was always a fight for pjs and would fuss and cry until he got fed and the would go to bed at so we changed his bed time to bed time routine is alot more pleasurable but now have early mornings with night wakings what would be a good schedule is he not napping enough or too much whats a good bed time should i space him to hour feedings anthing i am big on schedule p s i am not into letting him cry him self back to sleep when my daughter was around months she went through a stage when her sleep patterns went beserk she had been a great little sleeper sleeping for hours at a time and hours up during the day and sleeping hours at night un broken apparently babies go through a growth spurt at around months my daughters whole routine went out the window she would wake screaming after minutes and her long sleeps were minutes day and night this lasted around weeks and just as quick as it started it stopped she returned to a lovely routine since then she didn't seem to need as much sleep as she had been having and i decided to let her try to find a routine i gave her days and in that time i picked up on her little signs i was able to catch her at the first sign of being tired and put her down then otherwise she quickly became overtired and it was a real battle to get her to sleep i kept a sleep chart just a table of sleeptimes feed times etc and was able to work out from there a routine that suited us both she is now months old goes to bed at pm sleeps hours wakes at am and has either two hour sleeps a day or sometimes just sleep of maybe hours i refused point blank to let her cry herself to sleep but there is a difference between screaming and her whinging sorry i can't think of a better word it is a really tired murmer type cough i would suggest talking to a lactation consultant about changing his feeding routine even if you bottle feed they are really great they know all about feeding routines and amounts my daughters routine used to be a bath before bed but i found this would wake her up to much i tried taking her in the shower with me i believe that the constant cuddles and reassurance was able to relax her alot she now prefers a shower and if you want to stick to a routine go for it your child will need to get used to a routine later in life anyway so you are just paving the way for an easier transition good luck  Breastfeeding Sleep Mattress The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Urinary incontinence Shaggy dog story Sin City Daylight saving time Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Apollo 8 Avenue Q Polyphasic sleep Fertility awareness Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Futurama (TV series - season 5) Childbirth USS Yorktown (CV-10) The Shining (film) The Contender (television series) Episodes of Lost (Season 2) The Amber Spyglass The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Oasis (band) Spice Girls Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) USS Wasp (CV-18) Teen Girl Squad Donald Neilson Milton H.

i just went thru c section months now my baby is on my feed totally i feel a lot hungry n i am hogging my doubt is what ever i hog gets converted into milk or will it add as my weight coz i already grew kgs so further weight gain is not a pleasant thought can some one guide me okay every one tells you that breastfeeding helps loose weight right well thats not entirely true while it does burn more than calories a day if you are eating more than you burn then the weight won't come off and you will actually gain weight i went through and am going through the same thing i had a c section and still look pregnant at months and that it with running miles a day my suggestion is to drink water first plus water is actually what helps you produce milk what you eat will not be converted into milk but it can have an effect on how it tastes just like eating curries make your sweat smell different and then decide if you are hungary lastest studies have shown that you don't need to add more food to your diet be smart about what you are eating also depending on your fitness level don't do anything that will make the incision worse make sure you are walking alot i just started running before that i just walked everyday it may not take the weight of but it keeps you stable and prevents more weight gain and you feel better  Breastfeeding Milk Dieting Atkins Nutritional Approach Tooth Fecal incontinence Obesity Super Size Me Chocolate Anorexia nervosa Tofu Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fasting Oily fish Egg (food) Garfield Cuisine of Malaysia Cheese Weight training Dairy Soy milk Aspartame Coeliac disease Friends Sugar substitute Social rule Omega-3 fatty acid Nutrition Little Britain Prostate cancer Bong Coconut crab Vegetarianism Stomach cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tocopherol Garlic Curry Water Tea Veganism Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Hypoglycemia Family farm hog pen Vitamin D Soft drink The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Bodybuilding Healthy eating Ham Low-carbohydrate diet Adjustable gastric band Hyperglycemia Pig 613 mitzvot Diarrhea Colorectal cancer Acne Humphrey Bogart Insulin RuneScape quests Protein-energy malnutrition Vampire Diabetes mellitus Pregnancy Guinea pig Clinical depression Elephant Agriculture Trailer Park Boys The Contender (television series) Domestic goat Local food Organic food Breast milk Kashrut Explosive material Fertility awareness Domestic rabbit Food Tlingit Alcoholic beverage Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Indianapolis 500 Breakfast Sage Japanese tea ceremony EastEnders Coffee Cuisine of Denmark Raw food diet Dietary fiber Red Hot Chili Peppers Photosynthesis Jet engine Ron and Fez

baby walkers why do some people still think they are a good idea there is so much recent evidence today that baby walkers are so bad for babies development they actually delay walking not encourage it and they result in many more referrals to physiotherapists for walking problems including walking on tip toes they are also dangerous as an immobile baby is suddenly given wheels and speed without the developmental maturity to deal with her environment the same goes for baby door bouncers both are sadly used too often as passive babysitters the best place for babies to learn to walk is lying on the floor there he can roll around and learn to explore his environment safely using the right muscles at the right time in his development why are some people still putting their babies in these things and expecting them to use muscles that are just not ready yet i suspect due to lack of info why also i have to ask are these things still sold in the shops given the mounting evidence please look at the link below before answering http www bliss org uk pagebuild php texttype whatsnew babywalkers paper thanks for your answers so far i know not everyone uses them for hours on end but what i don't get is the misplaced notion that they encourage children to walk when they don't and i think the fact that this has been said for years and they are still on sale is worrying particularly as evidence is mounting the cost to the nhs must also be quantifiable due to physiotherapy referrals and gp time some countries have banned them i think the uk should consider doing the same i think given the relationship between a e referrals and baby walkers and the medical difficulties amongst others it is clear that there are safety issues with them the problem is also that they are misused and babies are not properly supervised when in them given the misguided notion that many people have that they will encourage walking that in itself can indicate that those parents may infact think that spending longer periods of time in them is beneficial i would like to see far more information and guidance given to parents if they are to continue to be sold i see where you are all coming from i am a mum too and although i didn't use a walker i used a bouncer for my son purely for his own entertainment as he loved the sensation so please don't think i am just getting at you all i realise that we can find risk everywhere and that there is a need to allow our children room to make mistakes but when it comes to babies safety i'm sorry but i just don't think this can be taken lightly i don't think this is about making our babies think they are the centre of the world they already are babies don't fit to you you fit to them you have to for the first wee while anyway thanks again for all your answers that's what i love about this forum you always get food for thought which i have i think the theme running throughout the answers is that people those who have answered are using these things responsibly with plenty of awareness of their baby's needs and assessments of their safety which is fine as i said earlier i also used a door bouncer as brief entertainment for my son but the majority of time he was on the floor that is reflected in your answers the basic problem is lack of information the kind of parents who will leave their child in these things unaided are perhaps not going to spend their time on yahoo answers or indeed even have access to the internet as a social worker i have seen parents with very poor attitudes parents who really don't have the capacity to consider these points and weigh up risks etc given that there is no info on the box with regards to these concerns the problems will continue floor time is the essential element the report is not saying that if your child so much as puts a foot in one of these things they will be delayed answerers who say their child was fine also add that they made sure their child played a lot on the floor and was only in it for brief periods lets understand that there are those who leave their babies in them far too long and then these problems develop and i am a mother as i said i am all for getting minutes to yourself and for allowing children to take risks i agree that if we read every report and took it at face value we wouldn't ever leave the house i feel strongly about that too and have a very balanced view of these things eg my son got the mmr jab years ago i suppose because i have seen the damage that lack of stimulation can have on children first hand that these things perhaps hit home more but seriously thanks for your responses and honesty funnily enough my oldest three kids who are all teenagers now used baby walkers and developed normally walked unaided on time or even a tad on the early side and have had no developmental problems at all my toddler now didn't use one and she walked unaided right when the so called experts said she should and she is also perfectly normal perhaps in this research as in the case of the study of thousands of women who had morning sickness which showed that of women with morning sickness have girls the corellation is so small as to be negligible i mean had boys but the researchers still jumped up and down and told everyone that if you have morning sickness you are more likely to have a girl oh well no point in me doing the research at this point my older kids are fine and dandy and so is the baby and the issue of to walker or not to walker is moot edit to add there are plenty of kids who have developmental issues who have never used a walker or a bouncer considering this and the fact that there are plenty of kids who have used them who don't have any problems if i were to have to make a decision tomorrow as to whether or not to let a baby be in a walker i would wonder at the legitimacy of the research and probably just use the danged walker  Androgen insensitivity syndrome Infantilism Fathers' rights Little Britain Abortion

co sleeping i got into the habbit of letting my baby sleep with me its easier since im breastfeeding now she is months part of me wants to put her in her crib but i heard that co sleeping can reduce the rick of sids source dr sears practicing pediatrician in answer to a question about co sleeping a don't worry continue co sleeping because i have thoroughly researched this common concern and written two books on the subject the baby sleep book and sids a parent's guide to understanding and preventing sudden infant death syndrome i feel that i can confidently advise you on this subject in the sids book you'll find more than scientific references to support the information provided on sleep and breathing patterns and safe sleeping arrangements also my wife and i co slept with every one of our eight babies and i have advocated the practice throughout my years of being a pediatrician i've come to the conclusion that co sleeping if practiced wisely and safely can actually lower the risk of sids and here's why co sleeping helps your baby rouse himself new research has shown that in most cases sids is caused by a baby's inability to arouse himself from sleep normally when something occurs that threatens your baby's well being such as difficulty breathing he will automatically wake up for reasons that are still unknown in some babies this protective mechanism does not go off and so these babies are more at risk for sids this is where the positive aspects of co sleeping come in dr james mckenna director of the mother baby sleep laboratory and professor of anthropology at the university of notre dame has conducted numerous studies of mothers and babies who were co sleeping and night nursing his group of researchers found that mom and baby share similar patterns of sleep arousals what we call nighttime harmony they drifted in and out of sleep stages in a similar but not always identical pattern some sids researchers believe that this is a factor in baby's protective arousal mechanism this harmony may also be related to a psychological synchronicity between co sleeping mothers and their babies the co sleeping mom is more likely to subconsciously sense if her baby's health is in danger and wake up researchers also believe that the carbon dioxide you exhale when you sleep close to your baby may help stimulate her breathing plus co sleeping infants tend to automatically sleep on their back in order to have easier access to nighttime feedings back sleeping has proved to be one of the top risk reducers for sids meanwhile babies who sleep separately from their moms have been shown to experience a decrease in the amount of rem sleep the state of sleep in which protective arousal is the most likely to occur co sleeping is a common practice worldwide the rate of sids is lowest in cultures that traditionally share sleep such as asian while there could be many other factors contributing to the lower incidence of sids in these cultures all the population studies i've seen have come to the same conclusion safe co sleeping lowers the sids risk co sleeping warnings are based on imprecise science i began my pediatric career in academic medicine and teaching in university hospitals at that time i learned an important lesson about scientific research when the conclusions of a scientific study and common sense don't match suspect faulty science both dr mckenna's writings and my two books mentioned above contain information that proves the original studies that triggered the alarm about co sleeping were flawed in addition scientists have yet to come to a universal agreement on the definition of co sleeping i've always considered co sleeping to mean bed sharing or sleeping within arm's reach of mother however it can also be defined as simply being close to mom or sleeping in the parents' bedroom no matter your interpretation you will find general agreement among all sids researchers pediatricians and the american academy of pediatrics that sleeping in the same room with parents lowers the risk of sids co sleeping is as safe as the conditions you practice for obvious reasons parents under the influence of alcohol drugs or medications that interfere with normal sleep patterns should never have their baby in their bed other safeguards to employ sleep in a king size bed if possible to give everybody enough room be sure there are no wide crevices between the mattress and the guardrail or headboard that your baby's head could sink into never allow infants to sleep in the same bed with siblings or

just curious ok now i know you aren't suppose to have sex until after the week check up but i didn't have any stitches and was also done bleeding about a week after i had my son sorry if that's to much info my husband and i had sex with out a condom i know not the best idea i am also nursing and well i was told by the health nurse that for at least months while exclusively breastfeeding that it could be used instead of a condom or birth control i personally don't like that idea and wouldn't use it on a regular basis but i guess what i am asking is why do you hear about some people being pregnant at their week check up and they are nursing but then you hear it can be used kinda as a form of birth control as i really wouldn't want to be pregnant so soon after having my son thanks for you answers in advance everyone's telling you to use birth control but the two kinds of birth control pill are actually bad for breastfeeding moms though the companies who make them tell you otherwise they tend to deplete your milk supply i know it happened to me and the lactation consultant informed me that according to an independent study done by a curious doctor the majority of women saw a severe decrease in their milk supply when taking the mini pill so i breastfed both of my kids and planned my second pregnancy and now my third pregnancy around breastfeeding yes some women still get pregnant while breastfeeding so it's not a sure fire birth control method however combined with condoms your chances are that much lower breastfeeding does suppress ovulation when you are exclusively not pumping as the pump does not do nearly as an effective job as a baby suckling breastfeeding all day and all night at least times during the night as stated before some women are different your nurse mentioned months because that's when solids are typically introduced and baby doesn't exclusively nurse which may start ovulation up it is also said that even though you have a period while breastfeeding you still may not ovulate everyone is different i believe i am just now starting to ovulate as my periods are coming closer together due to my son cutting back to nursings a day this is after months and i am still not pregnant it's said the pull out method isn't effective but we stopped using condoms while ago after we went into the if it happens it happens stage i also make sure to urinate after every sexcapade to flush any thing that could have gotten up there this also helps keep away uti's basically if you don't want to get pregnant take precautions  Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Birth control Oral contraceptive Childbirth Emergency contraception Folic acid Urinary incontinence Condom EastEnders Herpes simplex virus Abortion debate Prostate cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Knots Landing Safe sex Haloperidol Endometriosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prolactin Sexual abstinence AIDS Humphrey Bogart Premature birth Friends Guinea pig Psoriasis In vitro fertilisation Oral sex Infant Doxepin Medical analysis of circumcision Kodocha Prolactinoma Tocopherol Sex education Cytomegalovirus Elephant Gonorrhoea Miscarriage Maprotiline Polycystic ovary syndrome History of sex HIV Stomach cancer Nipple Paroxetine Theory of conduct Hiberno-English Puberty Infant formula Shaggy dog story Nipple piercing Acne Little Britain Boston Public Depo Provera Twin Progesterone Niddah Prenatal diagnosis The Inside Survivor (novel) Pregnancy test Heracles Sharon Tate CPU cache Dairy Horus Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Kender Melanie Wilkes Milton H.

about bowel movement my month old baby is not passing motion for three days tried prune juice what should i do hi as this has been going on for a few days i would see your gp health visitor or ask your pharmacist for advice if this happens regularly the it is possible that your baby may not be absorbing the vitamins and minerals needed which are essential for growing there is probably a hour pharmacy near you when my son had a similar problem i used a couple of teaspoons of fresh orange juice and diluted it with water three four bottles throughout the day along with his usual formula did the trick and i was advised to stop food for a short while by my health visitor until he had a bowel movement at seven months your are perhaps begining to add new foods to your babies diet your babies body needs to get use to dealing with these this could cause constipation if your baby is constipated she he probably will not want to eat much as her his tummy will be full as long as your baby is drinking their milk and bottles of juice a day this is not a major problem at months for a couple of days i would suggest that you give a little amount or no food for a day and just give fluids water weak juice and breast or formula milk after all babies do get most of their essential vitamins etc from their milk in the first year i notice that in response to previous questions you have asked that people have suggested bulking your baby up on rice cereal and such things added to their i do not know whether you have followed this advice but please do not add these thing to your babys bottle as this can cause choking and constipation as your baby will not be getting enough fluids unless they are drinking lots of water too as this would be like your baby is having another meal rather than a drink my son loved avocado sweet potato and adding pureed fruit to his meal has kept his bowel movements fine since i hope that this helps  Fecal incontinence Milk Veganism Diarrhea Coeliac disease Folic acid Nutrition Breakfast Food Dietary fiber Soft drink Urinary incontinence Stomach cancer Vitamin C Fasting Coffee Hamster Soy milk Peruvian cuisine Tocopherol Wine Vitamin Tea Crohn's disease Cuisine of the Philippines Cuisine of Denmark Soybean Vitamin D Guinea pig Cuisine of Brazil Medical prescription Cuisine of Africa Hypoglycemia Nestl__ Healthy eating Tofu Potassium Russian cuisine Drink Cuisine of Malaysia Japanese tea ceremony Aloe Jewish cuisine Yoghurt Chocolate Laxative Raw food diet Pet skunk Egg (food) Chlorpromazine Pomegranate Organic food Rum Swedish cuisine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Happy Meal Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Potato Food guide pyramid Prostate cancer Bread Lemon Beer Omega-3 fatty acid Polychlorinated biphenyl Vegetarian nutrition Bong German cuisine Breakfast cereal Rice Dialysis Hemorrhoid Irritable bowel syndrome Botulism Little Britain Sea-Monkey Patent medicine Domestic rabbit French cuisine Chronic fatigue syndrome Dairy Cheese Multiple sclerosis Tomato Sake

why do so many people feed their babies formula dont they realize that breast milk is the best thing for your child personally i thing its lazyness cause it is much easier to give a baby a bottle im not saying im better than anyone i jsut see people my friends included using formula because they 'cant' breast feed what would they have done before formula came along i bet they would have tried alittle harder to breast feed and im not a stay at home mom yet i'm weeks pregnant and plan to feed my baby the right way ok so out of the billions of people in this world there might be some who have a good medical reason to not breast feed but for the most part woman these days are too concerned with what they want to do rather than what they should do it just bothers me because i was out with a friend who does breastfeed and my year old stepdaughter didnt know that was how babies eat she thought they ate out of a bottle i didnt realize that no one ever told her its pretty sad that we have to tell people thats how babies eat tina you and your doctor are uneducated idiots when it comes to breastfeeding and bilirubin levels maybe you should do some research on that issue before you give out facts that are untrue rather then have the nerve to tell people to research it or to have an open mind your breast milk was harming him lmao that has to be the funniest and stupidest thing i have heard this year it's really sad that your doctor is not educated on breastfeeding and to even suggest that your breast milk could harm your baby is ludicrous slightly raised bilirubin levels are always prolonged in breastfed infants and it causes no harm if you or your doctor were more educated on the issue you would know this just so you know not all doctors are up to date on their information this is a fact they don't know everything and don't suggest the best things at times this question probably wouldn't make you so upset unless you feel guilty somewhere deep down about choosing to formula feed yes i said choosing get a clue  Fertility awareness Infant Breast Childbirth Infant formula Pregnancy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infantilism Jaundice Milk International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Abortion debate Folic acid Nestl__ boycott Friends Kodocha Social rule Nestl__ Stuttering Knots Landing Prolactinoma Urinary incontinence Sharon Tate Humphrey Bogart Transsexuality Vitamin D Adoption Hypoglycemia Breast pump Jon Secada Drawn Together Ron and Fez Baby bottle Androgen insensitivity syndrome Characters in the Smurfs Domestic violence Theodicy Cytomegalovirus Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Breast cancer Have I Got News For You Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Little Britain Alcoholics Anonymous Milton H.

my month old son spends all his naps in the stroller for one month i was able to get my son to nap in the crib months of age then he developed a yeast infection on his face weeks ago and then i could no longer get him down it would take hours on off so i would just give up and take him out for a car ride stroller ride now he spends all his naps in the stroller i find he sleeps much better than in the crib he used to only sleep minutes in the crib but will sleep hrs in the stroller i park it in the front hallway after he falls asleep my question is is this a bad habit to get into when it takes little time for him to fall asleep in the stroller but ages in the crib the basic rule i found with my son when he was an infant was that everything is a phase he would do these things that i didn't understand but try not to fight it when my son was an newborn he wouldn't sleep anywhere but on my chest it was a really hard stage to go through then when he was about months old he was actually willing to sleep on his own but he would only sleep in our bed now he is and he sleeps all night on his own in his own room all night long i found that if you try to force it it becomes something that your little guy is going to get stressed over and then it becomes an issue just go with it never give up trying to get him down in his crib but if it causes him stress it's your job to alleviate that stress and make him comfortable you need to build that trust in him and let him know that you're going to be there for him and rescue him he'll eventually go to sleep in his crib or in his bed plus if it gives you a two hour break go with it and take time to get that much needed relaxation  Sleep Sudden infant death syndrome Narcolepsy Childbirth Mattress Urinary incontinence Baby transport Public transport Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story Social rule Polyphasic sleep Time Lucid dreaming Co-sleeping Extreme Programming Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Cat Sleep debt Insomnia Delayed sleep phase syndrome Bombe Characters in the Smurfs Apollo 8 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Equine conformation Avenue Q Herpes simplex virus The Shining (film) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Sleep disorder Knots Landing Rapid eye movement Infant Infantilism Humphrey Bogart Kurt Cobain Daylight saving time Traumatic brain injury Days of our Lives Out-of-body experience W.I.T.C.H.

my five and a half month old refuses to eat veggies she does eat her cereal what should i do i do not have any children but i do have three nephews the youngest one is months and when he was first introduced to baby food he would act like he liked it one day and then the next he wouldn't take one bite of the same stuff and usually he isn't that interested in trying anything too different i think your baby probably is just surprised by the change and not interested at the time give it a little break and try later and try to give it her at a time when she's very smiley i find this is the easiest time to get them excited about something new but if months go by and no improvement you should probably consult a pediatrition  MRE The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Kodocha Breastfeeding Breakfast cereal Piccolo Junior Saga Breakfast Hey Jude Elephant Burger King Fecal incontinence Social rule Knots Landing Giant Panda Comanche Childbirth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cheerios Folic acid Vegetarianism John Harvey Kellogg Characters in the Smurfs Mnemonic Gluten-free, casein-free diet Snack food Theory of conduct Fasting Hera Terri Schiavo Nestl__ Humphrey Bogart Melanie Wilkes Coeliac disease Bread Smiley Smile EastEnders The Beach Boys Eddie Guerrero Jon Secada Neighbours Passover Liberal Party of Canada leadership convention, 1968 Pet Sounds Characters of Lost Vegetarian cuisine Friends Infant formula Tasmanian Devil Sesame Street Bat Boy Avenue Q Cliff Richard Messerschmitt Bf 109 The McGuire Sisters Ron and Fez Mental Health Act 1983 John the Baptist Pet skunk Domestic rabbit Siege of Antioch VeggieTales Popeye Late Night with Conan O'Brien Shark Green Revolution I Want to Hold Your Hand Charmed Neopets Invader Zim Hall & Oates Jam (TV series) Kimberly-Clark Corporation Food and Drug Administration London Congestion Charge Anorexia nervosa End of Han Dynasty Wild Honey Pregnancy 613 mitzvot Cereal Food Stamp Program Toronto Blue Jays Kender Aston Villa F.C.

flying baby i am taking my son who is months on a plane this month and i was wondering if anyone knew the regulations as far as carrying on formula bottled water etc are they pretty strict about it i've been flying internationally and domestically with my children since they were months now here are some tips and advice that have always worked for me and i hope will help you you will need to have all your son's documents in order it is a good idea to keep a copy of his notarized birth certificate with you verify what travel documents you will need in advance to make sure you have everything faa regulations currently allow children under the age of two to fly free of charge as lap children not required to have their own seat you will need to inform the airline ahead of time that you will have a small infant traveling with you the flight attendants should place you in a front seat where you will have more room because of the length of flight the flight attendants should also give you a bassinet that attaches to the front wall to put your child in however you can not uses this during taxi take offs landings or turbulence this is not the safest way for a child to fly and the airlines recommend children to have their own seat with a child safety device i advise using a crs child restraint system because it is safe for the child especially during turbulence makes them feel secure is more comfortable for both parent and child and gives both of you the opportunity to relax a bit a crs is a hard backed child safety seat car seat that is approved by the government for use in both motor vehicles and aircraft in order to be certified for use on an airplane the car seat has to met the federal motor vehicle safety standards check the labels on the side of your car restraint for a sticker words will be printed in red for verification that your seat is safe for airplane use many airlines offer half price tickets so parents can be guaranteed that their child can travel in a crs device you should call your airline to ask for a discount and or ask what the airline's policy is for using empty seats for take offs and landings the best thing you can do to help with the ear popping is if your son is nursing nurse him if he is not nursing give your son something to drink formula milk water juice it doesn't matter or a pacifier baby formula is fine to take and you are not limited to the amount you can bring aboard as long as your child is with you do not worry http www tsa gov travelers airtravel children formula shtm new regulations allow you to take beverages including water from home as long as they are less than oz or beverages including water of any size that you have purchased from inside the security area onto planes you can also bring a limited amount of baby food onto the plane with you http www tsa gov travelers airtravel prohibited permitted prohibited items shtm save your money when it comes to buying water though because the flight attendants will provide you with hot or cold water or any other drink free at any time that you request no matter how many times you request it another trick is that if your child is not taking to the pacifier or wanting to drink gently rub his neck from the chin down to the chest several times this will cause a swallowing motion which will help with the ears popping make sure to pack plenty of things to entertain your child such as a few comfort things such as a favorite blankie or stuffed animal be sure to pack changes of clothes for your child you will need this in case he gets sick spills something on himself or in case your luggage gets lost keep your diaper bag well stocked with plenty of diapers wipes ointments and other essential things baby nail clippers and scissors are not allowed though just remember the new regulating liquids gels and such and pack accordingly you can usually find travel size baby products in stores and they are wonderful for plane use you should be respectful of other passengers and always change your child's diaper in the restroom they do have diaper bed changers in there although they can be a little small keep your doctors name and number with you also get the name and number of a doctor where you are visiting in case an emergency should come up it is a good idea to have a check up with your doctor before leaving to make sure your child is healthy enough to fly if he has even a slight cold the pressure in his ears during take off and landing even if you do the precaution methods could leave his ears aching for days after the flight most doctors recommend that if anyone is sick such as being stuffed up or already having an earache not to take the flight because of the potential damage to the ears i know my husband and other pilots do not work if they are sick because of this danger bring any medications that you might need for your child should he get sick or that he takes regularly remember that if they are not prescription medications the oz rule applies to them and they must be kept in a clear plastic bag do not give your child medicine with the hopes of it making him sleep this is not only cruel but dangerous as well last but not least if help is offered to you take it if i can be of any more help or assistance please feel free to contact me  Airbus A380 Urinary incontinence Air safety Fecal

breastfeeding question i'm weeks along and i am debating on breastfeeding i really want to because its so much healthier for the baby but my husband has his own concerns he's worried that my boobs are going to change and that they won't ever look the same again he also fears that because of that he won't be attracted to me i was just wondering if anyone has had this problem before how you handled it and do your boobs look normal after you stop breastfeeding absolutely breastfeed your baby your husband should be a little more concerned about your child's health and your health than about appearance seriously what is more important here my husband totally encouraged me and thought i was sexier because he saw me as an intelligent woman being the best mother to his child that i could be he also enjoyed my larger breasts while i was nursing i think anytime you go through pregnancy you're never going to be exactly the same as you were before you have a baby anyway ridiculous and unrealistic thinking i have nursed babies and i am only slightly half a cup size smaller than i was before i was a mom i am happy with my body i weigh lbs and i was when i was married i'm my oldest is and my youngest is i look great he tells me so all the time hot as he calls me your husband is expressing fears and they are not rational of course you're not going to look the same but the pregnancy weight will come off a whole lot faster if you nurse than if you don't i gained lbs with each of my kids and it all came right off within mos every single time breastfeeding is so good for your baby too breastfeed exclusively for no less than mos babies don't need anything else for the first mos this is recommended by the american academy of pediatrics babies get nutrients and immunity from breastmilk that cannot be duplicated in any formula their iq will be higher they are less prone to ear infections and other illnesses too what is better looking normal or attractive or do you prefer running your baby up to the er at am because he she is screaming with an ear infection every other month come on my kids were hardly ever sick when they were infants i breastfed each of them for at least mos then there is the added protection for you did you know that if a mom in her twenties breastfeeds her st baby for mos to mos her chance of ever getting breast cancer is significantly lowered maybe by as much as it's what god meant your body to do it's a no brainer plus lets not forget how much it helps with your bonding with the new baby there were times in the middle of the night that sure i didn't feel like nursing but hey it was a whole lot easier than making a bottle at am diapers won't smell as bad as a formula fed baby's either i can't think of any negatives with breast feeding just educate yourself and get help if you need it when you're starting cracked nipples are preventable it's all about how the baby latches on that was the only problem i ever had and it was with i was thinking i'm a pro at this and i wasn't paying attention well it took weeks to heal up but we got through it your breasts aren't going to look the same either way but it's not as if nursing is going to deflate you you might end up a little smaller but you're not damaged if anything you'll be healthier and isn't that what is most important here remind your husband he didn't marry a barbie doll you're a real woman and if he's a real man he will encourage you to do the best thing for both you and his child because he loves you watch and see most dads i know think breastfeeding is awesome if not sexy have your doctor tell your husband his her opinion too if that helps best wishes  Breast Infant Childbirth Milk Infant formula EastEnders Nipple piercing Humphrey Bogart Infantilism Brassiere Prostate cancer Tocopherol Urinary incontinence Cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Yoko Ono Social rule Premature birth Cytomegalovirus HIV Marilyn Monroe Shaggy dog story Medical analysis of circumcision Abortion debate Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Knots Landing Charmed Medicine Domestic rabbit Dog Futurama (TV series - season 5) Abortion Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Recurring South Park characters Kodocha Coeliac disease Simone Weil Theory of conduct Prolactinoma The Contender (television series) Baby Blues Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Stomach cancer A Course In Miracles Obesity Breast cancer AFI 100 Years series Joke Sexual attraction Stewie Griffin Anorexia nervosa Inflation Sharon Tate Negima Characters of The Sandman Reparative therapy Hillary Rodham Clinton Milton H.

why can't babies be born year olds i hate the whole infant stage anyways hi how are you i've got to say 'don't have 'em' answers are a little silly firstly it's clearly too late and secondly the asker has never said she wishes she hadn't had her baby or that it is all horrible i happen to agree with her i have a year old and a month old i love them both to bits and wouldn't change them for the world but i have realised i so don't do babies i think it was the novelty that carried me through the first but then she just got interesting and along came another baby and it's all gone backwards i love my baby to bits she is really a good baby and i love all the smiles and giggles and wriggles when she enjoys something and when she learns something new like reaching out for something etc etc but i do not like days like today when i just tried to have lunch with some friends but she wouldn't stop screaming or when i can't cook dinner without her crying and crying or when i have to plan what i'm doing around her feeds and naps and when i can't go out in the evening coz i need to be here to feed her because she won't take bottles etc etc in the grand scheme of things i know this won't last long and i was more than prepared to do it in order to have the family we wanted and i wouldn't really change a thing but i do not like the first year really or rather i struggle to find things i like and roll on walking talking eating normally etc etc my toddler has been enormous fun since she was about months and i loved every minute of it and almost feel i can't enjoy her so much becase there's a baby to look after as soon as this one is months or so i anticipate all the fun again but being born year old has its disadvantages ouch  Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jon Secada The Beach Boys About a Boy Kodocha The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe EastEnders Little Britain The Amber Spyglass Phoebe Buffay's songs Breastfeeding Friends Knots Landing Freddy Fender Mojave people Futurama (TV series - season 5) Kasparov versus The World Sharon Tate Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Father's Day (Doctor Who) The Star Wars Holiday Special Days of our Lives Oasis (band) Ron and Fez Rod Stewart Spice Girls Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an YuYu Hakusho Charmed Infant Scenes from a Memory Cliff Richard Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Salad Fingers Hall & Oates Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Piccolo Junior Saga The Rutles Happy Tree Friends Childbirth Shen Gong Wu She Loves You Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys Ayyavazhi mythology Social rule Trailer Park Boys Pitaten Kimi Finster Jennifer Lopez Time Out of Mind Tom Jones (singer) Frankie Laine IBM PC compatible Le Malade imaginaire Ron Weasley Theodicy 10 Things I Hate About You The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy FoxTrot The Smoking Room Jam (TV series) George Costanza The Contender (television series) Journey (band) Avenue Q The Beatles Neighbours Pet Sounds Pok__mon Live!

rota virus vaccine causing gas i asked this last night but didnt get many answers my son had the first dose of oral rotavirus vaccine yesterday morning yesterday evening he got horrible stinky gas i havent eaten any gassy food or anything out of the ordinary so i dont think im passing anything to him through my breast milk to make him gassy anyone else noticed this the vaccine that was causing the bowel obstructions was recalled in i did the research before he had the vaccine since mommy to david is such a narrow minded alarmist let me warn you about the site she is linking this is raw diagnosis data that doctors and parents can report possible vaccine related reactions the 'search' includes roth which is part of an overall vaccine package this is nothing more than a diagnostic tool for physicians and not a substantive source for anything more than fear mongering mommy to david is a staunch opponent of having her child vaccinated and from her posts and in my opinion a certified loon her goal here is obviously to make you think twice about doing what is best for your child which is without a doubt vaccinations call your doctor odds are it's nothing more than a little gas and it just smelled horrid but please don't listen to people who just want to scare and harm children edit actually that's the big lie you tend to share in most of your posts you post something as if you actually had knowledge but cannot identify nor do you have an understanding of what you post you post studies that are not 'causal' as fact but kelly mom and lll tend to do that on a regular basis it is sad you try to come across as someone seeking to help when in all honesty you are trying to do nothing more than scare someone into your way of thinking say what you want spin how you want people like you are the worst form of activists and do little more than hurt your own cause  Thimerosal Autism epidemic MMR vaccine Cancer Controversies in autism Smallpox Autism Rotavirus Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Vaccine Andrew Wakefield Poliomyelitis Medicine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Herpes simplex virus Hypoglycemia Medical analysis of circumcision Plame affair AIDS Rabies Mark Geier Hypnosis Colorectal cancer Allergy Marburg virus Chronic fatigue syndrome Epidemiology Obesity Causality Breastfeeding HIV Infantilism Child sexuality Abortion Cervical cancer Multiple sclerosis Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System Crohn's disease Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Vaccination Urinary incontinence Food allergy Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Transsexuality Terri Schiavo Asthma Flatulence Fecal incontinence Foot-and-mouth disease John Lott Infectious disease Measles Addiction H5N1 Psychiatry Louis Pasteur Cytomegalovirus Insomnia Adverse effect (medicine) Bipolar disorder 9/11 conspiracy theories Bioterrorism Sexual orientation Dioxin Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Pneumonia Foodborne illness Insulin Radiation therapy Chagas disease Ebola Traditional Chinese medicine Psychoanalysis Physician Expert system Timeline of the 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Tuberculosis Noam Chomsky Anorexia nervosa Raw food diet Alzheimer's disease Chiropractic Clinical depression Genetically modified food Common cold Avian influenza Mumps

what are the benefits of feeding formula instead of breast milk i wonder to myself what happened to mothers and babies before there was formula formula is primarily useful during emergencies a few rare medical conditions for mom where she is physically incapable of nursing or taking long half life radioactive medications and for infants with severe allergies that haven't yet been identified also if you cannot quit your job and you have a boss who refuses to allow you adequate time and space to pump during your shift formula can be a lifesaver but again it's still not a convenience issue really it can be more convenient to formula feed if mom is suffering recurrent bouts of mastitis and developing abscesses abscesses can be difficult to resolve while still producing milk round the clock if an infant has galactosemia special expensive formulas can be life saving if the infant is severely allergic to something in mom's diet and an elimination diet and rast testing doesn't identify it then substituting formula while mom cuts down to a minimalist diet can also be life saving in the very rare instances that a prescription medication would be dangerous to an infant and it's a tiny tiny list and a donor's breast milk was not available then formula would be an acceptable rd best option http kellymom com health index html http www amazon com medications mothers milk dp ref sr ie utf s books qid sr most medications including several for depression and bipolar disorder can be taken safely while nursing as long as the infant gets regular blood work to make sure the medication isn't building up in the blood stream if mom is out of action for unexpected surgical emergencies chemotherapy or needs long term radioactive iodine treatment for thyroid cancer then formula is an adequate substitute if previously frozen pumped milk or donor milk is unavailable while formula is the rd best option to feed children after nursing pumped milk and donor mommy's milk there are legitimate health reasons to keep it on the market and as long as employers are not legally obligated in the u s to give women the opportunity to pump at breaks and lunches then there has got to be something women can feed their infants not all of us are fortunate enough to have partners or to have partners that can support us while we stay home  Breast Childbirth Medicine Cancer Coeliac disease Infant Milk Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hypoglycemia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bipolar disorder Prostate cancer Traumatic brain injury Thyroid Clinical depression Abortion Chronic fatigue syndrome Veganism Colorectal cancer Infant formula Androgen insensitivity syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cytomegalovirus Acne Divorce Urinary incontinence Cephalic disorder Arguments for and against drug prohibition Nestl__ Allergy Infertility Medical prescription Food and Drug Administration Obstetrics Publicly funded medicine Breast cancer Medical record Transsexuality Tuberculosis Homeopathy Postpartum depression Blood transfusion Abortion debate Pneumonia Multiple sclerosis Nestl__ boycott Diarrhea Dairy Breast milk Soy milk Asthma Bone marrow transplant Terri Schiavo Premature birth Ionizing radiation Epilepsy Gastroesophageal reflux disease Medical analysis of circumcision Hay fever Mental Health Act 1983 Ulcerative colitis Fathers' rights Stomach cancer Migraine AIDS Insurance Oncology Insulin Vegetarianism Anorexia nervosa Herpes simplex virus Addiction Growth hormone treatment Hillary Rodham Clinton International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Cannabis (drug) Tocopherol Sleep apnea Emergency Medical Services American Red Cross Psychiatry Vitamin D Psoriasis Haloperidol Crohn's disease Radiation therapy Annuity Carpal tunnel syndrome Thyroid cancer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Endometriosis

baby on plane im am taking a hour flight with my month old son im taking him as a lap child does this mean hes on my lap the whole time or does he have his own seat with a carseat also any advise from anyone that has done this also im flying at night and hes sleeping thorught the night so hoopefully i will luck out faa regulations currently allow children under the age of two to fly free of charge as lap children not required to have their own seat you will need to inform the airline ahead of time that you will have a small infant traveling with you the flight attendants should place you in a front seat where you will have more room depending on the length of the flight and the airline flight attendants might give you a bassinet that attaches to the front wall to put your child in however you can not uses this during taxi take offs landings or turbulence if you are not given a bassinet you will have to hold your son in your lap the entire time this is not the safest way for a child to fly and the airlines recommend children to have their own seat with a child safety device i advise using a crs child restraint system because it is safe for the child especially during turbulence makes them feel secure is more comfortable for both parent and child and gives both of you the opportunity to relax a bit a crs is a hard backed child safety seat car seat that is approved by the government for use in both motor vehicles and aircraft in order to be certified for use on an airplane the car seat has to met the federal motor vehicle safety standards check the labels on the side of your car restraint for a sticker words will be printed in red for verification that your seat is safe for airplane use many airlines offer half price tickets so parents can be guaranteed that their child can travel in a crs device you should call your airline to ask for a discount and or ask what the airline's policy is for using empty seats i've been flying internationally and domestically with my children since they were months now here are some other tips and advice that have always worked for me and i hope will help you you will need to have all your son's documents in order it is a good idea to keep a copy of his notarized birth certificate with you if it is an international flight you will also need a passport and possibly a visa for your son depending on length of your stay verify what travel documents you will need in advance to make sure you have everything for take offs and landings the best thing you can do to help with the ear popping is if your son is still nursing nurse him if he is not nursing give him something to drink formula milk water juice it doesn't matter or a pacifier baby formula is fine to take and you are not limited to the amount you can bring aboard as long as your child is with you do not worry http www tsa gov travelers airtravel children formula shtm new regulations allow you to take beverages including water from home as long as they are less than oz or beverages including water of any size that you have purchased from inside the security area onto planes you can also bring a limited amount of baby food and non perishable items such as cheerios dried fruit goldfish just add water packets etc onto the plane with you http www tsa gov travelers airtravel prohibited permitted prohibited items shtm save your money when it comes to buying water though because the flight attendants will provide you with hot or cold water or any other drink free at any time that you request no matter how many times you request it another trick is that if your child is not taking to the pacifier or wanting to drink or nurse gently rub his neck from the chin down to the chest several times this will cause a swallowing motion which will help with the ears popping make sure to pack plenty of things to entertain your child such as a few books or toys and one or two comfort things such as a favorite blankie or stuffed animal be sure to pack changes of clothes for your child you will need this in case he gets sick spills something on himself or in case your luggage gets lost keep your diaper bag well stocked with plenty of diapers wipes ointments and other essential things baby nail clippers and scissors are not allowed though just remember the new regulating liquids gels and such and pack accordingly you can usually find travel size baby products in stores and they are wonderful for plane use you should be respectful of other passengers and always change your child's diaper in the restroom they do have diaper bed changers in there although they can be a little small keep your doctors name and number with you also get the name and number of a doctor where you are visiting in case an emergency should come up it is a good idea to have a check up with your doctor before leaving to make sure your child is healthy enough to fly if he has even a slight cold the pressure in his ears during take off and landing even if you do the precaution methods could leave his ears aching for days after the flight most doctors recommend that if anyone is sick such as being stuffed up or already having an earache not to take the flight because of the potential damage to the ears i know my husband and other pilots do not work if they are sick because of this danger bring any medications that you might need for your child should he get sick or that he takes regularly remember that if they are not prescription medications the oz rule applies to them and they must be kept in a clear plastic bag do not give your child medicine with the hopes of it making him sleep this is not only cruel but dangerous as well last but not least if help is offered to you take it if i can be of any more help or assistance please feel free to

can you use bottled water for babies formula in a pinch yes but on a regular basis no it hasn't been sterilized and that's really the point of boiling your tap water for formula plus if the bottle's been sitting around for a while harmful chemicals from the plastic can leech into the water check the expiration date on the bottle if you do plan to use it the date is for the actual bottle not the water inside  Baby bottle Bottled water Sea-Monkey Water Plastic Bong Bottle Milk Sterilization (microbiology) Coffee Wine making Autoclave Ethylene glycol Fire fighting Disinfection Breastfeeding Infant formula Ammonia Ice cream Menstrual cup Brewery Windsurfing Condom Acetic acid Nestl__ Coca-Cola Hamster The Apprentice 2 Alkane PHP MTBE Beer Water (molecule) Glossary of firefighting equipment Water purification Alcoholic proof Characters in the Smurfs Intravenous therapy Kitchen Boiling point Heavy water Dishwasher Dasani Molotov cocktail Food preservation Agar plate Ultraviolet Maple syrup Guitar Fluoride Chemical formula Creating chemical solutions Diethylene glycol Nalgene Hydroponics Soap bubble Concentration Cider Siphon Tap water Solvent Textile manufacturing Sailing Temperature Roman surface Cruising (maritime) Pet skunk Caffeine Tap (valve) Alcoholic beverage Halogen Soap Marine aquarium Water polo Material safety data sheet Dewar flask Kosher foods Sulfur Trademark Aspirin Weed control Solar power Polyethylene terephthalate Ozone Vitasoy Hydrochloric acid Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fractional distillation Cocaine Bowl Championship Series Hydrogen peroxide Hong Kong-style milk tea Single malt Scotch Formula One Metrication Flood geology Pepsi-Cola Baptism Gasoline Charmed

i'm so scared i may have to raise him by myself my fiance and i have been having problems ever since our son was born he's now months i try to make things work but he won't talk to me about our relationship he doesnt help out with the baby and is always angry at something we fight over littlest things he says i always b tch but how can i not when i'm the only one getting up at night he works hours a week and thinks he doesnt have to do anything else it's just a mess so last night i packed a few things and left took the baby to my mothers house and we're currently there i called him last night and he was out with his friend i tried talking again nothing he said he didn't feel like talking and he'd call back never did havent heard from him he left money for baby stuff as i asked i pray every night that things get better and we can be a family i'm scared that i have to raise this baby myself i will have to have jobs my son won't even know who his mommy is if i filed for child support it wouldnt even cover all of baby's daycare for a week i know everything happens for a reason but i think i made a big mistake i love my son more than anything and want him to have a good life and happy mom and i feel i will be alone for the rest of my life i cannot imagine myself with someone else and i don't want my baby to have a step farther you just hang in there and god will take care of you he gave you a wonderful blessing and he will not let you down as far as dad he is the dad so he has a right to see his child but if he's going to do his own thing anyway like hang out with his friends and not return phone calls it's probably best that you take care of your son yourself a child doesn't need to live in a house with angry unhappy parents good luck to you and god bless  EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friends Grandview, U.S.A.

where to find a complete nursery set not just bedding sets a whole set for the room thanks in advance i'm not sure if you mean the bedding set as well as the accessories to go with it or if you mean a nursery furniture collection either way take a look at www babyage com i work for them as a graphic designer and i can honestly say we constantly get in new products and have a really great selection i just had my first son one month ago and have bought quite a few things from them specifically because the shipping is cheap flat rate and because there is so much to choose from if you are looking for a furniture room collection i suggest taking a look at the simplicity sorelle and davinci sets you can buy the pieces separately or in the full room collection for cheaper we just added a lot of the simplicity and sorelle furniture so i think they are on special right now and again flat rate shipping you can't beat that if you are shipping furniture best of luck have fun shopping the nursery is the most fun part to do aside from clothes shopping haha  Animal Crossing Japanese tea ceremony Upholstery Desk Mouse (computing) Solar cell Textile manufacturing IBM PC compatible Bulk vending ELO rating system $ale of the Century Strap-on dildo RuneScape Best Buy Nintendo DS Stars!

my month old baby will only sleep hours per day but acts tired all day long what can i do all the books and experts seem to say that the average month old baby needs about hours of sleep per day my month daughter will only sleep hours per day no matter what i do she sleeps hours of naps and hours at night also she acts sleepy rubbing her eyes yawning fussing all day long even within only an hour of waking up from a nap is it normal for her to act tired all the time i try to make her nap more often but she fights it and if i try to put her to bed earlier she just wakes up earlier and won't go back to sleep right now this is her sleep schedule am wake up for day am first nap pm second nap pm bedtime i hate seeing her so tired and trying to keep her going for hours between sleeps but if i put her down after hours she will fight the nap for another hour anyway any suggestions i've putting her down after only hours and she will usually go to sleep but then it throws off the rest of her schedule for the day also i haven't started her on solids yet do you think she might sleep more after we start her on solids children tend to sleep a lot more and seem tired when they are having growth spurts and you know that they grow a lot out of the womb around the first year yes solids will help to give her the energy her body needs during this time as well as help with the sleep cycle my daughter started sleeping really well and had the perfect schedule hours at night and two hour naps of course im one of those moms that refuses to give in to the crying if i know she's tired have you started her on the semi solids yet the baby cereals i mean those are wonderful to start off and she will be getting the nutrients she requires from the formula or breast milk as well as having her body learn the process of solid food digestion she may also be over stimulated or understimulated during the day which could be tiring her out i would suggest you take her to a pediatrician to make sure it isnt something more serious however my daughter simply had to start eating food more suited to her needs she perked right up once she started learning to sling her own food around lol  Sleep Breastfeeding Narcolepsy Urinary incontinence Cat Polyphasic sleep Insomnia Daylight saving time Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Puberty Bodybuilding Characters in the Smurfs The Contender (television series) Shaggy dog story Nutrition Human height Hera Mattress Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hypoglycemia Phoebe Buffay's songs Coeliac disease Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Dream Out-of-body experience Apollo 8 Housebreaking Fancy rat Ferret Avenue Q EastEnders Gastroparesis Infant formula Folic acid Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Pet skunk Ekadasi The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Amber Spyglass Rais massacre Capercaillie Carbon dioxide Gastroesophageal reflux disease Chronic fatigue syndrome Jet lag Veganism Tocopherol Rodney McKay The Shining (film) Childbirth Sant Thakar Singh Kender Hypnosis National Football League Sewage treatment Social rule Koala Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Obesity Reflexology Sumo Sleep apnea Chocolate Futurama (TV series - season 5) Vegetarianism Dieting Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Milton H.

recommendations needed i don't have my own car but need a car seat i live in a nyc walk up and do not own a car i expect i will occasionally travel in other people's cars and taxis so i need a car seat that is easy to carry and installs quickly ideally it would be only one that goes from infant to child but recommendations would be great also thanks i recommend the graco safeseat because it is the only infant seat that goes up to lbs infant seats are way easier to install than convertible seats and infant seats either come with a stroller they snap into or you can buy small folding metal frames that turn them into strollers yes carrying a lbs baby in an infant carrier is probably ridiculous but as i said you can get wheels for them and they are way easier to install pretty much no baby is more than lbs by one year and after one year you can use the carseats built into some minivans and suvs if you are lucky enough to have those available but you should use the infant seat as long as possible as they are safer there are a few forward facing only seats that have wheels built in for travel that is your other option after your baby outgrows the infant seat i don't have any specific recommendation on those  Baby transport Station wagon Car safety Airbag Pickup truck Car body style Ford Motor Company Tire Breastfeeding Rear wheel drive Bicycle Sport utility vehicle Truck Infant Minivan Oldsmobile Silhouette Chevrolet Lumina APV Ford Falcon Taxicab Dodge Charger Passenger car Personal rapid transit Poker jargon Pontiac Trans Sport Mouse (computing) Drill bit Four wheel drive Motorcycle Honda Pilot Limousine P-61 Black Widow Mitsubishi 3000GT Ford Crown Victoria Armoured personnel carrier Lincoln LS Ethernet Hatchback Shopping cart Pontiac Aztek Autorack Pioneer Zephyr Renault Androgen insensitivity syndrome BMW Van (road vehicle) Drifting (motorsport) Toyota Prius Skateboarding trick TGV Mazda RX-7 Chevrolet Camaro Recumbent bicycle Public transport Boeing 747 Knife Manual transmission Tung Chung Dodge Aspen New York Central Railroad Crash test dummy Volkswagen Land Rover Chrysler Minivans Honda Civic Honda Prelude Buick Rendezvous The Amazing Race Locomotive Pregnancy Porsche 911 Spark plug Sex assignment Stuttering De Lorean DMC-12 Fuel efficiency Textile manufacturing Comanche Cytomegalovirus Panzer II BMW M5 Viva La Bam Social rule Toll road Crossover SUV Mercury Cougar Rapid transit Messerschmitt Bf 109 Mazda MPV Kimberly-Clark Corporation Mercedes-Benz A-Class Pennsylvania Railroad Toyota Corolla IPod Punt (boat) The Sims 2 Wind turbine

what does everyone think about cloth diapers i am in my third trimester with my rd child and we have always used pampers but we just got my youngest potty trained and i really don't want to start buyng diapers again every week is it hard to use cloth diapers is it hard to keep them clean good and bad experiences are appreciated thanks i cloth diapered my son from the time he was weeks old until he potty trained right before he turned three i loved it i can't say that there were no issues but even disposable users have issues they have blow outs and leaks and rashes yet if someone has those same issues in cloth diapers then they blame the cloth i am a cloth diaper advocate and have helped many families get their babies in cloth and they are always surprised at how easy it is the worst thing about using cloth diapers today is fighting people's stereotypes about them and the people who use them we shouldn't have to defend ourselves for making the best choice for our babies the good thing is that most people change their minds about cloth diapers once they are exposed to them and realize how much easier they are than they previously thought what a lot of people aren't aware of these days is that there is a whole world of cloth diapers available on the internet there are enough choices to make your head spin those gauzey flat diapers plastic pants and oversized safety pins that you find in the baby section of your local department store are a thing of the past and if that is someone's only experience with cloth diapers i'd be surprised if it weren't horrible diapers are meant to be changed everytime they are wet or soiled yet dispoables are made so absorbant that many consumers are spoiled and don't change the wet diaper until it is falling off the baby therefore if someone is conditioned to this mindset they will end up causing a rash on a baby by leaving a wet cloth diaper on for hours or so at a time if used and washed correctly it's not hard just use a hypoallergenic detergent such as all free and clear cloth diapers do not cause rashes however disposable diapers contain so many chemicals that they have been known to cause severe diaper rashes if you breastfeed baby's poop will just disolve in the wash once baby has solid poop you can use a flushable diaper liner to catch the solids so clean up isn't hard at all my advice to you would be to wait on the all in one or pocket diapers until your baby is eating solids regularly you will need a cover to help the diaper hold in all that liquid poo fitteds and prefolds work great as long as you buy a quality brand online and don't worry about prefolds being hard to use they're not you can just fold it into a rectangle and place it into a velcro closing cover no pins needed good luck with your choice  Infantilism Breastfeeding Kimberly-Clark Corporation Fecal incontinence Procter & Gamble Textile manufacturing Urinary incontinence Social rule Plastic Elimination communication Billiards Undergarment Fast bowling Jackass: The Movie Clothing Pitaten Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Hazing The Apprentice 2 Shit Poker jargon Menstrual cup 2000 Australian Grand Prix Jennifer Lopez Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Atkins Nutritional Approach Casting Menstrual cycle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tire Genericized trademark Strap-on dildo Characters in the Smurfs IBM PC compatible Shaggy dog story Abortion debate Dry cleaning Comanche Kimi Finster Hiking Kodocha Ron and Fez Upholstery EastEnders Zinc Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Paragliding Hard disk The Inside Knife Toilet humour Tattoo The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Bong Japanese tea ceremony Cheese Plame affair Dishwasher Extreme Programming Conker's Bad Fur Day Brian Close Washing machine Knots Landing Rose (Doctor Who) Debugging 1957 World Series Mixed martial arts Hard water Fire fighting Jon Secada Scientology beliefs and practices Toilet Gaia Online Hydrogen peroxide The Fairly OddParents Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Social aspects of clothing Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Homer Simpson Aerial (dance move) Parenting Japanese toilet Waste management Hamster Equine conformation Theodicy Escherichia coli O157:H7 Charmed Drill bit

don't you think i'm correct i know someone with a year old daughter who sadly has fallen pregnant i refuse to aknowledge this girl as the child's mother i don't believe she is a mother is a woman who raises her child correctly and capably a year old girl can do neither of those things do you think that's fair and don't you think that baby's who are born to teenage incubators should be placed officially in the care of an adult until the teenager reaches or i do agree that many notice i said many not all teenage mothers are completely incapable of handling the raising of a child but that's not because they are teenagers only in the last couple of hundred years has it been the norm for you to wait until you are no longer a teenager to have children thousands of years ago you started having children as soon as you got your period the difference is in the way our children are raised thousands of years ago children were raised with the assumption that they would soon become mature adults with responsibilities today children are raised as children a distinction that began to be made around the tudor line of england i believe instead of as tiny adults this has led to a lack of maturity in teenagers whereas a long time ago those same teenagers would have been more than capable of raising their own children  Abortion debate Infantilism Androgen insensitivity syndrome Pregnancy Alois Hitler Adolescence Puberty Divorce Gender role Child sexuality Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Polyamory Sharon Tate The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Teenage pregnancy Premature birth Kakapo EastEnders Lolita Second language acquisition Nile crocodile Statutory rape Hollyoaks Motion picture rating system Girl My Life as a Teenage Robot Breastfeeding MPAA film rating system Generation X Neighbours Full House Edward III of England Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Ranma __ characters In vitro fertilisation The Amber Spyglass Spice Girls Infant baptism Human height Pedophilia Anne Boleyn History of intersex surgery Little Britain Hall & Oates The Subtle Knife Laura Schlessinger Marriage Incarnations of Immortality Child sexual abuse Child Avatar: The Last Airbender Transsexuality The Sims 2 Arjuna One Tree Hill (TV series) Miss Saigon Head louse Knots Landing Emperor Yuan of Han Emperor of Japan Supergirl The Fairly OddParents Hikikomori Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Coming of age About a Boy Fertility awareness Julia Stiles R.

upset tummy in week old baby my son only has a bowel movement once a day and it is fairly solid he always cries before he goes poo and gets really upset when he is gassy it breaks my heart to hear him like this and i am not sure if this is a normal baby thing or if he is really struggling to go he is formula fed by the reccomendation of his pediatrition but only because he has reflux due to being a preemie and he would puke up all of the breastmilk that i would give him anyone else have any suggestions to help my son out besides mylacon drops and diluted pear juice i was hoping to get him to feel better without having to take him into the dr's office if it is possible thanks for the suggestions hi there my daughter is now months and has horrible acid reflux she sounds just like your baby back when she was still so new i did give her drops of mylicon as well as thumping her to help with the problem tummy but i will promise what will work the best our dr has my daughter on a generic form of zantac it helps her with not only the acid reflux but with the gas and pain as well but the trick is that she can only brestfeed and i am not allowed any dairy it works with my daughter i could swear by it and to see her pain reduce and her weight start to gain she was very underweight we were so relieved truly consider a second opinion on the formula deal formula is so hard for their little tummies to digest and i suggest before any more medication or juices get a second opinion my daughter was a preemie too good luck p s i wouldn't listen to any old wives tales about what to try or whatever from on here it could really hurt your newborn just call another pedicatrician  Breastfeeding Gastroesophageal reflux disease Childbirth Hypoglycemia Fecal incontinence Milk Coeliac disease Stomach cancer Days of our Lives Flatulence Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prostate cancer Crohn's disease Shit Obesity Care Bears Irritable bowel syndrome Folic acid Terri Schiavo Gout Vitamin C Jaundice Ulcerative colitis Social rule Toilet humour Babe Ruth Chlorpromazine Breast milk The Ashlee Simpson Show Clinical depression Shaggy dog story Spice Girls Kodocha Adjustable gastric band Le Malade imaginaire One Life to Live Aspartame Glycogen storage disease type I Jam (TV series) Saturday Night Live Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ashlee Simpson Jon Secada Fancy Crane Chronic fatigue syndrome Gastroparesis Water (molecule) Pregnancy Miscarriage Alcohol Infant formula Tocopherol Insulin Infantilism Sharon Tate Concentration Pitaten The Contender (television series) Reflux Piccolo Junior Saga Vomiting Liam Gallagher Autism Milton H.

baby einstein like all tv is bad for your baby did you see the study i've been surprised to read frequently on this board people recommending baby einstein for each other's babies tv is not good for kids under because of the negative impact on the developing brain here's a new study that indicates babies who watch have lower vocabs that babies who don't http www latimes com news la sci babyeinstein aug story coll la tot topstories track ntothtml what is good for babies to never endure more than hours a week separation from mommy to have human milk on demand for at least years to have mommy hold the baby as much as possible for the baby to never ever ever be left to cry baby learns you want her to feel bad alone miserable because you are the all powerful parent and if you want it it must be good for mommy to read to baby talk to baby in long complicated sentences as well as baby talk how silly of course it is a question asking people if they are aware that something they think is good is bad my kids have to live in a world with all these kids whose intellect social skills emotional capacity and physical health are harmed by the uninformed choices of their parents how funny to pity children whose parents don't mistreat them out of ignorance or malice how sad http empathicparenting org daycareinfo critical html babies lungs do not need crying that is a dangerous self serving myth check out the book addicted to unhappiness these psychologists write what all psychologists know babies left to cry grow up depressed anxious insecure and self sabatoging a province in canada decided to heavily subsidize day care the results were dramatic and bad but offer more evidence of the terrible harm day care use does to infants families and society http www canada com montrealgazette news montreal story html id d cc be b d bba a a a when babies and toddlers get adequate attention their emotional needs are met and they are more independent as they age my kids are and oh dalice how silly i hardly think someone who routinely on this board and elsewhere calls bush a lying thieving torturing mass murdering gangster could qualify as a red state conservative it just makes me qualify as someone who can handle the truth whether it interferes with my plan to stick my own children in day care which it did or my desire to just live rather than ignore how our country is fast becoming a dictatorship filled with people who run from the truth ah well i certainly can't believe what i'm reading here the research is overwhelming and consistent too that formula users are far far less healthy than babies who get human milk formula use lowers the iq by points highly significant causes diabetes increases the risk of obesity and several cancers in mother and child increases the risk of allergies vastly increases the occurence of ear infections and cavities one shouldn't just make up 'facts' while ignoring reality it makes one sound like george bush if day care helped children learn to socialize day care kids wouldn't be more aggressive and more inept socially and yet again this is what all the research shows babies don't need to socialize they only begin to realize they are separate beings at around months until all they need is reciperocal interaction with mom you can't learn social skills from other unformed beings in case you haven't noticed there is no god but thanks for the lovely wishes on my children now we have to run to homeschool park day i guess all the well loved breast fed carefully tended children there will be slobbering alone under their own trees and plugged into gameboys oh right they're not it most certainly is my right em to share my opinions knowledge and experience where do you live stalinist russia dalice first you think i'm a conservative because i know humans are primates and need their mothers then you think you know about us because we're homeschoolers what other generalities can you come up with and be wrong about i agree tv is not good for children under it's not so great for children over either the only thing i'd add is that daddy time is also very good for a little one having a loving parent hold the child as much as possible is just what babies need when my son was an itsy bitsy i would wear him in a sling and go for hour 'nap walks' he loved being curled up close to daddy bouncing around in the sling by my tummy as i walked i think it was just about as close to being back in the belly as he could get  Infantilism Childbirth Urinary incontinence Theory of conduct Traumatic brain injury Milk

is daycare beneficial for a one month old i will be having a c section in september i have noone who can come to my home and help me with my older son he will be around months when the next baby comes and i have unwillingly considered putting him in daycare for the first couple of weeks so i can heal a litle bit my husband will be working and we have no family who can come and help me any suggestions i don't want to put my son in day care but i don't think i can be pulling to him once i have a c section i've had two c sections and the recovery really isn't that bad really i think if you put your child in daycare when the baby comes home you will be creating a jealousy situation start practicing now having your son crawl up on you when you sit on the couch or the bed get him used to sitting beside you not on you also consider hiring some housecleaning help or hire a mother's helper this is someone who'll come for a few hours each day just to help you out if you can pay for daycare you can pay for this and your son will be much better off  Day care Children of a Lesser Clod Breastfeeding Knots Landing Milton H.

nursing mothers or mothers who have nursed please help my month old son has two itty bitty teeth and he seems to think he can twist my breast around any way he wants and chomp down on my nipple how can i get him to stop without upsetting him or just how can i get him to stop he's only done it twice but i would like to nip this thing in the bud no pun intended if your reaction didn't scare him then try pulling him into the breast covering his nose with your breast so he has to open his mouth to breathe when he chomps this is unpleasant enough to encourage him to stop doing it if he is playing with the nipple with his teeth and hurting you pop him off and set him on the floor by your feet he will probably get upset but you are trying to teach him that if he abuses your nipple he can't nurse anymore you can pick him back up and resume nursing after a minute or less but what you just want to get across is that biting nursing time being over hope this helps i nursed two of mine until they were so i dealt with a lot of teeth  Breastfeeding Shark Breast Cat Guinea pig Shaggy dog story Janet Jackson Tooth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Backstroke Kodocha Milton H.

week old and sleeping my week old was a good sleeper until now she seems to get overtired by not napping as much as she used to she also is starting to give me a hard time putting her down i know sleep patterns change so can anyone let me know how their babies are sleeping around this age thanks she could be going through a growth spurt and needing to eat more often or something find a good routine and stick to it there's not much you can do during the day to force naps but sticking to a nightly schedule will have huge pay offs in the long run don't only lay her down asleep at night or she'll want this forever and it will make it difficult or impossible for her to settle back to sleep during the night when she wakes everyone goes in and out of sleep during the night and normally we don't notice but babies that are only rocked to sleep have a really difficult time learning to put themselves back to sleep when they are older right now she probably still needs to eat during the night ask your pediatrician it is really tough on the parents just do the best you can what worked for me was giving a bath putting on bedtime lotion fresh pajamas then breastfeeding sometimes i played some light music in the background too jack johnson is a baby whisperer at our house good luck to you  Sleep Narcolepsy Breastfeeding Mattress Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Siesta Urinary incontinence Characters in the Smurfs Insomnia Delayed sleep phase syndrome Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fertility awareness Humphrey Bogart Social rule The Tracey Ullman Show shorts The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe EastEnders Daylight saving time Cliff Richard Childbirth Campfire Spirit rover timeline for 2004 April The Amber Spyglass The Beatles discography Jon Secada New York Giants Futurama (TV series - season 5) Sleeping Murder Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Cat Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Blitzball Hansel und Gretel The Catcher in the Rye Co-sleeping Lisa's First Word W.I.T.C.H.

bed times i was just wondering what time people usually put their baby down for the night trying to figure out a good bedtime for lilly months i'm putting her down at usually to late do you think i found out with my little one that the best time is right after his last feeding bed time is usually between and babies are much different that children of school age when she gets older and starts sleeping through the night you will want to make sure she gets at least hours of sleep but for now you just react to her times if you are getting her to sleep at you are doing great keep up the good work but if putting her to sleep at makes her wide awake at a m or something i would try making her wait for awhile if on the other hand you get up at and she's not up by then try putting her to bed a little earlier your schedule also depends a lot on it  Daylight saving time EastEnders Insomnia Sleep Sleep debt Social rule Mattress Apollo 8 Co-sleeping Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Delayed sleep phase syndrome Urinary incontinence Sudden infant death syndrome Sleeping Murder Pitaten Humphrey Bogart Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Narcolepsy Public transport Breastfeeding Bedbug Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Time Out of Mind The Reeve's Prologue and Tale Aphrodite 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Fertility awareness Brewery The Pet Sounds Sessions Circadian rhythm Industrial Revolution Childbirth Phoebe Buffay's songs Shaggy dog story One-hit wonder About a Boy The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Supply and demand Elimination communication The Big Sleep The Tracey Ullman Show shorts History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Jon Secada Knots Landing Skinny Dip Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sleep apnea Current teachings of Prem Rawat Jet lag Pope John Paul I Saint Nicholas Lucid dreaming John the Baptist Cliff Richard Bedwetting Bon Jovi Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Vermicompost Sleep deprivation Babe Carey Capercaillie Jennifer Parker Child sexuality Dorama Ted Bundy Avenue Q Cupid and Psyche Kimberly-Clark Corporation Infant The Curse of Fenric Sleeping with the Enemy (1991 film) Dairy Days of our Lives The Amber Spyglass What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

switching formula has anyone changed their babies formula i am thinking of changing mine from sma to something else to see if that makes a difference there is something wrong with her and she doesn't sleep at all and is awake for up to hours at a time the docs dont think there is anything wrong but she is visually distressed i asked a question yesterday doctors no help and baby still not sleeping this is something i thought of that could help due to there being what appears to be a bad taste in her mouth that wakes her up everytime she falls asleep she is not teething and doesn't have thrush i have checked how would you switch formula has anyone experienced any bad effects the docs frown upon this in the uk but the mad doc i saw yesterday said it was fine to change i am willing to try anything to get her to sleep my poor baby is exhausted i didn't catch how old baby is but being awake for a solid hours is too much for any infant it is alright to switch formulas look for something without dairy ingredients as this could be the cause you might also want to look into finding a dr will a little more compassion towards a child who isn't sleep and a mother i feel horirble for you both she might have acid reflux which is causing her to show a bad taste but depending on age it could also be her showing you she is still hungry when you are having a hard time remember to go back to the basics is she hungry is she wet is she too cold or too warm does she have diaper rash is she gassy i'm not sure what the recommendations on switching formula is but i think you do it all in one go please correct me if i am wrong this way it is easiest to monitor allergies again i'm not sure i know i wasn't much help but i thought i would send you encouraging words keep checking on her and offering her as much mommy time as you can afford with your sleepless mind best wishes  Breastfeeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Philosophical skepticism Urinary incontinence Sleep Diaper Singlish Insomnia Infantilism Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Gastroesophageal reflux disease The Shining (film) Dream Milton H.

cloth diapers are any of you ladies using cloth diapers i am considering it because i try my best to help the enviroment in anyway i can is it a hassle using cloth diapers and did you buy them or make them i'm considering making my own diapers because they can cost each or more will it be worth my time trying to figure out how to make them i have seen patterns to do this my baby is not due for another months so i have a little time to prepare yeah i believe you on them being gross i have seen there are disposable liner also that you can just toss into the toilet and flush so you don't have to deal with all the mess it seems ridiculous that people would use wasting water etc as an excuse to fill dumps w trash instead i didn't know this was an argument if this was the case we better not flush wash hands brush teeth wash dishes etc too often i'm a working mother also or will be currently on bedrest for remainder of pregnancy i know it is a bit more responsibility but i want to do my part to leave a planet worth living on for my daughters and their children i want to clear up some misinformation given in some of the answers cloth diapers cause less diaper rash than disposable diapers problems with diaper rash in cloth diapers are often caused by the wet diaper staying on the baby too long disposable users often take advantage of the absorbancy and the fact that the baby feels dry and will keep a diaper on the baby for hours longer than it should be in of american babies wore cotton diapers only experienced diaper rash in only of american babies wore cotton diapers but of american babies experienced diaper rash ask nearly any disposable diaper advocate the environmental question and they will most likely say that while they are loading up the landfills in our world cloth diaper users are wasting the planet s water certainly gallons of water seems like a lot to wash some diapers but let s put that into perspective if we spent gallons on our diapers per month that s units of water at gallons unit in my household of adults and children we use anywhere from units a month depending on the time of year if we averaged units of water a month our units of water would constitute about of our typical monthly water usage in the summer we use more water to keep our lawn green than we do to wash our diapers that s just the numbers i think it s interesting that disposable diaper lovers including the companies that make them can make quite a fuss about the water used to wash cloth diapers nobody seems to get up in arms about the amount of water used to wash and sanitize bottles if parents feed their babies formula or pumped breastmilk for that matter in the event that a baby s parents find the time for a minute shower each day they will each use over gallons of water to keep themselves clean for that year period of diapering their baby that s almost gallons for two adults but gallons to wash their baby s diapers is supposed to be an environmental problem if disposable diaper users really think it s a better choice to pollute landfills with long lasting bacteria laden trash rather than use water to wash and flush our children s waste then shouldn t all of us adults quit taking showers wear disposable diapers and probably disposable clothing altogether and quit flushing our waste down the toilet that hardly makes sense we have wise environmentally safe and inexpensive ways to treat our sewage water remember it only costs about for the total water of laundering one child s diapers for years further water is a naturally renewing resource remember the water cycle diagrams we all came to know and love in our th grade science courses cloth diapers gross i think what's gross is all of those chemicals in disposable diapers and what they can do to babies changing cloth diapers is almost identical to changing disposable diapers the main difference between using cloth and using disposables is that yes you have to wash cloth diapers after a day or so of diaper changes now it's not as if we have to go down to the river and slap our cloth diapers against the rocks anymore modern washing machines are designed to handle a few messy diapers if a baby is exclusively breastfed for the first months baby's poop is completely water soluble so no extra work is done at all older babies poop is solid and will generally roll right off the diaper when held over the toilet no toilet dunking is required sorry to get on my soapbox mama but people slinging myths around drive me crazy anyway yes it is so worth your time i wish i could sew i'm having to buy them even though they are spendy i hear the resale value is great so i figure i'll get a lot of money back if you get pretty good at making them maybe you can start selling them  Urinary incontinence Menstrual cycle Toilet Toilet paper Microeconomics Fecal incontinence Nuclear power Energy development Clothing Hard water CPU cache Thermal power station Japanese

baby name for girl aaliyah my first daughter's name is stefani not too girly and it fits her personality i kind of like the name aaliyah but i can't get past it sounding so girly does anyone else like this name and has it become too common i'm in my th month already and i still can't decide on a name i also liked the name leilani or even chantal so is aaliyah leilani or chantal better i live in portland or originally from colorado eve is very old and common my sis in law is eva i think one is enough i do appreciate opinions even from the other side of the world i would like to think my daughters will not be confined to staying only in this country if they decided otherwise okay i forgot to mention that aaliyah was a singer actress that died about years ago in a plane crash at the age of for those who don't know she was very talented and a sweet person it's pronounced aah lee aah i mean aah lee uh i think aaliyah is a nice name i don't think it is too girly either i can't believe some people's comments but i do understand that sometimes a name just doesn't sound right until you can put it to a face for example my friend decided to call her third baby monique and people had their doubts about it and actually said them to her face after the baby was born she went ahead and called her monique anyway because she liked the name and she was naming her after her mother monica monique is now months old and she has a lovely personality and all those people who insulted her name before she was born all think it is now a lovely name i think because they can now put the name to a face and it actually belongs to someone so i guess i'm saying you decide which name you like and don't take other people's comments too much to heart because when you have a lovely little daughter in your arms and you're calling her by whatever name you decide it will seem right i prefer aaliyah out of the three names you mentioned not too common not too girly  Aaliyah R.

i wish the breast feeding mafia would shut their organic sandal wearing mouths two breast is best mothers on the bbc news moaning about the advertising for follow on milk months becuase it prevents people breastfeeding we already have legislation that prevents the advertising of first milk no special offers like bogof on formula no 'incentives' like clubcard points or advantage points and here in scotland hv's aren't allowed to even discuss formula feeding with you as an option we all know breast is best but there is an alternative for a reason according to this birkenstock clad hippy there are less than of woman physically unable to breast feed in other words we are weak if we don't breast feed i choose sleep it was my choice to make i haven't jepordised the health of my son he has never had any infections or illnesses and is as bright as a button what will it take to stop this guilt being laden on new mums i don't feel guilty for not breastfeeding i don't make excuses for using a bottle many mothers do though it is the same gang of breast thugs that quote 'facts' that haven't being proven breastfeeding makes your child happier skinnier brainier less prone to asthma cancer diabetes acne growing a nd head maybe i didn't make it clear that i have nothing at all against mothers that choose to bf good for them what i do object to is the ones who seem to make it their life mission to tell everyone how easy it is and trying to make people feel less of a parent for choosing not to esspee you prove my point beautifully of course i know formula is a subsitute for breast milk take your smug sentiments elsewhere i'm not angry at not bf'ing i'm angry with the smug people like you refusing to see the other side hop along and enjoy your saggy boobs and eye bags charlie read my 'question' again do you want me to spell it out i am angry at the type of people who take umbrage at anyone with the audactiy to choose not to bf i did try to bf my first and didn't last very long with my next i will try again but thats my choice i have no guilt about making a decision that has worked out for the best i have not called all bf mothers sandal wearing hippies that was a specific reference to the ones on the news this morning thanks for all the well balanced answers it is really refreshing to hear people declare they bottle fed and not have to give their excuse in the next breath thank you also to the mothers who have managed to bf and not judge those that don't and thanks to the ones that have reinforced everything i have said without even realising it i totally agree i breast fed my daughter for six miserable weeks thats was in i told my heatlh visitor i hated it and she said my dear girl why didnt you say so then you should stop immediately and she even went up the shop and bought me a tin of sma her theory was doing something you hated was bad for you and the baby so i stopped i could go out without leaking all over the damn place it was great my daughter is now slim brainy and pretty when i had my son i didnt even bother the knit your own yogurt brigade were on me like a pack of dogs this was i told them to bugger off and fed my son exactly like my daughter he is now six foot two brainy and never had a days illness in his life he was the greediest baby on the planet did nothing but gulp down milk morning noon and night i dread to think how i could have kept up with him and he was on baby rice at six weeks old and still wanting a bottle at night till he was bless him dont feel guilty its your body you dont have to play the part of dairy cow if you dont want to its not like you are a complete moron and cant work out the steriliziation rules just do what you want just because you had a baby dosnt instantly turn you into an automated earth mother you are the parent he she is the child they do what you want not the other way round a little more of that attitude wouldnt go amiss in this children are the centre of the universe orientated world children today are screaming brats who could do with a clip round the ear and a reminder they are not entitled to attention a trip round any supermarket on any afternoon will prove that theory  EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Infant Little Britain Dairy Sharon Tate Infant formula Theory of conduct Marilyn Monroe The Apprentice 2 Knots Landing The Contender (television series) Friends Urinary incontinence Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Amber Spyglass Singlish Daria One Piece minor characters Futurama (TV series -

why dont i see baby walkers as much anymore are they not recommended or what i think this question is good but most of the answers are poor the ones who said dangerous seem to be speaking out on what they have heard but not had experience with the ones who said they hinder walking strong muscles early development and concept of moving through space i also find incorrect my opinion at least would be based on personal experience i used one for all six of our natural born children numerous foster children we raised and passed it on for the use of neighbors and now two grandchildren no children were left unattended so no accidents occured but then again we didn't leave them unattended in the bathroom either or a bucket of water from washing a floor out and not emptied either so we didn't need to remove these items from sale because they caused drownings lighters and matches aren't bad in themselves unless of course you want to allow children to get them or play with them unattended our six children were ahead of normal developement under age five because they had interaction and more access to their world instead of stuck on a blanket playpen or bed to develope on their own constructive play and feeding the mind is how we get intelligence but supervised with all children most were sitting standing and walking by age one or under age one because of the use of a walker one was walking by age months without the continued use of a walker all had grade scores in school at honor roll level state tests given were at the highest level schools or college shows gpa's of children need close supervision in all things what might be great for one child with supervision can cause the death of another without proper supervision i do agree with the nurse who has to see how many children are injured because of lack of parents to supervise and watch their children i also feel for the police who see dead children from car accidents because parents didn't use car seats seat belts or didn't use them correctly bottom line is they couldn't control parents who didn't want to properly watch their children so it was easier to reduce deaths by removing them from the market place  Urinary incontinence Drowning Milton H.

i cannot get my week old baby to sleep any at night she has been diagnosed with gerd and is on medicine for it but it is not helping i'm sleep deprived and it shows physically emotionally and mentally it starts anywhere from pm to am and she's up until nearly am she has periods where she's fussy or just wide awake i need to figure something out i've never had this much trouble getting my other kids to sleep i try to nap during the day but it's hard with my other two kiddos this girl just doesn't sleep but i need her to i'm breaking down i had a son who from birth never seemed to sleep at all but rather seemed to recharge his batteries instead he only took twenty minute naps but he didn't have gerd he is now almost years old a daughter of ours did have gerd however years ago this problem wasn't yet named there are different degrees of gerd meaning the amount of reflux that travels back up after feeding this is the reason your daughter isn't sleeping the best answer i can give you from personal experience is to use your approved car seat for sleeping using the car seat buckle the harness with the baby on her side sitting up roll one receiving blanket into a tight roll and place behind her back and another one in front from her chest to her crotch and make sure it is close to her body for support using a kitchen chair or any other surface that would be safe under the car seat move to the side of the bed where you sleep the baby should be level with you when you are laying down so you can see her and after falling asleep if she cries when you open your eyes she is in full view the car seat should be slightly reclined so her head stays to the side and slightly backward and not chin to chest by sleeping her in an upright position this will reduce the reflux and the pain and discomfort she feels that is causing her to want to remain awake chances are that with her refusing to sleep during the night you find yourself holding her over your shoulder and this reduces her pain and gives her some relief because she is upright baby swings for some reason never offered the same help or accomplished the same result i think because of the feet dangling during the day she is too tired to insist on staying awake so for short periods she is falling asleep but not staying asleep long enough when she is awake she can exercise her legs back and chest mucles by not being in the car seat burbing the baby more then normal inbetween also helps and allowing the use of a binky all this is causing you and her to not get enough sleep sleeping her in an approved car seat for a few months while she developes further is not dangerous nor will cause her harm my daughters reflux started at birth but wasn't known but at months was reflux at months it increased to she is now over years old married with two healthy children and does not suffer from gerd her growth wasn't stunted or legs bowed nor did she have a messed up spine from being slept in a car seat all it did was allow both of us to get the sleep we needed and restful at that gerd at birth is not abnormal and not a condition for life in all cases good luck and get some needed sleep mom you deserve it and congrats  Urinary incontinence Equine conformation Gastroesophageal reflux disease Aerial (dance move) Traumatic brain injury Narcolepsy Mattress Fast bowling Breastfeeding Professional wrestling throws Abortion debate Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Cephalic disorder Diving Strap-on dildo Asthma Chronic fatigue syndrome Childbirth Out-of-body experience Shaggy dog story 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Suplex Recumbent bicycle Chair Casualty lifting Social rule Professional wrestling attacks Clinical depression Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers The Amber Spyglass Insomnia Hypoglycemia Swingout Kodocha Weight training Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Breech birth Lucid dreaming Cat The Contender (television series) Puberty Stomach cancer Carpal tunnel syndrome Coeliac disease Pitaten Scientology beliefs and practices 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sin City Backstroke Professional wrestling aerial techniques Crash test dummy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Spanking Stroke Humphrey Bogart Characters in the Smurfs Swimming Multiple sclerosis One Tree Hill (TV series) Sailing Tai Chi Chuan Bipolar disorder Passenger car Breaststroke Jon Secada Hypnosis Transsexuality Cancer Butterfly stroke Phoebe Buffay's songs Horse Psychosis Infantilism Apollo 8 Dairy The Shining (film) Massage Polyphasic sleep Addiction Dog agility Car handling Obstetrics Garfield Anatomical terms of location Autism

can you can you premake bottles of similac formula and store them in the fridge and when you store them do you have to shake them when its time for feeding also do u just store the bottles with the nipples or do u have to put the bottle cap on it is no longer recommended that you make up bottles using infant formula milk powder in advance to store in the fridge bottles should always be made up fresh using boiled water that has been left to cool for no more than half an hour this is based on the fact that the milk powder itself is not sterile and once made up there is a small risk of harmful bacteria developing in any formula which is kept for use later in the day storing made up formula milk may increase the chance of a baby becoming ill and therefore it should be avoided any milk left over after a feed should be thrown away i hope this helps  Breastfeeding Milk Baby bottle Infant formula Dairy Infant Coffee Refrigerator Nestl__ Bong Sea-Monkey Water Soy milk Tooth Nestl__ boycott Intravenous therapy Sterilization (microbiology) Dairy product Hong Kong-style milk tea Tofu Milkshake Brewery Nipple Nutrition Ice cream Cheese Tea Chocolate Food preservation Yoghurt Internal ballistics Breast milk Dairy farming Breast Decompression sickness Soybean Soft drink Premature birth Vitasoy Pasteurization Guinea pig Body piercing Plastic Factory farming Bottle Fire fighting Cartridge (firearms) Fertility awareness Rice pudding Escherichia coli O157:H7 Agar plate Pneumonia Water purification Butter Ketchup Caffeine Protein-energy malnutrition Nuclear reactor Japanese tea ceremony Acetic acid Breast pump Disinfection Cat Energy development Thermal power station Cocaine Cannabis (drug) Vitamin C Vegetarianism Dieting Alcoholic beverage Beer Baseball Ramen Peruvian cuisine Cytomegalovirus Rickets Wine making Peter Arnett Hypoglycemia Firearm Jaundice Herpes simplex virus Omega-3 fatty acid Rum International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Soy protein Hamster Domestic goat Percussion cap Silver Bacteria Mammary gland Swimming Apple Temperature Bread Organic food Divorce

what do you think about moms who forget their babies are in the car i've read too many times that a mom forgets to drop her baby off at daycare and the baby is left in the car i'm not trying to be judgemental and i can see forgetting to drop off the baby and then getting to work but to actually go work an hour day and never give a thought to your child how do you do that i agree it seems completely absurd the only thing i think of is pure exhaustion and mental fatigue i've heard of it happening with fathers too and i think it's because it's not their usual routine to take the baby to daycare and they are just on auto pilot alot of babies fall asleep while riding as well i've seen recommendations that you put your pocket book or briefcase in the back seat with the baby when you leave for work  Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Day care Rais massacre Childbirth Friends Father's Day (Doctor Who) Jon Secada Knots Landing Daylight saving time Blankets (graphic novel) The Hand That Rocks the Cradle (film) Pulp Fiction The Amber Spyglass Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Combat stress reaction Escape from New York Humphrey Bogart Scenes from a Memory Ayyavazhi mythology Laura Schlessinger Futurama (TV series - season 5) Charmed Hypnosis Kodocha Rugrats Weight training Car safety Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

old bassinet and offended mother help my mother still has the bassinet that she used with us that her mother used with her and that her mother used with her the thing is like years old i mentioned that i might not want to use it with my child because i've heard some horror stories about old furniture and safety hazards and such and she got so offended and went off on how it was good enough for her and now i can't talk to her without her blowing up about something am i wrong about this would the bassinet be fine it's not like it's in terrific shape it's been in storage for almost years if indeed it would be dangerous how can i explain to her that the safety of my child is more important to me than appeasing the family tradition i've even offered just to have the bassinet in the room for decoration she's just so offended she acts like i think i'm better than her or something when i just want to watch out for the safety of my not yet born child help now i can't talk to her about anything i mentioned i want to cloth diaper and she got snooty and offended and disposables were good enough for you i mentioned i wanted to breastfeed and well you know it's not so easy for some people formula's just fine i mentioned i didn't like the ferber method and she got all huffy and said well we let you cry it out it was good enough for us which is maybe why i can't communicate with my mother to this day sigh tell her what she probably said to you soo many times i'm the parent it's not up for discussion on the bassinet though pick up a lead paint test kit at a hardware store and see if the paint is safe check the pad it should be firm and water proof if it rocks it needs a safety thing so it can't swing too far if it has a rail the spindles can't be more tha apart if it is up to modern safety standards go for it one less thing to buy stick to your guns it's your baby not hers  Breastfeeding Sudden infant death syndrome Theodicy Sento The Catcher in the Rye Sin City Infantilism Anchor God Emperor of Dune Married... with Children Infant G-Man (Half-Life) The Doctor Dances Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) Cathode ray tube One-time pad Good Times Gun safety Swimming pool Kender School bus Jam (TV series) Blood (computer game) Domestic violence Hard disk Thermal power station Humphrey Bogart Spanking Textile manufacturing Mountaineering Miss Saigon Theory of conduct Union Pacific Railroad Ice hockey Fancy Crane Silent Night, Deadly Night American Civil Liberties Union Motorcycle M16 (rifle) Little Britain Francis Bacon (painter) Appeasement Comanche Kodocha Road safety The Inside Sears Holdings Corporation Scale model Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Smoking Room Debugging Firefighter Childbirth Inventory Characters of Lost Extreme Programming Friends The Long Game Surveillance Material safety data sheet George Costanza Mothers Against Drunk Driving Sharon Tate Chair Rose (Doctor Who) The Star Wars Holiday Special Floppy disk Tattoo Explosive material PlayStation 3 Strap-on dildo Plame affair Wayne Corporation The Apprentice 2 Elimination communication About a Boy Wood carving Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Hydrogen peroxide Escape from New York Fertility awareness Ammonia Datatype USS Tunny (SS-282) Campfire USS Vestal (AR-4) Upholstery EastEnders Conspiracy (TNG episode) RuneScape locations IBM PC compatible Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Dorama Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Premature birth Nuclear power

my wife is breastfeeding and has cracked nipples that are healing she put neosporin on and forgot to wipe it off before she fed this last round i read that this may promote yeast in the mouth it was a small ammount does anyone have any other info of the effects watch your baby for any unusual signs that the neosporin could have made the baby sick also call your pediatrician and let them know what happened to ease your mind and they would be able to tell you what could happen and side affects as far as the cracked nipples maybe even try letting them dry out and getting some sun on them instead of putting neosporin on them it has to hurt or be uncomfortable washing off the neosporin everytime you breastfeed i had this same problem i watched dozens of videos and read tons of info on how to breastfeed but when i actually tried it for the first time with my week old daughter i thought i knew what i was doing days after she was born my nipples hurt so bad and they were cracked and bleeding i was crying everytime she ate i went and saw a lactation consultant at my daughter's pediatric office i ended up having a bad latch my nipples hurt so bad they recommended that you rub your own milk around your nipple and try to let your nipples get as much air as they can like sleeping at night without a shirt bra they also said sunlight too but i'm not sure how that works because i know you would get in trouble if you just walked around town without a shirt and bra on lol anyways i had been using samples of that purple package for cracked and dry nipples called lasinoh spelling the consultant said still air and your own milk will heal them faster i also got a nipple shield from the consultant it's so great it's like a bandaid for your nipples lol they are clear silicone i think and go right over your nipple and the baby continures to nurse as normal they carry nipple shields at babies r us for they really help tell your wife about the shields it will make nursing more bearable while her nipples heal  Nipple piercing Breast Nipple Childbirth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cat Infant Mastitis Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Prolactin Infant formula Fertility awareness Guinea pig Salad Fingers Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Janet Jackson Stomach cancer Dairy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Catcher in the Rye Body piercing Certified Nursing Assistant Baby bottle Elephant Folic acid The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Urinary incontinence Jam (TV series) Babe Ruth Medical analysis of circumcision Futurama (TV series - season 5) Rais massacre EastEnders Macbeth Michael Jackson Coeliac disease Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy Cartridge (firearms) Social rule Vampire Jon Secada Puberty The Shield Obstetrics Internal ballistics Sydney Riot of 1879 Milton H.

how old does a baby have to be to sit in a front facing carseat i know a baby that sat in a front facing carseat before she was one year a little more than a month before she turned a year and she was over pounds and no longer fit in the newborn carseat her feet would bend because they were so close to the seat she's always been very long and a bit chubby most people will say year and pounds however the doctor said it was all right for her to be in a front facing carseat mainly considering it was winter and the parents could no longer put her in a rear facing carseat with a coat because the straps wouldn't go over her i'd say wait until the baby meets the normal requirement for year and pounds or if the doctor says it's okay try to stick with the rear facing carseat as long as possible until the baby reaches the year and ibs point  M16 (rifle) Boxing Professional wrestling holds Baby transport Archery Equine conformation Comanche Humphrey Bogart Childbirth Horse Strap-on dildo Elephant Station wagon Recumbent bicycle Knife Drill bit Swingout Tire Professional wrestling throws Heinkel He 112 Breech birth Internal ballistics Mario Namsos campaign Snooker Revolver Four square Mouse (computing) Undergarment Aerial (dance move) Combine (Half-Life 2) Crash test dummy Motorcycle Ben Johnson (athlete) Bicycle frame Skateboarding trick Horse tack Heinkel He 100 Breastfeeding Windsurfing B-47 Stratojet Battle of Kursk Cat View camera Obedience training Dodge Charger Operation Market Garden Piledriver (professional wrestling) Sex assignment Milton H.

new babies sleep pattern norm or not why does my two week old sleep so peaceful in the day i mean i have to wake him to eat and hes half asleep but as soon as i want to go to bed hes wide awake and nothing will calm him diaper change holding feeding gas medicine he just screams if i try to not hold him no matter what i do i feel dead in the day bc i am not getting any sleep this last until like am every morning and seems to start as soon as i decide to lay down any advice is this normal totally normal your little guy has his days and nights mixed up what is the best way to change this well you need to try to keep him up when he wants to sleep during the day stimulate him with books and singing and even baby einsteing dvd's just try to work on this gradually and keep him awake longer and wake him you just need to weave his little sleep pattern to mesh with yours it will take a while but it will work as he gets older you will see changes it is a learning curve for both of you it is tough in the beginning but it will get better keep a diary of when he sleeps and then look for a pattern and then try to change one of those sleepy times example sleep am eat feel asleep at woke to eat what you would do is try to keep one of those longer or more active so he would extend and go to sleep at noon till or so then just keep moving them longer but love my suggestion and i know not everyone can do this is sleep when he does let the house work go put a load of laundry in when he sleeps and go lay down when he wakes the laundry is done and you can put in dryer while feeding i would definately discuss the crying in the evening with his pediatritian they are going to say a type of cholic i know it cholic happens in the evening mostly try something soothing like the vacume or the baby carrier sitting on the dryer or a hair dryer if the dr gives you a diagnosis such as gerd or reflux i would definately take him to a pediatric gastroentroligist to speak to them before doping the little man up on meds i would maybe ck with your peditrician in the morn they will be happy to see you and discuss the concern but please sleep when he does and let things go don't be a worry wort of the stuff that goes undone there is plenty of time to catch up  Urinary incontinence Insomnia Sleep Breastfeeding The Amber Spyglass Narcolepsy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Out-of-body experience Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Shaggy dog story Dream Sleep apnea Characters of The Sandman Avenue Q The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Knots Landing Comanche Futurama (TV series - season 5) Phoebe Buffay's songs Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Lucid dreaming Canonical hours Philosophical skepticism Mattress Big Brother UK series 6 Daylight saving time Diaper Sleep disorder Milton H.

my baby will be months on august he was born weeks early he is trying to crawl and pull up on things he really hasn't mastered the ability of sitting up he may sit up for like to minutes at a time i hope i'm not rushing him but i really want him to sit up on his own you know so he can play and i won't have to wrry about him hitting his head so much i know children are going to fall and get cuts and stuff my question is is there anything i can do to help him sit up what did you do when you were trying to teach your child to sit up and walk a lot of parents i know said their child don't have teeth at that age and my son has teeth one at the top and two at the bottom so i know he is making progress i agree walking does mischief and more trouble than you as a mom will need the sooner they begin they learn soon enough by pulling up on tables and things i already know you're a great mom because you're too busy worrying but that's fine boppy and large pillows in a v shape are fine to help support him to sit teeth come out whenever i've heard it's when they better develop the ability to process carbs or starches some are earlier than others i wouldn't worry also a fun game only for infants who are able to hold their neck head up mos is fine is to play up down by placing him on a soft flat surface hold hands with both of his hands and encourage him to pull himself to sit uuup then lay back down in a funny sing song repeat it slowly but only as quickly as you feel him pulling it won't take him long to learn it as a sort of a reflex this is kind of like stomach crunches or sit ups for infants but it goes along with helping strengthen their arm muscles too make up your own sing song of up down and when he laughs smiles or giggles you know your song rocks corny but really cool to him as long as you gently help him exercise it's all good happy months give him plenty of hugs'n'kisses good luck and enjoy being a mum  Social rule Breastfeeding Aerial (dance move) Milton H.

parents did any of your children's eyes color change after months any after a year my daughter has blue eyes and im wondering if they are going to stay this color or change she is months old now i heard that i could change up to a year and a half and was unsure if it really does happen by months you should be able to tell if they're starting to change my little girl has blue eyes too they turned a tiny bit more greenish around months but it wasn't very noticeable you're more than likely going to permanently have a blue eyed girl  The Shining (film) Milton H.
