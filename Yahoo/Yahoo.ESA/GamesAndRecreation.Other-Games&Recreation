does this pokemon team own other pokemon trainers please rate out of ten separately torterra example here are my pokemon torterra lvl leaf storm att earthquake att cut att rock smash att dialga lvl roar of time att thunderbolt att earth power att dragon pulse att uxie lvl hyper beam att extransenory att future sight att yawn att azelf lvl extransenory att future sight att uproar att skill swap att togekiss lvl fly att facade att ancient power att toxic att lumineon lvl rubbish surf att waterfall att water pulse att water gun att hey decent team but it could use a bit of touching up i think torterra should not know cut or rock smash you could replace the two with maybe giga drain grass knot stone edge if he can learn that i'm not sure i don't use legendaries so i'll let you leave them the way they are what is the ability on togekiss if its serene grace you need to teach it air slash as the flinch occurence is increased i'd say replace fly or ancient power with fly someone could switch in a pokemon without a flying weakness to take the hit since it takes two turns your lumineon is low level so is hard to rate depending on if it has higher special attack or physical attack should determine if you have use waterfall or surf and you only need water move so try to give him a little more variety overall your team has very high potential i like all the pokemon that you use give them better move sets and you will be sitting pretty  Pok__mon types Aggron Dragonite Tenshinhan Pok__mon Trading Card Game Flygon Wild ARMs 2 Naruto jutsu Charizard Mewtwo Missingno.

any fun games to play here i am in a very boring house with nothing here are there any fun games to play with just pen and paper you have not stated whether you have opponents to play with or not but i imagine you have squares draw a grid of dots maybe x then take it in turns to draw lines that connect two dots either horizontally or vertically not diagonally if you can join lines to make a closed square put your initial in it and you get to make another line its really exciting when you get to the point where you are desperatley looking for a place to go where you won't give away any squares to your opponent also it's great when you get big 'runs' of one square after another another cool game is trying to draw each other but not looking at the page whilst you do it another game is story telling sit in a circle and each have a pen and paper start by writing a word on your own bit of paper everyone does the same then you all pass to the right the next person should write another word etc you'll end up with depending on how long you continue for a number of usually very funny stories stop the bus is another good game you draw columns on a piece of paper and head them boy's name girl's name place or country place is easier lol food animal then you get someone to count through the alphabet in their head someone else says stop the bus and using the letter the person is at you have to come up with a thing in each column first person to get all columns filled yells stop the bus another creative game to play is golf one of you takes a piece of a or standard writing paper depending where you live and draw a small circle somewhere on it to represent the hole next draw a couple of sandtraps lakes trees etc choose a point on the page as the tee off and count how many lines it would take to get the ball in the hole by missing the traps this is your par the next person then takes the pen and holds it upright on the tee off point place your finger on the top of the pen so that it is the only thing holding it and then flick the pen across the paper to try and get it in the hole remember you can't hit over the trees and if it lands in the water you must start again from the last position if it hits a bunker you must had stroke winner is the one to get par or less guess who write a the name of someone famous and stick it on your friends forhead and they guess who they are and they do the same loads of fun and loads can play battleship is a good game check out the instructions below http en wikipedia org wiki battleship game check out the website below for more games with pen and paper http www madras fife sch uk maths games  Golf Tag Baroque chess Drawing Aerial (dance move) Snooker Table tennis Shogi Glossary of American football Tai shogi Hazeltine National Golf Club Tenjiku shogi Tic-tac-toe Hangul Dai dai shogi Sudoku Chess strategy and tactics Teen Girl Squad Four square Chess Chu shogi Chess terminology Rugby union Dominoes Poker jargon Judkins shogi Taikyoku shogi Swingout Yari shogi Xiangqi Reversi Piccolo Junior Saga Cannon shogi CPU cache Polyomino Billiards Whose Line Is It Anyway?

does anyone know if there is such thing as a red gyrados if so how do i catch in pokemon diamond yes it's a particularly rare variety of gyarados while gyarados are normally blue in color there are some rare red scaled gyarados though no more powerful than their more common blue counterparts red gyarados are valued for their rarity and individuality this is caused in gold silver and crystal and the anime by a radio frequency transmitted by team rocket to force the magikarp to evolve the red coloration comes from the magikarp evolving prematurely and not undergoing the conversion from red to blue scale pigment thus they retain the same color they had as a magikarp but unfortunately i'm not sure how to catch one hope this helps  Gyarados Team Rocket Magikarp Pok__mon (video games) Ditto (Pok__mon) Pok__mon Pok__mon Yellow Color Pok__mon Emerald Pok__mon Crystal Giovanni (Pok__mon) Celebi Pok__mon Trading Card Game Pok__mon Gold and Silver Pikachu Pok__mon Abilities Misty (Pok__mon) Diamond color Diamond Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Pok__mon Red and Blue Pok__mon evolution Missingno.

pokemon diamond legendaries i want to get uxie mespirit and azelf but someone told me that i need palkia or dialga how do i get them detailed please inside of the cave use rock climb to climb your way up to a team galactic grunt fight him and then continue along until you have to fight another one on the very east side of the cave you'll find an exit leading back outside head north and then down into the crevice there's a cave down there as well as a few grunts although you won't be able to proceed deeper into the cave until team galactic is off of the mountain so you can ignore that cave if you wish after they leave come back to this entrance and you can snag yourself tm dragon claw as well as exit to the northern part of the mountain so instead use rock climb to get yourself up onto the western cliff again if you have a pokemon that can use strength you will be able to use strength on the boulders to fight less pokemon on your way to the west regardless of if you have it or not you'll want to head to the west until you find another entrance into the mountain back inside you will find a path leading to stairs climb the stairs and then fight the two grunts on the next floor keep going and you'll find another flight of stairs upstairs you'll find another grunt fight the grunt and then keep going north until you reach an exit leading out note at this point if you don't have at least ultra balls or dark balls you should turn back now and buy some you will want to have them for one of the upcoming fights you will now be on the very top of the mt coronet amidst the ancient ruins known as the spear pillar fight the two grunts guarding the entrance in a double battle and then head north a bit to see a dangerous sight mars jupiter and cyrus after some intense dialogue cyrus will proceed to awaken dialga or if you're playing pokemon pearl palkia in the most amazing scene ever in the history of pokemon games at least that's what i think save your game and heal your pokemon because you're about to enter a pretty challenging fight when you're ready step north and mars and jupiter will challenge you to a fight just then rival will rush in to help you out eager to get his revenge on jupiter from their battle in lake acuity earlier boss battle commander mars commander jupiter ' ' v v v v v v bronzor stl psy l bronzor stl psy l moves moves gyro ball extrasensory gyro ball extrasensory light screen confuse ray rock slide reflect v v v v v v purugly nrm l f skuntank psn drk l f moves moves slash shadow claw night slash poison jab aerial ace

pokemon trainer rival munchlax nrm l m staraptor nrm fly l m ponyta fir l m buizel wtr l m heracross bug ftg l m torterra grs grd l m ' ' ' ' will be roselia ponyta and empoleon if you started with chimchar will be buizel roselia and infernape if you started with turtwig munchlax unfortunately is not that helpful it knows metal sound stockpile body slam and swallow however there is a good way to get some more use out of rival knock out his munchlax unlike previous partners whenever rival loses one of his pokemon he'll replace it with the next pokemon on his roster any of his pokemon will be more helpful than munchlax so try and knock out munchlax whenever you're able to this is one of the things that makes this fight a bit of a challenge at times it will seem like a vs battle since rival has horrible judgement when using moves mars and jupiter rely heavily on annoying you their bronzors are able to use light screen and reflect to reduce the damage you deal and they can use confuse ray to confuse your pokemon their damaging attacks will be welcomed compared to their constant annoyances so try and deal with them as quickly as possible so they have minimal impact fire type attacks are your best bet although water fighting and dark type attacks will also do well mars' purugly is still a threat particularly after gaining a few levels since the last time you fought it its slash attack will probably inflict a lot of damage so try and hit purugly with a strong fighting type attack to render it incapible of fighting as soon as you're able to just watch out because it will have the added support of the bronzors or whichever other pokemon is out jupiter's skuntank is rough as always it has flamethrower in its roster so be careful with any of your steel type pokemon just handle it the best you can although their golbats are last in line they are also very annoying able to confuse and poison you as well as use mean look to prevent you from switching your pokemon one of the golbats knows sludge bomb while the other knows poison fang fortunately they're easier to take down than the bronzors a great strategy to use on these two is to target only one of them leaving one's bronzor out while you focus your attacks on the other commander's pokemon this way you won't have to deal with two powerful pokemon at once however you'll have to put up with the annoyances of the bronzor after beating the two ladies rival will heal your pokemon and will then run off now its just you cyrus and one angry time ruler pokemon space ruler in pearl obviously cyrus will instruct dialga to begin using its power to take over destroy the world but just then your little pixie friends the legendary trio will appear and will stop dialga from unleashing its true force boss battle galactic boss cyrus ' ' v v v honchkrow drk fly l m moves drill peck dark pulse steel wing embargo v v v gyarados wtr fly l m moves giga impact aqua tail ice fang earthquake v v v weavile drk ice l m moves night slash ice punch brick break x scissor v v v crobat psn fly l m moves cross poison air slash bite confuse ray ' ' marriland's pokemon at this point empoleon lv luxray lv staraptor lv lucario lv haunter lv bibarel lv ' ' cyrus' pokemon have gotten much stronger since the last time you fought against them they've all been evolved to their final stages gained or levels and he's even added a gyarados to his line up his honchkrow has high attack special attack and even pretty nice hp so be wary of its attacks use rock electric or ice type attacks against it to do the most damage you should be familliar with fighting gyarados by now so just use the regular tactics against it electric type attacks are its bane weavile is very fast and very strong it has just a little less attack than honchkrow but a tremendous amount more speed it knows scissor cross which is a high power bug type move last up is cyrus' crobat it is the fastest of all of his pokemon and it is capable of using confuse ray air slash bite and cross poison after beating cyrus he and the other commanders will leave shortly thereafter professor rowan and dawn will arrive and tell you that you have to beat or catch dialga or palkia in pearl in order to save the world drastic you know it there's no turning back now save your game and get ready to fight against the time or space ruler pokemon legendary pokemon if you're playing diamond dialga stl drg l if you're playing pearl palkia wtr drg l ' ' ' ' ' do not use your master ball on dialga or palkia they are actually very easy to catch in comparison to other legendary pokemon save it for either mesprit or cresselia later on dialga or palkia although i'm just going to say dialga for right now will be the strongest wild pokemon you've encountered it has diverse types making few attacks effective against it it also will have over in every stat as well as over special attack making its attacks quite painful to endure its signature move roar of time is a dragon type hyper beam that will inflict massive damage on the target but will render dialga unable to attack during the next turn all of its moves are offensive moves so expect a hit every single turn except for the turn after it uses roar of time don't use your strongest attacks on dialga if you have intentions of catching it instead just whittle away at its hp using hyper potions when your hp gets low and tossing ultra balls or dusk balls whenever you get the chance if you accidentally knock it out just reset and try again opening up the fight with a quick ball or two might also prove to be effective after stopping dialga by either beating it or catching it rowan and dawn will come over and congratulate you on your victory dawn will then lead you back to where you entered the ruins as rowan says something alone before leaving return to the spot where you fought dialga except keep going north and you'll find an adamant orb which will boost the potency of dialga in pearl you will pick up the lustrous orb which pretty much does the same thing for palkia at this point you can now go to sunyshore city to the east of the valor lakefront where the man was previously blocking your way however if you want a chance to catch some powerful legendary psychic pokemon you'll need to revisit all of the lakes i don't know about you but i'm not about to turn down our little pixie friends so get going to the lakes unless of course you really aren't interested in which case go to section s lake verity items tm fire blast ' ' now that you've freed the legendary trio lake verity's water level has risen so you can now surf on the lake there's a field of tall grass with tm fire blast in it on the southwest side of the lake but you'll want to surf over to the island cave in the middle of the lake inside you'll find mesprit one of the three legendary pokemon of the game similar to the legendary birds entei raikou suicune and the regis from the previous games speak to it and instead of entering a battle you'll be shown a picture of mesprit which will be added to your pokedex and counted as seen and it will then flee from you rowan will then enter the cave tell you a bunch of stuff and then tell you that you can track mesprit's position by using the marking map application on your poketch the one with the symbols on the map you'll be able to determine mesprit's position by the blinking face on the map in order to encounter it you'll need to be at the same location its at and will need to encounter it inside of tall grass be warned though it will run immediately unless you use an attack like mean look any damage you do or status conditions you inflict will remain on it for your next encounter if it flees legendary pokemon mesprit psy l ' ' ' ' ' s lake valor pokemon encounter rate frequently tall grass frequency ' type s level s morn day night bibarel nrm wtr staravia nrm fly psyduck wtr chingling psy noctowl nrm fly items tm thunder ' ' upon returning to lake valor you'll find that all of the water has been restored yay no more flopping magikarps similar to lake verity you can surf over to an island cave or over to a field of tall grass located south of the cave in the field you can pick up tm thunder inside of the cave azelf waits however unlike mesprit azelf will actually fight you right there no running so save your game in case you accidentally knock it out or run out of ultra or dusk balls and prepare to fight it legendary pokemon azelf psy l ' ' ' ' ' azelf knows nasty plot a very potent move that sharply increases azelf's special attack making its attacks deadly be very cautious about that attack and try to put it to sleep or paralyze it so you give it as few turns to use it as possible it is also considerably harder to catch than dialga or palkia so you'll need to throw lots of ultra or dusk balls at it before you'll catch it since you're in a darkened cave dusk balls will be the most effective type of poke ball to catch it with but even they will have a low chance of actually catching it s lake acuity pokemon encounter rate frequently tall grass frequency ' type s level s morn day night bibarel nrm wtr sneasel drk ice psyduck wtr chingling psy noctowl nrm fly items tm blizzard ' ' back in the snowy lake acuity there's another field of grass in the northeast section of the lake and like the two lakes before it an island cave in the middle of the lake tm blizzard can be found in the field of grass inside you will find uxie the third of the legendary trio save your game and then start the battle against it legendary pokemon uxie psy l ' ' ' ' ' uxie focuses more on defense than offense it knows amnesia which will raise its special defense sharply making your special based attacks much weaker than they are usually it also knows yawn which will put your pokemon to sleep on the next turn unless you switch it out so if it uses that attack switch out your pokemon unless you want to be put to sleep dusk balls are your friend here as uxie is also inside of cave but they'll still have a difficult time containing the little yellow pixie

can you explain the game sudoku to me how is it played what are the rules and how do you win the strategy for solving a puzzle may be regarded as comprising a combination of three processes scanning marking up and analyzing the approach to analysis may vary according to the concepts and the representations on which it is based the top right region must contain a by hatching across and up from s elsewhere the solver can eliminate all the empty cells in the region which cannot contain a this leaves only one possibility shaded green the top right region must contain a by hatching across and up from s elsewhere the solver can eliminate all the empty cells in the region which cannot contain a this leaves only one possibility shaded green edit scanning scanning is performed at the outset and throughout the solution scans need to be performed only once in between analyses scanning consists of two techniques as follows cross hatching the scanning of rows to identify which line in a region may contain a certain numeral by a process of elimination the process is repeated with the columns for fastest results the numerals are scanned in order of their frequency in sequential order it is important to perform this process systematically checking all of the digits counting in regions rows and columns to identify missing numerals counting based upon the last numeral discovered may speed up the search it also can be the case particularly in tougher puzzles that the best way to ascertain the value of a cell is to count in reverse that is by scanning the cell's region row and column for values it cannot be in order to see what remains advanced solvers look for contingencies while scanning narrowing a numeral's location within a row column or region to two or three cells when those cells lie within the same row and region they can be used for elimination during cross hatching and counting puzzles solved by scanning alone without requiring the detection of contingencies are classified as easy more difficult puzzles cannot be solved by basic scanning alone a method for marking likely numerals in a single cell by the placing of pencil dots to reduce the number of dots used in each cell the marking would only be done after as many numbers as possible have been added to the puzzle by scanning dots are erased as their corresponding numerals are eliminated as candidates a method for marking likely numerals in a single cell by the placing of pencil dots to reduce the number of dots used in each cell the marking would only be done after as many numbers as possible have been added to the puzzle by scanning dots are erased as their corresponding numerals are eliminated as candidates the partially filled sub square determines that and must go in the top row these create a contingency for the far right hatched cell based on the complete row across it must be a the partially filled sub square determines that and must go in the top row these create a contingency for the far right hatched cell based on the complete row across it must be a edit marking up scanning stops when no further numerals can be discovered making it necessary to engage in logical analysis one method to guide the analysis is to mark candidate numerals in the blank cells edit subscript notation in subscript notation the candidate numerals are written in subscript in the cells because puzzles printed in a newspaper are too small to accommodate more than a few subscript digits of normal handwriting solvers may create a larger copy of the puzzle using two colors or mixing pencil and pen marks can be helpful edit dot notation the dot notation uses a pattern of dots in each square where the dot position indicates a number from to the dot notation can be used on the original puzzle dexterity is required in placing the dots since misplaced dots or inadvertent marks inevitably lead to confusion and may not be easily erased an alternative technique is to mark the numerals that a cell cannot be the cell starts empty and as more constraints become known it slowly fills until only one mark is missing assuming no mistakes are made and the marks can be overwritten with the value of a cell there is no longer a need for any erasures  Fischer Random Chess Eight queens puzzle Halting problem Binary numeral system Cross Sums Single Transferable Vote Magic square Traditional

pokemon gold version parasites i was playing my pokemon gold version a while ago and i took my pokemon to the pokecenter i didn't have the sound up and it seemed to be taking longer than usual to heal them then the lady gave them back and said your pokemon are fully restored but they have a parasite that i can't help you with or something like that i didn't save the game so i never found out what happened with it or how it affected my pokemon anyone else seen this what in the world was it you should have saved your game the parasite in question is called the pok rus it's an extemely rare virus that doubles your pok mon's stat growth it spreads through contact so if you battle an infected pok mon your pok mon will catch it and if you keep an infected pok mon in your party the virus will spread to the rest of your team unless it is stored in the pc the virus goes away after hours unfortunately once a pok mon catches the pok rus it gains an immunity to the virus so you can't reinfect it  Pok__mon Gold and Silver Missingno.

trainer card you must win times in a row at the battle tower unlock manaphy pokemon ranger very many pokemon fans have wanted a chance to capture one of the rarest pokemon in sinnoh manaphy but due to the fact that pokemon diamond and pearl do not have any availible manaphy in the entire game so the easiest way for you to get a manaphy is for you to get the game called pokemon ranger this game has a mission that is available for you to play after you do a few things beat the pokemon ranger game on the ranger net screen hold the buttons r x and the d pad left if you beat the game you will know what the ranger net is when the screen says enter password input p m d f h cap sense is on then at the special missions screen you will see a mission called rescue the egg tap on it then do the mission and get the egg this will not be easy and will take a lot of time and effort but it all pays off at the end borrow or buy a second nintendo ds and the copy of pokemon diamond or pearl you want the manaphy on the second ds should have pokemon ranger inserted go to the ranger net with the ranger ds and tap on check the egg and then tap send message if your diamond pearl ds is close enough to receive the message you will get the manaphy egg traded to you addendum turn on your other ds with the d p cart select the option to transfer manaphy do the wireless ok's and what not go to the nearest mart with pokemon or less to pick up your egg submitted by oitsme tfries verified by sarpedon taco human koole addition by renegade pikachu correction by britni karoga unlockable blue trainer card you must defeat the elite four unlockable lucario egg after beating the fifth gym leader you can surf to the city that is next to jubilife city x be sure to have an empty slot in your pokemon party when you arrive go across the bridge and down to the boats to sail to iron mountain there is a guy named riley at the mountain that wants to cross the mountain with you take him along and fight through the mountain until you reach galactic grunts and riley has a l lucario the grunts have a glameow and goldbat provided you win riley will give you an egg that hatches into an l roilu after you travel steps or so you can clear the step counter application for the poketech and use that to count your steps roilu is the pre evolved form of lucario and when it loves you in the day time it will evolve feed roilu its favorite flavor poffin or train it to l if you have the friend application check that to see if roilu likes you or not submitted by demij gizzymonster unlockable pokemon giratina giratina is a powerful dragon ghost type that can be found deep in turnback cave a place that is said to overlap a different darker dimension anyway giratina can only be found and fought once in the game be sure to save also giratina can only be found after obtaining the national dex and beating the elite four be sure that is done turnback cave is found in a previously secluded place called sendback springs make sure you have rock climb and preferably defog because turnback cave is very foggy bring many dusk balls ultra balls or a master ball if you were saving it to get a very strong pokemon also if you don't want to fight lvl pokemon grab some repels fly to veilstone city if you aren't already there then travel down the fence maze area until you see a long empty path stretching out to the right go and travel that path until you come to a rocky wall by two trees standing together use rock climb and after the hm is done you'll be at a large clear lake very much like uxie azelf and mesprit's lakes go to the very farthest north by the lake there will be another rocky wall at the edge of the lake use rock climb again and when the hm is done you'll be standing next to a cave entrance go inside congratulations you have now entered turnback cave now for the trickiest part there will be a rock wall ahead of you read the inscription there apparently no set ways to get to giratina but it is only accessible by passing three pillars before you pass rooms once you pass the rd pillar and room you enter from here on in will be giratina's once you save before you face him take notice of these things giratina's moveset is heal block shadow force earth power slash giratina is level so have a strong pokemon in your roster after you catch it which will most likely be a grueling experience you can leave the cave not that you couldn't before if you want you can train on some powerful pokemon wild lvl range gets boosted by ten after each pillar is passed collect a rare item an infinite amount of items will appear in giratina's place after you either have caught it or fainted it rare bones stardust or you can take time to read this slightly ominous messsage engraves on the rock behind where giratina used to stand hint gba unlockable pokemon when you have different gba cartridges in your gba slot firered leafgreen ruby sapphire or emerald you can catch wild pok mon in different locations relevant to the gba game you have inserted you can get pok mon like solrock ruby lotad sapphire weedle firered caterpie leafgreen and gligar emerald this way hint pokemon mansion in route there is a mansion where a few people live out back there is a patch of grass which is predominantly inhabited by roselia mukubird pichu pikachu and korotokku however if you talk to the owner in the room to the right you can activate something else every day if you talk to him he'll walk out go back in and he'll be there and tell you of a pok mon that is inhabiting the place today sometimes its a rare shinou dex pok mon others its a non shinou dex pok mon so be alert they are however there all day so you can go back their level averages at lv to lv so bring a pok mon of that level you have up to two of these pok mon at once they have a low encounter rate in the mansion and the two pok mon are the one allocated today and yesterday hint cresselia first go to canalave city cresselia is in both diamond and pearl versions look for the boy in sailor eldritch's house talk to the boy in bed and he will be saying something in his sleep something about darkrai talk to the mother next to the boy in bed next go outside of the house and talk to the sailor next to the ship that takes you to iron island he will say something about a crecent wing then he takes you to an island on the island there should be a clearing go into it then you should see a pink yellow pokemon talk to it and it will appear on your screen and will be added to your pokedex then it will disappear its kindda like catching mesprit if you did not get the pokemon leauge or get all the pokemon in the shinoh pokedex you cannot catch cresselia now if you did not get the pokefinder application it will be much more difficult to catch cresselia this is how you get the app you have to go to the poketech company in jublife city talk to theman next to the desk on the first floor he gives you like or apps the pokefinder app is the second or third one he gives you you can get them all in the same day now good luck catching cresselia oh and one more thing i think altering between

wat would be the best pokemon party in diamond i have a lot of pokemon but wat would the best six to choose from here are my recommendations a water pokemon for surf waterfall good choices are empoleon or gyarados after nat dex use milotic a flying type probably murkrow honchkrow or staraptor after national dex you can use better pokemon like dragonite or salamence a ground frighting type both have the coverage you need torterra infernape or lucario lucario is good because of its high stats and attacks others are good for dual types lucario sticks with you forever and is a great choice a legendary dialga but before this you can use whoever you like or just keep a permanent hm slave in your party a psychic with very high special attack alakazam has the best combo of high special attack speed that is not legendary if you cannot trade then you might even want to use kadabra or meditite you may want to teach him good attack like thunderbolt and ice beam an electric type before national dex luxray because of its high atack and dark attacks after use jolteon he has insane speed and great special attack  Pok__mon Abilities Pok__mon types Dragonite Bagon Mewtwo Rayquaza Sceptile Charizard Milotic Gyarados Deoxys Pok__mon Trading Card Game Legendary Pok__mon Pok__mon Gold and Silver Pok__mon evolution Flygon Aggron Salamence Gengar Missingno.

gears of war melee trick so i know theres such thing as host advantage but does that add an advantage to the melee it seems every time i play my friend online we hit each other at the same time the first time but he somehow hits a fraction faster sometimes he even has enough time to get a headshot with the sniper or sometimes only i hit him but he has enough time to kill me with the shotgun he doesnt have me red or anything i just dont get how he can recover so quickly anyone know why on a side note anyone know other mini games to play my friends and i play tag with the frag grenades list any others he most likely did a quick reload perfectly and got the firepower boost before he went to fight u or maybe he is jut better  Team Fortress Classic Quake III Arena GunZ The Duel SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs GunBound Half-Life Battlefield 2 Halo 2 Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Natural Selection (computer game) M16 (rifle) Day of Defeat Counter-Strike Half-Life: Opposing Force Final Fantasy XI Star Wars: Battlefront II Diablo II Guilty Gear Quake 4 Super Smash Bros.

should i get pokemon battle revolution for the wii can anyone tell what its like what good items there are and is it fun and worth it i have diamond okay first there aren't any items period you can make a pokemon hold them and use them like berries but you don't have a bag to go and select for example super potions it's fun because it offers many different styles of battling and you get to see your beloved pokemon in d the attacks are in d too what you do is earn battle points and then you can spend them on the gear that your custom character wears you can also spend those on items like tms and hold items that once bought you send to your ds also if you beat all of the colosseums you get a level pikachu that knows surf you then send that to the ds as well to fully obtain those once you recieve the via wireless wii to ds and you don't need wireless internet for this you go to marts and a man in green standing by the counter will give you the items and each item you recieve gives you a wonder card those just say what the item was you bought and when those will appear somewhere in the place where you first recieve the item you can only have of those so you'll have to select the delete part to open up room for more wonder cards which mean more items it's cool to make your character because the can be however you want them to be there are three different skin colors white tan and black and there are three different styles of boys and girls for the boys one is a kid one is a cool trainer and one's a body builder for the girls one is a kid as well one is a cool girl and the other is a little girl you can make your own catch phrases like the rival trainers in diamond and pearl have so you can begin a battle by a phrase that you choose there are about different slots for the phrases slots meaning beginning of battle end of battle win lose etc then you can pick out your own clothes special outfits for each of the styles of genders can be unlocked once battling the colosseums again under the lvl rule you'll see what i mean phew there's a lot to this game and don't forget the ds battles and wi fi battles too it's really fun and definately worth it get it  Pok__mon (video games) Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Pok__mon Gold and Silver Pok__mon Emerald Pok__mon Pok__mon Colosseum Missingno.

wasn't the legend of zelda twilight princess easy i mean some parts were hard like lakebed temple but the rest was pretty obvious i would rather play maoras mask or ocarina of time which is te best game ever if you have any questions feel free to ask me i think twilight princess is the best game ever but that's because i've never played oot or any other zelda game didn't have an n never got ww for the gamecube but now i got a wii and tp sounded fun i think twilight princess was easy enough to get all the way through but challenging enough to keep me in the game for a while it took me around hours to beat the main story plus hours to get all the golden bugs poe souls and beat the cave of ordeals still haven't got all the heart containers pieces yet the hardest part was definitely cave of ordeals because you had to do a lot on a limited supply of health one thing that would've made boss battles harder is if they didn't put a million hearts in the boss arenas it also may seem easier because of the controls it takes much less time to aim by pointing the remote than it would to line up using an analog stick i thought some of the puzzles were hard most of the enemies were easy except for the heavily armored ones and those flying things that you had to clawshot their shields  The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time The Legend of Zelda series The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess Princess Zelda The Legend of Zelda series enemies The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Legend of Zelda series songs The Legend of Zelda series characters The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time places Ganon The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Boss (video games) The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Zelda II: The Adventure of Link The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters Koji Kondo Nintendo GameCube The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening Nintendo The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask characters Zora The Legend of Zelda series races The Legend of Zelda Nintendo 64 Master Sword BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban Super Smash Bros.

better stats for pokemon i have an elekid but when its with my other pokemon its stats are way lower how do i raise its stats elekid has quite low base stats when compared to other pokemon particularly those that have already evolved the best way to do it would be to evolve it into an electrobuzz and then electovire or whatever it's called giving it vitamins drugs will only take it's stats up a little because they raise hidden stats which influence the main stats  Pok__mon Abilities Elekid Pok__mon types Pok__mon evolution Pok__mon Gold and Silver Pok__mon Trading Card Game Smoochum Raichu Missingno.

pokemon diamond please what are the codes are everyone talking about in pokemon diamond people keep saying that they have or so masterballs and are doing something with them to find the pokemon they want what is this all about also please rate my team mr mime lvl physic substitute trick recycle dialga lvl metal claw dragon claw roar of time ancientpower gastrodon lvl surf waterfall strenght body slam roselia lvl giga drain ingrain cut toxic spikes infernape lvl flame wheel rock climb rock smash dig kadabra lvl newly caught oh yeah what tms could i teach my pokemon to make them better and where do you get earthquake what are friend codes and how do you use them can wifi be activated in ireland because i cant use it and how do you get to the end of victory road i dont know anything about the codes but i can rate your team first of all if you want a good team you must delete all the hm move from your pokemon such as rock smash since they are rubbish and teach them all to bibarel infernape is speedy and boasts offensive stats but is weak against water so you could send it out with gastrodon in a double battle whose ability storm drain will absorb water and none will hit infernape i think you need to re arrange your team so that you have each pokemon protecting the other but apart from that its okay you only need one psychic type as two will make your team weaker towards speedy and powerful ghost and dark types i would replace one of the psychic types with a staravia of a normal flying type that has a strong attack as they can bring down legendary pokemon easily with hyper beam since they attack first and hyper beam's attack power is boosted since the pokemon is the normal type also in tactical battles you could send out gastrodon with a normal flying type as the flying moves will protect gastrodon from its one weakness grass and the ground type of gastrodon will defeat electric types before they are able to launch attacks unto your flying type in a single battle if you teach a speedy normal flying type the move captivate it may reduce the special attack of the foe these are some of my ideas and tactics that i learnt from ultimate battles i think its good to include the following types in any team grass fire water ground and normal flying as they just about cover most of the weaknesses of other pokemon if you want to protect a psychic type from ghosts you can teach it shadow ball or a normal type with a very high attack stat that move a good tactic for a single battle is to give a strong attacking pokemon with weak defensive stats a salac berry and teach it endure so if you know the foe can defeat you in one hit you can endure it then the salac berry will raise your speed so that you will attack first next turn if you teach infernape sunny day it will boost its fire power and resistance to water type moves and in a double battle with a grass type knowing solar beam it only takes ones turn to charage and then attack  Pok__mon Gold and Silver Pok__mon Trading Card Game Wild ARMs 2 Items in the Metroid series Cradily Mewtwo Charizard Tenshinhan Volleyball Roselia Altaria RuneScape weapons Protoss Naruto jutsu Boss (video games) Bagon Baseball Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Sacrifice (computer game) GunBound Static (superhero) Team Fortress Classic Sonic Heroes Transformers: Cybertron Missingno.

what's wrong with hacked pokemon i've seen that some people don't like hacked cheated pokemon why are they weaker please answer it depends on how you hack your pokemon hacked pokemon can be hacked beyond the normal limits nintendo put on pokemon so for instance you can put higher than maximum values on certain attributes such as attacks and defense or give pokemon abilities and moves that they cannot normally learn this is blatant cheating and if detected relatively easily by nintendo could bar you from playing online unfairly against others hacked pokemon can also be made to have the best natures modest to maximise their stats special attack for their moves as long as they are hacked to have maximum allowed values and no more it's dificult to detect that they are hacked as they occur naturally in the game and be bred and trained to these values these pokemon are a little unfair but as they fall within the limits of the game they are not abnormal and can be passed off as normal pokemon  Cheating in Counter-Strike Pok__mon Abilities Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Pok__mon Trading Card Game Pok__mon Gold and Silver Missingno.

my sewing machine is too fast i have a brother xl sewing machine that has only been used about twice i've tried sewing with it but it sews way too fast and i don't know how to slow it down it is controlled by a pedal and i looked on the pedal for any speed adjusters but there arent any and the machine doesn't have anything to adjust speed either does anyone know if there is anything i can do to adjust speed like change the tension or stitch length or something i just started sewing with a machine and i dont know everytime i press the pedal even if its as slow as it can get the sewing machine goes really fast still i dont know what to do i'm a sewing machine tech and i will tell you that this problem usually stems from inside the footpedal most likely it is making contact too soon and taking off the only way to fix this is to open it up and see whats happening possibly reshape the contact so it runs slower otherwise its a circuit board problem inside the machine some electronic machines need to have the speed recalibrated by a technician of course if your stitch length is too small it will go up and down faster so lengthen the stitch length with the knob if its new and has warranty still take it back or take it to a sewing machine dealer or repair place and have it checked out good luck  Sewing machine Carburetor Sewing CPU design Electric motor Cray-1 Equine conformation Digital circuit Drill bit Wind turbine Oscilloscope Bicycle brake systems Drag racing Bicycle Dog agility RISC Action potential Textile manufacturing terminology Violin Manual transmission Central processing unit Fast bowling Tractor Musical terminology Heinkel He 100 CDC 6600 24 Hours of Le Mans Floppy disk Disc brake Pinball Recumbent bicycle Knitting Horse gait Toyota Prius Tire Flight controls Computer bus Computer Helicopter Guitar Poker jargon Autogyro Overhead lines Bubble Bobble Internal ballistics Kilt Glossary of climbing terms Beatmatching Computer virus Piano First flying machine Arcade cabinet IBM PC compatible Swingout Snowboard Hard disk Mattress Gas metal arc welding Universal Serial Bus Heinkel He 112 USB flash drive Second Battle of the Atlantic Extreme Programming Shaggy dog story BMW M5 Pedal steel guitar Turbocharger Tempo Knife Motorcycle Floyd Rose Debugging Compiler optimization Auto racing Ethernet IBM 1620 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Handloading Printed circuit board Dodge Neon Windows XP Ben Johnson (athlete) Embedded system Anti-aircraft warfare Gliding Kayak Jet engine Climbing equipment Racing bicycle Rugby union positions Textile manufacturing The Time Machine

do you know any good drinking social games i will be having a group of people for a party who hardly now each other as a host i would like to suggest a few good games to brake the ice i know a good drinking game i dont know what its called but you can make up your own name you take it in turn to say something you have never done so for example you start by saying ' i have never kissed a girl' this is just an example then everyone else in the group the has kissed a girl then has to take a drink the next person will then go on to say ' i have never and they should reveal somthing that the have never done then every who has done that particular thing should take a drink no one is allowed to drink at any other time its a good way to get to know each other also alot of fun particularly if you are saying somthing rude or you can play tactfully by saying something that you know someone else has done just so they have to admit it in front of the group take a drink and get drunk quicker haha have fun  President (game) Alcoholics Anonymous Garfield Social rule Friends Whose Line Is It Anyway?

how to catch uxie and azelf in pokemon diamond i used alot of pokeballs great balls ultre balls and i still cant catch them as with catching any pokemon in the games unless you use a masterball each pokemon catching is based on luck the higher the catch rate the easier the pokemon to catch most of the time the more common the pokemon the more easier it is to catch it take caterpies as an example caterpies are one of the most common pokemon in the frlg games unless its a version exclusive therefore it has a catch rate of the highest catch rate ever meaning that a single ball toss is likely to catch it regardless unless it wasn't weakened but then its still very likely the lowest catch rates though are normally legendary pokemon most having a catch rate of uxie mesprit and azelf have a catch rate of dialga in comparison has a catch rate of and shaymin a catch rate of as we all know status ailments particularly sleep and freeze aid in catching the pokemon as is weakening it close to hp and using balls with different effects the formulae for calculating the catch rate is very complex so i won't explain it but the best methods of catching them are use a sneasel crawdaunt or a drapion to false swipe them use a yanma to use hynosis with compundeyes as an ability get your highest level pokemon out and continually throw dusk balls at them i don't suggest using weavile or absol because of the probability that they will have pressure as an ability absol's okay as long as it has super luck instead of pressure with pressure they might use struggle if left out too long and you do not want it to use struggle when you just successfully false swiped it i suggest dark types because of their immunity against psychic types so they stay out for longer especially against uxie yanma is the only user of hypnosis that also sports compoundeyes as an ability so an accuracy of becomes out of a possible of accuracy for hypnosis which is actually more likely to hit than dark void base accuracy if you even have darkrai you can try out dark void but be wary of yuxie mesprit azelf's health which drops every turn because of bad dreams as for the balls you are using use dusk balls they have the highest catch rate of all balls excluding masterball but only if its night time or its in a dark area like a cave they have a x catch rate in comparison pokeballs have a x greatballs x and ultraballs x toxinxii  Pok__mon Gold and Silver Pok__mon types Pok__mon Colosseum Pok__mon (video games) Pok__mon Trading Card Game Fast bowling Baseball Stars Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Pump It Up Pok__mon ELO rating system Volleyball Tag American football Mewtwo Poker jargon Pok__mon (anime) GunBound Cincinnati Bengals Snooker Final Fantasy magic Softball Scyther Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Blood (computer game) RuneScape weapons Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Pok__mon Emerald Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Canadian football Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Bayesian inference Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen English cricket team Items in the Metroid series Wild ARMs 2 Hypnosis Paintball Tennis Boss (video games) Celebi Cricket New York Giants Final Fantasy XI Shedinja Cheating in Counter-Strike Psychokinesis Groudon Ravi Shastri Ragnarok Online Team Fortress Classic Super Bowl XI Sandy Koufax Four square Diablo II Urinary incontinence Gameplay of StarCraft Baseball statistics Rugby union Missingno.

any suggestions for games our youth group can play like for example we'd see who could go without saying a word with the letter s in it every week at youth group we play a game does anyone have any suggestions of fun games we could play they can be as crazy as you can think of like one of the games we are going to play is where you have to have groups and each group gets into a car and has a list of diferent resturaunts and each group has to go to those resturaunts and get a signature by the resturaunt it will have the manager or someone who works there at the resturaunt and we'll have to get the manager to sign or it could be anyone who works there just any crazy game like that would be good please give us suggestions we're runny out of games thanks im just gonna tell u some of the games that i used to play at my youth group where everyone sits on seats in a circle except one who stands in the middle that one person says 'i have never ' for example dyed my hair and then everyone who has dyed thier hair swaps places whilst the one in the middle trys to steal their seat again everyone in a circle with one in the middle but there is an extra seat everyone keeps moving around to sit on the empty seat whilst the person in the middle runs about trying to get onto that seat again everyone in a cirle but this time there is a caller and they say things like everyone who had breakfast mover to seats to the left and if there is someone on that seat they have to sit on their knee it can get interesting when there is like or more people on one seat you would be suprised how much the youth still love games like duck duck goose or british bulldogs pm me if you dont know what these are empires everyone writes down a persona on a peice of paper for example britney spears fred flinstone the pink panther something like that and these are not shown to anyone and folded up and put in a hat one person the leader reads out all the names once at the start of the game and one person starts and guesses who a person is the person who was guessed then gets a chance to ask who someone else is if they were wrong you have to be honest or the game doesnt work if your guess is correct that person becomes part of your empire and the work as a team to guess the rest of the people the aim of the game is to get everyone in your empire wink murder is a good one if these are not enough i have a million more in my head message me if you can i think i must change that option on my profile lol but yes goodluck in ur youth group hunt the dressed up leader is always a good one no set rules like the restaurant one but more interesting as the leaders can be characters  Wheel of Fortune Tag Professional wrestling throws Whose Line Is It Anyway?

rate my pokemon team in diamond pearl i'm mainly looking for suggestions on moves to change i have golem level strength stone edge earthquake rock smash empoleon level waterfall surf ice beam aqua jet torterra level cut leech seed earthquake razor leaf luxray level crunch shock wave thunderbolt bite infernape level mach punch rock climb flamethrower close combat staraptor level aerial ace fly quick attack close combat golem replace strength for fire punch or double edge rock smash for explosion empoleon ditch waterfall for grass knot aqua jet for stealth rock torterra wood hammer over cut personally id make it a physical tank and ditch leech seed and razor leaf for stone edge and crunch but if u prefer the seeder u can stick with leech seed and just replace cut with stone edge luxray its much more suited for physical attacks id breed for ice fang and fire fang along with thunder fang and crunch makes luxray actually formidable infernape its a physical sweeper so flare blitz over flamethrower i know that u receive recoil from flare blitz but it can live up to recoils and its normally ohkos so its a good way for infernape to die after killing opponents earthquake stone edge over rock climb thunderpunch over mach punch to cover the obvious water weakness staraptor its best suited for a choice band put brave bird instead of quick attack return instead of aerial ace and u turn instead of fly its a pretty defensive oriented team with a major weakness to a water pokemon with a water and ice attack which is very common the entire team with the exception of luxray and empoleon would be wiped out by a single starmie which is ur biggest threat i suggest replacing golem with something like bronzong to wall off stamie and other waters with ease  Pok__mon Abilities Naruto jutsu Aggron Sceptile Robot Master Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Wild ARMs 2 Tenshinhan Final Fantasy magic Blood (computer game) Badminton Piccolo Junior Saga Combine (Half-Life 2) Items in the Metroid series GunBound Diablo II Table tennis Limit Break Team Fortress Classic Characters of Naruto Slayers Monster Rancher monsters Bagon Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Professional wrestling attacks Poker jargon Halo: Combat Evolved Unreal Professional wrestling throws Terran (StarCraft) Volleyball Toa Altaria RuneScape quests Tank Seismic retrofit Textile manufacturing Stunt Cosmic Era Mobile Units Mario series enemies Kyoryuu Sentai ZyuRanger M16 (rifle) Cosmic Era list of characters YuYu Hakusho Wood Vegeta Baseball Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II First World Martial Arts Championship Saga Battle of France F-104 Starfighter Technology in the Stargate universe Elemental spirits (Seiken Densetsu) Tribes 2 Turok 2: Seeds of Evil USS Wasp (CV-7) Professional wrestling match types A-10 Thunderbolt II Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Force powers Turok: Rage Wars Equine conformation Pikmin Mach kernel Resident Evil (video game) Tsunami American football strategy Worms weapons and tools Natural Selection (computer game) Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Creatures in Bionicle Knife P-47 Thunderbolt GunZ The Duel Fast bowling B-47 Stratojet Trench warfare Seedot Glossary of American football Windsurfing Transformers: Cybertron Marathon (computer game) Castle Wars AC/DC Messerschmitt Bf 109 Modern naval tactics Rock, Paper, Scissors F-16 Fighting Falcon Twelve Swords of Power Messerschmitt Me 262 RuneScape skills

in dungeons and dragons how do you prepare spells how do you player's handbook says for an example that wizards must rest for hours does that mean that you as a player actually have to sleep for eight hours i know that that's not right but it also seems pretty lame for you or the dm to just be able to say and your character goes to sleep then wakes up eight hours later fully ready to prepare spells plus if it was like that then there would be no point in mentioning the benefit that sorcerers and bards don't have to prepare spells because all you'd have to do to prepare spells would be to say that your character rested for hours and then took an hour to prepare them out in a cornfield and now you and your group are ready to to go battle it's pretty obvious that i just started playing d d but this question is really burning me please help me it's that the character not you has to rest yeah you can pretty much say that you rest for eight hours but the downside to this is that not all situations will let your wizard just take a nice nap like in the middle of combat or a dungeon crawling with dreaded kobolds  Dungeons & Dragons Differences between editions of Dungeons & Dragons Spells of Dungeons & Dragons Computer role-playing game EverQuest Wizard Yu-Gi-Oh!

pokemon diamond mean look tm where can i find it or do you have any othersuggestions to catching mesprit runs after one turn currently low health very sick of chasing it after the th battle all of these ideas had no use and has big flaws also asking for best answer means you won't get it ok here how to catch mesprit i kno it doesnt perfectly answer your question but i think it answers the question your generally getting at go to the pokemon league from there buy the balls u need dusk ball has a better chance of catch rate the ultra iv herd but only at night from the pkmn league go to the end of victory road and keep walkin up nd down from the enterance to some other bit tryin to find goldbat they are around lvl for me they know mean look i caught and tryed it and am currently hyper close to catchin mesprit then aftert u hav goldbats in your team makin sure atleast goldbat is st go to sandgem from the poke center that you land at when u fly there outside the door of the center go steps left steps up if u hav ur poketech app number marking map then u can see the little face meaning mesprit on the map after youve got the steps up u will notice the face moves this is because between the th step and the th step there is an invisible barrier and wen u cross it mesprit goes else where then keep crossing this barrier until the face is right ontop of you and go into the nearest grass in hte north walk around it and get attacked it may b a shinx or budoof but ignore them keep walkin around the grass and the mesprit will atk u then get ur goldbat and make it uv mean look to make it atk b mesprit flees u myt wana give it quick claw then jst lob balls at it however be carefull cuz if the goldbat you hav is eg lvl then mesprit might use confusion which deals just over half your goldbats hp meaning it may faint thats why i bring then just use the nd goldbat nd make sure important that you make ur nd one use meanlook aswel cause wen hte pokemon tht first uses mean look is switched out or killed meanlook effect stops then jst keep goin til u catch it enjoy note usin the balls catch mesprit can cost around so it can drain money for money use amulate coin outside the pokemon mansion where there is a gentleman and a lady gentleman wiv lvl chatot and lady wiv lvl lopunny if u hav amulate coin nd there pokemon are lvl then u will get each time keep using vs seeker its bril money fast i hope this helps everyone thankyou timbo  Pok__mon Abilities Baseball Fast bowling Volleyball Poker jargon Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban New York Giants Pok__mon types Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling holds Babe Ruth Baseball statistics Paintball Rugby union The Time Machine Glossary of American football Softball History of Test cricket (to 1883) Pok__mon Gold and Silver American football Swingout GunZ The Duel Brian Close Ravi Shastri Super Bowl XXVII Pok__mon (video games) Table tennis 2005 World Series Items in the Metroid series 2004 World Series Tennis Shaggy dog story 1957 World Series Tenshinhan Piccolo Junior Saga Contredanse Tris Speaker Pok__mon Fielding (cricket) Monty Hall problem Pok__mon Emerald Blood (computer game) GunBound Pok__mon XD: Gale of Darkness Winning Streak 2004 American League Championship Series Celebi Super Bowl XXVI The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl XXV 2005 Pacific typhoon season Norway national football team Little Britain Natural Selection (computer game) Glitch City Professional wrestling slang Laws of cricket Los Angeles Dodgers Shen Gong Wu Orre Hyperinflation The Ashes Professional wrestling aerial techniques Skateboarding trick Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 The Winged Dragon of Ra 24 Hours of Le Mans Mewtwo Malaria Baseball Stars Vegeta Glossary of partner dance terms Jon Secada Charizard Snooker RuneScape weapons Rugby union positions Grand Theft Auto (game) World Series Traffic light Four square The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Championships, Wimbledon The Amber Spyglass Super Bowl XIV San Francisco 49ers EastEnders

how do you play how do you play light as a feather stiff as a board you know that weird game that they always play at sleepovers that always looks so fun i wana float in mid air hehe found this while i was looking for something else and remembered that someone had asked hope it helps you there's other sleepover games at that site too light as a feather stiff as a board ingredients just add guests to play the basic premise of this game is to have one person lie on the floor while everyone else sits on his or her knees around her with both hands slightly under her there is one storyteller who sits by the head and tells a made up story about the person on the floor's life and her untimely demise at the end of the story everyone chants light as a feather stiff as a board repeatedly as they lift her off of the ground the idea is to have everyone believing that spirits are helping to lift her off the ground in reality she is probably being lifted because of all the people helping to lift her take turns and tell a story about everyone  Professional wrestling throws Aerial (dance move) Suplex Professional wrestling holds Volleyball Badminton Professional wrestling attacks 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Comanche Mattress Escape from New York Whose Line Is It Anyway?

what items do i need to hack my pokemon pearl game i am pretty sure i dont have any thing required for it so i need a list of the items i need please help if you want to do minor hacking making pokemon appear when they should not getting unlimited master balls getting all tm's all pokemon shiny and such you only need a cheat device like action replay or xploder if you want to do serious hacking as in changing the layout of the game making different pokemon appear wherever you want adding new or different pokemon basically rewriting the code you will need to put the game onto a pc then get a hex editor and basically go through the code changing what you want and saving a lot of times in different places so you can go back and try again if you seriously mess up something you were trying to do i seriously suggest you avoid the second option if you do not know what is required or the items you need then you are really not likely to be able to read the coding or do much else to it just buy yourself a cheat device and have fun  ROM hacking Pok__mon (video games) Missingno.

millsberry dojo task problem my classes were only at so i went to play the punching game and its like the controls are messed up or something because when i press the number it wont hit so i messed with the controls changing them or something and it didnt work so idk its weird if the num lock thing on the top right side is not flashing then find the button num lock and click it also change the controls to letters if you are still having problems with the numbers karate game white belt you need to purchase a gi at the toy store how you do it go to the toy store on page there will be a gi selling for millsbucks you need to buy it yellow belt send a thank you card to robert j williams how you do it on the address book search robertjwilliams make sure you click on the top entry then you send him a thank you card if you send any other type of greeting it will not work orange belt take a picture of sylvie how you do it go to the home entertainment superstore and buy a camera any type is okay do not put it in your house then you go to sylvane lake and if you see her click on her sylvie is out times every day she appears the first time between am and pm est and she is out for hour it's always from the top to the bottom of the hour but not like she makes her nd appearance hours after the st appearance so if she's out at am she will be out again at pm the last appearance doesn't have any time pattern but always in the evening she is out for hour each evening but you can't be positive green belt find the sensei's cousin patrick's watch in the colehurst tunnels how you do it when you enter the tunnels go straight ahead and keep going until you reach a place where you have to turn either right or left there will be a small rock on the wall that can be clicked and that will let you into a secret chamber if you don't find it try this keep on going straight ahead in the tunnels untill you see a rock on the wall click on it if you do not find it try this follow the directions to chamber and turn left when you reach the choice to go left or right go straight until you reach a point where you must turn right turn right and the wall in front of you will again have a rock than can be clicked click on that rock and it will let you into the rd chamber blue belt pass a quiz about past events in millsberry how you do it what i do is open a different browser and go to the link that shows you millsberry's past events in town hall i will give the link in the sources with the other browser you take the test brown belt you need to fish in the peabody park pond to find the wallet ring and camera that were lost by the sensei's cousin patrick how you do it go fish in peabody pond i reccomend buying the red fishing rod and buying the worm bait this task gets very time consuming but it is not hard black belt grown and prune a bonsai tree until it looks excactly like the bonsai tree in the poster that was given to you by the sensei how you do it there is a book in the bookstore titled caring for a red leaf bonsai that provides some helpful hints the tree will be shown at the bottom of the my place screen below your trophies the best advice i can give you is to wait until it grows all three branches of leaves before you prune it that way you can be positive that you have not over pruned it i would prune it once and visit the dojo to see if the sensei says the tasks is complete if not prune it again and re visit the dojo be sure to not over prune your tree or you will remove the branches of leaves altogether good luck to you in millsberry  Jumpstart 3rd Grade Aikido RuneScape quests Snooker Mouse (computing) Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shotokan Bubble Bobble Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara RuneScape locations IPod The Karate Kid, Part III Customs and etiquette of Japan Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Collision detection RuneScape skills Billiards Winning Streak Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Digital photography Drag racing Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME The Amazing Race Prank flash The Inside Password Judo Shawn Michaels Dog agility Japanese tea ceremony Danger Hiptop Missingno.
