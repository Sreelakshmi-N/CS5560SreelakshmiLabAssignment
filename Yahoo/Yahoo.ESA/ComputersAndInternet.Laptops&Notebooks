what do i need to have internet on a latop ok i just bought a laptop cuz i hate my desktop wires and the space it takes but now i dont know how to have internet on my laptop being anywhere of my house do i need to stay on my desk forever or do i need my desktop back just so i can use my laptop in the kitchen for example i have an internet connection modem router and receiver but not a desktop i just have computer at my house laptop and a seller told me i only need a router to have wireless internet but how does a router works without being conneted to any computer help please it works because its wireless just like a corldess phone if its a new laptop it most likely has built in wireless if you have a wireless router already your good to go look for the wireless icon in the system tray down by the clock click it to view available wireless connections and connect you may need a key if the access point says secured on it usually this is a default key on the bottom of the router although it may of been configured manaually in which case you need to login to the router and reset change it if its unsecured it should connect right up although i would secure it if its not unless you want to share your bandwidth with your neighbors  Wi-Fi Wireless LAN Windows XP Bluetooth Universal Serial Bus Modem Password IEEE 802.11 Cisco Systems Virtual Network Computing Denial-of-service attack Mouse (computing) Internet Desktop computer Telegraphy Federal Standard 1037C AirPort IBM PC compatible GSM services Windows Server 2003 Voice over IP Object Desktop Internet Group Management Protocol Mobile ad-hoc network General Packet Radio Service Surveillance Digital Subscriber Line Network address translation Wireless mesh network Wireless access point Wardriving USB flash drive Internet fraud Taskbar Computer bus Apple Macintosh Cable television Serial communications PowerBook Broadband Internet access Transmission Control Protocol MAC address Local area network AppleTalk Television Embedded system Differentiated services PlayStation 3 Integrated Services Digital Network MDAC Skype Nintendo DS PowerPC WiMAX Nintendo Revolution IMac Routing Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Mac OS X Novell NetWare Hewlett-Packard 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Xbox 360 PCI Express OpenBSD Musical Instrument Digital Interface Telnet Hard disk Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Data center Pretty Good Privacy History of Microsoft Windows Ethernet Control Panel (Windows) HomePNA Computer Softmodem Personal computer Microprocessor Windows 2000 Linux Telephone Windows Vista ThinkPad Wireless Application Protocol Streaming media IBook Quality of service Danger Hiptop Palm OS Web crawler ALOHAnet Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Xbox

laptop screen won't turn on any ideas i have a gateway gz notebook and it seems to like to give me a hard time lately i've been leaving it on for a few days at a time and just closing the lid at night instead of turning it off when i open it in the morning it turns on just fine from standby i did that last night at about am and when i woke up at and opened the notebook the screen wouldn't come on i've tried restarting a few thousand times pulling out the cord and starting it from battery only pulling out the battery and starting from the cord only just anything out of desperation mwahahah it just won't turn on when i turn the computer on the fan starts up and the caps lock and numlock lights light up but then they turn back off and won't come on again the lights that stay on are the power light the charging light and what i believe is the wireless internet indication light i've gone to all sorts of support sites and found nothing it's an lcd screen but it seems to be a computer problem alltogether there should also be a light for hard drive usually one with something that looks like disks stacked one on top of each other if that one does not blink at all then your hard drive might have died if that's the problem then you can take it to a repair center and they might be able to recover your data if that's not the problem well still take it to a repair center anyways if it's under warranty replace 'repair center' by 'manufacturer' in all the sentences i wrote above  Windows XP Mouse (computing) ThinkPad PowerBook Hard disk IBM PC compatible Embedded system IPod Liquid crystal display Floppy disk IMac IBook Atari ST Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis System/36 Canon T90 Sega Saturn Universal Serial Bus Windows 2000 Toyota Prius Game Boy Advance Bluetooth Thermal power station Computer PlayStation Portable USB flash drive Sharp Zaurus System/34 Pinball Desknote Personal computer Stereoscopy Desktop computer Digital photography Wi-Fi Game Boy Television 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Redundant array of independent disks Oscilloscope 24 Hours of Le Mans Handheld game console Commodore International Vacuum tube USS Yorktown (CV-5) The Time Machine De Lorean DMC-12 Steven Wright USS Aylwin (DD-355) Iditarod Wind power USS San Francisco (CA-38) Second Battle of the Atlantic Apple II family USS Ammen (DD-527) USS Hoel (DD-533) USS Uhlmann (DD-687) Computer virus Apple Macintosh USS Tunny (SS-282) USS Thresher (SS-200) Altair 8800 Xbox 360 Sega Traffic light Blue screen of death Nintendo DS Nintendo Entertainment System IBM PC Nintendo Computer forensics Master Control Program USS Pennsylvania (BB-38) Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Copy protection Incandescent light bulb Voice over IP Sinclair Research Ltd History of Microsoft Windows Hybrid vehicle Poker jargon CPU design Xbox USS Waters (DD-115) IPod nano Commodore 64 2005-06 A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Great Britain Macintosh Portable USS Wichita (CA-45) Solar power Early IBM disk storage Atari 8-bit family Apple Computer USS Washington (BB-56) USS Terry (DD-513) Amiga Diablo II: Lord of Destruction

what is the difference between sleep and hibernate on laptops what is the difference between sleep and hibernate on laptops sleep turns down hard drive cpu fans and lcd but will use some power to keep all memory in the ram hibernate turns down everything that means no power consumption at all stores memory in the hard drive that said with sleep everything is already loaded in the computer and when you 'wake it up' you just have to wait for the hard drive cpu lcd and fans to turn on usually that happens pretty fast with hibernate you will have to wait for all memory to move from hard drive back to ram and for everything else to start up so sleep is faster than hibernate but sleep uses some electricity hibernate is still way faster than shut down so what's the point of shut down well from time to time the system's memory might get corrupted and sometimes a simple restart won't clear it so you would need to shut it down vt you have the concepts mixed up  Windows XP Laptop Central processing unit CPU design RISC IBM PC compatible CPU cache Embedded system Virtual memory Personal computer Booting Computer bus Apple Macintosh PowerBook Acorn Archimedes Overclocking Memory (computers) Random access memory Hard disk IMac Liquid crystal display Computer Atari ST Flash memory Microprogram Redundant array of independent disks Cray-1 Original Amiga chipset Sega Saturn INMOS Transputer Apollo Guidance Computer MRAM ZX Spectrum RAM disk Motorola 68000 PDP-11 PlayStation 2 Dynamic random access memory Commodore International Computer hardware Apple IIGS Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Front side bus Sinclair ZX81 Page table Commodore 128 ThinkPad IBook Windows 2000 IBM PC Instruction pipeline Oscilloscope Read-only memory IA-32 TRS-80 Computer storage USB flash drive Atari 8-bit family Cache Sega Dreamcast Thread (computer science) Partition (computing) Advanced Technology Attachment Commodore 64 Acorn Electron Thermal power station Nintendo Entertainment System MIPS architecture Toyota Prius Diesel engine Vector processor Assembly language Canon T90 Static Random Access Memory Acorn Computers Computer multitasking Computer forensics Amstrad CPC PlayStation 3 PowerPC Atari 2600 Pentium 4 Sharp Zaurus Tandem Computers Data General Nova Screensaver Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Desktop computer MOS Technology 6502 Commodore PET Computer architecture TRS-80 Color Computer Hibernation

internet laptop help in order to connect to the internet from my laptop anywhere in what do i need to put on my laptop to be connected anytime anywhere there are types of ways you can access internet one is with a modem and a cat ethernet cable which is directly connected to your modem the second is wireless which works by having a connection running from the modem to a wireless router most places such as hotels have wireless and sometimes a ethernet jack but it is usually possible to stay connected anytime as long as you are able to connect to either a wireless router that doesn't have security or just be linked to a modem the best solution for you would be to go wireless because that's the most convenient but the downside is that some area's have certain coverage area's verizon offers a pcmcia card that connects to the internet almost anywhere i would advise you to take a look at this also hope this helped  Wireless LAN Wi-Fi Modem Laptop Local area network Cisco Systems IEEE 802.11 Bluetooth AirPort Telegraphy IBook Wireless access point Universal Serial Bus Router Internet service provider Verizon Wireless Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Nintendo Revolution Xbox HomePNA Password IMac Computer network Digital Subscriber Line Desktop computer 3Com Corporation GSM services WiMAX Floppy disk Internet protocol suite Cable television ALOHAnet PlayStation 2 Broadband Internet access PlayStation 3 PowerPC Power line communication Internet Personal computer X.25 MAC address Verizon Communications Wireless mesh network Dongle Federal Standard 1037C Hotspot (wifi) NSA encryption systems ThinkPad Mobile ad-hoc network Secure Digital card Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Windows XP PCI Express RJ-45 Sprint Nextel Corporation Computer hardware Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Computer surveillance General Packet Radio Service Automatic teller machine Internet security Satellite internet Internet Group Management Protocol Wireless community network Internet fraud LAN party Differentiated services Denial-of-service attack IP Multimedia Subsystem Closed-circuit television Memory card Commodore 64 Transmission Control Protocol DOCSIS Apple Computer Cable modem PC card Null modem Xbox 360 BlackBerry Quality of service TIA-568A/B USB flash drive Softmodem Musical Instrument Digital Interface 10-gigabit Ethernet Nintendo DS Personal area network Nintendo GameCube AT&T Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Open Shortest Path First StarHub Cellular network

how do i get my computer to load in 'safe mode' my laptop loads and then turns itself off before it gets to my desktop and then does exactly the same again and again it's pretty old now and i want to get a new one but i need to recover my files no they're not backed up how do i force it to let me load in safe mode and does anyone want to hazard a guess as to what's wrong with the bloody thing thanks to start your windows computer in safe mode start up or your computer and get ready to press the f key before the loading windows screen appears timing is everything so you may have to try a couple times as your computer is starting up occansionally press the f key don't hold it down or press it like crazy or the computer will assume the key is stuck down and ignore it you just need to press the f key after the bios screen which is usually a logo of the manufacturer who makes your computer and before the screen that says windows xp or windows vista with the blue or green bar filling across the bottom if you press f at the right time you will be prompted on how you would like to start your computer and two of your options will be safe mode with networking and safe mode without networking i always try with networking first since that will allow internet access if the system has problems starting reboot and try again without networking if you're having trouble getting the system to start in safe mode you can always use msconfig click start run type msconfig without the quotes and click ok then select diagnostic startup on the general tab and click ok after selecting diagnostic startup the next time you reboot the computer it will start up in the a mode very similar to safe mode with only the most basic services running once you're done fixing your computer though remember to run msconfig again and change it back to normal startup i wish you the best of luck in fixing your issue gl  Windows XP Blue screen of death IBM PC compatible Windows 2000 AmigaOS Windows Vista History of Microsoft Windows Mouse (computing) Screenshot Windows 3.x Booting Microsoft Windows Hard disk Atari 8-bit family System 7 (Macintosh) X Window System Minesweeper (computer game) Mach kernel Computer virus Floppy disk Internet Relay Chat Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Commodore 64 Control-Alt-Delete Embedded system Password USB flash drive Emacs Laptop IPod Apple Macintosh Operating system Redundant array of independent disks System/36 Object Desktop Opera (web browser) Windows 95 Apple IIGS Common Unix Printing System Toyota Prius History of the graphical user interface 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines BIOS Modem Mac OS X NX bit Hello world program RISC NeXT Macromedia Flash Sun Microsystems Knoppix Ethernet MDAC Library (computer science) Bluetooth Computer security Amiga Palm OS Pretty Good Privacy OS/2 Btrieve X86 Dance Dance Revolution Control Panel (Windows) Java programming language Sonic the Hedgehog 2 PowerPC Computer Oscilloscope Architecture of Windows 2000 PlayStation Portable Database Novell NetWare CPU design Linux Windows registry Anchor Taskbar Wintel Google GSM services ITunes Atari ST Personal computer Amstrad CPC DESQview Pixel Keyboard layout ZX Spectrum IMac

would upgrading the ram of computer make it a better gaming machine or is it better to upgrade the video card i have a pretty slow computer with mb ram intel celeron processor about ghz of speed i dont exactly know what my video card is but i dont think its one of those high end ones i only want to upgrade so when i play games like black and white the gameplay wouldn't be sooo slow would it be better to upgrade the ram video card or processor please don't say all just pick one if you have to choose with such an old laptop your only two options besides overhaul which is really adviseable are ram graphics because laptops are a very different breed than their distant cousin the tinker friendly desktop computer ram is one of the few components beside the battery that will not give you a headache attempting to upgrade try opening it up and finding the ram and try to identify where your graphics card is if it looks like you would be comfortable removing it you should be ok and please be delicate  IBM PC compatible Laptop Windows XP PowerBook IMac IBook Atari ST Pentium 4 Personal computer Apple Macintosh PowerPC Overclocking PC Engine Power Macintosh G3 Mac mini History of Microsoft Windows Pentium M Mac OS X Microprocessor PC motherboard PlayStation 3 ATI Technologies Celeron PlayStation 2 TRS-80 Color Computer Sinclair ZX81 ThinkPad IBM PC Acorn Archimedes Sega Saturn Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Windows Vista RISC Cyrix TRS-80 Athlon Apple II family Amiga Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Bluetooth Atari 8-bit family Apple IIGS Nintendo Revolution Windows 2000 Computer bus Floppy disk Amstrad CPC Northbridge (computing) Commodore 64 BBC Micro ZX Spectrum Nintendo GameCube Linux Radeon Universal Serial Bus IPAQ CPU design AMD IBM Personal System/2 Pentium Computer workstation X86 Xbox 360 Final Fantasy (video game) MSX Softmodem History of computing hardware (1960s-present) The Sims 2 Desknote PlanetSide MAME Coprocessor Color Graphics Adapter Xbox Exidy Sorcerer CPU cache Nintendo 64 Computer and video games Pinball Commodore 128 TurboGrafx 16 Sega Dreamcast Wi-Fi Game Boy Mac OS X v10.4 PlayStation Portable Knoppix Nintendo Mac OS Timeline of computing

reasons for hardware maintainence this exact same question was asked and asnwered minutes ago imagine that but im not too lazy so ill copy and past for you new drivers and driver updates must be programmed and distributed to handle new innovations in software for example when mp first came out a driver had to be made to govern how your sound card interpreted the data into a playable music file cleaning the physical inside of a computer removes dust and other particles which can cause shorts in freak circumstances and much more likely cause your computer to overheat dust is a pretty good insulator of heat new innovations in software like mp can for the most part be backwards compatible but as newer parts come out from these competing companies software developers come up with new ways to take advantage of the improvements for example being able to play full length movies on a disc required upgrading to dvd standard the number one cause for advancement though is processing search engines like google get exponentially more efficient as their hardware improves to seek and process websites maintaining your computer files is a key area of maintenance as well you will always first encounter this as a first time user when your desktop becomes cluttered with shortcuts and your start bar explodes to ridiculous sizes at some point you have to see reason and re organise your files folders and shortcuts simply for user egronomics ease of use in lamens terms an issue known as disk fragmentation causes the s and s on your hard disk to be thrown about like a teenager's used clothing when it is written every once in a while you need to run the disk defragmenter so the system can move all the seperate chunks of any one file into a single solid chunk per file and then from there keep the files of the same folders in the same physical space on your drive all of this can dramatically increase how quickly your hard drive can seek data your drive will always fragment itself to a degree each time it writes new data so defragmentation should be done frequently especially after large installations or bulk file additions replacing very old parts will eventually become necessary the reason you dont see many year old computers isnt just because of modern upgrades sometimes it can be attributed to wear and tear dust as i said and heat can over time seriously affect to well being of your computers integrated circuitry and at a point it will eventually break down if left to operate under poor conditions such as being very dusty however if treated well its possible to run a pc for many years my record is years and my replacement pc has been running for nearly now with only one performance upgrade graphics eventually certain upgrades are simply required for a machine to be of any more use to us for example you would not run a machine with windows anymore because it is simply too old to support current versions of software such as windows explorer firefox video games office etc another good reason to upgrade is newer software like windows prove to then be more secure to use less prone to viruses especially when microsoft stopped offering security updates for maintenance isnt always about corprorate conspiracy most of the time there are big advantages to upgrading in years time for example almost all computers will support hd dvd or blu ray by default much in the same way as dvd  X Window System Knoppix Mozilla Firefox Personal computer MS-DOS Windows 3.x Amiga Visual Basic Linux kernel MAME ITunes MDAC Xerox Star Internet Explorer DragonFly BSD RISC Xbox 64-bit Windows Server 2003 Btrieve History of computing hardware (1960s-present) ZX Spectrum Gramophone record Timeline of computing 1990-forward Screenshot Windows Me Laptop Library (computer science) Central processing unit Architecture of Windows 2000 PNG Amstrad CPC Macromedia Flash Opera (web browser) Gmail Musical Instrument Digital Interface ATI Technologies Novell NetWare Perl Mac OS X v10.4 Spyware Digital rights management Spring operating system Apple Computer Mac OS Radeon Modchip PlayStation 3 TiVo Universal Serial Bus Software engineering History of the graphical user interface OpenOffice.org Forth programming language Enterprise content management X86 Windows 95

laptop problems hey so ive been having problems with a dell laptop where when it is plugged in if you jiggle the cord where it touches the charger the computer can turn on but the problem is whenever the computer turns on you hear it whirring loudly for a few seconds screen still black and then it gets really quiet screen still black and then it makes a quick beep and turns off i have tried repeatedly without success to make it work again but it keeps turning off it is all charged up too is there a way i can fix and preferably without buying anything also i cant get a new laptop and dont want my parents aware of it if thats possible also should i keep trying to get it to work because one day it did work but when i was using it it glitched and then i had to turn it off wtopped working again here's what i guess happened you went for coffee at school near work downtown wherever the day after everything stops working at that shop your laptop was plugged into the wall if they had an espresso machine or a coffee grinder and it was on the same circuit you just fried your motherboard if it was not on the same circuit but the lights dimmed in the restaurant you just drained your battery i saw this happen or times at the cafe where i worked for you to determine which one it may be start simple change places where you plug it in replace the battery then the bios once you get to the motherboard it's time to buy a new computer because if you fried your motherboard there is a good chance that you fried other parts on a laptop this is not always true of a desktop in this case since you can jiggle the cord and it works it is probably like every other piece of electronic equipment a short in the wire or a loose connector since i assume you are not comfortable breaking into your computer either call on the warranty service or call a local repair person if it's a bad wire then they can sell you a new battery pack if it's a connector then that needs to be fixed before you try it again bad connectors fire hazard before you do anything though check to see if you are under warranty  IPod IBM PC compatible Universal Serial Bus Oscilloscope Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Windows XP Computer bus Embedded system Commodore 64 PowerBook Personal computer Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Battery electric vehicle Surveillance Ethernet Desktop computer Jack plug Battery (electricity) BS 1363 IBM PC Atari ST Nintendo Entertainment System USB flash drive Floppy disk Spark plug Capacitor plague Computer Microprocessor FireWire Peripheral Component Interconnect D-subminiature Hard disk Hearing aid Advanced Technology Attachment STS-61 Warranty Telephone exchange Digital circuit Television Sinclair ZX81 Debugging X10 (industry standard) Musical Instrument Digital Interface Enigma machine Liquid crystal display Switch RS-232 Circuit design Toyota Prius IBook Thermal power station Wheel of Fortune Cathode ray tube Kaypro Atari 8-bit family Mouse (computing) 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Lighting Wi-Fi Residual-current device Overclocking Nintendo DS Commodore 128 Canon T90 Hewlett-Packard ATX Windows 2000 Amiga Vacuum tube AT form factor Coffeehouse Whose Line Is It Anyway?

will a laptop battery get less powerful if you leave it plugged into an adapter for a long time keeping it plugged in at your desk for a very long time i leave my laptop plugged in except for the times when i unplug it to take it downstairs for a while this doesn't wear out the battery because lithium ion batteries used by all modern laptops don't wear just because you charge them without draining them all the way though some battery types will lose capacity if you charge them before completely draining them like nimh or nicd but li ion doesn't have that problem and your laptop will not overcharge a battery once the battery is full the laptop disconnects the battery from the charger and just uses it to run the computer it only charges the battery when the battery needs charged  Battery (electricity) Lithium ion battery Laptop Nickel metal hydride Nickel-cadmium battery Battery electric vehicle Lithium ion polymer battery IPod Game Boy Advance SP PowerBook Ford Ranger EV Jack plug Memory effect Solar car Toyota Prius IBM PC compatible Hard disk BS 1363 Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Hybrid vehicle AlphaSmart Windows XP Thermal power station Personal computer Computer forensics Lead-acid battery Protoss Atari ST Cosmic Era technology USB flash drive Action potential Desktop computer Torpedo Liquid crystal display Bicycle lighting Wind turbine Spark plug Electric boat Macintosh Portable IBM PC Reading spark plugs for racing Lithium Computer bus Bluetooth Electrolysis Radio controlled car Nuclear fusion A4000 Diode Non-volatile memory Flash memory Unterseeboot 505 Plug-and-play Floppy disk Uninterruptible power supply CompactFlash Armored Core Wi-Fi Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Pentium M Second Battle of the Atlantic Membrane potential Game Boy Apple Newton MIM-23 Hawk Watch Galileo spacecraft Hearing aid CMOS Surveillance Apollo Command/Service Module Mass spectrometry Desknote Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Plaintext Game Boy Advance Computer Computer hardware Spacecraft propulsion Crown Court Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Ion thruster Diesel cycle Jump start (vehicle) Fusor Ionic bond Mouse (computing) Telephone exchange Turbocharger STS-106 PowerBook Duo Geomagnetic storm Xbox 360 2003 North America blackout Hydride AC Propulsion tzero Jumpstart 3rd Grade Microprocessor Carburetor

i need help concerning laptop memory they say that a comp needs at least gb of memory but is it still efficent as a gb does having a gb means that'll go faster or is it unncessary until you get a program that needs at least gb for memory also if the computers memory can only hold gb does that mean that under any circumstances you cannot expand it is it better to just get a pc that will hold mb but is expandable to mb or get a mb that doesnt expand or so the website says sorry if these questions are rather juvenile but i overheard a best buy worker say getting a mb comp is good even though the minimum for vista is mb but i wasn't aware that you could expand it and all tha jazz thanks last i heard the minimum for vista basic is mb gb is what our vista comp has and it's well enough for simple stuff all my parents use on their comp is internet office and email and digital photos and printer my ubuntu linux laptop has mb ram and it's plenty good for browsing the internet email youtube iming and music and my xp desktop had mb which ran pretty good but i upgraded to gb and it didn't boost performance a whole lot just it exits from memory intensive programs a lot faster  IBM PC compatible Apple Macintosh Laptop Windows XP Computer Microprocessor Windows Vista Mac OS X Personal computer Radeon Atari ST Microsoft Windows PowerPC Thread (computer science) Linux Embedded system ZX Spectrum Bluetooth Timeline of computing 1990-forward Linux kernel Mach kernel Microsoft Atari 8-bit family Desktop computer History of Microsoft Windows TRS-80 USB flash drive Apple II family INMOS Transputer PowerBook Random access memory CPU design Hewlett-Packard PaX Mac OS Flash memory System/36 64-bit Sun Microsystems IA-32 IBM PC Emacs Java programming language Ubuntu Linux TRS-80 Color Computer Commodore 64 Google Forth programming language Computer hardware Windows 2000 AmigaOS Commodore 128 Apollo Guidance Computer ATI Technologies Opera (web browser) Data General Nova Supercomputer Acorn Electron Computer forensics Common Unix Printing System Pretty Good Privacy Macintosh Finder Pentium 4 Novell NetWare Read-only memory Digital audio player Central processing unit Microsoft Office Wi-Fi Overclocking Motorola 68000 Acorn Archimedes NeXT Modem Digital photography Windows Server 2003 Universal Serial Bus Portable Document Format WordStar OpenDocument Upper Memory Area Perl Fortran TOPS-20 Assembly language Emulator Computer science Computer bus Television X Window System Sampling (music) Web design

apple or dell i'm getting a laptop when i leave for college next year and i was wondering which brand i should go for i've used windows on dell computers all my life but those cool mac vs pc commercials caught my attention i'm sick of windows always screwing my computer up and thought macs look cooler i don't play any games besides occasionally sims but instead spend most of my time doing school papers and presentations and uploading and editing pictures and going on aim and the internet with this backround information which would you recommend for me and if you suggest apple is a macbook pro worth it for me and can someone explain how getting the internet works for laptops sorry for this very very long question i appreciate it alot though oh and i'd like to add that my very influential older brother is strongly swaying me away from macs because they suck and they're only good for art majors but are they still fun to use because that's what is most important to me entertaining yet good for school work well i would say get a macbook it's powerful sturdy has good service and repair is compatible with everything if you get windows and linux it also comes with a free nano if you by it with the student discount you can also get office for it but you should instead download neooffice for free same basic idea but at no cost if you want something that is more commercial there is also apple's iwork suite what you should do is find an apple store near you then you can test at every mac that apple sells and see if os x is right for you a mac genius can also tell you anything you need to know also if you want you can get sims for the mac at aspyr com or the apple store  Apple Computer Apple Macintosh IPod ITunes Microsoft Office IBM PC compatible Laptop Wi-Fi WordPerfect Windows XP Online music store HyperCard Commodore 64 Apple II family The Sims WebObjects QuickTime MP3 Timeline of computing 1990-forward X Window System Mozilla Firefox Microsoft Radeon IMac Amiga Computer virus PowerBook Microprocessor The Sims 2 Gmail Windows Vista ITunes Music Store OpenOffice.org Pretty Good Privacy Microsoft Windows NeXT Sun Microsystems Digital rights management Operating system Floppy disk Linux kernel MSN Messenger System 7 (Macintosh) Commodore International Windows 2000 TRS-80 Digital audio workstation AOL Instant Messenger The Sims 2: University USB flash drive IBook IPhoto Podcasting Computer MAME Emacs Unicode Mac OS X v10.4 Apple Intel transition StarOffice BitTorrent Hewlett-Packard Java programming language Computer workstation Mandriva Linux Mac OS 9 RISC Game programming History of computer and video games Session Initiation Protocol Perl File Allocation Table Personal computer Digital audio player Bluetooth History of the graphical user interface LiveCD FireWire Electronic Arts Spyware PNG Advertising Atari 8-bit family Wine (software) Blu-ray Disc AppleWorks

mac vs pc for a high school student i am looking to buy a laptop for the beginning of th grade and was wondering should i go with a mac or a pc the computer that i would be getting would be around the same price so that isnt an issue but i was wondering what laptop would be the best in terms of running office programs surfing the web multimedia stability and ease to use bic gives sound advice but i have to give thumbs up to a mac it doesn't matter what your school uses your mac can access any windows or mac files if your school is wireless you can access it if it uses etherenet cables you can get on line what you won't be doing is hopefully passing any viruses along macs do not get viruses or malware etc but they can forward a virus on to someone in an email on a macbook you'll get everything you need except maybe a better word processor just buy an educational version of word or office or get a copy of open office  Computer virus Mac OS X Apple Macintosh Windows XP Microsoft Windows IBM PC compatible Microsoft Office Malware Microsoft Mac OS X v10.4 History of Microsoft Windows Microsoft Word Kazaa Spyware Laptop IPod Anti-virus software Mouse (computing) Operating system Filename extension Gmail HyperCard Windows 3.x Personal computer Mac OS Windows Vista Apple Computer Screenshot OS/2 Opera (web browser) IMac Linux Wi-Fi System 7 (Macintosh) Computer and video games Portable Document Format Peer-to-peer E-mail spam WordPerfect AmigaOS Apple II family Universal Serial Bus Computer forensics Internet Trojan horse (computing) Macromedia Flash Password NeXT Mydoom Windows 2000 Mach kernel Bluetooth Emacs Logo programming language Hard disk OpenBSD Perl PowerBook X Window System Sun Microsystems Trusted computing Windows 95 Windows Server 2003 QuickTime Mac OS 9 Digital rights management TRS-80 Macintosh Finder PowerPC ILOVEYOU Common criticisms of Microsoft Java programming language Pretty Good Privacy WebObjects Timeline of hacker history Rootkit Mac OS history IBook Skype Microsoft Excel PDP-11 Mozilla Firefox File format Stopping e-mail abuse Comparison of web browsers E-mail Amiga AppleWorks Tungsten Handheld FullWrite Professional MIPS architecture ITunes Secure Shell World Wide Web Windows registry Outlook Express WiMAX

i have a yellow dog my old ibook is runnig yellowdog but the program is not seeing the wireless card can anyone sugest a better lenux than yellowdog hugs pennyann depending on how old your ibook is this makes no sense in getting linux for the ibook if your system is at least a ghz g w mb ram bought in the last two years apple's macos x is a posix unix operating system linux is itself another posix minix based operating system in fact if you have learned how to use the apple macos unix terminal on your ibook the commands in any linux terminal are excatly the same in several cases with only minor tweaking macos can actually run several of the freeware apps originally created on linux if you have a desktop pc ie dell ibm gateway hp that is where i would install linux if you are a first time linux user then i would look to ubuntu linux with the gnome desktop fiesty fawn ubuntu linux is not the most advanced linux out there but it is nearly as easy to use as both windowsxp and macosx and is very stable and idiot resistant even its installation from dvd is graphical and friendly as i said i would not overwrite your macos x install on your ibook this would be like replacing a mustang from one dealership with mustang from another dealership just because being from a different dealership makes the car different ubuntu linux and macos x are both unix linux distro operating systems i would look at any desktop that you have around you and run ubuntu linux on that system the official website for ubuntu linux is www ubuntu com ubuntu is distributed by canonical inc when at the ubuntu website select download and the most popular version of their linux is the one running the gnome desktop this is usually the first distro available for download and the one with the most support this is also the distro that dell is currently factory installing with their systems the os is free for download but you will need to use an iso dvd disc image expander the one i used personally was my ibook's macos x disk utilities this app comes as a part of os x on your ibook to find this app on your ibook go to spotlight in the top right corner on the os x file bar and click on the magnifying glass icon then type disk utility the top hit on the appearing list should be the app disk utility click on this launching disk utility while making sure that you have a compatible dvd r or cd r disc in your ibook's dvd drive select the saved ubuntu linux disc iso image on your systems hard drive as the image you want burned to disc this process will take several minutes after the disc is burned find an x desktop pc or x intel based imac and you can run the installation of ubuntu linux on either of those machines the powerpc g based ibook cannot run ubuntu linux right now although there are some linux's on the net designed for powerpc macs most are fairly complicated to run and install and many lack basic productivity apps the process i just explained is how to download and burn the ubuntu linux installation cd dvd using your ibook  Personal computer Timeline of computing 1990-forward PowerBook Apple II family X Window System FreeBSD Commodore 64 System 7 (Macintosh) 64-bit Bluetooth Computer virus Macintosh Finder Windows Vista Atari ST Mandriva Linux Microprocessor OpenOffice.org History of Microsoft Windows SUSE Linux Laptop Berkeley Software Distribution BASIC programming language Common Unix Printing System Embedded system DOS GNU File system Supercomputer MAME Mach kernel Unix-like OS/2 Xbox PlayStation 3 Amiga Macromedia Flash Hard disk OpenBSD Computer workstation File Allocation Table Redundant array of independent disks Sun Microsystems Java programming language Partition (computing) Plan 9 (operating system) Disk image Screenshot Apple IIGS Mac OS history Power Macintosh G3 WordPerfect Yellow Dog Linux Desktop computer Timeline of computing Emacs Windows 3.x PlayStation 2 Mac mini AIX operating system Mac OS 8 History of computing hardware (1960s-present) GIMP Mac OS X v10.4 Object Desktop ITunes Nintendo Revolution Wget Modchip

extend notebook battery life by assigning xp swap space to an sd card in virtual memory settings you can set the swap file on your hard drive to zero and tell windows to use a plugged in sd flash memory card instead i e click on the flash drive drive letter set minimum to set maximum to if you do this will you be extending laptop battery life since the hard drive doesn't spin up as often the hard drive is always spinning it may spin slower or really increase speed less often if you manage to set this up properly but it will probably only get you an other seconds not to mention that the sd card will be slower then a hard drive and it will draw some extra power too and errors will probably occur sense sd cards are not meant to function non stop all the time for example when you use lots of pc usage like a game or just opening folders with hundreds of files you will lose full connection with various devices for split seconds so during that time you will probably get errors  Mouse (computing) Universal Serial Bus Windows XP File Allocation Table Windows 2000 IPod Laptop IBM PC compatible Beatmania IIDX Digital photography Virtual memory File system Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis PowerBook Apple Macintosh Telephone exchange Atari ST Dance Dance Revolution Oscilloscope Enigma machine Computer Poker jargon Xbox 360 CompactFlash Flash memory Read-only memory FireWire Computer bus Computer forensics AmigaOS CPU cache History of Microsoft Windows Commodore 64 System/36 Digital audio player Personal computer Windows 3.x SCSI Embedded system Secure Digital card Binary prefix Wi-Fi Toyota Prius Windows Vista IBM PC Partition (computing) Battery electric vehicle Memory (computers) System 7 (Macintosh) Apple IIGS Memory Stick Page table Nintendo 64 ZX Spectrum Apple II family DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Computer storage Booting Mars Exploration Rover DOS NTFS Atari 8-bit family Digital circuit Mach kernel Dynamic random access memory MRAM Xbox Sega Dreamcast Bluetooth Modem Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster PlayStation Portable PowerPC Battery (electricity) TGV Blue screen of death PlayStation 3 Sorting algorithm Creative Zen Slot machine Radeon GunZ The Duel Apple Newton History of the graphical user interface Linux IMac Nintendo DS

is my laptop battery dead or is it the ac adapter i have had my comp for about years i had a generic type of ac adapter i bought for my computer since my cat chewed though the last one it lasted for a good amount of time but last month or so it wasn't charging very well i tried jiggling it around and it would work again or take it out and put it back in that stopped working it didnt seem to work anymore so i bought a new one this is another generic type of one i plugged it in to my computer and it showed it was charging but when i turned on the computer it turned off quickly and said there was no juice i tried taking the battery out and plugging the computer in to see if it was the battery like you would with a cell phone but it didn't turn on does anyone know if a laptop could run if no battery was in there but it was plugged into the wall how can i find out if it is the battery or the adapter yes the laptop can run with only the adapter plugged in and with no battery i've done this so many times on many different models maybe it would be helpful if you could tell the model of your laptop but since you say it is only years old i'm sure it can run with only the adapter plugged in try buying some more expensive generic ac adapter i've had many cases when people lost damaged their original ac adapters and bought a generic one of good quality and it worked fine enough as the original and yes as teef au mentioned you should check if the polarity and voltage is matched as your original adapter you must set your generic adapter exactly as it was on your original adapter or your adapter laptop could get damaged the voltage and polarity are usually printed on the original adapters  Laptop Lithium ion battery IPod Toyota Prius Liquid crystal display IBM PC compatible Battery (electricity) Universal Serial Bus Atari ST Personal computer Volt Nickel-cadmium battery Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Game Boy Advance SP Electrophysiology Spark plug Battery electric vehicle Action potential PowerBook Digital photography Thermal power station Hybrid vehicle Hearing aid Circuit design Bicycle lighting AlphaSmart Membrane potential Oscilloscope Bluetooth Jumpstart 3rd Grade Atari 8-bit family Diode Vacuum tube IBM PC Windows XP ATI Technologies Jack plug Computer forensics Wind turbine Reading spark plugs for racing Read-only memory Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Nickel metal hydride Solar cell Strap-on dildo Operational amplifier Wi-Fi Lithium ion polymer battery CompactFlash Poker jargon Model aircraft Transistor Electricity meter Cruising (maritime) Light-emitting diode Oplan Bojinka Hybrid Synergy Drive Surveillance Sega Mac OS X Musical Instrument Digital Interface Radio controlled car Macintosh Portable GSM services Electroshock gun Ford Ranger EV Computer hardware Semiconductor device Pentium M John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Internet fraud Power supply MOS Technology Second Battle of the Atlantic Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma John Forsythe Johnny 5 Direct current Tooth enamel Multimedia Card Impedance Welding Embedded system Television PHP Computer Gas metal arc welding Torpedo Transformer Kaypro Radio controlled airplane Ignition system Antenna (radio) Internal combustion engine Floppy disk Rail transport modelling Jump start (vehicle)

can i expand my ram on a dell inspiron my laptop already has a mb ddr sdram mhz dimm and another empty slot can i add a mb ddr mhz sodimm ram also can i add a gb ram if i have a mb ram currently installed would it be better to just to buy same mb rams at mhz you can do either however the total ram will only act as fast as the slowest component so mhz dont get unless you are going to replace the altogether the inspiron should support what is called dual channel memory meaning that if you have identical ram cards they will perform much better than any other configuration you can add the gb and then have mb ram but again it will only act as slow as mhz and you will not have dual channel functionality also if the other computer parts like the processor dont have a bus speed faster than mhz there is little to no point in taking the ram up any higher than this however if the processeor has a mhz bus it may be worth looking at there is no guarantee that sodimm will work on your machine however we already know that regualar dimm will check with dell my suggestions buy a nd identical card mb dimm for gb dual channel memory or buy new gb check the processor dimm for dual channel gb memory also before deciding on the gb option make sure with dell that your system will recognise cards that are gb in size alternatively try x mb cards  DDR SDRAM PowerPC Radeon Dynamic random access memory PlayStation 2 IBM PC DDR2 SDRAM Power Macintosh G3 Atari 8-bit family Pentium 4 Apple II family Opteron Central processing unit PC Engine Computer bus Rambus Apple Macintosh IBook CPU cache Overclocking Xeon Athlon VIA Technologies PowerBook IBM Personal System/2 Dell Axim CPU design ATI Technologies Risc PC Windows XP Front side bus Sound Blaster System/36 Windows 2000 GeForce 6 Series Universal Serial Bus Nintendo GameCube Sharp Zaurus Apple IIGS Atari ST RISC PlayStation 3 Timeline of computing 1990-forward Celeron Data General Nova 64-bit IPAQ Oscilloscope MIPS architecture Acorn Electron Xbox 360 Redundant array of independent disks EMac USB flash drive Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Power Mac G4 System/34 Texas Instruments TI-99/4A CDC 6600 Athlon 64 Acorn Computers INMOS Transputer Cray-1 Super Nintendo Entertainment System 3dfx Sega Saturn Sequent Computer Systems NVIDIA Commodore International Commodore 64 Northbridge (computing) Motorola 68000 Mac OS X MOS Technology 6502 BBC Micro SGI Octane Ethernet HyperTransport AMD Xserve Hard disk Neo-Geo Microprocessor Dance Dance Revolution AmigaOS Radeon X Series Microprogram

pc or mac looking at getting a macbook pro soon just curious as to know what people thought make your points known if you see yourself as an individual get a mac if you prefer to follow the crowd get a pc you can run windows software on your mac although why you'd want to is beyond me admittedly there aren't many games but that should only bother the kiddies i switched to mac years ago after having had pcs for a few years and i have never not once regretted it the os is far more stable you don't need to worry about viruses and at the end of the day when i've shut it down it still looks fabulous on my desk the reason i think that the whole thing just works is that the software on a mac appears to be designed to work together and it is largely very intuitive to master not only that most of the applications mask very powerful software with an easy to use and attractive interface i think flattery is the highest form of compliment and if you take one look at ms windows vista you'll see what i'm talking about the only difference is that vista is out dated and rubbish as for price people say macs are expensive but i just helped a friend buy a computer we looked at dell and what started off as a system ended up costing nearly by the time we had added all the basic gear and software that was missing for a couple of quid more she got an awesome stunning imac intel ghz with everything she needed built in  Mac OS X Apple Macintosh IMac IBM PC compatible Microsoft Windows Windows Vista NeXT History of the graphical user interface Windows XP Timeline of computing 1990-forward Microsoft Office Floppy disk OpenGL History of Microsoft Windows Computer virus Apple Intel transition Apple II family PowerPC Mac OS X v10.4 Operating system Linux X Window System AmigaOS Computer workstation Perl Amiga Mac OS Windows 2000 CPU design Microsoft MAME Personal computer Blue screen of death HyperCard Atari ST Mouse (computing) RISC System 7 (Macintosh) 64-bit IPod CPU cache Mozilla Firefox Computer Konfabulator Common Unix Printing System Microprocessor Wi-Fi Mac OS X v10.2 Supercomputer Mach kernel Radeon Pocket PC Server Linux distribution Stardock PlayStation 3 ATI Technologies Mac OS history Hard disk Atari 8-bit family Thread (computer science) Windows Server 2003 Ethernet Commodore International Apple IIGS Objective-C Mainframe computer MIPS architecture AMD Macintosh Finder Common criticisms of Microsoft Laptop Computer and video games Library (computer science) Digital rights management Timeline of computing Redundant array of independent disks FoxTrot Mac OS 8 Kernel (computer science) PowerBook Oscilloscope CP/M Embedded system OS/2 USB flash drive Peer-to-peer WordPerfect Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Python programming language File system Screenshot Digital audio workstation Unicode Linux kernel

cd burning i'm trying to either burn my play disc for unreal tournament or download the play disc onto my computer so i dont have to keep putting the cd or leaving it in my computer can someone help me with this thanks dze is correct it may not be easy to find but there may be a 'patch' or 'fix' in which the game will initialize without the cd in the drive some games do not put all information on your hard drive even with a full install if the game has cut scenes for instance that is only stored on cd then it will crash without it another way around is to use a back up copy the copy protection may 'see' that it's a copy and will not install the game but may still play off the copy use the original for installation then try playing off the copy otherwise a decent programmer can probably find the line of code to check the cd and remove modify it  Copy protection Computer virus Windows XP Modchip Steam (content delivery) ITunes Digital rights management Patch (computing) Compact disc Unreal Tournament PlayStation 2 DVD Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Windows 2000 Commodore 64 ZX Spectrum System 7 (Macintosh) CPU cache Floppy disk MDAC Resident Evil (video game) MAME Virtual memory Blue screen of death Pretty Good Privacy Apple II family PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Linux Mach kernel Apollo Guidance Computer PlayStation 3 Computer Disk image Rootkit Quantum computer Pointer Video game crash of 1983 Mod (computer gaming) Half-Life 2 IBM PC compatible Debugging Redundant array of independent disks Hot Coffee mod OpenBSD LiveCD Brainfuck Visual Basic Hard disk The Sims 2 Poker jargon Unreal Tournament 2004 Malware Booting Copyleft Xbox Snooker Software bug Starsiege: Tribes Copyright infringement of software IPod Cheating in Counter-Strike Emacs Nintendo 64 Final Fantasy VI Forth programming language Betting (poker) Warez MiniDisc Spyware Knoppix Doom WAD USB flash drive History of Microsoft Windows Fischer Random Chess Covermount Video game music Game programming Software cracking Microsoft Windows Sega Dreamcast Manifold Game programmer Atari 8-bit family World of Warcraft Cache Need for Speed StarCraft Game development STS-61 Texas hold 'em Quake III Arena MSN Messenger Open-source software Censorship in Australia Tribes 2 Nintendo Revolution In The Groove (game) Minesweeper (computer game) Windows Vista

laptop batteries what's the life span how can i extend it i just bought my laptop a week ago brnad new hp and i'm disappointed with the battery life i can maybe get minutes out of it before it craps out i'm not doing anything heavy duty with it what can i do to extend the active time and are there more efficient longer lasting batteries available for purchase hp should have bigger batteries available for purchase in my experience when you buy a laptop unless you tell them differently they'll ship the machine with the small battery pack if you want the bigger one you have to tell them specifically it might also depend on what you consider to be heavy duty as far as power usage is concerned spinning a drive is a heavy duty task so if you're doing something like watching a dvd the batteries won't last as long even so minutes sounds like it's on the short side as battery lifespans go if hp says their laptop batteries are supposed to last longer say something like hours maybe you should ask them about the battery life you're getting as well as about buying a bigger battery you might have a warranty issue to attend to as well as a purchase to make good luck to you and hope all goes well  Laptop IBM PC compatible IPod IBook Atari ST Overclocking Lithium ion battery PlayStation Portable Battery electric vehicle PowerBook Toyota Prius Bicycle lighting Apple Macintosh Heinkel He 100 Television commercial USS Tunny (SS-282) Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Craps Incandescent light bulb Hard disk Digital photography Windows XP ZGMF-1017 GINN Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Hybrid vehicle Warranty Television Gramophone record PowerBook G3 Desktop computer Liquid crystal display Heinkel He 112 USS Ammen (DD-527) Sears Holdings Corporation USS Vincennes (CA-44) National Weather Service USS New Jersey (BB-62) Airsoft Xbox 360 Norwegian Campaign Electric vehicle USS Wichita (CA-45) Energy development 8 mm video format Second Battle of the Atlantic Universal Serial Bus Floppy disk Game Boy Advance SP DVD Oasis (band) USS Washington (BB-56) Alan Arnett McLeod Amiga USS Twining (DD-540) Cruising (maritime) USS Uhlmann (DD-687) USS Thompson (DD-627) Macintosh Portable USS Yorktown (CV-10) USS Zane (DD-337) Personal computer PowerPC USS Waller (DD-466) USS Threadfin (SS-410) AlphaSmart Equine conformation Submarine ThinkPad Electric boat Immortality Torpedo USS Wasp (CV-7) Internal combustion engine Solar power Annuity USS Toledo (CA-133) USS The Sullivans (DD-537) USS West Virginia (BB-48) Redundant array of independent disks Internal ballistics Computer forensics World Championship Wrestling USS Alfred A.

general laptop question i'm looking into buying a new laptop and was wondering what brands models people thought were the best i don't need anything particularly fancy i mainly just use it for internet music storage and word processing i currently have a dell which has served me fairly well although now it's incredibly slow even after defrag and checking for spyware and i get the occasional blue screen of death thanks well to my knowledge dell has a large problem with blue screening even after a brand new purchase of a dell laptop my girlfriend had a blue screen times the first day she used it along with other friends who have them they have been a problem gateway is a good brand i have a gateway and have experienced a few problems but my warranty covered everything everyone has their own opinion i'd just say steer clear from hp and dell look on websites for reviews is another suggestion  Windows XP Laptop IBM PC compatible IPod Commodore International Spyware Desktop computer Digital audio player Oscilloscope Floppy disk Best Buy Surveillance Dell, Inc.

my toshiba laptop doesn't want to start up what's wrong with it when it's running my laptop works fine and doesn't seem particularly quirky but when i shut it down it doesn't want to wake up it will wake up from standby and hibernate but it often has trouble going into those modes and instead freezes up and then i have to shut it down anyway and whenever i shut it down i get a blank screen at start up the screen is clearly lit but it's just black if i plug in an external monitor it just shows me the toshiba start up screen but doesn't do anything so i just keep turning it off and turning it back on again until it finally works sometimes it takes hours to work but once it starts working it will stay working until i shut it down again and then it won't restart if it helps i believe i had over heating problems when my fan got blocked up with lint i cleared that out and the fan works better now but i think this may have fried something so what's wrong with my laptop you need to get the computer store let them take a look if tyhey say it wont start up then they will say i have to fix and you need to pay order to get it fixs  Laptop Windows XP IBM PC compatible Universal Serial Bus Halting problem Thermal power station IPod Liquid crystal display Embedded system Escape from New York Bob and George Floppy disk Commodore 64 Commodore International Blue screen of death Screenshot Apollo Guidance Computer Color PowerBook Piccolo Junior Saga Atari ST Palm OS Mouse (computing) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Oscilloscope Toyota Prius Winning Streak Rose (Doctor Who) Toshiba Nuclear reactor Coming of Age (TNG episode) Thermostat Carburetor Personal computer Virtual memory Opera (web browser) System/36 System/34 Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Dance Dance Revolution Lithium ion battery Friends Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Atari 8-bit family Bluetooth The Price Is Right Computer forensics Indianapolis 500 New York Giants Surveillance Screensaver Ben Johnson (athlete) Sinclair ZX81 Cell (microprocessor) Timeline of computing 1990-forward 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Miss Saigon Hybrid vehicle Desktop computer The Arsenal of Freedom (TNG episode) Mega Man VII Secure Digital card Booting Computer animation AmigaOS Flash memory Reading spark plugs for racing CPU design ReBoot Shaggy dog story The Prisoner Smalltalk Public Eye Oplan Bojinka Sonic the Hedgehog Knight Rider Saved by the Bell C programming language Hewlett-Packard HAL 9000 InterCity Express Satchel Paige Game Boy Top League Game Boy Advance SP PowerBook G4 2003 North America blackout History of Microsoft Windows Bad Wolf Nuclear power Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Futurama (TV series - season 4) Vacuum tube Prostate cancer Apple Computer Futurama (TV series - season 5) Poker jargon Sega Dreamcast Apollo 13

laptop battery when using mains on laptop is it better to remove battery yes and no you see if your battery is fully charged and you keep the mains on there still a weak flow of energy flowing you would be better advised to remove the battery but i would not leave it long time fully charged as this is still not a good idea what i would do is unplug the mains and let your laptop battery do some work run to almost empty at least times to fully work your battery then partly recharge it before taking it out but you need to work it every two weeks if you do not it will start to fail it amazes me why people buy laptops and never use the battery until it to late  Laptop Lithium ion battery Battery (electricity) Toyota Prius IBM PC compatible Nickel-cadmium battery Battery electric vehicle Second Battle of the Atlantic IPod Nickel metal hydride Lithium ion polymer battery Volt Lead-acid battery Hybrid vehicle Uninterruptible power supply Fuel cell Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Energy Electric boat Protoss Bicycle lighting Cruising (maritime) AlphaSmart Airsoft ATI Technologies Oscilloscope Handheld game console Background history of the September 11, 2001 attacks Ford Ranger EV ZAFT Armed Keeper of Unity IBook Baseball Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 PowerBook Internal combustion engine Game Boy Advance SP Pentium M Thermal power station Thermostat Hybrid Synergy Drive GED Hard disk Dialysis Smoke detector Jack plug Torpedo 2003 North America blackout Action potential Weapons of Star Trek Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II General Motors EV1 Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Halo: Combat Evolved Jump start (vehicle) USS Washington (BB-56) Macintosh Portable Green Lantern Portable computer PlayStation Portable Energy development Universal Serial Bus Electrical generator Nintendo DS Electricity Sega Items in the Metroid series Diode 2005-06 A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Great Britain Floppy disk Digital photography Jet engine Energy storage Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Automobile Green Lantern Corps USS Texas (BB-35) Infusion pump Windows XP Vacuum tube BattleTech technology Computer forensics Heat Wind turbine USS Terry (DD-513) STS-106 Battle of Worth USS Woolsey (DD-437) Xbox 360 USS S-38 (SS-143) Game Boy Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis West Side Highway AC Propulsion tzero Flash memory Capacitor Battle of Mokra InterCity Express Autonomous building Desknote

my niece is going to college and she needs a computer should i get her a laptop or notebook computer i'm going to assume that by notebook you mean desktop i hope i'm not wrong in that laptops are awesome for college students it allows them to take notes quickly and comfortably during class and allow for really easy search and find functions when reviewing their notes however you need to ask her what all she'll be using it for personally i used my computer for a lot more when i was at college gaming programming watching tv etc for those types of things a laptop that would be powerful enough gets very expensive very quickly desktops have the distinct advantage there i went my whole college career with only a desktop in my room and the old fashioned pen and paper in the classrooms and did just fine however i do see that a laptop would have been a really nice luxury in short find out what she wants a computer for if it will mainly be used for taking notes and instant messaging spring for the laptop it'll be more convenient but if she wants a graphics card a bunch of memory and a ton of storage for games videos music it may be a lot more economical to get a good desktop  Laptop IBM PC compatible Personal computer Desktop computer Computer PowerBook Windows XP Apple Macintosh Windows Vista History of Microsoft Windows ATI Technologies Computer hardware Commodore 64 Universal Serial Bus Hard disk Floppy disk Atari ST Wi-Fi Desknote Linux Microprocessor IMac Supercomputer CPU design Linked list Computer bus Notebook Radeon OpenGL Musical Instrument Digital Interface RISC Computer virus Mouse (computing) Computer and video games Expert system Calculator Oscilloscope Bluetooth Atari 8-bit family Google Desktop PC Engine Internet AmigaOS Crown Court 2D computer graphics Digital photography Apple IIGS Desktop publishing Read-only memory IBM PC Pretty Good Privacy Cruising (maritime) PlayStation 3 Bubble Bobble ThinkPad Stereoscopy Palm OS Wearable computer Portable Document Format Lisp programming language University of Massachusetts Amherst Java programming language Mach kernel BASIC programming language GNOME Graphics card Extreme Programming Graphics processing unit The Inside Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Windows 2000 Computer forensics America Online IBook Halting problem Machinima GED PLATO Computer workstation Acadia University Google Bridgewater State College Embedded system Computer and video game genres Memory card Screenshot One-time pad PostScript Internet fraud Pentium M Video game music X Window System USB flash drive Object Desktop Burroughs B5000

if you already have your laptop what is the least expensive wifi internet connection i have dial up desktop service now and it's so cheap i'm spoiled as per colinic's post you have a misconception that wifi can be subscribed like dialup well it can be provided you live in an area that has it in general internet service providers isps sell types of internet access to home users dialup and broadband dialup is what you are using currently broadband can be either adsl dsl or cable if you live in an area with wifi coverage then you can also subscribe to wifi access if you have wifi coverage at home you can subscribe to that but it wont be very cheap i assume your laptop has wifi capability but if not getting a wifi pcmcia card is not an expensive issue these days if you dont have wifi coverage at home then you will need to subscribe to broadband with your isp and also buy a wifi broadband router if it does not come free with your internet broadband subscription wireless is not worth it to run from your existing dialup connection although it can also be done and will be costly your laptop as usual will need to have wifi capability or else plug in a wifi pcmcia card finally you will need to configure your wifi router and your wifi on your laptop to communicate with each other and then you are set to go 'portable' within your own home  Internet service provider Voice over IP Wireless LAN WiMAX Hotspot (wifi) Dial-up access Cable television Laptop Eircom Telephone Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Telstra Telegraphy Broadband Wireless community network GSM services Modem Power line communication Digital divide Asynchronous Transfer Mode Television Global System for Mobile Communications Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection PlayStation 2 Bluetooth BT Group plc Xbox Windows XP Integrated Services Digital Network Differentiated services Telkom Router Universal Serial Bus Ethernet StarHub IBM PC compatible Desktop computer Cable modem Floppy disk UK telephone numbering plan Q-Telecom Telecom New Zealand HomePNA Communications satellite Skype Verizon Wireless America Online Apple Macintosh Pirate decryption Etisalat NTL Hard disk Nintendo DS Grand Haven, Michigan IBook Local area network Chorus Communications Tesco Computer IP Multimedia Subsystem Windows Vista Password Wireless Usenet Network address translation Private branch exchange Alcatel Mobile phone Dialer AT&T Denial-of-service attack Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Computer bus Telephone exchange IPTV USB flash drive Quality of service North American Numbering Plan Sega Dreamcast Virtual private network MSN TV Computer hardware

why does my laptop do this every time i watch an animated movie on my laptop the lighter images leave long lasting shadows on the darker areas of the animation why does this happen it gets annoying and it's hard to ignore is there something i can do to make it stop that's odd how old is your laptop there is an effect called ghosting or shadowing that occurs if your lcd monitor has a slow response rate does the same thing happen when you play games if you get the same problem playing games that have a lot of animation it's probably your lcd that's causing the problem if you don't have the problem playing games it's probably your video playing software  Liquid crystal display Screensaver Laptop Oscilloscope PowerBook Liquid crystal display television Computer animation Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis PlayStation 2 Windows XP Universal Serial Bus Rendering (computer graphics) Bluetooth Digital photography Hard disk Sega Saturn PlayStation Portable Television Pixel Handheld game console Cathode ray tube IBook Color Floppy disk Shadowrun Pitaten Computer display Persistence of vision Stereoscopy Atari ST Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Computer TFT LCD Causality Zerg Blue screen of death Spider-Man (games) Air traffic control Cheating in Counter-Strike Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Decompression sickness Chaos Emerald Computer bus IPod Mouse (computing) Counter-Strike Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Game Boy RuneScape weapons America Online Internet Nintendo Interlace Super Nintendo Entertainment System CPU cache Debugging BloodRayne Tag Wood Dog Surveillance Blood (computer game) Game Boy Advance Video game controversy Atari 8-bit family Xbox Yu-Gi-Oh!

hp pavillion tx vs macbook i have been a pc user for a few years and was planning on buying my first pc laptop but then i came across the new macbooks because of my budget i would have to get a very inexpensive laptop so would the mac or the pc be better choose for me i was looking for the following things in a laptop light mobile good for surfing the web and running basic programs reliable low maintenence okay graphics okay amount of memory and i also wanted to know if everyone else in my family had a pc would i still be able to send them pictures and things like that it's a matter of personal taste which you would prefer a mac or a pc nowadays a mac can run windows natively by using 'boot camp' which is a download from the internet that allows the mac to switch boot between windows and mac osx it's one of the better options for people who don't like windows too much and the constant need for 'cleaning' and maintaining their pc because of the constant threat of viruses and spyware too common on windows machines as with exchange of files that go on the internet like bmp tiff and mp these should be okay as they're supported if it's pc programs that are only available on a pc but not a mac then you'll have difficulty but as i said you can run them under bootcamp and these files can still be exchanged whilst in pc mode note the pc running on the mac intel machines run natively and are not virtual programs so the performance is exactly like a pc machine there is also another way to run pc on a mac using the program from connectix which is called 'parallels' that enable you to run both windows and mac at the same time however the mac and pc will share the ram and harddrive so will run a bit slower the pc will run under emulation but you're looking for an inexpensive laptop on a budget which might rule you out for a mac sorry  Mac OS X Windows XP Linux Microsoft Windows Computer virus Apple Macintosh IBM PC compatible Windows 2000 Hard disk AmigaOS Laptop Computer History of Microsoft Windows System 7 (Macintosh) Windows Vista Apple Intel transition Windows 3.x X Window System Apple II family Operating system MS-DOS Mac OS PowerPC Bluetooth Kazaa Commodore 64 Java programming language Mouse (computing) PlayStation Portable Thread (computer science) IPod OS/2 DOS Virtual memory Peer-to-peer Floppy disk Timeline of computing 1990-forward Trusted computing Skype X86 Personal computer Atari ST CPU design Windows Server 2003 Emacs Mac OS X v10.4 Microsoft Office Microsoft .NET Musical Instrument Digital Interface MAME Ethernet Acorn Electron Embedded system Visual Basic Mozilla Firefox ATI Technologies Computer multitasking Sun Microsystems USB flash drive History of the graphical user interface WordPerfect Microprocessor NeXT MIPS architecture Windows 2.0 64-bit Redundant array of independent disks Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis RISC Central processing unit Perl Data General Nova Radeon Microsoft Virtual PC ITunes Opera (web browser) Macintosh Finder Forth programming language CPU cache Kernel (computer science) File system ZX Spectrum Comparison of web browsers Architecture of Windows 2000 NX bit Screenshot History of operating systems Objective-C AMD64 File Transfer Protocol Microsoft

hard drive rpm affect gaming i'm soon going to get a dell inspiron mostly for media and gaming question is if i upgrade the hard drive from rpm to rpm both are gb sata hard drives would i notice any significant difference while playing games and or in general and will there be any side effects like uses more battery power etc note laptop will have mb nvidia geforce m gt and gb ram if that helps any getting intel core duo t ghz mhz fsb mb cache a t an gt and gigs should be a extremely good setup for a the rpm is only good if you want faster load times but game performance will be exactly the same if you need to sacrifice anything because of money this is the order you should do it downgrade hard drive to rpm downgrade memory to gig but keeping in mind that adding an additional gig in the future is a must downgrade processor to anything lower than the t downgrade video card this is a last resort option only and no battery should not be affected that much by a rpm hard drive probably no more than minutes if it's used regularly  Pentium 4 PowerBook ATI Technologies Apple Macintosh Athlon Radeon Pentium M Hard disk Celeron PlayStation 3 PowerPC Overclocking Xbox 360 IBook Xbox NVIDIA Xeon CPU cache Laptop PC Engine Pentium III GeForce 4 IBM PC PowerBook G4 IBM PC compatible Floppy disk Atari ST GeForce 2 Redundant array of independent disks Windows XP NForce4 Radeon X Series AMD 3dfx ZX Spectrum Nintendo 64 Windows Vista PlayStation Portable Front side bus Apple II family Xserve PlayStation 2 Graphics card Central processing unit ThinkPad Pentium D RISC Toyota Prius PowerPC G4 Windows 2000 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis GeForce FX MIPS architecture Power Macintosh G3 Nintendo Revolution Personal computer Atari 8-bit family Itanium 2 Timeline of computing 1990-forward Turbocharger Graphics processing unit DDR2 SDRAM Acorn Archimedes Cyrix CPU design GeForce Doom 3 Sega Dreamcast Far Cry Game Boy Amstrad CPC EMac MIM-23 Hawk Gramophone record Mandriva Linux Sega Saturn Mac OS X VIA C3 NForce2 Sharp Zaurus Optimization (computer science) Moore's law X86 assembly language VIA Technologies GeForce 7 Series Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Sinclair ZX81 Dual-core The Sims 2 IA-32 Super Nintendo Entertainment System TRS-80 Serial ATA Commodore 128

is the palm foleo a good laptop replacement the foleo is small has a boot time of zero wifi and bluetooth real world hr battery life depending if wifi and bluetooth are on or not for a reasonable at launch laptops are generally larger heavier and have a significantly worse battery life or are much more expensive than the foleo you also have to wait for a laptop to boot up shutdown before and after use however with a laptop you can obviously run applications you are already comfortable with windows office etc and play dvds and games if you choose the foleo appears to be very easy to use and will probably have a great range of software available in the next year or two but when it is first released it will really be about basic document spreadsheet powerpoint editting email internet calendar and music player through a combination of already announced third party software and built in applications if you already have a desktop pc and are looking for something to allow you to do work when not at home i think the foleo will be a great option if you currently use a laptop as your only computer i doubt the foleo will be able to fill your needs at least in the next twelve months  Laptop IBM PC compatible Wi-Fi Windows XP Bluetooth Microsoft Office Apple Macintosh Windows Mobile Microsoft Windows Windows Vista Pocket PC OpenOffice.org IPod Atari ST PowerBook Radeon Desktop computer IMac Linux Mouse (computing) IPAQ Sun Microsystems Personal computer Computer virus Mac OS X History of Microsoft Windows Tungsten Handheld Microsoft AmigaOS Apple Computer Redundant array of independent disks Computer N-Gage Stardock Apple II family USB flash drive Palm OS ATI Technologies Application software Desknote Verizon Wireless Commodore 64 PlayStation Portable Floppy disk Windows Server 2003 Object Desktop Microprocessor Macromedia Flash Windows 2000 Dance Dance Revolution MAME Kaypro Portable Document Format PlayStation 3 Musical Instrument Digital Interface System 7 (Macintosh) Blue screen of death GNOME Microsoft Excel ZigBee Timeline of computing 1990-forward SUSE Linux History of the graphical user interface Wipeout (game) Toyota Prius Knoppix Pretty Good Privacy Simputer Apple Intel transition Computer forensics KDE Java programming language Voice over IP OpenDocument Wintel Symbian OS Mac OS history NeXT Sharp Zaurus Atari 8-bit family Broadband Internet access History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Konfabulator OpenGL Advanced Squad Leader CPU design OpenBSD Mac OS X v10.4 Nintendo DS Netscape Communications Corporation Transmeta Computer role-playing game Mozilla Firefox MSN Messenger

laptop's keyboard some of the keys on my laptop aren't working properly they type a number instead of a letter does anyone knows how to fix it thanks well i'm not sure if this is what is wrong in your case but on some laptops and on almost all new ones there is a button used to access certain options such as changing the brightness of the screen by just holding this button down and pressing the other button down for example the button on my laptop is labeled as fn and is located between control ctrl and the windows button on the left side of the keyboard when i hold it down and then press the key it mutes the computer anyways what could be happening is that either the button is stuck or you are pressing it and then hitting the u key and it would type a instead of a u if this is true then try to pull the key out and re insert it  Mouse (computing) Computer keyboard Laptop Keyboard layout Floppy disk IBM PC keyboard Windows XP Control key Blue screen of death PowerBook Game controller Windows 2000 Modifier key AmigaOS Beatmania IIDX Dance Dance Revolution Common User Access Option key IBM PC compatible WordStar IPod Oscilloscope Universal Serial Bus Unicode System/34 Function key Screenshot Control character Amiga Accordion Emacs Cheating in Counter-Strike Diacritic Visual Basic Mac OS X v10.4 Slot machine Desktop computer Microsoft Windows System/36 TRS-80 Touchpad Atari 8-bit family Control-Alt-Delete Dash Windows Vista Spy Hunter Computer Vim (text editor) Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas C64 Direct-to-TV Manual transmission Danger Hiptop Dvorak Simplified Keyboard Sega Saturn QWERTY Control Panel (Windows) Opera (web browser) Resident Evil (video game) Elevator Enigma machine Konami Code Gradius Typewriter Nintendo Entertainment System Poker jargon IBook USB flash drive COMMAND.COM Personal computer IBM PC PlayStation Portable Bluetooth Password Digital Apple typography Liquid crystal display Pop'n Music Nintendo Revolution Apostrophe (mark) Keyboard technology Palm OS Commodore 128 Switch Object Desktop Computer virus Gmail X Window System Musical Instrument Digital Interface AltGr key Bubble Bobble Apple Macintosh HTML element GNU Screen Minesweeper (computer game) Class (computer science) Hard disk 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Perl File system IMac

laptop without a system restore disc is this normal should i take it back i asked a question similar to this about a backup disc but i guess my parents misunderstood when they went to buy the laptop it's actually a system restore recovery disc so i thought i'd re ask the question just bought a new laptop and it doesn't come with a system restore disc this seems odd to me as most computers i buy come with windows restore discs does vista usually not come w one this is my first vista computer anyway the store wants to make one we haven't opened the box yet my father said the store bestbuy which is usually reliable had a big clearance sale and a lot of the employees were acting funny selling hard like they were cars salesmen telling him they'd take it out of the box to see if it works even though there's a restock fee if box is opened pushing a mouse laptop cover etc should we just take the laptop back or give the for restore disc many laptops and desktops these days are shipped out with what is known as a recovery partition it is functionally the same as the restore disks just that the image is saved to a hidden partition on the hard drive read the users manual and there will be details on how to access this partition and create your own restore cd's for backup in case the hard drive ever fails the salesmen were probably just being pushed by their supervisors to get the machines out to make room for new models they would not charge you a restocking fee for opening it in the store in fact they open the boxes all the time to install software such as antivirus and antispyware programs in the geek squad setup offers they have after they are done they put a sticker over the opening that clearly outlines the restocking fee policy and you are only charged the restocking fee if you break that sticker  Hard disk Laptop Floppy disk Windows Vista Backup Redundant array of independent disks Computer virus Best Buy Apple Macintosh AmigaOS Computer USB flash drive Copy protection Amstrad CPC Atari ST Knoppix PlayStation 2 IPod MAME History of Microsoft Windows Object Desktop Sega Saturn Visual Basic Atari 8-bit family File Allocation Table Personal computer NeXT NTFS Sega Dreamcast Computer hardware IBook Digital rights management Commodore 64 Spyware Apple II family Universal Serial Bus Public-key cryptography Software testing File system SUSE Linux Enterprise content management Surveillance Apple Computer Bluetooth Disk cloning Mac OS X Macintosh Finder Stardock Partition (computing) Booting PowerBook Blu-ray Disc Xbox PlayStation Portable Embedded system IBM PC Wi-Fi OpenGL Desktop computer CPU design Microsoft Windows X Window System Acorn Archimedes Automatic teller machine Virtual memory Amiga Microsoft TRS-80 Pretty Good Privacy 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Disc jockey ITunes Timeline of computing 1990-forward Kaypro Operating system Computer security System/36 America Online Commodore International BIOS Disk image Cache Neopets The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) MySQL TiVo Modchip

which graphics card is better im looking to buy a laptop and im a gamer dont know if i should go with the macbook pro with its nvidia geforce m gt or hp's mb nvidia geforce m gs which is a better computer well because it is a laptop one thing you need to be wary about is the shared memory or hyper memory or something like that it usually say something like this vga xxxxx mb shared if you spot something like this do not buy it means that the vga have mb only if you cut some ram and distributed it for example gb ram with mb vga dedicated up to mb that mean if you want your vga to be you have to cut you ram and add it to vga otherwise it will only be in the end it will be something like this mb ram you transfer mb to vga with mb vga in the end it done nothing vga and ram is working together very closely you cannot got a good frame rate with one and not without the other so look for the one without share memory another thing i don't think macbook is well suited for playing games even if you can use windows on apple well it's just not comfortable imho  ATI Technologies 3dfx Radeon GeForce 4 Graphics processing unit Graphics card Apple Macintosh IBM PC compatible Video Graphics Array GeForce 2 GeForce 6 Series PlayStation 3 GeForce FX Xbox Nintendo GameCube GeForce Windows Vista Doom 3 GeForce 256 DDR2 SDRAM GeForce 7 Series IMac Radeon X Series Computer bus PC Engine History of Microsoft Windows Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic IPAQ GeForce 3 Sega Dreamcast Xbox 360 PCI Express AMD TRS-80 Color Computer Monkey Island Windows XP Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Timeline of computing 1990-forward Far Cry TRS-80 Laptop Apple Computer Random access memory Acorn Archimedes Sequent Computer Systems PowerBook G4 Dawn (demo) History of computer and video games PowerBook Windows 1.0 Mac OS X IPod IBook Personal computer Digital Visual Interface Windows 3.x PlayStation Portable Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within Commodore 64 Display resolution IBM Personal System/2 Power Macintosh G3 Scalable Link Interface Computer and video games Quake Apple II family First-person shooter Overclocking World of Warcraft Amstrad CPC Windows 2000 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Mac mini Atari 8-bit family Microsoft Windows Original Amiga chipset System 7 (Macintosh) ZX Spectrum Sound Blaster Quest for Glory Library (computer science) VIA Technologies Mouse (computing) OpenGL Deus Ex: Invisible War Apple IIGS Super Video Graphics Array Amiga SCUMM FIFA Series RISC Dynamic random access memory Accelerated Graphics Port

what do you look for in a new hard drive i am planning to get a new hard drive for my notebook what should i look for first consider a price range you can buy a descent drive for around and even less second make sure that you find a model that is for a laptop such as ata for most models or serial ata for newer otherwise you'll need an external interface such as usb or firewire to allow it to connect to your laptop third find correct size for your needs too small you'll have to replace sooner too big computers built around and earlier may not support over gb without updates lastly if possible look for drive that have a spindle rate greater than rpm and cache of mb minimum this will enhance the computer's ability to retrieve information at a faster rate  Hard disk Advanced Technology Attachment Universal Serial Bus Computer bus Apple Macintosh IMac Serial ATA IPod SCSI FireWire Windows XP PowerBook Floppy disk PlayStation 2 Personal computer Bluetooth USB flash drive Redundant array of independent disks IBM PC compatible Computer Power Macintosh G3 CompactFlash PowerPC Mouse (computing) Timeline of computing 1990-forward PCI Express Western Digital Atari 8-bit family Desktop computer Apple II family Atari ST Mac OS X Computer hardware CD recorder CPU cache Musical Instrument Digital Interface Cache Seagate Technology Secure Digital card DragonFly BSD Sharp Zaurus Early IBM disk storage Apple IIGS Windows 2000 Xserve ZX Spectrum Radeon Xbox 360 MicroATX TiVo TRS-80 Serial port Commodore International Domain Name System Digital audio player DVD Flash memory Xeon Pentium M Wi-Fi Sound recording A600 Desknote PlayStation 3 IBM PC Serial communications PowerBook G4 CPU design MIPS architecture Xbox Mac mini Virtual memory BIOS ITunes Sega Saturn MIM-23 Hawk USB mass storage device class CD-ROM Gramophone record Memory Stick Linux File system Windows Vista Mozilla Firefox Cheating in Counter-Strike System/36 Compact disc Architecture of Windows 2000 Supercomputer Acorn Archimedes Hybrid vehicle Apollo Guidance Computer PowerBook G3 RS-232

what should i do or not do the couple of times i've tried to play a dvd movie on my lap top it skips jerks the lap top is a inspiron i've had it since december it could possibly be because of the following reasons there is something wrong with your dvd drive your processor is slow you do not have enough ram you do not have a good enough graphics card how to fix you could buy a new dvd drive made specificly for laptops i would suggest if you're not tech savvy to get someone to install it for you if you have a processor that is slower than ghz then i would just suggest to buy a new computer but if you have a processor greater than ghz then your processor is not the problem if you have less than mb ram in your computer i would suggest upgrading or if you have any programs running in the background to exit out of them to make sure that the media player that your using will be able to have enough ram to run i'm not sure how bad a graphics card has to be to not be able to run a dvd but since you bought it not too long ago it should be able to have a good enough graphics card to run it  IBM PC compatible Windows XP Apple Macintosh Personal computer The Sims 2 Mac mini PowerBook Nintendo Revolution IBook Atari ST Windows Vista PlayStation 3 Pentium 4 History of Microsoft Windows IBM PC PlayStation 2 EMac Hard disk Cell (microprocessor) Xbox Overclocking Mac OS X MAME Computer and video games Knoppix Sinclair ZX81 TRS-80 Color Computer Atari 8-bit family Desktop computer Commodore 64 Supercomputer Commodore 128 IPod Apple IIGS AMD ZX Spectrum USB flash drive TRS-80 Apple II family PowerBook G4 Microsoft Windows CPU design ATI Technologies Linux CPU cache Graphics processing unit High-definition television Central processing unit X86 Power Mac G5 64-bit RISC Cyrix TurboGrafx 16 DVD BBC Micro Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Screenshot Windows 3.x Sega Dreamcast Virtual memory IA-32 Timeline of computing 1990-forward Game programming Doom 3 Celeron Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Windows 2000 In The Groove (game) Acorn Electron Timeline of computing Computer bus AmigaOS Mach kernel Computer virus OS/2 Original Amiga chipset The Sims 2: University Nintendo GameCube PaX Apple Newton Moore's law Jet engine Nintendo 64 PC motherboard History of operating systems System/34 MIM-23 Hawk Pentium M

i have a question about notebook memory i upgraded my notebook memory i got the correct memory specificially designed for my notebook i installed it it seems to be working however when i go under my computer and check the properties under ram it still says which was my old ram any idea why the new memory didn't register itself try restarting the machine and bringing up the bios instead of booting normally check to see what it says about your memory if it doesn't see it either then you should try removing and reseating the memory module you can also try reversing the positions of the two modules if it turns out that your machine only sees one stick at a time then they may have incompatible characteristics  Booting Laptop IBM PC compatible Windows XP Commodore 128 Atari 8-bit family Apple Macintosh Hard disk CPU cache Blue screen of death MSX Floppy disk Sinclair ZX81 Computer virus Apollo Guidance Computer BIOS USB flash drive Knoppix Commodore 64 Emulator Atari ST CDC 6600 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Virtual memory Windows 2000 TRS-80 Motorola 68000 Quantum computer ZX Spectrum PowerBook IMac Copy protection IA-32 History of Microsoft Windows C programming language Personal computer 64-bit Original Amiga chipset Commodore PET SAM Coup__ Data General Nova CPU design X86 Compiler optimization Debugging INMOS Transputer Upper Memory Area PlayStation 2 IBM PC Flash memory Nintendo Entertainment System Super Nintendo Entertainment System IBM 1620 Tandem Computers Embedded system System 7 (Macintosh) OS-9 Assembly language Central processing unit Texas Instruments TI-99/4A PC Engine Magnetic core memory Acorn Archimedes Acorn Electron Halting problem Modchip File Allocation Table Common Unix Printing System Random access memory Cray-1 AmigaOS Commodore Plus/4 Burroughs B5000 System/360 Library (computer science) Nintendo GameCube Calculator Apple II family RISC Windows Server 2003 PowerPC TRS-80 Color Computer System/36 Kernel (computer science) IBook Ethernet Fritz-chip Advanced Technology Attachment IBM 700/7000 series CDC 8600 Word (computer science) Computer Cray-2 Redundant array of independent disks Memory (computers) Front side bus The Sims 2 L4 microkernel family IBM Personal System/2

my hp notebook starts up very strange frustrating read on i have a new hp notebook computer running windows vista home premium here is exatly what it does shows the hp bios screen seconds shows the vista start up screen seconds shows the log in screen i enter password everything is going fine untill i log in between the log in and the showing of the desktop the screen stays black with the mouse for about minutes then finally it continues and the desktop pops up very quickly while it's black the hard drive activity indicator light on the notebook is off no hd activity the mouse moves but the screen stays black for about minutes what would cause this note yesterday while it was in that frozen mode i got a real quick message saying rundll has stopped working but after all the trouble everything works okay what would cause this by the way this computer is about month old and i did try the system recovery origonal factory state and it still happens everything here sounds normal actually for most of this process there are windows controls that have their own agenda not a problem it's not unusual to see an error like the rundll has stopped working you'll usually see it during your shutdown routine if you got that error message and it was real quick as you say rather than the one you know where you have to click end now that's fine it's as if the system is looking around for orphans and widows and stragglers and if it finds them it sends them home when it doesn't find a home it freezes up most of the time a complete shut down and cold boot will take care of this if you see the error often and maybe even if you don't you might want the run a registry checker to clear up loose ends also if you've been used to watching windowsxp load on a system with the same processor vista will seem to have issues in more ways than one it's just different that's all anyway if it makes you feel better nothing you've said indicates you have any cause for concern  Windows XP Windows 2000 Mouse (computing) IBM PC compatible Booting Blue screen of death History of Microsoft Windows Apple Macintosh Embedded system Windows Vista Personal computer Microsoft Windows AmigaOS History of the graphical user interface IMac Computer virus System/36 Hard disk Laptop Screenshot X Window System System/34 Floppy disk Atari ST Mach kernel Password Partition (computing) Commodore 64 Apple Computer RISC Domain Name System Computer forensics Doom 3 Prank flash Gmail Desktop computer Windows 3.x Opera (web browser) Apple IIGS E-mail spam RuneScape cheats Minesweeper (computer game) Architecture of Windows 2000 Debugging Power-On Self Test Common Unix Printing System Surveillance ZX Spectrum Master Control Program 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Linux Microsoft Steam (content delivery) Btrieve Windows 95 Windows Server 2003 GunZ The Duel MDAC Virtual memory Diablo II: Lord of Destruction USB flash drive Atari 8-bit family Redundant array of independent disks CPU design Windows Me Toyota Prius OpenBSD Computer ThinkPad OpenGL MS-DOS Hello world program Federal Standard 1037C BIOS Ecco the Dolphin Computer multitasking NeXT Knoppix Spyware X86 assembly language Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Stardock Windows registry PDP-11 Crash (computing) Modem Vostok 1 Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Mercury Atlas 6 Control-Alt-Delete Public-key cryptography Oscilloscope OS/2 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis

ok i have two questions about laptops i use my computer every day it is better when i'm done for the day to have it sleep hibernate or shut down and why is it better to use it until the battery needs charging then do so or just keep it plugged in thanks i just want to maximize my laptop life and would like to know what will help ensure this sleep mode or power off sleep mode uses very little power saves the lcd monitor and the system can quickly come back up unlike starting from a power off state power off allows the system to dissipate heat and some laptop motherboards do get pretty hot after hours of usage hibernate is the worst mode attempting to store the complete system state to the hard disk and then restore it just doesn't work properly far too often it's most practical to leave it plugged in however if you disconnect from ac power and allow it run down to the point where the battery needs charging about once every few days you'll keep the battery well conditioned never allowing the battery to discharge eventually reduces your battery's capacity finally if there are electrical or thunderstorms in your area you should always shut the computer off and unplug it  Laptop Universal Serial Bus Hard disk Windows XP Battery (electricity) Toyota Prius IPod Atari ST Floppy disk Computer forensics Personal computer Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Vacuum tube Liquid crystal display IBM PC compatible 2003 North America blackout Lithium ion battery Commodore 64 Solar power Thermal power station USB flash drive Protoss Redundant array of independent disks Capacitor Spark plug Hybrid vehicle Battery electric vehicle Fuel cell Computer STS-61 X86 assembly language Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Hybrid Synergy Drive Bicycle lighting Jack plug Daylight saving time Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Oscilloscope Apple II family PlayStation Portable Computer hardware PowerBook Microprocessor Renewable energy Atari 8-bit family Mouse (computing) Explosive material Circuit design Nickel-cadmium battery Steam (content delivery) Advanced Technology Attachment BS 1363 National Weather Service Apollo Command/Service Module Apple IIGS Windows 2000 Plug-and-play Nuclear reactor Wi-Fi Central processing unit Carburetor Action potential IBM PC Ford Ranger EV Tesla coil Nintendo DS Macintosh Portable Volt Kaypro PowerBook G3 History of Microsoft Windows Air traffic control Solar panel Surveillance Energy development Computer bus Digital photography Computer virus Canon T90 MiniDisc Game Boy Computer multitasking Wind power Solar cell Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Commodore International Thermostat Apple Macintosh AlphaSmart RISC Xbox 360 Plaintext IMac Internal combustion engine Advance Wars: Dual Strike Fusor

mixing pc and pc ram i need to upgrade the ram on my laptop a compaq evo from its current mb pc i had a couple of pc memory boards on an old broken thinkpad t laptop so i thought i'd try these i'm not really bothered about speed as i only use it for word and web but i expected to maybe get a few odd problems until i go out and buy some pc but the machine wouldn't even boot up not even a screen to tell me that i'm not allowed to do that nothing so naturally i'm worried that there may be some other factor at play maybe different types of ram any factors i should be aware of before i shell out for charles the motherboard of the t was damaged but the ram seemed to be ok the motherboard on the evo is fine the additional memory i borrowed from the t is double sided and only mb for each stick so i am well under the maximum limit for the evo the evo memory is also double sided i didn't realise that single double sided was an issue since catalogues don't list this aspect strangely the evo won't start if it has only the pc memory so the problem is not mixing it's just that the evo doesn't like pc i then tried a mb pc from an even older computer leaving the original mb inside and the evo won't start with that either it seems that the evo really doesn't like pc at all pc pc should be compatible just know that the memory will clock down to the slower speed the only things i can think of that may be causing you problems would be if the number of pins on the memory modules is different from one another probably shouldn't be with that type of memory the pc modules may be bad take out your pc and try booting with just the pc in if it won't boot the memory is likely your problem if it boots fine with the pc that will confirm it the combination of the two memories is more than your systems capacity i tried looking on crucial com but couldn't find the systems in question i would check the manufacturer website for more details  IBM PC compatible Hard disk IBM PC Laptop Atari ST Floppy disk USB flash drive Universal Serial Bus Atari 8-bit family Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis AMD Random access memory ZX Spectrum IA-32 TRS-80 Computer virus Windows XP Windows 2000 CPU cache Super Nintendo Entertainment System PC Engine Overclocking Computer bus Windows Vista Nintendo Entertainment System Commodore 128 MSX DVD Apple II family Oscilloscope PowerBook Atari 2600 Redundant array of independent disks Advanced Technology Attachment Cray-1 Timeline of computing 1990-forward TRS-80 Color Computer PowerPC PlayStation 3 PlayStation 2 ATI Technologies RISC Upper Memory Area CPU design Amiga Apple IIGS Sinclair ZX81 Poker jargon Computer Mouse (computing) Slot machine Ethernet Apollo Guidance Computer INMOS Transputer History of Microsoft Windows Motorola 68000 Burroughs B5000 Data General Nova Cyrix Linux Perl Moore's law Video Graphics Array Cray-2 Digital circuit Booting System/36 Datatype File Allocation Table DR-DOS IBook Acorn Electron DDR2 SDRAM Pentium 4 Surveillance Wintel Spring operating system SAM Coup__ Digital photography Virtual memory Desktop computer Nintendo Revolution RS-232 IMac MOS Technology PC motherboard IBM Personal System/2 Sound Blaster Modchip 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines

opinions should i keep a laptop with no warranty my father has bought a new laptop it's pretty decent has long battery life was told it was hrs unsure about that though vista dvd recorder etc i'd like to use it for classes due to the battery life unfortunately my father got it at a bargain deal that's all he'll ever shop for and the warranty is estimated at about the cost of the laptop itself due to this my father said he won't take out a warranty on it i feel uncomfortable with saving important files on a laptop that i'll be carrying around knowing that if something happens to it then that'll be it my father who never uses computers doesn't understand my concern with saving files onto a computer that he says we can just throw away if it breaks your opinions should i refuse to use it or try it out i'm not accident prone or anything like that but i figure there's always bound to be a problem occur update i m not complaining i am merely being precautious there is a big difference between the two most warrantees arent that great anyway you can store your work on discs or memory sticks keep the lt and just use it senseably no games music pics  Laptop IBM PC compatible Digital photography Warranty PlayStation Portable Best Buy MiniDisc IPod PlayStation 3 USB flash drive Theory of conduct Mouse (computing) IBook Digital rights management Computer virus Computer forensics Radeon Computer PowerBook Apple Macintosh Hard disk Windows Vista Floppy disk Battery (electricity) Gramophone record UK Singles Chart Flash memory Bluetooth Blu-ray Disc GunZ The Duel CPU cache Oplan Bojinka PlayStation 2 Digital audio player Universal Serial Bus Pretty Good Privacy Game Boy Advance SP Lithium ion battery Ty Cobb Mac OS X DVD Verizon Wireless Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Inside PowerBook G3 Grey market Loss leader 1957 World Series Copyleft Implied warranty Apple Computer C programming language Laserdisc F-16 Fighting Falcon TurboGrafx 16 Computer and video games Walkman Scenes from a Memory Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Nintendo Revolution Password (video games) Business process reengineering John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Knoppix Karaoke Internet Disk image Appeal Microeconomics Annuity Initial D Copy protection Virtual memory MP3 ITunes Newsgroup Surveillance Microsoft Windows PowerBook G4 Saturday Night Live InterCity Express Earth Girl Arjuna Characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion Deed Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina ITunes Music Store Eddie Guerrero ATI Technologies Friends Digital circuit Big Brother (USA TV series) CD recorder PNG Embedded system Gaia Online Toyota Prius Final Fantasy XI Tamper resistance

which type of docking would be best thanks for helping i'm going to college and i am purchasing a dell latitude d notebook i want to buy a dock but i'm not sure which would be the best there is a lot of computer jargon that i'm really not familiar with here are the options d port advanced port replicator d dock expansion station d family monitor stand d view notebook stand i'm leaning towards the first one but do anyone have an idea of the differences and can give me some hint about how to choose thanks so much for your time the advanced port looks like a good unit if you want an external keyboard and mouse this will allow it even if you get asmall screen and want a larger monitor this provides quick connection i have only seen an advantage to a docking station in the use of connecting the printer and larger monitor in an office environment for an individual there is little benefit for cost it is not something you can move around easily and most college students don't always sit at the desk to use their system with campus wireless they go to the common room next door the library etc with their system to do work  Apple Macintosh IMac Mouse (computing) Computer Personal computer Digital photography System/36 Universal Serial Bus Amiga Floppy disk Commodore 64 Nintendo Revolution Atari ST AirPort IBM PC compatible Amstrad CPC PowerBook Apple IIGS AmigaOS Windows 2000 Desknote Wearable computer Common Unix Printing System ZX Spectrum Stereoscopy IPod Apple II family System/34 Information Technology Infrastructure Library Typewriter PostScript Embedded system Scarborough RT (TTC) Tablet PC Logo programming language Emerson College History of the graphical user interface Commodore PET Bridgewater State College Redundant array of independent disks Mac OS X v10.4 Commodore International TRS-80 Color Computer Crown Court Fire alarm control panel Game controller Apple typography Management information system Surveillance Hampton Roads University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Windows XP Mac OS X Advance Wars: Dual Strike American University Mapua Institute of Technology Computer and video games Nintendo History of Microsoft Windows Microsoft ThinkPad Game programmer Sharp Zaurus Mach kernel Education in Germany Nintendo GameCube Texas Instruments TI-99/4A CPU cache X Window System Microsoft Windows KIM-1 Object-oriented programming Hard disk Information Services Procurement Library D-subminiature Apple Newton University of York Parachuting Education in the United States Screenshot Computer hardware University of Michigan Nintendo DS Economics University of Massachusetts Amherst Game Boy Advance BASIC programming language PlayStation 3 Microeconomics Ethernet Bluetooth MapleStory

how can i find out the clock speed of my video ram on my laptop i have a laptop with a nvidia geforce m gt with video ram please do not get this confused with system ram i want to know if this is ddr memory or gddr memory and the best way for me to do that is to figure out either the clock speed on it should either be mhz or mhz or the bandwidth on it should be gb s or gb s this is for a laptop so i know a lot of programs will not tell me the correct information because they are designed for a desktop thanks no its not i've actually read through those forums before and have heard about all the dell problems combatid nvidia does a very strange thing for this video card they let the manufacture decide on what kind of video ram to use so there are mb versions mb versions and even mb versions this also lets the manufacture decide on the type of ram to use so any of these could be ddr or gddr each of which have different performances if i am not mistaken ddr cannot handle being clocked higher than mhz and gddr higher than mhz i am trying to figure out if i have ddr gddr or a underclocked version of one of those ok i did a search for you but the results are a little odd i could not find a nvidia geforce m gt with m video ram but i did find a mb version the links are below you could also try downloading a free program called pc wizard at http www cpuid org i am sure that under the video summary it will give you all the correct specs on the card installed good luck  ATI Technologies NVIDIA PlayStation 3 PowerPC GeForce 4 DDR2 SDRAM GeForce 2 DDR SDRAM GeForce FX GeForce 6 Series Xbox Overclocking Laptop Commodore 64 Windows Vista Bluetooth GeForce 256 Atari ST PlayStation 2 IMac Pentium 4 IBM PC compatible PCI Express Dynamic random access memory OpenGL PowerBook GeForce 3 MOS Technology 6502 Commodore 128 IBM PC Super Nintendo Entertainment System Timeline of computing 1990-forward CPU cache Random access memory Windows XP Xbox 360 GeForce 7 Series Graphics card Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME CPU design Computer Universal Serial Bus Atari 8-bit family Celeron Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis TRS-80 Dance Dance Revolution HyperTransport Cyrix USB flash drive RDRAM Cell (microprocessor) VIA Technologies Northbridge (computing) World of Warcraft Pentium M Apple II family Computer bus IBook Nintendo GameCube NForce EMac Supercomputer NForce2 Mac OS X Windows 2000 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Wi-Fi Athlon 64 Graphics processing unit Floppy disk OpenBSD Nintendo Entertainment System Motorola 68000 Hard disk AMD DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX PC Engine The Sims 2 Radio Power Macintosh G3 Windows Mobile Central processing unit Front side bus Opteron Rambus TI-83 series Read-only memory Xeon Oscilloscope StepMania IPod

is it not a good idea to keep your ac adapter plugged in all the time i usually have the ac adapter charger for my laptop plugged in all the time is this not a good idea will it cause it to break or get worn out faster it is not a good idea but not for the reasons stated above your computer will not wear down any faster or have any real harm on it unless you have a short or lightning strikes of course but it will have a bad affect on your battery's life what will shorten the life of lithium ion batteries the fastest is keeping it fully charged and at high temperatures the best thing you can do for your battery is to keep it at about a charge and keep it in a cool not freezing dry area what you should also do to keep your battery life up is to frequently charge your small laptop in small doses keeping it at a charge or so fully discharge and charge the battery once a month or every th charge cycle that last part is only true for lithium ion batteries in devices such as laptops  Lithium ion battery Laptop Battery (electricity) Nickel metal hydride Lithium ion polymer battery Battery electric vehicle IPod Nickel-cadmium battery Nuclear fusion Universal Serial Bus PowerBook Toyota Prius Game Boy Advance SP Hard disk Spacecraft propulsion Turbocharger Carburetor Spark plug Circuit design Diode Thermal power station Lithium Nuclear weapon design Fusor Internal ballistics Fusion power Galileo spacecraft Atari ST Bicycle lighting Membrane potential Airsoft Electrophysiology Action potential Jack plug Fire extinguisher USB flash drive National Weather Service Rocket fuel IBM PC compatible Current (electricity) Game Boy Advance Teller-Ulam design CPU cache Radiation hardening Athlon Lead-acid battery Haloalkane Ford Ranger EV Vacuum tube Vacuum Capacitor Directed-energy weapon Wind turbine Tesla coil Geomagnetic storm Atomic clock Read-only memory Computer High-voltage hazards Service life Ion thruster IBM PC Second Battle of the Atlantic Cruising (maritime) Windows XP Oscilloscope Explosive material Computer bus Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Lightning Protoss Volt Personal computer Items in the Metroid series Ammonia Supercomputer Spark gap RISC Water Technetium Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Mass spectrometry Radiosurgery Engine cooling Menstrual cup CompactFlash PlayStation Portable Urinary incontinence Tire Electric boat Atari 8-bit family Electrostatic discharge Floppy disk Watch Quantum computer FireWire

can intel graphics media accelerator run these my dad is getting me a hp pavillion dv and it has the intel graphics media accelerator i know its not a dedicated graphic card and its okay with me i don't intend to play games on my laptop anyway i've got my desktop for that still i'm curious if it can run warcraft iii photoshop and adobe flash i've got gig of ram and it runs on vista would upgrading it to gigs help for those program and last would you guys happen to know if i can upgrade the graphic card on my laptop or am i stuck with it thanks in advance my laptop has the exact same graphics card as far as programs like photoshop flash it can handle anything like that fine but it certainly is not a gaming card it'll crash playing new d games beyond the lowest graphics settings i havn't tried warcraft iii but it's a few years old and i've gotten newer games to work alright set to graphics to low and should be decent but again don't plan on doing any serious gaming and down the line upgrading a graphics card on a laptop usually isn't worth it personally i use my desktop for gaming i've never found laptops very comfortable to play seriously with anyways btw more ram never hurts i'm not a vista fan myself check out ubuntu linux but if you must use vista with this graphics card i strongly recommend setting windows decoration to classic  IBM PC compatible Apple Macintosh Windows Vista Windows XP Personal computer Mac OS X Linux Laptop Computer and video games ATI Technologies Microsoft Windows OpenGL History of Microsoft Windows Atari ST PowerPC Radeon Microprocessor Windows 3.x PowerBook Flash memory Knoppix Microsoft Office X86 Bluetooth Amiga Xbox IPAQ IMac Commodore 64 Operating system ZX Spectrum X Window System World of Warcraft History of the graphical user interface Screenshot Macromedia Flash Hard disk Apple II family OS/2 Computer role-playing game Graphic design PlayStation 3 Java programming language Embedded system Pentium 4 Counter-Strike Doom 3 History of computer and video games 64-bit Linux distribution Graphics processing unit Computer workstation Ubuntu Linux Wi-Fi Apple IIGS CompactFlash Acorn Electron ThinkPad Redundant array of independent disks Read-only memory PC Engine Linux kernel MIPS architecture Adobe Photoshop CPU design Wintel RISC TRS-80 USB flash drive Windows Server 2003 Object Desktop Cyrix Universal Serial Bus Mouse (computing) Pocket PC IA-32 Game programmer GIMP PlayStation 2 PaX IPod NVIDIA Sound Blaster BIOS Commodore 128 Atari 8-bit family AmigaOS Space Quest OpenDocument Poker jargon Game Boy Windows 95 GeForce 4

windows vista i was at circuit city the other day and i noticed the prices of computers with windows vista dropped alot i was wondering is it worth it to get one because i also know alot of things aren't yet compatible with vista yet should i wait oh and yes im talking about a laptop okay fact is of the software that is out there will never be compatable with vista and the same can be said for of devices i would not get a laptop right now if i were you unless i ordered one customed with windows xp the fact is laptops designed for vista have graphics that run in directx which is nice and shiny but will never accept any windows before vista so you can't even install xp on a vista laptop microsoft found a nice way to stick it to everyone this time if you're wanting a laptop don't wait xp is becoming a thing of the past because microsoft is forcing contracts on all the big computer companies they've even tried with mine but i won't be bought out at the price their offering me you may still be able to have a custom dell built for you with xp on it but you may have to check on ebay if that is not enough for you try finding a local computer shop and asking them if they can custom laptops for you best of luck  IBM PC compatible Windows Vista Windows XP Microsoft Windows Laptop Mac OS X Apple Macintosh DirectX ATI Technologies History of Microsoft Windows OpenGL Sun Microsystems Windows API Radeon Xbox Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Personal computer PowerBook Windows 2000 USB flash drive Xbox 360 Microprocessor IPod Wintel Mouse (computing) Apple Computer Commodore International Floppy disk Timeline of computing 1990-forward PowerPC Game programming Atari 8-bit family Hard disk Common criticisms of Microsoft Atari ST History of the graphical user interface GeForce 4 MS-DOS NVIDIA Universal Serial Bus Supercomputer Hewlett-Packard History of computing hardware (1960s-present) X Window System Wi-Fi Internet Explorer Computer bus PlayStation 3 AmigaOS Computer Apple Intel transition OS/2 Amiga Computer and video games Mac OS X v10.4 Commodore 64 Windows Presentation Foundation Bluetooth Pocket PC WindowBlinds Network effect CPU design Mozilla Firefox Game programmer MIPS architecture First-sale doctrine Booting System/36 Copy protection United States v.

in a laptop can graphics card be changed like ram i have an intel gma card with mb shared ram is it possible to get it replaced by a gforce one have a standalone ram for your case and most laptops the answer is no your's cannot be changed because it is an integrated graphics card meaning there is no real graphics card in your computer you cannot upgrade graphic cards on most laptops because they are built right on the motherboard for heat space reasons there are in fact some laptops that video cards can be upgraded these laptops use a mxm or later type of connection that lets the user install a graphic card with the same kind of connection but this does not even guarantee you it is upgradeable even if the laptop does have an mxm video card connection that is no guarantee the card will physically fit in the laptop right now very few laptops support this kind of function those being only top of the line laptops like the asus c s or top of the line clevo computers even if you own one of those laptops and can find a card that uses the same type of connection and physically fits in the laptop it is still a poor choice to upgrades because it is extremely expensive it is just best to think of laptops being unupgradeable expcept for ram and the hdd of course  Laptop IBM PC compatible Atari ST Windows XP Personal computer Desktop computer PowerBook Hard disk Windows 2000 Windows Vista Computer ATI Technologies PC Engine History of Microsoft Windows Wi-Fi Apple Macintosh Computer bus Universal Serial Bus Mac OS X v10.4 Bluetooth Mac OS X Radeon Redundant array of independent disks Commodore 64 Floppy disk Graphics card Apple IIGS TRS-80 Color Computer PC motherboard Timeline of computing 1990-forward IMac Graphics processing unit Atari 8-bit family PlayStation 3 IBM PC CPU cache GeForce 6 Series NVIDIA Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis IBook Power Macintosh G3 Xbox Musical Instrument Digital Interface Overclocking Computer hardware Sound Blaster Windows 3.x GeForce 4 Cyrix IPod Commodore 128 AmigaOS Nintendo Revolution PlayStation 2 ZX Spectrum Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Nintendo GameCube AMD IA-32 Sinclair ZX81 Acorn Electron Intel Counter-Strike BBC Micro Object Desktop Apple Intel transition Pentium 4 CPU design Motherboard System 7 (Macintosh) Random access memory PlayStation Portable X Window System Peripheral Component Interconnect PCI Express Sun Microsystems Virtual memory Pentium M Capacitor plague Mac mini Amstrad CPC BIOS Softmodem Dynamic random access memory Commodore PET Modchip Color Graphics Adapter ThinkPad Acorn Computers IPAQ Linux Burroughs B5000 PowerPC Trusted computing S3 Graphics Server Nintendo 64

laptop cover i crocheted a cover for my laptop someone told me today that i shouldn't use the cover when my pc is on for reasons because it can overheat and it will reduce battery life my laptops heat vents are on the side so the over heating is a non issue but if the vents were not on the side would a cover have an effect on it does using a cover make a battery weaker i've searched the net but was unable to find anything about it what do you think first props for being so creative any sort of cover that you put over the computer over vents or not will make it harder for the computer to cool itself laptops run hot to begin with so any excess heat can be damaging and can lead to excessive wear on the internal components battery included i'm not sure exactly how a crocheted cover would affect it but i'd be careful  Laptop Battery (electricity) Lithium ion battery Solar power Spark plug Hard disk Overclocking M16 (rifle) IBM PC compatible Carburetor Jet engine Disc brake PowerBook IBook Explosive material Diving suit Internal combustion engine Engine cooling Hyperthermia Athlon Toyota Prius Capacitor plague Thermal power station Fire fighting Solar cell Autonomous building Floppy disk Heat Vacuum tube Computer forensics Energy development IPod Welding Global warming USB flash drive Cold fusion Diver rescue CPU design Soldering Nuclear power Windows XP Upholstery Combine (Half-Life 2) Microprocessor Internal ballistics Oplan Bojinka Desktop computer Renewable energy Nickel-cadmium battery Motor oil Solar panel Mouse (computing) Severe weather terminology (United States) Fuel cell Manual transmission Space Shuttle external tank Rugby union positions Apple Intel transition Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Pentium M Eldfell Daylight saving time Iron Thermostat Aluminium Computer cooling Sulfuric acid Coffee Universal Serial Bus Ford Ranger EV Hybrid vehicle National Weather Service Water (molecule) Macintosh Portable Scramjet Central processing unit Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Cancer Redundant array of independent disks Dairy Supercomputer PowerBook G3 Tank Wi-Fi Sulfur HVAC Nuclear reactor RISC Steel Bluetooth 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens International response to Hurricane Katrina Furnace Haloalkane PowerBook G4 Hearing aid Hot air balloon Die making ATI Technologies The Long Game

should i overclock my laptop if you are asking this question definitely not laptops are a lot harder to overclock because they already generate a lot of heat and are generally not manufactured with parts intended to be overclocked which generates more heat it's certainly possible but if you are asking the question here instead of on an overclocking forum you should probably leave it alone no offense meant just an observation and honest answer  Overclocking Radeon Laptop Athlon OverClocked ReMix Pentium 4 Computer cooling Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Case modding Modding Universal Serial Bus Celeron PowerBook Internet troll Microprocessor IBM PC compatible Lie Bluetooth GamePark PowerBook G4 AMD K6-III Heat sink Australia's Brainiest Kid Heat ABIT DDR SDRAM Floppy disk Discordianism Charles Goodyear Front side bus Opportunity rover Extreme Programming Video game music Watercooling CPU cooling Hard disk Newbie Advance Wars: Dual Strike Desktop computer RuneScape cheats Quizbowl Physics The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything Scientology beliefs and practices Titanium Theory of conduct Supernatural Apple Intel transition Desknote Current teachings of Prem Rawat Troll (Discworld) Parking lot Mathematics Heat capacity Pentium M Landmark Education Explosive material Wood fuel IBM PC Nick Berg National Weather Service Compaq Cheating in Counter-Strike The Long Game Science SETI@home Adjoint functors Refrigerator Chemical reaction ATI Technologies NiGHTS Into Dreams Joke Hydrogen Hewlett-Packard IP (complexity) Charles Erwin Wilson Personal computer Handloading Ronald D.

my laptop screen is damaged ideas on cheap replacement also how to measure screen size for replacement my toshiba laptop screen has been damaged i have found screens available on ebay but want to make sure i know the correct screen size do you measure just from corner to corner of the actual screen or do you measure the entire laptop top if that makes any sense because there is a border around the screen know what i mean i'm a poet and didn't know it okay how do i make sure i get the correct make model and everything i need to get the right replacement screen is there something from the laptop i can access that will give me all of that as the paperwork from original purchase is not nearly as accessible thanks for the answer it was helpful as far as laptop screens are concerned if you don't get the exact same model and make then it is possible that it wont work they are very specific with their connection so getting one that's not for the same model and make may not work for you measuring monitors are usually from corner to the opposite corner diagonally across starting from where the screen begins not the case update there should be a model number on your laptop somewhere look for that what brand is it look up those two information and look for a laptop on ebay that doesn't have a broken screen maybe a defective one with a working screen buy it then you'll have to find a way to take it apart and swap it out if you're not comfortable with it take it to a technician it's not easy let me warn you there are lots of small parts and very fragile wires that can easily break off  Laptop Oscilloscope Redundant array of independent disks Floppy disk IPod Bluetooth Universal Serial Bus Desktop computer Mattress Surveillance Wi-Fi PowerBook Mouse (computing) Digital photography Computer Windows XP Hewlett-Packard Amstrad CPC Liquid crystal display Cheating in Counter-Strike Prostate cancer 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Hard disk PlayStation 3 Atari ST Violin Theory of conduct Personal computer Television Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Web traffic Rational Unified Process Apple Macintosh Software testing Best Buy PowerBook G4 Rail tracks IMac Lionel Corporation ELO rating system 3D projection Plame affair Windows 2000 Gross domestic product Randomness Commodore International Keyboard layout Microeconomics Light-emitting diode IBook History of Microsoft Windows Telephone tapping B-47 Stratojet Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind National Weather Service Windows Vista Apple IIGS Loudspeaker BlackBerry Handloading Gamut System/36 Halting problem RuneScape cheats DVD Computer security Kasparov versus The World Nine Inch Nails Call centre PlayStation 2 Second language acquisition Flash memory Spark plug Consensus decision-making View camera Collision detection Traffic light Computer hardware ThinkPad Management information system Atari 8-bit family PDP-11 Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Movie theater Electrophysiology GeForce 4 CPU cache AmigaOS Internet protocol suite Internet fraud Tire Gramophone record Ozone layer Pump It Up Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Escape from New York TRS-80 Corporate governance

what can i use to clean the screen on my laptop i have the dark screen with my hp thank you in advance for your answers cleaning your lcd screen the major computer outlet stores are now starting to carry lcd cleaners for flat panel monitors and notebooks that do not contain the chemicals found in some commercial glass cleaners these cleaners will definitely do the job nicely but you do have to purchase them if you do not wish to purchase these factory made cleaners then you can clean your lcd screen in the following manner what you can use water water with a tiny amount of soft liquid soap isopropyl alcohol hexane petroleum benzine commercial glass cleaners that do not contain ammonia what you should avoid acetone ammonia ethyl acid ethyl alcohol methyl chloride toluene commercial glass cleaners containing ammonia how you should do it you should clean your lcd screen display by applying the cleaner to a soft clean cloth then you should wipe the cloth across the display from left to right moving from the top of the display down to the bottom of the display if your display contains grease or some other contaminant then you should dampen your cloth with water instead of a commercial cleaner as the cleaner may smear the contaminants across the screen  Liquid crystal display Solvent Laptop Cathode ray tube Ethanol Alcohol Dry cleaning Organic peroxide Hydrogen peroxide Ammonia Methanol Sewage treatment Biodiesel Water (molecule) IMac Isopropyl alcohol Stereoscopy Natural gas Screensaver Television Acetic acid Soldering Textile manufacturing Vacuum cleaner Windows XP Plasma display Soap Refrigerator Acetone Sulfur IUPAC nomenclature Lionel Corporation Plastic Liquid crystal display television PowerBook Sodium hypochlorite Energy development Titanium Coal Ester Toluene Ketone Mattress Solar cell Marine aquarium Brewery E number Drill bit Fire extinguisher Digital photography Lithium Oscilloscope Mercury (element) Solar power Bong Glossary of firefighting equipment Computer display Japanese toilet Carburetor Benzene Volatile organic compound Hydrogen economy Petrochemical Coffee Acetone peroxide Manicure Water purification Movie projector Sodium hydroxide Commodore International IBM PC compatible TFT LCD Vinegar Chlorine Amyl nitrite Olive oil Discovery One Organic light-emitting diode Haloalkane Hard disk Detergent Disinfection Thermal power station Formic acid Tofu Urine Breathalyzer Pixel Amiga Diseases of the honeybee Motor oil Alkane Butanone Light-emitting diode Iron Sodium Silicon

what's the difference between buying memory seperately rather than in kits i'm in the market for gigs of memory for my soon to be laptop kits are hard to find and aren't usually in stock i'm buying crucial brand by the way i can get gb sticks for cheaper than gb sticks in a kit but i heard kits are better since they're more likely to work together better is there really a difference if i were to buy just gb sticks of the same kind rather than an overpriced kit of the same product or is there something special about purchasing paired memory in kits meh there is really no need to get memory in a kit especially if you are going crucial the main reason they have kits are so people get memory that will run well in dual channel mode but as long as you get two of the same model memory you are not going to have any issues  IBM PC compatible PlayStation 2 Sinclair Research Ltd Hard disk Bluetooth Laptop O scale Game controller Sound Blaster Xbox 360 Advanced Squad Leader Personal computer Apple Macintosh Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis ATI Technologies Mutual fund PowerPC Kit Kat Atari 8-bit family History of Microsoft Windows Radeon Sega Overclocking PDP-11 Computer GunZ The Duel IPod M16 (rifle) IBook Radio controlled airplane GeForce 4 MSX Ford Falcon Sony Digital photography Efficiency wages Sega Dreamcast CompactFlash Illegal drug trade Floppy disk USB flash drive Timpani Atari ST CPU cache Wayne Corporation Commodore International Homebuilt aircraft TurboGrafx 16 Xbox Oscilloscope Economics ZX Spectrum Amway Bulk vending Random access memory Microeconomics Sears Holdings Corporation Sony Computer Entertainment Windows XP Altair 8800 Advertising M4 Carbine Inkjet printer Translation memory Meccano Central processing unit Motorcycle C programming language Airsoft Mike Portnoy Stock PowerBook Microcontroller Microprocessor Pump It Up Citigroup Scale model Commodore 64 Macromedia Flash Matchbox (toy company) PlayStation 3 Steam (content delivery) InterCity Express Commodore PET Science fiction on television Windows 2000 SKS Pentium 4 Final Fantasy XI Nintendo Game Boy Advance SP Krag-J__rgensen Walkman Manchester United F.C.

lap top really slow please help i need this computer to work a lot faser so i have a tosiba sattelite lap top and recently like the past month or two it's started to get really slow everything takes a while to load i sometimes have to manualy turn it off and restart it also sometimes when i restart it it doesn't fully restart and it just sits there with the tosiba screen never makeing it to the windows loading screen i've used several virus spyware scanners and they've turned up nothing i've used ccleaner to try to help clean it up but that hasn't done much either i'd really like to try to fix this myself rather than takeing it somewhere so any help or tips would be greatly apriciated also it seems my free ram drops down really low i have a gb hard disk and meg ram thanks again in advance for any help it may be the applications that you install that slow it down as you install more programs and uninstall it wears out the computer and it gets slower i've tried many of those virus spyware scanners and ccleaner which never seem to work for me they might even play a role in slowing your computer down maybe you installed a program that slows it down you could always recover your computer i always do that when my computers seem to slow down or you could add more ram ram always speeds up a computer it could also be a program that you installed that would make a memory leak and uses a lot of memory have you installed any programs lately you could also defrag your computer to make yoru hard drive access files faster  Computer virus Windows XP Virtual memory Spyware IBM PC compatible Microsoft Windows Linux USB flash drive Blue screen of death Atari 8-bit family Apple Macintosh Random access memory Malware Indianapolis 500 RISC FreeDOS Commodore 64 Apple II family Hard disk Memory (computers) Rootkit IPod Commodore 128 Acorn Electron Page table Kazaa System/36 CPU cache Computer Mouse (computing) Windows Vista Apple IIGS Atari ST Personal computer Embedded system NeXT Screenshot RAM disk Internet Explorer PaX File system Read-only memory ZX Spectrum CPU design Macintosh Finder Windows 3.x IA-32 Knoppix Jet engine Anti-virus software Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Computer forensics Universal Serial Bus Fritz-chip Original Amiga chipset TRS-80 Color Computer Forth programming language Computer hardware Flash memory Computer security Amstrad CPC Btrieve Redundant array of independent disks System 7 (Macintosh) History of Microsoft Windows Laptop Toyota Prius Spring operating system Floppy disk Mac OS X Digital photography Nintendo GameCube Computer storage DOS Wind turbine Microprogram MS-DOS Mach kernel PlayStation 3 IMac NX bit Master Control Program Partition (computing) MIPS architecture TRS-80 Computer file SAM Coup__ NTFS Adware Data General Nova

laptop vs pc which is better i've been looking at computers lately and am unsure whether or not to buy a pc or a laptop i'll need it for school but other than that i'm not a big gamer although i want to be able to watch and burn movies and music and i do have an extensive picture library on my current computer what are some of the pros and cons of both would a laptop be better for a student or not really will a pc last longer than a laptop regarding durability it all depends on how you use it are you violent and impulsive and the duration of usage if its long and you abuse them like hitting the keyboards and stuff naturally they dont last very long and what you intend it to use for daily editting of photos studies etc or just lounging around with ur notebook pros of a desktop more versatile in terms of changing hardware can void the warranty or diy a computer yourself and change hardwares according to your needs capable of computing speeds unimaginable on notebooks yet cons of desktop not compact not travel friendly pros of notebook very light between kg only much more compact can use any where you like cons of notebook hardly able to upgrade anything besides ram and hard disks which are still rather expensive computing power are much more inferior compared to a decent desktop overheating issue may occur because of their slim design short battery life they usually say on the flyers etc that they last for up to hours but usually they dont even last half of that unless you set the cpu speed to the lowest and lowest brightness level of the lcd screen if its for school and u require a notebook frequently then by all means get a notebook consider a mac if ur gonna do video photo editting and since you aren't a big gamer the more you should get a notebook since they are also capable of watching dvds burning of data etc etc have fun choosing  IBM PC compatible Apple Macintosh PowerBook Windows XP Hard disk Computer IBook PlayStation Portable IMac Windows Vista Personal computer Desktop computer Mouse (computing) Floppy disk Digital photography History of Microsoft Windows Universal Serial Bus IPod PowerPC Atari 8-bit family Desknote Atari ST Television Radeon Handheld game console Computer and video games Computer hardware Redundant array of independent disks Linux 64-bit Amiga Computer virus Windows 2000 PlayStation 2 Microprocessor ATI Technologies Pentium M Central processing unit MAME Liquid crystal display Musical Instrument Digital Interface PlayStation 3 QuickTime Wi-Fi CPU design DVD Apple II family TRS-80 Amstrad CPC Power Macintosh G3 System 7 (Macintosh) High-definition television Acorn Archimedes Xbox 360 Pentium 4 Commodore 128 Blu-ray Disc Game Boy Advance Computer bus Sega Dreamcast Sun Microsystems History of computer and video games Sharp Zaurus Bicycle lighting AmigaOS Microsoft Windows CPU cache Screenshot Knoppix X Window System Mac mini Apple IIGS USB flash drive National Weather Service Overclocking Mach kernel Bluetooth Copy protection Sega Saturn Java programming language Embedded system Atari 2600 IBM PC Xbox Emulator Super Nintendo Entertainment System Wearable computer

blue screen comes up as i am trying to re install windows after i did system recovery help i've been having problems with my laptop the blue screen keeps coming up so i decided to do a system recovery my laptop has this system recovery and windows vista setup built into a separate partition it's restored my c drive but as it's going through the vista setup the blue screen comes up again please help me thank you hi julie the blue screen or blue screen of death is normally a sign of a hardware problem or failure and theres not much can go wrong on a laptop however one of the main problems with laptops is the vents which keep the laptops cpu and mainboard cool this is a small vent on the side and rear of the laptop and you can hear it when the laptop is running however after time the vents become blocked with dust and muck and if it gets too bad and the c p u and mainboard start to overheat then you will start to experience blue screen errors and crashes the blue screens are normally saftey features built into vista to stop any further damage to your processor and other internal components i recommend you clean these vents out with a air duster one of these http direct tesco com q r aspx and blast out the dirt and muck from the area of the vents this is totally safe to do as the air duster only blasts with compressed air so no solvents are used after you have done this leave for about minutes and then boot back up upon boot press the f key to enter set up and then you will enter bios find the option to set to bios defaults or set failsafe defaults this will set your laptop to settings that will work every time these wont be allways the best settings but at least they will work after you have done this remember to press save and exit set up to save your changes to cmos during the save to cmos do not switch off your laptop this could damage your p c s bios and in the case of a laptop this could mean certain doom once all this has been done you can re try installing the windows vista recovery as windows vista set up is quite a technical installation the stress put on your processor during installation can make your processor get too hot and this is whats making your laptop crash andd display the blue screen if this continues to occur then you need to take the laptop to a experienced p c technician not p c world for some further diagnostics any more advice or problems let me know good luck julie  Windows XP Blue screen of death Hard disk IBM PC compatible Windows Vista Windows 2000 Laptop Apple Macintosh History of Microsoft Windows Microsoft Windows Booting Mouse (computing) Redundant array of independent disks Oscilloscope BIOS Knoppix Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Floppy disk IPod Microprocessor Embedded system PowerBook AmigaOS TRS-80 DragonFly BSD NTFS Capacitor plague PC Engine Virtual memory NX bit Power-On Self Test CPU design Personal computer M16 (rifle) Spyware Linux Sega Dreamcast Space disaster System/34 Television Apple Intel transition Commodore 64 Atari 8-bit family CPU cache Mercury Atlas 6 System/36 Emacs Super Nintendo Entertainment System Computer forensics Black screen of death PaX Modchip Computer virus Mac OS X Motorola 68000 Jet engine Mac OS X v10.4 Universal Serial Bus ZX Spectrum Galileo spacecraft Partition (computing) Windows Server 2003 PlayStation Portable Central processing unit Windows Me IMac Overclocking Bluetooth Dodge Charger Mozilla Firefox MDAC Sinclair ZX81 Apple II family Upper Memory Area Thermostat Screenshot OpenGL Sega Saturn PowerBook G4 Amstrad CPC Supercomputer Desktop computer Windows registry Thermal power station RISC Wintel Unicode Acorn Computers

my computer labtop has shortcircuted what do i do i accidentally spilt a half a glass of milk on my keyboard and in seconds my labtop shortcircuted what should i do is my labtop gone forever i tried to reboot it after drying the keyboards surface but then it just shuts down after like seconds i'm so sorry to me spills are the most heart breaking of computer accidents the good news is that while the computer may not run chances are all of your files and programs are probably still safely stored on your hard drive you can always transfer that drive to a new computer first and foremost don't try to turn your computer on again until a you've checked your warranty and coverage plans b you have cleaned as much of the milk residue as you can away both on and inside the computer c you're certain the computer is completely dry and clean if you paid for a laptop protection plan check that for spill coverage there are some plans that offer replacement for accidental damage of this sort if you don't have spill coverage but you're still under warranty then your laptop manufacturer may do the cleaning and repairing for you for a fee chances are they'll take your hard drive out of your laptop and put it in a refurbished machine and give that to you in that case you may be without your laptop for several weeks if your computer is past warranty and isn't covered for spill damage then it's up to you to break out the screwdriver open it up clean it up and resuscitate it as best as you can milk is a particularly nasty substance to have on a computer because it contains natural sugars that can soften and become corrosive when the computer heats up and that could cause further electrical shorts to occur plus if you don't get that all cleaned up it's going to spoil smelly nasty therefore you need to clean every last bit of milk off of the metal connections on your motherboard when cleaning the computer don't use any soaps or other cleaning solvents only use water or the tiniest touch of rubbing alcohol and a clean cloth that doesn't leave any flakes or residue behind and make sure you allow the computer several hours to dry before trying to power it on again if you power the laptop up and anything seems wrong or it starts beeping pull the battery immediately to cut the power i don't want to get your hopes up too high but there is a chance that your poor computer will survive its dairy dip it depends where the milk spilled how much of the milk came in contact with connections on the mother board and how well you clean it up before you let any more electricity and heat near it if the milk landed right on your laptop keyboard then the keyboard might have collected most of the milk and guided it out to the edges of the computer preventing it from leaking into too many places on the heart of your motherboard replacing a laptop keyboard is certainly easier and more affordable than replacing the whole thing best of luck and happy cleaning gl  Dairy Laptop Universal Serial Bus Soldering Hard disk Floppy disk Fecal incontinence Printed circuit board Drill bit Incandescent light bulb Thermal power station Apple Computer IBM PC compatible Screw Mars Exploration Rover Computer forensics IPod Battery electric vehicle IBM PC Breastfeeding Redundant array of independent disks Milk Tire Coffee Toyota Prius Haloalkane Social rule Personal computer Solar power Sulfuric acid Energy development Welding Dry cleaning Textile manufacturing Tooth Oscilloscope Corrosion Upholstery Seismic retrofit Windows XP Chernobyl accident Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Computer virus Internal ballistics Spark plug Equine conformation Friction Wind turbine Plastic Sento Vacuum tube Carburetor IBook Mattress Hybrid vehicle Naval mine Atari ST Condom Violin Gas metal arc welding Fossil fuel power plant Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Menstrual cup Amiga Tattoo Poker jargon Alcohol fuel Fire fighting Stroke Motor oil Transistor Bicycle lighting USB flash drive Capacitor plague Overclocking Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Windows 2000 Hemp Pebble bed reactor Carbon dioxide Heinkel He 100 Trademark Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Paint Circuit design Warranty Surveillance

my laptop is running really slowly and i only just formatted it help i have formatted my laptop many times before but now my computer is just so slow its slow in the way that it played youtube videos perfectly didnt ever need to wait to load now when videos load it stops and starts about every second when i drag a window it is nowhere near smooth its very choppy please help i've installed all the drivers that came on the driver recovery cd these drivers have worked fine in the part on previous re installs i suspect that after you reformatted your computer you forgot to install the latest graphics drivers for your computer do you know what graphics card you have if you have a laptop or a low end pc with a graphics card built right into the mother board then typically the drivers are provided on the website of whomever manufactures your computer so if you have a dell laptop go to dell's website go to their support page specify your model and operating system and then download and install the latest graphics drivers if you have a desktop with a separate graphics card that you had installed onto your mother board then you'll need to get the latest drivers from the graphics card provider which will typically be either nvidia www nvidia com then select download drivers from the front page or ati www ati com then select drivers and software from the front page i hope that works for you gl  ATI Technologies Radeon IBM PC compatible Windows Vista OpenGL Windows XP Apple Macintosh Linux Mac OS X History of Microsoft Windows GeForce 6 Series Graphics card IPod Windows 2000 AmigaOS USB flash drive 3dfx Graphics processing unit GeForce 4 DirectX Microsoft Windows Laptop Teletext Object Desktop PlayStation 2 Hard disk Universal Serial Bus Blue screen of death Floppy disk Windows 3.x X Window System Vertex and pixel shaders H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Apple IIGS OS/2 Atari ST Musical Instrument Digital Interface Bluetooth OpenBSD Nintendo Revolution GeForce 2 Knoppix Mouse (computing) QuickDraw 3D SUSE Linux MDAC Portable Document Format Common Unix Printing System PostScript Computer software PCI Express Video Graphics Array Counter-Strike Commodore 64 Windows Server 2003 Windows Me Computer virus GeForce FX BIOS Apple Computer Spyware Digital audio player Wi-Fi PlayStation 3 Macromedia Flash TRS-80 Color Computer Opera (web browser) TRS-80 Game programming DOS Apple II family Silicon Graphics Library (computer science) History of operating systems Sun Microsystems Autodesk Media and Entertainment Radeon X Series Shader Commodore International Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Windows Mobile ITunes System 7 (Macintosh) LiveCD Microprocessor Timeline of computing 1990-forward Screenshot 3D computer graphics

budget and looking for a place to get a good gaming laptop well i have about thousand dollars and i'm looking for a laptop that is capable of playing most modern games i don't know a whole lot about laptops because i normally focus on desktops so i'm not sure what kind of laptops are out and about these days i'm looking for one that can play games without to much of a problem the game i'm really looking forward into playing on the laptop is city of heroes so if anyone can tell me of a good laptop i can get around then that would be awesome thanks city of heros is no longer high up there in demand so most newer laptops should play it but you will need to double check that your laptops video chipset is compatibal even if the video device in the laptop is strong enough it might not be fully supported besides that you normally need to pay two times the amount on a laptop so a laptop is only about as good as a maybe desktop which should be enough for that game anyhow if you really want a gaming system you will want to get a desktop for example very good gaming desktops cost around and if you want a laptop thats about the same your looking at but should get you a laptop that can play city of heros but future games will probably be out of the question because laptops have about half the life as a desktop because of the limited upgrade ability ekee a alienware laptop would be terrible about months ago the cheapest desktop i saw on there site was over and the cheapest laptop was like there very best laptops were around and were only as good as desktops maybe things have changed a lot lately but alien ware stuff is the most expensive you can get unless you look really hard plus most good in store laptops are over so i cannot believe an alien ware laptop being any ware near  Laptop Personal computer Windows XP Computer Radeon Floppy disk PowerBook Apple Macintosh Universal Serial Bus Atari ST Mac OS X Windows Vista Wi-Fi ATI Technologies Linux History of Microsoft Windows Desktop computer Steam (content delivery) Computer bus Apple Intel transition Blu-ray Disc Advance fee fraud Atari 2600 IPod AmigaOS Video game music Video on demand Microprocessor Bluetooth Flash memory OpenGL Supercomputer Windows 2000 Redundant array of independent disks Sun Microsystems IBook Musical Instrument Digital Interface Slot machine Pentium 4 Desknote USB flash drive GSM services Inflation Internet Surveillance Oscilloscope Object Desktop Hydrogen economy Pocket PC Commodore 64 Television StarCraft Atari 8-bit family NeXT The Sims Hewlett-Packard INMOS Transputer Game Boy Advance Poker jargon Computer and video game industry Star Trek Customizable Card Game Digital photography Nintendo Mach kernel Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Supply and demand Computer and video games Pretty Good Privacy Broadband Internet access PC Engine 64-bit Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Apple IIGS Amiga CPU cache Overclocking Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Microeconomics Nintendo 64 High-definition television Pump It Up Civilization IV Space Shuttle program PlayStation 3 Stardock Mandriva Linux Neopets Alienware Computer hardware Celeron Digital camera

laptob help ok i have a laptob toshiba satellite and i wanna know how do i install a better video card and wats a good cheap video card for games the really short answer is if the laptop has a modular video adapter rather than embedded video on the mainboard then it might be possible to upgrade the video adapter you will need to be specific about what model laptop you have and what company manufactured it even then it may be necessary to do more research to find out if your laptop is upgradeable satellite is a product line of laptops made by toshiba just as chevrolet is a product line of vehicles made by general motors some toshiba satellite laptops like the m s come preconfigured intel core duo t cpu gb ram gb hdd intel integrated video adapter probably chip on mainboard imho while others like the a st can be customized at time of order graphics options for this model are intel graphics media accelerator with mb mb dynamically allocated shared graphics memory nvidia geforce go with mb dedicated graphics memory i searched toshibadirect com for video card upgrades and did not see any which suggests to me that even in those models that can be ordered with different graphics options the choice corresponds to a particular mainboard different embedded graphics adapters on different mainboards as appropriate not a different graphics card still you'll need to provide the exact model number for an accurate search to be done in response to your question good luck  GeForce 6 Series Graphics card IBM PC compatible Laptop Radeon PlayStation 3 GeForce 4 NVIDIA Apple Macintosh Windows Vista Windows XP 3dfx Bluetooth IMac Mac OS X PowerPC CPU design History of Microsoft Windows PlayStation 2 PC Engine PowerBook Personal computer Computer GeForce 2 Atari ST Xbox Graphics processing unit AMD PC motherboard Xbox 360 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis MIPS architecture IBM PC Amstrad CPC Celeron Secure Digital card Motherboard Cyrix Athlon Microprocessor PlayStation Portable GeForce FX Flash memory Central processing unit Intel Pentium 4 ZX Spectrum IBook VIA Technologies Silicon Graphics Hard disk Computer bus Desktop computer Cell (microprocessor) DDR2 SDRAM Nintendo Revolution Microsoft Windows Acorn Computers History of computing hardware (1960s-present) TRS-80 OpenGL Commodore International CPU cache Mac OS X v10.4 Modchip GeForce Timeline of computing 1990-forward GeForce 3 Amiga Sinclair ZX81 Atari 8-bit family Teletext ThinkPad Super Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo GameCube Nintendo 64 Commodore 64 Hewlett-Packard TurboGrafx 16 IBM GeForce 7 Series Apple IIGS Sound Blaster AMD K6-2 Counter-Strike PCI Express Mouse (computing) Radeon X Series Coprocessor IPod MOS Technology Nintendo 64-bit

why doesnt my macbook pro play dvds it says wrong region settings idk what that is but it just says it cant play it if you haven't set your macbook pro for the correct region it won't play any dvds this is from teh mac website many dvds use a region code a number that corresponds to a geographic area in order to play a dvd from australia for example the code on the dvd has to match the code on the device playing the dvd the first time you play a dvd with a region code your dvd drive is set to match that code this restricts dvd player to playing only discs with the same region code or with no region code generally the region code of your dvd drive matches the region code of the dvds available in the region where you live important you can change the region code of your dvd drive only five times this includes the original setting the fifth setting of the region code is permanent when you insert a disc with a different region code a dialog allows you to choose a new region code setting for your dvd drive don't change the region code of your dvd drive unless you expect to play only dvds that match the new region code in the future  DVD Regional lockout Modchip High-definition television Knoppix ZIP Code H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Copy protection AmigaOS Telephone numbering plan Blu-ray Disc Disk image DVD region code CD-ROM UK telephone numbering plan DVD Copy Control Association Slot machine MAME QuickTime Hamming code Online DVD rental Postcode Video codec Internet Group Management Protocol MAC address ITunes John McEnroe North American Numbering Plan Fischer Random Chess Laserdisc Laws of cricket Expert system Easter egg (virtual) Error correction and detection Rugby league Football (soccer) Floppy disk Mach kernel Anamorphic widescreen PlayStation 2 CPU cache International cricket in 2005 C plus plus Test cricket Redundant array of independent disks MP3 Back to the Future trilogy Golf Yu-Gi-Oh!

what is wrong with my laptop battery ac input loose i have a compaq presario v it is about years old my ac adapter stoped working or so i thought because it was a generic one and i had to wiggle it around for it to work i bought a new generic one the last one worked fine i only had the original for months until my cat ate it i plugged it in the light went on and i thought i was good i look at it min later and the light isnt on and i can't get it to come back on when i press the start button the charging light will flicker about times and then nothing i took out the battery to see if it would turn on just plugged in and no battery nope i didnt even get a light i am not sure what is wrong with it and i really dont want to throw down a lot of money to figure it out what do you think it is the battery charger i haven't used it in like a month or because it hasn't worked just got the charger and it didnt work maybe i got a faulty charger on ebay ok so you had to wiggle it in the jack to get it to work most likely the ac plug is shattered inside the laptop this is a very common issue with laptops ideally the plug should fit into the jack securely and not have any wiggle room the only way to fix it is to bring it to a repair shop and have them solder a new ac plug to the motherboard this is not a guaranteed fix and the problem will eventually resurface the ac plug is very fragile all it takes is one bump to break it that is most likely what happened expect to spend upwards of us to get it repaired  Laptop Universal Serial Bus IBM PC compatible Toyota Prius Game Boy Advance SP Poker jargon Battery (electricity) Windows XP PowerBook Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Oscilloscope Capacitor plague Strap-on dildo Second Battle of the Atlantic Personal computer Pittsburgh Steelers IBM PC Canon T90 Tire Jack plug Mouse (computing) Ford Ranger EV Debugging John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Telephone exchange Hubble Space Telescope MOS Technology San Diego Chargers Cyrix Enigma machine Atari 8-bit family Bob and George Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Battery electric vehicle Roomba Piccolo Junior Saga Cruising (maritime) Characters of Lost Computer bus Electric boat Dodge Charger Atari ST Embedded system Knife The Shining (film) ATI Technologies Welding Switch Lithium ion battery USS Vestal (AR-4) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sin City Shaggy dog story New York Giants Apple Newton Microeconomics Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Year 2000 problem Wheel of Fortune Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory GED Short selling Characters in the Smurfs Pump It Up IBook Game Boy EastEnders 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines PlayStation Portable Solar power Reading spark plugs for racing Bicycle lighting Xbox Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Nickel metal hydride Sumo Mercury Atlas 6 Light-emitting diode AmigaOS Cincinnati Bengals Carburetor Bond Advanced Technology Attachment Nickel-cadmium battery Enron Corporation Hiberno-English GunZ The Duel USS S-35 (SS-140) Bad Wolf Neon Genesis Evangelion glossary AMD Wi-Fi USB flash drive Professional wrestling throws Semiconductor device The Smoking Room Hearing aid

toshiba laptop keyboard i had to reformat my toshiba satellite laptop and ever since i have had a jumpy mouse or keyboard it's seems as if the keyboard became super sensitive because as i type an email or letter the keyboard commands sort of take over for instance as i type a long paragraph the curser will jump to the middle of the paragraph or it will highlight automatically and as i type it deletes i am not sure if it is the mouse pad or the keyboard does anyone know what causes this or if there is something i can download to fix this i don't look at the screen as i type so i never notice where the curser jumps thanks there might be keyboard and touchpad drivers for your laptop go to toshiba's website and look for the appropriate drivers and download them  Laptop Mouse (computing) Touchpad WordStar Bluetooth ThinkPad Desktop computer Keyboard layout Universal Serial Bus Opera (web browser) Computer keyboard IPod Hard disk Logo programming language IBM PC compatible Tablet PC Game controller Apple Desktop Bus Vim (text editor) Option key Windows 2000 Cascading Style Sheets Emacs Computer and video game genres AmigaOS Toshiba Greeklish Battlefield 2 Windows XP WordPerfect IBM PC keyboard Microsoft Windows Cheating in Counter-Strike Closed-circuit television Brainfuck Digital photography Screensaver Function key Esperanto orthography Computer Gmail Computer virus User interface MDAC Apple Newton System/36 Apple Macintosh Blue screen of death Desknote Dvorak Simplified Keyboard IMac E-mail Mozilla Application Suite Danger Hiptop Advance fee fraud Malware Mac OS X v10.4 DVD Personal computer Portable Document Format Cangjie method TiVo Intellivision Diacritic Atari ST American Beauty (album) Windows Vista Patent Apostrophe (mark) Device driver Musical Instrument Digital Interface Color Halo 2 TeX Flash memory GunBound Pure Pwnage 24 (television) IBM EIA-708 Pump It Up Mozilla Firefox Surveillance Minesweeper (computer game) Japanese copyright law Macintosh Portable PowerBook Stopping e-mail abuse Internet fraud Creative Zen IBM PC StepMania Wi-Fi Forth programming language Screenshot Commodore BASIC Macro Gorillaz Copyright

secure does this mean another person can log into my network i set up my wireless network the other day and secured it today i noticed two odd things i notice when i connect to it the key is already there and all i have to do is click connect its in bullets but the key is already there i don't have to put it in the second thing i noticed is just to see just how secure it is i decided to put in a different figure for the key to see if it will connect and it did does this mean that my neighbor can pick up my network and put just anything in the key box and connect to it although i secured it how do i fix this i thought it was secure did you punch in a key your self its usually a wep key digit or digit depending on which you used you can use the digit and of the time they are not going to get in but if you tried on your computer your computer may have bumped the changed key and auto connected using the other key it will go down your wireless list until it finds a connection but that will only work on a computer that already has the key to begin with if someone does not have the key they can not log on to your wireless network try connecting to your network with another computer that does not have the key and try different keys to log on it will not log on i have a laptop and if i move the main connection to the bottom i can try to connect to my connection with a different key it will try then it will move down the list of known connections til it connects if it can you can also look to see if your using windows to manage your wireless it will say secured or padlock type note if it says that your are pretty much safe from the average computer user thanks  Wi-Fi Wardriving Public-key cryptography Windows XP Bluetooth Wireless LAN Password 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Modem Wired Equivalent Privacy Windows 2000 Pretty Good Privacy Wi-Fi Protected Access USB flash drive PlayStation Portable Freenet BlackBerry Computer Wireless access point Global Positioning System Universal Serial Bus IBM PC compatible IEEE 802.11i AirPort Computer security Internet Telegraphy Internet Relay Chat Telephone Cable television Closed-circuit television Palm OS Computer virus GSM services Lock picking Rootkit Common Unix Printing System Apple Macintosh E-mail Mac OS X Transmission Control Protocol Wireless mesh network MDAC Phase-shift keying Database Vertical service code Cellular network Secure Shell Hash table Floppy disk Cryptanalysis Surveillance Computer keyboard Spyware Computer forensics Password cracking Embedded system History of Microsoft Windows Malware Google Talk Geographic information system Cisco Systems Domain Name System File system System/34 Television Xbox File sharing Laptop Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Security token IPod Network Switching Subsystem IEEE 802.11 Wireless network Nortel Networks Cryptography Mobile phone Extensible Authentication Protocol Gmail Enterprise content management Cryptographic hash function Passphrase HTTP cookie Acorn Computers Nintendo GameCube Control-Alt-Delete Windows Vista Personal computer Steam (content delivery) Musical Instrument Digital Interface Apple Open Collaboration Environment Btrieve Java programming language Friend-to-friend Skype RC4 NSA encryption systems

windows vista what's the difference what's the difference between windows vista and regular windows the official microsoft site will depict how vista excels in giving the users more security choice and benefits with their updated software thats the official line but however the users in their experience using vista have a different story to tell i have used vista on my laptop the visuals are spectacular in networking is almost automated you have to get used to where things are now stored in folders also i found that if the network settings are altered due to my installing other programs and cleaning the system sometimes these network settings are difficult to fix esp wireless when i can no longer find available networks and you can't simply configure network wizard again like you do with xp i could resort back by using system restore points in terms of hardware vista requires a powerful system to run effectively and lots of ram so it can process commands anything less and the experience is horrible it needs gb system ram and at least a ghz dual core chip to be worth looking at seriously  Windows XP Windows Vista Mac OS X History of Microsoft Windows Apple Macintosh System 7 (Macintosh) Wi-Fi Xbox 360 Computer virus Bluetooth Linux AmigaOS Microsoft OpenGL Modem MDAC 64-bit File system Server Computer CPU cache Central processing unit OS/2 Windows registry Object Desktop Virtual memory BIOS Operating system Mac OS X v10.4 Portable Document Format Common Unix Printing System Fritz-chip X Window System Windows API Pentium 4 Spyware Database management system Emacs Embedded system History of the graphical user interface Global Positioning System Knoppix Library (computer science) NX bit Pocket PC Control Panel (Windows) Expert system Redundant array of independent disks Mozilla Firefox PlayStation 2 Sun Microsystems Windows 3.x Outlook Express CPU design ITunes Random access memory MIPS architecture Booting Rootkit Xbox Backup Computer forensics MAME Computer security PlayStation Portable Mach kernel Buffer overflow Perl Password ATI Technologies Information Technology Infrastructure Library Apple II family Wireless LAN Enterprise content management RISC Pretty Good Privacy Wardriving Cheating in Counter-Strike Kernel (computer science) Macintosh Finder Stopping e-mail abuse PHP Laptop

do laptop cooling pads really work i am thinking about buying a cooling pad for my laptop can anybody tell me if they are effective in doing what they are supposed to do and is there any difference between the usb type and the ac dc type any moving air current will transfer some heat from the laptop which is always a good thing key point is where is the hot spot on the pc i have running at the moment and on checking the toshiba's base is completely cool as heat is being vented out of the side left hand keys on the other hand no pun are warm to the touch using a cooling pad would not therefore make a great deal of difference the dell however is noticeably warm underneath indicating that a lot of heat transfer is taking place between the components and the case a cooling pad here would help reduce internal temperatures by speeding up the heat transfer on the question of usb v mains as others have pointed out usb will allow you to cool on the move but will reduce battery life whilst a c will be more efficient and extend the battery however it follows that if you are able to plug in your cooling pad you can also plug in your laptop so any situation in which you could use a mains unit would also allow you to use a usb unit without using the battery at all i would therefore go with the usb version to give you more usability  Laptop Motor oil IBM PC compatible Heat Solar power Thermostat Lithium ion battery Hard disk Internal combustion engine Computer cooling Bluetooth Thermal power station USB flash drive Engine cooling Floppy disk Stirling engine Energy Mouse (computing) Spacecraft propulsion Battery electric vehicle Nuclear reactor Air conditioning Ocean thermal energy conversion IPod Overclocking Secure Digital card DVD Tank Carburetor Computer bus Toyota Prius Fire fighting Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Jet engine Tire Terraforming Battery (electricity) Soldering Wind Windows XP Energy development Lighting Transistor Apple Macintosh Renewable energy Autonomous building Vacuum tube Welding PlayStation Portable Diode Ford Ranger EV Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Casting Computer forensics Desktop computer IBook Peltier-Seebeck effect Explosive material Creative Zen Sun Two-stroke cycle Closed-circuit television Global warming FireWire Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Gas metal arc welding Flash memory Diesel engine Turbocharger Plutonium Swamp cooler HVAC Convection Digital photography Water (molecule) Central processing unit One-time pad Transformer Digital audio player Hyperthermia Heat pump Urban heat island Upholstery Incandescent light bulb Cheating in Counter-Strike Nuclear power Windows 2000 Xbox 360 National Weather Service Heat exchanger Strap-on dildo Scramjet

wireless keyboard conflicts with built in keyboard help i just purchased a wireless keyboard for my laptop and now it conflicts with my built in keyboard help i'm running xp and want to switch between the two different keyboards instead of having it recognise just the wireless one there was nothing wrong with the wireless mouse but the keyboard definitely conflicted it's strange because using usb port external keyboards were not a problem it's just the wireless keyboard that conflicted i don't have a wireless keyboard so i can't exactly give you personal experience suggestions but i do have a few wireless mice since the mice i have are usb devices they need specific drivers to function i installed the provided software to operate them logitech provided the drivers on my laptop i am able to use the wireless mouse and the track pad at the same time also i can remove the wireless mouse by turning it off or disabling it and continue to use the track pad i strongly believe that both keyboards cannot be used simultaneously because of a shared resource restriction if you want to switch from wireless to non wireless then you should disable or turn off power to the wireless device to see if you can switch  Universal Serial Bus Mouse (computing) Bluetooth IMac USB flash drive Windows XP Apple Macintosh Wi-Fi Windows 2000 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Laptop IBook Personal computer Desktop computer Nintendo Revolution Microsoft Windows X Window System IBM PC compatible Computer IPod Device driver Floppy disk Apple Computer Xbox AmigaOS Computer keyboard Atari ST BlackBerry History of Microsoft Windows Computer and video games Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Secure Digital card Mac mini Verizon Wireless Architecture of Windows 2000 Cheating in Counter-Strike Amstrad CPC Modem Computer surveillance X10 (industry standard) Wireless LAN WordPerfect Game controller Danger Hiptop Booting PowerBook Speech recognition PowerPC IBM PC PlayStation 2 Hard disk Super Nintendo Entertainment System OpenBSD Linux Tablet PC Wireless Application Protocol Digital photography Object Desktop USB mass storage device class Tungsten Handheld Ethernet PlayStation Portable IPAQ Atari 8-bit family Surveillance Computer bus PlayStation 3 Modchip Wireless Sharp Zaurus Nintendo DS Windows Vista ZX Spectrum WiMAX FireWire Closed-circuit television Computer hardware OpenGL Control-Alt-Delete Xbox 360 Mobile phone VMware Cellular network Telephone PCI Express Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Opera (web browser) Palm OS AlphaSmart Flash memory TGV Hearing impairment Internet Computer accessibility PIC microcontroller

what is the best laptop for a college student i only want to use it for school related and i will travel alot with it i'd suggest a macbook it's easy to use fairly light in weight compared to other laptops and you get free technical support at any apple store around the world if you like pcs over macs i'd suggest a dell their customer supporter and repairs are very prompt and they do what they can to make sure they don't keep your computer for too long which is great when you're a student and need your computer at all times  IBM PC compatible Laptop Mac OS X Windows XP Apple II family Floppy disk Apple Intel transition Commodore 64 Hard disk IBook IPod Computer PowerBook ATI Technologies Atari ST Wi-Fi EMachines Bluetooth Mac OS X v10.4 Computer workstation ITunes Music Store Universal Serial Bus System 7 (Macintosh) USB flash drive Microprocessor Hewlett-Packard Supercomputer Personal computer Blu-ray Disc Digital rights management PowerBook G4 Mouse (computing) Commodore International X Window System Pocket PC History of Microsoft Windows PowerPC BASIC programming language Digital audio player Sun Microsystems Mac OS ITunes Acadia University Linux Online music store Bridgewater State College Unicode Apple Computer IBM PC Apple Macintosh History of the graphical user interface Keyboard layout Timeline of computing 1990-forward Computer forensics Best Buy Mach kernel Personal digital assistant IMac NeXT Typeface Wintel WebObjects Screenshot 64-bit Secure Digital card WordPerfect BeOS Atari 8-bit family QuickTime Embedded system GIF Surveillance Mac OS 8 Apple typography Mozilla Firefox PDP-11 Microsoft Windows RISC Mac OS X v10.0 Lithium ion battery Seton Hall University Desktop computer Desknote Apple Lisa PNG QuickDraw 3D Windows Vista Amiga Video codec Notebook Macintosh Performa Apple Developer Connection Apple IIGS Seneca College Dell, Inc.

my laptop is difficult to type on what do i do hi i will type this question without any editing so you can se what the laptop does as i type on my laptop sometimes it doesnseem to register the keys that i push i don't know if there is an option to perhaps adjust the sensitivity setting of my keyboard or what buti sem to have to edit all of my sentences and fil in the keys that it didn't seem to register wen i yped it as you can see from what i typed above i'm editing my typing now there are missing letters that i did type they just didn't seem to register for some reason might anyone have a suggestion unfortunately the design of some notebooks allows your hand to graze over the touchpad for the mouse causing it to pick up the mouse movement and sometimes sacrifice the key stroke the other possibility is that either something is under the keys causing them to not to make the proper contact when pressed get a can of compressed air wal mart sells these in the computer section and blow it in short bursts along each row of keys finally there could be something corrupted in the keyboard driver this part assumes you are using windows xp click on start and then right click on my computer select properties then select the hardware tab and select device manager once in device manager click on the next to keyboards likely there will be only one option but if there is more than one select the one for you keyboard and right click on it click on uninstall then reboot your computer as the computer restarts it will recognize the keyboard and reinstall the driver but hopefully this time it won't be corrupted  Mouse (computing) Laptop Windows 2000 Windows XP IBM PC compatible Universal Serial Bus Blue screen of death Computer keyboard Dvorak Simplified Keyboard Unicode Enigma machine Atari 8-bit family IPod Booting Microsoft Windows Floppy disk Hard disk Screenshot IMac Control-Alt-Delete Touchpad CPU cache Atari ST Bluetooth Windows Vista Apple typography X Window System Computer Amstrad CPC Password Object Desktop Game controller Typewriter Musical Instrument Digital Interface TRS-80 Color Computer Virtual memory Device driver Personal computer History of Microsoft Windows TRS-80 Microsoft Control Panel (Windows) Gmail BIOS Jumpstart 3rd Grade Sinclair ZX81 International Phonetic Alphabet Desktop computer Computer and video games Game programmer Minesweeper (computer game) Public-key cryptography Manual transmission Microprocessor Function key Computer and video game genres HTTP cookie Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Architecture of Windows 2000 IBM PC keyboard Control character Carpal tunnel syndrome Bass guitar 64-bit IBM PC Debugging Vim (text editor) Xerox Star Domestic AC power plugs and sockets System/36 Option key Fitts' law Common Unix Printing System Embedded system Stenotype Copy protection Amiga OS/2 MIPS architecture Apple Computer Stardock Kernel (computer science) WordStar CPU design

itunes help how do i get my songs from my pc to my laptop my laptop is authorized it is on my network i can listen to the songs on the network at home but i can't get them to stay on the laptop when it is away from home network i'm taking the laptop on a trip i can't figure out how to get my itunes purchased songs onto my laptop ideas thanks if you import the song using itunes it doesn't actually copy the file it just creates a pointer to where it's located on the network itunes sees a network drive the same as local drive you should copy the songs to thumb drive and then copy them onto the laptop copy the itunes folder w subfolders for each artist from my music then drop the whole thing into my music on the laptop the pain is that you then need to go into each song on the laptop itunes and tell it how to find the songs the alternative is to delete the entire library on the laptop then copy the music files into the laptop then import the new itunes folder you have to think like a computer for this to make sense  ITunes ITunes Music Store ILife IPod Online music store FairPlay Macintosh Finder Bluetooth Windows XP File system IBM PC compatible Mouse (computing) File sharing Digital audio player Apple Macintosh Windows 2000 Windows Vista Computer virus Digital rights management SonicStage QuickTime Universal Serial Bus Computer Laptop NTFS File Allocation Table We Belong Together Library (computer science) .NET assemblies History of the graphical user interface TLC System/36 Master Control Program Mac OS X Alanis Morissette System 7 (Macintosh) Video game music RealNetworks Podcasting Apple Computer Mac OS X v10.4 MP3 CPU cache Mixtape Disc jockey Copyleft Desktop computer Directory History of Microsoft Windows Hard disk Jimmy Eat World USB flash drive The Emancipation of Mimi IPod shuffle Computer forensics Jon Lech Johansen Partition (computing) Web page Tori Amos Linux PowerBook Mach kernel Rhapsody (online music service) Sun Microsystems Screenshot Backup Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Multitrack recording Btrieve Uploading and downloading Redundant array of independent disks Walkman PNG GNOME C programming language BitTorrent Floppy disk Xerox Star Remix Mac OS history Warez Gmail Bastard pop Marching band Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Vorbis Disk image Billboard Hot 100 Java programming language Copy protection Michael Robertson Plaintext NTFS junction point Shake It Off Copyright infringement of software Surveillance Wi-Fi This Week in Tech File folder Pretty Good Privacy

apple and pc question what i have now is the basic pc i am thinking about getting an apple next laptop and heard that the new apples have windows programs is that true do you find it to work well will you be able to change it to the newest upgrades as needed computer newbie here please not very technical if possible thank you i have a dell and an apple and my girlfriend has an apple that uses the intel chip she has separated her laptop into a mac portion and a windows portion so it's very cool but if you're not very computer literate you probably don't want to do that here are the pros and cons pros of apple i believe they are faster and once you get used to how they work you will probably find them easier to use there are no viruses to screw them up unless you install windows on them there are lots of cool programs like dashboard and garage band that are not yet available for pcs cons of apples there are some programs that you will need pc technology to use for example some videos that your friends may send you by email especially wmv formats will require a program not readily available on apples there are also other programs and formats that do not have an exact conversion you will be able to open and read word on text edit programs on an apple but if you try to edit the document it will not appear the way you want back on a pc there may be better conversion programs in the future but they will also probably be costly some other commercial and free programs have an apple equivalent but they may not work as well for example skype or other programs there is also the issue of itunes the itunes program on an apple is different than on a pc and you need to format your ipod for one or the other you cannot go back and forth  Mac OS X Apple Macintosh IPod Apple Computer IBM PC compatible ITunes Apple II family ITunes Music Store QuickTime Microsoft Windows Mac OS X v10.4 Laptop Podcasting Digital rights management Apple Intel transition MP3 X Window System Unicode Windows Vista WordPerfect RISC Microprocessor 64-bit Personal computer Microsoft PowerPC Computer Mouse (computing) Pretty Good Privacy Floppy disk Computer virus Visual Basic History of Microsoft Windows Microsoft Office Linux USB flash drive Vorbis Skype ATI Technologies Bluetooth Timeline of computing 1990-forward Commodore 64 Portable Document Format AppleScript IBook High-definition television Atari 8-bit family TRS-80 Radeon HyperCard History of computing hardware (1960s-present) FireWire Operating system History of the graphical user interface Digital audio workstation Hard disk Macromedia Flash OpenGL OpenDocument Digital audio player AmigaOS OS/2 File format Amiga NeXT Universal Serial Bus Voice over IP E-mail Steve Jobs Spyware CPU cache PowerBook Linux kernel BASIC programming language Apple IIGS PostScript Online music store Apple typography CPU design Microsoft Word IBM PC Apple Newton Wintel Common Unix Printing System Computer workstation Trusted computing Common criticisms of Microsoft Mac OS CP/M Ajax (programming) Lisp programming language </TEXT>
