do you believe that state universities should put the local community people that pay taxes first for example the university of florida has many programs that require a gpa to get in and some only have say spots open but apply i do not like the gpa requirement i think if you live in the state of florida and in the county where the college is you should get first in as long as you have a gpa in addition i think that florida residents should get free tuition to any state college what do you think i thank that any resident of any state should get free tuition in their stste i think that the gpa requirement is fair because that ensures that anyone wanting into the program is willing to work hard enough to get there i also think that all students should get free tuition to their state universities that's what it's like here in new mexico any student that graduates from a state high school with at least a gpa gets years of free tuition provided that they maintain a through that time we're really lucky the state lottery pays for those students however a lot of them slack off and lose their scholarships very quickly which is unfortunate  Education in the United States Grade (education) Student loan Tuition Graduate school HOPE Scholarship Affirmative action College admissions Scholarship Education in the People's Republic of China Kwantlen University College Middle Tennessee State University University of Michigan University of Central Florida University of Florida California Polytechnic State University Medical school School choice Franklin W.

how could i bring recess back at my school the th th and th graders don't get recess i'm in th and i want to change my school before i leave apperently some kids threw rocks at an old lady like ten years ago but that was years ago i don't know anyone who would do that i might make a small film using my new techniques from my film school how many names would i need on a petition in new jersey do the signers have to be of legal age first you need to come up with some good reasons why recess is important for older students try going online and finding some research on the connection of taking breaks and better learning that follows a break and how exercise is beneficial lack of exercise and obesity in children and how play is beneficial for children social benefits etc i would also work cooperatively and collaborate with others try talking to some teachers counselors principals parents and find some adults who agree with your reasons when concerns come up such as throwing rocks ask the adults what they think can be done to limit this behavior or what sort of consequences could be put in place you could also bring up new ideas what if the older students were to organize games or help out with the younger students or what about service projects planting a garden or working outside to better the school during this down time i don't think storming in with a petition is really going to do anything but it is good to talk to students and take down names of students who would be willing to help make this work then when you talk to the adults you can bring up that x number of students are willing to help and want to see this happen good luck i'm so glad to see someone your age working proactively to make change in the world  Education Theory of conduct Aikido Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Experiential education Recess (TV series) Infantilism Motivation Homeschooling Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tai Chi Chuan Second language acquisition Pitaten Education in the United States Divorce Bully Age of consent Autism rights movement Education in Japan Criticism of libertarianism Child sexuality Androgen insensitivity syndrome Piccolo Junior Saga GED Education in the People's Republic of China About a Boy Teachers (film) Economics Charter school Boston Public Theodicy Adolescence Scholarship Current teachings of Prem Rawat Scientology beliefs and practices School choice Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Graduate school College Patent Martial art Quicksort Literacy Link (Legend of Zelda) The Fairly OddParents The Adventures of Pete & Pete Lawrence v.

how come white people send their kids to private or home schooling brag about it only to get a stupid kid white people brag on private school and home schooling like they are actually doing their kid a favor this just goes to show the ignorance that is socially bred among white culture to believe in hysteria and urban legand rather than cold hard facts people who graduate from private school can't hold a candle to a black or a white kid who went to public school and are usually better in diverse topics of conversation public schools outperform private schools in academics arts and sports every year only a few private schools do well most of which are in england and the american one's that do well pretend that they represent private schools in general when in general private schools and home schooled children are a flop and are far behind their college peers when they enroll when will white people see that their privately schooled children are always the butt of a joke when they go out in public open their mouths and america gets a taste of they learned in school what terry doesn't know is that of course certain magazines will cover a sole story where a few kids did good however if you talk to the college admissions board themselves they will tell you that the majority of home schooled kids unless they are super rich with three private teachers have horrible inadequate education and barely make it into college at the rate of those schooled outside the home and the ones that do sneak by have a hard time in college and can barely keep up you will always have potheads and rejects who don't want to listen to teachers those people will have all kinds of problems in their life most properly raised children don't act like that the school is not the problem they are i think the urban legends may be more prevalent in the public schools im not sure where you got your information but it is almost certainly wrong i know because i attended both public and private schools i went to a private boarding school fro high school but eschewed the ivy league for a public university against everyone's wishes i can tell you that my work in high school was more challenging than my college work there really is no comparison there is also much less of the ignorant racism in private schools my roomate in fact was black he did fine in school sports and socially there were students of all races there all intelligent and we all got along together more or less your opinion is almost entirely unfounded i am really wondering how you develpoed these theories furthermore i am not sure who has 'bragged' to you abotu their kids in private schools perhaps someone has offended you with their racism and you responded by passing it on im not sure homeschool obviously is not standardized can you imagine that it would vary greatly if your parents were authors or nobel prize winners you would have a prized education and certainly many advantages if they were rural ne'er do wells well you could imagine they wouldn't do as well the problem with home schooling from a legislative standpoint is that how do you differentiate do you license parents that wish to homeschool mandate standardized tests textbooks truth is that even the quality of a public education can vary widely depending on the home environment so if someone has bragged to you about their kids in homeschool and you believe them to be 'stupid' you may be entirely correct in your judgement there are certainly ignorant people around every corner and under choice rocks just dont make the logical error of generalizing your experience to all people white people etc the problem is then that you may be the one who appears to be stupid  Affirmative action Waldorf Education Education in Japan Intelligent design movement Charter school Cornell University SAT Culture of the United States Education Teach the Controversy Public domain Eugenics Ivy League Columbia University Education in Australia Race and intelligence No Child Left Behind Act Internet troll Education in Malaysia Education in England Social rule Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Criticism of libertarianism College Economics Oregon State University University of Houston Education in Portugal Danish Folkeskole Education Education in Taiwan School choice Graduate school Private school Theory of conduct Anti-intellectualism Equal Protection Clause Asperger syndrome Education in India Kasparov versus The World Brown v.

if you intern at a place the whole summer does that allow you to do other things that summer like maybe working at starbucks or something like that i'm thinking of interning at nih oh yeah definitely next year depends on how flexible nih is with their schedules are you thinking about doing it this summer or next year it's probably too late to do anything for this summer now but if you're planning this for next summer i can't imagine nih being anything but flexible because i'm sure they don't have any interns for then but anyway when you're scheduling you also don't want to do too few hours per day i'm currently interning for congress and i'm the only intern who works full time so i get perks like helping out on legislation and getting to go along to events while the others who come in for less than four hours a day get to scan business cards so given the two things above i'd say the best solution would be to intern full time for a couple of days a week then work at wherever you want for the other days i'd also make sure the days were continuous like if you were planning on three days a week do monday wednesday rather than monday wednesday and friday staffers are always less likely to give you good assignments if you can't be relied upon to finish them now if you were willing to take stuff home it'd be a totally different ballgame anyway just extend some feelers out to nih when you're talking to them and just ask upfront it never hurts say that you're completely committed to them and that they're the first priority but you were wondering if there was a way you could do something else while being able to make the maximum amount of impact for the office best of luck  Extreme Programming Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Holiday Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Open access The Ashlee Simpson Show Fasting Cliff Richard Liturgical year Hebrew calendar International Date Line Monday Night Football Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Ken Jennings Soap opera Social rule Gregorian calendar 1896 Summer Olympics The Daily Show Daylight saving time Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Wednesday Weight training Wal-Mart Good Friday August 2005 in Britain and Ireland International League Rosa Parks Easter Jon Secada Operation Market Garden Video game developer National Institutes of Health Fathers' rights Caribbean Carnival United States House of Representatives Calculating the day of the week Saturday Night Live Friday Call centre UK Singles Chart Monday Kurt Angle Ron and Fez Paul Is Dead Satchel Paige Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Plame affair Time Out of Mind Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Vietnam Veterans Against the War Days of the week She Loves You Robert L.

how to get better grades when i was younger like in middle school i loved it i liked learning and had staright a's now when i get to high school i'm getting lazy and my grades aren't as good anymore but high school is more important so how can i get my interest for learning back again start by developing better habits you will discover that earning good grades is habit forming students who make a's tend to keep making them but you have to first take the first step to get the habit started i would select one thing from this list and master it over a period of one month then select another to add to the first and continue until you've mastered all of the items from the list set aside a regular time to study at least minutes a day during school and study something even if you don't have a regular homework assignment to complete reading practicing your mathematics researching etc complete all of your homework assignments on time even if you make mistakes be sure you've at least attempted to do every part of every assignment analyze your work on completed and graded assignments and tests attend tutorials or hire a tutor to help you thoroughly understand what mistakes you are making if you are unable to figure out your mistakes by yourself be on time to every class every day and do not be absent except in cases of emergency if you are absent get your assignments before you return to class and begin working on them if you are absent and unable to get the assignments ahead of time give yourself hours after you return to get yourself caught up from your absence prepare for every test spend at least an hour before every test looking over the materials that will be covered on the test perhaps you can work with classmates to form a study group read over the materials practice your mathematics memorize information that you know is going to be on the test and above all else get a good night sleep and eat a good breakfast before each test you will discover that you'll enjoy learning and enjoy school much more when these habits are established so good luck  Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school Education in the United States Grade (education) Massachusetts Institute of Technology Education in Romania Education Education in Germany Japanese tea ceremony Narcolepsy SAT Test (student assessment) Education in Taiwan Education in Japan Python programming language Homeschooling Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Hunter College High School No Child Left Behind Act Second language acquisition Extreme Programming College Asperger syndrome One Tree Hill (TV series) Gifted Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Education in Australia Speed reading Boy Scouts of America Explosive material Education in Hong Kong Economics Education in South Korea High school Secondary education in Japan Ravi Shastri Martial art Password Stevens Institute of Technology Singlish Juris Doctor Scientific method Welding Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Lawyer Secondary education in France The Hidden Curriculum Theory of conduct Consensus decision-making Quicksort Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Software engineering Phoebe Halliwell Education in France Moe Berg STS-62 Ludwig Wittgenstein Shaggy dog story Education in Austria Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Philosophy of language Hikaru no Go Humphrey Bogart The Amazing Race Marching band Sydney Riot of 1879 Kender __cole Polytechnique Reading (activity) Open access Marshall McLuhan Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Chess strategy and tactics Education in Portugal Social rule Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Beatmania IIDX Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination USS Ammen (DD-527) Programme for International Student Assessment Species USS Wallace L.

freshman in days im scared to death and on top of that i have to ride the bus the bus is no big deal in middle school but in high school it seems so awful and i think i mite be turning emo help please to not be scared key be prepared how you will have an opportunity to know your schedule ahead of time so take advantage of that and highlight where all your classes are on a map of the school so you can plan where to go each period and not get lost even better arrive to school half an hour early and walk and find each of your classes before school starts because places don't always appear the same in life as they do on a map it may sound stupid but it's better than looking stupid later in the day when you get lost or arrive to class late because you couldn't find your class or something meet up with your friends before school starts call your buddies up and set up a meeting spot with them for lunch or whenever you can even ask them if they want to come to school early with you so you can both look for your classes wear something comfortable so that you can at least feel comfortable trust me it helps you don't need to go out of your way to wear something you think looks good if it's going to make you feel self conscious or uncomfortable throughout the day besides no one remembers what you wear on the first day of school bring food a water bottle and money and your school supplies and books of course last but not least don't even worry about riding the bus honestly people in high school are so concerned about themselves that they don't even notice who comes on and gets off the bus its not a big deal a bigger deal is making a good impression with your teachers and classmates people in high school are more mature than middle schoolers at the fact that they know just because you ride the bus it doesn't mean you are a complete loser good luck and have fun  Social rule Shaggy dog story Kodocha Doug Pittsburgh Steelers The Catcher in the Rye Great Teacher Onizuka Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Avenue Q Piccolo Junior Saga The Amazing Race The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Recurring South Park characters Garfield Time Out of Mind The Ashlee Simpson Show Jon Secada Milton H.

what would i do in order to form a new school club i want to form a new club well the way i would do it is to find a teacher sponsor first then schedule an appointment with the principal if the principal needs some convincing try to find other schools where similar clubs have been set up and show their success oh and if you could somehow get a survey that showed an abundance of student interest that would most definitely be a good thing  Homeschooling Opportunity rover Lynbrook High School Strange Days at Blake Holsey High St. Joseph's College, Hong Kong Education in Hong Kong School violence Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Recess (TV series) Cornell University Education in the United States Eton College Springfield Elementary School Raffles Institution Summa Theologiae Students' union Albany High School, Georgia Wah Yan College, Hong Kong Education in Germany Secondary education in Japan Daria Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Full Metal Panic?

would cooking at school be helpful to be a dietitian i am interested in becoming a dietitian and i know i have to take maths chemistry and biology but it says nothing about cooking and i have asked people do you think cooking would be a good subject to take to be a dietitian i think that would be a great way to practice what you preach coming up with healthy food items complete with prices and spices with a no salt low salt or low potassium diet etc would be a great way to see how hard it is for people to cook right especially when it comes to a low income i know low potassium diets are a real bear on a budget especially when oranges bananas and canned tomato products are so easily available i think you're thinking ahead of the curve and i like the way you're thinking something like this could bump up your marketability as a new grad to a better job because it shows your dedication to your craft good luck i hope you can pull it off  Potassium Dietitian Raw food diet Microeconomics Food Veganism Tofu Cuisine of Africa Vegetarianism Organic food Tomato Healthy eating Food preservation Labour economics Cuisine of the Southern United States Cheese Stomach cancer Inflation Chili con carne Commodity markets Cuisine of Malaysia Edible salt Economy of the United States Omega-3 fatty acid Macrobiotic diet Atkins Nutritional Approach Cantonese cuisine Sodium chloride French cuisine RuneScape skills Mathematics Ramen Ketchup Plastic Hamburger Bread Hypokalemia Banana Vitamin C Sauerkraut Nutrition Cuisine of the Philippines Supply and demand 2000 Australian Grand Prix Kosher foods Keynesian economics Aluminium Peruvian cuisine Knife Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Barbecue Mayonnaise Prostate cancer The Apprentice 2 French fries Coca-Cola Pottery Salad Tariff Gross domestic product Electrophysiology Salt Economy of Russia Refrigerator car Giffen good Hamster Ecology Supply-side economics Common bean Fire extinguisher RuneScape quests E number Monopoly The Coca-Cola Company Shrimp farm Diet soda Fanta Medicine Economic history of Canada Potassium chloride Graduate school Campbell Soup Company Luck Garlic Professional wrestling slang Milk Bengali cuisine Diet Coke Unemployment Rice Fancy rat Internal ballistics Cuisine of Singapore Cooking Cajun cuisine Marginalism Soul food Genetically modified food Trans fat Potassium iodide

title for essay can anyone help me think of a clever title for my research paper on elementary education i need something a little more interesting than elementary education before any of you give me that as a title i haven't really done any research yet my professor insists that we think up a title before we actually get into writing the paper it's really difficult for me to do it that way we need more details give me your thesis statement what did you find in your research i think i am the greatest paper titler in the world you either need to know the slant you will apply to your research i am of the ilk that says you can find the answer your looking for no matter what and there is no such thing as objectivity but let's say you are by the book and do your research without any predilection as to your findings well in that case you need to write the paper before you title it if you already have an idea of what you will find then give me a thesis and i'll give you a title for instance if you found that elementary schools suck because of the lack of equal resources property tax funding here's a good title mortgaging their future a history of inequity you might replace mortgaging with red lining which is a practice real estate agents use to keep undesirables out of a given neighborhood but if you did this you'd have to include a digressive anecdote about that racist practice if you did a namby pamby feel good essay on inner city teachers making a difference you could give it this title armies of one a history of teaching against all odds but like i said more details ok update your instructor is either retarded or i am misunderstanding something no research paper should have a title before it's written because ideally you do the research and then come to an opinion it doesn't really work that way but teachers work in ideals what i think he wants is to find out what your topic is within elementary education so he can tell you if you are biting off more than you can chew or if youy are being lazy so what he really eants is your topic and probably doesn't give two turns about the aesthetic aspect of your title so think of a topic not a title then name your paper based on the topic you still have to have a topic elementary school education in general is too broad he can't expect you to do a research paper on its entire history get more detail from your instructor on what he wants i have offered two sample topics and titles above inequity in elementary schools sample thesis tax code maintains the racist status quo or profiles of individual elementary school teachers who succeeded in the classroom against all odds there are a million figures like this jaime a escalante is one they made a movie about him called stand and deliver this is a little off topic but a great source for you would be frank mccourt's teacher man it is filled with anecdotes about the teaching profession he taught elementary high school and college and is a fantastic story teller the truth is you shouldn't worry about a title until you have a topic at the very least if it really is a research paper on the entire history of elementary level education and that's your required topic you are screwed because that's a book length topic and the title is the least of your worries but here's a few anyway rearing intellect a history of elementary education or founding thought on elementary education or keystone lessons elementary pedagogy through the years or teachers usually start out with ideals but get run down by the system and end up resenting their students and giving up but it doesn't matter because most teachers are woefully under qualified and are paid like it and they are not held accountable because teacher certification evaluation is full of crap and standardized testing and no child left behind doesn't help because all it does is change the way teachers teach so they wind up just helping kids beat a test as opposed to learning anything useful assuming your topic is not chosen for you once you have your topic give your teacher a tentative title until you have a thesis and once you have a thesis which as far as your teacher should be concerned can only rightly be expected after you've done your research then put a final title on the thing your title is an introduction to your paper and subject a sample of what's coming inside what the tone will be and how it will handle its subject here are a bunch of topics in elementary education beside what i have already suggested dominance of women in teaching profession at elementary level the founding of the american public school system busing of students to integrate schools school vouchers standardized testing of grade school kids effects of no child left behind poor quaity of rural schools failing rural schools certification process for elemntary school teachers use arkansas during bill clinton's leadership as example teacher union and its effect on the quality of education elementary school curriculum book burning in elementary school curriculum in schools run by evangelicals i sincerely hope that something in there helped  Education in Germany

if they teach it in school it must be true if my beliefs were based on intelligent design and i were a student in a history or biology based class who was learning about darwin's origin of species and the theory of evolution would i be required to test and answer questions on these subjects would i be able to opt out it's been psychologically proven that testing on a subject even if it is farce can reinforce that farce in the mind as indiscriminable truth if i gave you a workbook that said the earth is flat and explained to you how and why whether it were true or not and then tested you on the theory the next day grading you based on answering the information according to what you read not necessarily what is true it would begin to reinforce that flawed knowledge in your mind as i have stated previously i am not in school i am a married woman with an occupation but i was curious about opinions on this particular subject usually you can opt out either you or your parent should discuss the issue with the principal if the teacher is unreceptive most principals are scared of parents on this or any other issue if you don't feel heard the media or the principal's bosses usually will listen intently if that still doesn't work consider a national group agency that will help you don't have listen to bunk it's your right not to do so  Teach the Controversy Intelligent design movement Education Philosophy of language Intelligent design Creation science Evolutionary creationism Psychology Kitzmiller v.

money question anyone can answer any ideas guys i need to make to dollars in months i am planning on studying abroad but i don't have the money for it currently i have right now and my parents will pitch in about dollars which means that i only have about to more to go i am and in high school and have a part time job already what can i do to make this large amount of money and am i old enough to get a loan there are lots of opportunities for students to get loans study abroad is a tremendous way to get an education don't give up you can do this you can definitely make in nine months time but you will need a combination of different things going for you maximize your work hours especially overtime if you are eligible babysit for families that pay well when in school try to get the type of job that you can do some homework while you are there for instance high schoolers in my town work at the desk of the park district fitness center and they have to give out keys and fold towels but there is down time to read etc cut your expenses in every way possible for instance no more lattes if your parents give you a week for school lunch then spend only and save the rest you can eat on a day give up lessons and other things that they have to pay for and ask if that money can be added into your total for example say you are a dancer and they pay a month for your classes then ask for that money to go your total if you belong to a church or other organization get them to do a fundraiser for you like a spaghetti dinner where you provide the meal and families sign up ahead buy tickets and come for a dinner at the dinner be prepared to thank them and tell about your plans try to get your money into a moneymarket account that earns or more interest that helps a lot of is don't be shy to ask a relative to help out maybe grandma or an uncle who has no idea that a little donation would make a big difference to you good luck  Student loan Microeconomics Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Wal-Mart Live 8 Graduate school Mutual fund National Kidney Foundation Singapore Little Britain Hyperinflation Theory of conduct Anarchism and capitalism Education in Romania Gross domestic product Wheel of Fortune Inflation Capital accumulation Supply and demand School choice Homeschooling Bank No Child Left Behind Act Day care Insurance Opportunity cost Economic inequality Deflation (economics) Great Teacher Onizuka $ale of the Century FoxTrot Eric Bischoff The Apprentice 2 EastEnders FairTax Life insurance 401(k) GED Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Money Hillary Rodham Clinton Hunter College High School Singlish Advance fee fraud Credit card Surveillance PE ratio Calvin and Hobbes Capitalism Investment bank Education in Germany Privatization Social Security debate (United States) Tuition Make money fast Economics Arthur Laffer Jeopardy!

what are other countries doing i often read the statement that american students are performing lower than average in science and math worldwide if this is true then what are other countries doing to have success in their classrooms one thing to remember when preparing countries is that american students accept all of their students other countries do not special education for students with learning disabilities behavioral problems and mental retardation for the most part doesn't exist especially in the same school other countries also require parents to pay big motivator for parents to pay attention to their kids an economic divider to weed out poor families and students are often required to pass tests to move on to the next level until no child left behind came along this was not the case kids were passed on without much though in other words students in other countries taking these exams are motivated by parents if not intrinsically and these exams are only given to the top percent or so our exams are given to any in pursuit of a high school diploma which is statistically speaking percent or more of a school's population less than about two percent are in pursuit of a certificate of attendance due to a more severe disability  Education in the United States Education in Romania Grade (education) Education Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school GED No Child Left Behind Act Education in Australia SAT Mental retardation Education in Portugal High school Dyslexia Nurse Homeschooling Junior Certificate Affirmative action Physician Test (student assessment) A-level Intelligence quotient Education in Malaysia Education in Germany Advanced Placement Program College admissions Learning disability IB Diploma Programme Hikikomori Juris Doctor Education in Hong Kong Education in Taiwan Education in England Unemployment Economic inequality Education in Finland Numerus clausus Education in Austria Community college Education in Japan College Asperger syndrome General practitioner Education in the Republic of Ireland Education in Singapore Autism Teacher Capitalism National Certificate of Educational Achievement Education in South Korea Education in France Charter school Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Education in Sweden Leaving Certificate Baccalaur__at Eugenics New York State Department of Education Culture of the United States Driver's license Contract Notary public Second language acquisition Education in Scotland Secondary education in France Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination General Certificate of Secondary Education Special education Victorian Certificate of Education Mental illness Intelligent design movement Hunter College High School Education reform Literacy Public education Divorce Multilingual Higher education in Japan Kindergarten Autism epidemic Master's degree Lynbrook High School Physical therapy English as an additional language Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination School choice Boston Public Jaime Escalante Race and intelligence Miami-Dade County Public Schools American and British English differences

does anyone know any high schools in toronto canada that has driving courses i want to learn how to drive when i am years old i am only years old and in grade so i want to know if anyone knows any high schools in toronto that has driving courses or classes thank you typically these are run outside of the school driving classes are not part of the curriculum in ontario high schools you cannot earn credits towards your diploma by learning how to drive if you have the money i highly recommend young driver's they are the most known and respected driving school but they are also the most expensive there are other schools you can look into but keep in mind that you get exactly what you are paying for a cheap driving school will offer fewer in car lessons and less classroom time as well where the pricier ones offer much more classes are usually run on evenings and weekends with day time classes usually only offered in the summer or march break if possible try to pick a school that offers one on one in car lessons there's nothing worse than trying to learn how to drive with two other students sitting in the back seat with you  Education in the United States Graduate school Ontario Academic Credit Education in Germany Education in Singapore College Education in Australia High school Teacher Advanced Placement Program Education in Hong Kong GED Secondary education in the United States Medical school Law school Community college Caulfield Grammar School Education in Taiwan Grade (education) Education in Canada University of Toronto Education in Malaysia Massachusetts Institute of Technology Education in Portugal IB Diploma Programme Queen's University Secondary education in Japan Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Stuyvesant High School Homeschooling National Certificate of Educational Achievement James Ruse Agricultural High School College admissions No Child Left Behind Act Student loan University of Toronto Schools Secondary education in France Education in France Driver's license John De Lorean Mutual fund Physician Education in Albania A-level Worcester Polytechnic Institute Education Indianapolis 500 Lawyer Education in Japan Seneca College Hopkins School Tripartite System Cooper Union York University Australian Qualifications Framework Kindergarten Education in Romania Associate's degree Experiential education Kwantlen University College Sport utility vehicle SAT Gran Turismo (game) The Citadel (Military College) Carnegie Mellon University Education in Sweden School Insurance Brown University Whitewater Hunter College High School Education in England Light rail Education in the Republic of Ireland French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Gwinnett University Center Hillsborough High School Stevens Institute of Technology PLATO Anglo-Chinese School Scarborough RT (TTC) University of Maryland University College Barrister Microeconomics Alexander Technique Taipei American School St. Michael's College School Adult education Distance education Athabasca University Japanese tea ceremony Primary education Pennsylvania State University Upper Canada College Charter school

help when am i going to stop quitting my jobs i've had three jobs this year calling people to get them to donate blood answer all kinds of calls even for a ministry that had us praying for people and then trying to get them to buy things or make donations calling people on the phone to do surveys about anything from snack cakes to pest control i've had to work crazy hours and i haven't made enough money and right now i'm tired i'm tired of quitting jobs but i know i won't advance or thrive on them i only get them to say i have a job i don't even make enough on them to pay off the stupid credit cards i got in college i want to go back to college but i want to work too recently i had an interview with an airlines company i had phone interviews being a flight attendant could totally change my life i've never made over buck an hour in my lifetime and they get paid over but they have limited hours it would take me away from here but i wouldn't be able to go to school and i don't want to retire at as a flight attendant i know some people who have had really good jobs making good money but when the company closes down or they get terminated they have to start all over again with a degree i'd have a better chance i just don't know what to do and i look like a loser upside of being a flight attendant it is a fun job you get to travel to new places meet new people and fly for free now for the downside of the job it is a lot hard work passangers and other fas are not nice you work a lot of hours and the pay is really low for what you are actually doing i worked as a flight attendant and i was guaranteed flight hours a month my pay was an hour but i only get paid for flight time so if the flight is only hours you get paid for just that time i would work to hours days however because the flight time was only for a total of hours that is all i would get paid for for the first couple of years you will probably sit reserve which means you would be on call for hours a day and only get paid for of those hours i am not say that it is not a good job i love it i only left because i decided to go back to school to become a teacher if you want more info on being a flight attendant email me at txldybug aol com good luck  The Amazing Race Social rule United Airlines Flight 93 Poker jargon Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Surveillance Married... with Children Craps Education in Germany Education in the People's Republic of China Anderson Cooper 2000 Australian Grand Prix Time Out of Mind Ocean's Twelve Unemployment Delta Air Lines Airline Internet fraud Avenue Q Kodocha Friends Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Air traffic controller Graduate school Humphrey Bogart Playoff Game show Sharon Tate Hyperinflation Monopoly (game) Ben Johnson (athlete) Wal-Mart 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Pitaten Wheel of Fortune Education in the United States Athenian democracy The Sims 2: University America Online Advance fee fraud Muslim ibn Aqeel Make money fast Eddie August Schneider Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Catcher in the Rye MMORPG Current teachings of Prem Rawat Apollo 8 Price discrimination Blonde on Blonde Student loan Little Britain Professional wrestling match types Capitalism Winning Streak Paragliding John Forsythe Cindy Sheehan Satchel Paige Ryanair Meat Loaf Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

registered nurse help hi i want to be a registered nurse or i just want to get a bachelor's degree in science but i dont know how to get it i understand you have to college and all duhh i'm a junior in high school colleges universities scholarships so many things whats the difference between college and university how long will it take me to get a bachelor's degree how should i look for good scholarships their are so many that they confuse me what are some good colleges any other information would be nice please and thank youu sooo much btw i live in va or phd whichever is highest well college and university are essentially the same at least here in the us i believe universities offer more degrees than colleges check this link out it gives you more explanation http wiki answers com q what is the difference between a college and a university ba generally averages around years you can finish earlier if you take a lot of credits at once but you may also take additional years if you double major add a minor or your program is a year program for bachelor in general science you are probably looking at years however some bsn bachelor of science in nursing you may be looking at years because you may have to add practicum etc it mostly depends on the schools you apply to fastweb com is a good resource for scholarship also you want to research the schools of your choice and contact their financial aid offices to get more information on scholarship grants and general financial aid starts with fastweb com or google scholarship generally universities offer their own scholarships based on need merit community involvement etc since you are from virginia it is cheaper if you go to a university in virginia itself so that you can save on tuition as in state tuition usually is at least cheaper than out of state tuition at public colleges so try to apply to your state universities it looks like for nursing you have many choices university of virginia virginia school of nursing west virginia university you should not choose a university based on its ranking while ranking is important it is more important how the university treats its students and what kind of support is available often time a local university has a smaller classroom or the professors are more approachable and friendlier you should check out the school that has the best success rate in terms of placing its graduates in the workplace i would say start talking to your counselors and ask for guidance also start researching online different schools and requirements to get into nursing school as well as funding good luck to you  Graduate school Scholarship Education in Portugal Education in Germany College Education in Australia Nurse Student loan Community college Chinese University of Hong Kong Law school Pennsylvania State University Northeastern University, Boston Doctor of Philosophy Master's degree Columbia University University of Central Florida Athabasca University College admissions University of Toronto Duke University Lawyer Education in Hong Kong Teacher University of Michigan Physician Education in Japan Bachelor of Arts University of Pittsburgh Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology Academia Kwantlen University College Education in Canada Education in Romania Medical school Brown University Franklin W.

question about college loans and jobs im going to college in the fall and i was wondering if i can get a loan to pay off my college so i dont have to work while im in school the reason is because i want to go to school full time which is four years so i dont think i can work if i need time to do homework and study think its a good idea thanks for evey answer yes and no i did the same thing that you are about to do and i regret it i wish i would have just worked and took care of my financial debt as it occurred you need to weigh out two things is it possible for you to work and go to school full time if not then you are going to have to get loans if you can work are you dedicated enough to keep your grades up and miss out on some social activities again if not you need to get the loans the problem with loans is that you literally forget about them then when you get out of school and you are thinking about all of this money to be made and getting a new car and a house ect you realized that you still have to pay off those nagging college loans so my advice is to avoid them if you can do it now for one more bit of bonus advice if i were you i would look for a nearby junior college or community college to take your first two years these colleges have transferrable degrees and can save you thousands of dollars over going straight to a university when you finish at your community college you will be ahead of your peers already you will have an associates degree while they have no degree yet and you will transfer in as a junior just like them only with little or no debt this is a great way to save big and even gain an advantage from it i hope this helps and if you need any more advice let me know  Education in the United States Mortgage Student loan Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Japan Avenue Q Deflation (economics) Community college College Education in Germany Hyperinflation Mutual fund Life insurance Portsmouth F.C.

my third son wants to pay plus accomadation costs to go on a three day motivation course down in london but i think that it is a complete waste of time and money he swears that he has friends who have been on it and claim that it has changed their lives he has always been a bit of a drifter unlike my other three but i made sure that he got through school and so on and what he does now is up to him but he does have a good job and writes too so i can't see the problem he says that he will send me details of this particular course called landmark or somesuch but i am sceptical and wouldn't want him to waste his money does anyone know anything about these courses and what they are all about i am also worried that in his case such a course could actually do harm and he would be better off having a good holiday hello steve no my son has his own place over in hull my youngest boy moved out just over a year ago and i have told all of them that even though they would be welcome back here temorarily in a real emergency i am entitled to my own home these days after bringing four of them on my own up in a two bedroomed house i taught them to stand on their own two feet which is why him talking about this course suprises me i tend to trust the guardian newspaper so have posted you this which you may find helpful http observer guardian co uk uk news story html there is also something on wikipedia if you look up landmark seminars landmark seminars used to be called the est forum my ex husband did several of them at that time and has survived and is also a writer he doesn't do them now it was something though he felt he had to do at the time some people say they are dangerous and a 'cult' and you will find all sorts of alarmist stories on the cult busting websites but they are always one sided and maybe from individuals wanting to blame someone else for their own difficulties i have to warn you though which may explain the 'cult' label that people often tend not to want to stop at one seminar or training and go on to do others my husband did and your son well may if he can afford them there's nothing you can really do about it although it may be difficult for you i think there is still the element of secrecy which will mean that he won't be able to tell you much about what happened there he may also try to get you to do one too my husband did but failed please don't worry i think you just have to be supportive and patient and try not to criticise what he's doing too much i personally don't like the whole thing but we all have to make our own choices good luck to you both  Social rule Theory of conduct Piccolo Junior Saga Plame affair Shaggy dog story Landmark Education Past teachings of Prem Rawat Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Neuro-linguistic programming The Star Wars Holiday Special Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Internet troll The Skeptical Environmentalist Milton H.

does anybody know the difference between c c c and c mouth piece for the trumpet well i have been playin the trumpet for about years now and i heard that the more that u progress u should get a lower numbered mouth piece and i just wanted to know what the difference was between them all the more experience that you have playing the trumpet the more air you have learned to put thu the mouth piece you will begin to learn to get your air from your diaphragm and not from your lungs which will not let you hold your notes as long so when you begin you will need a bigger mouth piece so you can get all the air into the trumpet you can get and also as you grow your mouth will to and thus you will need a smaller one so none of the air goes out side or around your piece it is kind of like a clarinet player and reeds when you are a beginner you will need a size and then you progress into a different size if you hold up a sheet of paper and you blow on it and it is a heavy paper you will need more air to make it flutter as a piece of paper that is thin does not take as much air to make it flutter or move with the wind or air you are blowing on it the same goes with a mouth piece that you use the stronger your lips get and the more you use your diaphragm the smaller size mouth piece you will need and the better sound will come out and it will be pure and clear as to muffled and forced and you can hold your notes out longer  Clarinet Trumpet Big band Saxophone Mouthpiece Harmonic series (music) Trombone Harmonica Hornbostel-Sachs Flute Woodwind instrument Bong Bassoon Bagpipes Transposing instrument Alto horn Authentic performance Diving regulator Timpani Violin Mute (music) A Day in the Life Concert band Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Rigging Vowel Pneumothorax Marching band Two-stroke cycle Drowning Wood Cornet Cello Manner of articulation Oral sex Anemometer Breaststroke Vibrato Western concert flute Ney Carburetor Shogi Textile manufacturing Traditional animation Go (board game) Stuttering Backstroke Tetrapod Horn (instrument) Front crawl Microphone Double bass Music genre Chopsticks Lung Paragliding Scuba set Drill bit The Waterboys Recorder Puberty Internal ballistics Axial compressor Musical instrument classification Reed (music) Respiratory system Weather lore Taikyoku shogi Voiceless palatal-velar fricative Oboe Dominoes Equine conformation Mattress Bass clarinet Chess strategy and tactics Kitesurfing Brass instrument Gramophone record Loudspeaker Viola Anton Webern Glass Conducting Gaida Skateboarding trick Terminal ballistics Phil Collins Key (music) Brass band Pet Sounds Mario Davidovsky Miles Davis Diving suit Radio controlled airplane Ko shogi Warrant Officer Fixed-wing aircraft Jazz Tet Offensive

how do you study does anyone have any study tips notecards are no longer working for me i've returned to school after many years and i've realized that now that i'm older its very difficult for me to retain information especially if i find it boring ex physiology aaaahh how i miss the days when i could just show up to class and everything would just somehow sink in anyways i've tried reading the textbooks and making notecards and that doesnt really help i havent been getting the best grades in my classes and it feels like i m overloading my brain i've never had to study in my life so its a challenge for me please anyone how do you study first of all find an environment that let's you concentrate best some people need to leave their home or they get distracted by t v bed so sleepy less important chores etc being in public forces them to study others get too distracted by studying in public e g oh it's much more interesting to people watch than study right now some like it quiet others like background noise this is is really important work towards your learning style if you're a visual learner try to take notes with a lot of graphs and charts and illustrations if you're an auditory learner you could possibly summarize out loud paragraphs you've read or run a q a with a friend based on the text if you're a kinesthetic learner involves sense of touch and body movement maybe you can work with a physiology model or somehow enact the information you are reading about don't know how that would really work maybe pointing to yourself when memorizing parts of the anatomy of course no one exclusively works within one style of learning but sometimes it's easier for a person to work in one area than another as a teacher whenever i assign reading to students i usually provide key questions to provide focus for a given reading it's important for students to have goals when reading new text because it compels them to look for specific information and develop ideas otherwise they sometimes read without any true active understanding of the text if your instructor hasn't already done so you could ask for him or her to come up with some guideline questions for assigned readings these questions are for your benefit so answer them as you complete your reading also when you're reading write down your own questions and insights keep the reading process active some people work better with a partner if you think you are one of those then do so collaborative learning can be beneficial for both parties even when one person knows more than the other studies have shown that the tutor actually can benefit slightly more from than the tutee because the tutor has to clearly articulate his or her own understanding of the material which provides a kind of mental reinforcement of the tutor's knowledge to make sure your collaborative studying is effective make sure you both come to the table with questions about the reading material obviously this assumes you've already read the material on your own finally students only really absorb material if they believe the subject has relevance in their life so even in a topic like physiology that seems boring to you you must clearly establish in a positive way how the subject matter could be beneficial to you in your life for example so i can pass this class is not much of a motivator but thinking i study physiology so i'll have a better understanding of what goes on in each csi television series might be a better motivator hope that helps  GED Motivation Social psychology Second language acquisition Asperger syndrome Dyslexia Education Education in the People's Republic of China Autism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Martial art Neuro-linguistic programming Biology Intelligent design movement Homeschooling Sleep Scientology beliefs and practices Graduate school Expert system Logic Plame affair Hearing impairment Test (student assessment) Educational animation Mathematics Scientific method Cognitive science Psychology Past teachings of Prem Rawat Aristotle Botany Economics Current teachings of Prem Rawat Philosophy of language Education in the United States Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Philosophy of education Hypnosis Sexual orientation Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Species Enterprise content management Open access Traumatic incident reduction Metacognition Meditation Strategic management Out-of-body experience Franz Boas Normal distribution Aikido Psychosis Experiential education Aphasia Ethics Tai Chi Chuan No Child Left Behind Act Milton H.

i need some advice and info on culinary school i'm a junior in highschool i need some info on just everything about culinary school can someone that went to culinary school take time to contact me through this give me some advice more than anything you want to make sure you have the aptitude and desire to complete culinary school getting in is easy but finishing is not culinary school costs a lot of money and they usually will get you set up with student loans to finance those loans come due after you finish or quit lots of schools reel students in with promises of success financial aid only to have them wash out after a month or so after having paid high in tuition through student loans the school gets its money and makes its profit while the students wash out and are left in heavy debt student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy which makes it even worse so look before you leap to find a school that is reputable i would first go through the local ads and yellow pages to identify local culinary schools then call the better business bureau to see if any have complaints if a school has more than a couple of complaints cross it off your list once you've narrowed your list then go to a few of the better restaurants in your area and find out where their chefs went to school and if you can talk to the chefs directly find out what they thought of their schools and if they would recommend them ask restaurant managers what schools they typically use for finding new chefs and why once you've done this homework you should have your list down to just a few schools and you can visit ane make your decision based on environment and cost good luck  Graduate school Student loan Education in the United States Citigroup Education in the People's Republic of China Monetary policy Unemployment Inflation Bank Education in Romania Economics Deflation (economics) Interest Bond Credit card GED Debt Economy of the United States Personal finance Finance Mortgage Students' union Tuition Mutual fund Corporate finance College admissions Capital accumulation Stock Wal-Mart Predatory lending Fractional-reserve banking Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Schabir Shaik Trial Theory of conduct The Amazing Race Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mergers and acquisitions Asian financial crisis Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Microeconomics High school Babe Ruth Islamic banking Newspaper Great Teacher Onizuka Price discrimination Bankruptcy Islamic economics Recipe Barrister Great Depression Culinary Institute of America University of Pretoria Primerica Financial Services Corporation Appeal Education in New Zealand Expert system Public education Financial markets Education in Hong Kong Financial aid Education in Germany Jamie Oliver George W.

what should i do i'm serious i think the younger kids are smarter than me do you also feel the pressure so what there is always going to be someone who is smarter than you don't let it rule your life you must enjoy doing one or more things right find those things you have a passion for then get even better at them because you like spending time doing them to the point that everyone will come to you for answers about or help with that particular thing for example you enjoy drawing so experiment using different mediums chalk pencil ink water colors oils etc to find which one you prefer to work in perhaps exploring this will lead you to become a great artist or perhaps you'll find out that working with clay sculpting is more your thing just follow something you like doing until you find something you enjoy doing more be open to new things develop who you really are don't lead your life dependent on how someone else leads theirs be yourself like yourself  Drawing M.C.

i made a fake report card and let my parents see it but i feel so wrong ok um im going to th grade and in th grade i didnt do good i made a fake report card showing all as the real one had bs and cs my parents wouldnt like that so they sent the real one to my house and i switched the real one with the fake one my parents saw it and were proud of me my mom gave me for it now i already spent it then suddenly i had to register for another school district and i had to show my report card and get my documents from a different high school and they had a copy of the real report card and my mom looked at it and said this one is wrong but in great relief she thought it was a mistake from the computer so she threw the real copy of the report card away so we arrived at the registration place and they checked everything and including my fake report card so again i got away with it but they made copies of everything and will send them to the high school im going to but im afraid the high school will get the real report card and fake one what should i do do you fear that your mom will just get mad or that she will beat you too hopefully she will just be mad and not abusive if you think your mom will be abusive then you might want to contact another adult that you trust and ask them to be with you but you need to come clean with your mom you might want to think about what a reasonable consequence might be for falsifying your report card and lying to you mom you could then say how sorry you are for doing what you did and describe how it has been eating away at you but you know it was wrong and that it is wrong to continue to withhold the truth ask your mom to forgive you and offer your idea of the consequence you thought of then you have to leave it up to her as to what happens next hopefully your mom will be reasonable and the school will be too however if you are not sincere about knowing it was wrong and repenting for your misdeed then that will show through and it will just be that much worse for you  EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Repentance Plame affair Theory of conduct Social rule Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints One Tree Hill (TV series) Killian documents Poker jargon Sin Domestic violence Kodocha Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Internet fraud Piccolo Junior Saga The Adventures of Pete & Pete Springfield Elementary School Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story No Child Left Behind Act Bank fraud Indian nationality law Phishing Knots Landing Garfield Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Homeschooling RuneScape cheats Futurama (TV series - season 2) Cheating in poker George Costanza Infantilism The Fairly OddParents The Daleks' Master Plan Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Fathers' rights Out-of-body experience 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Merit Datalore (TNG episode) The Battle (TNG episode) Classified information Little Britain Determinism Science 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression The Emancipation of Mimi Grade (education) Daredevil 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Autism rights movement Yu-Gi-Oh!

how do i write a resume cover letter to apply for a graphic design job if i have only college experience help this is always difficult but don't dispair the best thing to do it look at the job offer and list the qualifications skills and anything else the employer is asking for once you have this it is time to write the cover letter try and match yourself as close as possible to each requirement if the say they need computer skills but you have done no computer courses write that you have worked on various computer packages ms word etc in prepairing for you projects at college don't be afraid to say that you do not have specific experiance but always make up for it by saying you have the ability to learn quickly and you are confident that you will be sucessful in all aspects of the position in my experiance companies would rather pay less and get someone with potential they can train with the outcome of having an employee with the skills and paying them less than an experianced person from the start paying them more remember the resume only gets you to the interview stage it is there that you need to be confident and truly beleive you are the right person for the job i always say that if you approch everything with an extremely positive mind and try and suppress the thought of i am not good enough you will succeed chin up and if you get a knock back and you are not offered the job than dont worry because the people interviewing you know what they are looking for always be yourself as the interviewee does not want to be in the position of employing someone they thought was something else if you are not the right person for the job accept that it does not mean you are not good enough rather that you would not fit in that specific work environment  Social rule Requirements analysis Software engineering Economic inequality Unemployment Scientology beliefs and practices Steve Jobs Computer Education in Germany Plame affair Graduate school Apprenticeship Milton H.

year of h ll coming up okay at my high school sophmore year is h ll according to the teachers i am going to be a sophmore in the upcoming school year what are some good study habits i can adapt to help me to get above a gpa first of all its great to hear from a highschooler who's actually concerned about her future and who wants to do something to optimize her possibilities of success that's the first thing you're on the right track here's some ideas that have worked miracles for me they may or may not work for you but you never know 'till you give them a try for studying terms and formulas and anything else that can fit on a x notecard make a colorful yet simple card with whatever information you need to know and place them at various places throughout your house you will see them and absorb the information unconsciously because you're seeing it all the time if necessary during an exam you can even visualize the location of the notecard in your house and it might help you recall the information the other reason why this works is repetition and frequency the more often you're exposed to certain information and knowledge the easier and more thoroughly your brain assimilates it for things requiring diagrams or drawn out explanations get a small poster board draw it out label the things that need to be labeled and post it in your room where you can glance at it from time to time visual aids while not a complete study technique will help solidify the information you're learning in class and studying at home if you haven't already set aside a special place for studying make it cozy comfortable and inviting so that you want to study there an intellectual refuge of sorts make sure you include good lighting and maybe a few items that make you happy or remind you of how important your future is to you teddy bear pennant or bumper sticker from a prospective college you'd like to attend etc discover whether you're the type that learns better in silence or with background noise i personally study better if there's other sounds going on i can't learn worth a darn in complete silence find out what works for you and make it happen for me if i listen to the same song s while studying certain information like concepts definitions and vocabulary type things during test time i can hear the song in my head and instantly recall the information i studied while listening to it most importantly study consistently make a point of dedicating a specific block of time each day to study your various subjects stick to it make it be known to all who may disturb you that those are your studying hours and to contact you when they're over all friends and family who support you in reaching your future goals will support you in this anyone who disregards your wishes is disregarding your concern for your future take breaks and know that the human mind is strained when its asked to concentrate for more than minutes at a time get up stretch get a glass of water something but keep it to about minutes of break time for every hour breaks are just as important to learning as the study time again a rest for the brain gives it a chance to file away the information you just gave it eat right exercise and get plenty of sleep those too are important in keeping your academics in tip top condition make time for fun when your work is done its a reward and motivates you to keep up your good hard work which will pay off immensely good luck to you  Second language acquisition Grade (education) MP3 Extreme Programming Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Education in Romania Poker jargon Past teachings of Prem Rawat Consensus decision-making Social psychology Social rule Hearing impairment Logic David Hume John Cage Plame affair Out-of-body experience Cognitive science I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Traumatic incident reduction Doomsday argument Psychology Animal Crossing Shaggy dog story Mnemonic CPU cache Happiness Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban College admissions Stereoscopy Quizbowl Music Dyslexia Supernatural Dream Marching band Internet troll Aikido Autism Surveillance A Course In Miracles Education in Germany Graduate school Memory Education in Japan Time Out of Mind Neopets Avenue Q Education in the People's Republic of China Tai Chi Chuan Gmail Theory of conduct The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Strategic management Ra (board game) Deconstruction Education in the United States Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Randomness Hypnosis Pinball Phaedo Alexander Technique Storytelling Columbine High School massacre The Silence of the Lambs Consciousness Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Socrates Joke Education Pitaten Sleep Final Fantasy magic She Loves You Weight training Electrophysiology Economics Neuro-linguistic programming Current teachings of Prem Rawat Microphone Clinical depression Theodicy High school Game show Coffee Kitchen Tonality Advertising

amount of reading in biology or chemistry i am deciding between chemistry and biology both ap i was wondering on average how many pages would students have to read each night i normally cannot keep up with the reading biology is definitely more reading than chemistry but chemistry is a lot more of working out problems if your math algebra level no calculus is stronger or faster than reading then chemistry is definitely the way to go it's much more conceptual and math based of course there is still reading involved expect a couple of sections pages a night biology on the other hand involves a lot of facts reading and memorization it's hard to say how much you'd have to read a lot of that depends on your teacher and how much material you're able to cover in class you may find yourself reading pages a night but it depends and you probably wouldn't have to do that every single day  Mathematics Physics Advanced Placement Program Education in Taiwan SAT Science Education in the United States Calculus No Child Left Behind Act Chemistry Molecular biology Mnemonic Stuyvesant High School Troy High School Clements High School Dyslexia Graduate school Temperature Secondary education in the United States Computer Theory of conduct Education CPU cache Electrophysiology Massachusetts Institute of Technology Jaime Escalante W.

highschool c uhm my first day of highschool is this friday any advice on being a freshman joining clubs sports studying friends all highschool stuff my advice be yourself no one likes someone who turns out to be a fake just walk in smiling and everyone will like you from the start just don't suck up to the teachers too much you want to seem like you're on the side of the other students with clubs and sports it should be relatively easy to ask someone about them like a new friend who is in the spanish club or the field hockey team or whatever as for studying i would totally suggest doing all of your homework and honestly putting some effort into it since whatever happens from the moment you step into those doors goes on your record and things might happen you don't want colleges to see yes i know it seems really far off but these four years of your life will go by incredibly fast so yeah if you need any more advice drop me a line i've been out of high school for a year and i'm starting my sophomore year at bucknell u oh yeah one more thing be open to change since a lot of things are going to be different from now on  Jon Secada Student Lynbrook High School Little Britain She Loves You Bucknell University Shaggy dog story Michigan State University Social rule Yearbook Education in the United States Playoff Merrimack College Can't Hardly Wait Theory of conduct Brown University Secondary education The College of New Jersey Columbia University The Citadel (Military College) Sport Boston University Washington State University Clements High School Trinity College, Dublin Columbine High School massacre FoxTrot Georgetown University Kyle Broflovski Texas A&M University University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Hiberno-English J.P.

how reliable are edu or gov sites my english teacher told my class that we could only use edu or gov websites for internet research i understand that it would be impossible for her to check nearly students' sources but i was stilled bothered her poilcy many edu sources i found were research papers by students or professors which i wouldn't consider credible information necessarily i wasn't able to find any gov research it was a literary project this teacher also forbid time and newsweek articles claiming that they were nothing but gossip although i turned this project in many months ago i'm curious for my own sake how to determine an internet source credible are there certain domain names or is it a case by case basis how reliable are edu sites anyway surely edu sites contain as much opinion as newspapers or news magazines and as a side note in what situations are news magazines credible sources perhaps with biographical info but not political analysis thank you any source web or print is only as credible as the person who provided the information some are incredibly reliable and some are not the idea behind wanting edu and gov sources is that these often cite their sources news magazines may well be filled with facts but they don't often cite their source of information any better than a spokesman from said and that doesn't cut it in academic research remember a credible source doesn't have to be correct it simply has to be reliable you get the same answer all the time the news may well be accurate but generally speaking you're getting the information second hand it becomes a secondary and not primary source let's say you're writing about the value of education in terms of increased income and a newspaper wrote a story about it using the statistics from the census bureau wouldn't you rather use the same stats and see if you reach the same conclusion as the reporter if you're writing a research paper if you're reading biographical sometimes the news is a valid source of information an obituary for example might be acceptable to source in a paper most news isn't original research it's reporting so it's not a source with some few exceptions there is a lot of government research out there you can look at this popular gov that many news people use for their source material and ideas http www fedstats gov more information than anyone wants to know and you helped or will help pay for it also i use google scholar a lot it can help provide you with plenty of scholarly journals to use as source material and very very few teachers will disapprove of the use of a scholarly journal as a source the difference between these and things like newsweek is that to get published in a scholarly journal think new england journal of medicine a group of experts in the field have to agree that your work is acceptable and correct in news the reporter decides what to write and the editor says yes or no plenty of errors get through  Plame affair John Lott Wikipedia Plagiarism Open access Academic publishing Downing Street memo The Bell Curve Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda World Wide Web Karl Rove Roswell UFO incident Newspaper 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, exit polls Bogdanov Affair Debugging Economics Publishing Deconstruction Cross site scripting Scientific journal Plame affair timeline Philosophical skepticism Killian documents Peer review 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Hutton Inquiry Condon Committee Science Scholarly method Public domain Bigfoot The Skeptical Environmentalist Academia Teach the Controversy Race and intelligence Professor Standardized testing Biblical inerrancy Copyright The Standard Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Logic Noam Chomsky Scientology beliefs and practices The Washington Times Domain Name System Drudge Report Graduate school Ann Coulter Journalism ethics and standards Media bias in the United States Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Ye Shengtao Slander and libel Alcoholics Anonymous Education The Bible and history Autism Ming Pao Historical method Education in the United States Aesthetic Realism Software engineering Talmud Expert system Computer virus New Testament Jacob Neusner Solar variation Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Anonymous remailer Criticism of Prem Rawat Floppy disk GED Novel Style guide Bj__rn Lomborg Asperger syndrome Advocacy journalism The New York Times Technology Review Fair use Chronology of the Ancient Near East Mass media Freedom of the press Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Age of the Earth Joseph C.

how is it like to work at mcdonalds i need a job any ideas where i could start working at entry level i dont have any experience but i am willing to do anything i am not sure where i could find a job thank you for your comment hey i'm in pretty much your same position although i have a bit of work experience it's been really hard for me to find a job been trying all summer applied to places so far although all of my friends got the second or third job they applied for even though they had the same or less job experience just luck of the draw i suppose pretty much any place you walk into that has a help wanted sign apply to don't be afraid to call or walk in and ask how the hiring is going so that the person hiring can put a name to a face otherwise you're just another piece of paper on a stack if you are uncomfortable with your lack of job experience make a resume including all of your school accomplishments and extracurricular activities and turn in with application ask friends or relatives to keep an eye out for places that are hiring also it is a bit late now but a lot of cities have a special teen employment program for the summer maybe next year you can look into that some schools have a class that helps you to get a job and you work during their block ask your counselor about this finally just because you have a good feeling from a job possibility or interview do not stop applying for anything else good luck hope you fare better than i have so far actually though i have a promising interview at k mart next week so who knows edit the vast majority of kids i see outside of school working are working at restaurants fast food or sit down so maybe put some extra effort into that job area  Social rule 2000 Australian Grand Prix Education in the United States Graduate school Unemployment Friends Software engineering Education in the People's Republic of China Philip J.

in the uk can you do two degrees at once i dnt mean joint honours i mean seperate degrees thanks it's extremely unlikely that any university would let you do this and why would you want to the only option would be to do both degrees part time or one degree full time and then a second one full time afterwards either way you're looking at years of study and the slc as far as i know will only provide one lot of funding so you'd have to fund the second degree yourself  Bachelor's degree Graduate school Master's degree University of Calgary Students' Union Trinity College, Dublin Bologna process Academic degree Chinese University of Hong Kong Education in the United States Top-up fees Education in Canada Australian Qualifications Framework Education in Finland Education in Australia Student loan British degree abbreviations Bachelor of Arts University of King's College Australian Defence Force Academy British undergraduate degree classification Medical school Doctor of Philosophy Education in Hong Kong Telephone exchange Memorial University of Newfoundland College Associate's degree California State University Structure of the British Army City and Guilds of London Institute University of Dundee Oregon State University Education in Germany Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology Sir John Randall Education in Austria Juris Doctor Doctorate Philosophy, Politics and Economics University of Toronto Dentistry Open University College admissions No Child Left Behind Act Bachelor of Music Open access Carpal tunnel syndrome University of Maryland Baltimore County J.

yeah so im starting high school tomorrow anyone have any advice or tips or anything all help would definately be appricated d hopefully you know some people from middle school junior high that can help you transition from the different schools however i suggest that you begin by talking to new people in your classes just introduce yourself to the person next to you because they are probably just as nervous as you are ask if you can borrow a pen if nothing else to better help the transition you should also try to find out what clubs and organizations your school has that you might be interested in the more you try out the more likely you are to find long lasting friends most of all just don't worry about everything that goes wrong you will make mistakes and probably embarrass yourself but nobody will remember later rely on the people you can and meet as many new people as possible because it will make your experience so much better  Social rule Jon Secada One Tree Hill (TV series) The Ashlee Simpson Show Can't Hardly Wait Little Britain Graduate school Good Morning, Vietnam Middle school Piccolo Junior Saga Alcoholics Anonymous Anxiety A Course In Miracles The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Hypnosis The Beatles Friends Hiberno-English Beetle in an Anthill Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Yoko Ono Transsexuality The Lovely Bones She Loves You Extras (sitcom) Carl Barks Donald Rumsfeld Shaggy dog story Psychosis Renaissance The Day After Tomorrow High school Education in the United States Year of the Spider The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Socrates Development of Darwin's theory Saved by the Bell Inception of Darwin's theory Theory of conduct Debate Blood on the Tracks Milton H.

in a speech inspite having been soo confident i forgot all my lines i got tenced and nervous then started again my friends and my teachers had very much hopes for me and i cant face them my attitude has lost help we all get nervous making speeches it's one of the hardest things to do if you are not a natural entertainer i agree with the other guy use notes i find it best to have a list of key words that lead me through what i want to say that way it doesn't sound like i'm just reading it the best advice i can think of for now is to forget about what other people might think you are who you are and you're probably a wonderful person no body can blame you for being nervous after all you did the best thing you could and that was to compose yourself and start again the best advice for the future is to prepare well for it  Social rule 2004 Republican National Convention The Dalek Invasion of Earth Religious Society of Friends Meat Loaf Recurring South Park characters Theory of conduct Piccolo Junior Saga Avenue Q Brian Griffin The Ashlee Simpson Show Philipp Melanchthon Hearing impairment Kim Possible Nightmares (Buffy episode) Friends Coming of Age (TNG episode) Shaggy dog story Stuttering Pok__mon Live!

senior project well this year is going to be my senior year and i don't really know what to do for my senior project but i was thinking about doing something on my twin brother and sister they are years old and my brother has down syndrome but his twin sister doesn't i was thinking of doing some kind of comparison or something anyone have any ideas on what i can do with that any ideas are much appreciated well you obviously have a start you can do some sort of research project but that depends on your school they will probably ask you to go deeper and make that into a video documentary or work with doctors to create a more professional project look at the overall requirements you need then consider if your plans will fulfill them i would recommend to go a bit over the requirements since it will allow you a buffer if you fall short of fulfilling the time or materials requirement overall i would tell you to convert the project to a video documentary with everything possible interviews with doctors you working with doctors you talking with your sibilings stuff like that  Douglas Adams Extreme Programming Laserdisc Theory of conduct Physician Ludwig Wittgenstein Juris Doctor Reiki The Ashlee Simpson Show Claude L__vi-Strauss Architect Graduate school W.

why do schools favor the primary parent divorce especially those earning more income don't they teachers staff and administrators realize how difficult this is for the student in the u s many students come from dual or two family households the secondary parent does not like to be treated unfairly and out of the loop and the child does not like witnessing this joint shared custody secondary parent lives in different city due to job child goes back and forth sounds like you are speaking from a specific experience and i'm not sure i can answer your question without more information in my experience although my husband and i are together the school personnel typically directs personal correspondence to me as i am the parent that most often appears at the school to volunteer attend meetings and signs the notes we send back in to the school the school sends home one 'packet' of information for each student and expects that whatever 'internal' communication that needs to happen between parents whether living together or separate will happen as long as there is no court order to the contrary both parents have an equal right to information from the school and to participate in their child's education if you are not receiving the information from your child's other parent then make an appointment with the teacher and brainstorm how he she can get the information to you this may involve some work effort on your part but the teacher should be so grateful that you want to be involved that they are willing to do their part too some possible suggestions the teacher keeps a manilla envelope with your name on it and deposits all the regular notes announcements in it that are sent home during the week you pick the packet up at the school on friday leaving the envelope for the next week if picking it up is not possible go ahead and prestamp a stack of envelopes for teacher to use to mail them to you once a week if the teacher communicates via email ask to be added to the email list ask the principal to add your number to the phone message list that way you'll get those telephone messages about special events and pta meetings make sure the teacher has your phone number and knows to call you too anytime she's calling all the other parents if you're not getting respect from the teacher talk to the principal if you're not getting respect from the principal call the county office and ask to speak with the person who supervises the principals that's usually pretty effective good luck  Plame affair Education in the People's Republic of China E-mail Voice over IP Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Homeschooling FidoNet Direct marketing School choice Education in the United States No Child Left Behind Act Password Education in Germany Surveillance GSM services SAT Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Social rule Cindy Sheehan French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses ARPANET Secondary education in France Divorce Public-key cryptography Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Gmail Education Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses Email authentication Teacher Child support Sender Policy Framework Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Internet fraud Communications protocol Wheel of Fortune Education in Japan Religious Society of Friends Boston Public Karl Rove Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Charter school Short message service Pretty Good Privacy Quizbowl Education in Hong Kong Education in Portugal Catechism Intelligent design movement UK telephone numbering plan Appeal High school Israeli Arab Graduate school Skype Stopping e-mail abuse E-mail spam Packet switching AppleTalk Cellular network Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Lord Chancellor Modem Plame affair timeline Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 Spam (electronic) Separation of church and state Franklin W.

should i move before my senior yr of hs ten point for best answer i need more opinions ok i've spent two years at my high school in ri and am in the top of my class i have also made many great friends however i'm almost definately moving after my junior year to ny where i will spend my senior year i have made many friends to where i might move because my family lives there and that is where i spend much of my summer however their hs doesn't have italian i'm in italian honors next year and italian eep sr year so at my new hs i won't have a language my sr yr because they have no italian will this affect my college opportunities will this move affect my class rank and gpa because schools weight classes differently this hs is more competitive will new high schools look at my transcript and actually weight my grades how they weight theirs or will i just not be counted in the class rank or even just moved unfairly back in rank because they didn't weight it right now i'm in the top of my class should i move with all the effort you've put in to being successful at your present school and considering the class standing that you've attained you are right to be concerned about potentially losing that standing when you're on the verge of graduating your class standing and course availability at the new school could have a dramatic impact on which colleges admit you and the amount of financial aid you may receive i recommend sitting down with a counselor or talking on the phone or via e mail from the new school to find out exactly what will happen with your grades transferring and approximately where your current grades will place you in the new school if the answers are not satisfactory do you have relatives or a close friend with whom you could stay and finish at your present school if the answers are satisfactory then you want to consider whether or years at the new school will be best for you from a social perspective being the new kid's always tough but a second year is not likely to make a big difference good luck  Grade (education) Education in the United States Graduate school High school New Trier High School Education in the People's Republic of China Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy College admissions The Citadel (Military College) GED University of Central Florida Law school Education in Hong Kong National Certificate of Educational Achievement Bowl Championship Series Inflation Pitaten Appeal Single Transferable Vote Education in Germany Microeconomics Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Education in Japan Voting system University of Connecticut University of Michigan Affirmative action Dr. Michael M.

how can i go back to high school hi i live in usa maryland i came to usa when i was and i left high school when i was im about to turn and i want to go back to high school but the people in the school say i going to have to met with other people and they going to see if i can get in hight school again my question is what i going to have to say when im there and if for some reason i cant get in school again and i gona have to get a diploma going to a night school can i join the army and the other question when the classes start ohh if i go back to high school i going to go back to grade so is more years to finish high school i going to be what if i felt year what about college as u see i know i was wrong when i left high school but after my dad die weeks ago i want to c they will probably want to know why you left high school what you have been doing since you left high school why you want to re enter high school and if you will stay committed to it this time you will need to sell them on the idea that you really want to attend and that you're going to stick with it you can't attend school once you're so if you fail one year when you are you would have to go through an adult education program to get your ged or graduate equivilency diploma classes typically start in august so if you want to go back you'd better get the process started muy pronto as far as the army is concerned i think they will accept you with a ged but you would have to talk with a recruiter to be sure they used to but their policies might have changed as far as college you can enter with a ged or hs diploma but make sure you take the sat exam those scores have an affect on your placement within courses at college and most people get into college based upon the score i hope i answered everything if not you can email me with more questions and i'll try to give you more information  High school Community college Advanced Placement Program Education in Germany Education in the United States College admissions Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Australia Education in Romania IB Diploma Programme Graduate school Juris Doctor Education in Hong Kong Grade (education) Homeschooling College Law school Master's degree Education in Taiwan Education in France Education in Portugal Affirmative action Education in the Republic of Ireland National Certificate of Educational Achievement Education in Finland Numerus clausus Education in Singapore Education in Sweden Medical school Education Secondary education in France Baccalaur__at Education in Austria Ontario Academic Credit Teacher Hunter College High School No Child Left Behind Act Lynbrook High School Extreme Programming Athabasca University Nurse Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Test (student assessment) Quizbowl The Princeton Review Princeton High School, Sharonville, Ohio Adult education Florida State University Australian Qualifications Framework A-level Education in Canada Virginia Military Institute Associate's degree Secondary education in the United States Appeal Secondary education Education in Japan Standardized testing Brown University Prostate cancer Jaime Escalante Secondary education in Japan Social rule UCAS General Certificate of Secondary Education Distance education Coeducation Chiropractic Bachelor of Arts 2005 United States Grand Prix United World Colleges Physician Culture of the United States Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Avenue Q Dog agility Johns Hopkins University Pitaten U.S. presidential election, 2004 Continuing education The Citadel (Military College) Cyprus dispute Baseball Theory of conduct Miami-Dade County Public Schools Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Jeb Bush Law School Admissions Test Taipei American School Intelligent design movement One Tree Hill (TV series) University of Central Florida Scottish Qualifications Authority Public high school Franklin W.

what do you think is more interesting playing or reading explain your answer okay i'm an 'old' lady but i'm going to answer your question and you may be 'surprised' by my answer first i always have a book i'm reading as soon as i close one i put it onto my shelf and open another and start reading i was taught how to 'speed read' in the th grade and i love to be able to 'escape' this world through books i also love to 'play' and my husband and i actually 'plan' to go to 'fun places' to play on weekends since he must work during the week sometimes we go to a movie sometimes we go shopping and sometimes we just go to a park to sit and 'watch the boats go by' on the water we also like to go 'puddle jumping' yes we are 'old' but we do actually jump into puddles and we do it 'wherever there are good puddles and we often tempt others to 'jump in' too or just stand 'looking in wonder' at something or sometimes nothing just to see how many other people we can get to 'look' at what we are looking at and of course we play at home mostly 'computer games' i play wow with my husband and sometimes alone plus i have many other games word games tile matching games board games that i play as if they're 'work' to keep my brain 'active and functioning at a high level ' there's one other thing i 'do regularly' i come to y a to 'answer questions ' i'm a psychologist so many of the questions i answer from a 'professional standpoint' some i answer from something i 'did' in the past raising kids animals plants cleaning carpets professionally etc and some are like your question you may 'assume' that only 'other kids' will answer but i did and you may begin to 'realize' that no matter how 'old' you get things like 'reading' and 'playing' should be an 'important part' of your life no matter how 'old' you get because learning and doing keep you young so i may be but i'll always be 'going on '  Quizbowl Avenue Q $ale of the Century Extreme Programming Philosophy of language SAT Consciousness About a Boy Theory of conduct Yu-Gi-Oh!

does yahoo answers reflect the poor standard of literacy in the uk i find the low standards of grammar punctuation and spelling to be quite shocking is this reflective of poor standards in uk education or don't people really care that they can't express themselves adequately well thanks to a couple of people for illustrating my point being able to express yourself is not being snobbish it's a life skill i think typing mistakes are easily identified but the backward way in which some sorry i mean 'sum' people 'ppl' articulate themselves is just depressing how long does it take to type an extra letter in order to not appear to be an illiterate moron it's far worse than that i'm afraid what of the many millions of british illiterates who are not on here because they cannot read any of the questions being asked the answer may very well to have a special section for the il literati called pictures in it pictures of rude and narrow minded events can be posted for them to respond to with other rude and vulgar pictures a dead rat equals i do not agree for example a bunch of bananas up yours and so forth there is one strange piece of uk history which is often overlooked and it is simply that the majority of the workforce who forged the world's first ever industrial revolution were illiterate visit any of england's magnificent medieval cathedrals and wonder at their beauty and know they were built by illiterates common stonemasons and labourers who only knew the bible stories by looking at the stained glass windows of our cathedrals where the stories were laid out in beautiful coloured glass it just gets worse visit stone henge and know that the entire population of britain then could not only not read and write but knew nothing what so ever about such things yet somehow this mob of illiterates managed to drag ton stones through the mud and got them erected following days and weeks of drunken swearing and so forth nothing much has changed then  The Apprentice 2 American and British English differences Crossword Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Killian documents Stained glass Education in the People's Republic of China Microeconomics Gramophone record Theory of conduct Anglo-Saxon literature Russian joke History of British society A Course In Miracles Dilbert Gothic architecture Kain (Legacy of Kain) Opportunity rover The Amber Spyglass Slow Train Coming Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Floppy disk Goodness and value theory Dictionary Euphemism The Human Stain B3ta St. Julian's Tetragrammaton Wood carving Notre Dame de Paris Little Britain Chinese character Socrates Joseph Smith, Jr. A Series of Unfortunate Events Isaac Newton's early life and achievements Sin City One Tree Hill (TV series) Plame affair Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ye Shengtao Private Eye Education United States Postal Service Slashdot subculture Animal Farm Hiberno-English Milton H.

time management i'm a college student and getting tired of all these failed exams because i cannot manage my time pls give me some advice that is attainable that could help myself to have sense of responsibility and time and one more thing some advice for good study habits thanks here are some of my organization tips that helped me stay on top of things while in college by the way i went back to school at and graduated in may th with a b a communication degree tip when the semester starts write down your schedule in your daily planner keep this planner in your backpack and make it your best friend tip when you attend each of your classes and you receive your syllabus contract between you and the professor put the syllabus in the pocket of your class notes notebook by the way you need a different color notebook for each of your classes tip at the end of the day pull out your syllabus for each class attended and read through the assignment reading requirements test schedules for each class pull out your daily monthly planner and write this information into your planner by date tip at the end of every day read and organize your class notes this is so important for it is repetition and keeps the information fresh in your mind also it will be easier than you think to pass that first test when the time comes for you will only have to read over your notes a couple of times to review vs cramming at the last minute tip no read review and succeed also it is very important the first day of each class to get email addresses and contact numbers from some of your classmates why tip no because if you have holes in you notes then you will have a backup to get the information if you don't want to contact the professor directly and in case you have to miss a class once again your friends in class pick someone who is always in class will help you out but remember that you need to be return the favor when asked tip no never wait until the last minute to get started on that paper set your goals for the week tip no start researching each day use the library search engines for articles and print them out accumulate and review now this will keep you ahead of the game and your college experience will be filled with low stress and high marks trust me tip no read your notes daily tip no during class keep your planner out and add assignments as needed tip no work ahead of the schedule and you will always be prepared build relaltionships and you will be successful i am not yelling by using caps i am just reiterating the importance of time managment skills that only build good study habits i wish you success in your college experience i know you can do it and i hope these tips help they got me through and i came out with a gpa after not being in college for over years good luck  GED Grade (education) Graduate school Education in Germany Massachusetts Institute of Technology Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Romania Law school Education in Taiwan Community emergency response team Extreme Programming Columbine High School massacre The Amazing Race Volleyball Baseball CPU cache Cleveland Browns Affirmative action University of Central Florida Juris Doctor A-level Physician College admissions No Child Left Behind Act SAT Strategic management Poker jargon Education in Japan Education in the United States Brown University Franklin W.

im going to a new school this year and not sure how to get people to like me i have never changed schools before help me i have changed schools several times usually a school will assign someone to take you to your classes and that person will probably offer to let you have lunch with them if they aren't your scene you might try gravitating towards people who do seem more like you in your classes sit next to them ask their help for something or ask if you can be in their group during a project don't be too bold about your likes dislikes you don't want to put them off just be yourself but a mild version of yourself until you see what they're like once you see that you have something in common with someone you can just be yourself it's just easier not to be too out there until you're a week or so into school  Whose Line Is It Anyway?

moving before senior year of school what should i do ten points for best answer ok i've spent two years at my high school in ri and am in the top of my class i have also made many great friends however i'm almost definately moving after my junior year to ny where i will spend my senior year i have made many friends to where i might move because my family lives there and that is where i spend much of my summer however their hs doesn't have italian i'm in italian honors next year and italian eep sr year so at my new hs i won't have a language my sr yr will this affect my college opportunities will this move affect my class rank and gpa because schools weight classes differently will new high schools look at my transcript and actually weight my grades how they weight theirs or will i just not be counted in the class rank or even just moved unfairly back into like because they didn't weight it lastly will this affect my chances into colleges do they care that you move like this before your senior year thanks to answer each question separately regarding your lack of foreign language your senior year it will not affect it at all most colleges only look at th th grade academic information senior year grades are not considered because most are not posted when applications are due so don't worry about that unless you wereplanning on taking an ap italian exam your class rank could be weighted but it could be weighted in your favor it depends upon the ranking of the school system that you are transfering from versus where you are transferring to however it won't change drastically maybe one or two places in either direction colleges look at the overall picture they look at your class load grades rank and sat scores it does not make that big of a difference if you slip from th in the class to th relax and enjoy your senior year it's great that you will be familiar with your surroundings so have fun good luck  Grade (education) Education in the United States Graduate school National Certificate of Educational Achievement SAT High school New Trier High School The Citadel (Military College) Hunter College High School College admissions Advanced Placement Program GED Education in Hong Kong Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Lynbrook High School University of Central Florida Education in Taiwan Education in the People's Republic of China Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Starfleet ranks and insignia Secondary education in the United States Test (student assessment) Quizbowl Pitaten United States Academic Decathlon Social rule Trinity College, Dublin ELO rating system Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Numerus clausus Junior Certificate Go ranks and ratings Game show Azumanga Daioh American and British English differences Law school Education in Singapore Explosive material Secondary education in France Miami-Dade County Public Schools Education in Malaysia DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Chiropractic DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX British honours system Education Community college Prostate cancer Sumo Education in Australia Education in Portugal Voting system Tripartite System Car handling DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Middle Tennessee State University Jeopardy!

for med skool is it really worth goin thru years of school for me its med skool residency im asking this because of financial reasons will i be making enough money to support myself will i see my friends and classmates aready in a career before me i suppose it depends on what medical field you're pursuing but let's face it there are never any guarantee in life you can only do what you can to improve yourself to give yourself the best chances for success and does it matter if your friends have careers before you or not throughout your life you and your friends will each go through different phases of their lives if you're in school they might be working if if you're all working chances are some of you will make more money or work more hours than the other it's very doubtful that all of you will be at the same position in life at the same time i think the real question you should ask yourself is if this is something that you really want to do if you're having such serious doubts even before you even get started then you may not last the years that it takes to finish honestly ask yourself if this is something that you truly want to do before you pursue it further also keep in mind that you will likely make some money during residency even if it's not as much as being a full blown doctor so it's not exactly years without an income  Old school hip hop Graduate school Juris Doctor Annuity Single Transferable Vote Spice Girls Theory of conduct Master's degree Extreme Programming Poker jargon The nature of God in Western theology Abortion debate Blackjack Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social rule Education in the United States Jon Secada Medical school Life insurance Friedrich Schleiermacher Publicly funded medicine Medicine Insurance Money Contract Mediation Physician Avenue Q Sydney Riot of 1879 Ocean's Twelve K' Philosophical skepticism Peer review Elections in the United States Freeters Backgammon Ludwig Wittgenstein Alternative medicine Oral sex Doctorate Ben Johnson (athlete) 401(k) Professor Hyperinflation Migraine Scientology beliefs and practices Personal finance Assassination Divorce United States dollar God Emperor of Dune The Five Doctors Inflation Infantilism Placebo effect Education in Romania Student loan Master (Doctor Who) Ernie Irvan Domestic violence Bill Frist Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Wheel of Fortune Saruman Intelligent design The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Jay-Z Tax Estoppel Battle of the Bulge Steffi Graf Charles Darwin's views on religion 1919 World Series The Amazing Race New York Knicks Sant Thakar Singh Betting (poker) Jeffrey Archer, Baron Archer of Weston-super-Mare 2000 Australian Grand Prix Rudolf Hermann Lotze Pittsburgh Steelers Match Game Education in Germany Constitution of Ireland Wyatt Earp W.

broad academic subjects like philosophy politics are a waste of time education should prepare young people for work but some say broad academic subjects like philosophy and politics are a waste of time to what extent do you agree with this statement i don't agree politics isn't a waste of time but people that study it generally are philosophy is probably the only course of study that everyone would benefit from it helps one deal with basic questions like why one's work matters in the first place i'd certainly rather hire a philosophy major than a political science major i think one of the major problems in our society is that there is a deficiency in the area of philosophy it is particularly noticed in our politicians who cannot state a moral principle that they hold the closest they can come is to state one or two firmly held platform positions and a few of those more skilled in politics defend those positions adequately none of them ever seem to even conceive of the question of why this is a moral just correct or wise position it's just their position there's no principle behind it at all if more people were educated in philosophy we might recognize these intellectual lightweights for what they are and stop electing them and put them where they belong behind a fast food counter  Objectivist philosophy Philosophy of mathematics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ethics Cultural relativism Theory of conduct Western philosophy Philosophy of science Political economy Philosophy Anti-intellectualism Goodness and value theory John Rawls Social justice David Hume Atheism Morality Jewish principles of faith Bernard Williams Supernatural Falsifiability Science Philosophy of business Affirmative action Immanuel Kant Maimonides Logic Intelligent design Jean-Jacques Rousseau Peter Singer Political philosophy Leo Strauss Confucianism Metaphysics Education in the People's Republic of China Religion Homeschooling Philosophy of education Reality Public policy Victor Cousin Friedrich Schleiermacher Causality Property (ownership right) Young Earth creationism Separation of church and state Graduate school Free will Physics Rabbi Coercion Education Libertarianism Postmodernism Left-wing politics Animal rights School of Salamanca Consciousness Professor Bertrand Russell Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Wedge strategy Modern geocentrism Socrates Ernest Gellner Max Stirner Atomism Philosophy of law Jewish philosophy Politics Nicomachean Ethics Cognitive science Philosophy of history Thomas Hill Green Juris Doctor Epistemology Abortion debate Republic Appeal Rudolf Hermann Lotze Religious studies Public domain Lawyer Social sciences Rudolf Steiner Deconstruction Altruism Biblical inerrancy Mathematics Sociocultural evolution Human rights Art

how can i write a good opening for an essay without sounding cliche i am intending to study abroad in costa rica this spring but as part of my application process i have to write and essay about why i want to study abroad i have a pretty good idea what the body of my essay is going to be but not a clue how to open and close these are my weaknesses would it be too cliche to start with a good quote if i can find one please help aw thank you guys you are so helpful now i just have to get off my lazy but and write it ug i'm stuck again part of the reason i want to study abroad is b c i want to get a taste for traveling in order to prepare me for a career where i could travel but this will be hard to elaborate on considering i have no freaking idea what i am going to do after college other then travel lol my other reasons include wanting to learn spanish and wanting to learn more about costa rica it is an incredible country wow okay i'm giving you an answer idea but keep in mind it has been forever since i've written something like this you could definitely elaborate on the bilingual thing it's a very marketable skill in many big cities and then tie it into how this could only enhance your ability to be a good candidate for travel in your future job this may be broad enough so that you don't have to state exactly what you want to do but you could make that a strong point too in other words being bilingual with travel experience could get you ready for a multitude of professions and would be useful in many different fields your job opportunities could be amazing when you are writing get pumped about the thought of going your enthusiasm will start to come out in your writing and will draw your reader in hope that helped a little good luck  Spanish language Software engineering Social rule The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Calvin and Hobbes Costa Rica Theory of conduct Philosophy of language Mnemonic Multilingual Second language acquisition Franz Boas Milton H.

how long does it take to learn piano grade for somebody who is a quick learner but has no knowledge of reading music one average how long would it take lessons are like for an hour and i would love to learn to grade but i am worried about the cost d thanks in advance i think the average is a grade a year that's if you have one half hour lesson a week and you take things gradually and build up from the basics including scales theory and everything obviously it involves quite a bit of practice too i had lessons minutes a week for years and although i didn't actually take any formal grades my teacher said i was at around a grade possibly working towards a when i stopped like everyone else has said you would just have to see how it goes if you really enjoy it and practice lots i don't see why you couldn't take a couple of grades within a few years good luck p s finding a cheaper teacher could sort out the money problem my lessons were only each that was only half an hour but it would probably be worth looking around maybe even consider half hour lessons cos if you put the practice and time in at home and that is what will lead to you getting better then you only need a teacher to show you how to do something so that you can put the work in at home to show them the finished piece next week if that makes any sense sorry i've rambled on a bit  Music lesson Grade (education) Education in the United States Extreme Programming Education Sergei Prokofiev Education in Romania Second language acquisition Social rule Philosophical skepticism Graduate school Alexander Technique Lesson Propaedeutic value of Esperanto CPU design Education in the People's Republic of China Time Out of Mind Scientology beliefs and practices Erik Satie Current teachings of Prem Rawat Music Education in Hong Kong Humphrey Bogart Driver's license Piccolo Junior Saga GED Theory of conduct Carl Barks Solomon Keal Hogwarts Suzuki method 24 Hours of Le Mans No Child Left Behind Act The Fourth Way Ceroc Socrates Hey Jude Learning Japanese tea ceremony Shaggy dog story Milton H.

what are some education programs i am wanting to get some sort of education that doesn't take terribly long to get something much shorter than getting a degree preferably that would allow me to make more in the work force i know that going to learn how to do hair takes about a year but thats too long and expensive as well would getting a commercial driving license be a good idea what would be some kind of short education program that would allow me to get a better paying job even getting an associated degree would take too long at lease two years i'm thinking months or less any field other than striping haha thanks how short do you want it to be remember the easier and shorter the qualifications are to get the more there will be with those qualifications the harder it will be to get jobs in that field and the lower wages will be simple supply and demand what are you good at what do you like doing answer these questions and it will help narrow down your choices get any job in your chosen field and study part time the qualifications may take years to but they will be worth it as you progress in your studies you should be able to get promotions and your work should help you with your studies don't sell yourself short also remember that god has a plan for your life he will give you wisdom to choose the best path for you just ask him  Education in Portugal Microeconomics A-level Economics Graduate school Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in Romania Education in Australia Education in Germany Education in the People's Republic of China Supply and demand Extreme Programming Master's degree Inflation Password Education The Apprentice 2 Socrates Lawyer Coercion Education reform Paralegal Meaning of life The nature of God in Western theology Expert system Anthroposophy Nurse Medical school Labour economics Economic inequality You Don't Know Jack Law of value Efficiency wages Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Keynesian economics Affirmative action Principal-agent problem Software engineering Labor theory of value Copyright law of the United Kingdom Education in England Quizbowl Education in Finland Theodicy Good Times Education in Sweden Goodness and value theory Ra (board game) Physician GED Say's law Original sin Marius Education in the United States Rich Mullins Bologna process Supply-side economics Professor Public policy Hyperinflation Education in Hong Kong Redundant array of independent disks AmigaOS UCAS On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Quicksort Simone Weil Game programmer Teacher System/36 MP3 Economy of Russia Anchor Free will Social rule Industrial engineering BASIC programming language Land use forecasting Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mach kernel Deflation (economics) The Ashlee Simpson Show Community college Alcoholics Anonymous Predestination Apprenticeship Jewish principles of faith Church of Christ Canadian Senate Incarnations of Immortality Education in Malaysia Tax Architect Cooperative education Strap-on dildo

how do the deaf blind and mute learn to interact i saw a special on dr phil with a mother and father who had children including triplets who were deaf blind and mute the episode tugged right at my heartstrings seeing the struggle that these parents were going through with these three children the toll on their relationship and the pain of the seemingly perfectly normal older daughter who had no time or attention from her parents i can only assume that it is so hard to deal with one person who is deaf blind and mute let alone three i know all about helen keller but she was also deaf and blind but not mute the woman i discussed has three deaf blind and mute children if they don't have it now they will probably develop a very close and loving relationship between all of them when a person is deaf and blind the sense of touch is relied upon for language and expression this family will probably develop a closeness that is hard to come by in normal families probably the most well known deaf and blind person was helen keller her autobiography is wonderful you should check it out  Hearing impairment Autism Helen Keller American Sign Language Daredevil Joke Deaf culture Deafblindness Disability The Miracle Worker Aphasia Auslan Domestic violence Theodicy Asperger syndrome Friends Characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion Second language acquisition Family Deaf Adoption Ludwig Wittgenstein Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh Manually Coded English Laura Bridgman Language acquisition Cat Betting (poker) The Catcher in the Rye Ludwig van Beethoven One Tree Hill (TV series) Signing Exact English Feral child Love Henry H.

nervous about school ok i'm taking an oral communications class and i'm really not a person who is comfortable to be infront of crowds or small classes but the main reason i'm nervous is because i'm really not the skinniest person in the world actually i'm pretty chunky i have a belly and i really care about what people think about me i just get so nervous that people think of me like that and getting in front of people so they have a clear view of my faults gets me nervous is there any way i can calm down can someone tell me what i can do to just forget how people percieve me trust me everyone no matter what their body type worries about how they look in front of a crowd when you make your speeches put some emotion into it work hard on your work if you seem like you know what you're talking about other people will notice too it won't be long before they're focusing more on what you're saying than what you're wearing if you want to be calmer before your speech try doing a few meditation exercises one of them is just sitting in a chair and allowing each body part to tense up close your eyes and just allow yourself to bunch up all your body parts do this in your class or the bathroom if you don't want other people to see when you are completely tense allow each body part to relax in the same way take deep breaths while you're doing this and your body should feel really relaxed and mellow when you're done good luck  Social rule Anxiety Urinary incontinence Tai Chi Chuan Insomnia Theory of conduct Meditation Anger management Equine conformation Sento Strap-on dildo Humanist Movement Friends of the Western Buddhist Order The Ashlee Simpson Show Fecal incontinence Jon Secada Time Out of Mind Massage Lucid dreaming EastEnders Stuttering Dog training Insulin Transcendental meditation Zazen Shaggy dog story Capital punishment Milton H.

how to get my kids interested in reading by themselves we have been faithfully reading to our kids since they were infants they love being read to but when they have some idle time they still choose tv internet shows over books they have not developed an interest on picking up a book and read it on their own i wonder if anyone have any tips on how to get the kids read on their own you don't say how old your kids are but most kids in the u s see far too much tv and games if you have a tv with parental guidance chip program it not to work in certain parts of the day at any rate limit the time the tv is on for them most parents today have no control over the tv would you let your kids just disappear and come home anytime they pleased yet you let their minds be absorbed by the tv set and return when they wish i am convinced the tv is raising a generation of logicless imagination starved idiots who are totally media educated set aside some interesting good books preferably that have subjects each child is interested in tell them that there are rewards for reading the books and penalties for not reading think of some small rewards and something they have to do like pull weeds if they don't assuming you have a yard something really boring set up a chart to show what each child has read and get them in competition set goals for each child by age ask questions about what they have read later verify how well they read reading will become second nature my mother told me that if you can read you can go anywhere in the universe and understand anything the ideas above about alternately reading to them and getting them to read to you is a good idea when i grew up there wasn't much tv i am convinced that one or two programs a day are enough for kids when i was in high school i read the whole world book encyclopedia a to z you're the adult take charge  The Giver Education Carl Jung The Catcher in the Rye Theodicy Hide and Q (TNG episode) Humphrey Bogart RISC The Fairly OddParents Quizbowl GED Education in the United States Art Simone Weil Theory of conduct CPU design Autism Justification (theology) Milton H.

how do u write a paper comparing two plays i need to compare two plays that i was to read school and ultimately determine which tragic figure i sympathize with the most and why considering their personal actions affecting their destinites ne have ne advice on how i can compare plays and talk about who i sympathize with the most plz n ty death of a salesman fences what plays are you comparing did you read them since you didn't give any details on the plays this is the best i can do you need to start out your paper giving a brief summary of each play just the main points of what happened and what the main character tragic figure did explain how what these two characters did affected their lives for example if he or she killed their best friend did they spend the rest of their days regretting their decisions did they go around helping others because they felt so guilty was the person they killed evil and they became a hero that sort of thing what might have they done differently would this have changed the outcome then decide which one of those two guys girls you sympathize agree with their actions the most explain why you feel this way if tragic figure number one killed his best friend but you feel that he was justified to do so say this and explain why usually with a tragic hero they are basically good but because of some character flaw things don't work out happily for example in romeo and juliet romeo was a tragic hero he was a good person and rose above the prejudice of his family because he loved juliet but the intensity of his emotions also caused his down fall when in love he tended to jump in with out looking first so to speak specifically with juliet he did not think about what would happen to his family and friends if he chose juliet over them he was so wrapped up in his all consuming love for her that he forgot everything else then when things went horribly wrong in the end he made another rash decision and ended his life quickly because he felt that death would be better than spending life without juliet whom he thought was dead had he stopped and thought things through before taking the poison he would have discovered she was not dead but because he was tragically flawed those flaws intense emotions leading to rash decisions ultimately caused his death and the death of his lover  Romeo and Juliet Juliet Theory of conduct Pitaten Theodicy Sin City Drama Charmed One Tree Hill (TV series) Predestination Kain (Legacy of Kain) Knots Landing Tragedy Darth Vader Ranma __ characters Days of our Lives EastEnders Microeconomics Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kill Bill Socrates Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Infantilism Milton H.

do employers care if you have a minor in something on your resume i know that your major as well as your experience is what's important when job hunting but if you also have a minor does that help for instance a major in marketing and minor in communication i ask you because my mother was telling me that i shouldn't waste my time getting a minor because it's only about hours of education in that particular field of interest and that an employer doesn't care about the minor what do you think if you're experienced can you please share if you're an employer please share your view s hello i am an employer as well as the owner of an educational consulting company that does work in college admissions and counseling as an employer i believe that a minor suggests that a student made effort beyond what was required in order to learn about a subject that may be relevant in a future career as an educational advisor no education is a waste of time i completed three majors in college and did so in four years if you are truly committed to becoming the best potential job candidate i would suggest that you pursue additional education such as a minor in communications in conclusion declaring and completing a minor cannot hurt you and it may even help you secure a position one day good luck  Graduate school Plame affair Affirmative action Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Paralegal Education in the People's Republic of China Juris Doctor Divorce Lawyer Academia Economic inequality Hillary Rodham Clinton Education in Portugal Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Mach kernel Maryland General Assembly Election, 2006 Unemployment Karl Rove Extreme Programming Physician Education in Germany Third party (United States) Labour economics Equal Protection Clause Abortion debate Single Transferable Vote Consensus decision-making Community college Education in the United States Software engineering Cooperative education Gross domestic product George W.

is it better to become a registered nurse online or is it better to physically attend a college i heard that online is cheaper and faster but then i heard that you graduate not knowing what you're doing on the job from online courses i really would like to do online because i can do the work on my own time but i want a quality education i'm sure that a lot of the component could be done online if it is offered courses like biology chemistry pharmacology pathophysiology etc but i could never believe that one could become a competent nurse through an online course a huge component of nursing is done hands on and with group activities there is also the technical aspect of working with different kinds of equipment that you would not get online the networking afforded in a college is also important for your career nursing is a people profession so you have to be able to work in groups so having the clinical experience is pretty essential  Education in Portugal Medicine Nurse Education in the People's Republic of China Physical therapy Education in the United States Florida State University Chinese University of Hong Kong Harvey Mudd College Computer Dublin City University Science College Physician Georgetown University Medical Assistant American University Medical school Paramedic Midwifery Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences Community college University of Michigan Software engineering Paralegal Nursing Education in Australia Graduate school Charles William Eliot Hartwick College University of Connecticut University of S__o Paulo Bachelor of Arts Mapua Institute of Technology Education in Germany University of Alabama Overclocking Education in Singapore Chiropractic Memorial University of Newfoundland Middle Tennessee State University Uppsala University University of Central Florida The Catholic University of America Stuyvesant High School University of Hong Kong Doctorate Education in Malaysia University of Pennsylvania Psychiatric and mental health nursing Haverford College University of Santo Tomas Open access City and Guilds of London Institute Pennsylvania State University Florida A&M University Advanced Placement Program ITESM Golf Cancer Johns Hopkins University Secondary education in the United States Temple University Education in Taiwan University of Virginia Grand Valley State University Chemistry Alternative medicine Degrees of Oxford University Enterprise content management Northeastern University, Boston United States Army Simulation Law school IBM PC compatible University of Coimbra Game programmer Juris Doctor University of Hartford Education in Hong Kong Medical University of South Carolina High school York University Psychiatry Distance education AMA Computer University Ambulance Lyceum of the Philippines MMORPG Heidelberg College Naturopathic medicine University of California, Los Angeles Athabasca University University of Maryland Baltimore County Nursing home Conscription Anesthesia

will award best answer i look back with hind sight and wonder what i should do and should have done when i got out of high school i joined the army spent years in and got out because i did not like being a specialized grunt it took me years to get a job at a department store partly because i could not swallow my pride enough to want to work there or any place like it i wonder if i had not joined if it would have made any difference i would still be working at a department store i would just be higher up on the chain instead of just being a traineee i consider what i did before much harder then what i do now i wonder if i should have taken the easy way out and just got a job at a department store i could always go back in the army with a desk job mos and make the same pay and more then i make now and do less harder work all i know is i am thinking seriously about starting school for an auto body tech i just want to save a little money first i am just wondeing what path i should choose and what i have chooses should i always try to find the easy way out like some people around me don't feel guilty about not being able to swallow your pride you've done a great thing with serving our country i believe that is the biggest thing anyone could ever do in their life and to me you deserve better opportunities after serving our country all military personnel deserve better opportunities after serving our country did you learn a trade in the service did you attend a school there if auto body is your passion and you love cars and trucks then i would go for it your heart has to be in it or it won't work for you as far as the 'easy way out' per say some people love living on the edge and taking risks and sometimes unnecessary risks in life but there is nothing wrong with trying to make your life easier for yourself my gosh you have been through what i would believe to be the most intense training anyone could ever imagine being in the service so if you want to take things easier now a days with you being out of the service by all means do so you deserve it but just to make you aware that sometimes what we want out of life we do need to take some risks and not the easy way out i believe if you follow your heart in what you want to do with the rest of your life whatever career that may be you will succeed at it what ever choice you make in your life if it's the easy way out or charging through the hard stuff it doesn't make you less of a person if you take the easy way out only if that's what you truly want i like what will smith said in pursuit of happyness he said if you want something in life go get it period that movie is not only a true story and not only a great movie but it has a great message out there for everyone i think you will be just fine just choose something from your heart and go get it keep positive and open minded and you will achieve greatness good luck to you ps as a person who greatly appreciates any one who serves our country i want to thank you for taking the time to do so god bless you  Theory of conduct Social rule Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Time Out of Mind Justification (theology) Sin City Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Pitaten A Course In Miracles Summa Theologiae Capitalism Goodness and value theory Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Theodicy Procrastination Tenshinhan Alcoholics Anonymous Grand Theft Auto (game) Jon Secada Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Past teachings of Prem Rawat Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economics Scientology beliefs and practices 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sola fide Economic inequality Graduate school The Apprentice 2 Original sin Shaggy dog story Hey Jude Current teachings of Prem Rawat Meaning of life Kimi Finster John Howard Yoder Labor theory of value The Amber Spyglass Nicomachean Ethics Numerology Care Bears Microeconomics Surveillance W.

where is the difference between a grant and a scholarship financial aid falls into two categories aid that must be repaid and aid that does not need to be repaid grants are free assistance from the government that does not need to be repaid loans are financial aid that must be repaid typically six months after you leave school or drop below half time enrollment scholarships are similar to grants as they do not need to be repaid remember that you may need to obtain application material directly from the donor of the scholarship the easiest to remember is that a grant is generally money given to you as a one time offering to accomplish a specific thing and generally has no strings attached to it for example you apply for a travel grant to attend a technical conference assuming you receive the grant you would then spend the money to attend the conference and that would be the end of the money many times however if you are given grant money and your expenses are less than the grant amount you will be required to return the unused portion of the funds scholarships are generally given with the requirement that the student enroll in a particular course of study and may require certain outcomes  Student loan Education in the People's Republic of China Tertiary education fees in Australia Graduate school Bond College admissions Insurance Education in Portugal Professor Marshall Plan Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus GED Life insurance Mortgage Tuition Doctor of Philosophy Credit card Microcredit Bretton Woods system Municipal bond Annuity United Kingdom corporation tax Community college 401(k) Economy of Ghana Microeconomics Social Security (United States) Education in England Government debt Publicly funded medicine Financial endowment Stock Maumoon Abdul Gayoom Bank Trinity College, Dublin Corporation Corporate finance Gross domestic product International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement Education in New Zealand Developing countries' debt Elections in the United States Education in Hong Kong Commonwealth of Nations Economy of Pakistan Divorce Financial services Islamic banking Fulbright Program Price discrimination University of Central Florida Canadian federal election, 1993 Affirmative action British universities Debt Humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Coalition Provisional Authority British nationality law Monetary policy Law school Wealth University of Rochester Politics of Canada Status of religious freedom in Iran Taxation in the United States Finance Legal aid Culture of the United States Unemployment benefit Money supply Capitalism Rational pricing Hyperinflation Mutual fund Tax Lend-Lease A Course In Miracles Education in Romania George W.

how to overcome anxiety about highschool so lately i have been feeling very mixed emotions about entering the new school the school i am going to has a lot of 'ghetto' people and people who love to fight and are considered to be ignorant by other people thats not really the issue its just i'm nervous about my teachers i don't know if i will be able to pass because of how nervous i get when forced to work with others and now the subjects are going to be so much harder i'd like to know if someone had some advice about getting through the first few days of high school and maybe some tips you have about taking notes staying organized also i would really like my writing to be discussed more openly with myself and a teacher but i'm not to sure if i should ask for their help in editing my work and getting their view on my stories or if i should just wait until i enter college thanks in advanced rain you probably needn't worry about the other students unless you're planning to spend a lot of time with them outside of school the teachers are interested in the quality of your work and if you're there organization shouldn't be too hard get a spiral notebook for each subject and don't tear out pages for anything or anyone get a legal pad and write assignments to be handed in on it get a five subject pouch and use it to hold handouts that you get in class and to store assignments that you're going to hand in and which are handed back study on your own and in a quiet place if you can't find one let your school know this and they'll help go to every class don't miss a single one ever give your best effort in every non academic activity including gym do every problem in every homework assignment turn everything in on time that's your first priority when they tell you to do something do it if you get stuck work around the bad place and ask for help the next day be completely honest in all your dealings with teachers and others once you get a reputation as a reliable kid you'll be trusted to do more interesting things and you'll always get the benefit of the doubt never miss an opportunity to demonstrate to the authorities that you're a good kid if you get stuck doing some sort of group project make sure you do more than your share of the work you'll learn more and though others might take credit for something you've done you and they will know the truth  Education in Romania Theory of conduct Extreme Programming Education in the People's Republic of China Social rule Shaggy dog story GED Current teachings of Prem Rawat Procrastination Tai Chi Chuan Graduate school Education in Japan Philosophical skepticism Past teachings of Prem Rawat A Course In Miracles Empire Burlesque Franklin W.
