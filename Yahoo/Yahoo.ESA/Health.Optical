contacts question plz help went to my eye doctor weeks ago to get contacts i tried putting them in my eye and i couldnt get them in bcuz i wuz so o scared my eye doctor only does like hr sessions so i have to go bak the next week n then i went bak the next week and i tried again and i still couldnt get it in i have to go bak in a few days and i really wanna get them in this time i kno it takes time n everything and i have to be patient but since i've tried for hrs already im kinda discouraged i've got a lot of advice on how to put the contact lens in but i just keep blinking rite wen the contact gets close to my eye bcuz therez sumthing foreign coming into my eye any advice and any execercise to make eye muscles stronger so i can stop blinking for a lil while how long did it take u guyz to put them on i kno it takes a different amount of time for every person but i wuz just wondering cuz i hope im not the only one that's really really slow not at all believe me i was exactly like you it took me forever i had to go back to the eye doctor a lot of times before i got it its not the easiest thing ever but you will get it just try to practice getting your finger to your eye as close as possible keep doing that so youll get used to your finger close your eye you dont even have to touch your eye when putting in contacts the contact itself will and it will automatically stick just keep trying and dont give up what helped me get it was everyone told me i wouldnt be able to do it and i just wanted to prove them wrong  Jon Secada Social rule Milton H.

did i accidentally damage my eye when i removed a contact okay so i only got contacts this afternoon august as my doctor advised i removed them after hours around pm it was my first time removing my left contact as the doctor only had me remove the right one at the office anyway it took me a few minutes so my eye was a little pink with irritation but i did succeed in removing my contact however after closely looking in the mirror i noticed there seemed to be a small clear glob near my lower eyelid of my left eye this was not the case for my right eye whose contact i assume came out easier this small glob seemed to be membrane or eye discharge it didn't have a serious effect on my vision only sometimes when i blinked my vision seemed a little blurred but it'd clear on its own my left eye remained pink for less than minutes after removal and now after an hour and a half my left eye is normal did i damage my left eye should i not wear contacts tomorrow will it repair itself thanks in advance first you are a new contact lens wearer and it will take you a little while to become more comfortable many people have trouble taking the out and putting them in girls with longer nails have an especially difficult time remember to always wash your hands before handling your contacts your eyes never experienced contacts or a finger probing them before this caused the redness and even the slight drainage your doctor probably gave you some rewetting drops try putting these in now i bet when you wake up tomorrow everything will be fine tomorrow remember patience putting them in and use the rewetting drops throughout the day  Conjunctivitis Eye Diabetic retinopathy Contact lens Stereoscopy Eyeglass prescription Social rule Milton H.

i need to see a picture of a person with astigmatism i wish i can see a picture i been asking these for months lol yes honestly people with astigmatism look just like everyone else actually astigmatism is more common then you may think many people have it i have a fairly mild astigmatism but i am not sending you a picture of myself lol i assure you i look normal tho astigmatism is due to your cornea or lens inside your eye being shaped more cylindrical like a football rather then spherical like a baseball this causes the light to be focused at different points of your retina which creates blurry vision this is definitely something you cannot see with the naked eye  Astigmatism Eyeglass prescription Contact lens Eye Glasses Cornea Keratoconus LASIK Lens (optics) Intraocular lens Aberration in optical systems Eyepiece Autostereogram Myopia Diabetic retinopathy Telescope Bates Method Stereoscopy Refractive surgery Color blindness Perspective projection distortion Iris (anatomy) Presbyopia Philosophy of perception Sun Albinism Pupil Wavefront Thomas Young (scientist) Visual system Anamorphic widescreen Trilobite Depth of field Schmidt camera Eye surgery IMAX Eye examination Optical cavity Laser Visual perception Retina Visual loss Red eye (medicine) Red-eye effect Tuatara Perspective (graphical) Stage lighting Sensation Macro photography Cinematography Eye contact Photorefractive keratectomy Uvea Retinal detachment Compound eye Spatial disorientation Tocopherol Movie projector Welding Nuclear explosion Reflecting telescope Eye color Octopus Sunglasses View camera Night vision Floater Ritchey-Chr__tien telescope Photographic lens Naked eye Microscope Panavision Multiple integral Fusor Macular degeneration Coordinates (mathematics) Teleological argument Persistence of vision Homunculus History of telescopes Chalazion Single-lens reflex camera Panoramic photography Black hole LOL (Internet slang) Amblyopia Color Nystagmus Chlorpromazine Technicolor Nuclear weapon design Parallax Solar eclipse Conjunctivitis Hypertensive retinopathy Shaped charge Light

if i use the new glasses to work use the old glasses to watch tv will this way makes eyes worse because when i use the old glasses to watch tv or use computer i still can see very well no the truth is looking through a slightly weaker or stronger prescription will not cause any harm to your eyesight glasses just bend the light so you can see better and do not actually improve or worsen eyesight wearing a prescription that is slightly too strong or weak will not be correcting your vision to its full potential it will not actually cause any harm to your eyes if there was enough difference in the prescriptions you may experience eye strain when adjusting to your glasses after switching them this is not permanent and will not harm you in any way the most that will happen is that you will just not see as well when you are wearing them hope this helps a bit  Glasses Myopia Eyeglass prescription Stereoscopy Presbyopia Sunglasses ELO rating system Visual perception Eyepiece Contact lens Aberration in optical systems Autostereogram Light Illegal drug trade Keratoconus Clinical depression Amblyopia Glass Cannabis (drug) Bates Method Computer animation Fiberglass Electrophysiology Theory of conduct Violin Urinary incontinence Multiple sclerosis Modem Psoriasis Chronic fatigue syndrome Tests of general relativity Tenshinhan Mental illness Anaglyph image Characters in the Smurfs Acne Equine conformation History of telescopes Inflation Dyslexia Speed of light Social rule Rum Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Safety engineering Infantilism Ethernet Vegeta Optical fiber Hormone replacement therapy (trans) E85 Sun Weight training Single Transferable Vote Free trade Stereopsis Laser Acetazolamide X-ray Spider Fecal incontinence LASIK Goggles Childbirth Motif of harmful sensation Homeopathy Color Parallax Methamphetamine Screenplay Breastfeeding Growth hormone treatment Compact disc Repetitive strain injury M16 (rifle) Photographic lens Gravity Cat Publicly funded medicine Scientific method Shen Gong Wu Diabetes mellitus English grammar Stuttering Prostate cancer Headlight Aldous Huxley Hatake Kakashi Glass cockpit George W.

how can i change my eye color i just wanted to know if i can change my eye color without using contacts my eyes are brown right now and i want them to be green please can you tell me how to do so please help no there is nothing you can do to change your eye color some medications illnesses and hormones are known to change eye color by changing the amount distribution of melanin on the iris causing the light to reflect a different color these factors cannot be controlled to intentionally change the color of your eyes for a desired color if you have lighter brown eyes you could try changing the color of your makeup and clothing to make your eyes appear slightly different shades you will need color contact lenses for a drastic change of eye color there is an iris implant surgery but it is very risky and impractical due to the inability for dilation constriction of the pupil it is also not approved in the usa and done in another country so i personally do not even see that as a viable option i always think a person's natural eye color suites them best otherwise you could try some opaque color contact lenses  Iris (anatomy) Intraocular lens Heterochromia Contact lens Hair color Pupil Sunglasses Eye Human skin color Eye contact Color Stereoscopy Red-eye effect Abortion Melanin Ultraviolet Albinism Binoculars Cornea Medicine Eyepiece Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sunscreen Technicolor Uvea Hypoglycemia Glass Stage lighting Glaucoma Red hair Eye examination Light-emitting diode Transsexuality Enlarger Color blindness Cat coat genetics Diabetic retinopathy Lighting Ray tracing Sun Iridology Rainbow Color theory Glasses DLP Camouflage Polarization Street light Urinary incontinence LASIK Dragon Booster Traumatic brain injury Cornea transplant Eyeglass prescription Macular degeneration Headlight Diamond Homosexuality and transgender Refractive surgery Epilepsy Cat Common cold Nuclear weapon design Aberration in optical systems Chronic fatigue syndrome Diabetes mellitus Telescope Prostate cancer Digital photography Primary color Billiards Tocopherol Atari 8-bit family Gravitational lens Conjunctivitis Consensus decision-making Chameleon Epinephrine Transgender Visual system Parallax Bicycle lighting Game Boy Legal aspects of transsexualism Meriones unguiculatus Oculomotor nerve Insulin Clinical depression Drowning Green Anaglyph image Lightsaber Gamut Scrubs Puberty Radiation therapy Dog Titanium

eye problem for the past several weeks my eyes have been getting red on and off i wear contacts and the redness occurs after i wear my contacts for several days i take them out at night i don't wear my contacts while my eyes are red and ive tried changing them but that is not the problem my eyes get irrated it feels like something is in them they sometimes get watery and sometimes they are a little sensitive to light at the beginning of the summer had an abrhasion in my right eye and my doctor gave me eye drops systane at first i thought the abrhasion never healed all the way but it keeps happening the drops seem to help with the pain but i wanted to know if anyone knew what was happening before i go to the eye doctor again oh yea ive been away at college so it may have to do with the change of scenery please if anyone has any help i would greatly appreciate it thanks the abrasion isn't healing probably because the lens won't allow for sufficient oxygen or to get to the epithelium long enough to replace the basement membrane this membrane can be damaged with an abrasion the epithelial cells will grow over the wound but without the basement membrane to adhere to they can get bumped off fairly easily you might try not wearing your lenses for about weeks this'll give your corneas enough time to heal sort of get back to normal then try your lenses again you might also have a sensitivity to the solutions you use for your lenses or something in them a preservative cleaning solution make sure that if you do have an abrasion that it's a simple abrasion and not an infection i think the eyes have control of us here have you noticed how many questions are about contacts if eyes took a vote would they allow contacts at all both my eyes said no thanks but i've thousands of patients who's eyes say no big thing when they complain listen  Contact lens Cornea Wound healing phases Eye Conjunctivitis Iris (anatomy) Epithelium Stomach cancer Diabetic retinopathy Refractive surgery Intraocular lens Diabetes mellitus Healing Photorefractive keratectomy Gonorrhoea Social rule Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Psoriasis Radiation therapy Sun Insulin Bruise Milton H.

can you swim with contacts in your eyes not only can your contact lenses could get flushed out of your eyes but they also can get contaminated water is known to contain bacteria and microbes that can attach themselves to the contact lenses and infect your eyes one of these would be acanthamoeba and this amoeba causes a very bad eye infection that is hard to treat and can lead to loss of vision if you can avoid wearing your contact lenses while swimming then it would be best to do so unless you have very poor vision without your contact lenses then it would be best to avoid the risk of contamination and not wear your contact lenses for swimming you could always try goggles over the contact lenses prescription goggles daily disposable contact lenses that you throw away after swimming or go without any correction while swimming anyways good luck  Contact lens Acanthamoeba Diving Body piercing Intraocular lens Foodborne illness Eyeglass prescription Keratoconus Escherichia coli O157:H7 Eye Presbyopia Bacteria Swimming Sunglasses LASIK Protective clothing Optometry Conjunctivitis Gonorrhoea Frogman Common cold Swimming pool Amblyopia Diabetic retinopathy Sewage treatment Diplopia Myopia Herpes simplex virus Halitosis Eyepiece Refractive surgery Water purification Tuberculosis Stereoscopy Sexually-transmitted infection Hygiene Entamoeba histolytica Leptospirosis Psoriasis Drowning Disinfection Toxoplasmosis Tampon Cornea Legionellosis Acne Eye contact Dysentery Wound Hip fracture Group A streptococcal infection Biological warfare Methamphetamine Hard disk Survival skills Menstrual cup Floater Ringworm Dialysis Dog Tocopherol Lens (optics) Iris (anatomy) Ascariasis Photorefractive keratectomy Agar plate Echovirus Computer virus Transmission (medicine) Diarrhea Japanese toilet Use of poison gas in World War I Multiple sclerosis Lyme disease Louis Pasteur Cheating in poker Myxobolus cerebralis Tattoo Medical prescription Vulvovaginal health Bicycle lighting IMAX Dairy Sulfuric acid Intravenous therapy Cryptosporidium Egg (food) Ultraviolet Intestinal parasite Combine (Half-Life 2) AIDS Antiseptic Photographic lens Hyperbaric oxygen therapy Tire Aberration in optical systems

eyes sensitive to light i was at a hours concert last night and now my eyes are very sensitive to light i'm sitting with the lights off now all the electrical stimualtion of being at a concert makes your brain more sensitive to light as well as being confined to a darker than normal area for so long your eyes were for accustomed to the low low lighting and the brighter flashes of light from the concert so now you are having to re adjust to the normal light source which is way way more than what your eyes were previously accustomed to relax give your eyes and your brain time to heal stay out of the bright lights and gradually add more light into your day and see if the sensitivity eases up if it's still bad after days go to the eye doctor to make sure you havent permanently damaged your retinas  Color blindness Eye Color Sun Diabetic retinopathy Bicycle lighting Retina Night vision Light-emitting diode Pupil Incandescent light bulb Ultraviolet Chlorpromazine Explosive material Street light Solar eclipse Transformer Electroencephalography Cat Fluoroscopy Autostereogram Extraterrestrial skies Sleep Radiation hardening Fluorescent lamp Light Urinary incontinence Nuclear explosion Sento Retinal detachment Apparent magnitude Tuatara Tocopherol Loudspeaker Binocular rivalry Magnetic resonance imaging Laser applications Insomnia CIE 1931 color space Color vision Glasses Eye color Red dot sight Seismometer Insulin Red-eye effect Welding Lighting Mercury Atlas 6 X-ray Albinism Clinical depression Hearing impairment Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chronic fatigue syndrome Radiation therapy Stereoscopy Solar cell Eyeglass prescription Gamma ray burst Out-of-body experience Philosophy of perception Decibel Milton H.

how much does diameter affect contact lens size i'm trying to buy contacts cheaper online here because the price of buying them from my doctor is getting crazy the size where it says diamater is while the ones online are only available in but all the other measurments and prescriptions add up will this be a big problem or could i still wear them the doctor wrote you a prescription for a specific diameter because it does matter what the diameter is if you change the diameter by increasing it and having the other parameters like base curve the same you are actually changing the fit of the lens increasing diameter will create a looser fitting lens and this could cause issues with the fit causing discomfort and problems with visual acuity an improper fitting lens can actually cause damage to your cornea even though everything feels fine this is why contact lenses need to be fit and monitored by an eye doctor the prescription your eye doctor wrote was for the exact same contact lenses you were fit with online contact lens dealers will actually verify the prescription with your eye doctor so even if you did get away with ordering contact lenses with a different diameter you would probably be wasting your money because it is likely they will not fit properly if you want to order contact lenses online then you will need to find the exact same contact lenses your prescription was written for hope this helps a bit  Contact lens Eye Eyeglass prescription Keratoconus Eyepiece Glasses Binoculars Optometry LASIK Nuclear weapon design Medical prescription Digital photography Intraocular lens Cornea Equine conformation Gas metal arc welding Microeconomics Publicly funded medicine Diabetic retinopathy Rabies Pharmaceutical company Screw Internal ballistics Fecal incontinence Contract Dictionary Illegal drug trade Telescope Autostereogram Parallax Laser Tire Loudspeaker Psoriasis Methamphetamine Prolactinoma Tocopherol Dark matter Food and Drug Administration Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Gravitational lens Drill bit Snellen chart Amblyopia Phishing Anamorphic widescreen Curve fitting Genetic algorithm Depth of field Inflation Sun RFID Hipparchus (astronomer) Movie projector Modified Newtonian dynamics Photorefractive keratectomy Aberration in optical systems Bicycle The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Eye contact M16 (rifle) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Car handling Sunglasses Allergy Supply and demand Big Bang Autism Action potential Electrophysiology Explosive material Astigmatism United States dollar Refractive surgery Hat Gramophone record Growth hormone treatment Billiards Aperture Color Pi Isaac Newton's early life and achievements Reflecting telescope Extrasolar planet Canadian and American health care systems compared General relativity Prostate cancer Overclocking Torpedo Health insurance Star Wars: Galaxies Cartridge (firearms) Strategic management Price equation

can eye cataracts be removed naturally and without surgery no cataracts are natural after about age when you eyes reach their full adult size you start developing cataracts it's the proteins in your body that build up on the lens of the eye the important part is where on the eye they develop if it's at the edge it's fine the closer to the edge the better at the cataracts are microscopic how fast they develop depends mostly on genetics the only way to remove the cataract is with surgery they replace the cloudy lens with an artificial clear one once you have a cataract removed you'll never develop another one in that eye  Cataract Eye surgery Intraocular lens Tocopherol Microscopy Ultraviolet Eye Cancer Neurofibromatosis type II Suture Parallax Amblyopia Contact lens Myopia Harold Ridley (ophthalmologist) Retinal detachment Androgen insensitivity syndrome Glaucoma Stereoscopy Iris (anatomy) Prostate cancer Glasses Refractive surgery Diabetes mellitus Stomach cancer Eyeglass prescription Cell (biology) Soft tissue sarcoma Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Eyepiece Dog Diabetic retinopathy Nystagmus Cornea transplant Transport in Sudan Pneumonia Colorectal cancer Tooth enamel Angular resolution Headlight Diseases of the honeybee Antarctic krill Mesothelioma Malignant melanoma LASIK Microscope Floater Scar Iritis Insulin Leica Multiple sclerosis Organ transplant Acromegaly View camera Malaria Photographic lens Sunglasses Biological pest control Fasting Dialysis Protein Lung cancer Diamond enhancement Wound healing phases Cirrhosis Blood Carbachol Autostereogram Telescope Fancy rat Brewery Polymethyl methacrylate Drill bit Penis Cephalic disorder Trilobite Strabismus Stroke Prolactinoma Knife Saccade Species Nuclear fallout Ray tracing Blindness Macro photography Breast cancer Senescence Arthropod Confocal laser scanning microscopy Liver Scientific revolution Animal Chromosome Cat Francis Crick

why do people say cross eyed people make them uncomfortable i have crossed eyes the eye i'm not using will always cross inward some people say they never know what i'm looking at and eye contact is uncomfortable is this true i would think people would focus on the eye that is looking at them if i'm talking to you why would you focus on the eye that is looking at my nose i can't help my eye condition so work with me you know my girlfriend's sister has one lazy eye i know that when i talk to her i switch between both eyes to look at it is a little odd at first to get used to but only because it is different than most can truly understand but with the idea that people would focus on the one that is looking at them not always true i know that i personally can never remember which eye is the straight eye and which one is crossed wrong but when i think the eye that is looking away is the good one that makes eye contact uncomfortable after a while because i feel like im talking to some who doesnt care about what i have to say but then i see the other eye looking at me again trained myself to switch between then i feel better and no longer have the uneasy feelings some people just take longer to adjust than others  Social rule Theory of conduct Sunglasses Stereoscopy Ethics Human sexual behavior Milton H.

if your vision is in one eye and in the other is that bad enough to require glasses i took my son in for his well baby check up today in which the nurse did a vision and hearing test on him and it came back he failed both i know she isn't an eye doctor and i don't wear glasses so i don't really know anything about what those numbers mean i mean i never see him squinting or anything i don't have vision insurance or an additional bucks laying around is why i am asking i am taking him to a ear nose and throat specalist covered by insurance to have his hearing tested thanks i forgot to add that he is years old if there is a correct optical in your neighborhood i suggest going there to check his eyes out the eye exam is given by a licensed optometrist and it's only then if you choose to buy his glasses there it's only that includes frames lenses and fitting that's where i used to go to get my glasses when i didn't have insurance is ridiculous if he's starting kindergarten this year you may find that the school will give an eye exam i seem to remember the school doing that for my son if he needs glasses the school will tell you if money is an issue you can tell them that then and usually schools have a family resource center that can help out families in need of something the school might pay for your son's glasses at any rate you should get it checked out if his vision is bad it's liable to only get worse when he starts school correct optical might be spelled with a k korrect optical something like that  Glasses Eyeglass prescription Optometry Pitaten Stereoscopy Education in Germany Sunglasses Insurance Medical prescription Contact lens Health insurance Movie projector Ophthalmology Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Shining (film) Prostate cancer Physical examination Intraocular lens Medicine Eyepiece Cable television Eye Myopia Stomach cancer Graduate school Annuity Driver's license Publicly funded medicine Education in Romania Actuary Blackjack Poker jargon Life insurance Unemployment Friends GED German car number plates Education in Portugal Compact disc EastEnders The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Physician Humphrey Bogart Automatic number plate recognition Lawyer Keratoconus Milton H.

how to protect and rest your eyes from the computer i have a job over summer that requires me to sit in front of the computer for most of the day i'd say at least six hours or more the problem is my eyes get really weary and tired after a few hours and i've noticed my eyes are getting really bad again i've lived with computers around me all my life so as you can imagine my eyes are really bad i didn't care about it until a few years ago when objects ft away were starting to get very blurry so how do you protect and rest your eyes so they don't get any worse my eyes are pretty red right now x x best answer will be rewarded o thanks computer related eye strain is a familiar workplace complaint as many of the employees spend their full shifts in front of a computer without any break in addition to rooting eye strain that could lead to squinting dry eyes and other common discomfort prolonged periods in front of a computer could as well lead to other physical stresses if the surroundings is not ergonomically arranged always set up your workspace to guard your eyes along with the rest of the body as it would keep you improved and more productive there are a number of steps you could take to look after your eyes so that you would not feel stressed and tired when you arrive home after work to begin with ensure that your workspace is set in a way that would care for your eyes the ambient light level need be low and dim with no glare keep windows to the side of you other than straight ahead or behind to reduce glare also alter the brightness of your computer screen to look after your eyes your screen's lighting need to match the common light level in the room without being too bright or even too dim during the working day care for your eyes by viewing away from the computer screen to a far away point just about every minutes every half hour you need to take a full break walking away from the computer to walk and stretch yourself this would take care for your eyes and your body stop you from slumping into poor bearing that might lead to back pain and recurring stress injury make sure to blink often and use fake tears or eye drops if your eyes start to feel dry you should as well look after your eyes by getting an annual eye exam if you work with computers for full time during the test an optometrist could check on the health of your eyes and talk with you about ways to look after your eyes at work you might for example require a special glasses prescription for computer work an annual eye exam would also catch any serious troubles with your optical health early found that online hope it helps good luck  Equine conformation Eye Prostate cancer 2000 Australian Grand Prix Stomach cancer Bicycle lighting Light pollution Headlight Volleyball Fecal incontinence Diabetes mellitus Mouse (computing) Stereoscopy Carpal tunnel syndrome Shaggy dog story Weight training Glasses Psoriasis Repetitive strain injury The Contender (television series) Social rule Poker jargon Sun Urinary incontinence The Amber Spyglass Milton H.

can wearing glasses weaken the eye's colour i've been wearing increasingly stronger glasses for short sightedness every day since i was about years old i'm now nearly since that time it seems that the original colour of my eyes a very bright and even dark brown has been watered down into a murk of grey green and light brown so i would like to know whether this is simply a getting old thing or if there could actually be some connection with full time spectacle wearing your eyes can change color slightly with the seasons sometimes and even with different moods but not drastically over time the pigment in your eyes may fade abit and not be quite as bright this has nothing to do with wearing glasses it's just a time thing besides even if it did make a difference would you rather have bright eyes and be blind or a bit more dull eyes and be able to see hope this helps  Color Sunglasses Color blindness Eye color Eye Glasses Dragon Booster Stereoscopy Parallax Iris (anatomy) Retina Camouflage Red hair Color vision Beret Collectibles in Bionicle Black Green Hair color Staining (biology) Fluorescent lamp CIE 1931 color space Anaglyph image Rainbow Light-emitting diode Bicycle lighting Primary color Light Horse Visual perception Dallas Cowboys Extraterrestrial skies Snooker Concepts in the Wheel of Time series Kimono RGB color model Sonic the Hedgehog Liturgical colours Sun Pigment Filter (optics) Heterochromia Phelsuma Unreal Green Lantern Diamond enhancement Circuit design Eye contact Eyepiece Cheetah Resistor Tenshinhan Albinism Color space Happy Tree Friends Tour de France Human skin color CMYK color model Astronomy on Mars Traffic light Cosmetics Social rule Lighting Apparent magnitude Eyeglass prescription Men in Black Glass Television Stage lighting New York Giants Pixel Turquoise Grey Book of Isaiah Peafowl Vortigaunt Pleiades (star cluster) Modem Microscopy Customs and etiquette of Japan History of telescopes Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Characters in the Smurfs Ultraviolet Siberian Husky Melanin Vegeta Dalek variants Comet Hyakutake Comet Shen Gong Wu Color depth Liquid crystal display Wood Thief (computer game) Scrubs Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Cat coat genetics Incandescent light bulb

contact lenses i'm i have tried contact lenses but have had to stop because in the middle of the day they get blurry and i can't see through them at all if i move them around back where they're supposed to be then i can see again i have heard that there's a special lens made for astigmatism i have astigmatism has anybody tried these and do they work sounds like the lenses don't fit your eye properly they are probably slipping to cause the blurring as you say that when you shift them back you can see again you may have to try a few before you find a good fit just tell your optician about the problems you are having and he should test you out on a few i had to try about different types of lenses and only ended up with a really rare type at the end of it but yes astigmatism means you have to have 'toric' lenses specially designed for the shape of your eye or as has happened here they will move in your eye  Contact lens Eyeglass prescription Astigmatism Glasses Aberration in optical systems Eye Lens (optics) Eyepiece Myopia Intraocular lens LASIK Keratoconus View camera Nuclear weapon design Diabetic retinopathy Cornea Telescope Presbyopia Optometry Anamorphic widescreen Stereoscopy History of telescopes Sunglasses Movie projector Leica Strap-on dildo Macro photography Screw Autostereogram Bates Method Microscope Canon EF lens mount Social rule Blur Stage lighting Equine conformation Cinematography Binoculars Contax Ophthalmology Amblyopia Snake Big Bang Canon T90 Eye contact Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Color blindness Len Hutton Volleyball Automatic number plate recognition Solar eclipse Violin Compound eye Condom Albinism Carl Zeiss Digital camera Parallax Diabetes mellitus Digital photography Shaped charge Railway signal Nystagmus Eye surgery Conjunctivitis Panavision Depth of field Saccade Hearing aid Trilobite Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Zoom lens Operation Market Garden Schmidt camera Computer virus Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Milton H.

are there any eye excercises to keep double vision from developing do you have double vision now it would be very unusual for double vision to develop if you don't already get it sometimes there are exercises for some cases or you might need prism in your glasses the exercises to be done depend on what kind of double vision you have your eye doctor will instruct you in the right kind for you if you need them other causes of double vision include diabetes stroke and brain tumour if you suddenly develop double vision you should go to the hospital asap  Stroke Diabetes mellitus Eyeglass prescription Diplopia Brain tumor Strabismus Stereoscopy Amblyopia Urinary incontinence Cephalic disorder Diabetic retinopathy Hypoglycemia Aphasia Hypertension Traumatic brain injury Computer vision Color Atherosclerosis Medicare (Canada) Diabetic neuropathy Balance disorder Binocular vision Stereopsis X-ray Radiation therapy Colorectal cancer Autostereogram Medicine Syringomyelia Retina Addiction Blindness Epilepsy National Institutes of Health Visual perception Light Nystagmus Orthoptics Philip K.

does watching tv increase your eye perscription and playing the computer myth i keep on hearing the eye doctor tell me not not watch tv or computer to much or my eye sight is going to go bad faster but my friends who have glasses play hte computer nonstop and thier eye perscription is still fine is this a myth oh and once i saw in a ad that said that it doesn't make your eye perscription go up ahh this is bugging me lol points to the first person with a true medical awnser true medical awnser points there is no evidence that sitting close to the television will damage your eyes if this were true office workers that sit hours a day inches from their computer screens would all be blind sit wherever you are most comfortable when watching tv http www main com charlief vi myths html watching a television or computer screen does put strain on your eyes and can cause them to feel dry irritated and tired these effects are temporary and with resting your eyes and artificial tears these symptoms can be improved there is no permanent damage caused to your eyesight by tv computer use many people have the misconception that these activities cause vision to worsen i think that is because it is normal for vision to change over time and many people try to blame it on watching screens too much the truth if your vision changes it would happen regardless of how you are using your eyes  Prostate cancer Diabetes mellitus Urinary incontinence Psoriasis Stereoscopy Traumatic brain injury Chronic fatigue syndrome Blindness Fecal incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Eye Stuttering Diabetic retinopathy Radiation therapy Autism Milton H.

i have recently got contacts for the first time eyes have adjusted but they are very dry any suggestions i have toric contacts for astigmatism i did give my eyes the proper time to adjust to the contacts in air conditioning they seem to get very dry very easy tried visine drops for contacts that only seems to help for like minutes help i love the contacts and want to wear them but it is kind of uncomfortable try getting a different solution if it is the generic store brand then that could hurt your eyes or are you wearing them too long you may need to cut the hours that you wear them also talk to your eye doctor about it he she will know better than any of us so make an appointment you may need a different brand of contacts im sure you don't have to say goodbye to your contacts just yet  Contact lens Social rule Glasses Mattress Eyeglass prescription Menstrual cup Intraocular lens Aberration in optical systems Tire Fecal incontinence Theory of conduct Jon Secada Motorcycle Japanese toilet Keratoconus Myopia Diving suit Sunglasses The Shining (film) Astigmatism Electrophysiology Gas metal arc welding Condom Carpal tunnel syndrome Carburetor Carbon dioxide Hard disk Hydrogen chloride Urinary incontinence Naval mine The Curse of Fenric Smoke-screen Time Out of Mind Kitesurfing Archery Conjunctivitis Keynesian economics Diabetic retinopathy Paragliding Eczema Traumatic incident reduction Breastfeeding Sanitary towel IPod Instant coffee Domain Name System The Amazing Race The Ashlee Simpson Show Friction PlayStation 3 Prostate cancer Table saw Gramophone record Fire fighting Have I Got News For You Welding Equine conformation Sailing Dishwasher Circuit breaker Cyclops (comics) Papa's Got a Brand New Badge LASIK Punt (boat) Sleep apnea Eyepiece Bon Jovi Cornea Air traffic controller Pitaten Volleyball Inflation Cliff Richard Strap-on dildo Eye W.I.T.C.H.

my eye doctor wouldn't let me get contacts before glasses is that common practice i had my first eye exam yesterday and the doctor insisted i had to have glasses before contacts so i went ahead and ordered glasses however i am almost positive i will want contacts and i feel like i just wasted on glasses i will hardly wear in the future was he right do i need to adjust to glasses before i can get contacts he told me i could come back in a few weeks after having glasses if i wanted to get contacts fitted does that literally mean weeks or do i have to wait a certain amount of time i don't have my exact prescription in front of me but my left eye is astigmatic and my right is not and only needs very slight correction and i need the correction for distance the glasses i ordered are only for powers of or if that helps thanks everyone first of all it is not bull your doctor may have had a very good reason for putting you in glasses first if you have a high prescription and have never worn glasses or contacts before he may need to change the prescription depending on how well you adjust to it also when you wear contacts you have to have glasses to wear when you can't wear your contacts contrarily to popular belief you can not wear contacts all the time you have to give your eyes a rest as far as going back for the fitting give yourself at least two weeks to adjust to your new glasses once you feel comfortable with the prescription go back for the contact lens fitting hope this helped  Eyeglass prescription Glasses Lens (optics) Eyepiece Aberration in optical systems Contact lens Eye View camera Presbyopia Myopia Intraocular lens Binoculars Keratoconus Car handling Marching band Equine conformation Dog agility Theory of conduct Medical prescription Japanese tea ceremony Electrophysiology LASIK Motorcycle Optometry Lighting Tire Prostate cancer Rei Ayanami Bicycle Daylight saving time Photographic lens Stage lighting Weight training Gas metal arc welding Parallax Fecal incontinence Ocean's Twelve Bicycle lighting Naval mine Headlight Carburetor Publication of Darwin's theory Strategic management Archery Menstrual cup Transformer Japanese toilet The Ashlee Simpson Show President (game) Enlarger Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Solar cell Astigmatism Aikido Circuit design Rum Sailing Wind turbine Hal Trosky Beetle in an Anthill Charles Darwin's education Internal ballistics Telescope Isaac Newton's early life and achievements The Amazing Race The Contender (television series) Snooker Spacecraft propulsion Volleyball English grammar The Shining (film) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Jumpstart 3rd Grade John Sheridan (Babylon 5) The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Publicly funded medicine Table saw Incandescent light bulb Jeopardy!

polarized sunglasses i bought a pair of glasses that has a polarized sun glasses clip on in other words i just wear my glasses and the put the magnetic clip on over the glasses to have shades since i got this pair of glasses from an eye care center could i assume that the polarized clip on provides good uv protection i didn't think about it when i was buying my glasses because i assumed i could trust that any kind of shades would have good uv protection if i bought them from an eye care center that has about associated optometrists with doctorate degrees yes the polarized lenses are great for blocking glare and providing uv protection for your eyes the only downside to a magnet sun clip on your glasses is that they do not provide as good of coverage and side protection as conventional sunglasses and the light can still get in the sides which means a bit of uv can still get to your eyes etc if you ever doubt the amount of uv protection your lenses are providing many opticals have uv meters that can test the amount of uv that will transmit through your lenses you should ask your local eye care center about it hope this helps  Sunglasses Glasses Eyeglass prescription Stereoscopy Polarization Optometry Light Sun Ultraviolet Parallax Microscope Eye Optical fiber Filter (optics) Headlight Binoculars Lens (optics) Telescope Isaac Newton's early life and achievements Aberration in optical systems IMAX Antenna (radio) Glass Contact lens Eyepiece Light-emitting diode Movie projector Microscopy Ophthalmology Uses of trigonometry Solar eclipse Solar power Dark matter Gamma ray burst Seismometer View camera Lighting Upholstery Federal Standard 1037C Medical prescription Optical coating Aurora (astronomy) Gas metal arc welding Electric motor Moon Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Mirror Rainbow Shielded metal arc welding Lunar Prospector History of telescopes Modem Sunlight Polarizer Gravity Microphone Observational astronomy Autostereogram Anaglyph image Diabetic retinopathy Optics Photographic lens Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Depth of field Polymethyl methacrylate Medicine Universal Serial Bus Bicycle lighting Surveyor 7 Diabetes mellitus Stage lighting Sunspot Terraforming Iris (anatomy) Diving suit Camera Haidinger's brush Rayleigh scattering Solar cell Digital Sensor Goggles DualDisc Surveillance Nystagmus Macro photography Contax Ionosphere Life insurance Internal ballistics Clementine mission Magnetic core memory Lunar Orbiter program Compound eye Cassini-Huygens Cathode ray tube Solar sail Polar Bear 3-D film Solar panel

i've had a stye chalazion on my eye for months now the eye doctor advised me to use a warm compresses and said that it would go away by using that simple treatment however that was six months ago and the stye chalazion is just as hard and visible on my upper eyelid as it was months ago has this happened to you will i have to get it surgically removed what is that procedure like you will likely have to have an in office surgery they will numb you which is the most painful part of the procedure otherwise they clean out the chalazion and the whole procedure takes about minutes you will probably have to use an antibiotic topical cream for a few days but it is really a very simple procedure  Dialysis Acne Surgery Chalazion Prostate cancer Cornea transplant Diabetic retinopathy Eyelid Conjunctivitis Rosacea Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Bone fracture Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Intraocular lens Needle aspiration biopsy Stomach cancer Medicine Plastic surgery Face Hemorrhoid Triage First aid Eye surgery Endometriosis Cellulitis Penis Phimosis Abscess Local anesthesia Medical analysis of circumcision Colorectal cancer Syringomyelia Lethal injection Chronic fatigue syndrome Traumatic brain injury Fecal incontinence Psoriasis Epilepsy Cholecystitis Cancer Common cold Childbirth Mouth ulcer Atherosclerosis Intersex surgery Carpal tunnel syndrome Eczema Malignant melanoma Cystoscopy LASIK Anesthesia Cocaine Female genital cutting Refractive surgery Adjustable gastric band Circumcision Genital wart Cluster headache Trigeminal neuralgia Massage Urinary incontinence Sleep apnea Castration Renal cell carcinoma Lyme disease Breast cancer Neurofibromatosis type II Breastfeeding Blepharitis Traditional Chinese medicine Stroke Body modification Psychosurgery Medicare (Canada) Oncology Suture Acromegaly Folic acid Sterilization (microbiology) Cholecystectomy Aneurysm Obstetrics Spina bifida Animal testing Dermatology Air embolism Acoustic neuroma Mastoiditis Cervical cancer Brachial plexus Appendicitis History of male circumcision Abdominal surgery Hidradenitis suppurativa Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Migraine Nitrous oxide Endocarditis Epidural

farsighted and nearsighted i am almost and i have a farsighted eye and a nearsighted eye i hate the way my eyes look in glasses one of my eyes is magnified and the other looks shrunk my prescription right sphere cylinder axis left sphere cylinder axis i know that i am not yet and my eyes will keep changing up to a certain age however i want to know how high my sphere numbers could get in my eyes before they level off maximum possible estimate considering that my eyes will get worse with time just because of age until they finally level off i'm assuming that nothing weird would happen to my eyes like i would get cataracts i'm afraid that before my eyes level off i might get to the point where i'll be wear a lens in my left eye and a some number lens in the other eye and i will look like a total weirdo in glasses would wearing contacts help to minimize the difference in my eye sizes as they are perceived also i know that nearsightedness gets worse with time does farsightedness get more extreme with time i mean when you are a kid not when you get prebyopia as an adult i ask because my left i used to be slightly farsighted when i was probably as a result of my right eye being lazy before it was corrected but then it went nearsighted with time so i figured that farsightedness lessens with time in normal circumstances i cetainly don't want my farsighted eye prescription to go up in magnitude to like a or anything then i would really look like a freak if i were wearing like a sphere in one eye and a in the other eye actually i know that the sphere of means that i am nearsighted in my left eye first of all your at an age where your eyes are almost stabilized meaning you may have some slight changes but not major this is the norm anyway contact lenses would certainly be ideal for you as they will not make your eyes look any different however if you have a lazy eye the dr may have prescribed prism in your lenses that cannot be corrected with contact lenses do you see anything on your prescription that has a triangle with a number and arrrow beside it if not i would definitely discuss getting contact lenses with the dr some advantages of getting contacts if you are a candidate that is are aesthetically your eyes will appear the same better overall vision less change in your rx overtime as the contacts do not allow for as much change in the shape of the eye  Eyeglass prescription Glasses Myopia Lens (optics) Strabismus Aberration in optical systems Stereoscopy Eye Intraocular lens View camera Amblyopia Sunglasses Headlight Hipparchus (astronomer) Photographic lens Keratoconus Perspective projection distortion Autostereogram Light Map projection Loudspeaker ELO rating system Carburetor History of telescopes Amateur telescope making Archimedes Geodesy Digital photography Electrophysiology Explosive material Collision detection Refractive surgery Presbyopia Perspective (graphical) Movie projector Chromatic aberration LASIK Orthogonal matrix Equine conformation Dimension Diabetic retinopathy Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Polarization Complex number Car handling Isaac Newton's early life and achievements Eye contact Shen Gong Wu Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Motor oil Phonograph cylinder Stuttering Phase-shift keying Laser engraving Telescope Tocopherol Point groups in three dimensions Color blindness Monocle Sphere Diplopia Circuit design E85 Nystagmus Sundial Photorefractive keratectomy Bloodstain pattern analysis Microphone M__bius transformation Strategic management Diffraction Rolling-element bearing IMAX Motorcycle Inflation Methamphetamine Infantilism Nuclear weapon design Microeconomics Medical prescription Ultraviolet Technicolor Social rule Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Diabetes mellitus Bipolar disorder Trilobite Cataract Prolactinoma Age of Enlightenment Laser Jet engine

a friend says a dr told her glasses make your eyes weaker my friend squints horribly when trying to read something but when i told her go get contacts if you don t want glasses she said a dr told her glasses only make your eyes weaker than they are i think if your eyes are bad enough to squint you already have weak eyes what is your opinion a lot of people including me think that wearing glasses and or contacts can make your eyes dependant on the glasses so they do get slowly worse i think of it as your eyes start to relax as they get used to the luxury of glasses and they need the glasses so pretty much once you start wearing glasses contacts you have to wear them forever  Social rule Glasses Eyeglass prescription Glass Myopia Theory of conduct Sunglasses Pitaten Aberration in optical systems Denis Law The Ashlee Simpson Show Steve Taylor Monocle Milton H.

question about contacts can i take naps in them like only minutes so i dont have to take them off wash my hands all over again and clean them will it do something bad to the contacts usually minutes is ok i asked my optometrist and he said it was ok just that with eyelids closed and contacts in the surface of the eye does not get enough oxygen as the eye draws oxygen from the air sometimes laying down they can shift a little but this is usually more uncomfortable than dangerous  Contact lens Eyelid Fire fighting Rebreather Optometry Social rule Tetrapod Drowning Eye Carbon dioxide Breathing gas Bates Method Diving cylinder Gas metal arc welding Motorcycle Milton H.

getting contacts soon help im getting contacts in about weeks can anyone give me some tips advice info on them is it hard putting them in helppp thanks jim i would suggest geting soft contacts they are easier to put in are less noticeable and you can wear them longer when i first got my contacts my doctor wouldn't let me leave before i could put my contacts in take them out and then put them back in again it took me about an hour to even get one contact in but now it's a breeze it only takes about seconds to put both contact in some important information about soft contacts there are two sides to a contact soft contacts can flip back and forth so make sure you check to see if you are putting your contact in the correct way when you hold your contact up it should look like half of an orange not like an umbrella your doctor should show this to you but if they don't just ask it's important to clean your contacts when you take them out and when you put them in nothing hurts more then putting a contact in that has a piece of dirt or a hair on it don't go swimming when you have your contacts in if you go underwater although i find that taking a shower with them in is okay it's not very comfortable in a lake or a pool the chlorine in the pool can make your eyes burn too this is kind of obvious but i still do it sometimes without even thinking don't rub your eyes when you are wearing your contacts your contact can pop out or worse get caught in the corner of your eye it's even possible for your contacts to rip this has never happened to me but it has happened to one of my friends take your contacts out when you go to sleep funny for me to offer this advice because i rarely do but it's bad for your eyes if you don't if you forgot to take them out or couldn't for some reason keep a bottle of eyedrops around when you wake up your eyes will be very dry and it can be quite painful it's easier just to take them out plus your eyes need a break just like the rest of your body finally change your contacts as needed if you wear daily contacts make sure to change them everyday the same goes for days one month your contacts can go bad just like food and there is no point in wearing them if they are bad as for putting in your contacts you'll have to experiment and see what works for you i personally only use one finger to keep my eye open but my friend can't do it without two your doctor should offer you some advice when i first got my contacts i didn't want to wear them because it took so long for me to get them in the more you practice the easier it will be i love contacts although they can sometimes be a hassle i would never go back to just wearing glasses i hope this helps you out  Social rule The Shining (film) Contact lens Mattress Diving Breastfeeding Volleyball Fecal incontinence Violin Milton H.

i get dizzy while reading but my vision is not blurry whats the problem also recently while plucking eyebrows i was right up next to the mirror and my vision was blurry afterwards and i found it hard to focus on my image in the mirror at such a close angle that also made me a bit dizzy with reading it doesn't matter how far or near the book is it still makes me dizzy after awhile you could have astigmaism its an irregular folding of the cornea causing light to skew as it enters your eye that could explain why you get dizzy reading you should have your eyes seen by an ophthalmologist they would ask you to look into a machine and it would automatically determine if you are near far sighted or if you are astigmatic its called a refractometer it really could be something as simple as that  Eye Astigmatism Glasses Myopia Autostereogram Stereoscopy Contact lens LASIK Eyeglass prescription Eyepiece Keratoconus Automatic number plate recognition Telescope Color Diabetic retinopathy Iris (anatomy) Bates Method Intraocular lens Eye examination Ophthalmology Speed of light Reflecting telescope Aberration in optical systems Parallax Glaucoma Light Philosophy of perception Dizziness M16 (rifle) Red eye (medicine) Presbyopia Alhazen Rendering (computer graphics) Refractive surgery Drill bit Topiramate Tenshinhan Eye contact Lens (optics) Dyslexia Cornea transplant Depth of field Spatial disorientation Gas metal arc welding ZX Spectrum Amblyopia Surveillance Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Sextant Tank Visual perception Albinism Enterprise content management Filter (optics) Solar system Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Gamma ray burst Banned episodes of Pok__mon Optometry Galileo spacecraft Machine gun Time travel Balance disorder Macro photography Compound eye Computer vision Laser Machine vision Faster-than-light Knife Night vision Unidentified flying object Glen Jacobs Hipparchus (astronomer) Macular degeneration Stomach cancer Color blindness C programming language Perspective projection distortion Parabola Optical character recognition Amateur telescope making Prank flash Blindness Traumatic brain injury Snellen chart Single-lens reflex camera Eye surgery Navigation Science The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Dizzy Gillespie David Hume Charles Wheatstone Double bass Welding Sundial Keynesian economics

does anyone know why california requires an eye exam every year while most other states require it every two i've just spent twice as much now as when i didn't have health insurance for what i think is a 'padded' bill for a yearly eye exam and contact lens prescription is there any reason other than that california has a well funded optometrists lobby that health care takes a back seat to sales in this state you are required to get a contact lens exam every year not eyeglass exam a contact lens exam is required annually because you are putting something directly in your eyes and the doctor needs to make sure you have no eye problems eyeglass exams are every two because you don't run the same risks as you do with contacts  Optometry Glasses Eyeglass prescription Medical prescription Contact lens Publicly funded medicine Medicare (Canada) Prostate cancer Education in the United States Juris Doctor Myopia Eye Physician General practitioner LASIK Medicine Actuary Health care in the United States Lens (optics) Bates Method Keratoconus American Medical Association Presbyopia Canadian and American health care systems compared Ophthalmology Intraocular lens National Health Service Podiatrist Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Health savings account Medicare (United States) Architect Digital photography Arguments for and against drug prohibition Life insurance Physical therapy Health care in Canada Chiropractic Tom Vilsack Social Security (United States) Diabetes mellitus Insurance Education in Portugal Education in Germany Stomach cancer Graduate school Pharmaceutical company Lawyer Bill Frist Prescription drug Cornea Fathers' rights Education in Australia Physical examination Ultraviolet Apollo 8 Predestination paradox Eye contact Leica Bar examination Hillary Rodham Clinton Medical cannabis Abortion in the United States State Bar of California Wal-Mart Driver's license US health reform under FDR Education in Austria Real estate broker Psychiatric hospital Barbara Boxer Fecal incontinence US health reform 1912-1920 Master of Laws Civil engineering Test (student assessment) Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Cancer of the larynx Notary public Advanced Placement Program Emergency Medical Services Medicare (Australia) A-level Annuity Condom American and British English differences Procrastination Attorney at Law Tocopherol Common cold Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Hikikomori George Pataki Pharmacist Prolactinoma Stereoscopy Astigmatism United States House of Representatives Pitaten

is optometry school do able hey im an undergrade at bc and i would like to go into optometry but as i do more research on the proffesion im a little hesitant about the course work if anyone is an optometrist or an optometry student would you please tell me about your experience in optometry school i wouldn't have said that it was that difficult it was tedious in parts as there a fair stack of information to absorb especially on the biological side when i was studying years ago in the uk we were worked appreciably harder in terms of the volume of lectures and coursework than many of the other students at university but none of the material was terribly difficult as a career it has good and bad points it's fairly well paid but repetitive it has a flat career structure the day you qualify you're sitting in a little dark room looking at eyeballs the day you retire you're but it's an easy profession to return to after a break and a good one to work at part time which can be a real plus for women expecting to have families unless you get into management and running businesses work can be left behind at on the plus side you're working with people and often helping them significantly on the minus side you're working with people with all the hassles that can bring did you bring your old glasses no would you go to your dentist without your teeth you''re only allowed to think that last line no i can see to drive i just can't see the television and many many other similar mind boggling utterances i've done years as an optometrist and i'm taking a career break at the least it was good but between the patients and the bureaucracy i felt i'd had enough it may just be a mid life crisis but i know several other optometrists just locally who feel the profession isn't what it was  Graduate school Optometry Dentistry Doctorate Myopia Psychoanalysis Procrastination Stereoscopy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Scientology beliefs and practices Medical prescription Tai Chi Chuan Economics Undergrads Poker jargon Indiana University Bloomington Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Time Out of Mind Division of labour Rudolf Steiner Master's degree Shaggy dog story Unemployment Theory of conduct Babe Ruth Publicly funded medicine Project MKULTRA Juris Doctor Grade (education) Eyeglass prescription Education in Germany Teacher Lawrence J.

wearing contacts i just got contacts and i'm wondering how long it really takes to get used to them and if anyone has tricks on getting them in and out it doesn't take but a few days to get used to them in your ye t takes a little longer to get better at putting them in i just got them weeks ago and i love them when you put them in i use my middle finger but u can use your pointer finger whatever make sure your eye is really open use your fingers to keep it open on both the top and the bottom make sure your contact is wet and make sure the finger tip of the finger that u put the contact on is wet kind of dip it in the solution that will help it not stay on your finger put it in then keep your eye open and look down and all around then blink a few times and if it still kind of blurry close you eye and kind of pat and rub your eyelid don't worry it takes a few days to get used to putting them in the first day it took me minutes to put them in i think taking them out is easier just look up put your finger on the contact move it down and use your thumb to kind of pick it up that takes practice but i find it easier make sure you have some rewetting eye drops with you all the time for the first week or so your eyes might get dry and thats not comfortable good luck and just keep trying it takes practice  Aerial (dance move) Social rule Violin Knife Gesture Equine conformation Stereoscopy Volleyball Archery Diving suit Time Out of Mind Tenshinhan Textile manufacturing Chopsticks Salad Fingers Double bass Piccolo Junior Saga Contact lens Manicure Puppet The Shining (film) Mattress Milton H.

best place to get color contacts if i don't need contacts i currently don't need contacts but i want color contacts i can't go to like lenscrafter or anything because they say you need a presp but i don't have one because i don't need contacts where would i go to get contacts for myself color ones liek green or blue or purple or whatever under the law you need a prescription this is true even if your lenses don't have any vision correction in them called plano lenses and are used solely for cosmetic purposes the fda has issued a consumer alert regarding such lenses saying that they present significant risks of blindness and other eye injury if they are distributed without a prescription or without proper fitting by a qualified eye care professional so basically if you want color contact lenses you need a contact lens fitting done by an eye doctor this is the only safe and legal way to obtain any contact lens remember all contact lenses are regulated by the fda as a medical device  Eyeglass prescription Food and Drug Administration Contact lens Glasses Optometry Medical prescription Color Keratoconus Light-emitting diode Pharmaceutical company Emergency contraception Eye Controlled Substances Act First aid Medicine Medical cannabis Biomedical engineering Lens (optics) Photography Eyepiece RFID Color blindness Lighting Stereoscopy Publicly funded medicine Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Digital camera Kevin Trudeau Presbyopia Mercury (element) Methamphetamine Television School bus Diabetic retinopathy Botulin toxin Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Off-label use Regulation of therapeutic goods LASIK Ambulance Physician Bicycle lighting Gun safety Refractive surgery Health insurance Insurance Lightsaber Leica Airbag Food coloring Juris Doctor Herpes simplex virus Childbirth Photorefractive keratectomy Parallax Myopia Acne Animal testing Headlight Eye contact Ralph Nader Eye color Nuclear weapon design Arguments for and against drug prohibition Aspartame Enlarger Chromatic aberration Blindness Combine (Half-Life 2) Movie projector Aberration in optical systems Conjunctivitis Frogman Rei Ayanami Iris (anatomy) Dog Fluorescent lamp Laser Absinthe The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Billiards Tocopherol Health care in the United States Condom Ultraviolet Autostereogram Diver rescue Adverse effect (medicine) Prescription drug Migraine Digital photography Stage lighting Firefighter Appeal Child pornography Canon EOS Fathers' rights movement in the UK

what will happen at my contact lense consultation hi i'm and just over the last year my eye sight has worsened a little a couple of months ago i went for a eye test and the opition said i was slightly short sighted and that i needed glasses i bought a pair then and there she gave me lenses that were the weakest strenght so my eyes could get use to my new sight and told me to wear them for a month or two then on my next opintment she'd give me the strenght that i needed in glasses or contacts i've decided to go for contact lenses as i really don't like glasses and have booked an opintment for monday can someone please tell me exactly what will happen at my appointment i get quite nervous in optitions dentists or anything like that so i'd like to know what the opition will do thanks in advance to everybody that answers i went through exactly the same thing has she told you whether you're having hard or soft lenses i don't know if it's still standard but my optician started me off on hard because there's less chance of infection and they give slightly sharper vision anyway if she has your eye curvature already you'll be able to have a quick go at wearing contacts when i went she put them in for me first time which feels very weird just try to relax into it if they're hard contacts you may not be able to open your eyes fully for a while while your eye gets used to the contact your eyes might water quite a bit and your vision will not be anything near as good as when you get used to them so don't worry i had soft contacts later on and they feel soooo comfy its unbelievable i don't know whether it was cos i'd had hard lenses before but i didn't feel them in first time at all she will then test your sight in them and maybe check the fit by looking through some equipment at them i then got given a routine building up wear over the next few weeks and to practice putting them in  Contact lens Glasses Intraocular lens Eye Social rule Eyeglass prescription Sunglasses Parallax Keratoconus Stereoscopy Eyepiece Presbyopia Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Apollo 8 Shaggy dog story Strap-on dildo Lens (optics) Movie projector Equine conformation Eye contact RuneScape quests God Emperor of Dune Myopia Binoculars Tai Chi Chuan Stuttering Tenshinhan EastEnders The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines LASIK Aberration in optical systems Gamma ray burst Diabetic retinopathy The Smoking Room Prostate cancer Tire The Lovely Bones Ultraviolet 2000 Australian Grand Prix History of telescopes Piccolo Junior Saga View camera Extreme Programming Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Nystagmus Sharon Tate The Contender (television series) Haven (TNG episode) Ocean's Twelve The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Marilyn Monroe Time Out of Mind Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Poker jargon Brian Close Bicycle lighting Blood on the Tracks Syphon Filter M16 (rifle) About a Boy Jennifer Lopez Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Airsoft Dentistry Frogman Photographic lens Lensman Manual transmission Slow Train Coming Humphrey Bogart Nuclear weapon design Totally Spies!

wear contacts okay so i wear contacts instead of eye glasses and its my first time to ever have contacts so my contacts are tin and they are the flexable ones i also wear clear contacts so my contacts are suppose to expire in week do you think if i still keep on wearing them after they are expired it might hurt my eyes or do something to it or do you think i shouldn't wear them i would have bought more contacts but my job did a mistake with my check so thats the reason i couldn't by more contacts i would highly recommend not wearing them past the one week it wont hurt you too much if you use them a couple of days but not another full week the reason being is that they start to deteriorate and will bother your eyes much more than before also wearing them longer can cause permanent damage to your eyes what you my want to consider is contacting your doctors office and telling them what happened most of the time they will give you a trial pair free since you have to go back and get more anyway i have had to do this before and they were always very nice about it i went in explained my situation ordered the new ones box for each eye and they gave me a couple pairs to tide me over  Social rule The Shining (film) Theory of conduct Contact lens Ocean's Twelve Plame affair Colony in Space New York Giants Roswell UFO incident Diving Fancy Crane Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Rei Ayanami The Parting of the Ways Avenue Q The Five Doctors Day of the Daleks The Contender (television series) Solar cell Marilyn Monroe Infantilism Father's Day (Doctor Who) Pitaten Sin City Glasses Starfleet ranks and insignia Boom Town (Doctor Who) Battle of the Bulge The Empty Child High-heeled shoe Leeds United F.C.

any tips or suggestions i just got contacts i used to have contacts but now my eyes get too dry for some reason i have not figured out yet make sure you clean them everyday if they are that kind take them out at night or when you are sleeping they will be much more comfortable the next day wash your hands before you do anything with your eyes or contacts if there is a lot of wind or dust close your eyes so you don't get dirt in them carry eye drops with you in case they feel dry you can moisten them while they are right in your eye i got so good at this i could even put drops in while i was driving using one hand at first i had trouble getting them on the front of my eye and then i discovered that when you are putting them in look in the mirror at your eye not at the contact and finger coming at you if you look at the contact coming at your eye you will be more likely to blink if you drop it in the sink stop everything and look for it don't move it will be in the most unexpected spot that's about all i know they are so much more comfortable to wear than glasses  Eye Social rule The Amber Spyglass Contact lens Time Out of Mind Electrophysiology Volleyball Stereoscopy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Skateboarding trick Milton H.

a question about my contacts i recently got contacts a few days ago i have no problem putting them in or taking them out and they are very comfortable i see great out of my left eye but i noticed that my right eye is slightly more blurry i'm not blind but i can't see quite as well as the other eye when both eyes are open my sight is fine should i be concerned about my right eye being deficient you may need a stronger prescription for your right eye call your eye doctor back and see if there's any way for you to get an appointment a slight adjustment to the strength of the contact for your right eye may help you a lot hope this helps  Eyeglass prescription Color blindness Autism Tenshinhan Eye Glasses Equine conformation Eye contact Piccolo Junior Saga Color Social rule Volleyball Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Diabetic retinopathy Tocopherol Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Stereoscopy Keratoconus Glossary of partner dance terms The Keeper of Traken Ocean's Twelve Myopia Optometry Contact lens Folic acid Anorexia nervosa The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Snooker The Shining (film) Dragon Booster Boom Town (Doctor Who) Horse gait Psoriasis Strap-on dildo Amblyopia Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Eyepiece Asperger syndrome Medical prescription YuYu Hakusho Sunglasses Parallax Rugby union positions Hal Trosky Pyramids of Mars Naruto kekkei genkai Presbyopia Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Professional wrestling throws 2005 English cricket season Intraocular lens Publicly funded medicine Book of Isaiah Haven (TNG episode) Speed of light Growth hormone treatment Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Psychiatric hospital Greys Dog Mystique (comics) Star Wars Chronic fatigue syndrome Prostate cancer Milton H.

need glasses or a second opinion last week my year old daughter had her physical and i was told that her vision was however her left eye is the doctor insisted that i have her checked next year i was thinking that i should have her tested again by an eye doctor any suggestions side bar i don't want to get glasses too early as she will become dependent on them on the other hand i don't want her bumping into walls she already has two left feet d if bad eyesight runs in the family i would go ahead and get her eyes checked honestly the results that you get during a physical will likely be different then what your child will see in an optometrists office the optometrist will be able to tell if your child has an astigmatism or any other vision problems that need to be addressed and rather than thinking about the potential of your daughter becoming dependent on eyewear that will help her see better i would think of the good that would come from her getting adjusted to lower prescriptions that could potentially be stronger in the future of course that is if she even has a need for eyewear on a personal note my oldest daughter was when i got about the same results your daughter did during a physical i took her in to the optometrist i worked for at the time and her visual acuity was and a little different then during the physical he prescribed a in both eyes now years later she is wearing a in both eyes i was glad that i started her so young because then it wasn't such a shock as her prescription increased  Glasses Eyeglass prescription Optometry Eye Myopia Snellen chart Bates Method Glaucoma Diving Medical prescription Visual acuity Amblyopia Keratoconus Clinical depression Diabetic retinopathy Physical examination Stomach cancer Contact lens Diabetes mellitus Blindness LASIK 2000 Australian Grand Prix Medicare (Canada) Inflation The Unquiet Dead Eye examination Theory of conduct Stereoscopy Goggles Ultraviolet Multiple sclerosis Dyslexia Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Mach kernel Visual perception Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Extreme Programming Addiction Urinary incontinence Division of labour Orthoptics Cannabis (drug) Wolfrider Target Corporation The Shining (film) Traumatic brain injury The Doctor Dances Abortion debate Keynesian economics Internet troll Methamphetamine Psoriasis Medical record Autostereogram Father's Day (Doctor Who) Eyepiece Hypnosis Fecal incontinence Social rule Equine conformation Milton H.

can showering in your contact lens hurt your eyes i've been doing this occasionally for years with no ill effects but someone at work told me yesterday that it's incredibly dangerous and can really damage your eyes i'm a bit sceptical is this true i wouldn't say it is incredibly dangerous wearing your contact lenses in the shower increases your risk of eye infection or irritation if you exposure your contact lenses to water bacteria and contaminates can attach themselves to the contact lens this can cause you to experience irritation or even an eye infection infections in some cases can become very serious and even result in loss of vision so technically yes showering in your lenses could hurt your eyes but i wouldn't say it is incredibly dangerous lol  Conjunctivitis Contact lens Multiple sclerosis Methamphetamine Diabetes mellitus Legionellosis Eye Diving Ultraviolet Herpes simplex virus Group A streptococcal infection Eczema Coeliac disease Intravenous therapy Swimming Toxoplasmosis Common cold Urinary incontinence Traumatic brain injury Radiation poisoning Gonorrhoea Hip fracture Penis enlargement Rocky Mountain spotted fever Escherichia coli O157:H7 Keratoconus Glasses Psoriasis Foodborne illness Eyeglass prescription Breastfeeding Sexually-transmitted infection LASIK Bathing Stereoscopy Refractive surgery Diarrhea Botulism Aspartame Otitis externa Tuberculosis Cytomegalovirus Myopia Diabetic retinopathy Narcotic Hard disk Sewage treatment Computer virus Intraocular lens Lyme disease Cephalic disorder Ulcer Bleeding View camera Leptospirosis Spider Anthrax Chronic fatigue syndrome Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Quarantine Depth of field Sunglasses Aspergillosis Nuclear explosion Smoke-screen Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma AIDS Airbag Hydrogen sulfide Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Eye contact Safe sex Iris (anatomy) Poliomyelitis Reiter's syndrome Cancer Smallpox Escherichia coli Transmission (medicine) 2001 anthrax attacks Diplopia HIV Parkinson's disease Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Acne Ulcerative colitis Hepatitis C Use of poison gas in World War I Diseases of the honeybee Rabies Eyepiece Snake Chernobyl accident Items in the Metroid series Tularemia Nuclear fallout Photorefractive keratectomy Formic acid

is it true that wearing glasses will make your eyes smaller i started to wear glasses near sighted and my mom told me that wearing glasses all the time will make my eyes go in and shrink up like its dried or something is that true wearing glasses won't make your eyes smaller but i don't recommend you to wear it the whole time because u would rely on it and you couldn't do anything if u don't have ur glass and u look weird when you don't have them on i no i wear my glass for about ten years the whole time and my eyes changed now that my eye seem to be pop out a little more than usually so i change to contacts wearing glasses too long would make your eyes look like the gold fish's eyes so i suggest you wear them when you need them like doing your homework etc but don't wear it on regular bases when i was little i put it on the whole time but i regret it now  Sunglasses Glasses "Weird Al" Yankovic Contact lens Shaggy dog story Jennifer Lopez Stereoscopy Paul Is Dead The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Social rule Parallax RuneScape quests Jon Secada YuYu Hakusho Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Shen Gong Wu Happy Tree Friends Whose Line Is It Anyway?

most people are uncomfortable making eye contact with people with crossed eyes i have crossed eyes the eye i'm not using will always cross inward some people say they never know what i'm looking at and eye contact is uncomfortable so when i talk to people should close or squint the eye i am not using so people know where to look it bothers me that people are uncomfortable looking me in the eyes when i talk to them i like making eye contact because i want people to know i'm listening and i care would it be too weird if i close one eye just an idea that just hit me i don't know what else i can do i honestly know how you feel i was born with both of my eyes crossed inward they were both corrected by a strabismus surgery but the results were not permanent now i have two lazy eyes and only one focuses at a time i am nearsighted in one and farsighted in the other so it is hard for me to look individuals straight in the eye what i try and do is just look them in the eye and if they are not mature enough to handle the fact that we all have our own disabilities in one form or another then why bother with them you deserve to be around individuals who will do what they can to make you feel comfortable about your situation i wish you the best of luck in all you do  Strabismus Contact lens Social rule Glasses Theory of conduct Milton H.

contacts im gunna get contacts in a few days and i was wondering do u have too get use to them i mean like where they for hrs one day and stuff like that usually there is a break in period when you first start wearing them your eye doctor will tell you how it works but usually you start out with wearing them a certain number of hours each day and increase that by an hour or each day after that until you are wearing them for the whole day i held off for a long time in getting contacts because i never wanted to feel like there was something in my eye and i didn't like the whole notion of putting a foreign object in my eye however once i finally decided to get them i was amazed to find out that most of the time i didn't even feel them when they were in and if i did it was usually at the end of the day when it was time to take them out anyway  The Amazing Race 1957 World Series Hour Social rule Shaggy dog story The Ashlee Simpson Show Milton H.

how comfortable are contacts what is the best brand to get i have been wearing glasses most of my life and want a change im thinking of getting contact so when i go out i don't have to worry about them falling out and wearing glasses for home what is the best brand are they comfortable plus when i go home i just want to fall into bed are they that high maintenance well i just started wearing contacts weeks ago they are a lot of maintenance at first it still takes me about minutes to get them in in the morning i can now take them out very quickly but the first week i really struggled with that part i do love them though now that i am used to them you barely feel them throughout the day and i can see way better with them opposed to my glasses since they are right on the eye it just takes some practice and patience at the beginning most contacts are fda approved for overnight wear but i wouldn't recommend it i tried it at first so i wouldn't have to bother putting them in in the morning they did not feel so good when i got up anyway if you have patience for the first few weeks you will love them and who knows you may be able to pick it up quicker than me good luck  Time Out of Mind Social rule Mattress About a Boy Customs and etiquette of Japan Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Avenue Q Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Blood on the Tracks The Emancipation of Mimi Extreme Programming Scenes from a Memory Slow Train Coming Oh My Goddess!

eye colors why do we have different color eyes and what does the different colors good for the eye colours result from the depth of melanin pigments in the irises brown eyes result from pigments close to the iris surface blue and green eyes result from pigments deep in the iris then albinos have the appearance of pink or red eyes because they lack melanin so light enters and reflects off the blood vessels in the eye giving the pink or red colour i think the colours are for beautification but i don't know what other purpose they serve  Iris (anatomy) Eye color Albinism Color Heterochromia Cat coat genetics Human skin color Melanin Hair color Eye Color blindness Primary color Red-eye effect Color theory Retina Staining (biology) Color vision Red Pointillism Red hair CMYK color model Georges-Pierre Seurat Uvea Chameleon Discus (fish) Dobermann RGB color model Diamond Food coloring Black Rainbow Ultramarine Laser hair removal Color depth Peafowl Beet Iridology Dominance relationship Birthmark Macular degeneration Paint Cheetah White tiger Pixel Light-emitting diode Impressionism Drawing Abalone Color space Camouflage Blue Ultraviolet Sunglasses Chlorophyll Stereoscopy Ink Iris (plant) Lighting Parallax Cosmetics Siberian Husky Green Beret Lapis lazuli Wallpaper group Sonic the Hedgehog Extraterrestrial skies John Dalton CIE 1931 color space Sunscreen Contact lens Autostereogram Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Leaf Vampire Squid Pupil Blood Fluorescent lamp Snooker Crocodilia Variegation Diamond cut Anaglyph image Black panther Garnet Political colour Color temperature Hair coloring Blond Skin Material properties of diamond Nuwaubianism Eyepiece Diamond simulant White Eyelid Dragon Booster Potato Power Rangers

i just got back from the eye doctor i have huge pupils and i see very poorly hi guys i went to the eye doctor this morning to check my vision everything was fine and they dropped some eye drops into my eyes so that they would dilate and so they could check for anything abnormal apparently the assistant forgot to tell me that we had to come back to the office so i wasn't checked so i was dilated for nothing anywho my pupils have been huge and my vision has been poor for the past hours is this normal when will it go away it might take the rest of the day for the dilation to go away it's normal to have huge pupils and have unclear vision when your eyes are dilated i hope you wore sunglasses when you were coming home from the optometrist not wearing sunglasses can cause some eye damage since the dilation makes your eyes much more irritated by light well really you needed the sunglasses outside and they might have been important inside if you were using any really bright lights  Diabetic retinopathy Glasses Glaucoma Iris (anatomy) Sunglasses Eye Eye examination Pupil Hypoglycemia Intraocular lens Childbirth Medical prescription Traumatic brain injury Turner syndrome Deadly nightshade Intact dilation and extraction Contact lens Red eye (medicine) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Breech birth Binoculars Sunlight Methamphetamine Diabetes mellitus Optometry Cat Red-eye effect Eyeglass prescription Migraine Multiple sclerosis Time dilation Stroke Blonde on Blonde Saint Nicholas Solar eclipse Equine conformation Speed of light Keratoconus Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Intracranial pressure Cyclops (comics) Stereoscopy Atropine Street light Combine (Half-Life 2) Slit lamp Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fecal incontinence Autonomic nervous system Iritis Poker jargon Eye color Binocular vision Bret Hart Milton H.

which contact lenses do you have to replace the least i'm thinking about getting contacts and i was wondering which ones i should get if i don't want to have to replace it every weeks you would have to get a daily wear contact lens however the daily wear lenses require a great deal of maintenance to ensure that they stay clean throughout the year they require nightly cleanings and weekly enzymatic cleanings this is important so that bacteria and protein does not build up on the lens and cause an eye infection many solutions claim to do all the work with one solution but in my experience they are not fully effective disposables may cost more in the long run but are thinner therefore more comfortable less maintenance and healthier for your eye that should give you something to consider before making a decision  Contact lens Psoriasis Body piercing Sunglasses Water Herpes simplex virus Sewage treatment Glasses Cell (biology) Eye LASIK Common cold Keratoconus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cinematography Stereoscopy Motility Intraocular lens Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Binoculars View camera Brewery Mattress Energy development Diseases of the honeybee Dairy Conjunctivitis Aberration in optical systems Prostate cancer Escherichia coli O157:H7 Antiseptic Iris (anatomy) Fugu Eyeglass prescription Breastfeeding Extreme Programming M16 (rifle) Malaria Consensus decision-making Insulin Lens (optics) Air New Zealand Social rule Hygiene Tire Political economy Embalming Autonomous building Galactic Civilizations Hydrochloric acid Domestic rabbit Ophthalmology Upholstery Strategic management Items in the Metroid series Customer relationship management Guinea pig Nutrition Protein-energy malnutrition Multiple sclerosis Toxoplasmosis Menstrual cup Dog Diabetes mellitus Stopping e-mail abuse Fancy rat Cataract Tooth Plutonium Baldness Francis Crick Molecular biology Composting toilet Refractive surgery Strap-on dildo Eye contact Traditional Chinese medicine Space Shuttle program Methamphetamine Len Wein Menstrual cycle Presbyopia Hamster Violin Cornea Motor oil Eyepiece Wound Telescope Acne Vaccine Haloalkane Campfire Silver Linux Sterilization (microbiology) Growth hormone treatment Church of Christ, Scientist Marine aquarium Table saw

what eye prescription would be classified as legally blind i don't understand what or even means all i know is that my prescription for my left eye is and my right eye is and someone told me that means that i'm legally blind is that true and what is the prescription number to be classified as legally blind i know all of that i've read wikipedia and i've searched the internet i just want to know if my prescription means that i'm legally blind no and are rather high numbers but if your glasses contacts can correct you so that you can see or better you are not legally blind therefore there isn't a dividing mark in terms of what makes you legally blind or not granted if glasses didn't exist you certainly would be legally blind estimated diopters of nearsightedness and farsightedness as well although sometimes they can compensate at distances so they might have to have a higher prescription than that is enough to make you see only i cannot see without my glasses with my prescription and that's still a lot smaller in magnitude than your or  Eyeglass prescription Myopia Blindness Eye Easement Presbyopia Aberration in optical systems Insurance Medical prescription Poker jargon Betting (poker) Electrophysiology Stereoscopy Illegal drug trade Literature Snellen chart Sunglasses Contact lens United States Postal Service Species Sheepshead Pharmaceutical company Grammar German language Milton H.

how long should it take to get used to new glasses i just got new glasses days ago after not wearing glasses for years my right eye lense is times stronger than the left so it's a big difference for me is it normal for things to not look as clear when you have each eye so different it feels like it was easier all these years without glasses i have farsightedness in one eye and nearsightedness in the other eye and i do notice that things are not quite as clear as they should be like i lost a little bit of depth perception since both eyes need to be close to the same prescription for everything to look right i can tell that my lenses are projected at different distances the image is placed farther from my nearsighted eye and close to my farsighted eye if you are like me you'll probably find that you have a dominant eye that you will be using more and that's not because you have lazy eye or anything it will probably be the eye that is less hyperopic or if you have two nearsighted eyes it could be either and you will surely get used to it with time if at the end of two weeks you don't feel that everything is right go back to the person who prescribed you the glasses to see if you need to make any adjustments with the prescriptions or if there is anything else you can do  Myopia Glasses Eyeglass prescription Stereoscopy Autostereogram Eye Strabismus Amblyopia View camera Parallax Anaglyph image Binocular vision Photographic lens Social rule Macro photography Presbyopia Stereopsis Eyepiece Depth of field Microscope Sunglasses Characters in the Smurfs Binoculars Cinematography Lens (optics) IMAX Shen Gong Wu Diplopia Diabetic retinopathy Aberration in optical systems Time Out of Mind Red dot sight Medical prescription Hall & Oates Camera Drill bit Perspective projection distortion Intraocular lens Single-lens reflex camera Astronomy on Mars Nystagmus Lucid dreaming Pinhole camera Equine conformation Australian English Textile manufacturing Extrasolar planet Dimension Fecal incontinence Anamorphic widescreen Binocular rivalry Theory of conduct Psoriasis Trilobite Telescope History of telescopes Depth perception Eye contact Keratoconus Movie projector Max Martin The Ashlee Simpson Show Cinerama Jon Secada Dyslexia Time Enlarger Glass Falsifiability Philosophy of perception Milton H.

can you lose eyesight by watching too much t v or being on the computer too long if you are nearsighted your nearsightedness can get worse if you do a lot of close up work i worked at a discount store when i was in high school and my eyes got a lot worse because i was looking at price tags and entering the price in the cash register all close up work my eye doctor said when on the computer you should look away about every minutes or so being on the computer would affect your eyes more than watching tv because you sit closer to the screen when you are on the computer just try to do things that allow you to focus far away as well as close and you should be fine  Myopia Video game crash of 1983 Commodore International Apple Computer IBM PC compatible Mutual fund Glasses Inflation Sears Holdings Corporation The Long Game Crime film Autostereogram Atari 2600 Henri Poincar__ Tariff Columbine High School massacre Year 2000 problem Computer animation Treehouse of Horror V Denis Law Octopus card London Congestion Charge Color Theory of conduct Penguin Commodore 64 Visual acuity Microeconomics Digital photography Digital MapleStory Intellectual property Corporate finance CPU cache Paintball Stereoscopy Pricing Milton H.
