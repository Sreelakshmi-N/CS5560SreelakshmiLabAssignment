why do the gears on my bike change when i dont want them too i've recently bought an xc mountain bike with gears and i can be riding along quite happily but it will suddenly slip through the gears on the rear wheel and drop into and stay there anyone know why am i riding it wrong i've not had a bike with gears before and even though the people in the shop have tried to explain it to me i'm still not sure about it whats the best way to ride it and in what gear should it jump into another gear like this any help would be appreciated i'm riding on roads along a river bank and up and down slight hills nothing too dramatic not sure if that makes a difference to the first reply i've been driving a geared car for nearly years and never had so much as a slight knock i currently drive a seater mpv and i would bet any money you care to suggest that i can reverse it into a space a in one move and b better than you thank you to everyone else the bike has now gone back into the shop and they are dealing with it as said by many your gears need adjustment it has nothing to do with the way your ride since you recently bought your bike take it to that shop for service maybe it will fall within the warranty any way it is nothing to expensive to do the best gear to use is the one that is comfortable to you according to the ground level uphill etc your speed strenght etc so select a gear that you are comfortable with a leisure pace would be about pedeles per minute as fast one would be about to or so are for fit cyclist sprints etc not a place you are likely to live in for very long remember big cog in front bigger effort big cog in the back smaller effort they are the opposite one from the other so a small gear in front and the biggest on the back would be your lightest uphill gear the biggest in front and the smallest in the back would be the one that requiers more effort but will give more meters per pedalling stroke will make you go faster if you can spin you pedals in that gear use it for fast cycling in level ground or down hill at speed in between this two option would be the front and back cog combination that will be the most comfortable for you according to the effort you want to put into each stroke the speed you want to sustain if the ground is level or not something our bodies are fast to tell us without having to think to much about it so enjoy and do not worry to much you will know what to do in very little time  Bicycle Recumbent bicycle Mountain bike Fixed-gear bicycle Bicycle lighting Manual transmission Mountain biking Bicycle frame Motocross Car handling Bicycle brake systems Bike lane debate Transmission (mechanics) Racing bicycle Cycling Single-speed bicycle Vehicular cycling Drag racing Professional wrestling throws Fast bowling Horse gait Toyota Prius Derailleur gears Gear Chevrolet Corvair Land Rover (Series/Defender) Bicycling terminology Differential (mechanics) Four wheel drive Shaggy dog story 24 Hours of Le Mans Combine harvester Unicycle Turbocharger Steering Drifting (motorsport) Bicycle helmet Track cycling Lance Armstrong Aerial (dance move) Penny-farthing Tire Sport utility vehicle Rugby union positions Transportation of Los Angeles BMW De Lorean DMC-12 Shifter (bicycle part) Speed of light Ford Thunderbird Indianapolis 500 Toyota MR2 Shimano Nissan Skyline Honda CX series Horse Electrophysiology Volleyball Windsurfing Gear ratio Top Gear B-47 Stratojet Tractor Segregated cycle facilities Individual time trial Utility cycling Track bicycle Stage (bicycle race) Radio controlled airplane Ford Falcon Diesel engine Paragliding Professional wrestling attacks Kitesurfing Badminton 2000 Australian Grand Prix Star Wars: Battlefront Tour de France Lawn mower Dodge Charger Strap-on dildo Internal ballistics Automatic transmission BMW M5 Emergency brake Cog railway

what are the best kind of tires i should buy for my bike i only bike within my city i dont bike on dirt trails confirm your correct tire size check the label on the side of the tire it's probably something like x c or x the first number is the diameter the second the width indicator go to a large bike shop and ask to see their city tires or commuter or slicks in that size for an urban setting with lots of potholes and bad pavement i'd go with some tread but you don't need knobbies i do recommend getting the heavy duty flat prevention models for a typical suburban situation you can go with lighter skinnier tires that will feel faster and hold higher pressure to roll better the bike shop dude should be happy to explain the options if they don't have a good selection either try another shop or ask to see some catalogs so they can order for you good luck scott  Tire Mountain bike Motorcycle Bicycle Mountain biking Car handling All-terrain vehicle Bicycle lighting Equine conformation Bicycle brake systems Schwinn Bicycle Company Racing bicycle BMX Bike lane debate Rail terminology Gramophone record Handloading Fast bowling Sport utility vehicle Cycling Suburb Mattress Motocross Stairway Theory of conduct Transportation of Los Angeles Poker jargon Movie projector Binoculars Canadian Tire Bicycle wheel Anchor Drifting (motorsport) Urban sprawl Transmission Control Protocol Chopper (motorcycle) Prostate cancer E85 Manual transmission Public transport Cyclo-cross Table saw Light rail Trail Redundant array of independent disks Expert system CPU cache Turbocharger Passenger car Normal distribution Utility cycling Betting (poker) Bicycle frame Triathlon Violin Wood Dog agility Recumbent bicycle Airport Street Ford Explorer Curb extension Drill bit Upholstery M16 (rifle) Road Segregated cycle facilities Singlish Rolling-element bearing Terminal ballistics Floppy disk 2000 Australian Grand Prix Drag racing Microeconomics 2-stroke power valve system Tri-Stat dX Bicycle touring Horse Vehicular cycling Bus models used in New York City Transit Scientology beliefs and practices Single-speed bicycle Bulk vending Speed limit Typewriter Roman road Water polo Oscilloscope Stopping power Road Rash Eaton's Chevrolet Corvair Compact disc Penny-farthing Hat Kart racing Oklahoma City, Oklahoma United States Postal Service Electrophysiology Craps

does anyone know a really good mountain bike i can get for about im conidering the mongoose xr but its a little too expensive at all the previous posters are right however i too had a tough time shelling out or more on something i wasn't sure i was going to really get into i spent on a full suspension mt bike from k mart about years ago it didn't have any good components on it other than the sram twist grip shifters which still aren't that great i have taken good care of this bike cleaning it after most rides cleaning the chain regularly and it hasn't let me down even once last year i found i was riding on the road a lot more than off and started researching road bikes as a father of kids under the age of i found it difficult to part with or more on a new entry level ride i happened to stumble across someone selling an older trek they guy gave a really good deal on it and now i'm riding that about of the time i still have the cheap k mart mt bike and ride it when taking the kids out for a ride around the neighborhood my recommendation is if you like the mongoose buy it but don't mistake it for a serious mt bike you will be disappointed go ahead and take it off road if you want but don't try any big jumps or drops i would suggest not getting a full suspension one like i did it's way too inefficient for light trail and road riding go for one with a front suspension with a hardtail you will have better efficiency when riding on the road and up hills have fun and be safe  Mountain bike Bicycle Bicycle frame Shifter (bicycle part) Racing bicycle Lance Armstrong Recumbent bicycle Bicycle lighting Wal-Mart Segregated cycle facilities Vehicular cycling Car handling Equine conformation Cycling Humphrey Bogart The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man RuneScape quests Diving CPU cache Volkswagen Golf Drifting (motorsport) Whistler-Blackcomb Social rule The Ashlee Simpson Show M16 (rifle) All-terrain vehicle Sport utility vehicle Microeconomics Automobile Paragliding Bike lane debate Skateboarding trick Bicycle helmet Single-speed bicycle Milton H.

looking to buy a touring bike i am looking to buy a bicycle for touring i would like ot be able to put on some luggage bags and racks and do some overnighters and multiple day tours and i plan on riding daily for fitness my local dealer recommended a trek i rode it and it felt nice but i think its more for amature racing than long distance touring i would prefer an american made bike but european would be ok nothing made in china does anyone know about tommaso bikes lastly i am trying to stay around or under any suggestions would be appreciated when i say american or euro i know its a given that shimano is going to be some place on there as for the price limit i just speaking of the bike not the accessories which i plan to add over time i am looking for an aluminum frame maybe with carbon fiber forks basically i am looking for something similar to the trek but more for touring you're right about the the geometry is just too tight for long range touring in addition to rack and fender mounts a real touring bike is going to have a slacker head tube and longer chainstays both of which make for more stable low speed handling and the long chainstays also allow more room for rear panniers touring bikes also have room for bigger tires than road bikes which will have a much bigger impact on ride comfort than frame or fork material the trek and cannondale t might be close to your price range  Bicycle Bicycle frame Mountain bike Recumbent bicycle Cycling Racing bicycle Motorcycle Cannondale Bicycle Corporation Bicycle brake systems Touring bicycle Utility cycling Mountain biking Chopper (motorcycle) Cyclo-cross Triathlon Car handling Carbon fiber Schwinn Bicycle Company Bicycle wheel Honda CX series Bicycle touring Knife Tire Mattress B-47 Stratojet Euro Track bicycle Dodge Charger Equine conformation Penny-farthing Cyfac Bicycle commuting Ford Ranger EV Motocross View camera M16 (rifle) Horse gait Timpani Shifter (bicycle part) Tour de France Mercedes-Benz A-Class Bike lane debate Trek Bicycle Corporation Kayak Junkers Ju 188 Textile manufacturing Derailleur gears Windsurfing Aluminium Space elevator Plastic BMW Bike trials riding Shimano Vehicular cycling Segregated cycle facilities Bicycle helmet NASCAR Motorcycle helmet Inline speed skating Road bicycle racing Passenger car De Lorean DMC-12 Transportation of Los Angeles Welding Golf club (equipment) Fixed-gear bicycle Automobile Yosemite National Park Heinkel He 112 Hiking Toyota Camry Single-speed bicycle Radio controlled airplane Valentino Rossi Harley-Davidson Rockers Expanded Universe (Star Wars) BMX Shimano Total Integration All-terrain vehicle Volkswagen Jetta Badminton Mitsubishi 3000GT STS-62 Sport utility vehicle 24 Hours of Le Mans TGV Jan Ullrich Dodge Neon

long distance riding while carrying a lot of gear on long ride my heart rate monitor show usualy to beats per minute depend on hills my cadence is about and i noticed that i did feel one moment little short of breath no head wind and no hill gear temperature c behind me km one moment also i start sweating so badly had blure vision and finaly i had to stop and take the rest it happened to me for first time i did continue riding after about hour of rest and symptoms disapear from that moment i feel just fine what went wrong has anybody this experience one moment in the saddle i did feel that i will have blackout it sounds like dehydration the temperature was not too hot and you had not riden too far so it seems a bit strange in your discussion you do not mention drinking any liquids how much had you had to drink up until then as far as being out of breath i do not know how old you are or what your maximum hr is but for me is about my anaerobic threshold so as i start going above that i start getting winded i have also had similar symptoms light headedness in the spring on the first warm c day i attribute that to acclimation to the weather after riding in cold temperatures another thing that comes to mind is hypoglycemia low blood sugar when had you last eaten and what did you have to eat that can make you light headed it is very hard to diagnose without more information but any or all of those things could have contributed i suggest that you make sure you drink plenty of fluids and if you are doing a long ride take something for energy energy drinks and or energy bars of gels on an average temperature day i finish off a normal sized water bottle in miles and as it gets warmer i will come closer to two bottles i suspect you are from europe so i am hoping that the water bottles are similar is capacity i hope that helps some safe cycling  Hypoglycemia Hyperthermia Diabetes mellitus First aid Water Decompression sickness Dehydration Marathon (sport) Equine conformation Renewable energy Carbon dioxide Thermoregulation Avalanche Energy development Thermal power station Phase (matter) Bicycle Hypothermia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sun Recumbent bicycle Diabetic coma Coffee Rebreather Scuba set Intravenous therapy Drowning Chronic fatigue syndrome Stroke Time Out of Mind Myocardial infarction Explosive material Sauna Hiking Prostate cancer Fertility awareness 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Solar variation Guinea pig Common cold Alcoholic beverage Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Furnace Botulism Solar power Swimming Climate of the United Kingdom Urban heat island Heat Social rule National Weather Service Pneumonia Insulin Hydrogen sulfide Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Triathlon Brewery Severe weather terminology (United States) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shock Water (molecule) Entropy Nutrition Stomach cancer Siphon Pebble bed reactor El Ni__o Incandescent light bulb Milk Anchor Sleep Fire fighting Angina Plastic Chocolate Wine Motorcycle Traumatic brain injury Tide Speed of light Diving suit Steam engine Glycogen storage disease type I Captain Thunderbolt Cat Gout Panic attack Spinning (cycling) Anxiety Effects of global warming

help with bike chain okay soim going todescribe everything to you i was riding and i wasnt paying attention and i ran onto a curb hard then i started going down a hill and i realized i had a flat on the wheel that hit the curb so i proppeed my back wheel up and started walking it home upward so the pooped tire wouldnt run along the strrets then my backtire blew out too soo i had to finish walking home with too flats i changed the backtire with a new inner tube but i patched the front one it worked so now i just had to put the chain back on and when i rode i complety like tangled up and fell so now its hangin off and i cantt fingure out what to do so ima give you all some pics so you can see more thanxs http i photobucket com albums aa x xsickofthisscenex x pics jpg http i photobucket com albums aa x xsickofthisscenex x pics jpg http i photobucket com albums aa x xsickofthisscenex x pics jpg http i photobucket com albums aa x xsickofthisscenex x pics jpg great pics nice little ride by the way you have no problem with the chain there you have likely figured that out by now to untangle that chain do it without the rear wheel installed be very careful untangling that chain if you put too much lateral pressure on it anywhere you will bend a link in the chain untangling that chain means to make a continuous circle out of it again it looks like you can get some of it back on the front chain ring do this now with that half of the chain out of the way start pulling the remaining portion of the chain apart using up and down movements only do not put pressure sideways on the chain you hit hard enough to pop the tire you may have hit hard enough to damage the rear wheel make sure that it is still true straight and that there isn't a break in the actual rim furthermore if you lost your temper and maybe bent the chain you can check by watching for stuck links prior to making your final chain adjustments leave the chain a little loose while the back wheel is installed slowly pedal the bike and watch for links that once they go around a round part want to stay stuck like that between your gearing if you have a sticky link or two replace the chain i just remembered that that chain has a master link can you tell which one that is it is a link that looks just like every other one except that it has a clip on it remove the clip and take the chain apart it will make untangling it much easier and installing it easier too  Bicycle Bicycle brake systems Motorcycle Drill bit Mountain bike Tire Professional wrestling holds Car handling Bicycle frame Equine conformation Recumbent bicycle Poker jargon Skateboarding trick Sailing Aerial (dance move) Racing bicycle Manual transmission Fixed-gear bicycle Horse gait De Lorean DMC-12 Textile manufacturing Knife Indianapolis 500 M16 (rifle) Glossary of climbing terms Naval mine Fast bowling Differential (mechanics) Internal ballistics Journey (band) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Boxing Backstroke Kitesurfing Professional wrestling throws Four wheel drive Horse Brewery Glossary of American football Drifting (motorsport) Shaggy dog story Anchor Lawn mower Bicycle wheel Heinkel He 112 Transmission (mechanics) Electrophysiology Violin Strap-on dildo Motocross Bubble Bobble Cycling Messerschmitt Bf 109 Bicycle lighting Pottery GunZ The Duel Mattress Heinkel He 100 Tricycle Mitsubishi 3000GT Tank Glossary of nautical terms Caterpillar track Professional wrestling slang Tenshinhan Wheel of Fortune Chevrolet Corvair Time Out of Mind Arado Ar 80 The Price Is Right Guilty Gear Bon Jovi Semi-trailer Jackass: The Movie Carburetor Mazda Miata Derailleur gears Escape from New York Taikyoku shogi Bike lane debate Professional wrestling attacks Baseball Mario Kart: Double Dash!!

how can i make my bike a smoother ride short of getting a new fork suspension i don't know any way to make small things like riding off curbs less jarring my bike is a sort of hybrid between a road bike and a mountain bike with a moderately light frame but the thing about the suspension is it doesn't exist i don't have any shock absorbers springs etc and i can't afford to go all out and get a good fork what are some cheap things i can do to make a smoother ride in that respect would tire pressure have an effect i'm saying this because of the hummer h 's cts system which at the press of a button basically deflates the tire for tough off road situations and replaces the air for the road ok so tire deflation is out and my seat is very soft so is there absolutely nothing i could do besides getting a new fork yes slightly deflating the tires would increase the smoothness of your right but may cause damage to the rims if you deflate them too much also you might try to find a softer seat the gel ones are pretty nice but yeah i usually stand up on the petals when i go off a curb on my bmx bike so it isn't so bad  Mountain bike Bicycle Motorcycle Tire Bicycle frame Bicycle brake systems Car handling Mountain biking Deflation (economics) Racing bicycle Honda CX series Mouse (computing) Mattress Cycling Motocross BMW motorcycles Theory of conduct Shock absorber Bicycle wheel Bicycle lighting Horse Recumbent bicycle Bicycle helmet Equine conformation Toyota MR2 Bike lane debate Lamborghini Diablo Gross domestic product Suspension (vehicle) Honda Prelude Chevrolet Corvair Inertial guidance system Segregated cycle facilities Automobile Chopper (motorcycle) Snowboarding Wood The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Hiberno-English Lance Armstrong Tank Bike trials riding Cyclo-cross Knife Truth Caterpillar track Stryker Bus rapid transit Drag racing Single-speed bicycle Explosive material Inflation Plastic Mountain bike racing Road transport Horse gait All-terrain vehicle Mazda RX-7 Upholstery Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Pickup truck Battery (electricity) Snowboard Paragliding Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Mercedes-Benz A-Class Thread (computer science) Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 Suspension bridge Psoriasis Dodge Charger High-heeled shoe Tofu Drill bit Chevrolet Camaro Strap-on dildo Guilty Gear Arthur Laffer Passenger car Toyota Prius Fire fighting Bomberman Land Rover (Series/Defender) Polyurethane Carpal tunnel syndrome Vehicular cycling Poker jargon Skateboard Schwinn Bicycle Company Philosophy of space and time Floppy disk Hubert H.

whats with bicycle groups clubs riding their bikes in the middle of the road i thought if they are supposed to go single file on major roads one of these days they're going to cause an accident then no one will be alloewed to ride on the road anymore i think they must have their spandex to tight or they are just inconsiderate the actual answer to your question is rooted in the psychology of group vs individual behavior also known as mob mentality a single cyclist will not ride down the center of the road because it will piss off motorists who will direct of their anger them it's also far more dangerous for the single cyclist that same person however will feel empowered within a group of other cyclists to usurp the road and do stupid things so your question boils down to why do people behave stupidly in the group first there is safety in numbers nobody can yell at just one cyclist if have taken over the road so the burden for personal responsibility is lessened when people can blame it on others or say everyone else is doing it that safety in numbers makes otherwise sensible people justify many types of inappropriate behavior even if that behavior is counter to the rules of self preservation now take the group dynamic i've just described and apply it to a typical cycling club anywhere in america they are mostly white middle aged middle to upper middle class cycling to them is a recreational hobby and not an athletic pursuit we've known them as posers yuppies on carbon and garden variety narcissists riding abreast gives them a chance to talk about their favorite subject themselves now what better venue could there be for a lycra preening narcissist than strutting down the center of the road where everyone has to acknowledge your very presence and existence functionally speaking anything beyond a single paceline is just stupid and dangerous keep the rubber side down  Bike lane debate Bicycle Segregated cycle facilities Bicycle helmet Cycling Narcissism Motorcycle Vehicular cycling Critical Mass Mountain biking Social psychology Scientology beliefs and practices Psychology Effective Cycling Bicycle lighting Track cycling Cycle path debate Recumbent bicycle Utility cycling Microeconomics Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Bicycle frame Traumatic brain injury Karen Horney Autism Lance Armstrong Human sexual behavior Neuro-linguistic programming Theory of conduct Bipolar disorder Driving Altruism Asperger syndrome Domestic violence Narcissistic personality disorder A Course In Miracles Milton H.

what dont we like about electric bikes or electric motorbikes thinking about setting up a company selling electric bikes and motorbikes for on and off road use what do you think yes there are some really cool electric bikes out there they can get almost miles range and can leave most bicyclists in the dust but so what no one is really making a living selling them i support the industry and build one for a customer every now and then there are maybe a whole ten shops in the usa making enough money to support the owner full time and they are in really big cities you need to be good at electronics retailing bicycling and business there just is not enough sales money to support that effort its is hard enough making a living owning a regular bike shop it just does not work for ebikes in the us yet for many folks europe seems to love them but it is flatter with lots of bike paths even though beta was a better video recording format it did not catch on that's business  Mountain bike Utility cycling Sears Holdings Corporation Bicycle lighting Harley-Davidson Retailer Mountain biking Cycling UK Singles Chart Bicycle brake systems Honda Honda CX series Wal-Mart Electronic commerce Segregated cycle facilities Roller skating Schwinn Bicycle Company Grand Theft Auto (game) Bicycle Microsoft Tesco Beastie Boys Videocassette recorder Bulk vending London Congestion Charge Best Buy Jennifer Lopez Triathlon Marks & Spencer Epoxy Jeff Bezos Vehicular cycling Delaware, Ohio Bike lane debate Bicycle helmet Track cycling Transportation of Los Angeles Tire Amway The Chemical Brothers Privatization A-ha Credit card Dancing at Lughnasa Ballwin, Missouri Beverly Hills, California Eaton's Intellectual property Amazon.com Panasonic Publishing Toyota Prius DVD Queen (band) Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII Eugene, Oregon Spice Girls Commodore International Bank Pattaya International Computers Ltd Coffeehouse Cranford, New Jersey Nintendo DS Automobile Battery electric vehicle PolyGram Lance Armstrong ITunes Music Store Thomas B.

why do bmxs have only one gear and weigh so much can i put more cogs on it please bmx bikes have one gear because they are intended for short duration efforts or stunt riding in these cases a system of gears doesn't help and in most cases it's just something else to break the reason for the weight is that they have to be tough to handle the abuse of jumping and crashing a lightweight frame and wheels will fold or beak under this type of stress you often find bmx stunt wheels with spokes retrofitting a derailleur system on a single speed bike isn't impossible but probably isn't worth the time money and hassle you would need a new rear wheel with a mutli cog freewheel or freehub and cassette a bolt on derailleur hanger a rear derailleur cableing a shifter mechanism the time and experience to put it all together and make it work your better off buying a geared bike at least then when you break it by trying bmx stunts you can get replacement parts  Bicycle Derailleur gears Bicycle brake systems Fixed-gear bicycle Motorcycle Bicycle frame Hub gear BMX Single-speed bicycle Shifter (bicycle part) Racing bicycle Recumbent bicycle Honda CX series Shimano Total Integration Shimano Motocross Gear Cycling Unicycle Jackass: The Movie Manual transmission Evel Knievel Bicycle wheel Bicycle helmet Stunt Chevrolet Corvair Porsche 911 Poker jargon Rear wheel drive Cyclo-cross Car handling Tank Four wheel drive Bicycle lighting Mazda Miata Lawn mower Cessna T-37 BMX racing Automobile Locomotive Radio controlled airplane Elevator M16 (rifle) VHS Dodge Neon Equine conformation Citro__n 2CV Honda Prelude Axle Heinkel He 100 Rail terminology Cog railway Kart racing M60 machine gun Heinkel He 112 Novelty (locomotive) Land Rover (Series/Defender) Mount Washington Cog Railway Lance Armstrong Freewheel Glossary of partner dance terms Transfer case Track bicycle Hybrid vehicle Tandem bicycle Roller chain Emergency brake Wind turbine Knife Parachute Drag racing Mat Hoffman Toyota MR2 Dodge Charger Krag-J__rgensen Anchor Passenger car Messerschmitt Bf 109 Wheel of Fortune Touring bicycle Steering Front wheel drive Acura Integra (North America) Ford Mustang Penny-farthing Bubble Bobble Chopper (motorcycle) View camera Airbag Honda S2000 Phonograph Land Rover Discovery Tire Mouse (computing)

have you ever taught an adult to ride a pedal bike do you have any tips or advice no i haven't but here's my cents use a smaller comfortable bike that's easy to ride use a quiet street or parking lot for room and smooth surface no spectators to intimidate patience and encouragement competent teacher that is trusted stress staying centered on the bike sounds obvious but its not to a beginner get the student up to mph or so asap the faster you go the easier to balance beginners want to go slow but that in itself makes balance difficult good luck  Bicycle Bicycle frame Mountain bike Equine conformation Honda CX series Motorcycle Mountain biking Radio controlled airplane Irish dance Tai Chi Chuan Oh My Goddess!

buying a new bicycle hello i am thinking seriously about buying a new bike and i want to educate myself before i make any decisions i enjoy both road and mountain biking i currently have a trek mountain bike but the front fork is pretty much shot i am also a triathlete and i bike miles to work sometimes so a road bike would be very nice i can only afford one bike i can maybe fix up the trek what kind of a road bike or hybrid should i look into my budget is about yes i do triathlons with a mountain bike i live in colorado so it is not that strange it is the reason i want a road bike though mountain bikes are jsut so slow i would vouch for buying a road bike however i would suggest supporting your local bicycle shop lbs so you have a resource when you need to get your bike tuned and such however is a very tight budget for a new bike you might consider a used bike or replacing the front fork of your existing bike as well as your tires replacing them with smooth city commuting tires the main advantages of the road bike are the handlebars which have more hand positions so your hands and arms do not go numb from having too much weight on them in the same position for too long in addition you will increase your top speed and average speed by having a more aerodynamic position at speeds above mph wind resistance swamps out all other factors rolling resistance drivetrain inefficiencies etc road bikes tend to be less weight this also helps reduce the power required the biggest things to get used to between road bikes and mountain bikes are the thinner wheels and tires which further decreases the amount of power required by decreasing the rotational inertia and assuming you have knobby tires on the mountain bike significantly less rolling resistance getting used to looking out for more pavement defects and debris can be a harsh learning experience when first starting on road bikes  Triathlon Recumbent bicycle Racing bicycle Bicycle frame Bicycle brake systems Mountain biking Bicycle lighting Bicycle wheel Car handling Bike lane debate Tire Cycling Cyclo-cross Motocross Helicopter Utility cycling Single-speed bicycle Toyota Prius Hybrid vehicle Track cycling Fixed-gear bicycle Microeconomics Sport utility vehicle Jet engine Segregated cycle facilities Vehicular cycling Automobile Drag racing Bicycle helmet TGV Internal ballistics Four wheel drive Lance Armstrong Transportation of Los Angeles Schwinn Bicycle Company Formula One cars Derailleur gears Radio controlled airplane Chopper (motorcycle) BMX Mattress Supply and demand Sailing Porsche 911 Stryker 24 Hours of Le Mans Terminal ballistics Electric motor Wind power Honda CX series Fast bowling B-47 Stratojet Poker jargon Welding Personal rapid transit Penny-farthing Space Shuttle program Grand Prix motorcycle racing Aluminium Wood Headlight Chevrolet Corvair Carburetor Climbing specialist (cycling) M16 (rifle) Turbocharger Indianapolis 500 All-terrain vehicle Tractor Mass Public transport Toyota MR2 Law of value Heinkel He 112 Boston and Lowell Railroad Trail NASCAR BMW Formula One Panzer I Shifter (bicycle part) Swimming Bicycling terminology Douglas DC-8 Speed limit Battery electric vehicle Carbon fiber Rolling-element bearing Torque

what is the difference between a fitness and bike and a road bike i am a regular mountain biker but like to road ride too however my full suspension is way too much drama for the pavement and even my hardtail is too heavy for efficient road travel i want something lighter and better suited the problem is i am not super fond of the feel of road bikes i saw that trek my fave had fitness bikes and urban bikes and i am wondering if anyone can tell me what are the advantages disadvantages to choosing a fitness or urban bike over a road bike thanks just to add a fitness bike is not a stationary bike it is an actual style of bicycle like urban road mountain triathalon etc i was just hoping that someone had some info on what might be better suited for me thanks to anyone who can help okay here goes a road bike is a race inspired design it has you in an attack position the whole time regardless of how you place your hands on the bars the frames are much lighter than mtbs and the tires are much thinner as well obvious what is not completely obvious is the change in the riding position the seatpost is higher and the stems hb is positioned so that you are more erect but arched forward as well the hybrids aka fitness bikes urban bikes are basically a mixture of mtb and road bikes they are using the geometry of mtb but the concepts ideals of a road bike the wheels on a hybrid are cc which is similar to a road bike but the tire size is actually a little bit wider and thicker instead of it is the riding position is similar to that of a mtb with a little more relaxed feeling and not an attack position the components actually go both ways some models have mtb components while some have road bike components that depends however on how high of a model you get some also have carbon fiber distributed throughout the frame fork while others are fully rigid sometimes you'll find a suspension seatpost but on fitness bikes it is usually a rigid fork weight wise the hybrids range from lbs but are actually surprisingly fast trek giant specialized cannondale and a couple others all offer hybrids now pros hybrids are cheaper and have the same basic concept of getting from point a to point b quickly but comfortably but still a nice ride to work out with the geometry is very similar to a mtb faster than mtb not much maintenance required if you take care of it cons not as light as a road bike components can be cheapy if not purchasing a good model can be as expensive as road bikes if purchasing a good model i have both mtb's and road bikes and i love both i just love to ride regardless of what bike it is however there is a huge difference between the two if you just want to get from point a to point b i say get a hybrid if you want a cardio work out and get huge legs get a road bike it took me a while to break down and buy a road bike i owned only mtbs for years but decided to finally give it a shot after starting to work at a bike shop i like both but nothing beats mtbs go to a dealer and try them both out hybrids and road bikes ride it for a while and see if you can see yourself getting comfortable on a road bike if not your choice is pretty much made up if so well questions questions questions and price price price good luck mate  Bicycle brake systems Bicycle lighting Cycling Recumbent bicycle Sport utility vehicle Car handling Tire Utility cycling Cannondale Bicycle Corporation Jet engine Equine conformation Mattress M16 (rifle) Single-speed bicycle Strap-on dildo Dodge Charger Tank Loudspeaker Microeconomics Schwinn Bicycle Company Honda CX series Toyota MR2 Space elevator Chopper (motorcycle) Bike lane debate Cyclo-cross Triathlon Bicycle helmet Carbon fiber Automobile Radio controlled airplane Hybrid vehicle Toyota Camry Bicycle wheel Drill bit 24 Hours of Le Mans Floppy disk Wind turbine Chevrolet Corvette Floyd Rose Porsche 911 CPU design Diesel engine Public transport Aluminium Anchor Specialized Bicycle Components Turbocharger Toyota Prius M4 Sherman Gas metal arc welding Vehicular cycling Golf club (equipment) Trail Personal rapid transit Badminton Airsoft Luminiferous aether Pickup truck Mitsubishi 3000GT Douglas DC-8 Motocross Chevrolet Corvair Panzer II Ford Thunderbird Ford Ranger EV Heinkel He 112 Guitar Battery electric vehicle BMW Digital photography Tiger I Rear wheel drive Radio controlled car Laserdisc Pebble bed reactor T-72 Species Segregated cycle facilities

will i ever get over the difficultness of riding a bike my husband and i ride miles a day almost every day the road neighborhoods we ride in are pretty hilly i can do miles in minutes so we keep a pretty good pace my husband can ride circles around me and he is years older than me it kills me to think that i can hardly keep up i have allergies and he doesnt seem to think that this should hinder my riding i think it is a contributing factor to my difficulties in riding my pelvic bone is always sore even with padded seats and bike shorts i am trying to toughen up am i just being a wimp i can work out in the gym and get this exhuasted he just seems to think that i am not trying hard enough if i try any harder i will vomit come on no one likes to do that i have been known to do that and continue to ride but that just isnt right is it ideas although he says once i overcome my difficulties with the course he will take me on longer level rides do you think this is the better course for me sorry i forgot to add that i am riding a nice trek moutain bike with tires for road and dirt cant remember the size or model but it was sized for me i do remember that to add more imformation as was pointed out to me i forgot to put what type of bike i ride a nice trek moutain bike it has road dirt tires on it it was fitted for me cycling is hard work you didn't mention what kind of bike you were riding as far as your pelvic bone hurting it could be the seat itself or the seat is not in the right position most bike shops these days have a pro on hand that can make adjustments to your bike to make it much more comfortable as far as being exhausted you might be riding in the wrong gears try these ideas when going up hills have the chain in the smallest chain ring in the front and one of the two biggest in the back when riding flat terrain have the chain in the smallest or middle chain ring in the front and one of the middle three gears in back when riding down hill have the chain in the biggest chain ring in front and one of the smallest gears in the back and always be in the right gear just before you know you are going to need it this will help keep the momentum also try to keep your rpm in the to range do this the same way you check your heart rate count the number of pedal strokes you make with your right pedal for seconds then multiply by your right pedal should make revolutions in seconds if it doesn't shift to an easier gear in the back until you can stay in that range if none of this works by a moped then tell your husband he's going to slow  Bicycle Motorcycle Recumbent bicycle Mountain bike Bicycle frame Equine conformation Bicycle brake systems Lance Armstrong Triathlon Manual transmission Motocross Spinning (cycling) Bike lane debate Drag racing Mattress Snowboarding Car handling Skateboarding trick Fast bowling Tire Tour de France Honda CX series Weight training BMX Transmission (mechanics) Racing bicycle 2000 Australian Grand Prix De Lorean DMC-12 Prostate cancer First aid Helicopter Strap-on dildo All-terrain vehicle Timpani Vehicular cycling Fixed-gear bicycle Indianapolis 500 Toyota Prius Engine displacement RuneScape quests Guilty Gear Aerial (dance move) Bon Jovi Stage (bicycle race) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Violin Toyota Land Cruiser Drifting (motorsport) Tractor Kitesurfing B-47 Stratojet Adventure racing 24 Hours of Le Mans Poker jargon Grade (climbing) Diving Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Lighting Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Bicycle helmet Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Cyclo-cross Dodge Neon CPU cache GunBound Theory of conduct Hey Jude Ed, Edd n Eddy Dance Dance Revolution Mercedes-Benz A-Class Utility cycling Derailleur gears Inflation Harley-Davidson W.

how can i re gear my bike i have a base mountain bike with gripshift and rear gears it only has the one front sprocket i would like to change this to 'quickfire' shifters and put on front sprockets what would be the best way of doing this thank you if this bike was bought at a wal mart k mart or other big box store don't spend any additional money on it you are not looking at the bigger picture for starters when changing out your crank and shifters you will probably also have to buy a new front and rear derailleur as well this will cost more than the bike you currently have and then some a decent mountain bike is going to cost you or more keep riding the bike you have now till you have at least that much saved up then go to the local bike shop and find the bike you really want you may have to save some more cash after that visit for the one you really want but it will be worth it in the end a good bike can last you years depending on what kind of riding you're doing and how well you take care of it  Derailleur gears Bicycle Transmission (mechanics) Mountain bike Bicycle frame Recumbent bicycle Racing bicycle Wal-Mart Honda CX series Cycling Bicycle brake systems Fixed-gear bicycle Bicycle lighting Kart racing Penny-farthing Single-speed bicycle Bike trials riding Triathlon Motocross Mountain biking Hub gear Manual transmission MapleStory Shimano Total Integration Gear Snowboarding Whistler-Blackcomb Inflation Mazda Miata Automobile Transfer case Sears Holdings Corporation Cyclo-cross Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Bike lane debate Paintball Unicycle Bicycle commuting Roller chain Bicycle wheel Lance Armstrong Adventure racing Bank Hybrid vehicle Citro__n 2CV Tandem bicycle $ale of the Century Drag racing Jackass: The Movie Hyperinflation Surveillance Bottom bracket Tour de France Microeconomics Jennifer Lopez Best Buy Dodge Neon Daylight saving time Vehicular cycling Heinkel He 100 BMW motorcycles Mercury Cougar Volkswagen Type 2 Paramount Pictures Tax Octopus card Cruising (maritime) Bon Jovi Cable television Specialized Bicycle Components Touring bicycle Money Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Wheel of Fortune 2005 World Series John Bull (locomotive) Burning Man Gambling BMW Steering Caterpillar track Monopoly (game) Toyota Celica Continuously variable transmission BMX Life insurance Berkshire Hathaway Capital accumulation Rail terminology John F.

numb fingers over the weekend i rode close to miles during the ride i noticed that my left ring and pinky fingers were beginning to get a little numb i tried shaking it off but the feeling persisted now two days later these fingers still feel a little weak and slightly numb could it be that my gloves are too tight or something else fairly common try to change hand positions frequently so you're not putting weight on the same pressure points the whole ride if you have a road bike change from hoods to drops and back i have aerobars so that is another option for me if you have a mountain bike get the short bar extensions for a change of position it looks a little odd but you could even put aerobars on an mtb if you wanted another position  Professional wrestling holds Recumbent bicycle Equine conformation Skateboarding trick Mountain bike Double bass Car handling Bicycle Carpal tunnel syndrome Mountain biking Internal ballistics Valentino Rossi Poker jargon The Hitch-Hiker (The Twilight Zone) Hand Harp Glossary of American football Tenshinhan Horizontal bar Anchor Glossary of partner dance terms Motorcycle Traumatic brain injury Vehicular cycling Triathlon Strap-on dildo Gesture Milton H.

recommendates for paths sites for biking through the loire valley france would like to find scenic and moderate to leisurely routes to do over the course of a week any recommendations i don't know if you need accommodation and bike rentals etc but i've found the logis de france website to provide some good information they offer 'short breaks' based on various themes including cycling the will arrange everything for you accommodation bikes route maps etc i think most of their cycle trips are self guided you'll know where you start where you end and your route each day but you cycle on your own you're not part of a large group they even arrange to transfer any luggage from one hotel to the next i have taken advantage of a couple of their cycle breaks over the last couple of years and found them to be great value for the money if you don't need the whole package you can at least get a good idea of destinations on their website you can also get some very good and detailed maps from the french 'institut geographique national' at their website available in english  Bicycle touring Utility cycling Segregated cycle facilities Mountain biking Cycling Tour de France Triathlon CPU cache Bike lane debate Yosemite National Park Long Path Hospitality service Bicycle lighting Bryce Canyon National Park Eugene, Oregon Bicycle British Columbia Public transport Vehicular cycling Tung Chung Extreme Programming National Football League Barbados Tourism Swansea Google Maps GED Tourism in Hawaii Airport EasyJet Trail Sustrans Anchorage, Alaska Julian day Hong Kong International Airport London 2012 Olympic bid Internet fraud National Weather Service Recumbent bicycle Motorcycle Monopoly (game) Telephone exchange Ootacamund BMW Guadalupe Mountains National Park Port Authority Trans-Hudson EuroVelo Grand Forks, North Dakota Effective Cycling Loire River National Scenic Byway Traffic sign Taff Trail Bournemouth TGV Dead Like Me Playoff Zion National Park Deflation (economics) Sydney Riot of 1879 Adventure racing Transportation of Los Angeles Asynchronous Transfer Mode GSM services San Fernando City, Pampanga Link-state routing protocol Puerto de la Cruz, Santa Cruz de Tenerife Road bicycle racing Airline Dorking Bicycle commuting Thermal power station Routing Cambridge, Massachusetts United States Postal Service PNG Leasing RuneScape cheats City and Guilds of London Institute Personal rapid transit Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Auto Train (Amtrak) Adelboden Appalachian Trail Ridge Route Lance Armstrong Shimano College Union Cycliste Internationale Legal research Boise, Idaho San Francisco Municipal Railway Glossary of graph theory Cycle path debate League of American Bicyclists FidoNet Cork Ryanair

why do bicycle chains pop off is there any reason why this would keep happening the chain can't be too long i had to stop and put it back on track like times time for a new bicycle or can this bike be saved it can certainly be saved and is happening because of bad adjustment if this is a single speed bike the chain is coming off because there is too much slack in the chain allowing it to come off under pressure to fix this you would have to tighten the chainline by moving the rear wheel backward in the dropout if this is a multi speed bike it is happening because the derailleurs usually the front are not probably limiting the travel of the chain a bike store can fix this in a matter of seconds  Bicycle Bicycle frame Derailleur gears Mountain bike Motorcycle Vehicular cycling Transmission (mechanics) Hub gear Shifter (bicycle part) Bicycle lighting Bike lane debate Tire Steering Bottom bracket Triathlon Bicycle chain Cycling Transportation of Los Angeles Touring bicycle Penny-farthing Car handling Time travel Drag racing Shimano Bicycle wheel Spacecraft propulsion Volleyball Moped Utility cycling Differential (mechanics) Chess terminology Formula One regulations Helicopter View camera BMX Equine conformation Sailing Skateboarding trick Motocross Cyclo-cross TGV Bike trials riding Track cycling Motorcycle helmet Mercedes-Benz A-Class Bicycle helmet Formula One cars Roller skating Road bicycle racing Manual transmission Horse gait Schwinn Bicycle Company Floyd Rose Rail terminology The Jesus and Mary Chain Honda CX series Continuously variable transmission Mario Kart 64 Anchor Automobile IPod NASCAR Speed of light Rail tracks Mountain biking Tandem bicycle Tank Spinning (cycling) Jet engine Solar car Loudspeaker Professional wrestling holds Hard disk Glossary of American football Isetta Netfilter/iptables Traffic Roller chain Mountain bike racing Automatic number plate recognition Internal ballistics Time Valentino Rossi Mouse (computing) Gear ratio Semi-trailer Universal Serial Bus Drifting (motorsport) 2005-06 A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Great Britain Railway signalling Timpani B-47 Stratojet Utility bicycle Autogyro

what is the best type of bike for city riding and what kind of bike would you recommend i buy i don't really have the money to replace my bike but i will be using it every day soon and i want to have something road worthy i may start looking for used but i need help deciding what to look for i like need a comfort saddle like the kind you find on specialized comfort bikes i like to lean forward a bit not ride in upright position i ride in the city on pavement that is smooth but for they occasional crack or bump sometimes i ride hard and i desire performance i use my bike for exercise and less often transportation though that may be changing i enjoy my current ride a cheap specialized hybrid comfort mountain but it's kind of boring not enough balls i might say specific models would be great but keep the msrp under not enough balls i might say then you are looking for a road bike if your tendency to lean forward over the bars is pronounced enough then you will find the 'drop' racing type handlebars should suit your riding better than the more upright hybrid style which are in essence much like those for touring and commuting be sure to determine what your correct frame size is for a road bike there is no substitute for going to a bicycle shop and having some hands on help for this if you are in the process of shopping around you can ask for this sort of assistance without the obligation to buy be sure to engage them fully and give them a chance to show you their bikes they deserve your attention even if you are sure that you are not quite yet ready to buy you will learn from all of this so don't shortchange yourself here your budget may require looking for a deal on a quality used road bike as is usually slightly below a good new entry level model and the parts from your current bicycle cannot simply be switched over onto a new or used road frame however there are several models of new bicycles available at this level also ride quality is a consideration aluminum frames are lighter but undeniably a bit harsher and less forgiving of road shock if you are not serious about racing you may find that a good steel framed bicycle suits you better after all even for exercise discomfort will affect motivation and make your riding less enjoyable you did not mention whether you prefer to keep your current bicycle if you can sell your current bike and add the proceeds to your budget then at to some decent road bicycle models become feasible also in one month many dealers will start looking to clear out inventory as the peak summer season ends don't overlook this you can save to if you buy at the right time that said for a basic road bicycle with a good ride and a price that can't be beat from a good manufacturer try the jamis ventura sport which at msrp 'street' is the lowest price for a decent road bicycle that isn't no name when buying a bicycle keep in mind that while you can upgrade the components over time replacing a frame usually means replacing a bike so your wisest purchase is for a better frame with lesser components as opposed to the other way around there are 'overstock' discounted prices a bit cheaper that can be dug up on deals which you can find on the 'net for 'off brand' bikes but not where you can go into a shop and test ride one spending a bit more does get you more you should at least try test riding a steel bike to feel how it rides one bicycle that has received glowing reviews for ride quality is the jamis satellite msrp 'street' price bianchi's brava is worth mentioning here with a steel frame and msrp of sorry it's those exchange rates pushing this one up a bit 'street' price will be less in aluminum framed bicycles examples of good models to look for include the jamis ventura comp msrp 'street' and the specialized allez msrp 'street' the basic not the elite or sport a good deal will bring this one down into your price range trek's entry in this range is the an alpha model msrp 'street' a good bicycle purchase will remind you of how good or bad it is every ride for years the time and effort expended here is well worth it  Mountain biking Microeconomics Bicycle lighting Poker jargon Equine

how much should a bike tune up cost how long should it take and what should it include any tips or advice on getting good service and making sure they did everything they were supposed to also how often should you tune your bike assuming you put less than a miles a year on it i just got my bike tuned for which included pickup delivery and a new brake cable the chain had been having problems so it was removed and then reset on the derailer the tire spokes were straightened and aligned the tires were pumped up with air and the brakes were tightened and fixed the tension on the click gear settings was adjusted call your local bike shops and ask who does great bike tuneups they should be able to quote you a basic price plus the cost of any parts you may need to replace most technicians are pretty passionate about bicycles and happy to explain what they recommend fixing and why as for tuneup frequency ask the technician what he recommends and then use your best judgement based on how your bike is working your bicycle chain would probably also benefit from regular grease maintenance  Bicycle Motorcycle Mountain bike Bicycle brake systems Fixed-gear bicycle Cycling Derailleur gears Tire Bicycle frame Recumbent bicycle Bicycle lighting Wind turbine Violin Honda CX series Floyd Rose Shifter (bicycle part) Shimano Oscilloscope Disc brake Mountain biking Guitar Anchor Utility cycling Chevrolet Corvair Automobile Utility bicycle Bicycle helmet B-47 Stratojet Single-speed bicycle TGV Carburetor Public transport Hub gear Microeconomics Cruising (maritime) Law of value Locomotive Extreme Programming Transformer Bike trials riding Triathlon Bike lane debate Personal rapid transit Boeing 777 BMX Vietnam Airlines Broadband Internet access Electric guitar Schwinn Bicycle Company PID controller E85 Mattress Segregated cycle facilities Inflation Bicycle wheel Transportation of Los Angeles Heinkel He 100 Glossary of firefighting equipment Transmission (mechanics) Timpani Ford Mustang Information Technology Infrastructure Library Phonograph Economics Embedded system Dodge Neon Harmonica Motocross Plastic IPod M16 (rifle) Car handling Hash table Atari 8-bit family Heinkel He 112 Space elevator Hybrid vehicle Cable television Bottom bracket Airbus A320 Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 Spinning (cycling) Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Drag racing Track cycling Theory of conduct Lamborghini Diablo Expert system Motor oil Shimano Total Integration Elevator Spoke R46 (New York City Subway car) Mutual fund Spark plug Wind power Touring bicycle Piano

best bicycle for the street i want a bike for short distances within a mile or so and won't need to carry anything i am petite just shy of five feet so it needs to be adjustable to a low height good suggestions so far also my price limit is hopefully i can get something good from your description it sounds like you are not doing any serious riding but using the bike for transportation i definitely agree with the suggestions you have received to go to a good local bike shop talk with them about what you want and what type of riding you will be doing based on the information you gave i would suggest a bicycle something like the townie by electra it is a bit like a cruiser with an upright seat position which will give you more comfort and ability to see around you they have also what they call flat foot design you can sit on the seat and your feet can be flat on the ground minimal worries about tipping over etc they are not real expensive and are reliable my wife has one she is just about your height there are other manufacturers that make similar bikes your bike shop should be able to help below is the website for electra's townie bike  Bicycle Recumbent bicycle Bicycle frame Motorcycle Bicycle brake systems Bicycle lighting Mountain biking Equine conformation Cycling Utility cycling Anchor Single-speed bicycle Bike lane debate BMX Drill bit Racing bicycle Segregated cycle facilities Dog agility Tire Bicycle helmet Honda CX series Cyclo-cross Vancouver B-47 Stratojet Wind turbine Skateboarding trick Public transport Snowboarding Tricycle Car handling Vehicular cycling Personal rapid transit Mattress Space elevator Bicycle touring Disney's California Adventure Trail Yacht Bike trials riding Teletext Chopper (motorcycle) Double bass Law of value Harley-Davidson Transportation of Los Angeles Bass guitar Triathlon Cruising (maritime) Volleyball BMW Windsurfing Tour de France Adventure racing Triumph Motorcycles Washington Monument Hubert Opperman Cambridge, Massachusetts Bottom bracket Schwinn Bicycle Company Oscilloscope Radar Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Airsoft Toyota Land Cruiser Gross domestic product Douglas DC-8 Whistler-Blackcomb Horse Strap-on dildo Fixed-gear bicycle Sport rowing TGV Stereoscopy Chair Urban sprawl Touring bicycle Pole vault Cannondale Bicycle Corporation Sport utility vehicle Welding Fast bowling Motorcycle helmet All-terrain vehicle British Columbia Air New Zealand Gas metal arc welding Binoculars Snowboard Land Rover (Series/Defender) Poker jargon View camera Headlight Delaware, Ohio Wright brothers Star Destroyer Royal Enfield Bicycle commuting

is this a good workout for every week i'm about to go into high school and during this summer i have been cycling once or even twice a day i do this mile cycling route which is hilly and downhill and it would take my about minutes to finish it i do this twice once in the morning and one in the afternoon the other days i do miles and most of the routes have steep hills that would take minutes and rest is just flat is this a good workout routine for my age that's pretty good for a year old depending on your goals you might want to step up the time and distance if you're just riding because you enjoy it keep up the good work the only thing i would suggest would be to look into local cycling clubs you'll meet with people who have more experience can show you new routes etc if you're looking to keep fit for some sports at school what you're doing now is just fine the coach in whatever sport you may be considering can give you better advice at what activities to concentrate on but riding for an hour a day will only help if you have any aspirations at becoming a competitive cyclist it's time to start thinking about working on your endurance again hooking up with a local club is your best bet think about long rides once a week at your age you don't want to over do it and by that i mean hours in length maybe longer depending on how flat the route is you shouldn't be thinking about setting personal speed records on these rides but you do want to make it hard enough to be considered a workout at and average speed of mph is good for a hilly hour ride  Triathlon Weight training Recumbent bicycle Marathon (sport) Gliding Bicycle Equine conformation Ironman Triathlon Climbing specialist (cycling) Norway national football team Time Mountain biking Cycling in Melbourne Cross-country skiing Individual time trial Exercise Track cycling Extreme Programming Sport Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Bicycle lighting 24 Hours of Le Mans Mountaineering Bicycle helmet Sauna Squash (sport) Interstate Highway Hebrew calendar Bicycle frame Indian Railways USS Tunny (SS-282) Skiing Eddy Merckx Auto racing Daylight saving time Parachuting Football (soccer) Electrophysiology Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Troms__ I.L.

are you alowwed to ride your bike on side walks or di you have to ride them in the break down lane you're best off consulting your states laws many states disallow sidewalk riding above a certain age in ca is the maximum breakdown lane that term usually only applies to limited access roads which prohibit bicycles if you mean shoulder it depends on the state a few states require riding on the shoulder but nearly all allow use of the lane as long as traffic flow is not impeded in addition because of the debris glass trees that are on the sidewalk riding in the lane is safer rear end collisions are quite rare except on rural highways at night that is interpreted that when there are or more vehicles behind you one should pull off at the next safe place and then reenter the traffic flow  Bike lane debate Vehicular cycling Segregated cycle facilities Freeway Lane Traffic light Speed limit Transportation of Los Angeles Rules of the road Traffic Road safety Interstate Highway Motorway Public transport High-occupancy vehicle Hard shoulder Hitchhiking Reversible lane Sidewalk Roundabout Trail Road Dual carriageway Road traffic accident Bicycle lighting Interstate Highway standards Escalator Autobahn Cycle path debate Street Effective Cycling Critical Mass Traffic calming Curb extension Recumbent bicycle Bicycle helmet Sydney Harbour Bridge Jaywalking Utility cycling Sport utility vehicle Bicycle brake systems Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Big Dig Equine conformation Lechaina Interstate 75 School bus Jingjintang Expressway California Highway Patrol International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea Milpitas, California Car safety Cycling Mountain biking Professional wrestling throws Driver's license Road transport Level crossing Airport Drag racing Sailing Tour de France California State Route 110 California State Route 85 Interstate 94 Traffic engineering (transportation) Warning sign Contraflow lane reversal Toll road Super-2 California State Route 1 Motorized bicycle Headlight Tire Bicycle frame Michigan left Tsing Ma Bridge Seat belt Bus accident at Carrollton, Kentucky in 1988 Murray River crossings Elevator West Side Highway Motorcycle helmet Racing bicycle Pedestrian crossing Mountain bike Triathlon Crash test dummy Siphon Colonial Parkway 400-Series Highways Bus rapid transit Moped Automobile Automatic number plate recognition

how do you break in your butt so that you can ride a bike for more than minutes without pain short of actually riding longer and more frequently to get your body used to it i'd suggest the following if you're experiencing pain after just five minutes you may want to look into a very different bike seat or look into some biking pants or both each week i ride a road bicycle over miles miles of which are done in one sitting as it were i wear proper bike shorts with chamois padding in the butt and crotch area and i have a standard race bike seat which is thinner in height than that of a mountain bike hybrid or cruiser it's also possible that your seat is too low relative to your bike size handlebar height and your physical dimensions the result would be that you are putting far too much pressure on the nerves in your groin butt area and therefore causing discomfort for simplicity and ease's sake try one or all of the ideas i listed above otherwise i'd suggest going to a proper bike shop and have them fit you on your bike hope this helps  Bicycle Recumbent bicycle Bicycle frame Mountain bike Motorcycle Bicycle brake systems Mountain biking Triathlon Cycling Crash test dummy Tour de France Bicycle helmet Undergarment Traumatic brain injury Cyclo-cross Racing bicycle Jackass: The Movie Bicycle lighting Equine conformation Lance Armstrong Professional wrestling holds Track cycling Utility cycling Strap-on dildo Urinary incontinence Mattress Single-speed bicycle Hubert Opperman Mixed martial arts British Columbia Myocardial infarction Jan Ullrich Climbing specialist (cycling) Bike trials riding Tide Crested Butte, Colorado Tire Bike lane debate Rockers Welding Pain Chamois Road bicycle racing Whistler-Blackcomb Eddy Merckx Chopper (motorcycle) Derailleur gears Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Aerial (dance move) Milton H.

are the carrera bikes at halfords any good i ride mostly on the road but like to go offroad sometimes no they don't offer good quality and they don't sell bikes for good price most of the prices have been brought up then they mislead the customers by saying half price or one third off all these are lies if you really want a good bike but don't want to pay for the full price the best thing for you to do is go online and check out bikes which are out of season i e last year versions or clearance you need to spend a decent amount of money on a bike because cheap bike bad for your money in the long run and you don't enjoy riding it plus eventually you need to buy another one  Bicycle lighting Mountain biking Mountain bike Sport utility vehicle Gross domestic product Bike lane debate Motorcycle Mutual fund Price discrimination Deflation (economics) Microeconomics Cycling RuneScape economy Public good Social Credit Porsche 911 Short selling Craps Internet fraud Enron Corporation Retailer FairTax Dot-com Agricultural policy Supply and demand Law of value Arbitrage Hyperinflation PE ratio Bicycle Inflation Illegal drug trade Health insurance Billboard Hot 100 Micropayment Cyclo-cross Capitalism You Don't Know Jack Tesco Outsourcing Bond Surtees Valentino Rossi Sports betting Commodity Bicycle brake systems Recumbent bicycle Public transport MMORPG ITunes Music Store GunZ The Duel Pickup truck Gold standard Atari 8-bit family Tariff Mercedes-Benz Paintball Ethical consumerism Islamic banking Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Poker jargon Mattress Denis Law Electronic commerce Monopoly (game) Keynesian economics Racing bicycle Arguments for and against drug prohibition Tax Babylonian law Leeds United F.C.
