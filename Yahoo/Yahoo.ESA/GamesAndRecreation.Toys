i ask again what is the point over a doll i hate people who think bratz is a bad influence and calling them ho's and stuff when they're the bad influence saying such things about a doll that is just for entertainment you people disgust me in everyway possible you make things that destory the planet and live not thinking when the planet could be destroyed the way were treating our planet is no better than a murderer becuase were killing animal's and plant's that could've cured a disease get over the doll it didnt do anything to you nor your children its how you raise them not what they play with know the old saying if you got nothing nice to say dont say anything exactly dont say anything at all so i ask again what is the point in saying bad stuff about a doll that has done nothing wrong to anyone its completely stupid and just plain wrong you people just make me want to cry because the way you act is absolutely horrible just think for once what you could be doing to make sure nothing happens to them instead of doing this i agree with sarah be polite and more people will listen to you me for instance i don't like bratz dolls their heads are too big but that doesn't mean i don't care about the earth i do care however if you don't want your daughter to dress like a bratz doll it's smart to not give her a bratz doll and it's hard to keep family and friends from giving her a bratz if she saw it on tv and is begging for it all over the place i agree with you that disliking bratz dolls is much less helpful to the earth than driving a hybrid car but it's quite possible to do both not that i drive a hybrid car i ride a bicycle  Theory of conduct Kodocha Invader Zim Bratz Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Little Britain Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Doll Ranma __ characters Sin City Shaggy dog story Abortion debate Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Johnny the Homicidal Maniac The Inside The Fairly OddParents Taxi Driver Characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion YuYu Hakusho Poker jargon Cliff Richard Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Toy Story 2 Philosophical skepticism Rei Ayanami Shit Futurama (TV series - season 5) Great Teacher Onizuka Married... with Children Final Fantasy: Unlimited Sarah Kerrigan EastEnders Ed, Edd n Eddy W.I.T.C.H.

hess trucks made in hong kong china what's the difference hello a family member gave me a few hess trucks to sell on ebay and i received a question asking if one was made in hong kong or china i know nothing about these trucks and was wondering what the difference was is one of more value if made in a certain place thanks it is possible the trucks were made in both locations and the trucks are identical in make however with some of the trucks the majority were made in hong kong while less were made in china so that would make the one from china worth a bit more  Hong Kong, China at the 2004 Summer Olympics Politics of Hong Kong Hong Kong national football team Hong Kong dollar Economy of Hong Kong Hongkonger Cathay Pacific Cantonese (linguistics) Media in Hong Kong British nationality law Chinese surname Chief Executive of Hong Kong Mid-levels Hong Kong Film Awards Hong Kong Basic Law Battle of Hong Kong Hong Kong Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

can u just take the recalled toys to toys r us or walmart to get ur money back or do u have to send it back to mattel scared wont get money or toys back if i send them in and did anyone return ones they bought before may i have a few we bought in april the stores don't want the toys back the only way you could probably return a toy directly to a store is if it was still in the original package and you had the original receipt basically fisher price and mattel in your case wants to handle this recall by mail and they are picking up the shipping and handling costs by sending a prepaid label for you to mail the affected toys back to them i highly recommend you visit the web page set up for the recall and use the help me determine if i own products affected feature or closely read the review recall announcement they will only compensate for toys that meet the criteria and insist you be the judge that all of their other toys are safe http www service mattel com us recall default asp recall id they advise parents not to throw away the toy or take it to the store where it was purchased because fisher price wants to make arrangements to properly dispose of the toys  Intellivision United States Postal Service Gmail Wal-Mart Video game crash of 1983 The Apprentice 2 Internet fraud Commodore 64 HyperText Transfer Protocol PHP E-mail spam Common Unix Printing System Mattel Stock Visual Basic Microeconomics Sears Holdings Corporation Electronic Arts G.I.

my nephew turns one next week any gift ideas i'm looking for something under something fun and educational would be ideal thanks i've got a great gift idea for you one that is certainly fun and educational buy your nephew books i give books for all occasions and i cannot emphasize enough how important i think it is that you consider giving books as gifts especially with so many negative influences impacting children nowadays please please please i beg you to buy this young boy something other than toys i firmly believe that if you buy him a toy you'll be wasting your money on something he'll outgrow in months if not years or tire of in weeks if not days after all he's turning one i heartily advise you to invest your money in something that when used daily can benefit him for the rest of his life i realize you're probably looking for toy ideas and that's why you posted your question in this forum but think about the impact books can have on this young boy's life think of the special opportunity you have to influence his early learning and foster his emergent reading skills picture yourself reading to him and the joyful moments you two can share exploring the pages of a book a book can be an everlasting gift and you can inscribe a special message within it creating a lasting memory for this boy i still have books that my aunt and uncle gave me when i was a child and i loved rediscovering the inscriptions they wrote me when i read the books again as an adult the single best way to help a child become a reader for life is to read to him you can make a huge difference in this boy's life by giving him books you're establishing that you value reading and literature and you're encouraging him to value the same most young children love to hear the cadence of someone else's voice reading aloud to a child can be calming instructive and just plain fun i advise you to look for books that rhyme or have a rhythmic pattern also pop up books and lift the flap books can be very attractive to children of any age including toddlers i've offered some below there are thousands of books that you might choose for him but let me recommend a few the wide mouthed frog by keith faulkner ill by jonathan lambert terrific pop up book the long nosed pig by keith faulkner ill by jonathan lambert a great companion pop up book to the above shark in the park by nick

chinese product recall what products exactly are affected is it just fisher price affected by this chinese product recall or is it a whole range of baby items decided to see what stuff i have for my new baby that is made in china one item was a painted plastic dinnerware set the company it is made by is babycie com a company based in california so i sent them a very polite email asking if they knew for sure that this product was safe and he sent me back an email saying 'of course it is safe ' so am i supposed to just take his word for it the silly man obviously got very offended that i was asking but honestly does he think i am going to let my child eat off a plate that has paint with lead in it so i just emailed him back and asked how he could be so sure and who was his chinese vendor i suggested that if he was unable to confirm for sure that his products were safe then i would enlist the help of channel news to investigate instead does anyone know if its just fisher price affected or where i could get that info thanx i think you're wise to be concerned i certainly wouldn't trust him i advise you to consider removing all chinese made toys and other products from your home especially any item that your child uses regularly i hate to sound jingoistic but these people clearly do not have the same standards for quality control that we expect in america i am appalled a the rash of recalls we've seen recently involving products made in china here is a photo list of the fisher price toys the company has recalled in cooperation with the united states consumer products safety commission http service mattel com us recall ivr asp prod here is the official notice from the cpsc http service mattel com us recall ivr asp prod the cpsc is also the best place to go for information about other recalls including toys household products and electronics http www cpsc gov here is another toy that has been recalled recently can you guess where it was manufactured right china jeepers http www cpsc gov cpscpub prerel prhtml html  Advance fee fraud HTML Plame affair Video game crash of 1983 Gmail Bicycle helmet Ajax (programming) Phishing E-mail spam Electronic commerce Intellivision The Standard Polyvinyl chloride People's Republic of China 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Television Internet fraud Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cross site scripting Teletext RFID Nintendo Entertainment System United States Postal Service Genetically modified food Bulk vending Mattel Theory of conduct Plame affair timeline Pharmaceutical company Bluetooth Internet censorship in mainland China Lionel Corporation World Wide Web America Online Character encodings in HTML Warez Website Food Speed limit Common Unix Printing System Airsoft Economy of the People's Republic of China Pretty Good Privacy Biodiesel Audiophile Common criticisms of Microsoft E-mail 2003 California recall M16 (rifle) Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Web browser HTTP cookie DVD B3ta Video game publisher Digital photography Trademark Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Casting Roswell UFO incident Airbus A380 Sing Tao Daily Digital audio broadcasting SAML China Vehicle registration plate Internet Coal Mozilla Application Suite RuneScape cheats Thimerosal Web portal MMORPG Surveillance Amazon.com Offshoring Dinky Toy Commodore International David Blunkett Web server Scrabble Roller coaster Inflation Spyware ASP.NET Opera (web browser)

which doll hi my father said i could have any doll of my choice and i was wondering which doll is better blythe or pullip help me decide by price which is cheaper the clothes fashion its prettiness i like pretty dolls and the quality i don't wanna bring it home and see it fall into pieces thx price wise blythe is cheaper fashion wise pullip is more fashionable prettiness pullip's facial features are much prettier quality both have their pros and cons it really depends on if it is a recent or older model doll blythe models the bodies of blythes varies depending on the time of the release earlier releases uses the bl body which has some disadvantages for example the legs do not bend as well as the later releases bl june march licca body is used eyes glance further to the side matte face for some models some also have boggled eyes so the upper lid does not show on their eyes hair is also generally thinner ebl excellent june october new body is introduced unlike the earlier licca body ebl bodies do not have bendable arms though their legs have three clicks at the knee faces are now shiny too sbl superior february new face mold and new sparkly eye chips the new head mold necessitates that in order for inner head customizations to be done they must be sawn open there is also a method to take off the face plate only by soaking in hot water rbl radiance december present new face mold to look more kenner like including a slightly wider left eye this mold allows for easy customization as her head is connected by three screws and an internal clip near the ears ashton drake also produced a replica of the originals kenners with similar boxes and the same outfits and hair colors they tried to make the facemould more similar to the original noticeable differences are the skintone has a slight green tint eyeholes are wider and make up is quite vibrant colors these blythe tend to go for less than takara blythe and obviously no where near the price of the original kenners pullip models early dolls had marmit type bodies with visible screws the first three dolls moon street and wind have weak necks that easily snap especially in transport though this was remedied with later releases starting in december with the release of venus pullips had a new body that was lighter with no visible screws a soft torso and joints that can be pulled apart although with the release of lan ake and lan ai in a newer body was created with hard plastic no soft torso and hinged wrists since arietta was released in march of all dolls have been wigged as opposed to the earlier releases with rooted hair personally i would choose the pullip model it is easier to customize the doll to fit your specific taste with either brand definitely choose a more recent model for quality purposes the older models will fall apart  Professional wrestling throws Violin Barbie Strap-on dildo Wood carving Equine conformation Professional wrestling holds Drill bit Casting Atari 8-bit family Wood My Little Pony IPod Bong Mouse (computing) Plastic Screw Floyd Rose Suplex Domestic AC power plugs and sockets M16 (rifle) Welding Airsoft Anchor Mattress Snowboard Double bass Volleyball Marching band Oscilloscope Hair Professional wrestling aerial techniques Undergarment Bulk vending Bicycle lighting MS-06 Zaku II Stereoscopy Glossary of climbing terms Comanche Fast bowling Textile manufacturing Aikido Harmonica Atari ST Glossary of partner dance terms Hearing aid Clarinet Glass Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Canoe Tofu Pottery Boxing Diving Solar cell Guitar Piledriver (professional wrestling) Floppy disk Dog Saxophone Skateboarding trick Diamond Sega Saturn Ayumi Hamasaki Swimming Naruto jutsu Digital photography Diving suit Swingout Terminal ballistics Electric guitar Backstroke Internal ballistics Wayne Corporation Apple Macintosh Covenant Elite Weight training Headgear Sunglasses Toyota MR2 Windsurfing Dragon Booster The Ashlee Simpson Show Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Horse Carburetor School bus Geodesic dome Breaststroke Eyepiece

scalping morally wrong i been looking for transformers bumblebee toys for awhile now i couldnt find them in toy stores week after week i went to amazon com and ebay surprisingly people have like or more the same toys and sell them for triple the price sometimes more i kinda feel sad for kids who play with toys have to deal with bs my questions are are scalping wrong morally are there anyway to fight these acts while scalping can hurt the intended market for a product it's not morally wrong it's all a matter of supply and demand if there is a short supply of a product and a high demand then people with access to the product are going to sell it for a high price because people are more willing to pay that price as long as people are willing to purchase an item for those prices 'scalpers' are going to continue to sell them for profit really the blame should be placed on the company for failing to produce enough units to meet demand and maximize their sales  Supply and demand Amazon.com Bulk vending Internet fraud Sears Holdings Corporation Economics The Long Tail Wal-Mart Electronic commerce Microeconomics Pixar Lionel Corporation Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Protectionism ITunes Music Store Deflation (economics) Labor theory of value The Apprentice 2 Price discrimination Publishing Supermarket Law of value Prices of production RuneScape economy Neoclassical economics Monopoly Network effect Airline Dot-com Video game crash of 1983 Tariff Exchange value Keynesian economics Illegal drug trade Say's law Lionel, LLC Black market Commodity Pricing Inflation Loss leader Commodore International Monetary policy Arguments for and against drug prohibition Economy of Russia Day trading Tesco Free market Dollar store Technical analysis Gold as an investment Productive and unproductive labour MAME Ethical consumerism Profit maximization Externality Short selling My Little Pony Scalping 1973 oil crisis Mutual fund American individualist anarchism Great Depression Investment bank Hyperinflation Corporation Google Ford Motor Company Toys "R" Us Model (economics) Canadian and American economies compared Food and Drug Administration Value added tax American Flyer Progressive tax Gross domestic product Theory of conduct PlayStation 2 Contract Amway Criticisms of socialism Textbook Privatization Topps Auction Inventory PE ratio Utilitarianism Management information system Kyoto Protocol Grey market Steve Jobs G.I.

how to i make my happy drinking bird work better my happy drinking bird is very slow how can i make my happy drinking bird drink water from the glass faster i try adjusting the bird and it just gets worse the drinking bird is basically a heat engine that exploits a temperature differential to convert heat energy to kinetic energy and perform mechanical work like all heat engines the drinking bird works through a thermodynamic cycle the initial state of the system is a bird with a wet head oriented vertically with an initial oscillation on its pivot the cycle operates as follows the water evaporates from the head maxwell boltzmann distribution evaporation lowers the temperature of the glass head heat of vaporization the temperature drop causes some of the dichloromethane vapor in the head to condense the lower temperature and condensation together cause the pressure to drop in the head ideal gas law the pressure differential between the head and base causes the liquid to be pushed up from the base as liquid flows into the head the bird becomes top heavy and tips over during its oscillations when the bird tips over the bottom end of the neck tube rises above the surface of the liquid a bubble of vapor rises up the tube through this gap displacing liquid as it goes liquid flows back to the bottom bulb and vapor pressure equalizes between the top and bottom bulbs the weight of the liquid in the bottom bulb restores the bird to its vertical position if a glass of water is placed so that the beak dips into it on its descent the bird will continue to absorb water and the cycle will continue as long as there is enough water in the glass to keep the head wet however the bird will continue to dip even without a source of water as long as the head is wet or as long as a temperature differential is maintained between the head and body this differential can be generated without evaporative cooling in the head for instance a heat source directed at the bottom bulb will create a pressure differential between top and bottom that will drive the engine the ultimate source of energy is heat in the surrounding environment the toy is not a perpetual motion machine therefore you can't make it go faster you can perhaps try a warmer temperater  Entropy Steam engine Phase (matter) Water (molecule) Carburetor Brewery Evaporation Siphon Water vapor Thermodynamics Water Fossil fuel power plant Air conditioning Bong Hydropower Heat Boiling point Solar power Energy Vacuum Diode Explosive material Stirling engine Phase transition Thermal power station Transformer Casting Nuclear reactor Carbon dioxide Gas absorption refrigerator Internal combustion engine Spacecraft propulsion Fire fighting Vacuum tube Glass Internal ballistics Tesla coil Heat engine Wind turbine Phase change heat pump Timeline of thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and random processes Fluorescent lamp Hydrogen Incandescent light bulb Electrophysiology Furnace Wind power Mercury arc valve Spark plug Hydrogen economy Superconductivity Greenhouse effect Nuclear power Second law of thermodynamics Soldering Circuit design Power station Helium Gas turbine Laser Turbocharger Swimming Irrigation Ammonia Humidity STS-87 Equine conformation Crookes radiometer Absolute zero Water turbine Bicycle Gas metal arc welding Xenon Seismometer Pebble bed reactor Diving suit Volcano Partial pressure Lake Chromatography Powder metallurgy Rankine cycle Viscosity Sun Ceramics Thermoregulation Perpetual motion

what nice gift should you buy for year old boy a nice gift might be a toy but a better gift would be a book i give books for all occasions and i cannot emphasize enough how important i think it is that you consider giving books as gifts especially with so many negative influences impacting children nowadays please please please i beg you to buy this young boy something other than toys i firmly believe that if you buy him a toy you'll be wasting your money on something he'll outgrow in months if not years or tire of in weeks if not days after all he's only one i heartily advise you to invest your money in something that when used daily can benefit him for the rest of his life buy him books i realize you're probably looking for toy ideas and that's why you posted your question in this forum but think about the impact books can have on this young boy's life think of the special opportunity you have to influence his early learning and foster his emergent reading skills picture yourself reading to him and the joyful moments you two can share exploring the pages of a book a book can be an everlasting gift and you can inscribe a special message within it creating a lasting memory for this boy i still have books that my aunt and uncle gave me when i was a child and i loved rediscovering the inscriptions they wrote me when i read the books again as an adult the single best way to help a child become a reader for life is to read to him forget the fact that he can't read yet he can with your help if you're family then it's your job to present him with quality children's literature and teach him to read you can make a huge difference in this boy's life by giving him books you're establishing that you value reading and literature and you're encouraging him to value the same most young children love to hear the cadence of someone else's voice reading aloud to a child can be calming instructive and just plain fun i advise you to look for books that rhyme or have a rhythmic pattern also pop up books and lift the flap books can be very attractive to children of any age including toddlers i've included some below there are thousands of books that you might choose for him but let me recommend a few the long nosed pig by keith faulkner ill by jonathan lambert the wide mouthed frog by keith faulkner ill by jonathan lambert shark in the park by nick
