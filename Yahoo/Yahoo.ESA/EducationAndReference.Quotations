use of period before and after quotation mark there is a third alternative to choosing either british or north american convention as nicole b said that is 'all signs of punctuation used with words in quotation marks should be placed according to logic' examples bilbo said 'we must find the wizard ' here the full stop is inside the q marks because the word wizard is the logical end of bilbo's sentence but thorin was sure that bilbo had not said 'we must find the wizard' what he had said was 'we must follow the wizard' here in both sentences the full stop is outside the q marks because the sentences ending with the word wizard are both logically about thorin's thoughts  The Hobbit Punctuation Gandalf American and British English differences Full stop Quotation mark Exclamation mark The Fellowship of the Ring Russian orthography Bracket Apostrophe (mark) Dwarves (Middle-earth) Dash Ellipsis Korean language Bilbo Baggins Esperanto orthography Thorin Oakenshield Logic The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Romanian language Question mark Timeline of Arda Abbreviation The Lord of the Rings Frodo Baggins If and only if Philosophy of language Arabic alphabet Meaning Comma (punctuation) HTML element Saruman The Return of the King F__li and K__li Existence Battle of Five Armies Self-reference The Hobbit (1977 film) The Lord of the Rings (1978 film) The Quest of Erebor Lonely Mountain Subjunctive mood Translation Baggins family Weapons of Middle-earth Vacuous truth Logical conjunction Willard Van Orman Quine Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Colon (punctuation) Middle-earth Theodore G.

all is fair in love war can anyone enlighten me about what this phrase means what the heck do you mean literally what does it mean stevie wonder had a song 'all in love is fair' on his 'songs in the key of life' album you could try listening to that anyway the way that people use this phrase is to excuse some kind of behavior that others might not approve of by implying that 'anything goes' in situations involving love and war because these are special circumstances which operate under different rules than the rest of life and therefore extraordinary measures are justified as an extreme example in war it's ok to kill people whereas it isn't in regular life of course sometimes people try to use it to excuse their behavior in situations that have nothing to do with love or war in which case it's just an excuse hope this helps  Fair use Human sexual behavior Cultural relativism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Goodness and value theory Stevie Wonder Homophobia Rich Mullins Murder Theory of conduct Predestination Pacifism Contract Insanity defense Unlawful combatant Euphemism Value system Patriotism Evil Marvin Gaye Capital punishment Social psychology Infantilism Abortion debate Scientology beliefs and practices Just War theory Rape English grammar Happiness Poker jargon Coldplay The Pilgrim's Progress Meaning Fathers' rights Songs in the Key of Life Nicomachean Ethics Shock jock Baptism Theodicy Fleetwood Mac Royal Assent Liberalism Charles Manson Sexual addiction Faster-than-light Epistemology Estoppel David Bowie Singlish Cognitive science Supply and demand Tenchi Muyo!

fire is the most tolerable third party by henry david thoreau i love this quote but i dont know what it means if there are any professors of philosophy or anyone well read with henry david thoreau ideas please tell me what he meant by that quote i was able to confirm using gutenberg that ralph waldo emerson cites fire is the most tolerable third person among thoreau's unpublished writings the works by thoreau available through gutenberg do not include the quotation a further search using google provides an abundance of persons quoting thoreau but apparently they all depend upon the emerson citation having failed to find the quotation in context i can only conclude that while two is company and three is a crowd a fire can be very welcome to the two when they are out in the wild or together at the hearth  Henry David Thoreau Transcendentalism Henry James Sr. Charles Ives Mexican-American War Louisa May Alcott Concord, Massachusetts John Brown (abolitionist) Conservation ethic Poetry of the United States History of modern literature William James Walden New England Plutarch Nathaniel Hawthorne Romanticism Amos Bronson Alcott Walt Whitman Shot heard 'round the world Christian anarchism Civil disobedience Victorian literature Transcendental Generation Thomas Carlyle Johann Wolfgang von Goethe John Burroughs Greater Boston Stanley Cavell Wendell Berry Quotation T.

quote about taboos i saw this quotation at the beginning of the independent film channel show indie sex taboo that went if we can't kill and screw and steal and betray to our heart's desire does anybody know the rest of the quote and who said it it went by too fast for me to write it down and looking it up on yahoo didn't yield anything conclusive thanks if we can't kill and screw and steal and betray to our heart's desire and in general violate every taboo in sight well we can at least watch other people do it or read about it or listen to it as we have done since ancient times through every form of religion and entertainment the appeal of taboos and our inability to escape our longing for transgression whether or not we ourselves transgress are why so many people who call themselves honest and law abiding spend so much time with movies operas soars garish trials novels songs biblical tales tribal myths folk stories and shakespeare virtually all of which both the great and the trivial are about those who dare to violate taboos it's a little unsettling when you think about it the very stuff we say we most object to is the fundamental material of what we call culture  Ten Commandments Property (ownership right) Moses Supernatural Claude L__vi-Strauss Homosexuality Novel Pornography Incest Masturbation Taboo Sexual orientation Rape Human sexual behavior The Handmaid's Tale Mythology Rastafari movement Middle-earth Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Teach the Controversy Resurrection of Jesus Joke Same-sex marriage David Hume History of sex Anal sex Greek mythology Video game controversy Creation-evolution controversy Discordianism Indiana Jones Afrocentrism Rod Stewart Love Sigmund Freud Folk music Pornography in Japan Charles Bukowski Andrea Dworkin Robert A.

there's an old saying 'clean as a whistle' but aren't most whistles rather nasty clean as a whistle is an old saying it's probably from the days of steam powered locomotives steam powered construction equipment steam powered fire apparatus steam powered factory whistles etc and when you have steam pouring through an opening in a whistle its going to leave it pretty darn clean hospitals use steam in autoclaves to sterilize instruments for the operating room so i'd bet that clean as a whistle was true in it's day  Whistle Sterilization (microbiology) Rail terminology Steam engine Walt Disney World Railroad Locomotive Autoclave Steam locomotive nomenclature American Locomotive Company Train Tin whistle British Locomotive and Multiple Unit Numbering and Classification Rail transport Lima Locomotive Works Brewery Stockton and Darlington Railway Novelty (locomotive) William Murdoch Gas turbine-electric locomotive Pennsylvania Railroad Three Mile Island Tattoo Body piercing Live steam Isle of Wight Steam Railway John Bull (locomotive) Thermal power station Tractor Rail transport modelling Calliope (music) Passenger car British Rail Class 42 Kitchen Southern Pacific Railroad James Watt Disneyland Railroad Laboratory Union Pacific Railroad Scrubs Union Pacific Big Boy KCR Liverpool and Manchester Railway USS Pennsylvania (BB-38) 2-8-8-4 Rapid transit The Waterboys Tram Agar plate Hygiene EMD FL9 BC Rail 2-8-2 Fossil fuel power plant Steam turbine USS Augusta (CA-31) Narrow gauge PRR K4s Nicolas L__onard Sadi Carnot Apollo Command/Service Module 4-6-2 Dog agility Yorkshire Engine Company Iowa class battleship Rail transport in India Whyte notation Heat exchanger Stationary engine British Rail Class 86 British Rail Class 87 Valve gear History of rail transport in Ireland Asepsis Social rule USS Wake Island (CVE-65) Horsepower Northeast Corridor George Westinghouse New York Central Railroad Norway national football team International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea Sento Canadian National Railway United States Lighthouse Board History of rail transport USS Lexington (1861) Ferrymead Railway Virginian Railway Baldwin Locomotive Works C__ile Ferate Rom__ne Electric locomotive YuYu Hakusho Swindon EMD Winton-engined switchers USS Tuscaloosa (CA-37) General Motors Electro-Motive Division Rotary snowplow Disneyland USS Manila Bay (CVE-61) Steam locomotives of British Railways Train whistle

grammar questions how can you tell when to use who or whom when using quotations like the one i used earlier should the question mark be out of the quotes or within the teacher's enthusiasm and obvious passion for the subject inspired students who had never before been interested in shakespeare why do we use who instead of what here when in this sentence its considered incorrect when the hometown crowd realized that its team was about to lose the game they started to leave the stadium its incorrect to use they instead of it you can try rephrasing the sentence in your head whom indicates an action that moves towards the other person for example the man whom i gave the money to could be put as i gave the money to him the pronoun him and particularly the final letter m gives you the clue as to whether to use who or whom it just doesn't sound right to say the man who i gave the money to if you're not sure which to use say to yourself did someone do something to that other person if yes then you should use whom as regards the quotation with the question mark you are quite correct in putting the question mark outside the quotes because your question was about the two words who and whom and it concluded the entire sentence the difference between who and what is usually defined as who refers to a human being or beings and what refers to an animal or an object i know that shakespeare said in macbeth what bloody man is that but he was asking what kind of man that was and he was not referring directly to the man now the hometown crowd strictly speaking it should be used before started but it just doesn't sound right it's what some call literary licence everyone knows that a crowd is made up of individual persons and that we should regard the crowd as a homegeneous mass as long as it is static i e watching the game but as soon as the crowd it starts to break up leave the stadium the crowd becomes a collection of individuals who are rightly referred to as they  German grammar Non-native pronunciations of English English grammar Philosophy of language Slovak language Theory of conduct American and British English differences Spanish pronouns Objectivist philosophy Quotation mark Wheel of Fortune Tamil language New York Giants Franz Boas Pronoun Grammatical gender Disputed English grammar Jeopardy!

what is your favorite quote include the person who said it if you know these are some of my fav quotes enjoy and yea i kno its alot do anything and everything in life because there s gonna come a time when you think back when you were just a kid when you re biggest fear was that santa claus was gonna give you coal for christmas that you d stick your tooth under our pillow and t he tooth fairy would forget to leave you a dollar bill and that it wouldn't cross the easter bunny s mind to leave you a basket of treats then you ll see that you re only fear you can t seem to get over is the fear that all those little childhood worries are just gonna be memories and before you know it you d be the one saying wow those were the days she changed her hair painted her nails and renewed her wardrobe she changed herself because she wanted to be noticed by the jock that every girl fell for but while she was doing so she lost her number secret admirer the guy that thought she was perfect when she wore too much make up and when she dressed in ripped jeans the guy that dreamt about being with her while she dreamt of being with another sometimes you gotta teach yourself how to get up from a hard fall cuz if you call for someone's help they just might push you back down there was once a girl who hung out with her friends every friday night a girl who would say lol after every words she would laugh when she slipped while ice skating and just flowed through life without a problem over the summer the girl fell but not from ice skating no but for a boy he was perfect perfect hair smile everything he told her he loved her one day but little did she know she was caught in his trap days later she got a call from him saying i don t love you anymore you re not worth the affection and the phone was hung up school started and the girl walked to lunch alone laughed but only when she thought about how stupid she was to fall for him and discarded all of her friends from any future friday night fun what happened to the up beat loving girl i m really starting to miss her more and more and sometimes i wish i was still years old because the hardest thing i had to deal with then was ken breaking barbie s heart but now now i must be barbie because ken simply destroyed me imagine a world without war a world without aids a world never poor because everyone got paid a world with clean air so everyone could breathe a world where leukemia didn t still your hair and where going blind allowed you to see imagine a world with endless dreams dreamt will all eyes open a world filled with sunshine beams and words for the def spoken imagine a world in color and the black and white will soon go a world where we love each other and where every star can glow for being the girl who never lets herself think anything will go right who never lets herself get too excited cause she knows she ll be let down who never lets herself like that guy too much just incase who s more disappointed each time she s right about all of the bad situations she comes up with in her head who stuck by friends who she only later found out were talking about her behind her back who once felt like she found a real friend then was stabbed in the back again who has parents who just don t won t listen when she tells them that who gets ignored on a daily basis who feels invisible to even important people in her life who has gone through a day being able to count the amount of words she spoke on two hands who goes to sleep feeling alone who just can t wait for things to one day be better different this is for you girls these girls have more strength than any other every day ordinary people never once in their life get recongized for it these are the girls who deserve amazing boyfriends amazing friends don t always get them sometimes people have to settle for what they have but if someone can live through hell then they deserve to make it somewhere better yes i understand now i know that i m always that girl never the girl just that girl the one that gets used hurt lied to betrayed confused the one that boys go to when they need someone to hold onto the one that s never the girl i m always the second best never have i been the one to make boys fall weak at the knees drop everything cause they love me so much want nothing more than to be with me be amazingly happy cause they have me i m the other girl i m getting used to being her every girl wants prince charming while he may be nice all i m thinking i d rather have the guy that s gunna call at am just to say hi or someone who ll stop by my house after just hanging up the phone cause he wants to see how i m really doing cause i said i was fine but we both know i m lying or the guy who ll stay home on a saturday night with me cause i m sick bring me my favorite kind of candy even though i can t eat it cause my stomach flips at the idea that guy that one guy he may not be prince charming to anyone else but he d be my hero my knight in shining armor time is tricky you have whole months even years when nothing changes a speck when you don t go anywhere or do anything or think one new thought then you can get hit with a day or an hour or half a second when so much happens it s almost like you re born all over again into some brand new person you for damn sure never expected to meet no decision you make is wrong as long as it s yours i m living for something i can t even explain i can't really tell you who i am because to me i'm a mix of different things i watch tv shows that other people may find ridiculous i have hobbies that some people may find weird i play sports where i might not be the all star of the team but i have the determination to try these qualities are what make me me if you can't learn to accept that then you obviously don't know the meaning of acceptance i know you think we're better off friends you don't want to ruin what we have now but how do you know if you never try we could be the couple everyone wishes they could be we could be completely in love we'd never know because you were too afraid to take the chance make something more beautiful then it already is im not your exgirlfriend im more like the best thing you ever let go i wish i could pause everything i wish i could put my life on hold just for a second i wish i freeze my tears for a little while i wish i could put emotions on layaway until i know how to handle them there s a difference between you can t have everything in life and you can t talk without taking action believe me i would grant all my wishes if i had the power but i don t so the only other choice i have is to close my eyes and runaway bend down to my knees and just pray be thankful for what i have this very day and for everything i ve been blessed to say depend on no one because in life there s a road you take and one day that road splits in two at the end of each road is success or failure this isn t a guessing game it s a you re the only one that can choose your destiny by depending on no one you make your own decision on you re life so choose wisely because either way there s no one to blame around you yesterday was a day before today tomorrow is after today today is after yesterday but before tomorrow yesterday is behind both tomorrow and today today is between yesterday and tomorrow so tomorrow will be today after yesterday which ever way it goes live for right now because those days aren t guaranteed not even to the richest man flashback turn back in time where you used to sit hours watching the rugrats where you wouldn t ever leave your house without your nano baby and when blues clues was actually challenging rewind back to the times when your favorite shows were doug ren stimpy pinky and the brain aaaaaaah real monsters and rocko s modern life when you watched re runs of tgif step by step family matters dinosaurs and boy meets world when you remember reading every series of goosebumps or in that case remember listening to your mom read them as she grew bored and bored and as you grew more excited as to what would happen next when bringing plastic cartoon lunch boxes to school was pretty much cool and saying not after every sentence was the way to talk when every argument was settled by rock paper scissors bubble gum bubble gum in a dish or daddy had a donkey inky binky bonky when cops and robbers was a daily activity and when hide and go seek was put to pause only when it was snack time the days when we used to actually obey our parents and when the radio was all we depended on for music when you knew that kimberly the pink ranger and tommy the green ranger were meant to be together when you always wanted to send in a tape to america's funniest home videos but never taped anything funny so you gave up when the magic school bus made you think that school buses could fly and when yo yos made you popular when getting married meant buying your crush a ring pop and blabbing some random words behind the dumpster when reading that little paper in the fortune cookie meant everything to you because it predicted your life the days when you could tell furbie all your little secrets and expect him to talk back and when beanie babies were the talk of the class when you got creeped out by are you afraid of the dark and when you knew the macarena by heart when you lied to your parents to bring you to mcdonalds because you were starving when really you wanted to play in the play place when gas was a gallon caller id was a new thing and when checking out drawing books and rainbow fish from the library was the cool thing to do before we realized all this would eventually disappear we didn t bother to think of how good things were flashback to the world we live in now you think you know who your true friends are wait till high school see who's there for you when your ex boyfriend spreads rumors about you think you'll never do drugs wait till it's right there in front of you all your friends are doing it think your tough wait till you say the wrong thing to the wrong person see who backs down first think you're smart wait till you have an english paper science project history test a minute monologue due tomorrow cause you were absent for day think you're cool wait till you're the only one who doesn't make the sports team see how cool you are then you think you're popular wait till your parents can't afford the new hollister jeans everyone has think you'll never fall in love wait till a guy looks deep in your eyes says he loves you think you'll never get your heart broken wait till that same guy who said he loved you is holding another girl behind your back think you won't have sex wait till the guy you think you love says it'll make you closer think nothing's going to happen to you yea wait till you're sitting in a jail cell wondering how you got caught think that you're always going to be your own individual well wait till one morning when you look in the mirror you're just like everybody else dear boy so maybe you i were supposed to end this way both going in our own directions we are two completely different people and no matter how hard we tried we couldn't overcome our differences no i'm not sad that it's over between us but yet i'm not happy either we had something special but in the end the sparks just didn't cut it anyways i'm mostly writing this letter to tell you i've met someone else someone else who can make me smile give me butterflies someone who reaches for my hand first and likes to rub my thumb just like you did he knows that i love it when boys hold the door open for me i love to joke around he makes me happier then i've been in a long time maybe he could be the one who knows but boy i want to thank you you showed me what love was what love meant i hope someday you find the perfect girl because obviously i never was and never will be at least not for you i wish you all the love happiness in the world all i ever wanted was for you to be happy and i guess now i'm finally getting my wish goodbye boy never forget me i love you sincerely me i was really only coming to your house that night to pick up my movies and a few sweatshirts i left there i wasn't looking for a conversation i wasn't searching for one last good bye kiss you had moved on and i had convinced myself that getting back my stuff was the last step and then i too would move on but as i grabbed the movies off the shelf and turned to face you for the last time i felt my heart start to beat faster and the butterflies i kept telling myself weren't there started to make me smile and as you came closer my palms started sweating it was like the past month we had forgotten what we made what we had and in a matter of minutes it came back to us as you put your hand on my face and we kissed i felt like my heart slowly became unbroken and all the tears were suprisingly worth it and i realized that maybe losing you was what i needed to show myself that you truly are my everything and then baby we fell completely in love with eachother all over again do you see her face girls like that are born with a boyfriend we go to school for thirteen years the one thing they never teach us is how to say goodbye here i am sitting here again reading quotes again with only one person on my mind the whole time laugh at stupid jokes cry get revenge apologize tell someone how much they really mean to you let someone know what they're missing laugh till your stomach hurts live life because tomorrow's not guaranteed to anyone i'm sick of pretending i don't care 'cause obviously i do i'm sick of being treated this way especially by you i don't want to hear that you don't care and you tired of hearing about me even if it's true i don't want to hear that you've fogot about me and found someone new when all i can think about is you news flash when a girl says she's cold you're not supposed to say me too sorry hun but unlike you i'm not a doorknob where everyone gets a turn i'm more of a casino where only the lucky ones win the jackpot you know it s love when the silence between you two is comfortable the world is going to throw us a million reasons why this isn t gunna work out between us but i m armed with the one reason why it will i love you you can t do this you can t put one relationship on hold for another it s like call waiting you leave one person on hold long enough they re going to hang up love your enemies just in case your friends turn out to be a bunch of bastards don t be flattered that he misses you he should miss you you re deeply missable however he s still the same person who just broke up with you remember the only reason he can miss you is cause he s choosing everyday not to be with you i don t want your boyfriend nobody wants your boyfriend that's why he s with you everyone says love hurts when actually love doesn't hurt love didn't leave you for some other girl it didn't cheat on you nor did it break your heart so stop blaming love for once and start blaming the ahole that treated you like crap and gave you up two people who broke up could never be friends but if they are then they were never in love or they still are my ex and i still are im not really sure which is the case lol how come guys exchange facts but its assumed girls are gossiping are in a bad mood but its assumed girls are pmsing are always hungry but its assumed girls need to get in shape and lose weight just dont want a girlfriend but its assumed girls are too ugly to get a guy guys get away with things too easily a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes hope you liked them much lov god bless
