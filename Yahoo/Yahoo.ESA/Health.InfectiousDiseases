once you aquire mrsa do you have it for life mrsa is not normally a lifetime infection if it is treated properly and in time so as not to develop into septicaemia there are new products available to treat prevent and cure mrsa infection if taken regularly this will prevent any further episodes what is mrsa methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus is a common type of staph bacterium which lives on the skin and in the nasal passages of around of the population mostly this staph aureus bacterium does no harm and does not pose a problem with infection or require a cure but like many bacterium staphylococcus aureus has the ability to pose a serious infection problem if you are feeling run down ill injured or if you have undergone any form of surgery it can cause a very serious staph infection if it enters the body such as through open wounds or instruments placed in the body or by cross contamination from another patient nursing staff or specialist without proper treatment this can lead to death or be difficult to cure an antibiotic called methicillin was used for the treatment and cure of infections caused by staph bacterium the term 'methicillin resistant' means that this type of antibiotic can no longer kill of the staph bacterium and another antibiotic needs to be used if available if methicillin can no longer be used for the treatment and cure of staphylococcus aureus infection it is medically referred to as mrsa the causation of mrsa antibiotics have been in use for many years as a successfull treatment and cure for staph infections however these antibiotics have been overused misused and over prescribed as a cure for staph aureus infection for many years it is fairly common for people to not complete a course of antibiotics or not use as prescribed if this happens it is probable that not of the bacterium that caused staph infection will have been killed surviving staph bacterium develop a resistance to this antibiotic and multiply as more and more antibiotics are prescribed the number of staph bacterium that are able to resist those antibiotics become more numerous the biggest problem with the use of antibiotics is that they are non focused therefore they do not discriminate between good and bad bacteria otherwise known as 'flora' which can be found in the large intestines and form a large part of the bodies immune system without this immune system protection 'superbugs' are free to develop treatment of mrsa mrsa can be treated with different antibiotics to methicillin however this is becoming increasingly difficult medications such as antiseptic wash and certain ointments can be used to remove mrsa from the nasal passages and skin even when it is doing no harm to the individual however there is now a new product that has been proven to be effective in killing all mrsa bacterium and a lot of other known pathogens the new silver solution is non toxic proven in multiple tests at times the recommended dosage the new silver solution is the first colloidal silver product to attain a new patent in over years this product can be used internally externally and as a surfectant to both prevent and cure mrsa infection the new silver solution can also be used with animals and all our test data shows it to be very effective travel protection is travel to the middle east or iraq or africa a worry then the new silver solution is a medical 'must have' against infection protect yourself from disease outbreak mrsa or methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus as it is medically termed and malaria and avian bird flu the new silver solution also protects and will cure other staph infections yeast infection sinus infection urinary tract infection staph skin infections and a host of other pathogens and bacteria it does not only prevent these infections it can cure them those are claims which are verified medical institutions across the globe have conducted extensive tests on the new silver solution it is patented and has been forwarded to the fda for approval even though it is not a drug staphylococcus aureus causes many bacterial infections these can be boils carbuncles infected wounds deep abscesses and most worryingly infection of the blood stream which is medically termed as bacteraemia blood stream infection is also sometimes called septicaemia this is of greater severity and clinical significance a wide variety of bacterium can cause bacteraemia but one of the most common is staphylococcus aureus this is a very difficult situation for treatment or cure the symptoms though are not specific to mrsa they can be the same for other bacterium that cause septicaemia symptoms of septicaemia can include high fever rigors shaking a raised white blood cell count and disturbance in clotting of the blood with a tendency to bleed and ultimate failure of the vital organs this is the kind of mrsa infection that has the highest death rate in england and wales and also now in the usa mrsa bacterium can be found on the skin in the nose in wounds and in blood and urine or any other body site they are most likely to cause infection when a person has a break in their skin or another opening where bacterium can get inside the body common skin conditions caused by mrsa include infected cuts boils infected hair follicles fluid filled blisters impetigo or skin sores that look like infected insect bites minor mrsa infection can sometimes develop into more serious complications such as spread of the staph infection to surrounding tissues serious abscesses blood bone or heart infection first descriptions of staph aureus came in the 's it came to the attention of medical practitioners that this bacterium was the most common cause of infection of wounds following surgical procedures surgery tube insertion instruments etc although penicillin was discovered by sir alexander fleming in penicillin was not introduced against s aureus until the 's and most strains of s aureus were found sensitive to its use prior to penicillin these infections could cause serious or sometimes even fatal infection as no treatment or cure was available before penicillin unfortunately when penicillin was used for treatment of these staph infections a few strains of staph aureus made a protective enzyme called penicillinase which broke down the penicillin and protected the staph aureus bacterium beta lactamase is a type of enzyme produced by some bacterium that is responsible for their resistance to beta lactam antibiotics like penicillins cephalosporins cephamycins and carbapenems these antibiotics have a common element in their molecular structure a four atom ring known as a beta lactam the lactamase enzyme breaks that ring open deactivating the molecule's antibacterial properties these strains had become very resistant to penicillin and in approximately of all staph aureus strains which were taken from patients with clinical infections were penicillin resistant the bacterium that caused these infections had become evolutionist in nature penicillin was therefore no longer effective for the treatment and cure of these resistant staph aureus strains 'methicillin' was the next medical development and was derived from penicillin to treat these evolutionist staph aureus strains it was manufactured to combat the degradation of the antibiotic by the newly formed enzyme called penicillinase this ensured that the previously penicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus would still be treatable by using this new medical drug about a year after the initial use of methicillin mrsa was discovered in england staphylococcus aureus had again become evolutionist in nature and was now resistant to methicillin there are few reports about mrsa in the 's and the 's more appeared during the 's it became massive in the mid 's epidemic levels of certain strains of mrsa became uncontrollable in medical hospitals throughout the united kingdom many believe that the cause of this outbreak was associated with new comfortable living habits and as a result a reduction in our immune system strength these new strains are very infectious and transmit easily colonisation was taking place between the medical staff and patients they were treating the new strains have the ability to cause very serious infections these new strains now represent about of the staph aureus bacterium found in patients with blood stream infections in england wales and the usa the staphylococcal family staph aureus is just one of a large family of staphylococcal bacterium their normal place of residence is on the human skin the most common non staph aureus staphylococcus on human skin is called s epidermidis generally harmless and called part of the 'normal communal flora' of the human body many s epidermidis are also resistant to antibiotics including methicillin they have the same resistance mechanism as mrsa and are referred to as mrse although resident on everyone's skin but normally harmless s epidermidis causes significant infection if it enters wounds upon medical devices for example artificial hip joints heart valves or when medical staff use intravenous catheters to provide access the bloodstream severely ill patients such as those in intensive medical care units or those undergoing cancer chemotherapy are at a greater risk of this sort of infection than most others mrsa colonisation staphylococcus aureus of the most common kind including those strains that are mrsa in nature can cause a very wide range of infection these range from asymptomatic colonisation where the mrsa is doing no damage but still has the capability of causing clinical infection to fatal septicaemia which is the most severe form of blood stream infection trying to treat or cure septicaemia is nigh on impossible colonisation areas about of the worlds population is colonised by staph aureus in medical hospitals the percentage is greatly increased due to more contact with cases of infection staph aureus carriage is more likely to be mrsa in hospital populations more amongst patients and medical staff than in the general community this is because antibiotic resistant bacterium are encouraged to develop by the use of antibiotics to treat ranges of infections in hospitals that being said community acquired mrsa ca mrsa is also on the increase especially in countries like the middle east iraq and africa http www mrsamedical com

bladder infection so last year in november i got this semi bladder infection it had the symptoms such as urgency to urinate fequently and pain when urinating however it did not test as a bladder infection i have it again right now and im wondering what i can do to help it go away thank you as i said it didnt test as one so i was wondering what else i can do my mom had suggested last tiem that i drink this cranberry juice or something similar but it was disgusting so i was wondering about things like that you appear to be a little confused uti stands for urinary tract infection which means the infection is somewhere in the urinary tract not necessarily the bladder bladder infections usually present with a certain level of bacteria whereas other utis have more or less if it's really bad it could be a kidney infection which is what you're describing plus sharp stabbing pains in your lower to mid back not a backache like someone is taking a inch serrated steak knife and stabbing you in your kidneys there are over the counter products such as azo that will help as far as cranberry juice goes it helps a lot with the pain something about it kills whatever it is that makes it hurt when you pee which is why everyone says drink cranberry juice i would recommend ocean spray cranberry juice which is a bit tart mixed with sprite over ice it's the only way i could get it down but even two glasses of that a day helped also make sure you drink lots of water it will help flush all the nasty bacteria out of your system drinking too many caffinated beverages will dehydrate you which can cause a uti in the first place that's how i get mine it will help relieve pain too  Urinary incontinence Urine Urinary tract infection Kidney stone Prostate cancer Kidney Cystoscopy Medical analysis of circumcision Pneumonia Urination Vitamin C Vulvovaginal health Dehydration Gout Escherichia coli O157:H7 Cider Cranberry Benign prostatic hyperplasia Breastfeeding Prostatitis Gonorrhoea Bearberry IgA nephropathy Nephrology Urethra Acute renal failure Ethanol Paget's disease of bone Escherichia coli Leptospirosis Hydronephrosis Diabetic neuropathy Pyelonephritis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Rum Diabetes insipidus Legionellosis Aspartame Hyperglycemia Antiretroviral drug Group A streptococcal infection Autoimmune diseases First aid Endometriosis Soft drink Water Chronic fatigue syndrome Common cold Obstetrics Guinea pig Diabetic ketoacidosis Medicine Penis Hip fracture Anthrax Lesch-Nyhan syndrome 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Coffee Beer HIV test Tea Epididymitis Dialysis Hypertension Herpes simplex virus Nutrition Lupus erythematosus Cirrhosis Psoriasis Tattoo Pig (zodiac) Urolagnia Milk Abdominal pain Back pain Ebola Cheese Gastroesophageal reflux disease Cytomegalovirus Conjunctivitis Dysentery Alcoholic beverage Malaria Paracetamol Interstitial cystitis Survival skills Replacement joint Sexually-transmitted infection

tapeworm how do you get tapeworm how do you know if you have it can it kill you tya definition tapeworms are a group of parasitic worms that live in the intestinal tracts of some animals several different species of tapeworms can infect humans tapeworm disease or cestodiasis occurs most commonly after eating raw or undercooked meat or fish that contains the immature form of the tapeworm description tapeworm infections pose a serious public health problem in many less developed countries due to poor sanitation conditions the disease is most common where livestock such as cattle and pigs are raised in areas where human feces are not disposed of in a sanitary manner another common source of human tapeworms are certain species of freshwater fish tapeworm infections tend to occur more frequently in areas of the world where the people regularly eat raw or undercooked beef pork or fish persons of all ages and both sexes are susceptible to tapeworm infection but children are generally not exposed until they are old enough to begin eating meat or fish tapeworm infections in humans are less common in industrialized regions of the world although german public health experts reported in that the rate of these infections is higher in europe than the official statistics indicate travel to areas where tapeworm infections are more common and immigration of people from these areas serve as new sources of the parasite infected persons are often unaware of the presence of adult tapeworms in their intestinal tract as they may have no obvious symptoms of infection some tapeworms can live in an infected person for over years if diagnosis is not made and treatment is not administered in addition to the typical infection caused by eating undercooked meat or fish people may also be directly infected by ingesting tapeworm eggs shed by the adult worm this type of tapeworm infection can lead to a condition referred to as cysticercosis in which the larvae continue to develop within tissues other than the intestinal tract one of the most serious forms of this disease occurs when the tapeworm larvae infect the central nervous system a disease referred to as neurocysticercosis in contrast to a typical tapeworm infection which may not be associated with symptoms neurocysticercosis is a serious condition that may cause seizures and is potentially life threatening causes and symptoms several species of tapeworm can infect people the two most common species are the pork tapeworm taenia solium and the beef tapeworm taenia saginata improperly treated human sewage may be used to fertilize pastures or crops pigs or cattle become infected by grazing in contaminated pastures or drinking water contaminated with tapeworm eggs from human feces the pea sized larvae of these tapeworms are deposited in certain tissues of the body of infected pigs and cattle including the muscles the infection is then transmitted to people when raw or undercooked meat containing tapeworm larvae is consumed the immature tapeworm develops into the adult form in the human intestine and may remain there for many years if not identified and treated the taenia tapeworms attach to the intestinal walls but cause only mild inflammation at the site of attachment as a result most tapeworm carriers show no symptoms asymptomatic and usually become aware of the infection only after noticing tapeworm segments in their feces segments of the beef tapeworm may spontaneously pass through the anus causing a noticeable sensation mild gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or abdominal pain can occur in infected individuals in rare cases where the tapeworm segments migrate into the appendix pancreas or bile duct there may be a sudden onset of severe abdominal discomfort cysticercosis is a potentially serious complication of taenia solium infection in which the larvae develop outside the intestinal tract this type of infection is less common and occurs following accidental consumption of tapeworm eggs released from the adult worm these eggs initially are localized in the anal area but they may also contaminate the fingers or other parts of the body infection can occur in the person harboring the adult tapeworm or in other people with whom that individual comes in contact the tapeworm larvae may develop in various tissues throughout the body the most serious clinical problems occur when the larvae develop in the central nervous system neurocysticercosis potentially causing seizures and other neurological problems an important aspect of this type of infection is that poor hygiene on the part of the individuals harboring an adult tapeworm can lead to an infection in an individual who may never consume meat this is a particular problem if infected individuals are employed as food handlers another important tapeworm that may infect people is the fish tapeworm diphyllobothrium latum this is a frequent human intestinal parasite in many areas where raw freshwater fish is consumed human infection with the fish tapeworm is referred to as diphyllobothriasis feces from infected hosts or raw sewage contaminates a fresh water source tapeworm larvae are initially ingested by freshwater crustaceans and then are eaten by fish human infection occurs when a person consumes raw fish contaminated with the tapeworm larvae adult tapeworms then develop in the human intestinal tract most infections with the fish tapeworm are not associated with symptoms the tapeworm causes little damage to the lining of the intestine infected individuals may report diarrhea fatigue weakness or sensation of hunger more commonly than uninfected individuals one problem unique to this tapeworm is that it may compete with the host for absorption of vitamin b from the small intestine causing the person to become deficient in this vitamin and leading to a condition called pernicious anemia two smaller species of tapeworms may also infect people the dwarf tapeworm hymenolepis nana is a common infection throughout the world that can be passed from one person to another transmission is usually the result of inadvertent ingestion of tapeworm eggs from feces eliminated by infected individuals as a result infection with this tapeworm is encountered most frequently in children the developmentally disabled and psychiatric patient populations abdominal pain that is not localized to any particular area is the most common complaint patients may experience loose bowel movements or diarrhea with mucus but bloody diarrhea is rare another small tapeworm capable of infecting people is the rodent tapeworm hymenolepis diminuta rats mice and other rodents are the usual hosts for the adult tapeworm definitive host but humans can become infected following accidental consumption of insects containing tapeworm larvae meal worms or grain beetles that infest cereal flour or dried fruit are the most likely source of infection most human infections are not associated with symptoms although some individuals report headaches anorexia nausea and diarrhea diagnosis identification of tapeworm segments or eggs in a stool sample is necessary for diagnosis of an adult tapeworm infection in many cases a tentative diagnosis may be made on the basis of a patient's description of short chains of tapeworm segments in their stool further evaluation is recommended to determine the actual species involved since infection with taenia solium is potentially more serious due to the added risk of cysticercosis whenever possible tapeworm segments should be carefully collected in water or salt solutions using strict precautions to avoid contamination stool examination should be performed in a laboratory having experience in the diagnosis of intestinal parasites it is recommended that at least three stool samples be collected on alternate days to increase the likelihood of being able to make an accurate diagnosis although the general appearance of tapeworm segments from the two taenia species is quite similar trained laboratory personnel can detect distinct differences between the beef and pork tapeworms when samples are examined under a microscope tapeworm segments and eggs from the fish tapeworm and the dwarf tapeworm have characteristic appearances that allow accurate differentiation from the taenia species of worms other diagnostic procedures may be necessary when cysticercosis is suspected blood samples from an infected individual are collected to look for the presence of antibodies against the tapeworm larvae in researchers isolated an antigen diagnostic for cysticercosis alled gp in cases in which infection of the central nervous system is present advanced imaging tests such as computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging mri may be necessary to determine the exact location of the tapeworm larvae within the body ultrasound imaging is also being used as of to diagnose tapeworm infections because of the recent rise in immigration and travel clinicians in developed countries are seeing more patients with tapeworms the world health organization who has developed standardized sets of ultrasound images to help doctors recognize the signs of a parasitic infection in some cases ultrasound allows the doctor to see the tapeworm directly treatment effective treatment of tapeworm infections involves administering compounds that are toxic to the adult worm many of the early treatments were also somewhat toxic to the patient so treatment was often quite an ordeal newer medications are much more easily tolerated and are highly effective in eliminating the parasite from the body it is important however to completely eliminate the head and neck regions of the tapeworm as the entire worm can regenerate from these parts one treatment that has been in use since the early s is niclosamide niclocide this drug is poorly absorbed from the digestive tract and rapidly kills tapeworms upon exposure it has been shown to be effective against taenia species and the fish tapeworm but treatment of the dwarf tapeworm hymenolepis nana may require a more prolonged treatment schedule side effects reported with niclosamide are infrequent and typically mild when present side effects may include nausea abdominal discomfort vomiting diarrhea light headedness and skin rash this medication should be taken in the morning on an empty stomach the tablets are chewed thoroughly and swallowed with water for young children the tablets may be pulverized and mixed with water patients are allowed to eat two hours after treatment recommended dosage is grams for adults and about half this for children another oral medication that has been shown to be effective in the treatment of tapeworm infections associated with both taenia and diphyllobothrium latum species is praziquantel biltricide side effects reported for praziquantel are mild and appear to be short lived they include nausea abdominal pain itching sore joints and muscle pain it is recommended that follow up stool samples be examined at one month and three months after treatment has been completed treatment can be considered successful if no eggs are present in several stool samples it should be noted that the tapeworm medications do not kill the tapeworm eggs when they kill the adult worm so the potential for infection with eggs still exists as the dead worm segments are passed proper personal hygiene in individuals receiving treatment will greatly reduce this potential cases of neurocysticercosis where larvae have developed in the central nervous system may also be treated with praziquantel or albendazole if the patient is treated promptly damage to the central nervous system will be minimized as of late researchers in developing countries are working on a vaccine for pigs to help control neurocysticercosis however the vaccine is not likely to be available for several years prognosis when confined to the intestinal tract tapeworms cause minimal damage to their human host once the diagnosis of an intestinal tapeworm infection has been made prognosis following treatment with niclosamide or praziquantel is good the worms can be eliminated from the intestines with oral treatment and there are usually no residual side effects serious problems from tapeworm infections occur when tapeworm eggs are consumed and the larvae localize in tissues outside the digestive tract cysticercosis prompt diagnosis and treatment of this condition is necessary to prevent permanent damage to the central nervous system and other internal organs in fact cysticercosis is becoming increasingly recognized as an important cause of severe neurologic disease in the united states untreated cases of cysticercosis have the rare potential to be life threatening in some cases liver transplantation has been necessary to save the patient's life prevention the best way to prevent infection with tapeworms is to eliminate the exposure of livestock to the tapeworm eggs by properly disposing of human feces the next best strategy is to thoroughly cook or freeze all meat and fish before it is eaten to prevent consumption of live tapeworm larvae in infected samples larval cysts in pork and beef are killed by moderate temperatures of f c or if frozen for at least hours proper cooking of freshwater fish could also eliminate the possibility of human infection with the fish tapeworm freezing fresh fish for hours will also kill the larval form people who raise sheep or horses should have these animals checked regularly by a veterinarian and dewormed if necessary the centers for disease control and prevention cdc recommends that people traveling abroad should wash their hands with soap and water before handling food should wash and peel all raw vegetables and fruits before eating and should drink only bottled or boiled water or carbonated drinks in cans or bottles

any way to get rid of an advanced toe nail fungus every nail has it some of them have curled into what i can only descibe as tubes they are very difficult to clip if anyone can give me advice on that it would be much appreciated i take so many perscriptions already that i have had one doctor tell me she wouldn't perscibe my anything for it because of potential liver damage this is a difficult one you have onychomycosis and it is very difficult to treat topical antifungals creams ointments lotions are not very effective at getting rid of the infection there are some medications that can be used to treat it though like terbinafine itraconazole fluconazole and griseofulvin you have to take the medication for months it can be very expensive if you are on other medications there can be a lot of interaction problems and even if you aren't on any other medications these medications can cause liver problems however you can obtain blood labs before and during treatment to monitor your liver and the medications could be stopped if there was any sign of liver problems but the last bit of bad news is this even if you convince a physician to prescribe it and you monitor your liver with blood lab draws and you find a way to pay for it and you take it for months there is still a fairly high failure rate and you might have to repeat the treatment with one of the other medications and even if you cure it and get rid of the infection completely you will have around a chance of having a recurrence in the future i don't want to discourage you but am only providing you with the facts and if you are really determined to get rid of it then talk to your doctor again armed with this information ask to get the lab draws to monitor your you liver and tell your doctor you are willing to accept the possibility of failure and recurrence at this point your doctor should agree if not see another doctor or ask your doctor for a referral to a dermatologist who will certainly help you i hope this helped some  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Psoriasis Stomach cancer Medicine Prostate cancer Malaria Athlete's foot Chronic fatigue syndrome Folic acid Hypoglycemia Eczema Diabetes mellitus Homeopathy Terbinafine hydrochloride Stroke Herpes simplex virus Pneumonia Cirrhosis Pharmaceutical company Nail disease Organ transplant Nail (anatomy) Malignant melanoma Paracetamol Crohn's disease Alcoholism Glycogen storage disease type I Insulin Urinary incontinence Fecal incontinence Acne Bipolar disorder Bone marrow transplant Growth hormone treatment Hepatitis C Medical prescription Rocky Mountain spotted fever Chlorpromazine Doxepin AIDS Myocardial infarction Theory of conduct Traumatic brain injury Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Alternative medicine First aid Emergency Medical Services Childbirth Medical analysis of circumcision Dermatology Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Health insurance Aspergillosis Tocopherol Phimosis Sleep apnea Gout Maprotiline Cytomegalovirus Intravenous therapy Epilepsy Animal testing Ebola Duesberg hypothesis Gastroparesis Diabetic retinopathy Leukemia Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Cephalic disorder Osteoarthritis Clinical depression Terri Schiavo Blood pressure Dialysis Clomipramine Hypertension Conjunctivitis Shock Asthma Autism Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Stem cell Plame affair Miscarriage Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Antifungal drug Prolactinoma Syphilis Propranolol Psychiatry

how long can hiv live in laboratory temperature because hiv is a virus it is technically not living but i know what you mean along with the previous answerer i do not know what you mean by lab temperature a virus cannot live on its own without a host you could keep it alive in a laboratory setting as long as it still has a host to infect for example you could run experiments with the hiv by infecting other cells however once those cells are dead and there is not a suitable environment the hiv will no longer live you could keep the virus in a dormant stage by freezing it with liquid nitrogen the virus will remain viable for many decades after the initial freezing i read an experiment once where they successfully inactivated hiv by heating it to degrees c and i am sure as long as the virus has a host any reasonable temperature will be suitable  HIV Cytomegalovirus Antiretroviral drug HIV test AIDS reappraisal HIV Disease Progression Rates Cryonics Computer virus AIDS Antiviral drug T-Virus Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Diseases of the honeybee HIV structure and genome Myxobolus cerebralis Apoptosis Timeline of AIDS Polymerase chain reaction Herpes simplex virus Human papillomavirus Brewery Ebola Spanish flu AIDS in Africa Prostate cancer Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus Multiple sclerosis Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Stem cell Virulence Immune system Tyrant (Resident Evil) Breastfeeding James D.

why does india have the highest levels of tb in the world http www business standard com common storypage c php leftnm autono http en wikipedia org wiki tuberculosis epidemiology http www indiatogether org nov hlt tbdanger htm http www cdcnpin org scripts tb tb asp http www medindia net news view news main asp x the reasons are plenty the main reason i think is poor compliance to the treatment earlier tuberculosis needed institutionalised care tb hospitals and sanatorium and the sufferer had to live in the hospital for at least months to receive the care that are needed and only was discharged home when received a negative sputum test nowadays it is no more a institutionalised care especially after introducing dot system i personally feel that there is no enough health care workers to effectively implement this system lack of knowledge is another factor i have seen patients discontinuing their drug treatment after months because they have seen some improvement in their weight and other clinical symptoms pathetically they end up in multi resistant tb which costs more to treat and patients do experience very unpleasant side effects this is another reason for the poor compliance increasing number of population is diagnosed to having hiv aids in india so tb has become an opportunistic infection among these population again i would stress on eduacation for the general population especially the relationship between aids and tb ignorance and religious belief could be the other reasons why we still are unable to drop the incidence of tb although tb is thought to be a urban disease still it hits the population of malnourished in the rural area however people do decline treatment for various religious reasons and don t want to be stigmatised in the society so no treatment and no cure growing urbanisation is another reason  AIDS Clinical depression Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tuberculosis Stomach cancer Prostate cancer Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Cancer AIDS in Africa HIV test Pneumonia Asthma Anorexia nervosa Psychiatric hospital Multiple sclerosis Duesberg hypothesis Antiretroviral drug Chronic fatigue syndrome Mental illness Migraine Tuberculosis treatment AIDS reappraisal Malaria Publicly funded medicine Alcoholism Autism HIV Controversies in autism Rabies Traumatic brain injury Medical analysis of circumcision Hypertension Schizophrenia Alternative medicine Homeopathy Growth hormone treatment Health insurance Common cold Coeliac disease Urinary incontinence AIDS pandemic Psychiatry Dissociative identity disorder Traditional Chinese medicine Alzheimer's disease Public health in mainland China Hepatitis C Mother Teresa Psoriasis Sexually-transmitted infection Stroke Pharmaceutical company Antidepressant Crohn's disease Haloperidol Folic acid HIV vaccine Rocky Mountain spotted fever Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Antiviral drug Endometriosis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Health care in the United States Palliative care Timeline of AIDS Lung cancer Anxiety Post-traumatic stress disorder Acne Psychosis Rheumatoid arthritis Breastfeeding HIV Disease Progression Rates Involuntary commitment PHP Transsexuality Obsessive-compulsive disorder Acute respiratory distress syndrome Borderline personality disorder Diarrhea Drug addiction Psychoanalysis Gonorrhoea Cystic fibrosis Medical cannabis Obesity Chagas disease Chlorpromazine

can you get chicken pox after being vaccinated i had chicken pox as a small child and was vaccinated for it too i was recently exposed to it and i am going to visit someone who has just been diagnosed with cancer and was wondering if i could get them sick i need help if you had chickenpox varicella when you were a kid and were also vaccinated you are most likely immune to it therefore it is very unlikely that you can catch it and pass it on to someone else in other words you can't infect the person that has cancer  Chickenpox Smallpox M.A.U.R.I.C.E.

foot and mouth what is the problem why can't the animals be vaccinated against f m they have said that there is no plans to mass vaccinate the first thing to know about fmd is that there are seven 'serotypes' layman's term subspecies of the virus furthermore each serotype has several subtypes of its own what this means is that a vaccine for one type of fmd infection tends not to be effective as a vaccine for any other types of fmd infections so you'd need tends of different vaccines to cover fmd bottom line it's tough to vaccinate prophylactically routinely as a preventative measure there are vaccines available though contrary to the above answerer and any particular infection is caused by only one serotype so it can be done secondly and far more importantly countries importing meat prefer it if the country is both a disease free and b vaccine free why the latter well there are concerns about vaccination in some quarters does it mask the actual disease does it cause the actual disease etc in other words it literally pays countries not to vaccinate as odd as that sounds in fact the european union actually bans prophylactic vaccination although it is less strict on emergency vaccination i e once an outbreak is confirmed it is permissible to vaccinate others to stop the disease but you can't vaccinate to prevent disease in the first place however the eu would subsequently ban the export of the 'emergency vaccinated' animals for six months so governments are reluctant to do this one final important point it is exceptionally rare for humans to get infected with fmd and when they do they always recover this puts things into quite a nasty perspective we are not vaccinating against fmd simply because people are scared of the vaccine instead we resort to slaughter of animals with any chance of having the disease we could still make a reasonable case for this if we were were sure that the vaccine was so terrible but are we  Rabies H5N1 Influenza 2001 UK foot and mouth crisis Smallpox Avian influenza Malaria Influenza pandemic Vaccine Poliomyelitis Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Ebola Cancer Measles Anthrax Meningitis Human papillomavirus Adenoviridae Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Pneumonia AIDS Rotavirus Monkeypox Herpes simplex virus Singaporean measures against avian influenza Mumps West Nile virus Spanish flu Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dengue fever Virus Autism HIV Cytomegalovirus Epidemiology Yellow fever Tuberculosis Genetically modified food Sexually-transmitted infection Hepatitis C Antiviral drug Escherichia coli O157:H7 Vegetarianism Quarantine Marburg virus Louis Pasteur Vaccination Cervical cancer Computer virus Externality Medical analysis of circumcision Thimerosal Andrew Wakefield Vaccine controversy Bioterrorism Kashrut Common cold Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mathematical modelling in epidemiology Autism epidemic Safe trade Lyme disease Ferret Pandemic Food and Drug Administration Coeliac disease Hepatitis B Condom Precautionary principle Ulcerative colitis Allergy Lassa fever Tobacco smoking Tsetse fly Democracy Biological warfare Urinary incontinence HIV test Colorectal cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Jonas Salk Chagas disease Diphtheria

what are the symptoms of mono am i at risk i made out with this guy about weeks ago and tuesday morning i got really sick i'm still really sick now anyway the guy who i made out with he got sick tuesday morning too it turns out that he has mono am i at risk i didn't want to see a doctor because i feel too sick to leave the house i figured it was just a cold and would go away quickly what do you think mono is not treated with antibiotics as one person said a doctor will only prescribe antibiotics if they think you have a different bacterial infection at the same time or if they misdiagnose it the first time if you have mono and are on antibiotics call your doctor to ask whether or not you should finish the prescription never stop taking an antibiotic without a doctor telling you to do so if you do have a bacterial infection and you stop taking the antibiotics before finishing them all then the infection may still be there and may become resistant to the antibiotic you were taken you can then spread this resistant infection to others mono however is not caused by bacteria it is caused by a virus viruses and bacteria are completely different so the medications that kill bacteria are useless against viruses if your dog was hungry you would never think to give him plant fertilizer as food right you would realize that a dog and a daisy are completely different organisms and what's food for one is not going to work for the other the same goes for killing viruses and bacteria they're just as different from each other as plants and animals are taking antibiotics for viral infections will not help at all only use antibiotics for bacterial infections and always finish the entire prescription any other use only contributes to the growing problem of antibiotic resistant bacteria there are some anti viral medications for some viral diseases but many viral diseases are treated by alleviating the symptoms so the patient is more comfortable while their immune system fights off the virus for instance when i had mono swallowing was so painful that i couldn't eat or drink more than a couple of mouthfuls each day my doctor gave me low dose steroids to reduce the swelling so i wouldn't end up in the hospital for dehydration there are some slight risks to this as there is with any treatment so you'll have to talk to your doctor to find out what's best in your own specific situation  Diarrhea Group A streptococcal infection Infectious mononucleosis Tuberculosis Gonorrhoea Conjunctivitis Foodborne illness Crohn's disease Stomach cancer Rabies Antiviral drug Sexually-transmitted infection Cellulitis Escherichia coli O157:H7 Herpes simplex virus Pharyngitis Acne Cirrhosis Bacteria Ebola Medicine Anthrax Asthma Prostate cancer Infectious disease Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cytomegalovirus Nutrition Traditional Chinese medicine Smallpox Vitamin C Antiretroviral drug Hepatitis C Streptococcus pneumoniae Eczema Sickle-cell disease Legionellosis First aid Malaria HIV HIV test Hepatitis HIV vaccine Ulcerative colitis Kaposi's sarcoma H5N1 Penicillin Lyme disease Traumatic brain injury Clostridium difficile Allergy Marburg virus Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Biological warfare Cancer Helicobacter pylori Shrimp farm Leptospirosis Lung cancer Influenza Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Migraine Antibiotic resistance Fibromyalgia Cystic fibrosis Chemotherapy Dysentery Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Colorectal cancer Poliomyelitis Livestock Medical analysis of circumcision Mouth ulcer Diabetes mellitus Balance disorder Encephalitis Upper respiratory tract infection Iatrogenic Pelvic inflammatory disease Folic acid Gastroparesis Diseases of the honeybee Urinary incontinence Leukemia Bubonic plague

duodenal ulcer and its complications i've been recently diagnosed with a duodenal ulcer caused by a bactria called h plyori and possibly from partying too much long story short i went to the hospital because my stomach was bleeding from the inside it's been months since i've had anything alcoholic drink b c the doc said i should stay away from it for a while i was just wondering if anyone else had this before or do you think i can drink now helicobacter pylori is a common infection of the stomach that in addition to predisposing people to development of stomach and duodenal ulcers can infrequently cause stomach tumors both adenocarcinoma and malt when found in conjunction with a duodenal ulcer then h pylori is usually the culprit it is generally treated with a combination of medications usually at least two antibiotics amoxicillin clarithromycin metronidazole and a proton pump inhibitor e g omeprazole lansoprazole the most common prescription is prevpac which is a combination package of lanzoprazole amoxicillin and clarithromycin pills for which the patients would receive a single prescription and have one co pay depending on their insurance reasons your doctor recommended alcohol abstinence may be unrelated to your duodenal ulcer or due to possible interaction with the treatment her prescribed for your h pylori infection therefore the best way to proceed from here is to discuss this question with your doctor since you had a complication bleeding ulcer requiring hospitalization with your h pylri infection your doctor should also later check that the treatment was indeed successful and that you do not have a persistent or recrudescent h pylori infection in your stomach the easiest way to accomplish this nowadays to have your stool checked for h pylori antigen rather than checking for antibodies in your serum that can remain positive for a couple of years at least even after successful antibiotic treatment good luck  Pneumonia Esomeprazole Gastroesophageal reflux disease Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer Prostate cancer Colorectal cancer Coeliac disease Ulcerative colitis Esophageal cancer HIV test Crohn's disease Diarrhea Gonorrhoea Ranitidine Chronic fatigue syndrome Acute pancreatitis Lupus erythematosus Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cirrhosis Breast cancer COX-2 inhibitor Malaria Diclofenac Traumatic brain injury Proton pump inhibitor Psoriasis Group A streptococcal infection Immunosuppressive drug Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Hepatitis Multiple sclerosis First aid Homeopathy Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Lung cancer Health insurance Asthma Urinary incontinence Clinical depression Medicine Antidepressant Folic acid Breastfeeding Cystic fibrosis Malignant melanoma Paracetamol Penicillin Hypoglycemia Urea breath test Common cold Diabetes mellitus Pharmaceutical company Adjustable gastric band Hepatitis B Medical cannabis Barry Marshall Allergy Infectious mononucleosis Intravenous therapy Alcoholism AIDS Cytomegalovirus Turner syndrome Conjunctivitis Pharmacology Mouth ulcer Tuberculosis Syphilis Shock Bone marrow transplant Escherichia coli O157:H7 Medical analysis of circumcision Streptococcus pneumoniae Fecal incontinence Smallpox H2-receptor antagonist Antibiotic Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Paget's disease of bone Bipolar disorder Dexamethasone Campylobacteriosis Drug addiction Radiosurgery Growth hormone treatment Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Chlorpromazine Obstetrics Blood type Rabies Abortion Antiviral drug

is this herpes how did he get it please i never had any symptoms of herpes cold sores in my life my boyfriend and i kissed he is also my first kiss when he kissed he seemed like he had nothing on his lips or that showed any cold sore days later he got blisters on his lower lip he went to the doctor and told him he has a virus infection is it possibile that my boyfriend could have had a small blister on him and we both didn't recognize it so while kissing it must have spread we also kissed in the mean time he had it did i give it to him if i never had sex or kissed no one else but him and how is it possibile that i got nothing on me still please i need some serious answers cold sores oral herpes is most often caught as a baby or child from other children relatives kissing you by adulthood of the population have it but most people have no symptoms in fact of those with oral herpes have no symptoms if you have nothing on you and you kissed so close to him having an outrbeak on his lip a couple of days before if he had already had the virus then he would probably have been infectious at that point and since you didn't catch it off him and show no symptoms it is entirely possible that you gave it to him two days is around the minimum incubation period for the virus before he would get symptoms if you passed it on to him if you kissed while he had it and showed no symptoms yourself that means you kissed him when he was at his most infectious and didn't catch it which would indicate to me that you already had it yourself or you would have caught it when he was that infectious if you already have it even without symptoms you cannot catch it again it sounds most likely that you gave it to him by leaving high school of the population have oral herpes most catch it from other children or relatives kissing them when they are babies or small children and have no symptoms as adults so you don't have to have had sex or kissed anyone but him to have it my boyfriend actually remembers catching it as a year old by his auntie giving him a quick kiss on the lips a couple of days before but he is unusual to remember if it was your boyfriends first outbreak ever after you kissed him he might have had quite a few blisters or he might have experienced tingling on his lips in the weeks following or several outbreaks of blisters over a few months when the very first blisters appeared he might have felt like he had the flu or very tired and a bit unwell and had swollen and painful lymph nodes in his neck if he had these symptoms it is even more likely he had just caught the virus from you  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Group A streptococcal infection Herpes zoster Chronic fatigue syndrome Sexually-transmitted infection Influenza Ebola Mouth ulcer Oral sex Pharyngitis Spanish flu Cytomegalovirus Transmission (medicine) Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Common cold Pneumonia AIDS Virus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Smallpox Poliomyelitis Chickenpox Bubonic plague Prostate cancer Measles Chancroid Breastfeeding Cancer Marburg virus Psoriasis Hepatitis C HIV test Foodborne illness H5N1 HIV Avian influenza Leukemia Rabies Breast cancer Lyme disease First aid Echovirus Diarrhea Tuberculosis Vitamin C Multiple sclerosis Colorectal cancer Hepatitis Gonorrhoea Hodgkin's lymphoma Monkeypox Jam (TV series) Radiation therapy Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Rocky Mountain spotted fever Cephalic disorder Traumatic brain injury Neighbours Migraine Lymphatic system Black Death Kawasaki disease Infectious disease Coeliac disease Domestic rabbit Rotavirus Cancer of the larynx Pregnancy Malaria Equine conformation Cellulitis Child sexuality Humphrey Bogart Kodocha Gastroenteritis Body piercing Dengue fever Pandemic Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Roseola Oral cancer 1972 outbreak of smallpox in Yugoslavia Medicine Epilepsy
