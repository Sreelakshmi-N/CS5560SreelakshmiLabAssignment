are there any jimi hendrix like guitarists out there now a days just doesn't seem like there is as far as the younger generation indeed jimmy page is still alive his greatest influence for his performance is hendrix but if you're talking about the latest generation guitarists there isn't one who plays exactly like him because guitar's performance style has underwent various changes throughout the years mainly because of the new genres in rock and metal that've been created in the last years a slightly different guitarist but one of the greatest today is yngwie malmsteen who mostly plays neoclassical metal with unsurpassable speed precision and skill i would call him 'the modern jimi hendrix'  Yngwie J.
