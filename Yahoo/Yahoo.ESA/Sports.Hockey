goalie substitution does anyone know of a situation where an nhl team had to use a regular skater in net after losing both the starter back up goalie in the same game surely it must have happened but i can not find any record since most teams only carry goalies on their active roster i would assume this situation had happened in the long history of the nhl to rac how can they call up another goalie in the middle of a game i know of an very old incident when teams only carried one goalie and when he went down the team's coach put on the pads and played the team was the new york rangers and the coach was lester patrick teams are allowed to press into service when required an actually goalie who wasn't dressed to start the game i've heard them talk about this during a few different games i believe the team is given enough time to get another goalie to the rink if one is needed mind you they aren't going to be calling patrick roy it would end up being a junior or senior leaguer or perhaps even an minor leaguer if one can be found quickly in the playoffs many teams actually have a third goalie in the building ready to dress should he be needed  Ice hockey Montreal Canadiens Goaltender Detroit Red Wings 1992-93 NHL season National Hockey League Chicago Blackhawks Lacrosse Stanley Cup Jacques Plante New York Americans Playoff NHL series Roller hockey Toronto Maple Leafs Pittsburgh Penguins Boston Bruins Mario Lemieux New York Islanders Floorball National Hockey League All-Star Game New York Knicks 1985-86 NHL season 2003-04 NHL season Houston Astros Qu__bec Nordiques St. Louis Blues (hockey) Western Canada Hockey League Hartford Whalers Indiana Pacers Mark Messier Ottawa Senators Florida Panthers 2004-05 NHL lockout Overtime (ice hockey) Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl XXVII Florida Marlins Baseball New York Giants Seattle Mariners Jokerit Dominik Ha__ek Edmonton Oilers Minor league baseball Tampa Bay Lightning World Hockey Association Roger Neilson Pittsburgh Steelers Miami Dolphins 2002-03 NHL season Calgary Flames Toronto Blue Jays Kansas City Chiefs Miracle on Ice Water polo Super Bowl XXV 1957 World Series Buffalo Bills Grant Fuhr New York Yankees Washington Capitals Super Bowl IX Penalty (ice hockey) Negro league baseball Trenton Titans World Series New Jersey Nets Patrick Roy Oakland Athletics New Jersey Devils 2005 World Series Ottawa 67's Chicago White Sox Pittsburgh Pirates 1939-40 NHL season Toronto Raptors 1987-88 NHL season Satchel Paige International League Jarome Iginla Cleveland Indians Boston Red Sox The Mighty Ducks (movies) Detroit Tigers

a comparison of hockey eras here's why hockey is one of the best sports could wayne gretzky excel today would alexander ovechkin be the dominant goal scorer he is if he played alongside howie morenz how about the red wings' production line if steve yzerman was the center woul dit still be well productive the gist of my question is this how would stars and legends have performed in different eras of the nhl yes it is nearly impossible to make comparisons like that or is it we can dream can't we well snoop i don't think many of today's players could have played in the original six league there were ahl and senior teams better than at least half the nhl teams we have today and let's not forget in those days they wore less equipment than they do today i think half the europeans in the league would pack their bags and go home after a shift against any of the great lines of the s s and s put today's equipment on jacques plante and his gaa drops a full half goal do you really think jagr would line up against richard lach and blake without his helmet and visor not more than once would hasek face bobby hull's or bernie geoffrion's slapshot without a mask not a chance look at the numbers the entire nhl had players in those years today there are over players in the big league that means expanding from then to now in one swoop each team would get genuine big leaguers and come to think of it that's pretty close to what there is good players per team granted there are some players today that could have played in the original six league but not many no sir not many at all  Los Angeles Kings Hart Memorial Trophy Washington Capitals Art Ross Memorial Trophy Ice hockey Boston Bruins 2004-05 NHL lockout Wayne Gretzky 1992-93 NHL season Buffalo Sabres St. Louis Blues (hockey) National Hockey League Bernie Geoffrion Chicago Blackhawks Mario Lemieux New York Rangers Steve Yzerman Pittsburgh Penguins Jarom__r J__gr World Hockey Association NHL series Toronto Maple Leafs Philadelphia Flyers Phoenix Coyotes Alexander Ovechkin Calgary Flames Bobby Hull 1987-88 NHL season Edmonton Oilers Baseball Gordie Howe Stanley Cup Goaltender Mighty Ducks of Anaheim Goal (ice hockey) Ontario Hockey League Phil Esposito Sidney Crosby Brett Hull New York Islanders Tampa Bay Lightning 2003-04 NHL season Norway national football team 1959-60 NHL season Jacques Plante Carolina Hurricanes Vancouver Canucks Maurice Richard Mark Messier Winnipeg Jets Jari Kurri Vezina Trophy Captain (ice hockey) Lady Byng Memorial Trophy Hartford Whalers Ottawa Senators Playoff 50 goals in 50 games Playoff format Calder Memorial Trophy 2002-03 NHL season Michael Jordan National Football League Raymond Bourque 1985-86 NHL season Dominik Ha__ek Springfield Falcons Conn Smythe Trophy Blazers/Cowboys (WHA) New York Giants 1983 NHL Entry Draft The Mighty Ducks (movies) Mike Bossy San Francisco 49ers Alex Ferguson NHL Entry Draft NBA Finals Pavel Datsyuk Rugby league Bobby Orr Roller hockey Cam Neely Springfield Indians American football 2005-06 NHL season Miracle on Ice Don Cherry (hockey) Pittsburgh Steelers Western Canada Hockey League American Hockey League

buffalo sabres losses signings mainly what do you think about the sabres agreeing to vanek's high price salary no doubt he's a great player but he can't make up for drury briere and zubrus i think they should have let vanek go and started from the beginning by drafting a young crew and waiting a couple years pittsburgh did this and they are going to be very good this year we almost have to see how the season plays out to decide if it was a good deal or if they could have worked out a deal with drury they would have been able to let vanek go get young prospects and still have a somewhat decent team with the same amount of money it costs to keep vanek the oilers dont seem to be going anywhere this season so we could have gotten a top pick of the draft also tell me what you think about that and any other comments dealing with other deals management vanek has more upside then briere this is the second team that he has been on so the first team must not have seen much to trade him for chris gratton no less in the first place i really believe he was a product of the system he was in if vanke progresses like he has in the first two years his contract will be a bargain as for drury it wasn't about money for him the sabre's said that would match any contract it just sucked that the team he grew up loving wanted him keep in mine that every year the cap will rise so we haven't seen anything yet and when a player is in their last year of a contact its not in their best interest to sign a new deal without letting the market push their value up also like someone said the buffalo's farm team the rochester americans have plenty of talent  Buffalo Sabres National Football League Pittsburgh Penguins American Football League Los Angeles Clippers Salary cap Detroit Red Wings Pittsburgh Steelers Wayne Gretzky Mario Lemieux New England Patriots New York Giants Buffalo Bills AFL-NFL Merger National Hockey League Toronto Raptors Philadelphia Flyers Super Bowl XXVII Satchel Paige Boston Bruins Minor league baseball NFL Draft Pittsburgh Pirates New York Knicks National Basketball Association Oakland Athletics Reggie Jackson International League Cincinnati Bengals Sammy Sosa Boston Red Sox Tennessee Titans Microeconomics New York Islanders Indiana Pacers Carolina Panthers Continental Basketball Association Montreal Canadiens Poker jargon Negro league baseball Alex Rodriguez New York Jets Cleveland Browns Washington Capitals Anarchism and capitalism Qu__bec Nordiques Japanese baseball 2002-03 NHL season Reserve clause Dominik Ha__ek Newcastle United F.C.

does anyone know who k eptok is in sidney crosby's gatorade commercial i have reason to believe that k eptok could be lemieux gretzky or saku koivu lemieux or gretzky possibly because he had always looked up to them as a kid it may also be lemieux because it looks a lot like him and lemieux has been helping sidney in the nhl koivu because he does wear the number on his jersey for the montreal canadiens koivu was also one of crosby's favorite players as a kid people also believe that k eptok could translate into keep talking which could suggest that he may symbolize ovechkin who was crosby's matchup in their rookie seasons some people also believe that it could be kasparaitis because he did attempt to intimidate crosby in his first year it may also be kovalchuk who also attempted to intimidate crosby i know the commercial you're talking about the one where everyone throws there sticks into the middle during a game of street hockey he isn't actually anyone he may represent someone else i was always thinking of ovechkin but the russian guy was tall and scary but around the time of the commercial it was ovechkin who was considered crosby's biggest rival for the calder and there was debate over who was better so my answer is technically its no one but symbolically it might be ovechkin  Mario Lemieux Montreal Canadiens Sidney Crosby Alexander Ovechkin Pittsburgh Penguins Wayne Gretzky Saku Koivu Los Angeles Kings New York Rangers National Hockey League Washington Capitals 2004-05 NHL lockout Art Ross Memorial Trophy 1992-93 NHL season Edmonton Oilers Toronto Maple Leafs Maurice Richard Chicago Blackhawks 50 goals in 50 games Carolina Hurricanes NHL Entry Draft 1987-88 NHL season Boston Bruins Conn Smythe Trophy Calder Memorial Trophy 1988-89 NHL season 1985-86 NHL season Stanley Cup Hart Memorial Trophy Guy Lafleur Philadelphia Flyers Detroit Red Wings New York Giants Ottawa Senators Mats N__slund New Jersey Devils New York Islanders Buffalo Sabres Calgary Flames Overtime (ice hockey) 2003-04 NHL season Jarom__r J__gr Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy Peter ____astn__ National Hockey League All-Star Game 2004 World Cup of Hockey Captain (ice hockey) Trevor Linden Atlanta Thrashers San Jose Sharks NHL Plus/Minus Award Qu__bec Nordiques Jim Dowd (hockey player) National Hockey League rivalries Goal (ice hockey) Quebec Major Junior Hockey League Gordie Howe Steve Yzerman Western Canada Hockey League Hamilton Tigers Yao Ming Hockey Night in Canada October 2005 in sports 1924-25 NHL season Cam Neely Miracle on Ice Gilbert Perreault Newsy Lalonde Patrick Roy St. Louis Blues (hockey) Doug Gilmour Violence in ice hockey 1987 Canada Cup Ice hockey Colorado Avalanche Lady Byng Memorial Trophy Bernie Geoffrion Bobby Orr NHL series Cleveland Browns Florida Panthers New York Yankees Poker jargon Ed Belfour Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Joe Nieuwendyk Hockey Hall of Fame Super Bowl XXV Jari Kurri Dany Heatley National Basketball Association 1983 NHL Entry Draft World Hockey Association Pierre Dagenais

is there anything gary bettman has done that has helped the nhl i hear nothing but bad things about the guy so i ask if he has done even one thing that has helped the nhl well let me think he increased the annual revenues per team from mm in to mm and the nhlpa has benefitted greatly from this he facilitated the use of nhl players in the olympics he was instrumental in bringing the world ice hocey championships to canada in first time ever he has increased the exposure of the game in live nhl games were available in countries today they are shown in things he has been blamed for which he had no part ion the changing of the schedule the nhl adopted a division based schedule in years before his arrival changing the names of the divisions from historical names to geographic names this decision was made in by john ziegler i was on the committee loss of television revenue the nhl does not have a us network deal because us networks refuse to make decent bids nhl ratings in the us have been constant for over years long before bettman joined the league the fact is regardless of whoever is commissioner the ratings in the us aren't going to change unless the league becomes predominantly american in the last years as both the men and women's tennis tours have had the number of top americans decrease the ratings have decreased sharply this is a situation in most countries people prefer to watch their own am american wants to see tiger woods win the masters not mike weir and cbs has the viewership decline to prove it pete sampras should be winning wimbledon not federer i have been involved with the nhl in one way or another since i have met clarence campbell john ziegler gil stein and gary bettman i have also met alan eagleson bob goodenow and ted saskins i have taken part in several dozen nhl committees i know how the league operates the nhl governors run the nhl gary bettman is their spokesman gary bettman is responsible for ensuring that the owners wishes are carried out he only gets a say when their is a tie and that never happens if you get a chance to talk to the majority of players and owners bettman is great for the game if you get a chance to talk to chris chelios you will realize that nobody is good for the game gary bettman did not cause the lockout the owners voted to keep the players out bettman helped the owners and the players make a lot of money but no commissioner in the world is going to make hockey a financial windfall in nashville like it is in toronto the rules changes are chosen by a group of players and owners not by gary bettman the cities chosen for expansion were chosen by the owners not gary bettman during the stanley cup final bill daly mentioned that the league owners have approved the addition of more teams to lubers the nhl governors will gladly increase the number of games they play against the other conference if the number of games are increased the nhlpa will not allow an increase in the number of games and requested a reduction in the number of games during the most recent cba talks as the number of teams increase for better or worse and the number of games stay constant there will be give and take in how the schedule is created for most teams their division geographic rivals pull in the most fans and in the owners adopted this mentality and for the last years teams have been playing the majority of games against their own division during the gm meetings in february this was brought up for a vote again and the owners voted against the idea again your last two points taking a step back and the lack of needing a push into the southern us aren't bettman specific i agree that there is little or no reason to expand to markets where they currently have little or no interest however as long as there are people like jeremy jacobs and ed snider everybody in winnipeg is already a hockey fan we gain no extra fans moving there the nhl will continue to expand into markets where there is somebody with a big fat pocketbook who will line the owners pockets this will happen regardless of who the commissioner is unfortunately the number of darryl katz's' and james balsillie's in canada with the money to purchase a team is very few and those with it are reluctant to spend it on a hockey team it is very sad when you have a team from one of the largest tv markets in the us and a network with coverage nbc and the number of viewers in canada exceeds the number of viewers in the us the nhl governors had everything they wanted a large market us team full continental coverage and still no viewers to trombass what's wrong with playing each team home and away ask ed snider he put forward the schedule idea and james karmanos seconded it and the vote was supposedly overwhelmingly in favour it's all about money pittsburgh will draw more fans to philadelphia than will san jose anaheim will always get more fans when the kings come to town personally i would prefer to see a more balanced schedule and have the top teams make the playoffs i would love to see a montreal toronto cup final or detroit chicago or calgary edmonton or rangers flyers etc none of which can happen under the current system  Andre Agassi Super Bowl Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Toronto Blue Jays Pittsburgh Steelers Major League Baseball Cleveland Browns Detroit Tigers American Hockey League Tennis

rangers where do you think they rank among the all time best teams i mean im a rangers fan so im biased but i honestly think that they were so deep and so talented that besides the dynasty teams they gotta be on top what do you think the new york oiler hawks neil smith mortgaged the future to build that team which had one shot at lifting the cup great roster but stacked with mercenaries that can't be compared to any dynasty in retrospect the price might have been too high but that is neither here nor there they won and as a native new yorker i was ecstatic the subsequent lockout and keenan's antics took a lot of the lustre off but the true beginning of the end came with the trading of zubov in he and nedved were moved for robitaille and samuelsson because messier didn't like the two zubov who took a numbing injection for half the playoffs was deemed soft because he chose to attend to his injured wrist the following season that was one of the worst trades in team history and also shone a light on the 'messiah's true colors what i take from that season are the contributions of home grown talents like leetch zubov kovalev and richter how he can be called overrated is beyond me along with the character and grit of adam graves of course i'll never forget matteau matteau matteau or any of the other fond memories of that spring summer it just seems that every unseemly act that followed the cup win magnified the underlying mercenary theme of that championship club my emotional issues aside i'd take the avalanche either cup year over that ' team not to mention detroit's own all star squad in ' the pens in the early 's were also pretty impressive in fact that ' heartbreaker against pittsburgh was one of the catalysts leading to smith's decision to collect a slew of hired guns  Stanley Cup Los Angeles Kings Pittsburgh Penguins Pittsburgh Steelers Detroit Red Wings Boston Bruins Overtime (ice hockey) Chicago Blackhawks Philadelphia Flyers Oakland Athletics Sergei Zubov Montreal Canadiens Edmonton Oilers Wayne Gretzky Washington Capitals Qu__bec Nordiques New York Islanders Cincinnati Bengals Orlando Magic Calgary Flames Buffalo Bills National Hockey League rivalries Los Angeles Clippers 2003-04 NHL season New York Knicks New York Giants World Series National Hockey League Houston Astros Tennessee Titans Detroit Tigers National Basketball Association New Jersey Nets Mark Messier Brian Leetch Colorado Avalanche New England Patriots International League Jacksonville Jaguars National Hockey League All-Star Game Chicago White Sox Norway national football team NBA Finals Texas Rangers (baseball) St. Louis Blues (hockey) St. Louis Rams New York Americans Cleveland Browns Florida Marlins Toronto Maple Leafs 1987-88 NHL season Alex Ferguson Cleveland Indians New York Jets New York Yankees R.S.C.

hockey tryouts im really nervous about these tryouts any advice for a goalie to impress the coaches during tryouts so your going to be nervous like anyone if a few goals get passed you just think about stopping the next puck not the one that let in also if anyone cheers or thinks their goal was the best you know in your head you'll stop them next time don't let anybody get under your skin or try to mess you up show confidence and calmness in the net a calm goalie is miikka kiprusoft look at him hes so calm and forgets about the past try to do what he does but obviously not in the nhl also make sure you are not scared of the puck a scared goalie will never get what they'd like if your scared it means you don't want to stop the puck you want to see if fly pas you and thats a goal stay calm and cool don't be scared of players or the puck and try your best remember your angles to the player and make sure you know in the back of your head where the net is and always stay square to the shooter remember your challenges and how far you are out on the crease the right distance from the net depends on the shot as you'd probably know and if you have the right distance chances are the puck is going to hit you not the back of the net good luck in your tryouts d  Goaltender Goal (ice hockey) Hockey rink Centre (ice hockey) Miracle on Ice Roller hockey Hockey puck Gerry Cheevers New York Rangers 2005-06 NHL season Los Angeles Kings Detroit Red Wings 1992-93 NHL season Jacques Plante Floorball New York Americans Ice Hockey (video game) Official (ice hockey) Goalkeeper Montreal Canadiens Lacrosse Doug Harvey Billy Smith San Jose Sharks Wayne Gretzky Pittsburgh Steelers Boston Bruins Winger (ice hockey) National Hockey League Peter Bondra Social rule Toronto Maple Leafs Water polo Qu__bec Nordiques Hartford Whalers Grant Fuhr National Hockey League All-Star Game Blitzball Overtime (ice hockey) Volleyball Glossary of American football Instant replay Rob Ramage Hockey stick Florida Panthers The Mighty Ducks (movies) Fast bowling Mark Messier Philadelphia Flyers Edmonton Oilers Field hockey Georges Vezina Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Roger Neilson Pavel Datsyuk Jokerit New York Knicks Miikka Kiprusoff The Contender (television series) The Mighty Ducks (animated series) Mario Lemieux Tampa Bay Lightning Stanley Cup Satchel Paige St. Louis Blues (hockey) Press Your Luck Cleveland Browns Indoor soccer Ottawa Senators Baseball Peter Shilton Blazers/Cowboys (WHA) Dany Heatley Snooker Craps Doug Gilmour Bobby Hull Batting (cricket) Martin Gelinas Ken Daneyko Reservoir Dogs Rink hockey Phoenix Coyotes 1985-86 NHL season Michael Larson Columbus Blue Jackets Don Cherry (hockey) Sandy Koufax Colorado Avalanche Phil Esposito Art__rs Irbe Jeopardy!

philadelphia flyers playoff contenders seems like they are to me now sure last year they sucked but that's last year they did a really good job in the off season i think they'll be a playoff contender do you they sure will make the playoffs you can't ignore what homer has done to change the team around i think they will make it into the playoffs easily however i dont think they are going to be a high seed it all depends how well the new players adapt with each others playing style i think their chemistry will be good now i dont think they will make it to the finals they still have areas to improve on but you still have to remember that they are in a rebuilding process its still going to be amazing how well they will bounce back from their worst season in franchise history though and the person who said the flyers have to contend with the isles and the devils is a moron both teams had a terrible offseason also by saying they rebuilt the team the wrong way through trades and not by prospects is wrong most of the players aquired through these trades are still very young and not to mention a very good prospect was aquired with ryan parent also you can't forget they have claude giroux and steve downie moving up fast through the system who will be huge players for the team with all that being said the next few years will be exciting to watch the flyers and they will be playoff contenders for years to come  Philadelphia Flyers Los Angeles Kings Qu__bec Nordiques Orlando Magic New York Knicks Indiana Pacers Chicago Bulls Pittsburgh Steelers New England Patriots Utah Jazz St. Louis Rams New Jersey Nets Toronto Raptors Los Angeles Clippers Pittsburgh Penguins Detroit Red Wings Oakland Athletics World Series Seattle Mariners Cleveland Browns St. Louis Blues (hockey) National Hockey League rivalries Houston Rockets New Jersey Devils Vancouver Canucks Playoff Minnesota Timberwolves Florida Marlins Miami Dolphins Phoenix Suns Ottawa Senators Boston Bruins Washington Capitals San Francisco Giants New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets San Francisco 49ers Chicago Blackhawks 2002-03 NHL season Edmonton Oilers Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim San Antonio Spurs National Football League National Basketball Association Montreal Canadiens Florida Panthers Buffalo Sabres Toronto Maple Leafs Cleveland Indians Los Angeles Dodgers Chicago Cubs Baltimore Ravens Atlanta Flames Calgary Flames 1957 World Series Tampa Bay Lightning Steve Nash Boston Red Sox Carolina Panthers Canterbury Bulldogs Philadelphia Phillies Toronto Blue Jays Cleveland Cavaliers Atlanta Hawks Buffalo Bills Chicago White Sox New York Yankees Montr__al Expos Sammy Sosa Blazers/Cowboys (WHA) Super Bowl XXVII New York Mets San Jose Sharks New York Americans Arizona Diamondbacks Minnesota Vikings Leicester City F.C.

where do the saint louis blues stand are the blues done with free agency are they getting ready for a trade so far i think the blues are off to a slow start tkachuk is a joke and a waste of money and kariya can only be as good as the players around him weight is o k but no superstar and legace is no marty broduer so where do the blues stand going into the new season see above honestly though the blues arent at a complete loss but they are not quite at their year they have a lot of quality young players and a bright future to look forward to manny legace right now has to prove that he is a quality netminder yes true in detroit he was great but is he saying he cant win without quality around him all the time realistically they pieces arent going to fit they dont have a lot of scoring punch and just kariya can not carry this team they have a young defesive core but they need a littl more experience and some solid offense in front of then to win games i think they did a good job by picking up toivenen he is going to be good but isnt devolped enough yet here is what they need some strong centermen another winger and a leadership defenseman trades would most liekely be the answer but i thin st louis will look at that later in the season they have to see what they are putting on the ice first i think they should look at trying to get a guy like norstrom out of dallas where they are over stocked and solid defnsemen a steven weiss or nathan horton out of florida and a ryan smyth could place then where they want to be sorry but this year is not their year and with a division of detroit and nashville is going to make it very tough also dont be suprised if chicago pulls it together this year they are young and talented and almost have all the right pieces  Detroit Red Wings St. Louis Blues (hockey) New York Giants Boston Bruins Manny Legace 2003-04 NHL season Detroit Tigers Chicago Blackhawks Pittsburgh Steelers World Series 2002-03 NHL season New England Patriots Toronto Blue Jays Toronto Raptors St. Louis Rams Montreal Canadiens New York Knicks Boston Red Sox Toronto Maple Leafs Pittsburgh Penguins Cleveland Browns New York Islanders Indiana Pacers Miami Dolphins Chicago White Sox Wayne Gretzky Buffalo Bills 1992-93 NHL season Stanley Cup San Francisco 49ers Atlanta Flames Chicago Bulls Oakland Athletics Colorado Avalanche Utah Jazz National Football League Dallas Cowboys St. Louis Cardinals Washington Capitals Carolina Panthers Mighty Ducks of Anaheim Newcastle United F.C.

field hockey questions hi i'm staring field hockey in a few weeks and i have some questionsss for starters how do you play is it like lacrosse except on the ground is theyre hitting whats better a wood or composite stick why whats a good not tooo expensive brand and anything i should know you could write too thanks so much it is similar to lacrosse but i'm not sure if i'd say it's lacrosse on the ground there are players from each team on the field at any given time you have field players and one goalie the purpose is to use passing and drives hard hits to get the ball into the cage once you get down on to the other teams half of the field you will notice there is a yd circle you must be inside of this circle in order to score a goal also if you are inside this circle and a defensive foul occurs your team will get a corner a corner gives your team an advantage and is usually a great time to try and score no there is not hitting if you hit you will get carded by the ref carding consists of green warning yellow kicked out of game for mins red kicked out of entire game the type of sticks totally depend on your personal choice generally composites and made to drive better and that is more necessary for defensive players however i am a forward and i use a composite stick i recommend getting either a tk or a gray's they are both really good brands and you can get some pretty good cheap sticks whatever you do i would say stay away from brine their sticks tend to not last as long and are not worth the money you should have the following on the first day of tryouts cleats sneakers shin guards mouth guard stick practice ball these are just the necessities and you will know more after the first day good luck and i wish you a great season  Field hockey Lacrosse Ice hockey Water polo Softball Glossary of American football American football Football (soccer) Billiards Floorball New York Giants Goaltender Canadian football Roller hockey Indoor soccer Volleyball Rugby league Goalkeeper Snooker National Football League Lore Rugby union positions National Football League Ultimate (sport) Poker jargon Batting (cricket) Tag Rugby union Broomball Golf Comparison of Canadian and American football Tris Speaker Goal (ice hockey) Football (soccer) positions Super Bowl XXXIV American football strategy Super Bowl X Super Bowl XXVII 2005 World Series Paintball National Hockey League Fast bowling Pittsburgh Steelers 1957 World Series Cricket Table tennis Super Bowl IX Hurling Origins of baseball Sandy Koufax Super Bowl I Super Bowl XVIII Rink hockey Super Bowl XII GunBound The Joker's Wild Super Bowl XVII Cleveland Browns Table football World Series Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XXIII St. Louis Cardinals Laws of cricket Hockey rink Super Bowl XXVI Playoff Super Bowl XXV Babe Ruth Harrow Football Chicago White Sox Women's lacrosse Carolina Panthers San Francisco 49ers Teen Girl Squad Fielding (cricket) Ty Cobb San Francisco Giants Baseball scorekeeping Arena football Major Indoor Soccer League New England Patriots Toronto Maple Leafs Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XXXIII Polo Super Bowl XXXII Michael Jordan Bicycle lighting Four square Chicago Blackhawks Football Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Los Angeles Clippers

alright here's an inovative idea towards the ol' which teams should move question might take some time list all teams in order of likelihood to move starting with being the highest think this might help things http sports espn go com nhl attendance year here's my list nashville florida panthers phoenix carolina columbus devils washington kings ducks even if they just won the cup blues atlanta boston pittsburgh th in attendance san jose islanders hawks avs stars tampa nd in home attendance ahem sabers oilers vancouver philly minnesota flames no real order for these last five they would never move ottawa ny rangers toronto wings habs guys the idea was that u would plan out all teams as well if ur gonna sit here and be a critic about mine then make our own as well let me do this a bit differently no team that has won a cup has moved since the great depression when the original sens moved to st louis fact so i'll rank the teams that have not won a cup the rest go into the bottom section with no rankings as teams that will not move move rankings florida panthers nashville coyotes thrashers capitals kings blue jackets if they keep up their current level of play sens wild sharks blues canucks sabres will not move canadians leafs bruins red wings rangers chicago islanders oilers flames devils stars hurricanes lighting ducks avalanche penguins flyers comprehede carolina has high attendance just so you know you're pretty far off base in some of your projections you see teams have historical values to and even if they don't' draw in one year or so it's often because the team is under performing things change year to year the longer a team has been in one place the less likely it is to move and right now it doesn't look like nay teams are moving anytime soon  NHL Entry Draft Wildwing ECHL October 2005 in sports National Hockey League Calder Memorial Trophy Expansion Team Carlton the Bear Harvey the Hound Violence in ice hockey Stanley Cup Hart Memorial Trophy New York Islanders 1972 NHL Amateur Draft Youppi Calgary Flames Sparky the Dragon Wayne Gretzky Boston Bruins Nickname Presidents' Trophy Florida Panthers Fin the Whale Atlanta Thrashers Conn Smythe Trophy 1992-93 NHL season 1985-86 NHL season Jack Adams Award San Jose Sharks September 2005 in sports NHL Plus/Minus Award 1978-79 NHL season 1970 NHL Amateur Draft National Hockey League All-Star Game 1971 NHL Amateur Draft World Series Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy Art Ross Memorial Trophy Vezina Trophy Washington Capitals St. Louis Blues (hockey) New Jersey Devils December 2004 in sports Ottawa 67's Mario Lemieux London Knights Scotty Bowman Vancouver Canucks James Norris Memorial Trophy Carolina Hurricanes Colorado Avalanche June 2004 in sports Edmonton Oilers 1969 NHL Amateur Draft November 2004 in sports Paul Coffey Patrick Lalime January 2005 in sports Mike Vernon Ottawa Senators Esa Tikkanen Atlanta Flames Pittsburgh Penguins Houston Astros Carolina Panthers Sports rivalry Playoff Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Tampa Bay Lightning Qu__bec Nordiques Mighty Ducks of Anaheim

more inter conference rivalries what do you think this seems like a moving target and thousands of opinions but either way i say that the current schedule is setup too heavily in favoring playing teams in one's division too many times what if played every team in opposite conference twice h a games play every team in own conference but not division times h a games play every team in division times games total of i know your first argument is that there wouldn t be enough rivalries within the division but you d breed a better playoff team wouldn t you first the game series within a division would make it easier to determine a tie breaker plus you d have a better gauge gage for how healthy a team is because they ve played a nice robust slice of the other nhl teams the standings would speak for themselves you wouldn t be caught up in arguments about who s better a team would be measured against its success against a better representative slice of the entire nhl not just its division besides i m sick of always seeing the same teams times a year while we don t get to even see some of the best teams in the nhl at all for any given year what do you think you'd also standardize and protect against paper division champions who get stomped on during the playoffs and you d also justify w the seed may have a lower point total than the seed because they were the best of their division in playing the whole nhl sgoldperson reminds me of something that i had forgotten to write it would also help balance the difference between the east s and west s travel schedule the east has the luxury of staying within their own time zone and traveling relatively less thus one could argue that their endurance is not tested as much great idea i like it i think there are too many games within the division it's meant to drive ticket sales the odd number of home and away games within the division can be influenced by the season record between the teams or it could alternate from year to year nice job  Playoff National Hockey League National Football League Playoff format National Basketball Association New York Giants Boston Bruins Los Angeles Kings 2002-03 NHL season Pittsburgh Steelers Cincinnati Bengals 2003-04 NHL season New York Knicks 1987-88 NHL season Montreal Canadiens New York Rangers San Jose Sharks Cleveland Browns National Hockey League All-Star Game Detroit Red Wings 2005-06 NHL season Mario Lemieux Wild card Chicago Blackhawks Calgary Flames San Francisco Giants New York Americans Toronto Maple Leafs Miami Dolphins Ottawa Senators International League National Hockey League rivalries Major League Baseball Chicago Cubs Kansas City Chiefs 2004-05 NHL lockout Philadelphia Flyers New York Yankees St. Louis Cardinals New England Patriots Buffalo Bills Houston Astros Hartford Whalers 1988-89 NHL season Bowl Championship Series Chinese Basketball Association Edmonton Oilers NBA Finals Oakland Athletics St. Louis Rams Carolina Hurricanes Wayne Gretzky Ice hockey Houston Rockets Philadelphia Eagles Washington Capitals New York Jets Super Bowl XXXI Bundesliga (football) Atlantic Coast Conference The Football League Indiana Pacers American football Indianapolis Colts New York Islanders Super Bowl Qu__bec Nordiques Buffalo Sabres Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl XXII Monday Night Football Donovan McNabb College football Super Bowl XXVII Nashville Predators New Jersey Nets Baseball 1924-25 NHL season 1918-19 NHL season Oakland Raiders Tampa Bay Lightning American Football League Chicago Bulls Sudden death Boston Red Sox 1992-93 NHL season 2005 World Series Atlanta Flames Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.

what should it take for me to become a nhl fan again ok i want people to understand where i'm coming from here up until the ' lockout i loved the nhl i still watch hockey at the junior a and high school level here and it's an awesome sport after the lockout i was pissed off as regardless of right or wrong they had two years to figure out how to split money between the owners and players without having to destroy an entire season to do it when jeremy roenick made the comment that all americans should kiss his ass regarding blame that moment turned me off right there since that day i have not watched the nhl on television or in person where i live we have an ahl franchise and i refuse to go to those games i love hockey don't get me wrong but when we've seen labor issues in the other three major sports i'm just fed up i want to be an nhl fan again but i'm still furious what should it take for me to become a fan again one thing for sure another lockout can't happen the best way is to ease yourself into going back to the games go to the game with an open mind as though you are discovering hockey for the first time a perfect example would be my feelings after the last baseball strike in i was upset that the clowns who run baseball cancelled the world series a contest the montreal expos would have won in seven games over the cleveland indians i was even angrier that it was all about money i was at the time and swore up and down that i would never go to another baseball game then one afternoon in my mom had the day off from work i was having a bad day myself so to cheer me up she picked me up from school and drove me to tiger stadium which is a hour away from my home with her help she was able to get me watching baseball again initially i didn't want to even walk in the ballpark but after picking up a few baseball items and realizing that this was one of the coolest things my mom ever did for me i was okay over time i would go to more games then i was fully following baseball again trust me when i say this you will enjoy the nhl again there is so much you're missing out on just ease into being a nhl fan again you will not regret it  Major League Baseball National Hockey League Montreal Canadiens World Series Playoff Stanley Cup International League Chicago Blackhawks Wayne Gretzky Ty Cobb Sports timeline Boston Bruins Toronto Maple Leafs Babe Ruth 1994 baseball strike National Hockey League All-Star Game Ice hockey Salary cap Los Angeles Kings Reggie Jackson Detroit Tigers Detroit Red Wings National Football League Edmonton Oilers New York Islanders Ottawa Senators Pittsburgh Pirates New York Americans Pittsburgh Penguins Washington Nationals Seattle Mariners Tampa Bay Lightning Vancouver Canucks Major professional sports league Oakland Athletics Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Toronto Blue Jays St. Louis Cardinals Los Angeles Dodgers Satchel Paige Calgary Flames Tris Speaker New York Mets Washington Capitals Shaggy dog story Hamilton Tigers Montr__al Expos Western Canada Hockey League NHL series Japanese baseball MLB on NBC Springfield Indians Negro league baseball Major League Baseball All-Star Game 1992-93 NHL season Baltimore Orioles Texas Rangers (baseball) San Diego Padres 2003-04 NHL season Pittsburgh Pirates (NHL) Dallas Stars Playoff format Florida Marlins Philadelphia Phillies Carolina Hurricanes National Hockey League rivalries September 2004 in sports Cincinnati Reds Los Angeles Clippers San Jose Sharks 1919 World Series American Football League Hank Aaron New York Rangers MLB on FOX Troy Glaus November 2004 in sports 1981 baseball strike Qu__bec Nordiques Maurice Richard August 2005 in sports Mighty Ducks of Anaheim

what percentage of hockey players have lost some teeth playing hockey i heard once it was or something erica i'm gonna think of some really good 'pink spaceship' questions just for you while it was true at one time that players lost teeth sooner or later i think you will find that since most young players have to wear not only a helmet but a full face shield until they are out of junior iit's hard to knock out a guys chiclets through a cage many nhlers today also use an internal guard which can protect them to some extent it's the same kind of guard used in boxing and the martial arts another thing to consider is that modern dentistry can replace teeth so those partials or plates are a thing of a past and since hockey players make good dough they can get their smile fixed up for those post game interviews i played over twenty years and never lost a tooth i broke my arm had a concussion and had my nose flattened on two occasions but hockey never caused me to lose a tooth i did break a tooth once on an extraordinarily hard corn pop though  National Hockey League All-Star Game Goaltender Poker jargon Nine Inch Nails Baseball Floorball American football Tooth The Legend of Zelda series enemies Martial art Wayne Gretzky Armour Softball Tris Speaker Roller hockey Mixed martial arts Tooth enamel Los Angeles Clippers Stanley Cup Lacrosse RuneScape economy Mario Lemieux Professional wrestling match types Norway national football team Boxing New York Knicks Shen Gong Wu Andr__s Galarraga Jackass: The Movie Pittsburgh Steelers Ice Hockey World Championships Glossary of American football Tic-Tac-Dough Water polo Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Chris Benoit Happy Tree Friends Helmet Chicago (band) Trapping Fighting in ice hockey Equine conformation Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Glen Jacobs Fast bowling The Ashlee Simpson Show Ontario Hockey League Toronto Maple Leafs Goalkeeper Rachel Corrie Shawn Michaels Gordie Howe Metroid Prime Xiaolin Showdown Manhunt (video game) Star Trek Customizable Card Game Motorcycle helmet Violence in sports Princess Zelda RuneScape quests Doom enemies Pete Sampras Kurt Angle Salute Unreal Hockey puck Violence in ice hockey Domestic rabbit Tommy Smith Violin Lottie Dod 2002-03 NHL season Mask Tire Tetrapod Jennifer Lopez Hun-Apu Western Canada Hockey League Mario Kart 64 Bob and George Springfield Indians Montreal Canadiens Social rule Houston Rockets Team Fortress Classic Laws of cricket Blood (computer game) Table tennis Conker's Bad Fur Day 2004-05 NHL lockout Los Angeles Kings Sidney Crosby 1992-93 NHL season New England Patriots Final Fantasy magic

what about hockey makes you love the game so much i know there's so much to love i'm a young guy and i read this somewhere and thought it was perfect most people just see the outside but i wrote this as i really thought about what i wanted a lot of people wonder why i do what i do its because of days spent on the ice crazy parties i missed weekend hang outs blown hours of hard work tons of sweat never ending plane rides late night bus trips not getting the girl because you didnt have enought time to spend with her at times wanting to give it all up being on the road for your birthday leaving the day after christmas for some tournament missing school vacations and summer break to try out for teams moving to a different state just because the teams better tears blood shed broken bones snapped twigs trying to explain your game to your friends at school who have no idea what youre talking about losing friends because u have practice the day of their birthday would i change any of it no way why because theres no better feeling in the world than when u come back to the bench and your family not your parents and sister but your brothers who r there to congratulate u after a sweet dangle then a snipe or a sick dish hangin out with your buddies in the locker room hotel or just chillin at the rink sharing let downs and set backs with your teammates because the reward for that big win will be so much better lookin forward to tournaments so you can see some of your best friends who live thousands of miles away and then beat the shit out of them in the corners for a loose puck to set up your teammate in front of the net for the game winner in overtime you can tell these guys anything because you know they feel the same way and wont tell anyone people wonder why we do it its because when youre at the rink thats the time when nothing else matters the only thing you think about is how to beat the defenseman or what your coach is yelling at you to do but all of this is done so that one day we might be able to lift that trophy maybe the national championship four nations cup a gold medal at the olympics or maybe that dream of one day being handed the stanley cup after you've battled for games and then game playoff set after another thats why i do it it's kinda long but worth it to read sidney crosby of the pittsburgh penguins he might just break some of wayne gretzk'y records think of gretzky's goals in one season is that an achievable goal maybe not how about his assists in a season quite possible if evgeni malkin plays with him on the same shift all the time gretzky's points is a very realistic goal only if the penguins can run up the score like those oilers did it's highly unlikely the penguins will ever score goals in season like the oilers did in but if crosby's ice time increases to say something like minutes a game and plays the pk then yes its quite possible that some of gretzky's records are in jeopardy thats what i love about sid the kid we are living through history right now don't miss it other things i love about hockey bodychecks and wizardry with the puck gotta love the finesse combined with the bone rattling hits overtime in playoff hockey especially double triple or even quadruple overtime those games are fun hot dogs and beer at the game i know they are expensive but big deal if you go to the game why not enjoy yourself and eat something special and i don't mean munching on peanuts lol beer and hot dogs are perfect for any hockey game women dancing showing pierced belly button at the game and their boobs jumping up and down now that is appealing especially when your team is up and the girls are gone wild lightens up the atmosphere  Pittsburgh Steelers FA Cup New York Islanders Cincinnati Bengals Miracle on Ice World Series Cleveland Browns Buffalo Sabres Edmonton Oilers St. Louis Blues (hockey) Overtime (ice hockey) Mark Messier 1987-88 NHL season Playoff National Hockey League rivalries Sports timeline Norway national football team Washington Capitals NBA Finals Calgary Flames Gordie Howe Hartford Whalers Poker jargon Philadelphia Flyers Miami Dolphins Jarom__r J__gr New England Patriots Art Ross Memorial Trophy 1988-89 NHL season Goal (ice hockey) Playoff format International League Michael Jordan Vancouver Canucks National Football League Colorado Avalanche Carolina Panthers Raymond Bourque December 2004 in sports October 2005 in sports Ty Cobb Atlanta Flames Jari Kurri ESPN25 Al Michaels January 2005 in sports Volleyball National Hockey League All-Star Game Alex Ferguson Super Bowl XXVII Shawn Michaels Rugby union San Jose Sharks 2002-03 NHL season Blackburn Rovers F.C.
