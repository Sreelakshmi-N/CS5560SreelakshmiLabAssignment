my newt has a rock stuck to his foot what should i do and this seems weird it's making it hard for him to swim oh and another question where doesn't the slim come from and why is it there he just smeared some onto the side of the tank and there's some on the stones what's going on is it stress i just got this guy today so i took him out of the tank and looked at his foot i think he might be injured what looked like a rock felt the same has his skin is there anything i can do to help him the slim thing is shedding when a newt sheds either it will eat its own disarded skin or another will eat it sometimes a newt will try to eat the skin while it is still on another newt's body this action is helpful because it aids in removing the skin some newts seem to hate shedding some don't mind one of mine rubs up against rocks and things in his aquarium to get it all off himself as for his foot problem do not simply cut off his foot they can feel pain and their regrowth process is a long one trust me one of my newts lost a foot due to infection and it never grew back to its full size if you can not actually see the stone do not attempt to remove it if you can see the stone remove it with tweezer then put some bactine on it by the sounds of it though he may just have a sore if you see an pink tissue you will need to ensure it does not get infected do not use any oitments or sprays with painkillers in them or are harsh such as rubbing alcohol it could kills him follow this link for more information on how to help your newt http www caudata org cc articles sores shtml  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Drill bit Cancer Callus Psoriasis Equine conformation Herpes simplex virus Domestic rabbit Common cold Mattress Massage Tattoo Fecal incontinence The Marshall Mathers LP Prostate cancer Breastfeeding Swimming Acne Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fugu Shaggy dog story Gout Theory of conduct Textile manufacturing Scarification Traumatic brain injury Wound Baldness treatments Tarantula Intersex surgery Chronic fatigue syndrome Buddy Guy Radiation therapy Diving Crash test dummy Menstrual cup YuYu Hakusho Iggy Pop Scientology beliefs and practices 613 mitzvot Elephant Weight training Chicken Hyperthermia Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina United States House of Representatives Moult Kurt Angle Diving suit Decompression sickness Domain Name System Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Manicure Skin Vampire Curling First aid Anthrax Fancy rat Bedsore Otitis externa Non-native pronunciations of English Blood (computer game) Aliens (1986 film) Hulk (comics) Discworld gods Time Out of Mind Capital punishment Suicide methods Childbirth Boom Town (Doctor Who) Blonde on Blonde Stopping power Piccolo Junior Saga Smallpox Jackass: The Movie Blood on the Tracks Land mine Skinny Puppy Body piercing Cindy Sheehan Buddhism Opportunity rover Trench warfare The Legend of Zelda series enemies Adjustable gastric band Pain Domestic violence Dualism (philosophy of mind) Infidels Nine Inch Nails Earring Terminal ballistics Jellyfish

how can i get the humidity up in my chinese water dragon tank i need to be between how can i get it up to there now its like it needs to get higher humidity humidity should be about even with a water container in the cage this can be difficult to maintain i have live pothos and dracenae plants in my cage planted in soil so watering and misting these plants also helps to provide a humid atmosphere you should get a gage that measures the humidity try to mist the enclosure twice a day if you are really having problems keeping the humidity above or higher try covering part of the top of the enclosure if it has a screen cover you could put a piece of plexiglass or even saran wrap or foil over part of the opening this should help a bit but by all means never cover the whole top of the enclosure there must always be air circulating in the cage some people feel that maintaining a humid environment is not necessary i do not feel this way water dragons are from a tropical humid climate and being kept in the harsh warm dry conditions of captivity can be harmful to your dragons health iguana's also come from tropical humid areas and it has been found that if they are kept in captivity in a too dry enclosure they will more easily become dehydrated once an iguana becomes dehydrated the kidneys start to become affected many iguana's die every year from kidney failure some of these deaths are the result of animal protein in their diet and some of these deaths are caused by chronic dehydration while iguana's and water dragons come from different areas of the world i feel that their habitat and living environment are very similar please mist your cages once or twice a day and make every effort to maintain a proper humidity level for your dragons sake his life span could be affected as a result of low humidity levels http www triciaswaterdragon com  Hamster Aquarium Carnivorous plant Humidity Global warming and agriculture Fancy rat Kidney Hiking Diabetes mellitus Dialysis Climate of the United Kingdom Dehydration Hydroponics Gal__pagos Islands Tropical cyclone Carbon dioxide National Weather Service Weight training Global climate model Solar power Cannabis cultivation Sauna Ecology of Hong Kong El Ni__o Geography of Spain Effects of global warming Solar variation Water vapor Florida Keys Wind power Biome Air conditioning Asthma Deforestation Energy development Prostate cancer Livestock Carburetor K__ppen climate classification Dam Air pollution Survival skills Sea level rise Vegetation Ionizing radiation Bonsai Biodiversity Sewage treatment Hypoglycemia Glycogen storage disease type I Loudspeaker Thermal power station Desert Ice core Climate change Severe weather terminology (United States) Seismic retrofit Mosquito Biology Geography of Bolivia Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Marine aquarium Gout Vegetarianism Nutrition Coral reef Geography of Mexico Geography of Brazil Jute Guinea pig Genetically modified food Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests The Day After Tomorrow Equine conformation Legionellosis Nuclear power Environmental concerns with electricity generation Hard disk Atkins Nutritional Approach Meteorology Stoma Lake Terraforming Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Global warming Mattress Cancer Capercaillie Pachypodium habitats Atlanta metropolitan area

where can you bring a turtle that you can't take care of anymore i have a red eared slider and he's getting kinda big is there anywhere i can bring him if you bought your red eared slider in a pet store in your state then it is not a native species and you cannot release it into the wild without it dying even in states where you have an indigenous animal as a pet releasing it into the wild falls under the category of abandonment and is illegal almost everywhere call your local pet stores to see if they will take the turtle and adopt it out or sell it to someone else don't expect them to give you any money for the turtle if a pet store won't take it ask if they know of a reputable reptile rescue near you call the rescue facility and see if they have room for another red eared slider unfortunately this happens too often please research fully your next pet so that you know exactly how large they will get so that you can be prepared to take care of your pet for their entire lifetime  Turtle Pet Domestic rabbit Pet store Guinea pig Reptile Discus (fish) Hamster Microchip implant (animal) Pet skunk Dog Veterinarian Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Feral cat Cheetah Exotic pet Civilization III Tuatara Endangered species Fancy rat Leatherback Sea Turtle MapleStory American Alligator Sea turtle Gal__pagos Islands Counter-Strike Introduced species Phantom cat Dinosaur Animal Crossing Gaia Online Sears Holdings Corporation Maize The Beach Boys Mammal Fauna of Australia Elephant Neopets Common bean Shaggy dog story Tetrapod Community emergency response team Sin City Tasmanian Devil Sliders Taboo food and drink Galactic Civilizations Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Rabbit Finding Nemo Monkey Rat Cat Domestication Hedgehog Predation Pok__mon (video games) Villains in Power Rangers: Wild Force Minor Harry Potter Beasts American Red Cross Pet Sounds Ferret Pop Art: Pet Shop Boys - The Hits Meriones unguiculatus Livestock 1986 National League Championship Series Parachute Crocodile Poaching Domestic goat Snake charming Goat Flash (comics) Pok__mon Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Hurricane Katrina disaster relief Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (comic book) The Joker's Wild Tarantula Ross Perot Athrun Zala St. Louis Cardinals Puma Aladdin (1992 film) Labrador Retriever Game show Hard disk Dusty Springfield Rescue group Working dog Chicken Martin Scorsese Puppy mill Commodore International Logo programming language Zoo Tooth Animal shelter Brian Wilson Harry Connick, Jr.

ball python shedding problemo i work in a pet store and am relatively well traversed in reptile care nonetheless my ball python who is approx feet long is having some shedding problems i dont have a humidity monitor in my cage i have a heating mat under the cage hide box above it and a lamp on the opposite end a bowl full of water and some wood shrubbery purchased from my store my girl's eyes turned blue probably about days ago dissipated about a day and a half ago she's having an incomplete shed so i proceded to soak her for a half hour in luke warm water and now only the bottom half of her is shedding i am going to monitor the humidity starting tomorrow when i go to work and buy the necessary monitor i have a spray bottle of which i have sprayed the substrate with and i monitor the temp so i assumed the humidity was ok i am really worried about her bc i love my snake and i want her to be as healthy as possible what did i do wrong that resulted in an incomplete shed what needs to be done when a snake has problems shedding it is almost always a humidity problem ball pythons need at least humidity that can be hard to maintain in some areas so you'll definitely want to get a humidity monitor also there is a problem with the heating sources you have in the cage you say that you have an undertank heat mat on one side of the cage and a heat lamp on the other that means that you aren't providing a proper temperature gradient for your ball python one side of the cage needs to be cool and the other should be warm you don't want both sides of the cage to be warm unless you have your snake in a gallon aquarium remove the undertank heater if you can't keep a basking spot in the warm area at degrees then put the undertank heater on the same side as the heat lamp most likely the shedding problem is due to the humidity being too low but the heat sources could be contributing to the problem you may need to help your snake shed this time if the eyecaps don't come off on their own and you've never manually shed eye caps get a reptile vet or a reptile rescue worker to show you how  Thermal power station Reptile Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Dairy Refrigerator Aquarium Sun Solar power Hamster Autonomous building Cannabis cultivation Thermoregulation HVAC Marine aquarium Sauna Mercury Atlas 6 Diesel engine Houseplant Mattress Vacuum tube Shaggy dog story Nuclear power Guinea pig Water Diseases of the honeybee Textile manufacturing Dialysis Chicken Cold fusion Global climate model Solar variation Hyperthermia Coffee Incandescent light bulb Dog Air conditioning RuneScape quests Thermostat Carbon dioxide Caving Rail terminology Aerial (dance move) Las Vegas metropolitan area Milk Dundas Square Printed circuit board Hypothermia Avalanche Torpedo Brewery Surveillance Ozone depletion Renewable energy Bearded Dragon Drill bit Climate of the United Kingdom Fossil fuel power plant Heat Fire extinguisher Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Hydroponics Hiking Warm-blooded STS-62 Mars Exploration Rover Effects of global warming Japanese tea ceremony Salt Lake City, Utah Ozone hole Pet skunk The Day After Tomorrow Plasma (physics) Crocodilia Bicycle lighting Burmese python Seismic retrofit Energy development Escape from New York Temperature Plastic Hydrogen economy Wind Common cold Dallas, Texas Wind power Garter snake

is it safe to put a uvb lamp on top of a screen cover i have a turtle res and i was wondering if it is safe to put a uvb lamp on top of a screen top shouldn't be a problem at all in fact the uvb is quite necessary for the health of the turtle it provides vitamin d which is absorbed through the skin and helps to metabolize calcium as one of the other replies stated make sure that there is no other material between the light and the screen though much of the effectiveness is taken away if there is a clear plastic cover that the light must travel through on its way into the habitat and make sure to get a good bulb  Ultraviolet Vitamin D Nutrition Sunscreen Headlight Eczema Light-emitting diode Incandescent light bulb Sunburn Milk Stage lighting Ozone depletion Light Ozone hole Tocopherol Smoke-screen Chernobyl accident Cancer Anorexia nervosa Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Light pollution Vitamin Melanin Vacuum tube Bicycle lighting Hamster Common bean Cannabis cultivation Railway signalling Bearded Dragon Acne Lighting Cathode ray tube Reptile Traffic light Glass Dead Sea Water purification Solar cell Compact fluorescent lamp Calcium Garlic Railway signal Dundas Square Arc lamp Omega-3 fatty acid Rickets Color Herpes simplex virus Alzheimer's disease Automotive lighting Protein Effects of global warming Laser Leatherback Sea Turtle Tuatara Calcium metabolism Folic acid Fluoroscopy Kerosene lamp Prostate cancer M16 (rifle) Space habitat Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Sewage treatment Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Coeliac disease Bicycle helmet Beryllium Sea turtle Guinea pig IMAX Tofu Colonization of the Moon Diving suit Veganism Bong Photometry (optics) Stomach cancer Tyrannosaurus rex Hydroponics Physical attractiveness Polychlorinated biphenyl Human skin color Tank Malaria Mercury-vapor lamp Scientology beliefs and practices Carnivorous plant Potato Insulin Neon lamp Plastic Sun tanning Grape seed oil Carbon dioxide Light switch Pharmacology

baby ball python shedding i'm new to the shedding process so anything you can tell me would be helpful can i still hold him if he's shedding will he get agressive if i don't hold him for awhile the first stage of the shedding process is the snake's belly will turn a pinkish color and their eyes will begin turning cloudy milky usually the eyes will clear up right before the shed begins the snake's skin will turn dull or pale in most cases like a bluish color the shedding process usually takes anywhere between days sometimes longer if the humidity level is not right or if the snake is ill it is best not to handle the snake until the shedding is complete most snakes become irritated or agile while shedding and may strike or bite not always for meanness but sometimes because it really can't see you and may mistake your hand for prey also while in the shedding process the snake may refuse to eat so don't be too concerned about him missing a meal but do keep in mind that soon after the shedding is complete he should start back with his regular eating habits be sure to have something in the snake's tank that he can rub against to help with his shedding such as a rock not heated branches etc and a large enough water dish that the snake can soak in since he will spend most of his time soaking during shedding and the humidity level in the tank should be increased not too much also astro turf for the substrate is not only great for easy cleaning but it also helps with the shedding hope this helps and good luck with your ball python also just for your information in regards to the st comment i agree with all that was said but just wanted you to know why the skin on the tail if not shedded during the process should be removed because it will cause loss of circulation to the tail as well as the eye caps they should be removed because if left on can cause loss of circulation in the eyes and can cause permanent blindness  Snake Textile manufacturing Cat Chicken Dairy Knife First aid Brewery Moult Fecal incontinence Social rule Hyperthermia Leopard Hera Nutrition Carbon dioxide The Contender (television series) Acne Manicure Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eye Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Spider Ouroboros Drill bit Prostate cancer Piccolo Junior Saga Dog agility Drowning Sake Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake Escape from New York Garter snake Escherichia coli O157:H7 Fancy rat Infantilism Aerial (dance move) Xenomorph Tattoo American Alligator Bacon The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Garfield Shark Minor Harry Potter Beasts Psoriasis Volleyball Acorn Poker jargon Alexander Technique Thermal power station Japanese tea ceremony Son Goku (Dragon Ball) 1957 World Series Pok__mon Abilities Jon Secada Happy Tree Friends Tooth Sewage treatment Leaf Diving Characters in the Smurfs Kosher foods Thermoregulation Common cold Traffic light Croquet Insulin Tag Peter Shilton Mattress Craps Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater Snake charming Professional wrestling slang Burmese python Color Sun Pysanka Vampire Shaggy dog story Crocodilia Polychrotidae American lobster Cleveland Browns Ravenloft domains Tanning Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Space Shuttle program Cheetah

why did it die while molting i was caring for a hermit crab and i noticed it was molting i left it alone but when i went to change its water and food i notice it was beginning to smell a bit fishy finally after days of not standing the smell i pulled the molting shell and saw the hermit crab blackened and beginning to yeast up i can not find out why it died the way it did i'm gonna copy and paste this website i found it could be the reason i'll paste the website to for you so you can look up additional info hope this helps my learning curve for years i owned jumbo hermit crabs as pets sadly they would always die after about a year that was until the professor taught me that hermit crabs need to bury underground to survive the stress of molting often i am asked why i am drawn to hermit crabs as a pet my interest began years ago when i was in th grade and saw these fascinating and unusual creatures in a new pet shop the hermit crabs they had were of the species coenobita clypeatus commonly referred to as the purple pincher crab and they were the size of a baseball i was instantly hooked the pet shop owner was very patient and taught me how to properly handle the crabs and showed me that there wasn t any reason to be afraid of them i came home with my first pet jumbo hermit crab that i named lias since then my interest has become an obsession it s amazing to me when i think back to the early days and realize the impact this creature has had on my life for years i had jumbo crabs usually one at a time as pets at around the year mark they would always die i would be devastated and often swear off having another crab for fear of the same end result finally i would give into temptation since i loved these creatures so much each time i would try something different thinking that it was something that i was doing incorrectly the frustrating part was that i was following instructions outlined in the few hermit crab books on the market at that time during that time i was keeping my jumbo crabs on an inch or so of fish gravel in a gallon aquarium i was providing hermit crab food and a bowl of fresh water but unfortunately my jumbos would die when it was time to molt i switched to a few inches of beach sand in my cage when i moved to florida but still lost my crabs after about a year then one day something amazing happened my husband and i were sitting outside and i had my jumbo crab the professor out and was watching him roam the backyard he started digging we didn t know what he was doing so we watched eventually he completely buried himself at this point we were not quite sure what to do i brought a plastic laundry basket out to where he was buried turned it upside down over where he went down and put a cement block on top in case he tunneled back up throughout the following days i would frequently check the area where he buried to see if he had re surfaced finally after almost months of waiting i found him digging back up from his cave i picked him up and he had needle sharp nails lots of shaggy blonde sensory hair setae and his exoskeleton was shiny and new looking he had molted i was so excited i finally had a hermit crab that molted and he buried below ground to do it i decided to visit the university of miami s research library on key biscayne to see what i could find out about molting in crustaceans i learned about the dual hormones involved in the molting process and how environmental factors contribute to and determine which hormone is secreted ecdysone mh the molting hormone is secreted from the y organs located in the anterior part of the thorax mih the molt inhibiting hormone is produced in the eyestalks conditions such as darkness solitude warmth and moisture contribute to the secretion of the mh whereas unfavorable conditions such as light other crabs nearby excessive cold or heat and dryness cause the mih to be secreted in the hope that conditions will become favorable to molt this was a light bulb moment for me when a crab is able to bury underground into a protected isolated insulated environment of total darkness the molting hormone mh will be secreted and molting will commence likewise crabs that are unable to bury will experience unfavorable conditions and will secrete the mih to delay molting until conditions became favorable to bury but what happens if conditions remain unfavorable for too long my theory is that secretion of the mih is a short term means of protection if poor conditions persist the mih builds within the hermit crabs body to a toxic level and the crab reaches a point of no return the crab will not survive the molting process even if conditions finally become favorable this happens frequently to crabs kept on fish gravel in crowded conditions such as often seen in many pet shops mall kiosks and surf shops i believe that their ability to delay molting varies according to the size of the crab a jumbo can go much longer without molting than a smaller crab eventually some crabs will try to molt regardless of the conditions as with any animal the young crabs are more resilient and can often survive a surface molt i have never had a jumbo crab survive a molt attempt above ground usually they are not able to fully shed their old exoskeleton it was years ago the professor burried in the back yard i changed the way i set up my cages and i still have several of my pet crabs from that year  Puberty Antarctic krill Prostate cancer New York Giants RuneScape quests Shaggy dog story American lobster Arthropod Urinary

feeding firebelly toads i've recently purchased a pair of firebelly toads and it occured to me that i'd researched what to feed them and when but not how many i've been all over the internet trying to find out how many crickets to feed them in a week all the websites say a dozen to two dozen all at once i dumped a dozen crickets in there before heading to work and when i came back they're all gone and i have two extremely fat toads who are now waddling about their home searching for more i don't want to overfeed them so if i ration the crickets out how many should i feed them per week or per day o o i tend to put small crickets per toad per week and it tends to work out i have to occasionally seperate one or the other just to ease my mind when i see one that looks skinnier than the rest  Test cricket RuneScape quests Frog Breastfeeding Bob and George Obesity West Indian cricket team First-class cricket Sydney Riot of 1879 John McDouall Stuart Newcastle United F.C.

are corn snakes and corn milk snakes aggressive and where do each of them live no they are actually pretty timid shy creatures my niece has a male corn snake as a pet he is a beautiful snake with a lovely pattern of gold and orange and rust scales she feeds him thawed frozen mice it's not recommended to feed them live mice as the live ones may bite and scratch and hurt the snake she started him out on pinkies baby mice when he was young but now that he is fully grown he can eat small adults when she first got him he had a tank with some pebbles in the bottom and a log to hide in and she kept peering in to look at him even when he was hiding in the log he got annoyed with always being spied on so he piled pebbles up in front of the opening of the log so that she couldn't look in and see him anymore after that she learned to leave him alone more often she handles him frequently along with her two small sons and they don't ever get bitten unless they startle him he does get cranky when he's shedding though she's learned that it's best just to let him be at that time and not let the boys handle him i believe they are native to the prairies thus the gold and rust colored scales and are called corn snakes because they are often found hiding in corn fields planted in those areas  Snake Shaggy dog story Snake charming Hamster RuneScape quests Maize Tarantula Dog Chicken Elephant Garter snake Fancy rat Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Pet skunk House Mouse Ron and Fez Characters of Naruto FoxTrot Socialization Shen Gong Wu Goanna The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Domestic rabbit Breastfeeding Kangaroo The Adventures of Pete & Pete Comanche W.I.T.C.H.

experts on horsefield tortoises wanted i have a torty that will almost be i have had alot of different advice about hibernating how do i do it is he old enough how can i tell if he is strong enough how long do i hibernate him for is the best place really in a box in the fridge any help gratefully received unfortunately a great deal of information presented to tortoise keepers in the past has been inaccurate and sometimes positively lethal into this category falls such advice as never disturb a hibernating tortoise make sure you leave plenty of air holes in the hibernating box give your tortoise one last meal to see it through hibernation and provide plenty of cat or dog food in the diet the first is simply incorrect the last three can kill so as for your horsefield russian tortoise this species originates in central asia principally in pakistan and afghanistan it is of a generally light golden hue with black markings reaches a maximum of about mm and combines the miniature spurs with pointed tail similar to t hermanni it has a 'stubby' squarish body a long neck and most distinctively only four toes per foot hibernation is recommended but extra special care should be exercised as this tortoise is particularly prone to respiratory and skin complaints it requires a very low humidity environment and must never be subjected to damp large numbers have been collected in recent years and wild caught animals are common in the pet trade most do not survive for long you can certainly improve your tortoise's chances greatly simply by limiting the period of hibernation to not more than weeks at the outside this it should be stressed is for a perfectly fit specimen which is fully up to weight tortoises which are anything less than l fit or are in any way underweight will require a proportionally shorter period of hibernation under carefully controlled conditions possibly they may even need to be kept awake and feeding over the entire winter season if i knew more i would help more but i sincerly hope this helps  Hamster Cat Dog Domestic rabbit Obesity Sleep Fancy rat Minor Harry Potter Beasts Brown Bear Weight training Equine conformation Childbirth Zeno's paradoxes Domestication Hedgehog Guinea pig Gray Wolf Ferret Poker jargon Swimming Carnivorous plant Professional wrestling holds Urinary incontinence Internal ballistics Diabetes mellitus Wood Stroke Medicine Breastfeeding Menstrual cup Charles Darwin Anorexia nervosa Gal__pagos Islands Livestock Cheetah Pet skunk Tarantula Caving Pet Handloading Tyrannosaurus rex Psoriasis Elephant Extinction Tire Species Chicken Violin Kakapo American Black Bear Shrimp farm Trapping Jumpstart 3rd Grade Scientology beliefs and practices Expert system Tasmanian Devil Doomsday argument Inception of Darwin's theory Strap-on dildo Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Chlorpromazine Seismic retrofit Terminal ballistics Welding Stomach cancer Winter Fauna of Australia Cephalic disorder Asthma Shark Tooth Coeliac disease Clinical depression Central Asia Capercaillie Giraffe Microchip implant (animal) Albatross Tropical cyclone Color Houseplant Platypus Mattress Animal testing English grammar Nile crocodile Drill bit Neopets Normal distribution Fecal incontinence Xenomorph Spider

how do snakes act when they are shedding i have a ball python and i have never seen it shed before how do they usually act i was told that their bellies will turn pink before they shed my snakes belly is pinkish and he is acting really weird someone suggested to be that he may be shedding last night he was fine and now today he is barely moving and is unresponsive but is still alive he actually seems like he's drunk with the way he is moving his head i can not find a vet that will take me for an emergency appointment yet or an animal hospital that specializes in snakes around here any advice until i can get to the vet their bellies do in fact turn pinkish in color before a shed also look at his eyes and if they are creamy colored or milky then this is a true sign of a shed snakes can get inactive due to shed meaning that they will usually stay in their hide boxes if you have one until the skin starts to peel it is a good idea to have something such as a rock not a heated rock that the snake can rub against to help the shedding process it is a good idea not to try and hold the snake until after the shedding process is complete due to the fact that the snake may strike you the shedding process usually takes about days make sure that there is appropriate humidity in the tank and plenty of fresh water in his soaking drinking dish because he will spend most of his time soaking  Snake Dairy First aid Chicken Hyperthermia Leather Meriones unguiculatus Big Boss Reptile Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Garfield Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Ninja Scroll Tanning Animal communication Tofu Cantonese cuisine Thermoregulation Bacon The Dalek Invasion of Earth Fugu Textile manufacturing The Shining (film) Cat Astronomy on Mars Sin City Cocoa Tuatara Leaf Snake charming President of Ireland Cobra Commander Apple Happy Tree Friends Human skin color Poker jargon Social rule Thermal power station Crocodilia Escape from New York Wool Pet skunk Opportunity rover Creationism Pok__mon Abilities Potato Molotov cocktail The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Solid Snake Chocolate Solar power Herpes simplex virus Clown Plame affair Drowning Metal Gear The Legend of Zelda series enemies Common bean Richard Chase Sake Cigar Tattoo Sea serpent Kaa Rum Pysanka Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Alcoholics Anonymous Garter snake The Parting of the Ways Aerial (dance move) The Contender (television series) Hiking Infant baptism Bong Chinese White Dolphin Moult Pottery Conan the Barbarian Kosher foods Tai shogi RuneScape quests Jute Housebreaking Anaconda The Subtle Knife The Star Wars Holiday Special General relativity Drill bit New York Giants European dragon Pitaten Extraterrestrial skies Fancy rat Water (molecule)

red tailed boa i'm going to get a boa in september it's going to be a baby red tailed boa should i give it pinkies or when it gets bigger rats what should i give it how often and when when should i change how much of what it eats thanks for all of the help it sounds like this is your first snake i would suggest purchasing a book on red tail boa's for just that sort of info and make sure you have a reputible rodent supply the breeder should have some good answers for this too i have not had a red tail boa but from my experience you will start with pinkies but only for a few weeks snakes grow quickly fuzzies are also brief all of which you can easily feed live and i would recomend doing so offer food once a week if the snake is eagerly eating one within minutes every week or eating two then go up to the next size but use caution snakes are opportunistic feeders and will overeat you usually want to give the snake as big a mouse as it will eat at a year it will probably be on full grown mice then on to small rats eventually adult rats will be needed about once a month depending on size of rats and activity level  Hamster Fancy rat Shen Gong Wu Rat Cat House Mouse Brown Rat Guinea pig Breastfeeding Snake BoA The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents Capercaillie Mouse Kitten Squirrel Chicken Chinese New Year Fauna of Australia Kangaroo Laotian Rock Rat Hedgehog Red Fox Dieting Pet store My Little Pony Hall & Oates Franz Boas Gray Wolf Boa The Secret of NIMH Rodent Extreme Programming Creatures in Bionicle Domestic rabbit Super Size Me The Little Prince American Alligator Bamboo rat Long-term potentiation Britney Spears Porcupine Dog Flea Pit viper Biological pest control Eastern Gray Squirrel Anthropology $ale of the Century Garter snake Folic acid Tooth Aspartame Animal Discus (fish) Elephant Tocopherol Pinky and the Brain Pesticide Taboo food and drink Nile crocodile Kangaroo rat Cultural relativism Mario Gypsy moth Ball python American lobster Meaning of life Stomach cancer Virginia Military Institute Shaggy dog story Goanna Atkins Nutritional Approach Alcohol fuel Margaret Mead Metaphysics Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Heinkel He 100 Genetically modified food Baldrick Pet skunk Opportunity rover Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stem cell RuneScape quests Hypoglycemia Conker's Bad Fur Day Colorectal cancer Moult Stoat Narnia Burrowing Owl Murinae Meat Fasting Beaver Dragon boat Ferret Tasmanian Devil

anorexic leopard gecko is there something i haven't thought of she's been like this for months and months i made a total change in husbandry she has spent the summer on the balcony sun and cool shade available earlier on i was syringe feeding her more recently i've been putting globs of baby food on her nose for her to lick off her favourite food has always been waxworms i put some in a transparent dish for her every few days but she never eats i don't know what to do anymore what can i do to give her an appetite substrate impaction not possible she's kept on indoor outdoor carpet she has various hides in the cage all at varying temps i stopped the syringe feeding a couple of months ago when i got the idea to glob babyfood on the end of her nose i am aware that both techniques are stressful but it must be done she absolutely refuses to eat i forgot to add i give her live food she is years old and has always been fat and healthy i think there are a couple possibilities gut impaction caused by the leo eating substrate intestinal parasites some other disease bacterial infection i have reptiles too and i can see your concern you should take her to the vet to get an inspection if it's parasites ask about panacur it's for pigeons but it should work as a dewormer in correct dosage but first order of business would be to make an appointment with a vet and maybe do some research on different appetite stimulants hope your gecko feels better l ld  Nutrition Anorexia nervosa Fancy rat Myxobolus cerebralis Breastfeeding Domestic rabbit Insulin Stomach cancer Guinea pig Diseases of the honeybee Malaria Pet skunk Livestock Crohn's disease Gecko Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Obesity Diarrhea Food Glucocorticoid Vitamin C Chicken Allergy Shark Horse colic Foodborne illness Brain Cat Vegetarianism Common cold Swimming Chocolate Gastroparesis Tasmanian Devil Garfield Global warming Dog Veganism Coeliac disease Chronic fatigue syndrome Carnivorous plant Sewage treatment Dieting Toxoplasmosis Earthworm Bacteria Cirrhosis Folic acid Chagas disease Domesticated turkey Organic farming Oral sex Cannabis (drug) Hamster Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Dairy Egg (food) Hamburger Asthma Gypsy moth Genetically modified food Tsetse fly DDT Bread Milk Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Weekly World News Omega-3 fatty acid Eye Vampire Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Ulcerative colitis Glucokinase Chlorophyta Clinical depression Animal testing Ferret Spanish flu Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Coprophagia Ascariasis Apple Beetle Equine conformation Discus (fish) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Low-carbohydrate diet Koala Tocopherol Ecology AIDS Daylight saving time

help i found a baby turtle what do i do its a regular pet turtle that someone dumped at my park its not a box or snapping turtle its the kind that you buy at the pet store what should i do nobody will take him because its not a wild turtle and pet stores say that they only sell the ones that get shiped to them hes a little bigger than a quarter help is very skinney how long do they live for to i want to keep it as cheap as possible ok here's a list of things you will need gallon tank or bigger the turtle will grow so eventually you will need a bigger tank you may want to go with a gallon right away uva and uvb lights so he can bask this will prevent his shell from deforming blue rocks for the bottom of the tank a rock for him to climb up on to get dry you can also get a plastic floating thing that attaches to the wall of the tank with suction cups reptomin basic turtle food you can also buy alternate foods like shrimps blood worms etc just ask the people at the pet store a filter for the tank which should be included if you buy the kit a thermometer and a heater also included with kit the water should be about degrees f you should fill the tank a little more than halfway with water turtles are somewhat dirty they poop alot so you may need to clean the tank kind of often every few weeks you do this by siphoning out the water into a bucket making sure to scrape the gravel to get all the dirt from the gravel at the bottom then you just pour out the dirty water and pour fresh tap water in the tank congratulations a turtle is a great friend to have and will live many years if you take good care of it  Hamster Discus (fish) Coffee Dredge Cruising (maritime) Axolotl Fancy rat Plastic Flush toilet Snapping turtle Bong Dairy Textile manufacturing Autonomous building Solar power Anchor Milk Dry cleaning Toilet humour Fish farming E85 Aquarium Shrimp farm Reef tank Psoriasis Thermal power station GunBound Leatherback Sea Turtle Brewery Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Siphon Wine making Turtle Common bean Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Glossary of nautical terms Cannabis cultivation Mattress Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Goldfish Polyethylene terephthalate Urinal Casting Biodiesel Maple syrup Dishwasher Fossil fuel power plant Vacuum cleaner Rail terminology Emergency preparedness Concrete American lobster Vermicompost Menstrual cup The dozens Samovar Neopets Guinea pig Hard disk Hydrogen economy Japanese tea ceremony Dead Sea Houseplant EastEnders Naval mine Apollo 13 Bikini Bottom Glossary of wildland fire terms Refrigerator Angling Fire fighting Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time Ecco the Dolphin Reptile Tooth Care Bears Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Sears Holdings Corporation Hydroponics GunZ The Duel Swimming pool Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Tilapia Sin City Enceladus (moon) Kosher foods Piccolo Junior Saga Hazing Koopa Troopa Fishing Shark Fire extinguisher

im getting a bbaby bearded dragon if i use the uvb light and a heating pad tomaintainthe temp would it survive well it depends on the size of your cage and the wattage of the bulbs i've got a gallon aquarium with a watt light bulb and a heat mat and the temp in the room the aquarium is in stays around degrees the previous person who said that they can't feel heat on their belly's and there is an increased risk of burns is right however as long as you use cage carpet and the correct size heat mat you should be okay but if you are planning on using some type of substrate that they can move out of the way and lay directly on the glass over the heat mat there is a definite possibility for burns even though they cannot feel the heat on there belly's doesn't mean that the heat isn't penetrating through there skin and helping warm up there internal temps or the air around them my beardies love their mats and have not had any burn issues that being said you say uvb light are you talking about the kind that is shaped just like a regular light bulb even though these say on the package that they put off enough uvb light for reptiles they do not the only way to get enough uvb light is to use the tube shaped lights the repti sun is supposed to be pretty good i felt i had to add this because i've had my beardies for a couple of years now and thought like most people the other bulbs were what they needed and just found out a few months ago that is not the case beardies are at a higher risk of metabolic bone disease than other reptiles so their uvb requirements are a lot higher if you use the reptisun i don't believe it puts out much heat so you would still need a watt light bulb for heat but since you are providing your uvb requirements with the reptisun you can use a regular watt incandescent bulb and save some they are the same exact thing the pet store is selling you for a bulb any way and this way you get them for a but like i said you still have to have your uvb light as well the regular light bulbs are just for heat i've also heard that the little sticky thermometers don't measure the heat accurately so a digital thermometer is your best bet and for a baby the basking site is supposed to be degrees but if you are using a stick on don't try to get it this high cause your thermometer can be off by as much as degrees i feel the need to tell you all this cause these are the mistakes i made with my beardies and i spent so much money on the wrong stuff i was irate but since you're just starting out you can get the right stuff from the beginning and save yourself the hassle here's a good beardie group http pets groups yahoo com group pogona i have learned so much in there since i joined it's all beardie owners and breeders so they really know what they are talking about and give great advice it's better to know and have everything before you get the beardie that way you're not kicking yourself for getting the wrong stuff later like me also right now a gallon is ok since it's a baby but as an adult it's going to need at least a gallon aquarium mine is in an aquarium entirely too small and i'm working on getting that fixed too they make great pets though after you get the set up part of it all done good luck and have fun with your baby  Fluorescent lamp Incandescent light bulb Light-emitting diode Psoriasis Ultraviolet Temperature Solar power Lighting Milk Strap-on dildo Aerial (dance move) Aquarium Vitamin D Theory of conduct Thermoregulation EastEnders Sunscreen Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bicycle lighting Compact fluorescent lamp Bearded Dragon Neighbours Sunburn Poker jargon Diode Equine conformation Explosive material Prostate cancer Ozone depletion Transformer Solar cell Houseplant Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Circuit design Microeconomics Eye Friends Headlight Ozone hole Stage lighting Nuclear power Breastfeeding Internal ballistics E85 Marine aquarium Supply and demand Brewery Eczema Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Professional wrestling holds Reef tank Floppy disk Domestic rabbit Betting (poker) Hand grenade Textile manufacturing Daylight saving time Hamster Care Bears Sento RuneScape skills Tank Handloading Mercury (element) Electrodeless lamp Carbon dioxide Charles Goodyear Characters in the Smurfs Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Phoebe Halliwell Mixed martial arts Paragliding Futurama (TV series - season 5) Craps Dog Extreme Programming Bayesian inference Thermal power station Hypoglycemia Nuclear reactor Sun Welding Escherichia coli O157:H7 Transistor Future energy development Violin Causality Tuatara Laser Leaf The Silence (The Twilight Zone) Swimming pool Laser engraving Hearing impairment

am having a big problem with my ball python hi ppl am having abig problem with my ball python its a ft long and a years old female my problem is it didn't eat for the past months now its drinkin water pretty good and sheading every months witchs great i clean my python every week end and the temp inside the tank is c i dont know wut to do where i live we dont have good vets so plz help me with a new way i asked avet once and he said i could feed him eggs by asereng so do u recomend it plz help me cuz i need to feed him asap though months is a long time to go without food it is not uncommon for wild pythons to go up to a year without she does need to eat you are right about that but don't panic there are numerous ways to feed a snake i'm not sure which method you use but maybe one of these will provide you with some help you can feed multiple pinky mice or rats live is fine because they won't do any harm to the snake you can feed live rats or mice but you run the chance of cosmetic damage to the snake you can feed thawed frozen mice or rats you can thaw a frozen mouse or rat and soak it in some chicken broth to make it smell more tasty you an also try feeding the snake a gerbil live or dead is fine gerbils are actually what they live on in the wild always move the snake to a different enclosure to eat i used a large plastic tub i would put the snake in the tub and then drop a mouse into the tub and sit back if after an hour or so of still quiet undisturbed time with the prey the snake does not eat you may need to force feed her force feeding is hard on snakes and it is only used as an absolutely last resort by the time you make that decision you should have already spoken with a vet or a knowledgeable herpetologist and come to the conclusion that this is the only way to go if you've never had to force feed a snake before i would suggest asking your vet or herpetologist to do it for you  Fancy rat Chicken Hamster Textile manufacturing Tofu Cat Seabird Albatross House Mouse Kosher foods Ball python Gypsy moth The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Mouse (computing) Breastfeeding Dairy Stem cell Shaggy dog story Spider The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Have I Got News For You Diseases of the honeybee Ice cream Garfield Dishwasher Sea-Monkey FoxTrot Trapping Ron and Fez Shark Kangaroo Electrophysiology Frog Rat Poker jargon Burmese python Japanese cuisine The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Cannibalism Tasmanian Devil Naruto jutsu Monty Python and the Holy Grail Meriones unguiculatus Creatures in Bionicle Domestic rabbit Monty Python Animal communication Cryonics Beetle Minor Harry Potter Beasts Hamburger Piccolo Junior Saga Ferret Baldrick Kodocha Vegetarianism Biological pest control Universal Serial Bus Reptile Taboo food and drink Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Chinese New Year Stomach cancer Toilet humour Animal testing Arianne Treehouse of Horror V Egg (food) Aladdin (1992 film) Nocturnal animal Tai shogi Livestock Gerbil Snake charming Ramen Chinese cuisine Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Kenny McCormick Goanna Fire fighting Social rule Rice Bread Goldfish Raw food diet American Black Bear Garter snake Jackass: The Movie Turmeric

what is better bedding for iguanas sand or mulch i've been buying this mulch or bark stuff as bedding for my iguana cage but i was wondering if buying sand would be better with the sand i thought it might keep him warmer and be softer but the bark might soak up his mess better any suggestions don't use anything that the iguana can accidentally ingest we use white towels and or newspaper for all of our iguanas if the iguana accidentally ingest something he can get impacted which can cause death please reconsider your substrate choice  Sewage treatment Chinchilla FoxTrot Hamster Shit Honey fungus Mulch SpongeBob SquarePants The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Gypsy moth Towel Iguana Stratification (botany) Opportunity rover Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Black pepper The Voyage of the Beagle LSD Pachypodium habitats Traumatic brain injury Earthworm Tennessee Williams Mattress Dinosaur Paracetamol Plutonium Fallout (computer game) Selma's Choice Jayne Mansfield Cinnamon Dye Weed control Sand Iron Fist Aida (musical) Johnny Depp The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Academy Award for Costume Design Paul Is Dead Iron Toilet paper Origin of life Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Academy Award for Best Art Direction Eisner Award Paleoclimatology Sugar Camp Delta Wood pulp Shark Seabird Pansy Eucalyptus Mars Shaggy dog story Straw Rich Mullins Geology of the British Isles Kurt Cobain Don Rosa Leather Bladderwort Alcoy, Cebu Habitats of Pachypodium of Southern Continental Africa and Madagascar Dune Collecting fossils Russian joke Oak Albatross Canyonlands National Park Upholstery Gas mantle White Sands National Monument Pebble bed reactor Lightning Felis sapiens True Crime: Streets of LA Ripped Pants Daylight saving time Sudden Oak Death Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Sam Kinison Calvin and Hobbes Manicure Mixed martial arts Road traffic accident Advertising Inception of Darwin's theory Tuatara Brugmansia Blood on the Tracks Minor characters in Seinfeld Knots Landing Hydrogen peroxide Scarlet's Walk Fermi paradox Dead Like Me Hide (musician) 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake

i own a ball python and she's been very aggressive lately how do i handle her without being so nervous gloves are a good idea but you also might try using a hook to remove her from the cage before you handle her the cage is home and snakes are often more defensive when you reach in i use a hook with my corns and ball pythons and they usually calm right down the more relaxed you are the better as well  Hamster Boxing Python Burmese python Ball python Monty Python Baseball Softball Rugby union positions Batting (cricket) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Python programming language Pythonidae Snake charming Volleyball Babe Ruth Field hockey Professional wrestling match types Fast bowling Happy Tree Friends Snake Fancy rat Mixed martial arts Catcher Cricket Reptile Baseball statistics Laws of cricket John Cage Dai dai shogi Golf Tai shogi Broomball Reticulated Python Goalkeeper Ferret Trapping Hank Aaron Domestic rabbit Stolen base Leg before wicket Fielding (cricket) Anger Water polo Nicolas Cage Pitcher Joy Division (band) John Cleese 1957 World Series Weight training Universal joint Interference (baseball) Shaggy dog story First baseman 2004 World Series Ted DiBiase Andr__s Galarraga Shrek 2 Derek Jeter Robin Ventura Snooker Tied Test RuneScape locations Sigmund Freud Bouncer Cyberspace Fencing Insomnia Categorical list of programming languages Table tennis Weapons of Star Trek Club (weapon) Taikyoku shogi Reginald Maudling American football Psychoanalysis Ken Harrelson Monkey Table football Appeal play The Bad Beginning Rattlesnake Rugby league Pickling Blitzball Zone of the Enders: The Fist of Mars Shortstop Ice hockey RuneScape quests Metal Gear (video game) Dog training Steel Cage Match Nervous system Professional wrestling throws Lake Burley Griffin Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Musical Mike Schmidt Dismissal (cricket) New York Giants

how much space do red eared sliders res need i hav female res and hav no clue of how much space they need someone plz answer cause my turtles r currently cramped up in a tiny fish tank and theyd be happy if yu answer thanks if yu answer red eared sliders females get about the size of a dinner plate when full grown they are like many fish and reptiles they will only grow as big as their tank allows once you put them in a larger one they grow more we had a slider for years in a gallon and she finally passed from old age good filtration for a turtle really doesn't exist they have a lot of poo which they do eat and it is so much a filter really can't effectively work so a weekly cleaning is the best with a filter heating isn't really necessary either if you home is degrees that's just fine also they enjoy a little cooler temps in the winter to mimic their hibernation you will notice they are healthier and grow better when the cooler temps let them rest also in the cooler temps you will notice a drop in eating finally a reptile bulb that mimics sunlight is a must if you get the incandescent kind they will use that a a heat source and love sprawling out under it if it is a bulb system leave the bulb out of one side so they don't get too hot and put a resting place out of the water under the bulb  Brewery Temperature Aquarium Light-emitting diode Stage lighting Marine aquarium Incandescent light bulb Sewage treatment Air conditioning Fluorescent lamp Thermoregulation Leatherback Sea Turtle Sun Diode Autonomous building Reptile Solar power Carburetor Hamster Traffic light Hippeastrum Lighting Reef tank Tuatara Houseplant Vacuum tube Color temperature Tetrapod Dichroic filter Dishwasher Sliders Kitchen Biodiesel Yerba mate Dry cleaning Solar system Water purification Opportunity rover Gray Wolf Urban sprawl Beatmania IIDX Coffee Piccolo Junior Saga Shaggy dog story Sly Cooper Fossil fuel power plant Environmental concerns with electricity generation Humphrey Bogart Cannabis cultivation Rocko's Modern Life Urban heat island Glass Light Customs and etiquette of Japan Hydrogen economy Electrophysiology Billboard Hot 100 Sea-Monkey Bicycle lighting Agar plate Headlight Loudspeaker Warm-blooded Mercury Atlas 6 Sunlight Creatures in Bionicle Crookes radiometer Water Solar panel Dinosaur Mnemonic Home repair Swamp cooler Extraterrestrial skies Ultraviolet Photometry (optics) E85 Renewable energy Railway signal Stereoscopy Polarization Platypus Shit Kidney Dead Sea GunBound Dialysis Radio Yerevan Discus (fish) Theory of conduct Light pollution Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Vacuum Leaf Japanese tea ceremony Animal Jumpstart 3rd Grade American Black Bear

anole egg found hi everyone today i found what i think is an anole egg it was under the log i have put in their tank one of the male lizards was laying on it to keep it warm i called petco to see if i should take it out and they said yes so i did and it is under the light on a tupperware cover with mulch that is wet it is night time now and i am wondering if i should turn the light off for the night or lower the light and put the egg directly under the lamp and if you have any other advise on how to care for this egg and to keep it safe and alive i would greatly appreciate it also once it's hatched should i get another tank while it is still little thank you ps it looks like a hugh tic tac candy xs the size of a regular tic tac well stop and think the male laying on it isnt as hot as a lamp right u should keep the lamp on but put it at least inches away from the egg so that the egg doesnt get too hot and cook inches should keep it warm enough and i would definately get a small gallon aquarium or critter keeper box while it is a baby the bigger anoles will most likely eat the baby once it hatches if u put it in the same cage with them good luck  Clownfish Tic-Tac-Dough Chicken Egg (food) Carolina Anole Platypus American lobster Shark Solar power Sea-Monkey Lizard Kakapo Goldfish Campfire Leatherback Sea Turtle Incandescent light bulb Tuatara Tarantula Mattress Emu Fluorescent lamp Marine aquarium Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kerosene lamp Octopus Grunion Hamster Diseases of the honeybee Halfbeak Headlight Coconut crab Grumpy's Three Wishes Grasshopper Capercaillie Care Bears Happy Tree Friends Egg (biology) Salmon Breakfast USS Yorktown (CV-5) Mantis shrimp Pysanka Minor Harry Potter Beasts Cruising (maritime) Japanese cuisine Antarctic krill Railway signalling Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Traffic light Bicycle lighting Bird Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Thermal power station American Alligator Eggerland series Tilapia Irrigation Kitchen Zerg Reef tank Comanche Beetle Cliff Richard Autonomous building Ladybird Ocean's Twelve Lighting Mulch Breastfeeding Strap-on dildo Cantonese cuisine STS-114 Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Frog Boom Town (Doctor Who) Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Aurora (astronomy) Glossary of firefighting terms Cuisine of Denmark Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Nile crocodile Compact fluorescent lamp Automotive lighting Snake Brewery Russian joke Jewish cuisine Mercury Atlas 6 Killifish Battle of Jutland YuYu Hakusho Railway signal Rocko's Modern Life Earthworm Tank Mercury 4 Seismic retrofit Ron and Fez

does anyone know anyone that is looking for a new home for a tortoise i live in london and am looking to adopt a tortoise that is need of a new home can give a small donation would like a hermann or spur thigh if possible have everything ready tortoise table outdoor run etc if person will deliver will pay petrol money thanks i think that if you can own this kind of animal responsibly then you could approach the rspca or any animal centres as they often have exotic pets that have been abandoned by people who have paid for one and cant look after it or cant be bothered with the responsibility i think some of the answers you have had are not taking you seriously here and i dont know why but ignore them what i will say though is find out about bacteria these kind of animals can carry i used to have a red earred terrapin i gave him away because of the risk of the bacteria as i have a little boy who probably would have messed with it kids and aquatics dont go together and if we handled him we had to wash our hands as he carried bacteria which could make us ill so thats something to look into oh and lifespan is a biggie as some breeds can outlive people i do wish i'd kept mine though as he was beautiful but i found a good home for him and i didnt ask for money cos it was enough to know someone would love him like i did anyway good luck and i hope i've helped even though i havent got what you're looking for  Tortoise Singlish American Red Cross Foodborne illness Domestic rabbit Pitaten The Notorious B.I.G.

has anyone been bitten by their ball python i'll admit i haven't been a very good pet parent as of recently i'm a single parent of a crazy two year old who has recently taken lots of my time it's summer i haven't really had much contact with my snake other than feeding watering i haven't handled her in probably a month i'd like to get her out and spend some time with her this weekend but i'm a little nervous anyone else gone a few weeks without handling and then tried she's never struck before you just never know i've been bitten plenty of times there's nothing to worry about it doesn't matter too much if you haven't handled them for a while i think it depends more on their personality some are more easy going others are more timid and then you get those that have a lot of attitude a defensive strike really doesn't hurt that much i would much rather get bit by a ball than say a puppy or kitten that was playing around the only difference is the shock factor because they're so quick usually the defensive strikes will be over before you know you've been bit just move slow and approach the snake from the back instead reaching towards the head most of the time even a very agressive ball will mellow out as soon as you have him in your hands oh and make sure you weren't handling any rats or mice before reaching in i know that sounds obvious but many people forget and will end up with a feeding strike feeding strikes aren't that bad either but the snake will coil up and hold on for perhaps a few minutes you're not in danger of anything but it's a little more frightening if you're not expecting it just wait until the snake lets go or run the snake under cold water feeding strikes are really uncommon though  Fast bowling Volleyball Shaggy dog story Social rule Theory of conduct Dog training Snake Table tennis Snake charming Ron and Fez Softball 1957 World Series Breastfeeding I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Baseball Equine conformation Hamster Naval mine Textile manufacturing Haven (TNG episode) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Paintball Cricket Socialization Kender The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Rugby union positions Snooker EastEnders Tag Kim Possible Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Guinea pig New York Giants Garfield Dog Toilet humour Tai shogi Croquet Pet skunk Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Escape from New York Blood (computer game) Atomic Kitten RuneScape quests Nine Inch Nails Norway national football team Time Out of Mind Feral cat Pump It Up American football Water polo Hey Jude Kodocha Dualism (philosophy of mind) Swingout Ball python CPU cache Spider Worms weapons and tools M16 (rifle) Treehouse of Horror IX Eric Cartman Fancy rat Pinball Piccolo Junior Saga Ferret StarCraft Secret Missions Martial art Unreal Ron Weasley Poker jargon Futurama (TV series - season 5) Hypoglycemia GunZ The Duel Eight ball Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Rugby league positions StarCraft Episode VI Ravi Shastri Mouse (computing) Lightning Babe Ruth Goanna The Contender (television series) Professional wrestling slang Floppy disk Characters in the Smurfs Pete Sampras Aerial (dance move) Mach kernel American football strategy Fielding (cricket) Hermione Granger

what does a garden lizard eat is there any vegetarian feed for him yes most small native lizards are carnivores and will only feed on insects and not vegetables or plant material depending on the species and size of the lizard it may be difficult to obtain a reliable food source if it is a green anole as i suspect since they are quite common and easier to capture than say a skink or fence lizard he could live quite well off a diet of small crickets  Polychrotidae Lizard Vegetarianism Veganism Fauna of Australia Hamster Carnivorous plant Skink Vermicompost Carolina Anole Hedgehog Cat Plant Endangered species Tyrannosaurus rex Agriculture Biodiversity of New Zealand Botany American Alligator Capercaillie Salmon Goanna Livestock Reptile Insect Acorn Brown Bear Environmental vegetarianism Dieting Beetle Watermelon Gecko Snail Biological pest control Hunting Yosemite National Park Night lizard Maize Paleocene Chicken Phelsuma Ecology Egg (food) Organic farming Vegetarianism and religion Vegetarian nutrition Taboo food and drink Discus (fish) Tasmanian Devil Mosquito Gypsy moth Creatures in Bionicle Food Green Revolution Buddhist cuisine Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Tomato Squash (fruit) Meat Island Fox Kashrut Domestication Mantodea Great Basin Australian megafauna Tofu Soybean Manna Common bean Peruvian cuisine Trophic level Raw food diet Kosher foods Grasshopper Healthy eating Vegetarian cuisine Domestic rabbit Pitcher plant Dog Cochineal Onion Bearded Dragon Compost Japanese tea ceremony Food chain Eumeces Oceania ecozone Coconut crab Pine Animal Cheese Meal Iguana Bat Eating Lawn mower Giant Panda Cuisine of Brazil

does anyone know where to release pet turtles i want to release them to somewhere that they would be good the turtles sizes are bigger than my hand average size hand there are five of them if there are parks where you live let them go there split them up if possible it's better for them that's what happens when people sell baby red eared sliders buyers don't know what they're getting into i had two at one time and they were getting to be too much trouble to care for they got to be about or long before i let them go i enjoyed having them but changing the water and cleaning the tank was very inconvenient for me i bought all the equipment i needed to care for them though heaters light filters thermometers special foods etc that's better treatment than a lot of those poor turtles get next time i'm definitely going to look for a tortoise good night i just thought about it after reading the next answer but it is possible for turtles in captivity to transmit diseases to wild turtles typically it's a bad idea to let pets go they might become an invasive species but red eared sliders are all over the place so that's pretty unlikely if you can't find someone who will take them off your hands letting them go in a park is about the best option you have good luck gee three thumbs down the answer isn't that bad what was i supposed to tell her to do kill the turtles if she can't find someone who wants to take them because if you can't let them go in a place where they're native or find someone to take them off your hands then that's about all you can do anyway those ponds in parks are hardly natural ecosystems and they usually have red eared sliders anyway i'm making an assumption that those turtles are red eared sliders because that's the most common species for people to get stuck with involuntarily because of all those people selling their hatchlings for educational purposes  Reptile Social rule Discus (fish) Turtle Snapping turtle Theory of conduct Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Hamster Leatherback Sea Turtle Gal__pagos Islands Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Poker jargon Aquarium Sliders Violin Kylie Minogue Tetrapod Species Hard disk Fish farming Supply and demand Goldfish Ecology Neopets Cat Sea turtle Dog 2000 Australian Grand Prix Hedgehog Microeconomics Tuatara Sewage treatment Mid-levels Light pollution Domestic rabbit Bee Gees Island Fox Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Labrador Retriever Cruising (maritime) Cheetah Rocko's Modern Life Pet Knife EastEnders Nicomachean Ethics Escherichia coli O157:H7 Endangered species GunBound Brewery Beaches of Hong Kong Dairy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Marine aquarium Tiger Sin City Common cold About a Boy Futurama (TV series - season 5) Autonomous building Mosquito Mario Kart: Double Dash!!

i have a red eared slider and i would like to know if it is ok to use tap water in their tank should i use purified or tap water do not use distilled water or bottled water distilled water is probably unhealthy and bottled water is an unnecessary expense just get a bottle of chlorine remover and follow the instructions on the label to dechlorinate tap water you can get it at any pet store or maybe even walmart by the fish i've never heard of anyone using bottled water for that it's preposterous good luck oh yeah the best way i found to make sure the water is at the right temperature is to have a heater in the tank with the turtles when you change the water keep them in a little water make sure they can't jump out or drown then after the water is replaced let it sit with the heater and the filter pump on until the thermometer something else you should buy shows the right temperature range i forgot what temperature it should be but you can look that up online then put the turtles back and dump the rest of the water make sure you have a reptile light with a timer on the tank also because turtles need light to be healthy good luck  Marine aquarium Autonomous building Water purification Aquarium Sea-Monkey Brewery Refrigerator Fossil fuel power plant Water Sewage treatment Thermoregulation Acetic acid Coffee Single malt Scotch Hydrogen peroxide Scotch whisky Plastic Polyethylene terephthalate Beer Axolotl Leatherback Sea Turtle Reef tank Rum Reptile Thermostat Motor oil Hydrogen economy Mercury (element) Discus (fish) Titanium Bottled water Swimming pool Cruising (maritime) Water supply Thermal power station Wal-Mart B-47 Stratojet Fractional distillation Energy Bong Goldfish Dairy Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time Apollo 13 Alcoholic beverage Shaggy dog story Sake Fountain Neopets Polychlorinated biphenyl Ecco the Dolphin Bathing Platypus Gasoline Hyperthermia Brewing Incandescent light bulb HVAC Hydroponics Transformer Dialysis Temperature PID controller Guinness Energy development Diesel engine Cider Programmable logic controller Wine making Tetrapod Water heater Ammonia Water (molecule) American Alligator Logo programming language Siphon Tuatara Domestic water system Town gas GunBound Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Chlorine Irrigation Domestic rabbit Snapping turtle Fish farming Customs and etiquette of Japan Portable stove Yohoho!

turtle question i have a year old slider turtle and i want to get a baby turtle to go in the same cage do you think the bigger turtle will harm the little one if you get another turtle please quarantine it for a month before putting it in the other tank this is to prevent a any possible disease from getting to your two year old turtle how small of a turtle are you thinking of getting i had a three year old painted turtle and then put a one year old painted in with him and they were fine if you do decide to get this other turtle you will want to get one that is months to a year old in order to make sure that it's shell is hard enough to with stand being in with the other turtle a trick would be to clean the tank out before putting the turtles together then when the tank is ready put the smaller one in first and let it swim around for a while before putting the bigger one in this way the bigger turtle will think that it is in the smaller turtle's territory and they will therefore be nicer to each other watch them very carefully for about a week after you first put them together i have a year old and year old in a gallon tank and they get along great as another note watch the sexes of the turtles same sex turtles get along better they will occasionally fight for territory but this is normal and natural a good way to stop it though is to ground one to a small bucket and tell them that they are a very bad turtle turtles have personalities and they are all different setmefree male sliders grow up to a length of about inches and females grow up to about inches any questions please message me  Sento Hamster Fire fighting Turtle Futurama (TV series - season 5) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Textile manufacturing Violin Dodge Charger Beaches of Hong Kong American lobster Sea turtle Cruising (maritime) GunBound Discworld (world) Second Battle of El Alamein Polish September Campaign Marine aquarium Terran (StarCraft) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Quarantine The Turtles Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Coconut crab Vegeta Domestic rabbit Ecco the Dolphin Rocko's Modern Life Equine conformation Knife Urinary incontinence Amateur telescope making Terminal ballistics Puberty Remora Professional wrestling match types Laws of cricket Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters Condom Mojave people Operation Barbarossa Penis Super Mario Bros.

i have a year old ball python that i am trying to convert to frozen food i have been feeding him live mice for years with no troubles please don't scold me about this i know the dangers and never leave a live mouse unattended in my habitat but he is getting to big for just mice and the price for one is getting to be outrageous and i do not want to give him a live rat as there are bigger dangers than a little mouse i have no trouble pre killing a rat i just don't know what methods to use i have the patience to convert him i just really don't know how fear not o i rescued a three year old ball python that had only been given live food and i converted him to frozen there are many methods you can use so let me list a few that i tried note i just buy frozen mice from the petshop grins no i don't use frozen rats i've had pet rats and just can't find it in me to feed him rats my sister had mice i hated them no dilemma there i just give him two mice per feeding instead of one moving the dead prey back and forth in front of the snake's face with tongs not your hands kaa the python didn't like this at all as he was basically frightened of any kind of movement came from a really bad home put the mouse in one of the snake's favorite places to hide and leave it there overnight this didn't work either for kaa i came down in the morning to find he had shoved it across the cage into the opposite corner plus it smelled really bad by that point ugh that brings me to another freezing and thawing a rodent repeatedly so it gets old and has a sort of rotting smell some snake like there to be a strong scent to their food shrugs i tried this one and in my own opinion keep this as one of your last options face slightly green yeah try to cover up the freezer and dead smells some people rub the dead animal on a live rodent kinda disturbing for the live animals i know so it smells like a live rodent i also tried cutting the mouse open along the head braining but kaa freaked out and wouldn't touch it a breeder i spoke to numerous times who coached me through this when i was ready to give up said he'd heard of people dipping the mouse in something like chicken broth to cover the dead scent and give a more desirable smell mmm chicken flavored mouse my favorite xd now this is the one that worked for me it's especially popular with ball pythons due to their shy eating behaviors turns out kaa's just a really shy eater even though he'd always eaten live prey before weird snake pythons like closed in spaces in my own opinion try this one first get a brown paper grocery bag and put the thawed warm dead prey item in it place the bag in the snake's cage standing upright put the snake inside the bag with the prey item fold the top of the bag over so you can't see the snake and it can't see out close and latch the cage top and make sure nothing disturbs the snake when he's done eating he'll easily be able to escape the bag and go into his favorite hiding place don't try to peek in to see if he's done if he doesn't want to eat he'll climb out of the bag leaving the dead rodent in there important note pythons have very slow metabolisms i've met people whose pythons stopped eating for months to a year the owner shouldn't fret unless they note that their snake is losing weight then and only then is it a problem kaa's previous owners fed him a few days before i got him for the first two months i had him he refused to eat as he remained the bulky muscular physique ball pythons should have i didn't worry shuffles okay so i did but only a little only a tiny bit yeah okay screw it i was worried for someone who'd had rabbits rodents and dogs all her life having a pet refuse to eat for two months was just a bit unnerving if none of these tips work or if you have any questions feel free to email me i've got some more pointers but hopefully the paper bag one should work good luck  Shaggy dog story Snake Dog Domestic rabbit Trapping Dog training Mouse (computing) Escape from New York RuneScape quests Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Chicken Equine conformation Sin City Poker jargon W.I.T.C.H.

is it wrong to feed your turtle cooked fish like a whitefish cod or something soft like that it isn't wrong to feed them cooked fish at all depending on the type of turtle it is many if that turtle is supposed to have protein or not feeding raw may be a better solution since cooking it may take some of the nutritional value out of it though if you don't like feeding raw and prefer cooked then that's ok  Egg (food) Tofu Common bean Gelatin Veganism Peruvian cuisine Salmon Livestock Vegetarianism Fishing Fish and chips Cuisine of Malaysia Breastfeeding Raw food diet Healthy eating Vitamin C Tilapia Whaling Milk Sugar beet Shrimp farm Peanut RuneScape quests Protein Dairy product Acorn Cheese Maize Pizza Omega-3 fatty acid Nutrition Chicken Discus (fish) Lake Burley Griffin Ham Atlantic cod By-catch Egg white RuneScape skills Cuisine of Denmark Cuisine of Laos Breakfast Stock (food) Agriculture Rice Domestic rabbit Fish farming Sausage In-N-Out Burger Bengali cuisine Soup Protein-energy malnutrition Food Marine biology Gefilte fish Lutefisk Organic farming Flounder Soybean Korean cuisine Banana French cuisine Russian cuisine Ketchup Fish oil Fancy rat Honey Cuisine of the Philippines Stomach cancer Vitamin D Ojibwa Krill Turtle RuneScape Random Events French fries Leatherback Sea Turtle Trichinosis Orca Total parenteral nutrition Miso Thermal power station Roe Fishery Chinese cuisine Fire extinguisher Raw milk NP-complete Breast milk Apple Hamburger Tlingit Roman eating and drinking Cookware and bakeware Cyanocobalamin Japanese cuisine Sea turtle Plantain Rocko's Modern Life

corn snake seems aggressive or agitated during the past week i have a corn snake that seems to be agrivated dring the past week i took it outside to slither around for a while and when id pick him up to move him away from the bushes he'd tense up and hiss at me i also noticed he is bleeding from where he poops i'm not sure if it's a male or female so i was wondering if it might be menstruating i don't know the cycles of a snake or if they even do have periods during the time of year they would usually be mating i don't know when snakes do mate aslo i had the lid to his cage sitting on my bed with a frozen mouse sitting on the lid to thaw i was playing a video game with the snake around my shoulders not paying attention and he got the frozen mouse so i was thinking maybe that could have caused some damage to his body i'm hoping thats not the case though i would really appreciate some help ive had the snake for over a year i think a year and a half it's on this green felt stuff they sell in pet stores for snakes plus he's no safer in your hands than he is on the ground it's just as dirty if not worse snakes natural habitat is on the ground i'm sure that has nothing to do with the problem and i dont appreciate your response i know i made a mistake with the frozen mouse which was still mostly frozen but it was an accident i've already called an exotic vet to come to my house because no places around here do snakes but i'm only interested in the response of someone who's going to tell me the answeres to my questions not toss around their oppinions of me well with the slithering around on the ground thing i don't know i only let him slither around on my driveway wich is all little stones he really seems to enjoy himself when i take him out though that's why i do it i like giving him a chance to stretch out and i'm sure he likes it too his previous owner took him outside too that's where i got the idea he has never acted like this to me before either he was an aggresive snake before i got him said his previous onwer and he'd even bite her and her sister he has never bitten me though never even flicked his tale besides the first few days i had him he's about to feet long i'm not sure how old he is though he just shed about or days ago then got the mouse a day or so after that so or days ago but when he was acting agitated with me i was kind of afriad to pick him up because if the mouse did cause damage i dont want to hurt him more but like i said i have called an exotci vet and she's on her way tomorrow i talked to the vet she looked at the snake and said everything was fine she said the frozen mouse it ate should have thawed enough inside the snake to avoid causing any damage because my room is always in the lower to mid 's she said the snake wasn't bleeding it's just the color of the scales and the way the light hits it when you apply a little pressure to the area i forgot what she called it where he poops i think it started with a t i can't believe i've never noticed it before she said he's a very healthy corn and i set up his habbitat perfect but i might want to think about investing in a larger tank it is currently l ' x w ' x depth is foot i'm not sure how many gallons that is but i'm gonna go quite a bit bigger and try to get another corn snake or i have definately learned from my mistake though from now on the snake stays in the cage until the mouse is completely thawed not to be rude but you really do not need a snake if he she is bleeding something is wrong it could be serious not knowing what kind of bedding you are using for the tank i would say it could be an impaction you really need to take this snake to the vet he should have never been put on the ground that is a good way for him to pick up parasites if the mouse was still pretty frozen you could end up with a dead snake if it was thawed completely you are lucky  Hamster Shaggy dog story Social rule Guinea pig Fancy rat Piccolo Junior Saga Milton H.

should i get a second mouse my boyfriend's sister gave us a mouse as a pet which was supposed to fed to her snake the mouse is very sweet and loves to be held but i read that mice are social creatures and should be kept in pairs or groups the problem is that our mouse is male and we were told that you shouldn't keep two non littermate males in the same cage but we don't want babies so getting a female is out of the question i just want the little guy to be happy would it be best to keep him as an only mouse and just make sure he gets a lot of attention get a second male mouse and just hope they get along get a different species of critter like a female dwarf hamster so they can be social but not have babies suggestions would be appreciated thanks where can i get my mouse fixed do regular vets do it is it expensive i have a pet mouse and he is an only mouse and is perfectly happy just so long as you give him lots of love and attention as other answerers have said make sure he has lots of activities in his cage an empty toilet roll tube works wonders and also handle him atleast every other day or every day if possible he's used to being on his own now and is so glad he didn't end up as snake food man i hate that feeding live mice to a snake i know it would happen in the wild but if the snake is domesticated as far as you can domesticate a snake you should feed it freeze dried mice if they have died of natural causes if they are killed just to feed the snake then that is wrong also when my little lucky dies he will be buried in my moms garden along side all my fish that are buried there too i'm so attached to the cute little mouse but have accepted that when he starts to suffer with his tumor the kindest thing to do is to take him to be euthanised i'm going giving him a bath now don't think he'll like it much though but he does enjoy being dried by my hairdryer later  Hamster Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Garfield Ferret Fancy rat RuneScape quests Trapping Guinea pig Phoebe Buffay's songs House Mouse Chicken Theory of conduct Felis sapiens EastEnders The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Futurama (TV series - season 2) Elephant Spidey Super Stories Domestic rabbit Livestock Little Britain FoxTrot Pok__mon Live!

i'm planning to get a lizard for my birthday i'm planning to get a lizard i'm from the uk so with food the tank and all other needs how much will it cost all together there's a lot of things to consider before you do this what type of lizard do you want is it herbivorous omnivorous or carnivorous how big does it get what type of lighting heating substrate does it need how much humidity does it need reptiles are every bit as big a responcibility as a dog or a cat in some ways they're more of a responcibility they can live a lot longer than 'conventional pets' and have to be socialized played with often many times they will end up needing much larger and more expensive enclosures as adults than they do as babies and it's incredibly hard to find a good reptile vet when they get sick my suggestion is this buy a book on the lizard species you're thinking of getting and study it hard ultimately a lizard may not be the best choice of a pet but if it is the book is definately worth the investment also do not get a heat rock for any lizard as they can easily burn themselves to death on it read the guidelines for heating out of the book and follow them the initial cost of a lizard can vary greatly from eighty us dollars for the lizard and setup to many thousands of dollars for the same my honest reccomendation is if you've never had a reptile before get an anole or a leopard gecko they're the easiest to care for don't take up a lot of space and can be a lot of fun inital cost of both of these is between sixty and two hundred us dollars don't know the pound equivalents sorry i do hope this helps  Lizard Reptile Dog Gecko Cat Tyrannosaurus rex Carnivore Ferret Creatures in Bionicle Garfield Hydrogen economy Solar power Marine aquarium Brown Bear Fauna of Australia Pet Leopard gecko Livestock Snake Welding Social rule Solar cell Crocodilia Tiger Minor Harry Potter Beasts Paleocene Polychrotidae Cruising (maritime) Health insurance Microeconomics Alcohol fuel Timeline of alternative rock Cheetah Fancy rat Nuclear power Gerald Durrell Tooth Theory of conduct American Alligator Carnivora Domestic rabbit Leopard Explosive material Capital accumulation Cryptozoology Ra (board game) Pet store Bearded Dragon Thermoregulation Largest organism Endangered species United States dollar Lizard (comics) Euro Extreme Programming Sewage treatment Internal ballistics Carnivorous plant Illegal drug trade Dialysis Broadband Internet access Pitaten Care Bears Bicycle lighting Kodocha RuneScape quests Fossil Scientology beliefs and practices Hard disk Hyperinflation Puma Veterinarian Solar panel Sea-Monkey Tetrapod Leatherback Sea Turtle Microchip implant (animal) Carbon dioxide Plesiosaur Alcoholics Anonymous Discus (fish) Lighting Autonomous building Discordianism Tooth enamel The Fairly OddParents CPU design Neopets Divorce Password

ball python food question ok i am wondering if it sounds like a good idea to breed two mice so i don't have to buy them all the time and i also have chameleon that i occasionally feed it mice as a treat so i think it would save me a couple bucks not a bad idea at all just keep in mind that mice have litters meaning they can have anywhere between babies in a litter i am also doing this to keep from paying per mouse for my ball python baby mice grow fast so figure out how often you feed the snake and how big the snake is and what size mice you feed it because you may feed it pinkies now and then at the next couple of feedings the baby mice will have grown and you may not have pinkies but fuzzies or hoppers a little fact for ya after the female has had babies remove the male mouse from the same cage because male mice will eat the babies also keep in mind that mice can have babies and get pregnant again within a few days after having babies  House Mouse Hamster Shen Gong Wu Domestic rabbit Chicken Cat Fancy rat Garter snake Elephant Paintball Pet skunk Timon and Pumbaa Rocko's Modern Life Tasmanian Devil Garfield Pinky and the Brain Mickey Mouse Breastfeeding Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Yoshi Toilet humour Monty Python Tigon I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Hip hop collaborations Gypsy moth Copyright Shaggy dog story Ball python Snake charming Taboo food and drink Snake Tiny Toon Adventures Aquemini Ron and Fez Fasting Pregnancy Bird Red Squirrel Kitten Kakapo Sea-Monkey Black Pete Animaniacs Burmese python The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Milk Internet phenomenon Who Framed Roger Rabbit Python Hedgehog Mouse Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Infant Drawn Together Jeopardy! in culture Britney Spears Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968 Beanie Baby Brown Rat W.

yes i already knew geckos get rid of bugs how can i really get rid of them i would rather pay the pest control more often to get rid of bugs then to always have geckos running around so if anyone has a good solution feel free oh and i know there harmless i don t care and can t help it they freak me out thanks i understand that moth balls repel them but they stink so maybe anything with camphor like tiger balm laxman rekha use glue traps and baygon spray to kill bugs that they feed on rid yourself of bugs and i am sure they won't stick around glue boards are supposed to work but then you will have a live stuck lizard and that's gross bleach and other antiseptic cleaners like lysol triclosan etc will not only keep them from walking but in certain area but control anything they might carry they have salmonella like all reptiles egg shells apparently work get a cat a bunch of peacock feathers they don't like feathers or sprayed them with cold water so you can catch them that causes them to lose their grip and land wherever and become slow and sluggish so easy to catch cage and relocate  Mosquito Snake Dinosaur RuneScape quests Carnivorous plant Minor Harry Potter Beasts Mario Bros.

corn snakes what temperature is optimum for a baby corn snake to digest its food i have had the snake a week and set the tank up so one side is degrees c and the other degrees c it struck for its food well two pinkies as previously advised to feed it once a week it is twelve weeks old any other advice would be welcome as this is my first snake also i dont intend to use it to breed so is it likely to bruminate if the tank is at a constant temperature range as i have set it up those temperatures are just fine see the great thing about snakes is given they have a good temp gradient they will take care of finding the perfect temperature within the tank the only thing that might change with your snake is during the spring and usually only if its a male he may stop feeding for around months corns are not extremely variable but this may happen but more as he gets older once a week is perfectly fine to feed although if its that old i usually feed mine more wen they are that young about every days  Temperature Breastfeeding Thermoregulation Chicken Dog Sorghum Goldfish Bird migration RuneScape Mini-Games Maize Anopheles Vitamin C Garter snake E85 Platypus Botulism Shark Domestic rabbit Graduate school Clownfish Carburetor Hamster Cat Explosive material Snake charming Discus (fish) Capercaillie Stomach cancer Albatross Global warming and agriculture Fancy rat Sewage treatment Agriculture Welding American Alligator Shaggy dog story Dialysis Bird Brewery Avalanche Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater PID controller Canary Jet engine Combine harvester Vermicompost Alcohol fuel Raw food diet Transformer Atlanta metropolitan area Climate of Salt Lake City Emu Aquarium Axolotl Apollo 13 Vacuum Gas metal arc welding USS Tunny (SS-282) Climate of the United Kingdom Pit viper Arizona Diamond simulant Warm-blooded Red Squirrel BZFlag Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Diseases of the honeybee Seabird Laura Schlessinger The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Battle of Kursk Nuclear fusion Falconry Wheat Equine conformation Advance fee fraud Homeostasis Brewing Solar variation Foie gras Chinese New Year Guinea pig Ferret Gradient Education in Germany Desert Cold-blooded Paintball London Congestion Charge Fish Pasteurization Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake M4 Sherman Sandy Koufax Krill Hemp Winter Fuzzy logic Robot Master

why dont people like reptiles and arachnids just kinda a recent question exept i added arachnids also im wondering how to get other people over their aracniphobia thanks it's funny we aren't actually born afraid of these things if you show a little kid a spider or a snake they want to touch it they're not scared of them so we're taught to be afraid of them through others and especially the media and think of halloween decorations scccary spiders what people should do if they want to get over these types of phobias is to meet with someone who's experienced with the animal and let the expert explain the truth about the species like interesting facts maybe later on have a harmless specimen brought in that they can look at and touch if they want my mom was less than thrilled when i brought my three and a half ft ball python rescue home her eyes nearly popped out of her head and she said something along the line of oh my god whenever she first tried to touch him she'd pull away as if expecting the snake to bite her now she'll hold out her arm for him to climb on as long as i'm still holding part of the snake she feels safe around him all of her friends and our relatives are disgusted and shocked she let me bring the python into the house she's still terrified of tarantulas but we'll cure these phobias one at a time remember baby steps  Shaggy dog story Spider Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tarantula Snake Snake charming Garfield Moult Creatures in Bionicle Monty Python Milton H.

if you have leos please answer i have a leo and so does my brother they are in different cages and one is a girl and we do not know the sex of mine i have not played with mine in a long time and i picked it up today and it hissed me and bit me times i was trying to see if it was a boy or a girl and i was so scared that i dropped it i don't ever play with it and my brother plays with his he has a huge tank i mean like gallons and only one gecko in it mine is a gallon and i one in it too can we put our leos in the same cage his a a little bigger and nicer then mine also how can i get my gecko out of it's cage with out him her biting me so that i can tell the gender i tried picking her up with a wash cloth and she yelped and it scared me so i dropped her again last time i time my brother even got scared when she did that could i reach in there and scoop her in the clear glass go slower remember you are thousands of times bigger than she is start by putting your hand in the tank and leaving it there wait until she comes over and investigates don't try to pick her up let her lick you and walk on your hand get some wax worms and hold them in your hand while your leopard gecko eats them then when she's totally comfortable with you start raising your hand a little when she climbs on it then you can gently but firmly start to pick her up from below and holding her but go slow over a couple of weeks she needs to know that you aren't going to hurt her i hardly ever handle my leopard geckos but if you learn to approach them without scaring them you can minimize your chances of getting bit i will agree that if they are both females then yes you can put them together males will kill each other and a male and female combo will stress each other out breeding is very hard on females and unless you are committed to doing it right and have somewhere to sell the babies it isn't worth it  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Aerial (dance move) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sin City Equine conformation Ron and Fez Social rule Gecko Naval mine Skateboarding trick Lion RuneScape Random Events Dog training Salad Fingers RuneScape quests Milton H.

corn snake question what plant can i put in a corn snakes cage or fake and how would you stirlize a stick you found outside and can corns get an illeness from it being too humid any houseplant that doesn't grow too rapidly will be a good choice to put with a snake and although the snake probably won't take a bite of anything it's better to stay away from the more poisonous varieties like pothos and stay with the non toxic variety these include the aluminium plant pilea most dracaena species which include 'lucky bamboo' jade plants most crassula's which include cultivars like gollum and hobbit both of which are very interesting to look at and aeschynanthus also called lipstick plant all of which will tolerate the bright light required of a snake enclosure and don't have specific humidity requirements in lower humidity environments you may have to water the plants lightly every few days but most are succulents that shouldn't be watered too often corn snakes should have humidity a little higher if they're shedding and don't have access to a large contaner of clean water where they can bathe they're not picky about humidity our corn snake lived many a year in texas where the daytime humidity was over watch it when winter rolls around especially if using overhead heating because the humidity will fall and may need to be supllimented with a warm water spray bottle  Houseplant Hamster Cat Carnivorous plant Snake Maize Chicken Alcohol fuel Rice Sorghum Water Air conditioning Apple Wheat Dracaena (plant) Biodiesel Humidity Garden Strawberry Caving Autonomous building Cereal Sewage treatment Global warming and agriculture Mushroom hunting Sauna Renewable energy Leaf Organic farming Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Diseases of the honeybee Nuclear power Cookware and bakeware Coffee Cannabis cultivation First aid Hiking Light-emitting diode Carbon dioxide Brewery Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Transgenic maize Jute Banana Fruit tree propagation Sage Peanut Welding Vitamin C Garter snake Pachypodium Fancy rat Water (molecule) San Pedro cactus Common cold Severe weather terminology (United States) The Hobbit Peach Tillandsia Atlanta metropolitan area Stoma Cannabis (drug) Violin Orchidaceae Citrus Lighting Weed control Ecology Mercury (element) Chile pepper E85 Sweet potato Tetrapod Hydrogen economy Plant Gollum Tobacco Agriculture Professional wrestling match types Potato Florida Keys Poison Mario series enemies Canary Ecology of Hong Kong Gooseberry Weather lore Green Revolution Future energy development Chernobyl accident Water vapor Cactus Hybrid Shaggy dog story Chopsticks

is a x x inch long vivarium ok for a fully gorwn beardie it is also gallons nope sorry an adult beardie can grow up to inches long so you're gonna need something that is more of a cage and less of a coffin try giving him something that is at least twice his length long his length wide and one and a half his length tall so if he's two feet long you're looking at feet long two feet wide and three feet high but that's the minimum you want to be giving him if you're having trouble finding a tank for him as a dessert animal he doesn't have to be in ultra wet humiditys so you can build a netting sort of terrium for him to crawl around on on top just nail a bunch of metal wire stuff to two by fours just make sure it's good and sturdy and that the holes in the netting isn't big enough for him to get his leg through or he could get caught and break things  Textile manufacturing Laws of cricket Drill bit Volleyball Poker jargon English unit Equine conformation Seismic retrofit Nine Inch Nails Fast bowling Knife Violin Horseshoe Barbed wire Campfire Terminal ballistics Dodge Charger Tire Stairway Rail tracks Professional wrestling holds Basketball Diving Pachypodium baronii Scale model Chair Childbirth Screw Carbon dioxide Tokusatsu Hamster Slide rule Firearm U.S. customary units Dog agility Wire Professional wrestling attacks Clarinet Apollo Command/Service Module Super Mario 64 Cruising (maritime) Floppy disk Drywall Punt (boat) View camera Smelt Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Doom enemies Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Roller hockey Goaltender Broomball Mattress Professional wrestling match types Table tennis Strap-on dildo Marine aquarium Brush Lacrosse Puberty Shark Guinea pig Combine (Half-Life 2) Junk (ship) Hair Domestic rabbit Paper size Brewery Shotgun Trapping Fancy rat Codename: Kids Next Door Billiards Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Make money fast RuneScape quests Aerial (dance move) Cannabis cultivation Time Out of Mind Fossil fuel power plant Jam (TV series) Pachypodium ambongense Coconut crab Imperial unit Torpedo Textile manufacturing terminology Glossary of firefighting equipment Quicksort Pok__mon Live!

when you feed a ball python is it safe to hold days after it has not used the bathroom yet though yes it's safe if you're waiting for it to excrete that could be a while i wait about two days before handling mine again what i like to do is wait until the bulge of the dead animal is no longer visible you just don't want to hold it too soon after it eats because a lot of motion could cause it to regurgitate also when fattened up with prey a snake is more vulnerable to attack if it gets stressed out it will regurgitate so when its body gets back to its normal look it's safe  Snake Albatross Toilet humour Vomiting Coprophagia Cat Gray Wolf Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Reptile Chicken Tag Python Aortic insufficiency Acorn Tasmanian Devil Traffic light Anorexia nervosa Spider Decompression sickness American Alligator Mitral regurgitation Animal communication Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Rugby league Monty Python's Flying Circus Cricket The Legend of Zelda series enemies Shark Euphemism Hamster First aid Domesticated turkey Professional wrestling throws Sandworm (Dune) Blood (computer game) Pythonidae Coconut crab Saw II Fecal incontinence Koala Ant Mouse (computing) Naval mine Weight training Tai Chi Chuan Car handling Livestock Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Biblical scientific foresight Fancy rat Little Shop of Horrors Vitamin C Piccolo Junior Saga Gun safety Cheetah Fugu Paintball Vampire Snake charming Vegetarianism RuneScape quests Leopard Equine conformation Columbine High School massacre Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Planetary orbit Bladderwort Ball python Cobra Commander Swimming RuneScape Random Events Eastern Front (World War II) Sun Natural Selection (computer game) Rod Stewart Feces Battle of the Bulge Acne Clean animals Foie gras Swingout Christian eschatology Airport House Mouse Melody of Oblivion Monty Python Dog Aerial (dance move) Treehouse of Horror IX The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Four square Fast bowling Seabird Movie projector Beetle Insect Triage American football

can you pick up a ball python while it's in a ball well if your snake is in a ball its obviously because it is feeling a little scared if the snake does this every time you pick it up you may need to handle it more at the same time dont handle it every day because if the snake is timid you dont want to stress it out to much so handle the snake every other day for lets say ten minutes at a time eventually you can start to lengthen the time you handle it at a time this should help with the shyness so to answer your question yes you can handle your snake when its in a ball because you want to tame it a little more but not too often as it will cause stress also which could throw the bp off frozen thawed rodents but just keep a good balance and all will be fine  Snake charming Shaggy dog story Singlish Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Laws of cricket Norway national football team Creatures in Bionicle Croquet Cricket National Football League Lore Snake New York Giants Toilet humour Carbon dioxide Piccolo Junior Saga Skeletor Escape from New York Dodgeball Burmese python Aurelian Smith, Jr. The Contender (television series) Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Knife Cleveland Browns Happy Tree Friends Water polo Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Sydney Riot of 1879 Tag Pittsburgh Steelers Aerial (dance move) Cincinnati Bengals The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents Equine conformation Church of God with Signs Following Exception handling Ron and Fez Brian Close Volleyball Solid Snake The Life and Times of Juniper Lee American football Sly Cooper Ball python Sword making Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Wood carving Atomic Kitten Football (soccer) Shen Gong Wu Serpent Society Jennifer Lopez The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters Alignment (role-playing games) Cat Alex Trebek 1957 World Series Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes The Adventures of Pete & Pete Avalanche Touch football (rugby league) Socialization Avenue Q Ron Weasley Naruto jutsu Robot Master Hollywood Squares San Francisco 49ers Swingout Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Aquemini Everwood Extreme Programming Pitcher Sport Lincoln-Douglas Debate Blonde on Blonde Negro league baseball Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake Atlanta Campaign Deep Throat (Watergate) History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Weathering Isabella "Ivy" Valentine Reticulated Python Canadian football Bayesian probability Toss juggling Coming of Age (TNG episode) Rugby union Kender Snake handling Indian Oil Cup 2005 Super Bowl XII Aikido Susan Hawk Damn Yankees

whats the best captive habitat for a snapping turtle i found a snapping turtle shell is about inches across on the side of the road and brought it home what the best type of tank setup for it i know that they live in the mud swamps here's the basics on snapping turtle care get the largest tank you possibly can i have several snappers each in a separate stock tank the water does not need to be deep just deep enough so they are submerged they do not need a basking platform as they do not bask they should have a power filter but they are messy and it will need frequent cleaning you don't need gravel and you certainly don't need mud feed it bait minnows not goldfish rodents crawdads and insects they can live a long time i've had one of mine years here's a useful site http www chelydra org snapping turtles are aggressive but their danger is overrated a common snapping turtle cannot sever the finger of an adult human a gator snapper can though and it most certainly can't bite a baseball bat in half that is pure fiction aquamarinequeen a large specimen might be able to bite a pencil in half but i haven't tried it handle them by the rear of the shell folding the legs back so they cannot claw you do not carry them by the tail good luck  Snapping turtle Fauna of Australia American Alligator Hamster Leatherback Sea Turtle Pok__mon Snap Tarantula Bat Crocodile Coconut crab Tank Dinosaur Elephant Submarine Gal__pagos Islands Conker's Bad Fur Day Glossary of American football Minor Harry Potter Beasts Professional wrestling holds Taikyoku shogi Plesiosaur Textile manufacturing Creatures in Bionicle American lobster Professional wrestling throws Gray Wolf Turtle Thermal power station Leopard Anchor Dairy Xenomorph Equine conformation Rocky Mountain spotted fever Dog Unreal Basking Shark Violin Orca Fishing Seabird Tetrapod Insect Gharial Evidence of evolution Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time Reptile Bass guitar Bedbug Tyrannosaurus rex Geology of the British Isles Beaver Cat USS Tunny (SS-282) Drill bit American Black Bear Aquarium Shrimp farm Platypus Baseball USS Snapper (SS-185) Snap (American football) Tuatara D'ni wildlife Marine aquarium Strap-on dildo Goldfish Green Sea Turtle Tag Virginia Opossum Clownfish Tire Katana Axolotl Punt (boat) Crayfish Common Unix Printing System Ecology of Hong Kong Animal New York Giants Biodiversity of New Zealand Termina Motorcycle Brewery T-72 Tiger I Mark I (tank) Shell (projectile) Wombat American football strategy Fast bowling Angling Sea turtle Cheetah Travel trailer Ant The Legend of Zelda series enemies Piccolo Junior Saga

snake owners i want a snake really badly and i've been wondering what the up and downsides of having one are do they really stink up the house is it safe to have a poisonous snake what kind of snake makes the best pet these are just a few of my questions so please give me as much info as you can is it safe to have a poisonous snake o honey just read over the question i think you'll find the answer on your own only professional herpetologists should attempt to keep poisonous snakes snakes don't have odors if the snake tank smells then you're neglecting it the best pet snake is the ball python very docile and slow moving they are one of the most hesitant species to strike they're a little more expensive than a corn or king snake but overall i like their personalities much better snakes are not like cats and dogs they don't love you and don't yearn for you to pet them in their minds they are wild animals i'm not saying there can't be a bond between a snake and its owner they can trust when you first buy a snake it'll be pretty expensive you'll need all the necessary equipment and then the snake itself plus vet bills if the snake hasn't recently been to one once you have all those things though day to day owning a snake isn't very expensive despite what so many claim you can get any snake to feed on thawed rodents it's just a matter of finding out how they want it took me two months with my rescue ball python fun fun fun a lot of people don't want reptiles because they're afraid they'll get salmonella while it is possible you're far more likely to get it from bad meat and dairy products follow a few simple rules and you'll be fine keep the snake's tank clean scrub out its water bowl every day don't lick kiss or otherwise put any part of the snake in your mouth lol don't put your hands near your mouth after holding your snake wash your hands well before and after holding the snake just as they can transfer salmonella onto our hands we can transport harmful chemicals onto them keep both yourself and the snake safe this next one could be good or bad depending on the owner snakes live an average of yrs ball pythons can live up to yrs if you don't think you'll be able to keep a snake that long don't buy one there are already thousands of snakes out there without homes don't add anothe to the list that's some of the pros and cons i really thoroughly enjoy my pet snakes  Cat Hamster Snake Pet skunk Snake charming Shaggy dog story Foodborne illness Ferret Skunk Social rule Theory of conduct RuneScape quests Donald Rumsfeld Fancy rat Garfield Guinea pig Dairy V.F.D.

year old son wants a reptile what kind of reptile would be good for a year old i do reptile programs for our local libraries and children's museum i always tell parents that either a bearded dragon or a ball python are good choices for a first reptile because they are sturdy and will tolerate alot of handling they are also of a pretty even temperament and not liable to bite your child and they do not harbor salmonella as most aquatic turtles do you may prefer a bearded dragon because the only live prey it will eat is crickets they are basically vegetarians both are inexpensive and do not require a great deal to set up an enclosure a tank with a top a source of uv light bedding and a water dish you may also need to provide a heat pad during the colder months i suggest placing it under the tank so your reptile does not injure itself  Reptile Tuatara Leatherback Sea Turtle Creatures in Bionicle V.F.D.

i finally got my tortoise eating are bananas safe we tried stawberries lettuce and even tomatoes and he would smell them but not eat them we finally put out some apple pieces and he liked them so we tried a tiny piece of banana and we found out that they are his favorite now is this safe for tortoises from your previous question i see you are asking about a desert tortoise some species can tolerate more fruit then others but with deserts it should be kept to a minimum it is safe but the high sugar content can cause digestive problems with your species you can however use a small amount of mashed ripe bananna mixed in with more suitable food in order to coax him into eating a broader range of greens and grasses  Hamster Mango Tomato Cuisine of the Philippines Jewish cuisine Guinea pig Coconut crab Banana Fruit Cuisine of the Southern United States Plantain Tooth Wine Peruvian cuisine Food preservation Cuisine of Singapore Diarrhea Flowering plant Japanese cuisine Beer Cuisine of Africa Potato Apple Brewery Sandworm (Dune) Healthy eating Dim sum Cat Hamburger Cuisine of Brazil Bengali cuisine Garlic Minor Harry Potter Beasts Acorn Ecology Date Palm Dietary fiber Vitamin C Cuisine of Denmark Sewage treatment Frugivore Stomach cancer Crohn's disease Food Pomegranate Cuisine of Argentina Carnivorous plant McDonald's Phelsuma Grasshopper Alcohol fuel Tofu Desert Tortoise Genetically modified food Fancy rat Common bean Compost Domesticated turkey American Black Bear Omega-3 fatty acid Vomiting Fruitarianism Jam Ant Domestic rabbit Nutrition Cheese Peanut butter Hot dog Gal__pagos Islands Bird migration Chlorophyta Sea-Monkey Hypoglycemia Perfume Capsicum Golf Creatures in Bionicle Chinese cuisine Agriculture Cantonese cuisine Breakfast The Mind of an Ape German cuisine Vegetarianism Watermelon Hydroponics Starch Caffeine Veganism Foodborne illness Chile pepper Mammee apple Plum Bread Ice cream Bamboo Pawpaw Cannabis cultivation Agriculture in Australia

i am wanting to breed crickets need an oppinion though i did some research on how to breed crickets but most of them have a picture of a lid on the little nesting container with a hole cut in the top with some screen so they can stick the ovipositor the long stinger looking thing on their bottom through the screen and lay the eggs in the damp soil but most of the breeders said to leave the top on it but i don't understand do to the fact that what happens when they sprout they will be trapped so what should i do i think you should leave the lid on until they sprout then take it off  Textile manufacturing Honeybee Bee Chicken Mouse (computing) Ant Diseases of the honeybee Hamster Africanized bee Monster Rancher monsters Golf Sequoia Platypus Beehive (beekeeping) Top-bar hive Potato Minor Harry Potter Beasts Chernobyl accident Osprey Apocrita Jennifer Lopez Origins of baseball Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Robot Wars Condor Gray Wolf Sea turtle Mosquito Dobermann Resident Evil: Apocalypse Ostrich Buckfast bee Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker 2005 English cricket season Seabird Tin can House Sparrow Tarantula Sandpit Gypsy moth Agriculture Wasp Grasshopper Hemp Heraldry Nepenthes Swarming (honeybee) 2003 Cricket World Cup Netsuke Pringles Cockroach European Rabbit Anopheles Peregrine Falcon Percula Clownfish Sea-Monkey Giant Sequoia The Ark in Space Tea Brood (honeybee) Capercaillie Resident Evil (film) John Cage Organic food Naval mine Drone (bee) Kyoryuu Sentai ZyuRanger Double the Fist Distribution board Fire fighting Cannabis cultivation Aluminum can Elevator House Mouse Escherichia coli O157:H7 Tobacco Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Gharial Drill bit Humphrey Bogart Digimon Wood Stork Diatom Mountain Plover Australian cricket team Pinball Fujian tea ceremony American Pit Bull Terrier Symphyta Chinese tea Marilyn Monroe Professional wrestling attacks Rigging Eggerland series History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Diving suit Alien vs. Predator (film) Sydney Riot of 1879 Sushi

could a texas horned lizard a flying gecko and an armadillo lizard live together in the same cage all three of the lizards are the same size so i was wondering if i got the three of them if they could live together ohhhh boy you making all the wrong decisions i don't know where to start my primary area of research husbandry is with phrynosoma horned lizards and the picture on my avatar is of a texas horned lizard i am a member of the horned lizard conservation society and run a reptile rescue first the texas horned lizard is protected in every state where it is native except az but az still requires a hunting permit it is unlawful to possess transport buy or sell a texas horned lizard without permit only thls legally obtained from az or legally captive bred through commercial propagation permits can be bought or sold to the public and not many people actually have those permits or can prove the legal origin of the lizard i suggest you check that out before buying as it is more likely than not that any thl you find on the market is on the market illegally next the texas horned lizard or any other horned lizard does not make a good pet for anyone without experience and by that i mean a lot of experience i have years of herp experience of the recognized species in north america the thl is one of the hardest to keep alive in captivity they are highly prone to stress and this will kill them without a proper habitat and other conditions such as diet being properly met it sounds like you haven't done enough research to have such as proper habitat and don't have the experience horned lizards also primarily eat harvester ants as a large percentage of their diet they are obligate ant eaters in the wild and need harvester ants to be healthy there are too many biological reasons for this that i won't go into detail here but it suffices to say that you will have to mail order large quantities of harvester ants in order to feed a horned lizard typically they run about per ants and the typical hl can eat ants in one week so think about that there is a reason that not many people have horned lizards and that they are pretty much left to the experts and those with money that's because they are expensive to feed and they have very high mortality rates in captivity more than of all horned lizards taken into captivity will die in inexperienced hands they are closing in on the brink of extinction and i would prefer if you left this genus of lizard to the experts to be honest first general rule of reptile keeping is that you don't keep different species or different genus for god's sake together without a good deal of experience an outdoor habitat and being damn sure they are compatable and certified healthy and free of parasites the lizards you are talking about keeping together don't even live in the same parts of the world together jeez the armadillo and thl have similar climate preferences but are from different continents the flying gecko is from jungle habitat and could never live in the climates the other prefers all of these lizards would highly stress if you placed them together the armadillo and thl are very shy and will always be scared of one another the armadillo will stay curled up in a ball and the thl will probably be constantly climbing the walls trying to get out and eventually break it's tail the gecko would be running around stressing and somebody would end up getting a respiratory infection either from too little or too much humidity please until you get some real experience try sticking to an easy species one species and just one of that species leopard and some other geckos make good herps for beginners as well as anoles or a cornsnake i guarantee you based on your question i have confiscated horned lizards from people who had more experience than you do that's just the facts sorry but i have to say it because i care about herps and i'm a conservationist and rescuer my pages http freewebs

turtle they should have a half filled aquarium with at least a third of the tank devoted to a 'drying out' area set above the water but easily accessible these are usually made of simulated wood stacked to be above the water the tank should be at least a gallon for one turtle but a gallon tank is an excellent choice you can use gravel to line the bottom of the tank if you want to but it should be large enough so it won't fit in the turtle's mouth you'll need a heating lamp usually sold for snakes to set above the basking spot and another full spectrum reptile uva uvb should be provided this full spectrum light is necessary for proper calcium metabolism the only snail i would introduce to a turtle tank would be 'pest' snails pond snails and malaysian burrowing snails called trumpet snails as both breed asexually and will reproduce a lot of snails in very little time your turtle will have a snack and they won't get out of control you can probably get both types of snails free from any pet store that has an aquatics section as they are pests and no one really wants them in a fish tank tank sizes a rule of thumb is the water should be twice as deep as your turtle is long a inch turtle will need inches of water a inch turtle the max size for a red ear will need a whopping inches of water with enough room above the water to provide a suitable basking spot and to ensure the turtle won't get out for what red ears eat see here http exoticpets about com od aquaticturtles f feedingturtles htm the length of the tank should be long enough to provide enough swimming space which should be or times as long as your turtle is a inch turtle will need inches of swimming space and a big enough basking spot in addition to this the tank will also require a heater to keep the temperature at degrees a filter to keep the water reasonably clean both of which have to be protected from the turtle's curiosity frogs are a little bit easier to care for and won't harm guppy's that are too big to fit in their mouth aquatic frogs require a setup exactly as a fish aquarium a suitable tank size heater filter and substrate small aquarium gravel live or plastic plants can be used and there should be a feeding dish sunken into the substrate enough that the lip of the dish is level with the substrate african dwarf frogs are the most common aquatic frog kept and they are relatively easy to care for they require a well cycled tank some special feeding and a few hiding spots and they're happy adf's skin is sensitive hence the requiring of an established tank they hunt by motion snapping at anything that moves nearby them so people most often thaw frozen food like bloodworms and mix them with some tank water then suck them into a turkey baster and squirt it into the submerged dish you might also try taking some tweezers and wiggling some cleaned earthworm pieces in front of them the frogs will live peacefully with the snails but the guppies might eat the frogs' food before the frogs can get to it the only aquatic snail i would recommend to keep with your frogs are the snails sold as 'mystery snails' which require one of each gender to reproduce and when they do their eggs are easy to spot and get rid of some pet stores actually buy adult specimens if you do end up with a breeding pair and happen to get more the variety 'golden inca snail' actually grows quite large from golf ball to baseball size but they're a very nice yellow gold red eared slider information http exoticpets about com cs reptilesturtles a reslidercare htm adf information http

can i put in turtle clean with my turtle still in the tank i got this new product that's called turtle clean can i put that in the tank with my turtle still in it or should i take him out i use turtle clean too it's a really good product it's fine to put it in when the turtle is in the tank but you'll want to dilute it in water first if this is your first time using the turtle clean i'd suggest doing a partial water change in your tank take out about half the water add the turtle clean to the new water you put in this shouldn't disturb the turtle too much check the bottle but i think you'll need to add one teaspoon per gallons of water be sure to base that on the total amount of water in the tank for the initial use not just the new water next time you clean the tank or add water just use the maintenance dosage i find that when using turtle clean you don't need to clean the whole tank nearly as often but you may still go through a lot of filter cartridges since it breaks down the waste and a lot of it gets into the filter  Brewery Dry cleaning Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Water purification Hydrogen economy Motor oil E85 Aquarium Autonomous building Dialysis Wine making Hydrogen vehicle Biodiesel Taikyoku shogi Rum Dairy Fire extinguisher Thermal power station Energy development Dishwasher Cruising (maritime) Propeller Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Coffee Nuclear power PID controller Champagne (beverage) Textile manufacturing M60 machine gun Turtle Beaches of Hong Kong Fire fighting Concentration Depleted uranium Volume Bhopal disaster Vinegar Gasoline Water Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time Nuclear fallout Carburetor Flush toilet Microeconomics Sulfuric acid Home repair Environmental concerns with electricity generation Mark I (tank) Social rule B-47 Stratojet Logo programming language Tank Leatherback Sea Turtle Sea-Monkey Slow sand filter bed Milk Hydrogen peroxide Fish farming Sugar beet Bong The Turtles Fossil fuel power plant Reef tank Three Mile Island Cannabis cultivation Thermal depolymerization Camping (computer gaming) The Apprentice 2 Shrimp farm Automobile emissions control BZFlag Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze Sewer Apollo 8 Tea Space Shuttle program Japanese toilet Essential oil Homebrewing Internal ballistics Town gas Toyota Prius Electrophysiology Menstrual cup M1 Abrams Water (molecule) Snapping turtle Tank locomotive F-16 Fighting Falcon P-47 Thunderbolt Command & Conquer: Generals - Zero Hour Hydrochloric acid Honda CX series MS-06 Zaku II Vickers Valiant NEWater

how many crikets worms or pinkies should i give my bearded dragon a day juveniles insects and veggies feed times a day enough crickets that they can eat in about minutes and make sure there are no crickets left in there overnight always have leafy greens such as dandelion greens collard greens chicory greens mustard greens turnip greens escarole parsley but no iceberg lettuce as it has no nutritional value or spinach it is bad for them available adults insects and veggies feed times a day enough crickets that they can eat in minutes and fresh leafy greens same as for juveniles remember some beardies don't like to eat greens so if they won't try throwing in some live crickets to their bowl of greens and they will eat the crickets along with the greens and soon they will be eating the greens on their own and also remember to chop up the greens very fine they can't chew and don't have teeth don't leave greens in their tanks for more than hours to prevent spoilage pinkies should not usually be fed to a beardie because of the unneccesary high ammount of protein and the hard to digest bones they have hope this helps also don't listen to the person who replied above he has no idea what he is talking about because mali uromastyxes and bearded dragons are very different and have different housing feeding and temperature requirements they don't grow to be one foot long even the smallent breed they are inches fully grown also you didn't ask for a care sheet on uromastyxes so why on earth did he give you one you didn't ask for a complete care sheet either and it's obvious that he just copied and pasted it off the internet without even reading it beforehand  Guinea pig Hamster Tofu Tooth Veganism Laws of cricket Fancy rat Spider Hamburger Discus (fish) History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Vermicompost Chicken Domestic rabbit Common bean Milk Goldfish Healthy eating History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Collard greens Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 In-N-Out Burger Nutrition Hypoglycemia Capercaillie History of Test cricket (to 1883) Stomach cancer Fish farming Cricket Coffee Insect Raw food diet One Piece minor characters Jewish cuisine Vegetarianism Leaf Sydney Riot of 1879 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Arthropod Spinach Garlic Fugu Cheese Halitosis Lettuce Antarctic krill Elephant Mosquito Theory of conduct Dog Maize Animal Crossing Vitamin C Fecal incontinence Beetle Hey Jude Bengali cuisine Chili con carne Passover Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ant 2005 English cricket season West Indian cricket team Carnivorous plant Kitten Cat Fast bowling Kosher foods Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Diabetes mellitus English cricket team Grasshopper Fielding (cricket) Peanut Frugivore W.

burmese python how could i get a burmese python to be more tame even when she gets to be large and if she does start to constict me how do i get her off me without be coming snake food handle it as much as possible now while it is young only thing you can do to tame it but you need to realize that these are giant constrictors and any snake from a garter to an anaconda can have a bad day and turn for no reason there is always that danger the general rule is that you need a person per every foot of snake when it comes to handling as far as being constricted by a large snake you start at the tail to unwind if you can't get it unwinded due to strength or the way you are constricted grab the tail just below the vent and bend it sharply upwards and break the tail this sounds extreme but in a life or death situation you do what you gotta do keeping a knife on hand is good practice but whether you are able to use it or not depends on how it all plays out keep rubbing alcohol on hand snakes cannot stand it and it may cause the snake to let go also submerge it in cold water if possible this works well it you got a bite and the snake won't let go stick it's head underwater they'll let go or drown lastyly remember that if it is attacking you do everything you can to get it to release fighting it by sheer strength alone will not work no one can match their power use your brain go for the eyes head etc do whatever you can to get it to release you best defense is to know your snake to watch it's moves and learn its personality if it is acting strange put it away but never let your guard down fully  Snake Professional wrestling throws Drowning Professional wrestling holds Shaggy dog story Diving Burmese python Aurelian Smith, Jr. Swimming Escape from New York Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Snake charming Python Textile manufacturing Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Tenshinhan Backstroke Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Fast bowling Vegeta Blood (computer game) Knife Poker jargon Skateboarding trick Social rule Breaststroke Aikido Martial art Equine conformation Shen Gong Wu Whale Kill Bill Mixed martial arts Pikmin Rugby union positions Naruto jutsu Suicide methods Samurai Deeper Kyo Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Conspiracy (TNG episode) The Amber Spyglass Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Professional wrestling attacks Exception handling American Alligator USS Tunny (SS-282) Welding Boxing Anaconda Laws of cricket Naval mine First aid Theory of conduct Marching band Internal ballistics Tetrapod Creatures in Bionicle Sonic the Hedgehog Drill bit Craps Burma Campaign Wing Chun Sub-Zero Nicomachean Ethics Sea serpent Movie projector Characters of Lost Glossary of nautical terms Wood carving Sailing M16 (rifle) Butterfly stroke Treehouse of Horror IX Cat Sonic the Hedgehog 3 USS Trigger (SS-237) Drag racing Python programming language Baseball Deus ex machina Uzumaki Naruto Diver rescue Piccolo Junior Saga YuYu Hakusho Races of Final Fantasy Robot Master Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Rave Master Table tennis Stone Cold Steve Austin Kasparov versus The World Whitewater One Piece minor characters Ninja Scroll

how do i set up a tank for a eastern long necked turtle the australian snake necked turtle is generally shy as a rule but will adapt quickly to living in captivity and may eventually be one of the most rewarding turtles you can keep as a pet turtles that are not used to being handled will often emit a musky odor that dissipates after they become acclimated to being handled the australian snake necked turtle seems to adapt well to life in captivity they become tolerant of handling quickly and even those that are wild caught will eat from the hand within a couple of weeks the australian snake necked turtle is relatively easy to take care of you will need a large aquarium with basking space the temperature needs to be kept at a comfortable degrees fahrenheit some hobbyists suggest keeping the ph of the water in the tank low about this may help the turtle's development and help them avoid some skin problems peat or sphagnum moss will aid in lowering the ph of the water naturally if you live in a warmer environment the australian long necked turtle may do quite well in an outdoor pond preferably one with some plants around to keep its living space shielded from outsiders in the wild these turtles feed on mostly on aquatic and semi aquatic animals like small fish and small amphibians while captive your turtle will happily subsist on snails small fish and even worms these turtles do need some extra calcium in their diets so giving them a piece of cuttlebone might be a good idea  Aquarium Orca Hamster Marine aquarium Shrimp farm American Alligator Reptile Tetrapod Goldfish Carnivorous plant Fauna of Australia Fishing Clownfish Domestic rabbit Thermoregulation Discus (fish) Cat Fish farming Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Animal Garter snake Turtle Snapping turtle Ecology Gas metal arc welding Hibernation Snake Frog Guinea pig Tilapia Fancy rat Livestock Nile crocodile Sewage treatment Dinosaur Myxobolus cerebralis Creatures in Bionicle Hydrogen economy Sandworm (Dune) Sea serpent Vegetarianism Bladderwort Light pollution Leatherback Sea Turtle Chinchilla Cyanide Reef tank Water garden Zebra Danio Fish Agriculture Antarctic krill Swimming Plesiosaur Dairy Siphon Violin Domestication Lake Chicken Tiger Platypus Bog Sphagnum Sea-Monkey Hard water Giraffe Koi Autonomous building Dog Welding Ecology of Hong Kong Muskellunge Energy development Coconut crab Crocodile Aquaculture Virginia Beach, Virginia Veganism Bottlenose Dolphin Pet skunk Marine biology Species Evidence of evolution Aztec Krill Abenaki mythology Thermal power station Aquatic plant Sense

small skink and geacko care skinks are small australian lizards what do these animals eat what are there habitats like i don't have much experience with skinks but i had a leopard gecko they're not difficult to care for but the set up can be a little expensive they eat crickets mainly and you'll want to get special cricket food that has nutrients the gecko needs you can find it at most pet stores along with live crickets the other option is freeze dried crickets with added nutrients but they're a little more expensive fresh vegetables are never a bad idea to supplement their diet for a habitat you'll need a terrarium a fish tank will do but there are specific reptile sizes as well you'll also need some substrate for the bottom some people recommend sand or moss but i like the felt kind because it's easier to clean geckos and skinks are cold blooded so you'll need a basking light a red one is best for nocturnal reptiles and depending on the size of your terrarium possibly an under tank heater as well you want one side of the tank to be warmer than the other so he can easily regulate his body temp by moving from one side to the other about f for the hot side and to for the cooler side give or take a few degrees be sure to invest in a good thermometer your reptile will also need a place to hide a small hollow log works for this you may also want to add a branch below the basking light so he can get closer to it if he needs to warm up you'll also need a water dish and possibly a spray bottle or fogger to regulate the humidity an associate at a good pet store can show you the options for set up but be prepared to spend about to set up a basic habitat beyond the setup it's just a matter of tossing in a few crickets every other day or so and monitoring the levels of heat humidity and drinking water  Hamster Thermoregulation Gecko Autonomous building Reptile Carnivorous plant Nutrition Phelsuma Japanese tea ceremony Solar power Dieting Temperature Sewage treatment Tofu Prostate cancer Vegetarianism Marine aquarium Water Organic food Houseplant Fauna of Australia Lake Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Eumeces Lizard Raw food diet Bearded Dragon Cat Breastfeeding Kosher foods Earthworm Korean cuisine Guinea pig Leopard gecko Coffee Domestic rabbit American Alligator Leatherback Sea Turtle Brewery Irrigation Thermal power station Milk Dinosaur Cuisine of Denmark Fast bowling Chicken Vitamin C Carbon dioxide Pachypodium Tuatara Fugu Folic acid Bong Coconut crab Madagascar day gecko Hydroponics Colorectal cancer Dairy Cricket Alcoholic beverage Tarantula Dietary fiber Tocopherol Hiking German cuisine Chlorophyta Death Valley National Park Octopus Weather lore Cruising (maritime) Endangered species Eutrophication Pachypodium habitats Fecal incontinence Humidity Capercaillie Yosemite National Park Pea Five-lined Skink Organic farming Dog Bird Leopard Diving suit Cuisine of Brazil Goanna Hyperthermia Shrimp farm Snake Breakfast Chocolate

tank size for a hatchling corn snake i've been wanting to get a snake for many years and within the past six months or so after researching online i've decided on the corn snake my question is would a gal be too intimidating to a hatchling corn snake some sites say gal long is perfect others that it is minimum but bigger is better some say to start with a small tank and upgrade as the snake grows up others that it isn't necessary since in the wild the snakes obviously have quite a large space to live in i'd rather not have to buy more than one cage if necessary which is why i'd like to just buy the gal instead of starting small so my question is to the corn snake owners here what do you think will the hatchling be okay in the large tank or will he need a smaller one to start with would he be fine in the larger tank if i provided plenty of ground cover and hides i think a large tank with plenty of foliage and hiding places would be fine for a young corn snake naturally snakes in the wild would have plenty of room to roam around and i would think that a bigger tank would encourage the snake to move about his surroundings i have never found starting a young cornsnake in a bigger tank to be a problem and have talked with other snake owners who start hatchlings out in a bigger tank upgrading as the snake gets bigger is always an option however i think more people do that because they only have smaller tanks to start off will a gallon tank should be enough room for your snake for a lifetime of happiness and it will give him plenty of time to get used to his habitat for my corn snake i used a coconut rind bedding that comes in a brick like form you just soak it and add it to the cage it allows the snake to burrow and i have found it to be most successful personally i think it would be less stressful if you started him in the bigger one than if you were to constantly upgrade into new homes  Hamster Shaggy dog story Zerg Chicken Coconut crab Super Metroid Poker jargon RuneScape quests Toyota Prius Escape from New York Tank Domestic rabbit Thermal power station Samus Aran Nile crocodile Maize Fancy rat Leopard tank Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Dairy Solid Snake Wood carving Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Space Shuttle external tank Gallon Fish farming Surveillance Rice Laptop Chinchilla Alcohol fuel The Legend of Zelda series enemies Leopard Brewery Space Shuttle program Social rule Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Betting (poker) E85 Terran (StarCraft) Marine aquarium M.C.

help on my iguana i stepped on my baby iguana and a bubble popped out its butt and it went back in an hour later i think it was its guts but she still ate after that but now its been about a week and she is very sick and looks a brownish i got some antibiotic and dont know if i should let her have a little or just feed her to my ball python to take her out her misery is there anything i can do to help her i think you know the answer to your own question do what any resonable person would do and take it to a vat asap don't diagnose the problem yourself as from what you have written you don't seem capable now i am not having ago at you stepping on it accidents happen and i am willing to give you the benifit of the doubt but not taking it to a vet is animal abuse it does sound like a prolaps which if left long enough will be fatal if the bowl is left out side of the body too long it will dry and die which will need an operation to correct and remove part of her bowl if it is caught quick enough it can some times be re positioned inside the body with little ill effects i would say if it has been a week then it is unlikely to be able to be repositioned and there for surgery will be required and you are lucky you won't be charged with animal abuse  Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Guinea pig Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Volleyball Ravi Shastri Sant Thakar Singh Aerial (dance move) Stomach cancer Decompression sickness Cricket Casting Atrial septal defect Super Bowl XXVII Urinary incontinence Laws of cricket Jennifer Lopez Fecal incontinence Fancy rat Fast bowling Social rule Prostate cancer Quizbowl Chronic fatigue syndrome Cat Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 New York Giants Anthrax Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Dairy Scientology beliefs and practices Radiation poisoning Coeliac disease Traumatic brain injury Animal Escherichia coli O157:H7 Breech birth Pneumonia Insulin Magical thinking Mitral valve prolapse Diarrhea Botulism Ferret Stroke Toilet humour Folic acid The Ashes Penis Mad Money Super Bowl XXV The Apprentice 2 Super Bowl XXXIV Abortion debate Expert system Glossary of American football Game show Jon Secada Value added tax Gwen Stefani Japanese tea ceremony Batting (cricket) Legends of the Hidden Temple Rabies Aortic dissection Violin Hyakujuu Sentai GaoRanger Glossary of partner dance terms Four square Chernobyl accident EastEnders English cricket team Abstraction (computer science) Transsexuality Time Out of Mind Cancer Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 The Sims 2 Breast cancer Adjustable gastric band The Ashlee Simpson Show Drug test The Time Machine Traumatic incident reduction Traditional Chinese medicine Strap-on dildo Kodocha Rocky Mountain spotted fever Blonde on Blonde Kenny McCormick Biological warfare Cleveland Browns Max Martin Chiropractic Have I Got News For You Syringomyelia West Indian cricket team Skateboarding trick Psoriasis Columbine High School massacre

incomplete shed how to remove retained eye caps on ball python today i bought an additional thermometer and a humidity gauge so there is a therm on each end of my gallon tank is it ok to have a heat pad with a hide box above it and then a clamp lamp in the same end of the tank but opposite side i want to create more of a warm cool temp gradient on the opp end i now have her water soaking dish various shrubbery she got rid of all her shed except the eye caps she ate a mouse today but i know the eye caps need off i sprayed a special shed spray on her from my store that is for the eye caps to loosen them i'm going to see if they come off by themself but if not tomorrow i am planning on manually removing them i have heard numerous ways of achieving this tape by hand what's the best technique i've never done it before and my reptile specialist work isnt in till thursday so i was hoping i could do it myself before then any help would be much appreciated i got this off a website and it looks like a great way to get off retained eye caps retained eyecaps are a common occurrence in ball pythons but may occur in any snake problems with shedding incomplete patchy delayed are due to environmental problems too hot too cold too dry and health problems systemic bacterial or parasitic infections if a bad shed or retained eyecaps happen for more than one shed on newly acquired snakes or at all with established snakes you will need to evaluate your environment and if that is set up properly get your snake to a reptile vet soak the snake in a warm bath for minutes remove from bath and dab mineral oil available from drug or grocery store on each eye with a cotton tipped swab return snake to tank the retained shed should come off within hours if it doesn't wrap your four fingers with scotch type tape sticky side out gentlygentlygently touch the tape to the eye and rock the tape across the eye from nose to neck if this doesn't work wait until the next shed then the day that the eyes clear from being opaque soak the snake in a warm bath return to enclosure when the snake starts working on loosening and removing the head shed get in there and assist gently working the shed back over each of the eyes keeping the shed moist to make sure both eyecaps are removed do not use forceps tweezers or other sharp hard pointed objects to try to remove the shed from the eye dented eyes are common in snakes that are dehydrated or who have previously retained eye sheds thus the eyecap may appear to be still on the eye when it fact it was shed off always check the sheds to see if the eyecaps have in fact shed if you are unable to easily get the shed off get the snake to an experienced reptile vet injuries can occur all too easily due to forcible removal and infections can develop under the retained shed these are not treatable at home they must be examined by a reptile vet  Dairy Snake First aid Common cold Hamster Dialysis Textile manufacturing Urinary incontinence Herpes simplex virus Diseases of the honeybee Tofu Cat Naruto jutsu Pneumonia Solar power Spark plug Menstrual cup Thermal power station Domestic rabbit Prostate cancer Cannabis cultivation Manicure Fire fighting Chicken Reptile Agar plate Fancy rat Upholstery Thermoregulation Water Conjunctivitis Shaggy dog story Violin Malaria Mercury Atlas 6 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Volleyball Carnivorous plant Drowning Drill bit Mattress Guinea pig STS-114 Pet skunk Temperature Foodborne illness Sauna Caving Electrical wiring Diving Aerial (dance move) Fecal incontinence Leaf Avalanche Items in the Metroid series Professional wrestling match types Traumatic brain injury Hyperthermia Computer virus Floppy disk Eczema Carbon dioxide Infantilism Characters of Naruto Traumatic incident reduction Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Food preservation Glossary of firefighting equipment Visual Basic Cytomegalovirus Electrophysiology Halitosis Operation Market Garden Balance disorder Escherichia coli O157:H7 Craps Welding Printed circuit board Mouse (computing) STS-61 Snake charming Poker jargon Menstrual cycle Camp Lazlo Knife Body piercing Massage Tobacco Cheese Garfield Breastfeeding Cigar Coffee Soldering

now my turtle just barfed up some worms i fed him did i overfeed him jule c many turtles eat worms heck many creatures eat worms anyway depending on the worms' sizes you may have overfed the turtle like humans after eating something you may have to wait for five or so minutes to actually see if your still hungry and not overeat that probably is what happened to your turtle or maybe stress related problems caused it  Animal Obesity Earthworm Hypoglycemia Sandworm (Dune) Nutrition Insulin Ecology of Hong Kong Toilet humour Sea turtle Trichinosis Creatures in Bionicle Hedgehog Leatherback Sea Turtle Elephant Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze Nile crocodile Lisa the Vegetarian Race X GunBound Vermicompost Cat Heartworm Reptile Roundworm Senescence Turtle Comparisons within Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Orca Myxobolus cerebralis Koopa Troopa Timeline of notable computer viruses and worms Bloat Foie gras Livestock Snake Snail Monster Rancher monsters Binge eating disorder Taboo food and drink Egg (food) Jumpstart 3rd Grade Coprophagia Guinness Book of Records Logo programming language Acorn Ecco the Dolphin Kitten Shredder (TMNT) Tooth Bird strike Wendigo Stomach cancer Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Chicken Coconut crab Finding Nemo Hell Abenaki mythology Brown Bear Famine 613 mitzvot Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri Eating disorder Meat Acorn worm Kashrut Hematophagy Little Shop of Horrors Fecal incontinence Honeybee Blue Whale Garfield Overeaters Anonymous Fauna of Australia Hungry ghost Super Size Me Shrimp farm Light pollution Raw food diet Pet skunk Buffer overflow Heretics of Dune Diphyllobothriasis Baylisascaris Vegetarianism Great White Shark Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Anorexia nervosa Lycanthropy American Alligator Spaceballs Futurama (TV series - season 5) Digenea Sea-Monkey Tarantula Green Sea Turtle Skunk Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins The dozens

i found a bearded dragon outside while babysitting i found a bearded dragon basking in the sun on their concrete sidewalk eventually caught it and brought it home i've researched via internet what they're supposed to eat and everything but i was wondering could you identify what type of beardie it is http i photobucket com albums n iloveaustinf rnadom gardenbeardievids jpg http i photobucket com albums n iloveaustinf rnadom gardenbeardievids jpg is it too thin if it's possible to tell does it look healthy what should i watch out for and has this happened to anyone else lol it's inches long and also i read in a bearded dragon book that you could put one end of the cage in a window and the other in a shadier part and it would do the part of a heat lamp plus have uvb rays has anyone done this i live in fl he's definitely not native lol looks like a pogona vitticeps in a citrus flame color morph he's definitely way too skinny and the window thing would be nice and it would save money but uv rays can't pass through glass so he would get the heat but not the uv rays if it got hot enough then you might be able to use your window for your main source of heat but i would recommend getting a repti sun currently the best for uv requirements the repti sun is good too you knew what kind of lizard it was so i'm assuming you're not completely new to beardies here is a good website though http pets groups yahoo com group pogona it's a yahoo group for beardie owners and it has breeders on there too so they are awesome at answering any questions you have and you can learn a lot just by looking at their previous posts it doesn't look healthy but i think that's just because it's too thin and i'm not too sure you can tell if it's healthy just by looking at it if it's active and alert then those are good signs but a vet would probably be your best bet our reptile vet here ohio only costs for a general exam so i don't think that's too bad to answer your last question wow nope i don't think i've ever found a beardie in the wild although i have known people here locally to find iguanas and large pet snakes in dumpsters where people just didn't want them or couldn't take care of them any more and literally just threw them out good luck i hope you can get this guy fattened up if you want to check out my profile and look at my previous answer it's got a lot of beardie info in it that you might find useful poor guy he looks just like my youngest but skinny mine are pigs oh i just realized how big he is at his or her size pinkies are ok especially for beardies that need some extra weight you can get them from the pet store you will want a mouse pinkie they are smaller than rat pinkies i've also read that some worms are more fattening than others pinkies are supposed to be an occasional treat because they are super fattening but yours looks like it could use some fat so i would give him one once to twice a week mine get them once a month and you can get them frozen so you just let them thaw and then give them to the beardie if you don't have the heart to give them live pinkies and it's definitely old enough to be sexed http www repticzone com articles sexingbeardeddragons html if it's a female is it possible that she may have just laid a clutch of eggs this would account for her being so skinny just a thought edit i was just reading your first answer and they said no water but i read another answer that says your beardie looks a little dehydrated and i would be more inclined to lean that way my beardies get sprayed with warm water and they get soaks in the sink so they can stay hydrated i would definitely soak him in the sink or tub a little he was right about the fireflies though i've read stories of beardies eating fireflies and being dead a half hour later they have a steroid in them that is the equivalent of heart meds and it stops their heart when they eat them also i said that maybe using the window for your main source of heat was ok i guess i should have also added to that as long as you are measuring the temp of the cage and he has an area to escape the direct heat if he needs to i just kinda thought that was a common sense thing that i didn't need to add  Bearded Dragon Guinea pig Theory of conduct Piccolo Junior Saga Chicken Domestic rabbit Fancy rat Solar power Pet skunk Garfield Shaggy dog

red eared slider turtle feeding questions i have two questions about feeding my two red eared sliders first can you feed your turtles in a different pattern i know that usually you should feed them a lot of food every two to three days but would it be better to just feed them a little bit a few times a day or about half as much once a day just wondering my second question is what brand of pelleted turtle food do you think is best also is a mostly vegetarian diet ok for red eared sliders i do feed them a little cooked chicken and beef but i don't eat a lot of meat and my mom does not buy a lot of it so we don't usually have a lot of it also they foul the water really fast i mostly feed them lots of different kinds of lettuce and fruits and vegetables lastly will the turtles eat outside the water in a seperate box thanks they are fully grown and adults i can't feed them in a seperate tank because i don't have one but i clean out the water when it gets dirty and i have a powerful filter it doesn't matter if you feed them in a pattern they will know when it's feeding time i would feed them a little bit everyday my turtle loves the hbh turtle bites if they're adults a mostly vegetarian diet is fine but a little meat won't hurt they cannot eat outside of the water they need the water to swallow their food they might be too nervous to eat outside of their tank hope this helps good luck  Hamburger Guinea pig Vegetarianism Domestic rabbit Chicken Food Peruvian cuisine Egg (food) Tofu Japanese cuisine Chili con carne Kashrut Dieting Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler McDonald's Hot dog Cuisine of the Southern United States Korean cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Hamster Escherichia coli O157:H7 Bengali cuisine Cat Tooth French cuisine Jewish cuisine Raw food diet Factory farming Fasting Dim sum Meat Vegetarianism and religion Ramen Shrimp farm Breastfeeding Fecal incontinence Cuisine of Vietnam MRE Sea-Monkey Taboo food and drink Maize Cuisine of Malaysia Livestock Breakfast Fish and chips Cajun cuisine Pork Rocko's Modern Life Omega-3 fatty acid Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Chinese cuisine Domesticated turkey Dumpling W.I.T.C.H.

my iguana will not eat veggies only fruit what sould i do i can only get it to eat grapes and kewi the person i bought it from had all of them eating veggies now it will not eat them mix the greens with the fruit tearing them into small pieces may help slowly increase the greens and reduce the fruit a fruit only diet does not provide the nutritional needs of an iguana diet iguanas are herbivores they do not eat animal protein of any kind commercially available iguana food is not suitable for use as it usually contains animal protein an iguana's primary diet should include collard greens mustard greens dandelion greens escarole green beans parsnip winter squash alfalfa strawberries mangos figs cantaloupe and a calcium supplement the greens should make up the majority of the diet the iguana should be feed early every morning additional feedings may be made later if the iguana eats them water should be provided preferably in a dish too small for the iguanas to immerse themselves in size iguanas can grow to foot in length age head to vent total length just hatched in in months in in months in in year in in months in in years in in years in in years in in years in in years in in years up to in up to in housing where x is the length of the iguana housing should be x tall x deep and x long iguanas are arboreal and need to have something to climb on a bathing area is also desirable iguanas instinctually poop in water and they are likely to consistently use the bathing are to do so heat iguanas need a basking area normally at the top of the climbing area that has a temperature of f the lower areas of the cages should be cooler as a lizard regulates his body temperature by moving to warmer or cooler areas the lowest temperature nighttime should not be less than f nighttime heat can be provided using ceramic heaters or night bulbs never use heat rocks with iguanas as they can cause burning light iguanas live in equatorial areas they should have hours of light and hours of dark they also require high quality uvb lights such as reptisun to facilitate vitamin d production to allow calcium absorption vitamin d drop are not a suitable replacement due to problems with dosing and lack of evidence on their effectiveness daily trips outside in a suitable enclosure are desirable when temperature permits handling iguanas must be handled daily to socializing them as they can inflict injury with their tails teeth and claws the purchase of protective gear for the forearms is often considered my son uses a leather jacket and gloves they are not domesticated animals so this behavior is instinctual on the iguana's part the daily handling is to show them that you are a friend rather than a threat never punish an iguana but at the same time do not let them win if the iguana learns that tail thrashing will cause you to put them down they will always tail thrash when you try to pick them up health iguanas require reptile vets regular vets do not have the training needed to understand what is happening in an iguana or any other reptile you can find a list of reptile vets in the us at http www anapsid org vets index html lifespan in captivity iguanas given proper care can be expected to live years please be sure to visit anapsid org it is the website of melissa kaplan author of iguanas for dummies http www anapsid org iguana index html http pets groups yahoo com group babyiguana http pets groups yahoo com group iguanaden http stembol com pets iguanacage htm  Vegetarianism Vitamin C Veganism Nutrition Tuatara Tooth Dinosaur Tocopherol Folic acid Pet skunk Autonomous building Solar power Organic food Dog Biodiesel Chicken Raw food diet Agriculture Equine conformation Livestock Healthy eating Protein Coffee Soybean Reptile Coconut crab Peanut Thermal power station Food Vitamin D Welding Dieting Dietary fiber Cheese Tooth enamel Glass Gas metal arc welding Vegetarian nutrition Nile crocodile Yoghurt American Alligator Swimming Shark Antioxidant Bearded Dragon Antarctic krill Tetrapod Koala Omega-3 fatty acid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Casting Atkins Nutritional Approach Thermoregulation Coeliac disease Goldfish Drill bit Carburetor Chocolate Domestication Motor oil Capercaillie Alzheimer's disease Alcohol fuel Ceramics Mango Chronic fatigue syndrome Kosher foods Anorexia nervosa Fasting Lizard Organic farming Solar variation Platypus Tank Green Iguana Honeybee Elephant Cuisine of the Southern United States Gal__pagos Islands Egg (food) Potato Prostate cancer Leatherback Sea Turtle Explosive material Climate of the United Kingdom Brown Bear Diving suit

whats the best snake for kids as starter snakes looking for ones who are least likely to bite i would recommend a corn snake but make sure you know the source many pet stores don't properly verify their breaders or the incoming pets petco is the only one i know that hires decent staff and even they are hit and miss depending on the management ball pythons are great temperments but all pythons require strict heat and humidity monitoring that they aren't good first pets if it's too dry they don't shed properly and get infections too cool and wet they get pneumonia either way they usually are killed within the first year due to neglect king snakes can also be good but occassionally stop taking mice and need to be force fed since their wild diet is moer reptiles garters are bad as the captive bred species can't be handled without a high risk of broken bones ruptured lungs  Cat Snake Domestic rabbit Hamster First aid Chicken Fancy rat Dog Guinea pig Reptile Burmese python Tuberculosis Snake charming Teen Girl Squad Livestock Garter snake Pet skunk Bird Milk Hedgehog Domestication Vitamin C Taboo food and drink Equine conformation Swimming Shrimp farm Prostate cancer Carnivorous plant Reticulated Python Zoo Tarantula Shaggy dog story Tasmanian Devil Pet Domestic goat Breastfeeding Ball python Cystic fibrosis Wheat Thermal power station Rat Tobacco smoking Lung cancer Babe Ruth Creatures in Bionicle Chinchilla Anopheles Goanna Legionellosis Password cracking Rattlesnake Pneumonia Baseball Mosquito RuneScape quests Bird migration Caving Bearded Dragon Knife Ferret Stroke Elephant Pet store Fugu Malaria Carnivore Neopets Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Colorectal cancer Paleocene Traumatic brain injury Textile manufacturing Chagas disease Falconry Nile crocodile Dairy Garlic Cereal Abortion Herpes simplex virus Python Common cold Cocaine Cancer Feral cat Nutrition Weight training In The Groove (game) Atkins Nutritional Approach Scientology beliefs and practices Diving Mountain Gorilla Axolotl Tyrannosaurus rex Cheese Dinosaur

my baby bearded dragon is not eating i just got my baby bearded dragon yesterday from petsmart they said that they only feed them canned crickets so we bought them and hes not getting we also gave him some veggies and fruit he has a watt spot light on him all day and then at night he has a watt one of those redlights just so you know he has water and i dont think hes drinking that he is moving around and laying by the light but i dont know what to do i agree with the last answer petsmart or any petstore in my experience doesn't know enough to give good solid information on any particular animal they can keep them alive long enough to get them sold but for solid advice on keeping your pet alive you need to look else where ok that being said i agree with your last answer i'll add to that though that since you have a baby you might want to put him in a smaller enclosure when feeding the live crickets so that he can catch them easier and if he has trouble catching them i've heard that if you put the bag of crickets in the freezer for a minute it stuns them so they can't move as fast and your baby can catch them easier you need what is called pinhead crickets they are ity bity and when you get them you will need to put them in a baggy and add a little bit of calcuim powder to dust them with think shak n bake you can't leave the un eaten crickets in with your beardie or they will nibble at his toes when they start getting hungry i'm also assuming that petsmart didn't tell you that beardie's are at an increased risk for metabolic bone disease kinda like osteoprosis this is why they need there food dusted with calcuim powder you can find it in with the reptile supplies at the pet store it will be with the vitamins which i use as well after they get older and they don't have the proper lighting or calcuim supplements then they get the bone disease and their bones literally start breaking and your beardie can become paralyzed and mean he's in pain you can't blame them for not wanting to be messed with it's not pretty though what else can i say that petsmart probably didn't oh don't use sand at least not until they are adults their digestive system can't digest in and it gets caught inside them and kills them it's called impactation they make special calci sand that is supposed to be digestable but it's not if your beardie were to just eat a little of the calci sand it would pass through but since it's made out of calcuim most beardies will tend to eat large quantities of it and this makes it even more dangerous than regular play sand i personally don't use any type of sand for my beardies and they are adults but the only time i've heard of it being ok is if they are adults and you use play sand not calci sand um the basking spot temp should measure degrees and use a digitle thermometer the stick ons are off by as much as degrees either way back to your original question though mine are adults and don't drink their water some beardies love water and others don't just make sure that his food is misted or mist him even better if you let him swim around in your sink every once in a while water up to his shoulders make sure he can touch the bottom and water kinda warm but don't burn him then he will soak the water up through his vent and this will keep him from getting de hydrated i've heard that some beardies will eat baby food good not that i would suggest this as a main diet but if all else fails and he absoulutly refuses to eat anything then this might get him some nutrients try getting some mustard greens this is the closest we have in the us to what they eat in the wild when they are first born and they tend to like the taste of it better than other greens and some other veggies and putting them in a food processor with a drop or two of water and then see if he'll eat that as a baby he probably wont be too interested in his vegetables though it will want the live crickets i'm not even sure the canned ones are small enough for babies you never want what you are feeding him to be bigger than the space between his eyes here is a good yahoo group for beardie owners http pets groups yahoo com group pogona it is a site that has beardie breeders and owners on there and they give awesome advice you could join and then scan through their previous messages to get more advice or you could post a question in there but they are great at helping you out best of luck with your beardie i think my husband just went outside to catch a locust for ours good luck with your baby and i'm sorry i wrote a novel  Hamster

what's the best kind of snake for a pet i want a snake nothing that gets big really big something attractive if you have any suggestions let me know a little about the snake thanks oh best answer will be chosen i would also like something that will tolerate me holding it i like handling snakes what do you guys think about a california kingsnake i have owned a ball python they make really good pets because they don't get too large and by nature they are very docile shy snakes they are not aggressive unless scared injured or provoked in some way as long as you handle them from the time they are babies they are very gentle snakes and make terrific pets the only downfall to a ball python is that you need uv light heaters and humidity for them as they are a tropical snake i now own an amelonistic corn snake almost but not quite albino and he is also a terrific pet very low maintenance just a light over his tank fresh water and a regular supply of mice i breed my own after what happened to my ball python corn snakes do not get very large either mine is almost years old and he is about feet long but only about to inches in diameter another great snake for a pet is a california king snake but now you are talking about a fairly large snake when full grown they can reach feet in length and about inches in diameter when they are mature but they are also a very gentle snake and easy to keep as a pet i know because this is the next snake i am getting and have researched them either of these types of snake makes a great pet but be sure you are ready for the responsibility of owning a snake and make sure it is legal in some areas it is not legal to own any type of pet snakes whichever you choose be sure to read up on how to care for it properly and also know this cedar wood bedding is toxic to all reptiles even if the mice you feed your snake are bedded on cedar chips it will kill your snake i know this from first hand experience as the lady who owned the local pet shop did not know that cedar is toxic to reptiles so that is what she used for bedding for her mice and rats but did not tell anyone who bought feeder mice and rats from her long story short my ball python and other pet snakes in my town died from being fed mice and rats that were bought from this lady's pet shop what happened to her we all got together and are suing her and she went out of business  Shaggy dog story Tarantula Fancy rat Snake Guinea pig Burmese python Domestic rabbit House Mouse Shotgun Rat Brown Rat Dog Billiards Cat Pet store Ball python Mouse (computing) Fast bowling Snake charming Tetrapod Creatures in Bionicle Mattress Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Pet Rod Stewart Goldfish Ferret Breastfeeding Animal testing Maize Zoo EastEnders Fish farming Chicken Nuclear power Irrigation Platypus Alcohol fuel Mickey Mouse Aquarium Thermal power station Shark Terminal ballistics Minor Harry Potter Beasts Reptile Falconry Plastic Opportunity rover Pet skunk Whip Solar power RuneScape quests Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Poker jargon Fauna of Australia Milton H.
