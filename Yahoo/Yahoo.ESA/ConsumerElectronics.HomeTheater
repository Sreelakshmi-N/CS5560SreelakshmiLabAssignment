can i use older speaker cable i own a pair of ft long gauge speaker cables that have oxidized so the insulation while clear several years ago has turned green since they haven't been used in quite some time are these cables still serviceable thanks for any advice hi james i would replace them with new cables to maintain the audio signal from the power amplifier as i feel the old ones may deteriorate the signal good speaker cable is reasonably priced and i would replace them every couple of years because contamination is not always visible  Audiophile Coaxial cable Oscilloscope Transformer Cable television Optical fiber Apollo Command/Service Module Audio system measurements Transistor Electronic amplifier Loudspeaker Rail terminology Circuit design Motorcycle TGV Action potential Car audio Xbox Vacuum tube Railway signalling William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin Impedance matching DVD XLR connector Amplifier D-subminiature IPod Bluetooth MOSFET Electrical wiring Subwoofer AM broadcasting Static inverter plant Mattress SCART Category 5 cable Diode Gas tungsten arc welding Radar Glass Phonograph Capacitor Submarine communications cable High-voltage direct current Bicycle brake systems Universal Serial Bus Repeater RCA connector Ethernet Jack plug Power Mac G4 Cube Satellite television Kenwood Electronics Sound reinforcement system Media in Canada Broadband Internet access Home Box Office Digital television Electronics Traffic light Wi-Fi Digital audio Electrophysiology Mixing console Spark plug Light-emitting diode Twisted pair DIN connector Nintendo GameCube Television The Ark in Space Audio crossover Resistor Corrosion Radio Digital Subscriber Line High fidelity Long Island Sound Input impedance Power cable Musical Instrument Digital Interface Decibel Mediumwave Modem Royal Assent Headphones Polar Bear Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Magnetic cartridge Phantom power NTSC Transatlantic telegraph cable Speaker of the British House of Commons FM broadcasting Echo chamber Nuclear reactor United States House of Representatives TIA-568A/B Audio power

why do hd channels on io appear in format my tv has picture options to convert it to but when i do it it will blow the pixels up making it look like an ordinary digital channel so my question is is the aspect ratio on hd channels by design to compress the pixels more or do i have to manually adjust to fit the screen i have a inch i widescreen hdtv it's by default and the ordinary digital channels fit the screen when i fix the aspect ratio of the hd channels it makes it look out of proportion you shouldn't need to adjust your t v the program you are watching most likely was not filmed in hd most channels do not run hd programing along with commercials which are rarely broadcast in hd so that might be what you are seeing i do not know what provider you have but with cox there will be a little hd symbol next to the program name in the little menu bar and i am guessing other providers do this as well also are you using an hd input from the cable box to the tv either component or hdmi that also might be your problem if you still can't figure it out i would call the company and ask them whats up  Television Digital television Widescreen Pixel Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting DVD Aspect ratio (image) Digital photography Cable television Anamorphic widescreen ATSC Oscilloscope PlayStation Portable Laserdisc Mouse (computing) 1080p Channel 4 Movie projector MPEG-2 Nintendo DS Digital cinematography Amstrad CPC Digital cinema Xbox 360 Babylon 5 Pan and scan Transformer JPEG Video codec NTSC Digital Visual Interface SCART RGB color model Xbox Dolby Laboratories British Sky Broadcasting Apple IIGS Liquid crystal display Apple typography Enterprise content management 35 mm film DVB AppleScript MTV Loudspeaker High-Definition Multimedia Interface Computer display standard System/34 TiVo AmigaOS Super Nintendo Entertainment System Color Graphics Adapter IPod Digital video recorder Commercial broadcasting Commodore 64 Media in Canada Nintendo GameCube Satellite television BBC ITunes Palm OS MP3 EIA-708 Photography Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Stereoscopy Sound Blaster Video compression Circuit design Jet engine IBM PC compatible Macromedia Flash Screenshot Ethernet Freeview Digital image editing Teletext Frequency synthesiser System/36 Synthesizer Chroma subsampling Gramophone record Windows XP View camera H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Movie camera Digital audio broadcasting Musical Instrument Digital Interface BBC Three Field-programmable gate array ITV Halftone

whats this piece of stereo equipment when your stereo is playing music is shows bars going up and down i think their for the different frequency's like when a symbol splash's one of the bars will shoot up what is this piece of equipment and what are the benefits of having one that is an audio spectrum analysis display you are right that each bar represents a frequency range with the far left bars indicating low frequencies and the right side bars indicating high frequencies the height of the bar at any instant indicates the volume level of the frequency range represented by that bar i'm not sure what the value of having one of these in an ordinary stereo since you really can't do anything about the information it provides in professional recording the analyzer is used to make sure that no frequency exceeds maximum recording level a single lever meter vu meter will indicate overall record level but sometimes a certain frequency will overload and that may not indicate on a single vu meter display  Microphone Compact audio cassette Stereoscopy Gramophone record Transformer Oscilloscope Frequency modulation Amateur radio Digital audio broadcasting Solar cell Digital VHS High fidelity Movie projector Audiophile Sound recording Very high frequency Mixing console Sound Laserdisc Loudspeaker Subwoofer Transistor Digital audio Decibel Vowel TV-FM DX Federal Standard 1037C Sound effect FM broadcasting Citizens' band radio Multitrack recording SIGSALY Circuit design Transmitter Vacuum tube Kenwood Electronics Binaural recording Stereophonic sound NTSC Explosive material Psychoacoustics Wi-Fi Capacitor Digital-to-analog converter Bluetooth Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Sea level rise Audio level compression VHF omnidirectional range Time signature Radio International Phonetic Alphabet Radar Complex number Operational amplifier Frequency Sampler (musical instrument) Harp Digital circuit Diode Normal distribution Karaoke 8 mm video format Synthesizer Signal (information theory) Compact disc National Weather Service High-voltage direct current Super Audio CD Analog-to-digital converter Neurofeedback Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Audio mastering MIM-23 Hawk Huygens probe Ionosphere Acorn Electron Equalization Antenna (radio) Frequency spectrum Subcarrier Monochromator Permittivity Dolby Laboratories Laser Glider Big band Amplitude modulation Longwave Electronic organ Advanced Audio Coding Musical notation Rebreather Optical coherence tomography Joint (audio engineering) Amstrad CPC Audio data compression

pip sound i have bought a new tv and it has pip i was wondering while i was playing xbox and i bring up pip if i could get the sound from the small picture instead of the xbox game thanks probably not the whole point of the pip is to maintain a small corner of attention on a second program while watchnig a main program the audio will always be from the main program in order to hear the audio you'll have to switch the xbox to the pip and move the program to the main display  Computer and video games Television Gladys Knight & the Pips Musical Instrument Digital Interface Xbox Counter-Strike Video game music Dominoes Starfleet ranks and insignia Grailquest Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Game programmer Xbox Live PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 LAN party Grand Theft Auto III Sega Dice Euchre Metropolitan Police Service Subwoofer Modchip Sega Dreamcast Loudspeaker Pump It Up ZX Spectrum Pinball Apple Macintosh Karaoke Nintendo GameCube Super Nintendo Entertainment System USS Sea Devil (SS-400) Electronic Arts Acorn Electron Amstrad CPC Norman Whitfield Timeline of computing 1990-forward Atari 8-bit family DVD Halo 2 Defender (game) History of operating systems Apple II family Xbox Media Center Sound effect Dance Dance Revolution ATI Technologies Audio data compression Sega Saturn Closed captioning Need for Speed PlayStation Portable PowerPC Radio drama SoundStorm L4 microkernel family Sound Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting RAD Game Tools Pai Gow SCART Playing card I Heard It Through the Grapevine Computer role-playing game WMVP Radio clock American Broadcasting Company Dead or Alive (video game) Sound Blaster Mortal Kombat Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nintendo Entertainment System Game programming Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Madden NFL Microsoft NBC DirectX Martian Chess Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Radar Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Digital-to-analog converter Unreal Championship 2: The Liandri Conflict Wheel of Fortune ITunes Order of the Bath Rare (video game company) X86 Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne Fischer Random Chess BBC Radio 2 Cable television Mouse (computing) Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Star Wars: Republic Commando Out Run Hearing aid Dubbing (filmmaking)

i have a p dlp and i am wondering whether or not to get a hd player i have an upscaling dvd player and so far the dvds look fantastic but i was wondering if an hd dvd or blu ray player would be much of a step into the hd world over upscaling to p also if it is worth it which hd dvd or blu ray player would you recomend i had my eye on the toshiba hd a due to the price even up converted dvds carry only sdtv resolution lines and the picture quality is limited to that hd dvd and bluray players will upscale regular dvds but aren't necessarily any better than what you have you main benefit will come when you get hd or bluray dvds a well made hd dvd or bluray will provide lines of resolution down scaled from and give you much more detail in your pictures  High-definition television Blu-ray Disc DVD Laserdisc Television MPEG-2 Video Video CD Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Digital television Handheld game console Xbox 360 Camcorder H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Digital cinema Anamorphic widescreen 8 mm video format Telecine Machinima MP3 NTSC Nablus Volleyball Movie projector Manga ATSC DualDisc Super Video CD Galactic Civilizations Video codec S-VHS Stereoscopy Endgame PlayStation Portable S__CAM Karaoke Xbox Sport utility vehicle The Criterion Collection Analog-to-digital converter Ayumi Hamasaki Digital photography Pok__mon Chronicles GamePark Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX PAL Laptop Regional lockout DLP TiVo Rush (band) O scale Color depth SCART HD DVD Widescreen Plasma display Digital rights management Civilization III In The Groove (game) Game theory Blu Cantrell VHS Bish__jo game Beavis and Butt-head Run Length Limited Macrovision Screenshot Tag Dubbing (filmmaking) Major League Baseball Neiman Marcus Adventure Game Studio Blockbuster Video World Poker Tour The Apprentice 2 Homestar Runner Motion picture rating system Comparison of media players DVD-Audio Videocassette recorder Quantum Leap Invader Zim Color Eye color Airsoft CPU design 1080p Moir__ pattern Money in Harry Potter Missingno.

is it possible to clean the inside of a speaker and if so how i think it's called the drum i dunno but there's something sticky on the interior of one of my speakers for a stereo system i have and the affected speaker doesn't work so i put and together and thought that this sticky stuff is preventing the speaker from working i could be wrong and probably am but anyway how can i clean this the speaker won't come apart it's just solid wood no screws or anything something tells me that this isn't possible well i'am a professional sound engineer and am also a cretified speaker repair tech and i've seen it all let me tell you once this guy brought a pair of high end cerwin vega in the repair shop and said they don't sound right and it has a really bad oder when it's played so i hooked it up and yes one of them sounded muddy in the low range and had an oder to it so i took it apart and to all of our amazement there was a dead kitten inside the cabinet lol ok now to answer your question if the speaker smells burnt it is just that and if the sticky stuff is black it is probably that your cross over is burnt out the capasitors have melted probably due to being over driven for long periods of time either by a voltage that is too low or too high meaning that your amp is too little or too big for the speakers and the answer to if you can clean them to get them working again is no once they stop working that's it sorry but if you really like them and you can't get the same model anymore you can always have them reconed and the crossovers rebuilt by a professional in your area if you were in fla i would recomend the speaker exchange on fowler ave in tampa i used to work there a long time ago and they're good at what they do good luck  Bass guitar Loudspeaker Extreme Programming Shit Bicycle lighting Non-native pronunciations of English Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Phoebe Buffay's songs Subwoofer Singlish Poker jargon Tris Speaker Tire Social rule Electrophysiology Timpani Homer's Enemy Drag racing Wonderland (McFly album) Theory of conduct Violin Keynesian economics Heinkel He 100 Ruy Lopez Firefighter RuneScape quests Clarinet Electronic amplifier Friends Anchor Car audio Indian English Transformer Supply and demand Cruising (maritime) Piccolo Junior Saga Empire Burlesque Equine conformation Drill bit Magnet Philosophy of language Jet engine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an New Zealand English Economics Wind turbine Operational amplifier Ron and Fez God Emperor of Dune It's All Gone Pete Tong Membrane potential Incandescent light bulb Time Out of Mind Carnegie Mellon University Draw poker Bon Jovi Scientology beliefs and practices Vowel Teen Girl Squad Professional wrestling throws Ra (board game) Toyota Prius Thermal power station Glossary of climbing terms Screw Year of the Spider Good Morning, Vietnam Floppy disk Jumpstart 3rd Grade The Ashlee Simpson Show Big band Rose (Doctor Who) Audiophile Reservoir Dogs Oscilloscope Standard Cantonese Headphones Sound effect Stuttering Seismometer Chopsticks The Inside The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Snooker Speech recognition The Amber Spyglass Telephone exchange Buddy Guy Guitar The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Johnny 5 Naruto jutsu Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Doomtown Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Incarnations of Immortality Carburetor W.

stereo speakers question i'm trying to get the best speakers for my stereo receiver here are my receiver details power output stereo mode ohms thd hz khz x w total harmonic distortion ohms w khz for safe amplifier operation use the speakers with impedance of over ohms when you use only speaker a or b terminals and use the speakers with impedance of over ohms when you use both speaker a and b terminals what should i be looking for in a speaker it is a sherwood receiver model rx for this receiver you want to look for a speaker system that has a nominal impedance of ohms or higher since there are very few speaker systems that are ohms you only need to get speakers if you do get speakers only run of them at a time unless you are able to somehow find ohm speakers since your receiver is not really full range as far as the frequency response is concerned hz khz or wider is considered full range any speaker system that will play down to hz to hz in the bass frequencies will be more than sufficient to make the most out of your receiver to give you an idea many bookshelf speakers will be able to cover the frequency response of the receiver just fine on the other hand most large floorstanding speakers will not sound any deeper in the bass than a minimonitor speaker system because your speakers will only go as low as your receiver so it will not be cost effective to get a large speaker system not knowing what music you listen to at what level you listen and the size of your room i can give you a few choices that will match well with each criteria if you want a speaker that will play loud actually at db v m are the most efficient stand mount monitors on the market that i've seen and or you have a large room i e ' x ' or larger the bic acoustech ht bookshelf speakers will do quite well i own a pair if you want a speaker that is smooth sounding with clarity that is easy to listen to for most types of music the silverline audio minuet minimonitors are very small but will cover your receiver's frequency range and is one of the most easy speakers to drive because of its extremely stable impedance this is a high end speaker system meaning it is capable of the highest quality of sound for its size using premium quality components the price will be relatively higher than your typical consumer electronics speakers i've auditioned these impressive little gems if you want a floorstanding speaker system so you won't have to put the speakers on stands or on something else that sounds very good with most music and not cost an arm and a leg is the athena as f i hope this at the very least puts you on the right road to finding musical and channel home theater bliss  Electronic amplifier Microphone Impedance matching Transformer Operational amplifier Electrophysiology Subwoofer Bass guitar High fidelity Circuit design Decibel Antenna (radio) MP3 Oscilloscope Audio system measurements Transistor Gramophone record Sound Blaster Resistor Laserdisc Digital-to-analog converter Bose Corporation Super Audio CD Low-pass filter Stereoscopy Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Music radio Digital audio broadcasting Audio crossover Kenwood Electronics Impedance Mixing console Compact disc Stereophonic sound Magnetic cartridge Voltage source Amstrad CPC Input impedance Analog-to-digital converter Advanced Audio Coding Solar cell Capacitor Federal Standard 1037C Bicycle lighting Headphones Wind turbine Phase-locked loop Sega CD Sound recording Radio controlled airplane Frequency synthesiser Phonograph KEF Double bass Atari ST Harmonica Inflation Amateur radio Movie projector High-definition television RISC Computer Surround sound Electronic organ Car audio Speech recognition RC circuit Laser Acorn Electron Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster 8 mm video format HD Radio Radio Coaxial cable Jack plug IBM PC compatible Modem Vorbis Vacuum tube Output impedance Switched-mode power supply Corporate governance Flute Digital photography CPU design Home cinema Gas metal arc welding

how do i connect my ps to my surround sound system there's a couple of different answers to your question based on what kind of sound system you have because the ps has multiple ways of delivering sound i'll cover the most common here and you can choose one that best fits your setup and your configuration preferences the first is hdmi which can carry both a high def video and digital audio signal to do this your receiver needs to have at least a hdmi input and your ps has to be configured in the options settings to send audio and video through the hdmi cable if your tv does not have hdmi but your receiver does or if your receiver has hdmi input but not output then hopefully your receiver has component output which you would then connect to your tv most tvs today have at least component inputs if your receiver does not have hdmi but your tv does and your receiver has a tos link otherwise known as optical audio input then you can connect the hdmi to the tv the optical to your receiver and specify in your configuration settings that you want the hdmi to carry video only and the audio to be on the digital optical output if your receiver has a tos link input and component video inputs outputs then you can connect the ps directly to your receiver using the optical for audio and the component for video then have component out from your receiver to your tv you would want to do this if you have multiple video sources going to your receiver and want to use your receiver as a video selector without having to change the video source on the tv constantly if your tv has digital output at all be it optical coaxial or hdmi and your receiver has a matching input then you can connect the ps to your tv and then connect the audio to your ps be aware however that though the audio may pass through the tv the audio signal may lose the encoding of surround sound if that feature pass through is not supported by your tv  DVD SCART Television Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting High-Definition Multimedia Interface Home cinema RCA connector Modem Laserdisc High-definition television Input impedance Transformer Bluetooth Oscilloscope Loudspeaker Impedance matching Digital Visual Interface Operational amplifier Digital Central processing unit Dolby Laboratories Ethernet Original Amiga chipset Nintendo GameCube Enterprise content management Synthesizer Digital audio workstation Electronic amplifier Digital circuit GSM services Xbox 360 Camcorder Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sound Blaster Xbox PlayStation Portable Coaxial cable Analog-to-digital converter Audio level compression Mouse (computing) Phase-locked loop AES/EBU Dolby Digital Universal Serial Bus Musical Instrument Digital Interface Vorbis Circuit design Atari ST Atari 8-bit family NTSC Cable television Asynchronous Transfer Mode PC Engine Satellite television Decibel Computer Nominal impedance Lossless data compression MP3 Video codec Movie projector Audiophile Repeater Transistor Optical fiber Surround sound Digital audio FireWire Jack plug Amstrad CPC Sound card Radio S/PDIF Gramophone record Common Unix Printing System Data compression Federal Standard 1037C ITU-T Blu-ray Disc Super Nintendo Entertainment System Sound reinforcement system IPod Logic gate High-voltage direct current ITunes Bicycle lighting

can someone tell me what a blu ray disc is how is it different from a dvd the difference between a dvd hdvd cd and blue rays are merely technical it is all about the laser and how the information is stored and maybe the material used to make the disk a dvd uses a red laser a blu ray uses a blue laser the blue laser is at least half the size of the red laser meaning that you can stored double the information or more in the same space the difference is like using a crayon and a color pencil you can color a more detail picture with the color pencil because the tip is smaller there might be other difference in the way the information is written to the disk but i'm not sure remember that most of us do not need to know all the details to use the product only people that build the product or products that are going to use the blu ray need to know the exact nature of the beast what the average user need to know are things is that the more information you can squezed into an area the better a picture or movie may look remember that the fact that you saved a picture or movie to a blu ray will not improve it what it will do is that you can put more information in it so the level of detail can be better is like saving a picture in high resolution the higher the resolution the more details you can see especially when you zoom into it the drawback is the size of the file so people compromise by getting a picture that is good enough as opposed to the best quality posible the other thing to know is that devices have to be made to handle this new format you cannot play a blu ray movie or an hdvd on a regular dvd because the device or dvd player was not built for this in mind one final thing to note is price and availability of the product there is a big competition between the blu ray and the hdvd i think the blu ray has more capacity but it is more propietary that is people have to buy the rights to use it from sony so you can buy one or the other but you may end up with useless equipment if the technology you chose did not win in the end  Blu-ray Disc DVD Laserdisc Compact disc Floppy disk Digital photography High-definition television Digital rights management Redundant array of independent disks Gramophone record Television Camcorder Laser 8 mm video format MiniDisc DualDisc Handheld game console Mouse (computing) Sega Dreamcast Enterprise content management CPU cache MP3 Movie projector Video codec Color Apple II family Machinima Hard disk IPod GunBound USB flash drive Nintendo 64 Disk image Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Atari 8-bit family PlayStation 3 Copy protection Raster graphics Videocassette recorder NTSC Compact audio cassette Anamorphic widescreen Karaoke Walkman File Allocation Table Gamut ITunes Music Store Video game music Audiophile Volleyball CPU design Windows XP Surveillance JPEG Final Fantasy (video game) CD-R Computer Pixel Warez Digital cinema Windows Vista Modchip PlayStation 2 Virtual memory Amstrad CPC Widescreen Plasma display S-VHS Photography Windows 2000 Ebook DVD-R File sharing Nintendo H.264/MPEG-4 AVC View camera PNG ITunes Digital image editing R-Type TiVo Binary prefix NTFS System 7 (Macintosh) Solarquest Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Topps Motion picture rating system

is non pressed paper cone for a speaker good or bad that depends entirely on what you are intending to use it for typically non pressed paper is known to have a better sound to it it makes voices sound better but the downside is that it doesn't last as long as some of the other materials that they use to make speakers the materials that i like the best both for sound quality and longevity for cones are polypropylene and aluminum rubber surround material in my opinion is the best as it does not wear out with time whatsoever it will definitely sound good but because paper weighs more than the other materials woofers especially end up having more of a dull thwonk sound to the bass instead of a sharp thud if you were to go to any major electronics store and demo subs from multiple price ranges you should be able to understand what i am talking about  Loudspeaker Subwoofer Gramophone record Saxophone Bass guitar Magnet Violin Terminal ballistics Plastic Welding Non-native pronunciations of English Electronic organ Strap-on dildo Polypropylene Knife Trombone Antenna (radio) Sound recording MP3 Solar cell Laserdisc Color Authentic performance Pottery Diving suit Timpani Gas metal arc welding Audio crossover Hearing aid DVD Audiophile Publishing Drawing Phoneme Bicycle lighting Atari 8-bit family Hearing impairment Stage lighting Minor Discworld concepts Radar Mattress Drill bit Pinophyta Shit Musical Instrument Digital Interface Phonograph Modem Typewriter Klipsch Time Out of Mind Piano Guitar Harmonica Finnish language KEF Digital photography Printed circuit board Bong Crass Spark plug Chinese language Speech recognition Tweeter Computer Pet Sounds Harp Morse Code IBM PC compatible Electrostatic loudspeaker CPU design Friction High fidelity Vowel Caving Drum and bass CPU cache Pine ZX Spectrum Speech synthesis Vulcanization Weezer Sound Blaster Pipe organ Tamil language Tire Sperm Whale Casting Therion (band) Gas tungsten arc welding Xbox 360 Clothing Rope Capitalism Planetary nebula Traditional animation Upholstery Money Surround sound Logic

whats a good tv projector for under and is good for gamming and has built in speakers and if you know any stores that have it please tell me thanks there are some projectors in that price range but to be honest none of them are good for tv or gaming here's why most of the projectors in that range are built for one specific purpose and that is to display static images for presentations similar to a computer monitor there is little to no attention paid to the overall picture quality contrast ratio aspect ratio even hookups because the only thing they typically display is spreadsheets and graphs the fans in these units are generally very noisy thus making them inappropriate for a theaer like environment and they are really not meant to be used for extended amounts of time also in this price range you can forget about having support for hd which is yet another reason these those projectors are available at such a low cost for a real projector or at least one that will give you the quality presentation that you should be looking for in a projector that you will use for serious movie watching and game playing i suggest looking for a projector that is made specifically for home theater use expect projectors of this caliber to start around i highly recommend the panasonic pt ax u it retails for and has a native x display and supports hd sources it may sound more expensive than you're wanting to spend but i guarantee you'll be much happier with the performance of the unit in the long run if is too much take a look at some of panasonic's older models you can probably still find them online refurbished or used like the pt ae u or the pt ae u both of these units perform very well also and could probably be had for closer to or much less any projector you purchase will usually have one built in speaker but it won't have more than watts going to it projectors are really supposed to be display devices only meaning i would never recommend using them for true speaker amplifier replacements also i would suggest not slouching on the screen either most people overlook the importance of the screen but it can truely make or break a projectors picture quality i know it's a lot of info but i hope it helps you make an informed buying decision  Digital photography Microeconomics Loudspeaker Motion picture rating system Computer Economics High-definition television Atari 8-bit family Anamorphic widescreen Supply and demand IBM PC compatible Amstrad CPC Television Management information system Insurance Sound Blaster MP3 Projection screen Atari ST Gramophone record Inflation Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Gamut Home cinema Movie theater Widescreen Mutual fund Gross domestic product Laptop 35 mm film Transformer FairTax IMAX Solar cell Atari 2600 Tax Xbox 360 Photography Hard disk Embedded system Audiophile A Course In Miracles Surveillance Commodore International MMORPG Cinerama Light-emitting diode Nintendo Revolution High fidelity Slot machine Commodore 64 Digital projector Bicycle lighting Internet fraud Video Windows Vista Neopets Opportunity cost Laserdisc PlayStation 3 Personal computer Outsourcing Labor theory of value Capitalism Electronic amplifier ZX Spectrum NTSC Operational amplifier Amiga SCART Decibel Film Transistor ITunes Portable Document Format Computer and video games Library (computer science) Bluetooth Subwoofer Demoscene Expert system Final Fantasy XI Windows 2000 Magnetic resonance imaging Consensus decision-making Circuit design Nintendo DS Sonar Pixel PLATO NeXT

what's better an lcd flat screen or a projector i want the image as big as possible it will probably be used hours a day max or longer for the occasional party to play music videos etc i've already got a speaker set up and a blank wall in case i get a projector but i hear the bulbs have to be replaced a lot do you projector owners mind this and do you think its worth the extra money to have such a big image i have both the projector in the home theater for the occasional use the flat screen is in our family room there are trade offs the lcd screen is going to give you a great image in ambient light as well as low light but the image is fixed at or or whatever you buy the projector can give you a image but the best image is in low light not very effective for a party the lamp will need to be changed around to hours at two hours a day well you can do the math it's not that costly on average hope this helps  Movie projector Projection screen Liquid crystal display LCD projector Screensaver Digital projector Light-emitting diode Widescreen Photography Lighting Incandescent light bulb Anamorphic widescreen Digital photography Slide projector IMAX Home cinema Nintendo DS IMac DLP Light gun Stereoscopy Film Headlight Computer animation Wheel of Fortune PowerBook Digital Visual Interface Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Game Boy Game Boy Advance Cathode ray tube Contrast ratio Universal Studios Persistence of vision Atari 8-bit family Mercury-vapor lamp Television Interactive whiteboard Gamut Cinerama TFT LCD Digital cinema DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Winning Streak Oscilloscope Color Panavision Laptop Dial M for Murder Supply and demand Monetary policy DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Warner Bros.

question about high definition tv i read a article on hd dvd's vs blu ray dvd's and it said that p doesnt exist in anything but video games at this point i'm pretty sure alot of hd and blu ray dvd's claim to be in p so how can i find out if thats true i have a toshiba dlp p that claims to be full hd just because the dvd can play at p does not mean the source it was recorded from is a source in other words the dvd itself is capable of and the player is capable of but you have no control over the source that was used to create the dvd in the first place you can even record i sd onto a p dvd but while it will play in the source is still sd you can't create resolution out of nothing and the fact is that very few sources exist for  DVD Blu-ray Disc Laserdisc High-definition television Xbox 360 VHS Computer and video games Anamorphic widescreen Apple Computer Nine Inch Nails Nablus Television Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Have I Got News For You Steam (content delivery) PlayStation 2 Cell (microprocessor) PlayStation 3 Machinima Remaster Xbox Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Copy protection Compact disc Atheism GamePark The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Texas Instruments Nintendo Revolution TiVo DualDisc Nuon UN Security Council Resolution 242 Killian documents Counter-Strike Monty Python and the Holy Grail 1080p Karaoke Fight Club Handheld game console MP3 Digital rights management Videotape MPEG-2 Anime CD-ROM HD DVD Final Fantasy XI Regional lockout DVD-RAM Camcorder New Order Holography Enterprise content management Sega Dreamcast Movie projector Babylon 5 Laptop Fair use Delta Goodrem Original Amiga chipset Pretty Good Privacy NTSC Family Feud SCART IBM PC compatible Digital cinema Survivor (TV series) Tenchi Muyo!

is onkyo the most user friendly of receivers i want to buy a receiver for around but i am not savvy when it comes to settings and all that i really just want to turn it on and have my surround but i want my sound to be free of distortion as well my friend had a yamaha and it was so confusing it almost turned me off to home theater when he was showing me how all the settings worked i need somewhere between watts per channel whatever that means it really depends on how comfortable you are with the onkyo's remote control unfortunately surround receivers are generally very confusing to setup but this can be mitigated by having your friend or a professional do the installation after that it's just a matter of learning the on off volume and switching different inputs on your remote control i would audition a few different brands sony pioneer denon and see which remote is most comfortable for you after all we are now an armchair society so the remote is really the key to becoming savvy note there are integrated remotes that allow you to press one or two buttons to do a whole series of things turn on the tv cable box dvd receiver to eliminate different remotes harmony makes some very nice remotes good luck and enjoy your new remote  Remote control Musical Instrument Digital Interface PlayStation Portable Kenwood Electronics Modem PlayStation 2 Xbox IPod Synthesizer Loudspeaker Windows XP Sound Blaster Digital audio workstation Xbox 360 High-definition television Bluetooth Home cinema Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Electric guitar Sega Dreamcast TiVo SCART DualDisc Telephone exchange Mouse (computing) Walkman MP3 Vision mixer DVD Federal Standard 1037C Photography Digital rights management X10 (industry standard) Visual Basic Home theater PC Windows Vista Transistor Internet Trademark Integrated Services Digital Network Sony Dimmer High fidelity Game controller Copy protection Mike Watt Our Gang Electronic amplifier Mattress X Window System Password Cheating in Counter-Strike Management information system Family Guy Phreaking Computer and video games Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Common Unix Printing System USB flash drive System/36 Beatmania IIDX Electricity meter Apple Macintosh Danger Hiptop Audiophile Trusted computing S__CAM Television Amstrad CPC Blood on the Tracks Telephone Oscilloscope Solar power GSM services MAME Screenshot ATI Technologies Programmable logic controller Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Effects pedal Microsoft Windows Poker jargon Palm OS Radio control Private branch exchange BlackBerry House music Transformer Set-top box MDAC Mixing console FreeBSD Global Positioning System Citizens' band radio Apple Open Collaboration Environment Floppy disk

best way to use speakers in a tiny house we have the standard speakers with a powered subwoofer great brand kenwood we've recently moved into a tiny house and i am at a loss about how best to arrange speakers so that two adjoining rooms can share sound is it possible to use the surround speakers as additional regular speakers ie left and right front how does one do that or how should i lay out the setup so that both rooms get good sound thanks you will need to check your owner's manual and see if there is a dual room room feature on your receiver this will allow you to turn two of the rear surrounds or back surrounds to stereo speakers for a second room this feature is found on some of the more expensive systems if you do have one then it will be easy to configure the surrounds for the second room you can also add a second powered subwoofer by getting a rca y splitter and hooking into the existing audio cable to the first subwoofer hope this helps email me if you need additional info  Loudspeaker Surround sound Home cinema Car audio Laserdisc IPod Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Digital Theatre System High fidelity Kenwood Electronics Bass guitar Microphone Motorcycle DVD Jack plug Stereophonic sound MP3 Electronic amplifier Universal Serial Bus Advance Wars: Dual Strike Sound Blaster Television Danger Hiptop AppleTalk Movie projector Xbox FM broadcasting SCART DVD-Audio Gramophone record Lamborghini Diablo German language Atari ST Bose Corporation Amstrad CPC Phonograph AmigaOS ATI Technologies Audio file format M16 (rifle) Table saw It's All Gone Pete Tong Redundant array of independent disks Pretty Good Privacy Dolby Laboratories Lincoln LS PC Engine Dolby Digital Dolby Pro Logic Compact audio cassette Renault 25 Nintendo DS Nintendo Entertainment System Bicycle Electronic organ Bicycle lighting Mazda Miata Mazda 323 Game Boy Dai dai shogi Mixing console Telephone exchange BMW M5 Toyota Camry Receiver (radio) Abbey Hard disk Synthesizer NTSC Vowel Karaoke Coaxial cable Mitsubishi 3000GT Mozilla Firefox Tai shogi Porsche 911 Taikyoku shogi Digital audio broadcasting Semi-trailer Teletext Traffic light Anchor Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting PHP Dutch language IBM PC compatible Impedance matching Panasonic OpenBSD De Lorean DMC-12 Toyota MR2 Emacs System 7 (Macintosh) DIN connector XERF

does anyone know why my hdmi receiver flickers when switching sources and only does pcm via hdmi it is a sony str dg it is supposed to have full hdmi switching but when i go from sat to dvd it takes about a minute for the signal to stabilize and it does not have dolby digital the reason is definitely the receiver because the components are set up correctly all hdmi switching devices have delay it is an issue with the handshake as i understand my hdmi switch takes between and secs to switch check the setting in dvd and sat it could be set to pcm for hdmi output if not your sony is not capable of dolby dts via hdmi i think o are required just run a onpical of coax digital cable between the equipment  DVD Laserdisc SCART Television Dolby Laboratories Movie projector High-Definition Multimedia Interface MP3 PlayStation 3 Blu-ray Disc Home cinema High-definition television Compact disc Telephone exchange Ethernet Super Audio CD Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting S/PDIF NTSC DVD player PlayStation Portable Federal Standard 1037C Central processing unit MiniDisc Xbox DualDisc Bluetooth MPEG-2 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Oscilloscope S__CAM Digital Visual Interface RS-232 Digital circuit Xbox 360 S-VHS Camcorder Amstrad CPC Betacam Sound recording Nintendo GameCube Universal Serial Bus Dimmer Electronic amplifier 8 mm video format 1080p Embedded system Pulse-code modulation Loudspeaker Logic gate Sony RCA connector Modem Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Compact audio cassette FireWire Digital Theatre System Synthesizer GSM services System/34 USB flash drive Sega Dreamcast PlayStation 2 Original Amiga chipset Telephone AES/EBU Advanced Technology Attachment Remote control ITU-T Audiophile Sound Blaster Satellite television Transformer Electric motor High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection NEC Corporation Computer Atari ST Modchip Global Positioning System Voice over IP Atari 8-bit family TiVo Digital video Digital rights management Star Wars: Clone Wars Photography British Sky Broadcasting High-voltage direct current Dolby Pro Logic Subwoofer CPU design Field-programmable gate array Circuit design Walkman IP Multimedia Subsystem Rail terminology

burning image to dvd this is probably a dumb question but if you burn a dvd image made from a real movie dvd with the original dvd menus etc to a blank dvd can you still watch it on a regular tv and dvd player yes but the image would have to be decrypted first if the image is from a commercial dvd such as a movie you rented from blockbuster it will have copy protection so if you don't decrypt the copy protection you will only be able to hear the sound on your back up  DVD DVD-Audio Macrovision Copy protection ITunes DeCSS Laserdisc Blockbuster Video Back to the Future Compact disc Super Audio CD PlayStation Portable FairPlay Screenshot Broken (movie) Video CD Videocassette recorder DVD player Digital rights management Public-key cryptography PlayStation 2 Peter Gabriel SCART Computer and video games Television Greatest (Duran Duran) Jon Lech Johansen Film Fahrenheit 9/11 Citizen Kane Modchip Movie projector Windows 2000 Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In The Star Wars Holiday Special Anamorphic widescreen Digital video recorder Oasis (band) Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting The Mary Tyler Moore Show Mixtape Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!

does anyone know about wiring up speakers replacing speakers in speaker cabinets etc i have an old set of marantz home speakers and the inch woofer blew out so i put in a alesis pa speaker and when i play the speaker now it lights up on the inside and i can see it through the air release port is it possible this is not the proper wiring and the wires are heating up and im going to ruin this speaker yeah it sounds like you will end up damaging something transducers in this case your woofers cannot be mixed and matched each type has it's own impedance wattage rating and each has it's own spl so if these weren't causing damage it is unlikely that they are the same sensitivety as the originals they probably need to be crossed over to the high frequencies at somewhere else in the audioband too if you can't find someone to fix 'em try to find the original ratings ideal volume wattage rating and spl frequency slope on line and find new woofers that come close there are several marantz owners on the web that can help  Loudspeaker Subwoofer Audio crossover Circuit design Transformer Antenna (radio) Impedance matching Vacuum tube Sound pressure level Transmission line Transistor Electronic organ Electronic amplifier Car audio Tweeter Fuse (electrical) Audiophile Bass guitar Jet engine Resistor Operational amplifier Low-pass filter Oscilloscope Incandescent light bulb Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Hard disk Tire Welding Electrostatic loudspeaker Decibel Fire fighting Delay line memory Acoustics Sound Tesla coil Electric motor Spark plug Atari 8-bit family DualDisc Overhead lines Color Diving regulator Gas metal arc welding Piezoelectricity Impedance Speed of sound Lightning Hearing impairment Capacitor Domestic AC power plugs and sockets M16 (rifle) Hearing aid Magnet Resonance Potentiometer Drill bit Professional wrestling match types Thermostat Carburetor Relay Diode Coaxial cable Internal ballistics Blasting cap Frequency Torpedo Burglar alarm Game Boy Electrical wiring Synthesizer Solar power KEF Compact disc Two-stroke cycle Overhead powerline X10 (industry standard) Fan (implement) High fidelity Barbed wire Phoneme Dance Dance Revolution Overclocking Mattress Original Amiga chipset Tank Headphones Web crawler TGV Modem Klipsch Sensor Electrical generator Circuit breaker Severe weather terminology (United States) Naval mine Sound recording Flux Temperature Furnace

is there a difference in hdmi cables if there is a difference what are the specs what does the pin vs pin change or improve why i can see cables costing and some costing thank you for your time despite alot of misinformation available on the internet there are significant difference between different hdmi cables when trying to decided between a higher priced cable and a lower priced cable a good rule of thumb is to weigh the value of what you are connecting for example let's say you just spent on a small lcd for a kid's bedroom don't buy the monster m hd cable save your money and get a good quality monster cable m hd instead the reason for this suggestion is because while the m cable will give you superior performance it doesn't make sense to spend this much on a cable for a television that only cost additionally the smaller the display the more difficult it will be to discern the differences between the lower quality cable and the top end cable now let's say you just bought a p display spend the and get the best quality monster cable m hd or other length depending on your needs you will be able to see the differences on the larger higher resolution display the larger the screen size the more obvious these differences will be you will find it will not be worth saving very little money in relation to your total investment on a sub par cable remember as is the case with most all audio video products specs do not determine a systems performance it is the combination of quality high performance components that make the differenct between and okay system and a great system while there are cheap cables out there that will work there are also cheap tires at wal mart for your bmw they may allow your bmw to roll down the street but the performance you paid for in the purchase of your bmw goes out the window without the correct tires don't let you av system suffer the same way at the same time don't waste your money putting bmw tires on a yugo get educated visit the eduction center in the link below to learn more detailed information about the hdmi technology i hope this information is helpful  Digital photography Cable television Inflation Television Gross domestic product SCART Laptop PlayStation 3 High-definition television CPU cache Laserdisc Atari 8-bit family IPod Oscilloscope Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Liquid crystal display Loudspeaker Microeconomics FairTax Universal Serial Bus Tax Audiophile Redundant array of independent disks Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Wind turbine IMac High-Definition Multimedia Interface Bluetooth BMW M5 Digital single-lens reflex cameras Light-emitting diode Bond Screenplay Digital television Capitalism Outsourcing NTSC IBM PC compatible Password Stereoscopy High fidelity Sport utility vehicle Deflation (economics) Final Fantasy XI Broadband Internet access Labor theory of value Gas metal arc welding FireWire Embedded system Carburetor Ethernet Mutual fund TFT LCD ATI Technologies Nintendo Entertainment System Windows XP Airbus A380 Modem Supply and demand Plasma display Diesel engine TurboGrafx 16 Solar cell Personal rapid transit Surplus value Graduate school Light rail Professional wrestling slang Poker jargon Digital Subscriber Line Hyperinflation 3dfx Nintendo DS Isetta Home cinema Game Boy Nintendo GameCube BMW Z1 Analog-to-digital converter Keynesian economics Solar power Monopsony Apple Macintosh Supply-side economics Handheld game console PlayStation Portable Xbox Free trade TiVo Galactic Civilizations Radeon Bicycle frame Progressive tax

blu ray worth the price is blu ray dvd really worth the extra price i saw at best buy they played an actual dvd on it an older movie that was supposedly up scaled on a blu ray dvd and it was horrible and blotchy but whenever i see it normally it looks great its like a whole new picture is it worth the extra or is it just better to wait until they actual make the movies more worthwile for the blu ray well first off i wouldn't put much faith in best buy's displays most of them aren't configured properly besides which upscaled dvd is not nearly the same as a true blu ray disc next if you don't have a large screen hdtv don't even worry about either blu ray or hd dvd at this time but even if you do have a large screen hdtv it's still too early to get involved with either hd video format at this time too many people remember the last major video format war between vhs and betamax were still new on the market eventually vhs won out but not before a lot of people had purchased betamax players furthermore the picture difference between a good upscaled dvd player and blu ray hd dvd just isn't as great compared to vhs vs normal dvd even then dvd didn't require a new tv even your old tv would show a dramatic improvement with dvd between the expensive requirement of needing a hdtv the relative high price of players and the small and still very expensive library of movies neither hd format is really worth it at this time  High-definition television Laserdisc DVD VHS 8 mm video format Warez Videocassette recorder Camcorder Television Betamax Blu-ray Disc DVD recorder Poker jargon Video Videotape Widescreen Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting S-VHS Video CD Inflation Macrovision Movie projector Digital rights management Blu Cantrell Floppy disk Betacam Home cinema Gramophone record Video 2000 Pump It Up Nintendo GameCube Atari 8-bit family Pornography Format war Atari ST Computer and video games Who Framed Roger Rabbit PlayStation 2 MPEG-2 Microeconomics IBM PC compatible $ale of the Century Dolby Laboratories First-sale doctrine Color Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Xbox Radeon Compact disc Digital photography CPU design Amstrad CPC NTSC Wheel of Fortune The Cure Motion picture rating system S__CAM PowerBook Gross domestic product Betting (poker) Craps Beatmania IIDX Enterprise content management Anamorphic widescreen Audiophile Sony The Criterion Collection Late Night with Conan O'Brien Pornography in Japan Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Oscilloscope Scale model Sega Saturn DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Stereoscopy Letterbox Digital cinematography Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles System/36 Deflation (economics) H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Sega Dreamcast Screenshot Movie theater Marilyn Monroe Delta Goodrem JVC Ra (board game) Best Buy Baseball Stars Beavis and Butt-head Regional lockout Paintball

what is the point of high end a v wires when it all comes in on coaxial it dawns on me that hd cable service and hd satellite service come to my components by coaxial cable now most everything i have ever seen about quality levels from different wire types shows coax at the bottom of every list so what is the difference between the wire that brings in the signal and the wire that connects to my components is it because the signal processors that use the coax connection are anlaog only if coax can bring the hd digital signal to my house why can't a tv use the hd signal on coax an easier question to ask than to answer properly the main thing to understand is that what comes over the cable and into the cable box or satellite box is a different type of signal than what comes out of the box and the different signal types can be degraded in different ways a cable tv cable coming to your house or the cable coming from the satellite dish contains information for many different channel signals spread across a wide frequency spectrum for digital signals which you seem to be most interested in here the picture as well as the sound for every channel you can get is there on the cable encoded digitally at one frequency or another the broadband cable is designed to carry all these signals at the same time to the decoder box and does a fine job of it the job of the box is to select and decode just the channel you want to watch and send that signal to your tv and or sound system however your eyes and ears cannot sense digital data so at some point the signals must be converted back to analog this is where a lot of the confusion comes in once the signals are analog they are subject to degradation the rankings of quality for different types of cables with coaxial on the bottom have to do with the type of signals they carry this is mostly an issue when you are sending an analog signal from the box to the tv the reason composite which is transmitted by an rca cable that you are thinking of as coaxial is on the bottom of this list is not so much because coaxial is bad cable it's not but because this particular coaxial carries an analog signal that is already a kludge a modulated combination of a black level lumina and color information chroma a device called a comb filter in your tv must seperate out these two components potentially causing signal degradation next on the quality list is s video which uses different wires to carry the chroma and lumina information which is better but still requires the tv to decode color information from the degradable analog chroma signal even better is component cables which sends the analog signal for each color independently each of these analog cable options is actually coaxial in construction so it's not the cable type it's the signal type that leads to differences in ultimate quality this is why you want to use decent cables to transmit the signals without degradation but recognize that high priced exotic cables are still subject to the limitations of the signal type now in the hdtv world things are a bit different pun intended your hd cable box will still output analog signals which are subject to some of the same types of degradation as standard analog signals a bigger problem is that the tv now has to digitize that signal that started digital but is now analog back into a digital format and re map it to pixels resulting in some degradation so the best objective is to get the signal to the tv in digital format and let the tv do the decoding more or less directly to the pixels in this case the box is just picking out the right channel and converting it to bits that are sent to the tv and or sound system often the digital bit stream for audio and video signals are seperated and in fact again all the different options are essentially coaxial cables in different forms here you are absolutely correct in thinking that any cable that can successfully get the bits from one place to another will work equally well in the digital realm there is even less reason to use exotic or expensive cables but because there are multiple bitstreams involved there generally needs to be more than one wire used and thus multi connection formats such as spdif and hdmi really just multiple coaxial wires bundled together are used since these cables are mechanically more complex than a single signal rca cable they can be a little more expensive but there is still no need for a fancy expensive version where a simple one will do also it is technically possible to just run the same cable that comes into the house directly to the tv provided that the tv has an integrated digital cable tuner or cable card capability all the connections and converstions i talked about above are still present they are just being done internally to the set whew hope this helped  Xbox 360 Video codec Amstrad CPC IS-95 ATSC Code division multiple access CPU cache DV IPod Universal Serial Bus

surround sound i just bought a pioneer surround sound system for the xbox it sounds great on the but i got directv hooked up yesterday and when i watch tv with the surround sound on there is a delay in the sound ex when people talk on the tv their mouths move and a second later the sound comes out of the surround sound speakers now with the surround sound off and the audio just out of the tv its perfect any suggestions on how to hook up the directv to the surround sound without any audio delay we have had two or three similar questions in this section recently each time the questioner had the audio sent to the tv first and then to the surround sound system this shouldn't be a problem unless you have the tv's audio set to some kind of artificial surround mode surround on a tv is for people who have no external surround sound system still it seems that some model or models of tvs must have a defect of some kind in their audio outputs try sending the audio directly from the satellite receiver to the surround sound system if you still have this problem after doing so then you have a problem with the pioneer system i have heard of substandard chips in receivers causing an audio delay if the problem is with the receiver i would return the whole system and get an onkyo surround sound system  Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Laserdisc Television Xbox 360 Modem Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis SCART Atari 8-bit family Super Nintendo Entertainment System Subwoofer Radar Pirate decryption Hearing impairment MP3 DirecTV X Window System Nintendo Entertainment System Communications satellite Speech synthesis Video game music Oscilloscope ZX Spectrum Sega Dreamcast Original Amiga chipset Apple IIGS Urinary incontinence TiVo High-definition television Vorbis XM Satellite Radio PlayStation Portable IPod IBM PC compatible Cable television Computer Super Audio CD Mixing console Digital television Atari ST Amstrad CPC Central processing unit Satellite television Digital audio broadcasting Audio system measurements MiniDisc Surround sound Musical Instrument Digital Interface DVD Speed of light Sound effect Radio Electronic amplifier PlayStation 3 Phonograph Voice over IP Floppy disk S__CAM Stereophonic sound Bose Corporation Hard disk Home cinema TurboGrafx 16 Gramophone record Artificial neural network Amiga Sound card Microphone GunZ The Duel AmigaOS Radiation hardening Solar system Acorn Electron MOS Technology SID CPU cache Citigroup Timeline of computing 1990-forward Cyberspace Stuttering RISC MIPS architecture Dolby Digital Commodore 64 Sega Saturn Reel-to-reel audio tape recording Speech recognition Dolby Pro Logic Logic Second language acquisition Nintendo Revolution Direct broadcast satellite Audiophile General relativity International Phonetic Alphabet PC Engine

i've heard blu rays can hold gigs per side but how many gigs does the average blu ray movie actually use blu ray was designed to hold just over four hours of high definition video when encoded at a constant bit rate of mbps onto a gb dual layer disc individual movies have different run times and the bit rate can vary depending on the choices made by the people doing the encoding so individual movies can end up using less than half of a blu ray disc's capacity or a particularly long movie encoded at a high bit rate can fill the disc to capacity referenced below is a list of the actual gb used on individual blu ray movies for example the blu ray version of good night and good luck uses gb for the movie portion and gb total including menus extras etc pearl harbor which runs over three hours and is encoded at a fairly high bit rate packs gb for the movie alone and nearly maxes out the dual layer blu ray capacity at gb total see a list of bit rates and capacities for individual blu ray movie titles in the wikipedia resource link below  DVD MP3 Blu-ray Disc Floppy disk Laserdisc H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Movie projector Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Pump It Up Hard disk CPU cache PlayStation Portable Super Audio CD High-definition television CD-ROM ITunes Phase-shift keying Color Video codec Oscilloscope Resident Evil (video game) Analog-to-digital converter Addressing mode DualDisc Redundant array of independent disks ITU-T MPEG-2 Video CD IPod Compact audio cassette ATI Technologies Phase (matter) DVD-R Final Fantasy VI DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX UTF-8 DV Unicode Uniform Resource Locator Unemployment Modchip Blu Cantrell Modem XML SMPTE time code Ship ITunes Music Store Drill bit Baseball Stars Federal Standard 1037C Inflation Endianness RISC Scooby-Doo Unix time ALGOL 68 Internal ballistics Expert system Autodesk Media and Entertainment Wind power Solar cell Super Nintendo Entertainment System Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Original Amiga chipset DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution IS-95 X86 assembly language Digital audio broadcasting PlayStation 2 DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Macromedia Flash USS Tunny (SS-282) Nintendo GameCube Extended display identification data Atari 8-bit family Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Hash table Casting Astronomical seeing Lossless data compression Information entropy Pentium 4 Explosive material Jet engine Nintendo DS Gramophone record Motorola 68000 Audiophile CD recorder IBM PC Apollo Guidance Computer Asynchronous Transfer Mode Communications protocol Digital audio Music QuickTime PC Engine Central processing unit

watts in house party alright first off i have two technics floor standing speakers with peak power how much is that in continuous rms power second off about how many watts are used in a house party lets say inside a garage or in the yard and last but not least considering the facts i gave about my speaker what amp would be good first off robert pay attention peak power is not twice the rms this will vary according to the frequency response of the speaker since we don't have the overall frequency range or a curve for calculation there is no way to calculate a rms figure or even to guess at one since the rating should be derived from hz khz you are better off looking up the model for legacy information by contacting technics directly but this number is not of any real use the peak rating is for at a maximum how much power you never want to exceed supplying to the speaker as far as a amp do you want a receiver or separates are you wanting to use these speakers for a dj set up for parties or do you want to have a hi fi set up just know you don't want any amp to exceed that peak figure in its rating your question needs a little more detail to properly recommend any types or brands of equipment also the tonal qualities of these will greatly vary the kind of sound you get so what do you like  Audiophile Audio power Circuit design Decibel Bass guitar Alternating current Electric motor Cellular network Operational amplifier Transformer Antenna (radio) Impedance Audio system measurements Kenwood Electronics Psychoacoustics NTSC Oscilloscope Solar cell Transistor X10 (industry standard) Normal distribution Resistor MP3 Inflation Shortwave Solar power Parliament of Canada Subwoofer Hard disk Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Instrument amplifier Labor theory of value Electric guitar Action potential Armored Core Microeconomics Microphone British House of Commons Electrophysiology Electrical generator AC power Economics Global Positioning System Wind power Welding Impedance matching Insurance Wind turbine Color Amateur radio Violin Capacitor Fluorescent lamp Supply and demand Speed limit Analog sound vs. digital sound Effective radiated power ITU-R 468 noise weighting Movie projector Artificial neural network Gramophone record Modem Black body High fidelity Supply-side economics Lac operon Radar Transmitter Vacuum cleaner Radio Root mean square Bicycle lighting Credit card Citizens' band radio Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Diode Exponential growth Amplitude Low-pass filter Explosive material Modelocking Password Effects unit Tone (linguistics) Failure rate Unicode Marshall Amplification Digital-to-analog converter Super Nintendo Entertainment System Speed of light Keynesian economics Rigging Parliament of the United Kingdom Vorbis

speakers design i saw how it's made about that it was on discovery channel i think they wound wires around a driver which was a magnet bonded with ceramics and that drive the cone made of paper or synthetics to make the sounds i think the best home theater answer for most people is a powered sub woofer plus smaller satellite speakers bose was big on promoting that but many others are making matched systems to do this now a friend of mine's dad has these huge klipschorn corner horns which sound great but cost a ton the sub satellite set up is much more affordable and easier to fit into most rooms  Loudspeaker Subwoofer Bose Corporation Transformer Audio crossover KEF Antenna (radio) Magnet Klipsch Audiophile Impedance matching Tweeter RISC Naval mine Radar Stereophonic sound IBM PC compatible Toyota MR2 Ceramics Vacuum tube Computer Electric motor Electronic organ Modem Clarinet Bass guitar Inertial confinement fusion Tank Transistor Solar power satellite Electrostatic loudspeaker High fidelity Magnetic core memory TGV Spacecraft propulsion Lightsaber Violin Turbocharger Oscilloscope Nintendo GameCube Space elevator Atari 8-bit family IPod Headphones Hydrogen economy Nakamichi Taikyoku shogi Redundant array of independent disks Radio Continuously variable transmission Uranium The Adventures of Pete & Pete Gramophone record Spark plug Space Shuttle program Sound Blaster GoldenEye Digital audio broadcasting Andes Floppy disk Plastic Saxophone Strap-on dildo Leslie speaker Automatic Warning System Home cinema Professional wrestling match types Cinerama Home Box Office Pebble bed reactor Punch card Quadraphonic Hearing aid Fuse (electrical) Sound recording Land Rover Discovery Radio controlled airplane Sun Barbed wire Wind turbine Music radio CPU design History of radio Drifting (motorsport) Straw-bale construction Energy development Car audio Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Tesla coil DVD Battery electric vehicle Hard disk Aircraft carrier Model aircraft Fixed-wing aircraft Magnetism Panama Canal

projector or tv i'm looking to buy a lcd projector or a larger television set which one do you think is better for the money and what brands would you recommend i'm not looking to spend too much money but i want something nice this should depend on what other components you are using with your home theatre for example if you are very concerned about the quality resolution of your picture you would want to go with a regular tv set rather than a projector some projectors can produce the same quality as flat panel tvs but you would need to spend a large amount of money for one if you aren't so concerned about picture quality perhaps if you don't really have hi def inputs cable set top boxes blu ray ps etc you would be able to go with a projector and most likely get a bigger screen size for your money however projector screens generally don't perform very well in rooms that aren't considerably dark so if your viewing room is more lighted or you have windows in it you may want to consider a flat panel instead lcd flat panels are very good at handling reflective light overall my opinion would be that a flat panel tv is a better investment as far as plasma or lcd flat panels panasonic would pretty much be top of the line but samsung is good if you don't necessarily want to shell out too much cash and they are still very high quality tvs if you decide to go the projector and screen route sony projectors pretty much dominate as far as the screens it really doesn't make too much difference but draper is a safe bet hope this helps nick ryan  Liquid crystal display Television Liquid crystal display television Plasma display Movie projector Digital photography Loudspeaker High-definition television Projection screen Oscilloscope PlayStation Portable DLP Poker jargon Solar power TFT LCD Digital projector Home cinema Widescreen Cathode ray tube Photography Movie theater Light-emitting diode IMAX Laptop IMac Gross domestic product Solar cell Lighting Panasonic SCART LCD projector Digital television Home Box Office Computer display Screensaver Betting (poker) Game show Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Slide projector Handheld game console Craps Inflation Sharp Corporation Stereoscopy Digital cinematography Paintball Color Mutual fund Digital Visual Interface November (film) ITV Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Laserdisc Digital cinema Teletext Theory of conduct Universal Studios High fidelity Textile manufacturing Windows XP Film Wood Xbox 360 Gameking Contrast ratio FairTax Floppy disk The Suffering (game) PLATO Samsung Nintendo Virtual Boy Mattress Gas metal arc welding Drill bit Sound Blaster Microeconomics Virtual memory Embedded system Wood carving Xbox Let's Make a Deal Bluetooth Blu-ray Disc Avenue Q Atari 8-bit family Mouse (computing) Dance Dance Revolution $ale of the Century Glass Headlight Marshall Plan Light rail

best sound reciever home theater with hdmi pcm i've been looking for a home sound receiver to compliment my ps i'm looking for a sound receiver that is hdmi enable that supports dolby true hd dts hd and uncompressed pcm is there such machine yet also i'm a bit ignorant about receivers so if you could educate me as to what to buy i would appreciate it but if there's anything above it that is worth it i'll go for it as long as its a quality product i want the receiver initially for the ps to enjoy uncompressed pcm games and movies if anyone can help i would appreciate it hi what is your budget there are some very good receivers which support the features you want but they are all priced differently also there are new features coming out all the time it is hard to keep up with the technological changes some of these receivers are so complicated you need a licence to set them up that's why we get a lot of questions about them on answers hdmi can be a problem it is not as simple as people are led to believe ok if you let us know how much you can spend we will give you some suggestions addition information thanks for the e mail one of the best receivers just released is the denon avr ci the specifications are very impressive and it definitely has tru hd dts hd this is what is said about the pcm signal you are after i'm not sure if this is what you want but this is what they say conversion of optical or coaxial digital signals to analog audio outputs for nd and rd rooms pcm only i hope that's what you want i don't use a receiver myself as my sound system is geared for hi fi music reproduction with separate stereo pre and power amps the greatest compromise in a receiver is the use of a single power supply for all three sections the pre amp the power amp and the tuner the needs of the power amp section affect the pre amp section not good the result is receivers no matter how well made and expensive are not as smooth effortless open and full sounding as separate components with their own power supplies one important improvement of this denon is the inclusion of power transformers and power supply circuits as far as i know none of the other popular receivers has this feature it is one huge step forward for a receiver now there is one thing left to do all amplifiers have their own particular sound it is possible to hear differences between them when using the same speakers the difference in sound quality between them is not as pronounced as there is when you listen to different speakers but the differences are there denon is a brand you can trust and i have never heard someone say they do not perform well so there you are mate if the specifications are to your liking i feel you can't go wrong with this model particularly with the extra power suppy etc although the rec ret price is about i have seen it advertised for around here is a link to check it out http www crutchfield com s wojn drb f cgi bin prodview asp i av c edit i have not looked at any other brands yet but if you like i can do that but they wont have the extra power supplies like the denon  Loudspeaker MP3 Audiophile Compact disc Dolby Laboratories Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Operational amplifier Movie projector Home cinema Atari ST Television Blu-ray Disc XML MiniDisc High-definition television High fidelity Amstrad CPC Gramophone record PlayStation 3 Super Audio CD Super Nintendo Entertainment System Analog-to-digital converter Musical Instrument Digital Interface 8 mm video format Sound Blaster Bass guitar Kenwood Electronics Subwoofer Atari 8-bit family Electronic amplifier Xbox Modem Phonograph Audio data compression Original Amiga chipset Warez Digital audio C programming language Synthesizer SCART Central processing unit Transformer Enterprise content management High-Definition Multimedia Interface Nintendo 64 Computer Dolby Digital VHS S/PDIF Acorn Computers Pulse-code modulation Digital circuit ZX Spectrum Surround sound Voice over IP Compact audio cassette DVD-Audio CPU cache Video game music Oscilloscope Microphone Camcorder GSM services Visual Basic Federal Standard 1037C PHP Ethernet Electric guitar Telephone Decibel Circuit design NTSC Sound effect IPod Vorbis Impedance matching Social rule Microeconomics Gmail ATI Technologies Inflation Diode Sega CD Cassette deck Teletext

combining hdmi cable to one input both my cable box and my dvd player use hdmi cables but my lcd tv only has one hdmi port i know i can buy a switchbox to accomplish hooking them both up to the one port but why wouldn't a hdmi splitter allow for them to be hooked up the same way as long as i make sure the dvd player is off when i use cable and vice versa the signal should still pass through to the tv right these are the best switchers on the market and it's cheaper than those overpriced ones you see in the stores  DVD SCART Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting High-Definition Multimedia Interface Television Digital Visual Interface Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sega Digital video recorder Dolby Laboratories 1080p High-definition television Cable television Xbox Universal Serial Bus Home cinema Digital Subscriber Line Sega Dreamcast Game Boy Advance Oscilloscope TurboGrafx 16 Pok__mon Box IPod Karaoke Laserdisc Xbox 360 Nintendo DS Commodore 64 TiVo RCA connector Solar power Blu-ray Disc Watch Sega CD IMac Loudspeaker Home Box Office Coaxial cable PlayStation 3 RS-232 Ethernet Sound Blaster Communications satellite Advanced Technology Attachment Videocassette recorder Bluetooth VHS Transformer High fidelity Video codec Regional lockout Amiga Handheld game console Vision mixer Effects pedal Atari ST S-Video Game Boy Micro Game port Media in Canada Digital rights management IBM PC compatible PlayStation 2 Digital television PlayStation Portable EMac Digital photography Nintendo GameCube DVD player USB flash drive Digital camera Walkman Light-emitting diode WWOR-TV Netfilter/iptables Audiophile Game Boy S/PDIF Anchor British Sky Broadcasting AmigaOS Liquid crystal display Computer and video games Embedded system Sharp Zaurus Pornography Animal Crossing TFT LCD High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection Rail terminology Central processing unit Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Digital cable Hard disk Sega Saturn ABS-CBN Poker jargon Transmission line Diplexer Musical Instrument Digital Interface

how do i set up my dvd player to show full widescreen on my tv when i play widescreen dvd's they show up on my widescreen tv with black bars on top and down how do i get the full widescreen view on a widescreen tv without the black bars this is a common problem and the answer is likely one of the following or perhaps a combination of the two check your dvd player settings note not your tv you should have an aspect ratio or tv output setting that lets you choose one of the following full screen widescreen select make sure your tv is in the mode not one of the expanded or stretch modes and you should be good to go if you've checked and found that this wasn't the problem or if you've checked found it was the problem but still see black bars on the top and bottom when viewing some movies then it is likely due to the aspect ratio of the original film films are shot in a bunch of varied aspect ratios some of the more typical are this is called academy standard and is most commonly referred to as full frame full screen or non hdtv television programs are displayed in an aspect ration similar to this and all films that were shot before the 's were filmed in this format when correctly displayed on a widescreen tv you should see vertical black bars on the left and right side of the screen after the invention of the television hello 's the exhibition branch of the studio system was in a downward spiral how do you keep audiences from staying at home and watching the boob tube why a new aspect ratio that is not available on the tv that's how enter the age of widescreen this aspect ratio is most commonly referred to as and many hdtv television programs are displayed in this format your widescreen tv is so films in this format will display without any bars whatsoever pop some popcorn and enjoy what's wider than widescreen why this aspect ratio which is commonly referred to as anamorphic widescreen or cinemascope special lenses are used to achieve this aspect ratio and many epics are filmed in this format think lawrence of arabia and it's sense of desert grandeur it is also commonly adopted by auteurs seeking to further accentuate their individual style think wes anderson's use of anamorphic in his films rushmore and the royal tenenbaums for example when viewing films shot in this format you will experience black bars at the top and bottom of the screen to help accommodate the wider aspect ratio this is normal and there is no way around this unless you gasp choose to use a zoom setting on your tv but this detracts from the viewing experience this was a little long winded but i hope it helps  High-definition television Movie projector 35 mm film Letterbox Panavision Stereoscopy Cinerama Cinemascope Video Cinematography NTSC Beatmania IIDX 3-D film DVD Pan and scan IMAX Computer display standard Matte (filmmaking) 3-perf and 2-perf pulldown Digital photography Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Digital television Todd-AO Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Movie camera Sega Dreamcast Infantilism The Criterion Collection Digital cinema Pixel 16 mm film Panoramic photography Babylon 5 Tom and Jerry (MGM) Oscilloscope Mouse (computing) Digital cinematography Windows Vista ATSC Computer and video game genres View camera Photography Resident Evil 4 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Leica Redundant array of independent disks X86 assembly language Eye DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 70 mm film Dance Dance Revolution Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis The Ultimate Matrix Collection Poker jargon Liquid crystal display Bubble Bobble EIA-708 Screenshot C programming language Resident Evil: Apocalypse Color Graphics Adapter MPEG-2 Karaoke MP3 A Course In Miracles GunBound Amstrad CPC Computer animation Snooker Star Wars VistaVision Projection screen TGV DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Gramophone record SCART Inflation Textile manufacturing Marching band Gradius Bicycle X Window System Star Trek: Enterprise RGB color model Atari 8-bit family Unicode The Internet Movie Database Technicolor

harmon kardon harmon kardon for an a v receiver hey watch your language just kidding seriously though the simple answer to your quesiton is yes that's all i've got that is if i could restrain myself which i can't i think its a great brand and not just great looking which they are way better looking than nearly all other receivers in the upper mid level category that they sit at the top of but more importantly their latest generation of av surround sound receivers are super feature packed with stuff like hdmi switching and component switching of course xm radio input ready ipod docking on the hnl whole nutha level that offers on screen we're talking your flatscreen tv big control of your ipod contents its like having a frakkin' music server docked to your receiver and tv awesome unlike lesser brands like pioneer sony technics and the rest h k as us pros refer to them shares a different better sounding design as receivers from respected lines like yamaha and denon and rotel and nad which rely more on high capacitance rather than simply on high wattage figures in other words watts per channel wpc of h k is better than wpc of pioneer for example so when the big explosions or theme music kicks in the pioneer will poop out fast and go kind of flat while the h k will knock your socks off no kidding does that answer your oh so simple question i sure hope so if not let me know cheers  IPod Television Windows 2000 Walkman Loudspeaker Apple Macintosh DVD Synthesizer Apple Computer Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Audiophile Sound Blaster Transistor Oscilloscope IPod nano PlayStation Portable Computer Gramophone record Nintendo Bicycle lighting ITunes Subwoofer Skateboarding trick IPod shuffle Modem Internet Relay Chat Whose Line Is It Anyway?

what do i need to do in order to hook my laptop up to my tv to watch movies i have an svideo hook up on both the laptop and the tv is there anything but an svideo hook up in order to get the video on the tv i will have to use a y audio cable for the sound correct we have a dvd player but this is a downloaded movie on my laptop i bought a svideo cord and already have a y rca cord for the audio i'll be trying it as soon as i get the tv which does have an s hookup on the back away from my brother these days most tvs have an s video port on the back but if yours does not there is a way to convert s video to composite not to be confused with component video by the way composite video is the standard yellow color coded rca type connector same type as the red and white audio jacks but not using the same cable for video you must use a coaxial video cable audio uses a non coaxial type have i made matters worse or better yet converting the s output of your laptop to the composite video your tv may require is not a simple affair there are adaptors for this but you may not necessarily find one at radio shack would certainly be worth the phone call though meanwhile your best bet would be to have a tv with the s video connector on it you can find one for cheap on craigslist in your area of this i am certain the other part of your question a y adaptor meaning a stereo mini plug coming from your headphone output to a pair of female rca red white jacks is the way to go for getting audio out of the laptop or you can also buy a longer y that has the stereo mini plug on one end with longer leads and male rca plugs on the other good luck and let me know how it goes  Television Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis SCART RCA connector Jack plug IPod Universal Serial Bus DVD S/PDIF Xbox D-subminiature S-Video Laserdisc Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting RCA Nintendo Entertainment System Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Musical Instrument Digital Interface Laptop PC Engine Headphones Ethernet PlayStation Portable NTSC Loudspeaker Xbox 360 Copy protection Gender of connectors and fasteners Compact disc DIN connector Desktop computer AES/EBU Composite video Modem Oscilloscope Computer bus TRS connector Commodore 64 USB flash drive TIA-568A/B Coaxial cable Walkman Sega Dreamcast Sound card Personal computer Sound Blaster Game Boy Advance Component video Cable television Registered jack Gramophone record High fidelity Telephone exchange Atari 8-bit family Lighting Original Amiga chipset Karaoke Light-emitting diode Stereoscopy Archos Sound recording S-VHS Synthesizer Audiophile American Broadcasting Company Digital Visual Interface MPEG-2 NBC MP3 RGB color model BS 1363 Liquid crystal display Home cinema Game Boy ATI Technologies Poker jargon TRS-80 Digital photography Transformer IBM PC compatible Power cord Nintendo GameCube Apple Macintosh Radio Graphics card 25-pair color code Dolby Digital Nintendo 64 Amiga

best audio input if you had the choice between coaxial optical ch analog or hdmi what would you choose and why optical is my first choice followed closely by coaxial this is the area where my closet purist streak comes out i think hdmi is a great sloution for carrying hd video and digital audio on one cable to minimize mess and clutter and all but i like my sound to run along a completely different cable than my video i've seen what crosstalk and interferenfe looks like on an oscilloscope and let me tell you it aint pretty keeping audio and video separated gee just like they do in high quality av receivers and disc players just makes good sense as far as channel that ususally means you're relying on the d a converter onboard your disc player umm that's asking for trouble too let your av receiver do the number crunching its likely got a better engine for that good luck and let me know how it goes  Laserdisc DVD Cable television Compact disc SCART Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Sound recording Audiophile High-definition television Gramophone record High fidelity S/PDIF Loudspeaker RCA connector Analog-to-digital converter Movie projector Home cinema Optical fiber Nintendo GameCube Digital television Coaxial cable AES/EBU Digital audio MP3 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Federal Standard 1037C NTSC Ethernet Phonograph Betacam Digital Visual Interface Modem Blu-ray Disc GSM services Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sound card Multitrack recording Transformer Walkman Camcorder Video Radio Telephone Sega Dreamcast Dolby Digital Sound Blaster High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection Decibel Video codec MiniDisc Set-top box Sega CD Electronic amplifier DV Digital Theatre System Satellite television S-Video ITU-T Super Video CD Sound effect Optical disc DVD-Audio Xbox Analog signal Disc jockey Electronics Digital audio workstation PlayStation Portable Audio system measurements Digital cable 1080p Gravis Ultrasound Dither Copy protection Bluetooth Audio level compression Super Audio CD ATSC Digital audio broadcasting Aliasing Original Amiga chipset VHS Digital video PlayStation 3 Karaoke Transmission line British Sky Broadcasting Broadcast television system Digital circuit Serial Digital Interface Synthesizer Audio data compression Digital-to-analog converter HD Radio Transistor

why do i need video part of a v receiver for home theater i'm looking for a receiver for my home theater system i understand why i need audio receiver but i can only find a v receiver and not audio alone for video i can connect my dvd player vcr etc directly to the tv and use a universal remote control what's the benefit of having video receiver you don't your direct hookup scenario will work fine and may actually provide better video quality as the signal has gone through less cable and switches many current tvs also allow picture settings to be optimized per input so using a receiver to do the video switching also defeats this advantage the main advantages of using the receiver to do the switching are in cable management you can have one set of cables rather than or going to your tv this is especially important with a wall mounted flatscreen where a jumble of cables going up to the tv is unsightly if done right it can also result in simpler remote operation i would estimate of the moderate level a v installations i've seen less than half actually use the receiver to do video switching  SCART Television DVD High-definition television VHS Laserdisc Remote control Home cinema Digital television PlayStation Portable S-VHS Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Xbox Cable television High-voltage direct current Bluetooth S__CAM Digital video recorder GSM services IP Multimedia Subsystem Light-emitting diode Atari 8-bit family Modem Dimmer Musical Instrument Digital Interface Videocassette recorder X10 (industry standard) Universal Serial Bus Super Nintendo Entertainment System IPod Mouse (computing) Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis NTSC Digital photography RS-232 Electronic amplifier Composite video Ethernet NEC Corporation Loudspeaker Broadband Internet access Camcorder High fidelity Copy protection Vision mixer S-Video MPEG-2 8 mm video format Information Services Procurement Library Sega Dreamcast Macrovision ITU-T Digital circuit Widescreen Electrical wiring Set-top box Data compression Audiophile Video codec Transistor Windows XP Transformer Amstrad CPC Teletext Jack plug X Window System Computer Radio Broadband Networks Personal rapid transit MP3 Railway signal Programmable logic controller Power line communication Atari 2600 Original Amiga chipset Voice over IP TiVo Integrated Services Digital Network Audio data compression Digital audio broadcasting Solar power CMOS Windows 2000 Movie projector RCA connector Federal Standard 1037C Electric motor Embedded system Network Switching Subsystem Windows Vista Common Unix Printing System Receiver (radio) Quality of service Digital Subscriber Line

who knows about the bose speakers how is the sound are they good for electronic musics and what amp is good for them and how is the high frequency sound of is it from back or front of the speakers and can a high frequency sound be ok when it coms from back of the speakers and how is the high frequency sound of is it from back or front of the speakers can a high frequency sound be ok when it coms from the back of the speakers hi the bose direct reflecting loudspeaker was released in by dr amar bose who founded the bose corp in he studied at the massachusetts institute of technology where he became an electrical engineer he also studied in the field of psychoacoustics his loudspeaker design was the result of extensive research into how we interpret the sound we hear at a live event he maintained that at a live event we hear more reflected sound than direct sound this is the principal incorporated into the the speaker enclosure is in the shape of a triangle at the rear of the enclosure are eight inch full range drivers four on each angle of the triangle and one inch full range speaker on the front baffle the original was advertised as having unlimited power handling capacity i have only heard it once in at the first hi fi consumer show in australia it was being demonstrated in one of the rooms of the hotel where the show was being held it was driven by a bose watt per channel amplifier which had a special equalizer to extend the frequency range in the bass and treble region the sound stage was enormous and sound was all around the room as the result of the speakers in the rear of the enclosure facing the front wall of the room it was a type of sound you either loved or hated enormous sound stage at the expense of pin point accuracy as the years progressed the speaker had many alterations to improve its sound and dispersion pattern and it has survived to day in the latest version the series v so the bottom line is to listen first to see if you like the sound additional information each of the little speakers is a full range speaker hard to believe isn't it each speaker radiates the bass midrange and treble so the treble is bouncing off the walls with the rear drivers and radiating towards you with the single front speaker you hear treble as a delayed and forward dispersion but it will not sound as sharp and clear as a single forward facing tweeter in a normal speaker in other words it is diffused that is why you must listen to them to see if you can live with them i hope that helps  Bass guitar Subwoofer Audiophile Microphone Instrument amplifier KEF High fidelity Surround sound Antenna (radio) Headphones Transformer Car audio Stereophonic sound Leslie speaker Radar Headlight Acoustics Hearing impairment Speed of light Audio crossover Equine conformation MP3 Gramophone record Klipsch Electrostatic loudspeaker Tank Radio Solar cell Universal Serial Bus Electronic amplifier TGV Magnet Piezoelectricity Transmitter Transistor Low-pass filter Timpani Car handling Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Psychoacoustics Professional wrestling throws Piano Light-emitting diode Kenwood Electronics DVD Laser Hard disk M16 (rifle) Impedance matching Motorcycle Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sound effect Electric guitar Television Compact disc Electric motor View camera Electromagnetic radiation Mazda RX-7 Computer Oscilloscope Wind turbine Advanced Technology Attachment Phonograph Solar power Rail terminology Helicopter Electromagnetic spectrum John F.

monster cables or hdmi which one is better and why when you say monster cables i assume you mean monster component cables vs hdmi i'd suggest hdmi it is a totally digital signal so you don't have to worry about signal loss like you do with component cable because of that you can get a really cheap hdmi cable got mine for from mwave com whereas with component cable you need to spend a lot of money to get the high quality well insulated cables for monster besides that at least in my experience hdmi creates a better picture when i first got my ps i had both monster component cables and hdmi into my i tv hdmi looked just a little bit sharper than component  High-Definition Multimedia Interface Television SCART Audiophile Loudspeaker Cable television RCA connector High fidelity PlayStation 3 British Sky Broadcasting Laserdisc Telegraphy Home cinema Digital television Audio data compression Transformer Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Broadband Internet access RGB color model Coaxial cable Digital Subscriber Line Electric power transmission Oscilloscope Optical fiber Submarine communications cable Digital Visual Interface High-definition television Transmission line Phase-shift keying S-VHS Dolby Laboratories Universal Serial Bus Digital cinematography Digital cable High-voltage direct current Energy development Composite video Frequency modulation Static inverter plant Space Shuttle program Modem Mediumwave Synthesizer Radiation hardening S/PDIF William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin Printed circuit board Game theory NTSC Universal Studios Electronics Circuit design Electronic amplifier High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection Texas Instruments Federal Standard 1037C Time-domain reflectometer Solar power Avenue Q Digital audio Digital Hardware random number generator Aircraft flight control systems Transistor Nintendo GameCube Compact disc AES/EBU Ethernet Communications satellite Transatlantic telegraph cable Naval mine Gross domestic product Impedance Home Box Office Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Satellite television Blu-ray Disc D-subminiature Final Fantasy XI Analog signal MTV File system permissions Stars!

burn in prevention on plasma i know burn in prevention is not a thing but i have heard of something called an orbiter which adjusts the pixels gradually to try and prevent it i have ordered a pioneer plasma pdp hearing and reading it hads the same kind of prevention methods but i cant find it in the manual is it something i need to turn on or does it work on its own all the time any help would be appreciated the orbiter is an automatic pixel shift this moves the image around a few pixels every minute or so while the set is in use slowly enough that you don't notice but enough to decrease the probability of well defined burn in it is usually on by default and the exact settings can be adjusted in the setup menu  Spacecraft propulsion Mercury Atlas 6 Autostereogram Apple typography Eye Pixel Planetary orbit Mouse (computing) Welding Dither Plasma display Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Simulated annealing Original Amiga chipset Carburetor Windows XP PlayStation Portable Cassini-Huygens Cheating in Counter-Strike STS-62 STS-61 RGB color model Pixel art Year Mars Exploration Rover PNG Galileo spacecraft Computed tomography Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Mandelbrot set Computer display standard Orbital period Danger Hiptop Screenshot Fischer Random Chess ITunes Nuclear fusion Video Electrophysiology Vostok 1 Tesla coil Carpal tunnel syndrome Atomic orbital Quake III Arena Lighting MESSENGER Digital photography Solar system Liquid crystal display Equation of time Hypoglycemia Atari 8-bit family Microeconomics Halo 2 Universal Century Technology Probability Enterprise content management Ra (board game) Rendering (computer graphics) Windows Vista Gemini 8 AppleScript Daylight saving time Palm OS Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Television Clementine mission 2D computer graphics Vacuum Motion compensation Gradius Multifunctional display (Orbiter sim) Nuclear magnetic resonance Stereoscopy Texas Instruments TMS9918 Gas tungsten arc welding Light pollution Turbocharger Black hole Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Apollo 8 Hard disk High-definition television Inflation JPEG PaX Genetic algorithm Killian documents Saturn V Computer printer Motility WindowBlinds Lathe Connectionism RuneScape cheats Julia set Color Graphics Adapter Alien vs. Predator (film) Timeline of the Universe

will my current subwoofer work with this new surround sound system its this system http www bestbuy com site olspage jsp skuid type product id with my subwoofer http www mtxhome com p subs sw aspx like with the cable hook ups but on the back on the receiver it only has one cable input i guess thats for the sub provided would it still work i mean to replace the sub that comes with the system what do you mean work with are you intending to add this as additional sub or as a replacement for what is there i surmise that you want to add base to the system and think this is the best way to do it further if you do add it as a additional sub you will hear base and only base more often than not these cheap little systems ramp up the treble and base to sell the system they are to make noise and not to accurately reproduce sound especially if it is from sony but since you have decided to go ahead with this kind of set up here is how you make it sound ok base management set the subs close to one another and set the crossover for each to the included for higher base freqs and the mtx to the lower freqs available have no overlap if you are wanting to add dimension to the sound stage then i suggest you ditch this htib for a separates receiver speaker setup and have full range tower speakers and use you existing mtx for base reinforcement  Loudspeaker Subwoofer Surround sound Car audio JavaServer Pages Electronic amplifier Microphone SAS System Analog-to-digital converter Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Modem Common Unix Printing System DVD Nintendo DS Piano Walkman High fidelity Submarine Oscilloscope Transformer Atari 8-bit family Sound reinforcement system PDP-11 Wind turbine Wi-Fi Trombone XML Mixing console Operational amplifier Bose Corporation Computer Amstrad CPC Ajax (programming) International Phonetic Alphabet Renewable energy Anti-aircraft warfare MP3 X Window System High-voltage direct current MAME Ethernet Headphones Welding Synthesizer Rheumatoid arthritis Digital audio broadcasting Universal Serial Bus Sound Blaster Phoneme Website Geographic information system Coaxial cable Phonograph Non-native pronunciations of English NTSC ZX Spectrum Solar cell Audio system measurements Airport PlayStation Portable Anchor SCART Windows 2000 Dog agility Gradius Gramophone record Quadraphonic Broadband Internet access Pinball PHP IP (complexity) Radar Vowel Radeon Phase-locked loop Chinese language Acorn Computers Bluetooth Xbox History of the New York City Subway Product Lifecycle Management Game programming Low-pass filter Mouse (computing) MIPS architecture Musical Instrument Digital Interface Space elevator Digital photography Embedded system Sega Dreamcast Solar power Impedance matching Decibel Uninterruptible power supply

if a dome shaped dust cover in the center of a speaker is dented in is there a way to pull it back out also will it affect the performance of the speaker as stated above there is no way you could hear the difference one way or the other one down side to the pin approach is that if it's a non ported or small ported speaker enclosure you may end up creating a place for the pressure wave inside the cabinet to escape creating a hissing or whistling sound although this is very unlikely i have seen it happen the method some experts swear by is using a shop vac just turn it on and gently place the hose over the dented area and let the suction pull it out be gentle though as the dust cover can come off or tear quite easily with some speaker cone types paper in particular there is no perfect solution but between this and the suggestion above you should be able to do your best and done carefully no harm will come to the speaker at all  Loudspeaker Bong Subwoofer Pottery Vacuum Internal ballistics Vacuum cleaner Electrophysiology Professional wrestling holds Irrigation Colony in Space Menstrual cup Naruto jutsu Gramophone record Microphone Drill bit Canoe Mercury 4 Land mine Color Parachute Diving regulator Vegeta Glossary of firefighting equipment Black hole Bass guitar Fire extinguisher General relativity Anchor Mach number Two-stroke cycle Siphon Lightning Fire fighting Tide Naval mine Geology of the Moon Cartridge (firearms) Expansion chamber Rail terminology Dog Modem The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Terminal ballistics Spark plug Items in the Metroid series Magic (illusion) Glossary of firefighting terms Textile manufacturing Magnet Eye Hydraulic machinery Enceladus (moon) Casting Movie projector Firearm Equine conformation Anemometer The Time Machine Transformer Milton H.

how do dvd players scan dvds like make them work a dvd player is very similar to a cd player it has a laser assembly that shines the laser beam onto the surface of the disc to read the pattern of bumps the fundamental job of the cd player is to focus the laser on the track of bumps the laser beam passes through the polycarbonate layer reflects off the aluminum layer and hits an opto electronic device that detects changes in light the bumps reflect light differently than the lands the rest of the aluminum layer and the opto electronic sensor detects that change in reflectivity the electronics in the drive interpret the changes in reflectivity in order to read the bits that make up the bytes the hardest part is keeping the laser beam centered on the data track this centering is the job of the tracking system the tracking system as it plays the cd has to continually move the laser outward as the laser moves outward from the center of the disc the bumps move past the laser faster this happens because the linear or tangential speed of the bumps is equal to the radius times the speed at which the disc is revolving rpm therefore as the laser moves outward the spindle motor must slow the speed of the cd that way the bumps travel past the laser at a constant speed and the data comes off the disc at a constant rate  DVD CD-R Hard disk Laser Gramophone record Radar Floppy disk Speed of light Holography Laserdisc Blu-ray Disc CD recorder Welding Inertial guidance system CD-ROM Galileo spacecraft Electric motor Movie projector Diode Directed-energy weapon Faster-than-light Sound recording DualDisc Cyclotron Tank Particle accelerator Laser engraving Universal Century Technology Super Audio CD Oscilloscope Mars Exploration Rover LIDAR Sensor MP3 Volleyball Piezoelectricity Tribes 2 Photon Early IBM disk storage Black hole Laser diode Carburetor DVD-R Headlight Magneto-optical drive Mass spectrometry Planetary orbit CPU cache Car handling Redundant array of independent disks Antenna (radio) Optical fiber Jet engine Loudspeaker Disk storage Sega Dreamcast Vacuum tube Nintendo GameCube STS-62 Aluminium Diffraction Digital photography ATLAS experiment Solar cell Inertial confinement fusion Seismometer Solar sail R-Type Amateur telescope making VHS Confocal laser scanning microscopy Light Gamma ray burst Photolithography Technology in the Stargate universe Digital recording Nanotechnology SETI Action potential Maxwell's equations Coriolis effect General relativity Dynamic random access memory PowerBook Super Nintendo Entertainment System Digital Sun Project Orion Compact audio cassette Printed circuit board Gravitational radiation

which of these subwoofer can produce a deeper lower base see inside i am looking for a subwoofer with base so low just like the one in the movie theaters that shakes your whole body best if they can shake windows floor too which of these is closer to doing it jbl venue series sub inch or sony's saw subwoofer hi there is no way of knowing until you have one in your entertainment room you will never get the result at home that you get in a cinema unless your room is over a hundred feet long the very low bass notes to hz which can be over feet long can develop in a cinema because of the length inside the building also the walls of a cinema are usually thicker than what you have at home if you want the windows and floor to shake the rest of the sound will be terrible however putting the sub in a corner and turning the volume to max should give you what you want edit have you given any thought to other people who will have to put up with your noise subwoofers have made some peoples lives miserable there is enough noise pollution already without creating more but then again people today have no consideration for others they only look after themselves  Subwoofer Home cinema Movie theater It's All Gone Pete Tong Basement Surround sound Stairway Fire fighting Clarinet Car audio Bose Corporation Pipe organ Dundas Square Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) Customs and etiquette of Japan Vacuum Bass guitar Compact audio cassette Xanadu House Naval mine Equine conformation Wilton House Audi A2 Movie projector 1957 World Series John Cage Whip Scenes from a Memory Wood Shoe Drill bit Bus models used in New York City Transit Holkham Hall Nine Inch Nails Opportunity rover Dither THX Noise pollution Echo chamber Rathfarnham Karaoke Mattress Guitar Passenger car The Dalek Invasion of Earth Dial M for Murder Insulation Genesis (band) Matt Hardy MP3 The Jackson 5 Milton H.

surround sound how does a stereo receiver take a surround sound signal from a dvd player which includes left right front and left right rear and a center speaker audio through a cable that goes to the receiver that only has left and right how does the receiver take a signal and is able to figure out that a sound like a jet flying is going from the front left to the back right otherwise the jets sound would come from all the speakers at the same time no rose it's you what you are describing is pro logic surround which is a faux surround in order to obtain true channel surround your dvd player would be connected to your receiver using a single digital coax cable or an optical digital cable with real surround the single digital cable contains separate signals for each of the five surround channels with pro logic surround a mathematical algorithm is applied to the stereo signal and a digital processor decides when looking at different sounds within the soundtracks place in the stereo sound field left and right as well as phase a sound out of phase is sent to the rear what speaker each sound will be sent to pro logic surround has mono rear speakers meaning that both rear speaker are sent the same signal it may seem that a sound is coming from the right front and going to the left rear but the fact is that when the sound is in the rear it is coming from both speakers equally the illusion is made because the left front speaker is also making the sound giving the appearance of sound generating from the left rear  Dolby Laboratories Dolby Digital Surround sound Loudspeaker Sound Blaster High fidelity FM broadcasting Dolby Pro Logic Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Microphone Multitrack recording DVD Stereoscopy Modem MP3 Stereophonic sound Laserdisc Sound recording IPod Synthesizer Audiophile 8 mm video format Television Decibel Mixing console Cable television Impedance matching Frequency modulation Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Effects pedal Quadraphonic Xbox NTSC Home cinema Subwoofer Sound effect Logic MiniDisc Jack plug SCART Super Audio CD Receiver (radio) Atari ST Digital audio workstation Color Sound reinforcement system MPEG-2 HD Radio S/PDIF DVD-Audio Radio Remaster Sound card Ethernet Digital audio broadcasting Oscilloscope Complex number Telephone exchange Universal Serial Bus AES/EBU Car audio Anamorphic widescreen Amstrad CPC Digital circuit RS-232 3D audio effect Sega CD Telephone Xbox 360 Bluetooth One-time pad Radar Transformer Digital Natural deduction Digital audio Audio data compression Central processing unit NICAM D-subminiature Original Amiga chipset DVD player Nintendo GameCube Super Video CD Cray-1 Phase-shift keying Single-sideband modulation Circuit design Game Boy Real number

which speaker do you recommend boston acoustics or bose for home stereo and electronic musics hi the only way to buy a particular brand of speaker is to listen to as many as you can in your price range before deciding on one a good loudspeaker will reproduce all kinds of music without emphasising any part of its frequency range also the amplifier you use will have some bearing on what you buy as you can see from other answerer's they either love bose or hate boss i would not buy a bose speaker system simply because i don't like the sound colouration i am not familiar with boston acoustics so i can't comment i prefer british loudspeakers which generally have a neutral type of sound so as not to be disappointed buy the speakers which sound good to you irrespective of the brand name  Bose Corporation High fidelity Subwoofer Audiophile Bass guitar Headphones Microphone Stereophonic sound Gramophone record Player piano Synthesizer Impedance matching Surround sound Electronic organ Instrument amplifier Home cinema Binaural recording Audio crossover Super Audio CD Receiver (radio) Electrostatic loudspeaker KEF Sound reinforcement system Vowel Decibel Magnetic cartridge Audio feedback Electronic amplifier Hiberno-English Sound recording Organ (music) Radio Esperanto as an international language Acoustics Sound effect Sound Color Audi A2 Amplifier Analog-to-digital converter Amstrad CPC Car audio Jack plug Audio system measurements Effects unit Electric guitar Effects pedal Grateful Dead Equal-loudness contour Modem Pet Sounds MP3 Low-pass filter Sonar Bicycle lighting Piezoelectricity Muddy Waters Herbie Hancock Electronic music DVD Electronic filter Stethoscope Electromagnetic spectrum Australian English Compact audio cassette Walkman Singlish Mixing console Commodore International Ubykh language Harmonic series (music) Medical ultrasonography Double bass High-end audio Stereoscopy Kenwood Electronics English grammar Clarinet Hearing impairment Speech synthesis Magnet Dobro The Pet Sounds Sessions Electronic musical instrument Klipsch Remote control Bluegrass music Panasonic Music radio Audio power Marshall Amplification Roland Corporation Gender-neutral language Leslie speaker Guitar Hearing aid Violin

where is the best place to put a subwoofer in a room i know subs are louder in certain places when you walk around a room so im just wondering where i can put it to get the most out of it if you are a surround sound enthusiast then the best place for the sub is behind the tv its worth looking at the construction of your room do you have floorboards it may be worth placing a thin peice of foam under the sub to prevent feedback along the floor this also creates a sweeter bass note building a sub into coffee tables etc is not unknown but some people do not like cables hanging about the place and you are limited as to where to put the sub besides the missus might not like it most subs like the corner of the room about ten inches from each wall the bass will then resonate off each wall along the floor and fill the room if the sub is of the non passive type with its own amp built in set the volume to about half but this depends on your set up hope this helps to the poster below you above everyone else should know that in the audio visual world everyones requirements differ no two listening rooms are the same what may work for one may not work for another but all rooms have one thing in common they all have corners  Loudspeaker Subwoofer Bass guitar Guitar Electronic amplifier Car audio Fire fighting Basement Audiophile Transformer Xanadu House Seismic retrofit Clarinet Surround sound Operational amplifier Stairway Timpani Dundas Square Stuttering Japanese tea ceremony Flute Wood Ethernet Out-of-body experience Home cinema Professional wrestling match types Authentic performance Insulation G-Man (Half-Life) Violin Mattress Casting Poker jargon Doom engine Solar power Audio level compression Geodesic dome Compact audio cassette Double bass Microphone The Dalek Invasion of Earth Stave church High fidelity Radar Vowel Glossary of partner dance terms Model aircraft Fischer Random Chess Timber framing Kitchen Gramophone record Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Thermal power station John Cage Naval mine The Wall Valve sound Bose Corporation MP3 Bristol Grammar School Low-pass filter Acoustics Echo chamber Nine Inch Nails Compact disc Electric guitar Electrophysiology Karaoke Circuit design Audi A2 John Frusciante Animal Crossing Submarine Strap-on dildo Sento Single Transferable Vote Paragliding Radio Stereophonic sound Cube (film) Lighting Antenna (radio) Billboard (advertising) Laserdisc Great Pyramid of Giza Hearing impairment Drill bit Office Chaco Culture National Historical Park Action potential Television studio Chatsworth House Movie projector Radar cross section The Doctor Dances Theater (structure) Pipe organ Oceanic trench
