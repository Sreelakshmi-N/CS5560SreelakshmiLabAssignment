tap water question i usually drink purified water but sometimes the delivery is late and i have to drink boiled water that has been cooled in the fridge obviously why is it that when i drink boiled tap water i usually experience some discomfort in my chest area sort of like a mild heartburn but more frequent tap water is loaded with chlorine and fluoride so if your body is not used to these chemicals then it may give you some discomfort the local governments tell you fluoride is good for your teeth but fluoride doesn't work that way it is a topical acting chemical that is like if you got a cut and ate a tube of neosporin to heal it fluoride is a waste product of many industrial processes and dumping it into your water is a cheap way for companies to get rid of it  Hydrochloric acid Tooth enamel Fluoride therapy Fluorine Hydrogen chloride Cocaine Water Brewery Nuclear power Tooth Plastic Bottled water Dental caries Sulfuric acid Aluminium Chlorine Ammonia Coffee Titanium Fossil fuel power plant Maple syrup Nuclear reactor Vitamin C Chlorination Acetic acid Hydrogen economy Molten salt reactor Sea-Monkey Hydrofluoric acid Nitric acid Methamphetamine Fractional distillation Volcano Haloalkane Wood pulp Sewage treatment Heartburn Beer Calcium Hard water Menstrual cycle Gastroesophageal reflux disease Silver Halogen Hypoglycemia Ozone depletion Radium Mercury (element) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ice cream Ramen Use of poison gas in World War I Explosive material Fountain Body piercing Asthma Hydrogen Hazardous waste Town gas Toothpaste Alcohol Air conditioning Energy development Sodium hypochlorite Plutonium Alternative biochemistry Ozone hole Hiberno-English Sugar Petroleum Japanese tea ceremony Autonomous building Mineral Smoke-screen Water pollution Hemp Allergy Zinc Urine Krypton Sauna Conjunctivitis Chocolate Nutrition Drink Tofu Boiling point Fecal incontinence Alcoholic beverage Water supply Radon Rooibos Survival skills Distillation Dairy Hydrogen peroxide

why is it that when people say o'doul's still has a little alcohol in it they fail to realize that that the alcoholic content of o'doul's is generally around according to their website which is similar to the alcoholic content of orange juice a study recently performed by the university of indiana demonstrates that orange juice tends to have an alcoholic rating of to and even newly bought grape juice can have a rating as high as so why am i being carded for o'doul's amber but not being carded for orange juice or grape juice there is no rational reason for this to continue the phrase but there is still a little bit of alcohol in it is already addressed by the alcohol in orange juice it promotes underage drinking is the most idiotic thing i've ever heard if you want to drink for the sake of drinking you don't buy fake beer would somebody tell me why this idiocy is permitted to continue please actually john you can i recently wrote a letter to the board of alcoholic beverage control in utah one of the most alcohol strict states in the country about the o'doul's dilemma the presumably mormon representative who answered informed me that o'doul's is not an alcoholic beverage according to the law it is as alcoholic as orange juice or grape juice like you said and that is why legally a minor can purchase and consume drinks like o'douls the problem however is that your average grocery store clerk isn't actually aware of this they're trained to treat it like real beer because that's what managers think it is the problem is in store policies not legislation although some conservative counties and cities may have laws against minors purchasing and drinking o'douls they are rather the exception to the rule why you'd want to drink an o'douls is beyond me but if you really want to go for it just take a copy of the necessary legislation with you and be prepared to fight with a skeptical manager over it good luck  Alcoholic beverage Prohibition Mothers Against Drunk Driving Word of Wisdom Legal drinking age Soft drink Pisco Microeconomics Rum Supermarket Digital rights management Binge drinking Systembolaget Motion picture rating system Alcoholism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Cider Sake Coffee Drink Absinthe Alcoholics Anonymous Blood alcohol content Economics Champagne (beverage) Contract Gun politics Tobacco smoking Video game controversy Theory of conduct Gun politics in the United States ITunes Music Store Beer Pong Driver's license Kosher foods Food Stamp Program South African Breweries Breastfeeding Coca-Cola Medical prescription Scientology beliefs and practices Fanta Traumatic incident reduction Breakfast Coffeehouse Culture of France The Coca-Cola Company Convenience store Grog Drinking culture Health insurance Copy protection Milk Government of Maryland Cigarette President (game) Tax Public house Drunk driving (United States) Prohibition (drugs) Australian words Alcohol Same-sex marriage in the United States Internet fraud Veganism Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses French cuisine Gin Distilled beverage Commodity markets Guinness Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc.

how is instant coffee really made how do they do it bascially instant coffee is just regularly brewed coffee with nearly all the water removed it's not that mysterious a process at all there is no strange chemical adulteration that goes on instant coffee is still pure coffee there are two methods for producing instant coffee crystals freeze drying and spray drying the freeze drying method preserved the most 'coffee flavour' but it's a more involved procedure first the coffee is allowed to sit so the water evaporates naturally leaving a concentrated coffee solution this concentrate is then frozen to around celsius the remaining water freezes into ice crystals sublimation a natural process similar to evaporation is used to remove the ice what's left is dry grains of coffee the second method is spray drying the water is again allowed to evaporate forming a concentrate the concentrated coffee is sprayed from a high tower in a large hot air chamber as the droplets fall the remaining water evaporates dry crystals of coffee fall to the bottom of the chamber the high temperatures involved in this method do tend to effect the oils of the coffee and more flavour is lost  Instant coffee Coffee Water (molecule) Carbon dioxide Tofu Brewery Evaporation Food preservation Water Desert Freeze drying Ice cream Lake Tea Explosive material Water vapor Fog Casting Sugar beet Weathering Micro-encapsulation Fire fighting Acetic acid Cloud Phase (matter) Thermal power station Solvent Decaffeination Cryonics Chocolate Caffeine Steam engine Air conditioning Cider Gilding Soy protein Dishwasher Flue gas desulfurization Sugarcane Dry cleaning Rice Solar power Vacuum Titanium Hydrogen Ice Hydrogen peroxide Opportunity rover Honey Swamp cooler White phosphorus incendiary Beer Hydrogen sulfide Gas metal arc welding Ice core Yerba mate Fire extinguisher Common cold Thermoregulation Isotope separation Water purification Collodion process Powder metallurgy Contrail Brewing Sedimentary rock Renewable energy Smoke-screen Sodium chloride Freeze distillation Methamphetamine Edible salt Sugar Bread Haloalkane Cha chaan teng Energy development Ozone depletion Copper extraction Hard water Tissue engineering Vanilla Diseases of the honeybee Pottery Paint Dairy product Incandescent light bulb Concentration Thunderstorm Alcoholic beverage Cookware and bakeware Ozone hole

i'm trying to stay up until my bf gets off work at midnight whats the best time me to drink a cup of coffee i don't have to work in the morning that's the only reason why i'm attemting to stay up other than the fact of seeing my boyfriend try one at if you're in an earlier time zone than me and another at since you don't have to work i wouldn't worry too much about the effect of caffeine you can always try some no doz or vivarin but they tend to make me really jittery i'd probably have cups of coffee if you're very concerned about sleeping but space them apart and by the way caffeine can stay in your system for several hours so if you really want to go to bed any time soon you might want to avoid it i don't have any caffeine for at least hours before bedtime so keep that in mind just find something really entertaining to do play a game watch a great movie read a wonderful book call someone interesting and that should distract you enough if you're that tired no amount of caffeine will keep you awake but it might wake you up after you've fallen asleep have a good night  Insomnia Sleep Caffeine Coffee Sleep debt Daylight saving time Social rule Philosophical skepticism Word of Wisdom Avenue Q Apollo 8 The Shining (film) Narcolepsy Energy drink Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Canonical hours Breakfast Milton H.

bellyache after silk soy milk i seem to get a stomach ache a bit after drinking silk soy chai latte i am lactose intolerent so i have to use a subsitute i drink rice milk unfortunately not many coffee shops do rice so i had a little bit of silk soy chai latte and now my belly aches a bit i use to drink soy but stopped because it gave me belly aches i ate soy chocolate ice cream yesterday and was fine so can anyone give me some advice or feedback thanks it sounds like you're allergic to soy but if you ate soy based ice cream without any problem then i would assume that isn't the problem check the amount of soy in the ice cream and also the amount in the latte if it is a big chain coffee shop they will probably have this nutritional information listed on their website and maybe even on a pamphlet in the store if the latte has a very large amount of soy and the ice cream only has a small amount maybe you're allergic after all other than an allergy i really can't think of what the problem was maybe you're allergic to something else in the latte the spices in the chai for example  Soy milk Milk Ice cream Tofu Food Breakfast Cheese Lactose intolerance Veganism Chocolate Cat Meat analogue Cuisine of Singapore Soybean Japanese cuisine Soft drink Breastfeeding Dairy Food allergy Kit Kat German cuisine Coeliac disease Allergy Cha chaan teng McDonald's Yoghurt Espresso Crohn's disease Vegetarianism Wine Chai Drink Cuisine of Malaysia Cappuccino Fecal incontinence Natt__ Stomach cancer Cuisine of Laos Twix Diarrhea Spider Soy protein Oreo Mango Milkshake Heath bar Starbucks Fancy rat Cold Stone Creamery Ramen Dairy product Sauce Insomnia Protein Korean cuisine Russian cuisine Irritable bowel syndrome Cuisine of Denmark Taiwanese cuisine Vernor's Questionable Content Bubble tea Healthy eating 7-Eleven Lactobacillus acidophilus Cantonese cuisine Gelato Hamster Soy sauce Cream (food) French cuisine Peruvian cuisine Peanut Botany Atkins Nutritional Approach Alcoholics Anonymous Cuisine of Vietnam Cuisine of Austria Soup Singlish Cake Guinea pig Adjustable gastric band Nutrition Customs and etiquette of Japan New Zealand English Insulin Mochi Rice pudding Frappuccino Bengali cuisine Taboo food and drink Charles Darwin's illness Urinary incontinence Sento Omega-3 fatty acid

have you ever tried energy drinks such as red bull if so how did you react to them i see many brands of energy drinks i have never tried any of them i was thinking of doing so but i am concerned these drinks will have an adverse effect on me such as making me over stimulated or causing rapid heartbeat i would appreciate your input please and thank you the basis of the majority of energy drinks is caffeine for example a can of red bull is about the same amount of caffeine as two cans of coke you can think of it like alcohol hard liquor is more expensive but it will get you drunker quicker but beer is cheaper and will bring on the buzz a lot slower and make you pee more wikipedia's page on energy drinks is great tons of info i'm linking that in the source so you can check out the info and decide if you'd like to try one yourself i think red bull is an acquired taste i didn't like it the first time i drank it but i had about cans given to me for free and when i had nothing to drink but that or water i wanted some kind of flavor so in forcing myself to drink them i started to enjoy them but then i've done the same with beer x some people just don't like the taste of energy drinks i have always enjoyed trying different types of sodas so i don't notice any flavor or weirdness that is consistent throughout all energy drinks if you like orange soda you would probably enjoy the full throttle fury brand it's in a red can tastes like orange soda full throttle blue demon is in a blue can and it's got a very berry type flavor to it i enjoy both the biggest drawback to energy drinks is their price but if you drink one energy drink to every two or three sodas to get the same effect it's really about the same price a pack of red bull costs about in my neck of the woods you'll never know if you like it till you try it  Coffee Soft drink Caffeine Mountain Dew Chocolate Energy drink The Coca-Cola Company Red Bull Coca-Cola OK Soda Diet soda Alcoholic beverage Shasta (soft drink) Tea Beer Wine Miller Brewing Rum Yerba mate Fanta Gatorade Cider New Coke Gin Microeconomics Ramen Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc.

how to make the best iced tea i bought an iced tea maker so i don't always have to run to the store to buy more i just can't seem to get it right i have been trying to make green tea with honey and sweet tea with splenda i am thinking about trying to add lemon to either of these anyone have tips for the right amount of these ingredients to add and the right amount of teabags my recipe for making iced tea doesn't involve an iced tea maker but perhaps you could adapt this to the machine i put about a quart of water the amount doesn't matter at all and approximately a cup of sugar in a cooking pot and heat until it boils you could adjust the amount of sugar or use an equivalent amount of artificial sweetener depending on your taste once the water starts to boil i add either four of the large family size tea bags or regular tea bags and immediately remove the pot from the burner let the bags steep in the hot water for at least minutes but an hour or more just makes it better then take your concentrated tea mixture and pour into a gallon pitcher or bottle fill the bottle to the top with tap water and you'll have perfect southern style sweet tea  Tea Rum Ice cream Japanese tea ceremony Cuisine of the Philippines Japanese cuisine Beer Hong Kong-style milk tea Halva Bread Barbecue Yerba mate Turkish coffee Cider Russian cuisine Breakfast Soft drink Chocolate Lemonade Maple syrup Sugar Honey Caffeine Milk Cantonese cuisine Ketchup Horehound Champagne (beverage) Sweet tea Soup Bubble tea Idli Cajun cuisine Sake Food preservation Espresso Wine making Fujian tea ceremony Chili con carne Peruvian cuisine Bong Yoghurt Jewish cuisine Cuisine of Brazil Herbal tea Martini cocktail Alcoholic beverage Carbon dioxide Cuisine of Singapore Cha chaan teng German cuisine Vinegar Wine Cooking weights and measures Sugar substitute Ramen Coca-Cola Kitchen Single malt Scotch Cuisine of Denmark Gatorade Dumpling Pancake Cocaine Sangr__a Basil Bengali cuisine Bacon Pot Noodle Soy milk Water Portable stove Apple pie Teapot Pizza Diet soda Dialysis Healthy eating Rebreather Diet Coke In-N-Out Burger Slow cooker Korean cuisine Water purification Rooibos Cuisine of Malaysia Houseplant Chai Egg (food) Sulfuric acid Bagel Thermal power station

where can i buy sugar free syrups for coffee in the uk i run a popular coffee shop and use loads of syrups all the time i have to be honest the sugar free ones are horrible and there is a debate over the health risks posed by what the companies add to them my argument would be that everything is fine in moderation if your only gonna have one nice cup a day then a bit of syrup isn't gonna kill you also i've found that over time you can aquire the taste for less sugar and enjoy the taste of the coffee more good milk naturaly sweetens when you heat it if you have a good barista that uses good ingredients then you can have a of coffee that tastes sweet without adding anything try making your own vanilla sugar just by leaving some pods in your sugar it's an old chefs trick and it works a treat i know this doesn't strictly answer your question but i really think you should leave sugar free syrups alone good luck  Coffee Chocolate Sugar Espresso Breakfast Milk Ice cream Maple syrup Aspartame Turkish coffee Sugar beet Coca-Cola Rice pudding Milkshake Cuisine of Singapore Cheese Sugar substitute Diet soda Yoghurt Singlish Soy milk Hong Kong-style milk tea Pancake Kit Kat Cha chaan teng Cappuccino Tofu Dr Pepper Bubble tea Starbucks Bengali cuisine Rum German cuisine Japanese cuisine Pecan pie Honey Vinegar Atkins Nutritional Approach Healthy eating Cake Polish cuisine Cajun cuisine Pepsi-Cola Pomegranate Sucrose Dairy Questionable Content Saccharin French toast Wine Golden syrup Sake New Coke Candy Lemonade The Coca-Cola Company The Sims 2: University Sucralose Cigar Theory of conduct Jaggery Tequila Glycerin Breastfeeding Organic food In-N-Out Burger Chili con carne Mooncake Polyols Baklava Barbecue Hamster Food preservation Gatorade Soul food Hypoglycemia Horehound Moonshine Queen (band) Microeconomics Ketchup Brewery Cheesecake Date Palm Recurring South Park characters Marshmallow Mountain Dew Halva Heath bar American Chinese cuisine Liqueur Qualia Starch Cough medicine Vegetarianism

does tapping the top of a soda can three times really prevent it from exploding when you open it when a carbonated beverage is shaken and then opened it usually explodes but somehow i was told to tap poke the top three times fairly hard adn it wont explode why is this or is it just coincidence it helps by bringing the bubbles to the surface to pop before the can is opened otherwise the bubbles come from the bottom shooting up really fast causing it to 'explode' addt details here's a more scientific expanation tapping on the top of a carbonated beverage can or bottle before opening it may help prevent the drink from exploding out of the can upon opening although it might not be sufficient sparkling or carbonated beverages contain carbon dioxide gas that is dissolved in the liquid by pressurizing the contents of the can when the can is opened the mixture depressurizes and the carbon dioxide comes out of solution escaping as carbon dioxide gas if there is liquid between the gas bubble and the outside of the can then some of the liquid may be pushed out of the can with the bubble the pressure gradient when the can is opened is greatest near the opening and the carbon dioxide at the top of the can escapes first in addition to tapping on the can the risk of getting soaked is reduced if the can or bottle is opened slowly rather than quickly because then the initial pressure change is less significant so the gas can escape less forcefully the wider the top of the container the better the chance to avoid an accident since there is more volume for gas without intervening liquid  Carbon dioxide Bong Rebreather Explosive material Welding Carbonated water Plastic Decompression sickness Champagne (beverage) Nuclear power Fire extinguisher Volcano Drink Gas metal arc welding Polyethylene terephthalate Water (molecule) Brewery Nitrogen Liquid breathing Water purification Breathing gas Cider Guinness Drowning Internal ballistics Lake Carbon dioxide sink Wine Pebble bed reactor Alcoholic beverage Carburetor Nitroglycerin Acetic acid Coffee Ammonia Soft drink Alcohol fuel Petroleum Siphon Fire fighting Gasoline Kyoto Protocol Tap (valve) Bubble Bobble Ice core Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Origin of life Natural gas Bottled water Ocean thermal energy conversion Nuclear reactor Hydrogen economy Sewage treatment Scuba set Alternative biochemistry Pulmonary alveolus Waste management Sulfur Portable stove Global warming Permian-Triassic extinction event Food preservation Geology of the Moon Coal Iron Coca-Cola Alkane Sun Phase (matter) Tooth Hydrochloric acid Haloalkane Charles Momsen Alcoholic proof E85 Partial pressure Lake Nyos Stoma Blast furnace Plutonium Oxygen sensor Methanol Earth's atmosphere Sugar beet Gum arabic Aluminium Carbon Keg Lake Kivu Methane Flue gas desulfurization

why do people tap the top of a can when it comes out of a coke machine i've seen it a million times and it doesn't make sense the myth is that tapping will reduce the chance of the can bubbling foaming over as you know if you take a can of soda and shake it it will foam over when you open the can the belief is that tapping the can calms the soda down a lot quicker of course if they just waited the same amount of time the results would be the same so tapping just gives people something to do while their waiting to open the can  Tap (valve) Bread Brewery Carbon dioxide Plastic Wind turbine Origin of life Rebreather Drink Bong Polyurethane Bulk vending Beer Bottled water In-N-Out Burger Bubble Bobble Soft drink Casting GunBound Tap dance Glossary of firefighting equipment Kitchen Space Shuttle external tank Carbonated water Mattress CPU design Dither Tag Foam Surveillance Slurpee Coca-Cola Soap bubble Ice cream Cocaine Coffee Four square Taps and dies Domain Name System Betting (poker) Professional wrestling Donald Neilson Technology Espresso Piccolo Junior Saga OK Soda Time Out of Mind Kurt Angle Iron Maple syrup Dodge Charger Transformer Space Shuttle program Decompression sickness Lake Snapple Bolted joint Scuba set Winning Streak Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Primus (band) Pancake Babe Ruth Lyndon B.

hey i've been drinking water only for about month what else can i do to kick it up a notch it's like boring now not even the ice is exciting and i hate the lemon in it do you drink water with meals if not that would help if you do also try spicing up your meals with pepper garlic italian spices etc to make you drink more water per meal the other suggestions you got of kool aid crystal light etc are also good but don't drink a lot of tea since it's a diuretic adding a little fresh fruit juice is always a nice change of pace from the regular boring plain water but if you're dieting stay away from fruits that need sugar if you been told by your doctor to drink more water or if you're doing it because you realize how important it is to your overall health you may want to try my last resort i've been drinking water all my life i average gallons per day but sometimes even i can't stand the thought of another glass of water my remedy to this is eating salt i'll pour just a little in the palm of my hand lick a small amount and i'm ready for the water eating saltines with or without peanut butter is also very effective in the summertime especially when we sweat a lot we lose quite a bit of salt so replenishing it this way is so much better than adding it to foods of course if you are restricting your salt intake you may not want to try the last one too much if at all i hope i was able to help  Breakfast Tea Cuisine of the Philippines Coffee Rum Wine Cuisine of Brazil Soft drink Japanese cuisine Cuisine of Malaysia Peruvian cuisine Jewish cuisine Tofu Rice pudding Bread Chocolate Cuisine of Denmark Russian cuisine Milk Food Fasting Gatorade Chili con carne Cuisine of the Southern United States Alcoholic beverage French fries German cuisine Ice cream Cuisine of Africa Fecal incontinence Roman eating and drinking Yoghurt Tooth Cha chaan teng Nutrition Water Vegetarianism Tea (meal) Potassium Vitamin C Cantonese cuisine Healthy eating Dim sum French cuisine Hamster Folic acid Vinegar Lemon Japanese tea ceremony Garlic Cheese Curry Peanut butter Hiccup MRE Hypoglycemia Veganism Cuisine of Singapore Beer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kosher foods Cider Korean cuisine Citric acid Cuisine of Thailand Maple syrup Mosquito Cuisine of Argentina Chile pepper Idli Soup Little Britain Cake Soul food Dumpling Cuisine of Laos Meal Stomach cancer Pizza Hangover Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Drowning Hot sauce Binge eating disorder Pancake Omega-3 fatty acid Mango Lemonade Peanut Hong Kong-style milk tea Sauerkraut Diarrhea Serbian cuisine Sodium chloride

recipes for thai iced tea does anyone know how to make thai iced tea a recipe in the traditional format ingredients and their measurements first followed by the process of making the tea would be greatly appreciated thanks thai iced tea is definitely in a category by itself a native grown red leaf tea spiced with star anise cinnamon and vanilla brewed sweetened and served over ice with several tablespoons of evaporated milk or half and half poured on top the biggest challenge other than getting used to the evaporated milk may be tracking down the right tea any decent thai market will sell loose tea you can also purchase thai tea online in the interest of authenticity you may also want to have a real thai tea strainer here's one recipe we like thai iced tea ingredients cups water cup of thai tea cha thai cup sugar to cups evaporated milk or half and half instructions bring the water to a rolling boil in a large saucepan add the tea and remove the pan from the heat stir gently to submerge all the tea leaves in the water steep for about minutes the liquid should turn bright orange and have a strong clean taste with no hint of bitterness pour the brew through a coffee filter or a fine mesh strainer into a large pitcher add the sugar to the hot tea and stir to dissolve cool to room temperature cover and refrigerate until ready to serve at serving time fill tall glasses with crushed ice or ice cubes add enough of the thai tea to fill the glasses about three quarters full then float to tablespoons of evaporated milk over the ice in each glass serve with iced tea spoons so your guests can blend the contrasting white milk and dark tea into the inviting terra cotta color of thai iced tea you can also take shortcuts by using thai iced tea mix or thai iced tea syrup  Hong Kong-style milk tea Brewery Beer Ice cream Cuisine of Singapore Sugar Bread Rice pudding Cuisine of the Philippines Japanese cuisine Turkish coffee Yerba mate Milk Breakfast Brewing Cider Bengali cuisine Black tea Sugarcane Espresso Cuisine of Denmark Vinegar Japanese tea ceremony Cheese Sangr__a Cuisine of Laos Honey Cha chaan teng Cuisine of Malaysia Soft drink Horehound Chili con carne Bong Russian cuisine Mayonnaise Sugar beet Maple syrup Cuisine of Thailand Pancake Martini cocktail Ketchup Wine Milkshake Sake Lemonade Bubble tea Curry Dairy Jewish cuisine Cajun cuisine Chinese tea culture Cookware and bakeware Herbal tea Idli Green tea Carbon dioxide Cocaine Soy milk Kit Kat Cuisine of Brazil Plastic Yoghurt Wine making Barbecue Thermal power station Peruvian cuisine Pizza Dim sum Korean cuisine Soap bubble Champagne (beverage) Cannabis (drug) Polish cuisine Absinthe Haggis Rooibos Rice Mai Tai Tobacco Tortilla French toast Coca-Cola Guinness White tea Drink Cocoa

do you drink bottled water even when the bottle is marked 'pws aquafina announced that their water comes from public water supplies thats tap water folks are you still going to drink it the water that comes from a public or municipal water source is extensively purified before it is bottled most operations will either purify it by distillation or reverse osmosis and it will also be passed through large filter beds to remove chlorine trace organic chemicals and other dissolved solids it will also be disinfected with ozone right before it goes into the bottles the quality of the water that goes into the bottles you buy at the supermarket is not the same as the quality of what comes out of your faucet at home that being the case yes i'll still drink bottled water because it is safer of better quality and more conveniently packaged than the stuff that comes out of the tap  Sewage treatment Water Bottled water Disinfection Chlorine Osmosis Ozone Hydrogen peroxide Dasani Plastic Bong Reverse osmosis Ammonia Swimming pool Acetic acid Beer Chlorination Ethanol Rum Alcoholic beverage Tap water Air conditioning Autonomous building Dry cleaning Hydrochloric acid Cider Fountain Water supply Coffee Chloroform Marine aquarium Ultraviolet Scotch whisky Hard water Moonshine Sodium hypochlorite Water (molecule) Ozone depletion Dairy International response to Hurricane Katrina Wood pulp Bleach Perfume Cryptosporidium Sodium chloride Fish farming Ozone hole Sterilization (microbiology) Kosher foods Polyethylene terephthalate Environmental engineering Town gas Water resources Hydroponics Drink Tea Escherichia coli O157:H7 Single malt Scotch Tap (valve) Dundas Square Sento Infrared spectroscopy Air pollution Sea-Monkey Organic certification Intravenous therapy Alkane Wine making Hamster Vitasoy Water pollution Solvent Nuclear power Glenfiddich PHP Natural gas Energy development Backpacking (wilderness) Refrigerator Portable stove Carbon tetrachloride Cruising (maritime) Sake Survival skills Dr Pepper Gasoline Volcano Nitrogen Eutrophication PepsiCo, Inc.

are there really any health benefits to drinking diet soda it bugs me that people always insist on drinking diet soda all the time even if they don't need it when i say if you want to stay healthy just drink water diet soda is unhealthy they reply um duh diet soda is healthy why do you think it's called diet i know that water is a better beverage than diet soda but are there really any health benefits to drinking diet soda instead of regular or is diet soda just disgusting toxic waste filled with artificial stuff the only benefits are to your teeth unless you are diabetic or otherwise sensitive to sugar it is called diet because most people cut back on calories while they are dieting dieting is probably the worst thing someone can do to themself all they do is induce mild starvation which increases fat storage and reduces metabolism i e gain weight now harder to lose later if i were you i would cut out the soda and any unnatural looking juices they regular kind are essentially a liquid candy something that should be enjoyed on occasion not a staple and i could not have described diet soda any better than you did artificial sweeteners like sugar induce the glycemic response the body's reaction to an expected sugar rush in other words it causes sugar crashes and the increased storage of fat adequate exercise counteracts this as the net calories do not increase but combined with inactivity will cause weight gain in fact most artificial sweeteners have more serious health risks saccharin pink causes cancer in larger doses not proven in humans aspartame blue causes intense pain for those born with phenylketonuria very rare though i have met and breaks down into several poisons including formaldehyde sucralose yellow actually has more calories than sugar though the body cannot absorb it easily if an intestinal bacteria ever figures out how to convert it to sugar it will become the next aspartame then there are sugar alcohols for the most part they are natural extracts that do not have as many calories as sugar i doubt there are serious health risks but some are used as laxatives for a reason  Milk Dieting Obesity Healthy eating Breastfeeding Diabetes mellitus Insulin Hypoglycemia Sugar Low-carbohydrate diet Saccharin Veganism Coffee Alcoholic beverage Tocopherol Hamster Dietary fiber Coca-Cola Folic acid Chronic fatigue syndrome Tea Poison Vegetarianism The Coca-Cola Company Food Vitamin C Anorexia nervosa 7 Up Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Mountain Dew Cancer Fecal incontinence Tooth enamel Calorie restriction Crohn's disease Cocaine Diet Coke Word of Wisdom Biochemistry Raw food diet Foodborne illness Growth hormone treatment Paracetamol Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Carbon dioxide Cheese Weight loss Glycemic index Mosquito Prostate cancer Ice cream Urolagnia Diarrhea Insulin resistance Colorectal cancer Alcohol fuel Addiction Alcohol consumption and health Swimming Xylitol Hyperglycemia Pneumonia Stomach cancer Vitamin Hypertension Polycystic ovary syndrome Alcohol Soy milk Junk food Glycogen storage disease type I Animal testing Glucokinase Clinical depression Vegetarian nutrition Dr Pepper Methamphetamine Enzyme Chlorpromazine Aloe Carnivorous plant Sucrose Glycerin Super Size Me

brita health risks is it true that brita water purification can pose health hazards from these tiny carbon particles is it otherwise ok to use it thanks there's no health risk from the activated carbon unless you accidently inhale them any small particles when inhaled can cause inflammatory pneumonia the activated carbon is in the brita filter to soak up any organic solvents that might be in your water if you digest the carbon you release those organic solvents again but you're in no worse shape than if you drank that polluted water in the first place the biggest problem with the brita water purification system is that it's a water purification system it can remove stuff from the water you drink and make it less unpalatable however most municipal water is surface water water from reservoirs lakes and rivers it comes from the sky where air pollution makes it unhealthy and then runoff from parking lots and discharge from factory and residential sewers can taint it not to mention what fish do in water water that comes from springs and wells is mineral water the minerals make the water tastier and the water does a better job of quenching your thirst it's possible to add minerals to purified surface water to accomplish the same ends coke dasani and pepsi aquafina both try to do that however they add a limited number of minerals compared to the much longer list of minerals in most spring water and there is always the problem of manufacturing error coke has repeatedly had recalls of dasani water because it was unsafe to drink while brita isn't a health risk it still is a way of treating municipal surface water it doesn't give you the benefits of drinking spring well or mineral water in the first place  Sewage treatment Water Water purification Carbon dioxide Pollution Eutrophication Water pollution Water resources Air pollution Environmental engineering Particulate Coal Bong Nuclear power Hydrogen sulfide Environmental concerns with electricity generation Carbon dioxide sink Coffee Bottled water Dry cleaning Asbestos Dairy Haloalkane Solvent Cocaine Acetic acid Iron Soft drink Lake Hamster Industrial wastewater treatment Ammonia Mesothelioma Drowning Nuclear fallout Desert Groundwater Grand Calumet River The Coca-Cola Company Energy development Essentuki Steel Mineral Sulfuric acid Fish farming Fountain Town gas Explosive material Sewer Gasoline Water (molecule) Helium Omega-3 fatty acid Motor oil Dioxin Sodium hypochlorite Nutrient Nuclear fission Beryllium Plutonium Motorcycle Waste management Hard water Health insurance Liquid breathing Alkane Rebreather Brewery Water supply Elis Prefecture Effects of global warming Fire extinguisher Wastewater Geyser Depleted uranium Fossil fuel power plant Pepsi-Cola Nuclear reactor Tobacco smoking Cholesterol Industrial process Medicine Knife Folic acid Storm water Ecology of Hong Kong Silicon Biodiesel Ultraviolet Alcohol Alternative biochemistry Natural gas

fake frappuccino recipes i am looking for a recipe to make an imitation orange creme frappuccino and any other recipes for imitation fraps would be greatly appreciated thanks the first step to making a frappuccino is buying high quality coffee you can buy authentic starbucks coffee or you can shop around for less expensive coffee if you really want to save some money if you can you should buy the coffee beans the coffee beans are not only less expensive but fresh ground coffee will make your frappuccino taste even better once you have your fresh ground coffee it's time to start brewing frappuccinos use double strength coffee to give it an added kick this means that to make a frappuccino you have to measure two tablespoons of ground coffee per serving in your coffee maker once the coffee has been brewed chill it in the refrigerator it works best if you brew the coffee the night before so that you will have your frappuccino the next morning now that you have your chilled coffee add three tablespoons of granulated sugar one cup of milk low fat or skim milk works fine and two cups of ice in a blender these measurements assume you are making two grande frappuccinos if you are making more or less please adjust the measurements accordingly blend the ingredients together on high speed until the ice is crushed and the drink is smooth pour the frappuccinos into two ounce glasses and enjoy caramel and mocha frappuccinos if you want a caramel or mocha frappuccino just add three tablespoons of caramel topping or three tablespoons of chocolate syrup or orange cream yogurt oz that's all it takes to make your own frappuccino  Chocolate Espresso Tea Milk Breakfast Starbucks Kit Kat Milkshake Tofu Dairy Cold Stone Creamery Mayonnaise Turkish coffee Cheese Mai Tai Cuisine of Denmark Yoghurt Japanese cuisine Bubble tea Chili con carne Maple syrup Muesli Instant coffee Bread Champagne (beverage) Sake Cha chaan teng Oreo Drink Martini cocktail Cuisine of Malaysia Hong Kong-style milk tea Russian cuisine Cooking weights and measures Ramen Vegetarian cuisine Vinegar German cuisine Cinnabon Brewery Cuisine of Singapore Wine Pancake Cajun cuisine Beer Sugar Mooncake Caffeine Cake Brewing Heath bar Food Soup Cider Soy protein Rice pudding Curry Olive oil French cuisine Moonshine Gatorade Soy sauce Cheesecake Coffeehouse Apple pie Coffea Cream (food) Guinness Questionable Content Bengali cuisine Alcoholic beverage Gelato Jewish cuisine Scotch whisky Indian filter coffee Tortilla McDonald's Cuisine of Brazil Dairy product Barbecue Cappuccino Peruvian cuisine Hamburger Stout beer Twix Ketchup Sangr__a Chicken soup Cadbury Schweppes Lactose intolerance

for people in nyc when you buy milk why does the expiration date always list nyc as a few days before everywhere else example sell by except in nyc sell by and it really always seems to rot by the nyc date what if i buy it in nyc on and take it across to nj will it not expire then regulations to account for the extra time they are left out of refrigeration new york city milk expires sooner because the difficulty of delivering milk in the city means that the average milk carton is unrefrigerated sitting on the sidewalk or in a truck for longer than the average milk carton outside the city which is usually delivered directly to a loading dock in a supermarket  Milk Dairy MetroCard Refrigerator car Tofu Organic food Shelf life Pasteurization Ice cream Tetra Pak Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934 Soy milk Cigarette New York City Mass transit in New York City Stock car (rail) Vitasoy Breastfeeding Northeast Corridor 4-6-4 New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad Condensed milk Genericized trademark Hong Kong-style milk tea Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Refrigerator John Lindsay Conrail NYC Hudson New York City Subway accessibility Dairy farming Copyright law of the United Kingdom Steam (content delivery) IBM PC compatible Tesco Short selling Delivery (commerce) A-C (New York City Subway service) Option US and Canadian license plates Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Mad Money Futures contract Namsos campaign Harlem Yoghurt Pulaski Skyway New York New York City Police Department Married... with Children Coconut milk Planned obsolescence Domain Name System Supermarket Carton Virgin Mobile Lechaina Alcoholic beverage Mack Trucks Leasing Pretty Good Privacy AT&T Chocolate Dairy cattle Citigroup Sugar beet Bus models used in New York City Transit Appeal New York City Transit Authority New York City Subway Harvey Milk Kosher foods Butter City Island, Bronx, New York Animal Liberation Front Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious Leeds United F.C.

do you think sales of aquafina and other purifed drinks will plummet since they'll be labeled from public water sources i personally don't think they will since people don't really read labels the new stories might however what do you think i think it might because many people prefer to have clean water aquafina and dasani are sometimes overpriced and you might as well drink tap water because it's actually the same as a and d i usually prefer poland spring because its from a natural spring however it is a blow to a and d's companies because during a campaign to limit bottled water they were exposed as merely tap water which any average home has acess to next time the public should chose a clean source and not focus on the fancy labels or bottles  Dasani Bottled water Water Water resources The Coca-Cola Company Tap water Water purification New Coke Drink Beer Bong Surveillance Coca-Cola The Apprentice 2 Inca Kola Alcoholic beverage Soft drink Diamond Champagne (beverage) PepsiCo, Inc.

coffee drinkers read i drink coffee every single day and i find that when i don't drink it i can't crap until i get some coffee in my system is this bad interesting but not bad caffeine combines with stomach acid and forms a toxin caffeine hydrochloride as this toxin hits your liver bile is released in an attempt to flush the toxin from your system which in turn causes bowel movements so what you might be experiencing is your body has gotten used to this regularity so when you don't drink coffee it doesn't follow this process anymore it's not necessarily bad but does mean you are addicted to caffeine and coffee so you have to decide if that's okay if it really bothers you a way to get your body back to normal is to take some laxatives while you're getting off the coffee and eventually your body will return to how it should normally operate be careful not to become too reliant on the laxatives too  Caffeine Fecal incontinence Coffee Cirrhosis Vomiting Word of Wisdom Drug addiction Coca-Cola Yerba mate Digestion Hypoglycemia Hangover Alcoholism Tea Alcoholics Anonymous Urinary incontinence Vitamin C Foodborne illness Hepatitis Diarrhea Addiction Gastroesophageal reflux disease Friends Insomnia Blood alcohol content Carbon dioxide Theory of conduct Sleep Poison Energy drink Craps Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Chocolate Breastfeeding Futurama (TV series - season 2) Coffea arabica Liver dialysis Gallstone Mountain Dew Iggy Pop Endometriosis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Healthy eating Crohn's disease Hemorrhoid Minor Discworld concepts Cocaine Red Bull Liver Blood The Wildhearts One Tree Hill (TV series) Irritable bowel syndrome Illegal drug trade Parkinson's disease Anthrax Laxative Breakfast Oxycodone Coffea Avenue Q Wilson's disease Decaffeination Taurine Brian Griffin The Wack Pack The Clash Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Antibody Traditional Chinese medicine Stomach cancer Pneumonia New York City Subway nomenclature Instant coffee Fasting Poker jargon Coffee and Cigarettes Pancreas Cancer Buprenorphine Social rule Gastrointestinal tract Raw food diet Smallville (Season 4) Opioid The Curse of Fenric Guilty Gear Everwood Bile Blackjack Sin City Prostate cancer LSD The O.C.

is it difficult if i wanted to start my own beverage company is it difficult if i wanted to start my own beverage company any other related comments or suggestions it's pretty easy to start a beverage company you can start off small which is pretty difficult for say a steel mill you also have high margins to work with which is not true for say a steel mill you turn your product over pretty quickly which is not true for say a steel mill however if you think you can get shelf space in supermarkets and have an instant hit you're crazy you have to rent the space on supermarket shelves and you have to work hard to get consumers to try your product out fifty years ago most soft drink bottlers had a major brand and a minor brand the pepsi bottler would have another brand say suncrest or nehi that made fruit flavored drinks in the s and s the variety of brands that pepsi and coke offered really blossomed and what happened was that cherry and grape and orange pop in these minor brand was replaced with diet and caffeine free colas fifty years ago most drug stores had a soda fountain as well it's hard to find anyplace that you can get a soda these days i think someone could open up a soda fountain store and do well make your own premium ice cream in the back much like graeter's does very successfully in cincinnati set up a soda fountain that offers lots of fruit flavors the minor pop brands mostly sold out to monarch nugrape and you wouldn't have to develop your own flavors you could buy the syrups from them then you set up a bottling plant and sell pop to your customers by the case as well as by the glass the idea isn't to be the cheapest pop in town but when the convenience store across the street cuts their price on ounce pack of pepsi to for you match their price exactly you don't want to get in any price wars you're not going to sell a million bottles of pop out of that store initially but it gets your name before the community when you open five more fountains around the city you won't need to buy any more ice cream freezers or bottling equipment because the mother store will have enough capacity to handle it once you get the city saturated with your fountains you start approaching all the convenience stores to sell your pop this isn't as great a stretch as you might think here in lancaster pennsylvania the leading convenience store is turkey hill but most of the other convenience stores have big signs out front this week offering turkey hill ice cream at for if they aren't offering deals on th ice cream it's th drinks in gallons convenience stores are not religious mosques they are happy to sell what consumers are eager to buy you can approach the warehouse stores like costco as well they aren't pushovers by any means but they are very open to new manufacturers much more so than supermarkets generally you start off sampling your product if consumers like it and buy it then you may have a permanent place in their stores coast to coast the important thing to remember is that you're out to maximize profit not maximize gallonage and not to maximize the profits of companies selling advertising giving away samples is a good way to get people to try your product maybe it makes sense to buy an ice cream truck and load it full of coolers instead ice cream and drive around neighborhoods slowly with the tune running selling your drink just so you get some free publicity on tv put the truck in every parade in the area and have some kids in distinctive outfits pass out some ice cold drinks to people along the parade route partly as sampling and partly for the wow factor they better be ice cold though warm drinks are going to go over like a thud work out a deal with some popular charity so they man the truck at a street fair selling pop for c or for either very cheap or very high so people notice with signs pointing out that of the money goes to that charity there are good margins in beverages and there is good demand and it's far far easier to do this today in an era when people expect plastic bottles than it was when pop came in cans or in glass bottles will pepsi and coke notice sure will they compete with you sure will they drop their prices below cost in order to kill you off well they didn't do that when jolt snapple vitamin water and other new companies appeared be aware that a successful beverage company is going to be valuable and you will end up investing a lot of money and a lot of effort to make your new company succeed but if you have a good idea and the energy and skills to make a small business succeed it could be a very good investment  The Apprentice 2 Bulk vending Diet soda Wine Tesco Illegal drug trade Gatorade Fanta Costco Inca Kola Wal-Mart McDonald's

is monster energy drink bad for you can i drink it during a hockey would it help me will it slow me down don't say drink water most energy drinks have a few of these ingredients caffeine taurine creatine l carnitine guarana ginseng guanine sugar most of these are organic compounds that work together to give you a slight boost in energy when you mix these with sugar and caffeine you get a bigger boost but you can look at these ingredients as drugs of a sort the upside is that you will get some energy and feel good for a short time the downside is that the energy isn't going to last long certainly not for a whole hockey match and drinking alot of it can mess with your sleep cycles plus a ton of other stuff that they don't mention on the can my advice once in a while an energy drink probably isn't the end of the world it might boost your energy up a bit for when you need it just be ready for a crash or a late night if you are sensitive to caffeine look at the labels of the drinks before you buy them they are not all the same i would recommend getting the sugar free ones because drinking alot of sugary drinks is a great way to get a first class ticket to diabetic ville just be careful it's your body so only put in it what you want hope this helps  Energy drink Caffeine Red Bull Mountain Dew Breastfeeding SoBe Insomnia Coffee Hypoglycemia Urinary incontinence Word of Wisdom Sugar substitute Chocolate Alcoholic beverage Carbon dioxide Nutrition Water Weight training Jolt Cola Soft drink Yerba mate Biochemistry Atkins Nutritional Approach YuYu Hakusho Healthy eating Internal ballistics Theory of conduct Sleep Social rule Avenue Q Shit The Ashlee Simpson Show Breakfast Cocaine Rum Bodybuilding Poker jargon The Catcher in the Rye Bipolar disorder Wine Tea Veganism Shaggy dog story Creatine Explosive material Erectile dysfunction House music Characters in the Smurfs Phosphoric acid Hangover Single malt Scotch Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Diabetes mellitus Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Brewery Conker's Bad Fur Day Waylon Jennings Great Teacher Onizuka Irn-Bru Obesity Hypertension Chronic fatigue syndrome Coca-Cola Dieting Electrolyte Ron and Fez Humphrey Bogart Turbocharger Cocktail Traditional Chinese medicine First aid Traumatic incident reduction Hyperglycemia Professional wrestling slang Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Heinkel He 100 Malaria Pitaten Barq's Chinese food therapy The Wildhearts Sugar beet Portland cement Blood (computer game) Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Sewage treatment Origin of life Gasoline Stanley Cup Vivian Stanshall Sucrose Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Antiretroviral drug Psoriasis

why is snapple tea so inconsistent in flavor i like lemon snapple tea but in tastes lousy why is that have these people not heard of quality control is it perhaps produced on east coast and changes in transit en route to wc does it change as it ages short shelf life often when it tastes bad a lot of sediment is in bottom sometimes not often when safeway has a sale well you guessed it what's up with snapple inconsistency it could be all of those things you mentioned but i think that primarily it's the batch of tea that they use tea leaves are not a chemical so each batch will not be the same the leaves could have been dried differently from a different region of the world from a different blend etc to add to this the brewing process at snapple if they do brew it could be different the temp of the water the length of steeping the tea leaves could be different the best thing to do is to brew your own tea and put it over ice and add sugar sugar is not the same as high fructose corn syrup  Tea Coffee Brewery Beer Rum Honey Snapple Homebrewing Sugar Green tea Soft drink Bread Cuisine of the Philippines Black tea Sugar beet Herbal tea Oolong Lemonade Yerba mate Rooibos Corn syrup Diet soda Coca-Cola Alcoholic beverage Brewing New Coke Sprite (soft drink) Gatorade White tea Sweet tea Tofu Fujian tea ceremony Lemon Horehound Chinese tea culture Hop (plant) Maple syrup Illegal drug trade Cider Scotch whisky Carbon dioxide Ice cream Tequila Ayahuasca Teapot Peruvian cuisine Gin Sewage treatment Cheese Vitasoy Soy sauce Food preservation Japanese tea ceremony Tea bag Cigar Cha chaan teng Coffea Cuisine of Malaysia Wheat beer Starch Samovar Cuisine of the Southern United States Cajun cuisine Biochemistry Cuisine of Singapore Pu-erh tea Date Palm Golden syrup Vinegar Erosion Ethanol Hong Kong tea culture Jewish cuisine Tea Classics Japanese cuisine Kit Kat Yoghurt German cuisine Cuisine of Argentina Cantonese cuisine Mead Cigarette Miller Brewing Agriculture Cinnamon Bengali cuisine Single malt Scotch Cocaine Lambic Stout beer Shochu

is coffee bad for your skin yes or no bad skin is not generally caused by any one food unless it is an allergic reaction but particular foods can aggravate poor skin the myth that chocolate sweets and other fatty and sugary foods cause spots is not entirely unfounded an eating pattern high in these foods and low in fresh vegetables and other constituents of a healthy diet means that your skin is unlikely to be getting all the nutrients it needs women who would rather eat a bar of chocolate or a bag of crisps than an orange for example may lack vitamin c this can make your immune system less able to fight infections including those on the skin spots in addition women often eat more chocolate at times when they are feeling down whether emotionally hormonally or physically which also has a negative effect on the skin if you already have spots a diet that is high in sugar or fat may make your system even more susceptible to bacterial infections which may further aggravate spots and other skin conditions drink plenty of water in our society where many of us have central heating and lead active lives one of the commonest causes of tired looking skin is dehydration both on the surface and throughout the body aim to re hydrate your body by drinking two to three litres four to five pints of water a day this should ideally be taken as plain or lightly flavoured unsweetened water and not tea coffee or other caffeine containing or sugary drinks cut down on tea and coffee women who drink a lot of tea coffee hot chocolate and cola type drinks are more likely to have tired looking skin and to suffer from conditions such as greasy skin and spots this is because these drinks contain caffeine which prevents your body from making good use of the vitamins and minerals from your food try to drink no more than three cups of coffee tea or other caffeine containing drinks a day  Milk Coffee Caffeine Chocolate Tea Fecal incontinence Tooth Urinary incontinence Breakfast Tocopherol Dieting Healthy eating Food Breastfeeding Common cold Insulin Veganism Soft drink Vitamin C Acne Folic acid Hyperthermia Psoriasis Omega-3 fatty acid Dehydration Diabetes mellitus Word of Wisdom Chronic fatigue syndrome Obesity Vitamin Crohn's disease Raw food diet Insomnia Vegetarianism Bodybuilding Garlic Domestic rabbit Coeliac disease Sugar Yoghurt Cancer Sleep Hamster Yerba mate Bread Vegetarian nutrition Water Human skin color Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Egg (food) Guinea pig Hangover Flavonoid Gout Nutrient Tattoo Energy drink Coca-Cola Protein-energy malnutrition Anorexia nervosa Skin Vitamin D Ramen Herpes simplex virus Tooth enamel Allergy Kit Kat Cuisine of Denmark Scar Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cuisine of the Philippines Hyperglycemia Japanese tea ceremony Osteoporosis Multiple sclerosis Cheese Hiking Antioxidant Rooibos Dairy Stomach cancer Colorectal cancer Coffeehouse Soy milk Immune system Decompression sickness Dietary fiber
