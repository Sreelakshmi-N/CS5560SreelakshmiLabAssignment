where did the phrase holy cow com from i've always wondered that but never could figure it out one key to appreciating this expression whatever its precise origin is to appreciate that the use of cow is not meant terribly seriously but as an odd or silly or at least harmless idea so for starters let's not get confused the expression holy cow is not the equivalent of the idiom sacred cow though i won't completely dismiss the notion that it might have some connection http idioms thefreedictionary com cow the word cow may be totally arbitrary but seeing that it starts with a c it may well be that it began as a minced oath a milder substitute for holy christ such expressions frequently use a harmless or even meaningless substitute including some of the same sounds esp beginning with the same sounds cf jeepers creepers jees jiminy cricket and judas priest for jesus christ also gosh darn heck 'the dickens' for 'the devil' etc there is actually quite a bit of discussion of this and similar expressions on the internet the following is my gleanings of the best of it first note that holy cow is one of a number of relatively recent and specifically american expressions beginning holy the dates several of these are first attested in print holy smoke holy cats holy mackerel both holy moses holy cow from i hear america talking by stuart berg flexner von nostrand reinhold co new york http www phrases org uk bulletin board messages html of this whole group the american heritage dictionary of idioms writes 'holy cow ' 'holy mackerel' or 'moses' or 'moly' or 'smoke ' an exclamation of surprise astonishment delight or dismay as in holy cow i forgot the wine or holy mackerel you won or holy moses here comes the teacher or holy smoke i didn't know you were here too the oldest of these slangy expletives uses mackerel dating from about the one with 'moses' dates from about and 'cow' from about none has any literal significance and moly is a neologism devised to rhyme with holy and possibly a euphemism for moses http www wordwizard com ch forum topic asp topic id compare the following on holy smoke it seems more likely that holy smoke was invented anew as a mock religious exclamation and mild oath on the model of the older holy moses from the s and holy terror and holy joe both from the s in turn these probably served as the model for others of similar type that came later such as holy cow from the early s http www worldwidewords org qa qa hol htm note that date for the first printed attestation of holy cow early s this does not necessarily mean that was it's first use but it apparently is much later than many of the others but it does suggest that it might not be so closely connected with the th century forms rather it might be part of a wave of mid th century expressions of this type esp in popular media comic books tv movies on these note the following from the dictionary of american slang holy cow equiv to holy cats both being euphemisms for holy christ the common oath and popular exclam put into the mouth of teenagers by all script writers universally heard on radio television and in movies it was first popularized by the corliss archer series of short stories television programs and movies which attempted to show the humorous homey side of teenage life paul beale however in revising eric partridge's dictionary of catch phrases american and british cites a different origin the orig 'captain marvel' and 'batman' oaths 'holy something harmless ' were in turn spoofed in later c by whatever seemed relevant to the situation nigel rees in very interesting but stupid catchphrases from the world of entertainment instances holy flypaper holy cow holy felony holy geography holy schizophrenia holy haberdashery etc and adds 'the prefix 'holy' to any exclamation was particularly the province of batman and his boy assistant robin characters created by bob kane and featured in best selling comic books for over thirty years before they were portrayed by adam west and burt ward in the tv film series ' http www phrases org uk bulletin board messages html since all of this was done as silliness it's possible the notion was suggested by the hindus sacred cow base on the idea that a cow itself is a rather silly thing to be regarded holy sacred at any rate the idea seems to be that the word is supposed to refer to something harmless which also applies if it was chosen as a substitute for christ one remotely possible parallel my own idea i will toss in the early th century expression 'holy mackerel' was apparently related to the expression 'mackerel snappers' a mock term of derision used against catholics immigrants this was based on their eating fish on friday why mackerels it may be influenced by the fact that mackerels are very cheap what these immigrants could afford and not highly regarded but mackerel may also have been influenced by the sound of michael name of the archangel http www takeourword com tow page html though it was originally derisive there may again be the idea of silliness viz the notion that a fish esp the mackerel is rather a silly thing to be regarded as holy now though they are not close in time perhaps it's worth considering the possibility that holy cow had some derogatory notion behind it an extension of the use of cow as an insulting term for a woman regarded as fat ugly slovenly contemptible or silly http www peevish co uk slang c htm http dictionary reference com search q cow http en wiktionary org wiki cow  Shit Australian words Bible Uniform

were does the ok come from there have been numerous attempts to explain the emergence of this curious colloquial expression which seems to have swept into popular use in the us during the mid th century most of them are undoubtedly pure speculation it does not seem at all likely from the linguistic and historical evidence that it derives from the scots expression 'och aye' the greek ola kala 'it is good' the choctaw indian oke or okeh 'it is so' the french aux cayes 'from cayes' a port in haiti with a reputation for good rum or au quai 'to the quay' as supposedly used by french speaking dockers or the initials of a railway freight agent called obediah kelly who is said to have written them on lading documents he had checked the oldest written references to 'ok' result from its adoption as a slogan by the democratic party during the american presidential election of their candidate president martin van buren was nicknamed 'old kinderhook' after his birthplace in new york state and his supporters formed the 'ok club' this undoubtedly helped to popularize the term though it did not get president van buren re elected during the late s there had been a brief but widespread craze in the us for humorous misspellings and the form orl korrekt which was among them could explain the initials 'ok' such a theory has been supported by more than one distinguished american scholar and is given in many dictionaries including oxford dictionaries the only other theory with at least a degree of plausibility is that the term originated among black slaves of west african origin and represents a word meaning 'all right yes indeed' in various west african languages unfortunately historical evidence enabling the origin of this expression to be finally and firmly established may be hard to unearth  President of the United States James K.

side it is true and that should count for something everyone in the contintental united states must know by now how enamored i am with u s marshal matt dillon james arness of gunsmoke fame i write about him all the time on ya in my stories miss kitty has been replaced by my literary counterpart sunshine macgillicutty i have several neighbors who try to keep up with the fictional doings in dodge as a matter of fact it seems that wherever i go the subject comes up usually by me by the time i leave wherever i've been another person has been made aware of that wonderful show gunsmoke and the stories i write although i never tell them which site i participate on nor do i tell them my code name i spend hours on ya i am not one to frequent the questions that ask about my favorite color or when was the last time i had sex the answer to that is so pathetic it would only illicit email of pity the funny thing is up until a year ago i swore i'd never get a computer and now well now it is as much a part of my life as my visits to the physical therapist is there a connection there hmmmmmmm good question you might say i am torn between two lovers marshal dillon and the computer more specifically ya okay now i'll get to it today at pm the greatest episode in the history of tv was on it was entitled matt's love story although i have seen it several times it still brings me to the brink of no not that but it does bring me to the brink of the cut off zone separating sanity and insanity i was totally poised i had a brand new tape in the vcr i closed my curtains so the light from outside would not dance across the screen also i wanted nobody to know i was home if anyone had knocked on my door i would not have answered the show began i was laying on the couch victor french whose acting is top notch was just about to shoot matt bang down went matt he is eventully rescued by the luckiest actress that ever lived michael learned she nurses matt back to health and soon learns he has amnesia now this is very interesting matt behaves totally different with her than he ever behaved with miss kitty he is frisky sexy dear gawd he is sexy and very suggestive and romantic did you know that when this first aired many years ago it caused a huge stink it's true many people thought it dirtied the image of matt the idiots anyway you could tell matt and the woman were falling in love at each commercial i would end the taping and run back to my computer room then after a few minutes of long commercials i would run back to the couch usually in a new york second well just before the big kissing scene was to take place i was typing madly at my keyboard this time the commercial break was tiny i heard the love music begin i screamed and ran down the hall run faster i yelled to myself i ran so fast that i slipped on a rug in the hall somehow i managed not to fall i knew the big scene was moments away the back of the couch was facing me i had no idea where the remote was i knew that time was of the essence ohhhhh did i tell you there is a small table at the back of the couch and remember i currently go to the physical therapy office twice a week it must really be helping because i literally dove over the table clearing several picture frames before landing on the couch even as i was airborne i frantically looked for the remote who took the remote i screamed out as i live alone it is unlikely that it could be anywhere other than where i had left it minutes earlier success i clicked on the vcr the taping resumed and then the electricity went out i sat there stunned i feel my ulcer growing i cried as i pleaded to god to please turn the power back on i hit the button all was well thank god by the time matt joined his love interest in the bedroom i was in hormone heaven i smiled like a fool as he quietly joined her for a night of love making when the show was over i lay there hugging a pillow which may never regain it's original form the desperate dive i had negociated in combination with the range of emotions i had experienced had taken their toll where's my aspirin i muttered as i got up and started back to the computer room a thought entered my very weary mind i have got to get a life  The Amber Spyglass Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Miss Saigon One Tree Hill (TV series) Little Britain

difference between sorrow and misery habit and groove there must be some difference can you describe for me sorrow vs misery habit vs groove sorrow is usually something one feels about a particular event like a bereavement or the loss of something valuable also doing or saying something dumb can lead to sorrow provided you realise what you have done or said misery however is a more general mood and doesn't need to be directed at anything lots of things can contribute to making you miserable kids going through puberty are often miserable but can rarely explain why it's just a general malaise a habit or habitual behaviour is usually carried out without thinking biting one's nails lighting a cigarette doodling these things are often done whilst thinking about or doing something else it's a subconscious act a groove if i am to get your link to habitual behaviour is more likely to be a repetitive occurrence a set course or action that doesn't deviate it could be completely intentional like a winning streak in las vegas or catching lots of fish one after the other you are in a groove you might say that lots of sorrowful things happening could put you in a miserable groove time to develop positive habits and cheer up apologies for english spellings  Procrastination Spanish verbs Unconscious mind Determinism English verbs Grammatical aspect Alexander Technique Milton H.

how about a little story tht includes these lines okay i'm just a stupid cupid youth is wasted on the young i am your singer did you read the dang directions i can't stop smiling hee haw and away we go if you wish to answer please post your intent so i won't close on you ouch actually i don t know if i can use all of the lines you provided but i wanted to share a story anyway one of these lines reminded me of it thank god you didn't close at about o clock on morning of september my wife sarah began complaining of cramping in her abdomen that radiated toward her back it was the second time she d had that feeling in the last minutes she was due on september nine months pregnant oh great i said jokingly right when we re about to go to bed sarah replied with a half smile as if to say i can t help it i went upstairs and grabbed the stopwatch which was apparently still running since the false alarm we had earlier in the week i can t figure out how to reset it we ll just have to time the next one did you read the dang directions she snapped nevermind i got it wait strike that i just began another lap i pressed two more buttons there we go are you still having a contraction she shook her hand side to side as she exhaled a few seconds go by okay it s done i began the timer the last two were estimated to be at fifteen minutes apart we wait both of us with the same expression of fear excitement and worry on our face seven minutes later she has another contraction oh my god this is it seven minutes i can t believe it i mean no doubt he s ready to come out but i m going to bring the stuff out to the car do you need some water should i bring the tennis balls my bathing suit how about the pilates ball all this is stuff was recommended during our childbirth class as items that might come in handy during delivery ignoring the fact that it was recommended for natural delivery and she was planning on getting an epidural the next contraction didn t come for ten minutes and for the next hour they fluxuated between and minutes she decided she should get some rest i was too excited for rest so i went outside and looked at the stars the sky was very clear as i gazed up i saw two satellites pass overhead and the red streak of a meteor an hour later i went up to our room and curled up in bed she had filled out the rest of the steno pad we used to keep track of the contractions it s about am we both laid quietly in bed hoping to catch some sleep before it was time to leave after minutes she breaks the silence are you awake yes i answered i can t stop smiling the next thing i remember sarah is shaking my shoulder they ve been minutes apart for the past hour what i exclaimed that s more than the legal limit you should ve woken me it was am i stumble drunkenly out of bed brush my teeth call labor delivery give them the heads up slip on my shoes grab a quick bite to eat hee haw and away we go i remember the drive there better than anything it was cool crisp the sun was rising there was a blue tint to the air can we listen to music she asked what what did you marry me for i am your singer i proclaimed which i punctuate with happy birthday in a operatic baritone voice happy birthday dear jackson happy birthday to yoooooou she rolls her eyes at me as she scrolls through the ipod menu hits play and sets the white rectangular hunk on the dashboard still in lounge singer mode thank you very much i will be your labor coach so if you have any questions i point my finger gun at her and click my tongue twice i was seriously lacking sleep little did i know it was hours and minutes later at am on sunday september that jackson was delivered by c section hrs and minutes after contractions first started hours since either of us had a full nights sleep he was crying but it sounded more like screaming the nurse michelle who had become very familiar with us throughout the day brought him over to us held him near sarah's face for a few seconds and took him away again things got fuzzy from there i remember wheeling him toward a processing area where he was going to be weighed measured certified as having been born and fitted with an electronic bracelet my mother was waiting by the nurses station just outside the processing area she came up to the cart and looked at him in awe can i hold him she asked is it okay to hold him i haven't even gotten to hold him yet and neither has sarah i knew sarah didn't want anybody to hold him before her except me yes by all means replied one of the nurses regrettably i don't remember actually holding him then but i know i did we finished the trip to the processing area when michelle took him to get his weight the wednesday prior when we were at the hospital because we thought sarah's water had broken the doctor did an ultrasound and gave us an estimate of his weight the estimate was about pounds the estimate was a surprise to us both since we are both smaller in stature michelle put him on the digital scale and i watched the numbers on the digital readout skip up to back down to the ounces skipped around for a bit and finally settled on a number pounds ounces michelle announced holy crap oh my god seriously what the heck jackson you're such a big guy oh my god shortly after that sarah came lumbering in on a gurney but she was out of it not only was she all doped up on anaesthesia and pain killers but she had been up for hours the baby was placed on her belly and she tried breastfeeding him that went ok minutes later we were in the room we'd stay in for the next days no lights except one over jackson's head nurses were getting sarah situated in her bed and jackson just stared right in the direction of our voices during the commotion no expression on his face he just stared he stared even after the nurses left but it was am and sarah and i were both too tired to safely pick up the baby we'd waited months to hold it was a heartbreaking decision to make but we had to ask the nurse to take him to the nursery for the night once the last strand of our newborn son's hair had disappeared from view we slept this story continues up to this moment so i think i'll just stop there and just say i'm just a stupid cupid and youth is wasted on the young fell victim to writers block  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban 1957 World Series Russian joke Father's Day (Doctor Who)

what is a legitimate question i have heard people ask other people questions and htey said its a legitimate question what does legitimate mean can someone use it in a sentence for me please describe clearly thanks the word legitimate has several meanings depending on the context as quark has shown you but i'm not sure this answers your question about the term legitimate question usually the term legitimate question comes up in a conversation that is more of a debate the individuals are discussing some topic and one of them challenges something the other has said by asking a question the question usually requires an answer that makes the other person have to defend their point or perspective if the question asked is truly relevant to the topic of debate then the person who has been called upon to answer the question might acknowledge the appropriateness of the question by saying that's a legitimate question this phrase is often used to set someone up for a good answer that will follow by telling the asker their question is legitimate you give them the sense they have scored a point in the debate or discussion but then when you have a good answer to their question you pull the rug out from under them for example let's say we were discussing the war in iraq i might contend that we need to stay there until order is restored you might ask if we continue to keep troops there won't thousands of more soldiers be killed in truth that is a legitimate question because as long as we do stay in iraq more soldiers will be killed but the world has been fighting wars for freedom for centuries hundreds of thousands of people have given their lives so others could be free and if we leave iraq too soon it is likely that many many more people will die if the country falls into a protracted civil war in this example about the war in iraq if you had asked me to explain why sadaam hussein was found in a spider hole that would not be a legitimate question to our discussion because the question has nothing to do with the issue of whether we should stay in iraq or not does that help  Democracy Philosophy of language Plame affair Iraq War Socialism Scientology beliefs and practices Resurrection of Jesus Fahrenheit 9/11 Civil rights Intelligent design movement English grammar Freedom of speech Non-aggression principle Post-invasion Iraq, 2003___2005 Goodness and value theory Amnesty International Predestination Cultural relativism State Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Who is a Jew?

why no is the short form for number snoopy l has the basics the word is the first and last letter of the latin form numero which is the ablative case form of the word meaning in number it is also true as some note that abbreviations are often enough formed by the first letter some other besides the second letter esp using the last letter as with mr mister or vb verb though also sometimes another distinctive letter e g mt for mountain but note that in all of these cases the abbreviations use letters from the word's english root word not some changeable ending and it's not just that the abbreviation is of a latin word english nouns of course do not have case endings there are many abbreviations of latin words used in english and other languages which do not include case endings so why is this abbreviation formed this way the point was that this abbreviation stems a from a time when scholars wrote in latin so case endings would be used throughout the writing b from a word used in sentences where it could be important to know exactly how the word was being used that is its case as another has noticed though apparently misunderstood in its original form no had a raised superscript underlined o this special treatment was used to clearly indicate that this o was a case ending and not part of the root word related note the practice of abbreviating a word by its first letter or two plus the case ending usually raised is ancient for example in the early church by the nd century copies of the greek new testament would abbreviate the divine names by using the first letter or two followed by the case ending with a line over the whole to mark it as an abbreviation http www skypoint com waltzmn nominasacra html  Latin Tetragrammaton Diacritic Proto-Indo-European language Ancient Greek Umlaut Latin declension Slovak language Names of God in Judaism Tamil language Inflection Gothic language Kanji Bulgarian language English plural Hangul Apostrophe (mark) Finnish grammar Preposition Ablaut Sanskrit Latin alphabet International Phonetic Alphabet Morphology (linguistics) Hebrew language English grammar Exponentiation Binomial nomenclature Arabic grammar Grammatical gender Romanian language Copula Serbo-Croatian language Vocative case Hebrew alphabet Hungarian language New Testament American and British English differences Korean language Capitalization Jehovah Egyptian language Esperanto orthography Cyrillic alphabet Vulgar Latin Ligature (typography) Quenya German grammar Bible Braille Taiwanese (linguistics) Collation Greek alphabet Varieties of Arabic Grammatical number Chinese language Alphabet Vowel Grammatical aspect Sesotho language Old French Part of speech Danish language Spanish language Finnish language E Noun Names of numbers in English English verbs Acute accent Apocrypha Lithuanian language Shorthand Abbreviation Dutch language Tone (linguistics) D'ni language Thai language Love Pronunciation of English th R__maji Aramaic of Jesus Ojibwe language

in english where shall we use thanking you or instead of using thank you and what does it mean by cashing shall use that word instead of payiing like ' i can cash u now or i want to cashing you separately' cashing means exchanging a document that isn't cash but that has a specific cash value for cash you cash a check a document that has a cash value but isn't cash cashing the check means that you are giving the check to someone who will be giving you the cash amount written on the check i am cashing my check for at the bank and the cashier will give me for it paying means to give someone either cash or anything else of value to fulfill an obligation or debt or to purchase something james is paying for my old car james is purchasing the car that creates a debt or obligation that james must fulfill by paying the owner of the car when you cash something you get the cash or monetary value of the document when you pay you get nothing back except possibly a receipt showing that you paid because in that case you're fulfilling an obligation or debt thanking you is awkward and i wouldn't use it if all you want to say is thank you if you are speaking directly to someone even if in a letter you say thank you it would be correct to say i am thanking you now if for example someone asked when are you going to thank me the difference is that thanking is used to describe what's happening not to speak directly to someone if you're speaking directly to jane thank you jane if you're describing or explaining what's happening either to jane or someone else i'm thanking you or i'm thanking jane i can pay you now or i want to pay you separately is correct if what you are doing is giving something of value to someone to fulfill an obligation or purchase something if you really must use something different you could say something like i can remit payment to you now or i want to remit payment to you separately as the other answerer said you seem to be pretty confused and i have no idea whether i really understood your question or whether you will understand my answer correctly so seeing a translator would be a good idea  Annuity Microeconomics Bond Contract Money Monetary policy Cheque Debt Wheel of Fortune Inflation Tax Insurance Security (finance) Credit card Poker jargon Deflation (economics) Theory of conduct Hyperinflation The Joker's Wild Euro Automatic teller machine Financial audit Gold standard Bank Babylonian law Biblical inerrancy Life insurance Child support $ale of the Century Surveillance Debugging Mortgage Anarchism and capitalism Stock Economy of Russia FairTax Article One of the United States Constitution Derivative (finance) Corporation U.S. public debt Hiberno-English Corporate governance Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

can you come up with a story using these lines just for the fun of it what shall i do with all of this i never pick the right one love means never having to fairytales can come true should i open it oh no these are all so good i'll have to re read once upon a time pansy peachblossom the forest fairy was strolling through the glade of oaks she liked to lunch in when she came upon a most surprising scene it was a long table covered in a floral tablecloth with a most tempting repast of food there was a mixed green salad potato salad fruit salad two types of chili one with beans one without bbq hot dogs hamburgers and veggie burgers garlic bread and chocolate chip cookies what shall i do with all of this pansy said in awe as she looked at the spread before her despite being hungry for her aforementioned lunch she'd never seen all this human food before so she wasn't sure whether it was edible and even if so whether it would agree with her more on this later grin alas her hunger got the best of her so pansy flitted all along the table sampling a fairy sized portion of some of the dishes no sooner did she finish her chocolate chip cookie crumb than she heard a stir in the trees behind her quickly she flew up into her favorite oak tree just in time to escape being seen by a troop of boy scouts they were enjoying a weekend camp out in these woods and were very hungry after fishing in the creek catching bugs and taking a nature hike as pansy watched the boys at lunch suddenly she became aware of at least one item from lunch that did not in fact agree with her the chili beans unfortunately she began experiencing a lot of flatulence which was surprising and embarrassing all at the same time i never pick the right one pansy cried realizing that she should have eaten the bean less chili although she tried to keep her gas quiet the boys closest to her oak tree perch heard the sound and giggled about it as boys do then they went back to chowing down one boy however was more curious than the others and actually climbed the tree to find the source of the noise his name was spud and he was a cute freckled redhead with kind green eyes slightly crooked teeth and slightly too large ears pansy found herself smitten by his innocent good looks so she didn't fly away as he climbed nearer to her when they finally met high in the leafy limbs of the tree spud was as dazzled by pansy's sky blue eyes flaxen hair and iridescent wings as she was by his appearance within a few minutes to chatting they realized they were both in love and coincidentally they both spouted the same cliche at the same time love means never having to be something you're not despite coming from two separate worlds pansy and spud accepted each others' differences and decided that they would make their relationship work no matter what pansy transformed herself into a butterfly not too difficult since she's a fairy anyway and spud put her carefully into his bug jar hoping that no one would notice his butterfly was actually a fairy in disguise and so he brought her home after the camping trip and she lived in his house without any of the rest of his family knowing about it fairytales can come true it can happen to you if you're young at heart insert music here however that's not the end of our story several months after coming to live with spud and his family pansy got a letter from the fairyland express mail service it was marked priority and from the handwriting it looked like it might have come from her arch rival dahlia pruneblossom anything you could possibly think of that dahlia could be jealous about she found it and pansy was the one whom dahlia went after the most she really seemed to enjoy sabotaging other fairies' happiness dahlia did hence pansy became anxious when she saw the letter should i open it she mused turning it over in her hands suddenly she thought she heard a faint ticking sound coming from inside the envelope this struck her as strange because how could someone fit a bomb inside an envelope then again this was no human sent missive but rather one from the land of fairy where everything is on a much smaller scale so to be on the safe side pansy flung it out spud's conveniently open window as hard as her little arms could fling it was a propitious act because as soon as the envelope hit the ground it exploded and burst into flames to humans it would have sounded like nothing more than a pop but to pansy's ears it was more like a detonation thank goodness she got rid of dahlia's malicious missive before it caused any harm or rather before it caused any harm to spud or pansy because a few inches away from the charred spot of ground where the envelope exploded was a half melted metallic bracelet and on the bracelet were the

could you include these phrases into a story what was i thinking what goes up should come back down right something really stinks so what if turn that frown upside down what goes up should come back down right jonathan mumbled to his puppy that was staring up at him wagging his tail vigorously as jonathan rubbed the back of his own head he was trying to be humorous about having been on the receiving end of a volleyball that seemed to fall out of the sky but he knew better the ball belonged to his neighbors and if jonathan had anything to do with it it had done its last crossing over the fence into his backyard and bonking him on the head while he is sitting in his lawn chair and minding his own business for one moment of guilty pleasure he pictured himself taking the steak knife and cutting right through their volleyball but that would be really immature so what if it is immature he thought to himself getting plunked on the head by a volleyball on almost daily basis now begged leaving the rules of propriety behind jonathan decided to take action so while still rubbing the back of his head with one hand he grabbed the volleyball with the other and sauntered towards the gate that led to his neighbors jonathan noticed the megawatt smiles on the faces of his neighbors paul and tina as he walked into their yard look honey jonathan is bringing our volleyball back would you like to join us for a game jonny tina squealed before jonathan had a chance to answer tina came over grabbed the ball from his hand put her arm through his and announced turn that frown upside down mister i know what will cheer you up come join us for lunch we were about to take a break anyway umm well i don't know about that i'm not that hungry jonathan mumbled tina always hyper with inhuman energy levels chuckled to his undecisive and a bit perplexed expression and retorted oh don't be silly dear i saw what you did to that open buffett on the memorial day party you have a healthy appetite and you should be proud of it besides i bet you haven't had lunch yet how can you not be hungry come come i'll fix you a plate we'll sit by the cabana and enjoy a neighborly lunch on a bright sunny day she was so darn cheerful that jonathan was having a difficult time in finding the words to reprimand her and her volleyball loving hubby who had dashed into the house after waving him hello once jonathan entered their house almost being dragged by tina he was hit by an unidentifiable cloud of stench without even thinking something really stinks he blurted out tina instead of looking offended as jonathan feared she would clapped her hands gleefully and turned to her husband see see jonathan thinks that all those herbs you mix with your food in your desperate hopes to outlive me smell badly too then she turned to jonathan and explained one day i was driving by a health food store and i pulled over to check it out i had read about these herbs that are supposed to give you a longer and healthier life so i bought some she paused to raise her eyes heavenward and exhale gosh what was i thinking they turned out to be smelling so terrible when mixed with any kind of liquid or food that i couldn't touch them again yet my beloved husband here religiously mixes them with his food every single blessed day and i simply have to stay away from him for the next half hour then she winked at jonathan conspiratorially and added but the smell does go away soon and one good thing i can tell you about those herbs is they sure have given him extra power and energy in a lot of physical activites not just volleyball you know finally his energy levels match mine and i sure am not complaining have you even seen me lately without wearing a smile as jonathan shook his head speechless tina chirped in delight oh they have done wonders for his stamina i don't know if he will outlive me or not but i sure am loving the way he is living with me right now tina stopped her babbling when paul called out from the kitchen honey why don't you give poor jonathan's ears a break and get him seated at the cabana and then pour some lemonade in glasses for all of us while i finish fixing lunch tina giggled like a little girl and led a still dazed looking jonathan to their cabana and then rushed inside to pour some icy lemonade for all of them as she was cutting slices of lemons to attach to the rims of the glasses she gaily thought to herself jonathan must be so very happy to have neighbors like us the end  The Amber Spyglass Poker jargon Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Piccolo Junior Saga Humphrey Bogart Happy Tree Friends Milton H.

how did the question mark originate the question mark also known as an interrogation point query or eroteme is a punctuation mark that replaces the full stop at the end of an interrogative sentence it can also be used mid sentence to mark a merely interrogative phrase where it functions similarly to a comma such as in the single sentence where shall we go and what shall we do but this usage is increasingly rare the question mark is not used for indirect questions the question mark character is also often used in place of missing or unknown data history the symbol is generally thought to originate from the latin qu stio meaning question which was abbreviated to qo the uppercase q was written above the lowercase o and this mark was transformed into the modern symbol citation needed another hypothesis about the origin of the question mark proposes that it originated in the th century when it appeared as a point followed by the curved portion written slanted similar to the tilde citation needed lynne truss attributes an early form to alcuin of york truss describes the punctus interrogativus of the late s as a lightning flash striking from right to left the name question mark was coined in the late s the point has always indicated the end of a sentence the curved line represented the intonation pattern of a spoken question citation needed and may be associated with a kind of early musical notation like neumes citation needed an american superstition that movies or television shows with question marks in the title do poorly at the box office has made many studios shy away from the punctuation mark this has caused many works to be retitled when adapted for american cinema such as the book who censored roger rabbit which was retitled who framed roger rabbit without the question mark for the big screen citation needed  Punctuation Quotation mark Apostrophe (mark) Latin alphabet Tilde Diacritic International Phonetic Alphabet English grammar Comma (punctuation) Cyrillic alphabet Full stop Finnish grammar Who Framed Roger Rabbit CPU cache Chinese language Esperanto orthography Binomial nomenclature Arabic alphabet Philosophy of language Dash German grammar Crossword Many-worlds interpretation Singlish Bracket Proto-Indo-European language Exclamation mark Greek language Tone (linguistics) Grammatical mood Tetragrammaton Speech synthesis Biblical canon Abbreviation Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Perl Roman numerals Chinese character Romanian language Braille Kanji New Testament 0 (number) Variable Starfleet ranks and insignia Korean language Capitalization Hyphen Documentary hypothesis Klingon language Slash (punctuation) Relative clause Hiberno-English Glossary of partner dance terms Infinity Spanish language English verbs Gender-neutral language Vowel Fair use XML ISO/IEC 8859 Acronym and initialism Egyptian language Trigonometric function Australian English HTML element Names of numbers in English Z Second language acquisition Bible Japanese language Question Care Bears Varieties of Arabic Scientific method New Zealand English Taiwanese (linguistics) Tamil language Lisp programming language Hiragana Pinyin Literature The Prisoner Ligature (typography) Hangul Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation)

conversation with miss kitty right now decided the marshal as he strapped on his peacemaker and headed over to the long branch festus jumped up excitedly from the corner of the desk where he had lighted after his imaginary cat fight matt motioned emphatically for him to stay put as he glided determinedly forward on his mission matt quickly reached the saloon home of miss kitty and entered without hesitation to find miss kitty languorously swaying on a staircase railing post slur werbling some unintelligible tune interspersed with little grunts and an occasional boisterous ha matt s instant impression was that miss kitty was as schnackered as a cowhand on his first day in town after a couple four months on the range and a pocketful of wages while he remained focused on miss kitty he registered in the corner of his eye an empty wiskey bottle lying prone on the bar but nothing else that invited possible trouble wuh welllll uh huh heh helllloooo buh buh bubba ha bubba thash a goo good wah un helloooo bubba schnack ha ha hello b big booooy miss kitty was finally able to vamp in her most sultry voice and attitude given her condition hello kitty replied the marshal coolly been having a rather long visit with mr beam i see awww nuh now donchew be b bad mou mouthin mah f frens moaned miss kitty indignantly as she gracelessly traipsed her way from the staircase towards matt ah ruh rather lack muh misterrrrrrrrrrr beam he cares bout me a huh hello lot mo mo more than yew now kitty you know i still care about you remonstrated miss kitty s real friend yew dew gushed kitty hopefully as she had involuntarily retreated to the staircase post and now had swung herself back in the direction of her renewed romantic interest yuh yew know whut i eye want whut i want i want tew st stut steal yuh oooor tenshun steal yer uh tehshun like a b baaaaaaad owlaw so me ah an thhhhhhe g guh girls here can wr ruh rangle yer hart thash wut desperately explained mish kuh kitty as she unabashedly fondled her lacey bodice for the girls and attempted to lasso her man with a rope that wasn t there um baaaaad mar marshal yew shhhhhud lock me up lock me up with yew an nan throoooow way that key offered miss kitty as she locked the cell door on her heart and threwwwwww the key cheerily realizing that being locked up in the jail with matt would keep her really close to her man well i think we could arrange that for you replied the marshal stoically intending a lone prisoner in his cell that would allow any planned ka booming to be forgotten in the pangs of what was sure to he a banging hangover yew mean that gasped a clueless miss kitty missing matt s intent and thinking there would be two inmates involved in her lock up hee haw i loooooove yew buh buh karoooooooo with a victorious yelp miss kitty rose with only a slight tipsy from the staircase and bolted headlong about one foot to the right of where matt was actually standing just as she reached her buckaroo she leapt her legs now parallel to the floor and spread wide to wrap around her matt s hulking torso her arm s reaching for his neck however in her jim beamish torpor she had attempted to make a piggyfront landing around mmm mmm mmm matt but had aimed her intentions at the figment of her inebriated eyesight she landed completely unmolested unfortunately and without the least degree of daintiness on her delicious petticoated derriere and promptly found the floor with the back of her head ka thunk no more ka boom when kitty had started her off target charge matt knew precisely what was happening and what was about to happen he decided in her loose state miss kitty stood little chance of actually hurting herself so he let the charging intoxicant follow her own course and mischievously anticipated the landing scene chuckling quietly to himself and figuring the impending shock might bring some sense back to her matt observed the floored form of his friend for a moment and then kindly stepped beside her as he leaned over to help the roused but no longer aroused miss kitty matt had underestimated the load of a limp lush lady he slightly tipped his balance over kitty for the briefest moment but at the same instant she roguishly reached her arms around his neck and matt fell haplessly in a full bodied pancake directly on top of his fortunate and definitely pleased newly found floormate matt wailed sunshine who had just walked over to the long branch with festus he had goaded her into a visit when she had gone to the jail to talk with matt about their plans for a quiet weekend together and she along with the scalawag were now peering over the saloon doors sunshine fixed in horror festus gleefully soaking in every possible source of his amusement from matt kitty sunshine kitty matt kitty sunshine matt the compromised marshal strained his neck in the direction of sunshine as miss kitty slipped into pretended unconsciousness and tightened her hold around matt s sturdy neck sunshine it s alright soothed matt if you have to just take a pill and put a little faith in me at the mention of sunshine kitty tightened her grip even more which matt began to delicately undue to which kitty tightened yet more firmly sunshine paused only for a moment she knew that tone matt was about his business not miss kitty s she realized festus culpability in the circumstance and took his hat off glared him in the eyes and whacked him on the head with his own hat she then strode on undisturbedly with her business calling back to matt see you at supper sugar as she dangled festus hat teasingly in her stride just out of the rascal s reach to lead him on a little chase for her merry repayment  USS Tunny (SS-282) The Jim Rome Show Friends Syphon Filter Diving

why do we still use lb to abbreviate pound lb is the abbreviation for libras remember the scales in the zodiac we can't use pd that is used to abbreviate paid by some and what about the sign how did that become the pound sign lb of course stands for libras representing scales or measurement of weight so it's only natural that the abbreviation lb is still associated with the measurement regarding the ' ' sign used to abbreviate it in some regions of the united states and canada the symbol is traditionally called the pound sign but in others the number sign this derives from a series of abbreviations for pound which is a unit of mass or weight at first lb was used later printers got a special font made up of an lb with a line through the ascenders so that the lowercase letter l would not be mistaken for the number unicode character u is called the lb bar symbol and it is a cursive development of this symbol finally came the reduction to a combination of two horizontal cf skewed and two forward slash like cf strokes in this respect names like fence or square as well as the representation of the sign containing two exactly vertical instead of slanted strokes as in many keyboards including cell phones' are misleading its traditional commercial use in the u s was such that when it followed a number it was to be read as pounds as in of sugar and when it preceded a number it was to be read 'number' as in pencil thus the same character in a printer's type case had two uses  Cyrillic alphabet Diacritic Chinese character Hangul Latin alphabet Ligature (typography) C Apostrophe (mark) Half r Punctuation Typeface Unicode Apple typography Arabic alphabet 0 (number) Shogi Braille Chinese numerals Devan__gar__ Esperanto orthography Writing system United States dollar Collation L PostScript Control character Decibel Wallpaper group X Zodiac Dash Pinyin Force D Ton Blackletter Judkins shogi Cangjie method 4 (number) 1 (number) Paper size M Traffic sign Keyboard layout Euro United States Postal Service APL programming language Cannon shogi British coinage Zhuyin ALGOL 68 A R Killian documents Kanji F Shorthand Carolingian minuscule Cursive 7 (number) Tablature Mass Drawing XML T Slashed zero Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics Fairy chess piece Vehicle registration plate Weight Medical prescription Greek alphabet Glossary of graph theory Radical (Chinese character) H 2 (number) Quotation mark Dot matrix printer 6 (number) Diaeresis Hyphen Khmer script Z Runic alphabet Weighing scale Lead

what happened to spelling and grammar no one can spell or create a cognitive sentence these days what's with the bad spelling these days and the grammar is just bad some questions here i can't even understand because of it any ideas i'm not sure it has changed that much to be honest i think there have always been people who couldn't put a good sentence together to save their life the difference now is that the internet allows people who can't write to put their words into the public conciousness in the old days only people who could write well would ever be read because you had to be published for numerous people to read your work i've had the opportunity to read many personal letters written between common uneducated people from one hundred to three hundred years ago and let me tell you the average grammar in those letters isn't much better than what you find on the internet we think people one hundred years ago wrote better because we only ever read the best writings of the time but there were some real abominations then as well as long as there has been grammar it has been used poorly  Spanish language Finnish language Theory of conduct English grammar Singlish American and British English differences German language Dutch language Indian English Scientology beliefs and practices Tetragrammaton Danish language Esperanto grammar Esperanto as an international language Hebrew language Literacy Leet Spanish verbs Arabic grammar Arabic alphabet Non-native pronunciations of English Slovak language Vietnamese language Linguistics Dyslexia Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Hiberno-English Arabic language Education Classical Chinese Amiga Power Finnish grammar Korean language Ethics Noah Webster Hangul Philosophy of language Philosophical Investigations Spelling reform Persian language Spoken Finnish Translation Hong Kong English Tamil language Transformational grammar Marshall McLuhan Second language acquisition Chinese language Afrikaans Chinese grammar Lojban Grammatical aspect Socrates New Zealand English House of Leaves English verbs Natural semantic metalanguage Wolof language Indonesian language Chinese character Hindi Hungarian language English spelling Names of numbers in English R__maji Whose Line Is It Anyway?

is the word butt considered sexual harrasement ok i was talking to some one with my back turned and a friend coworker who is a man threw a pin at me he was turned backward as well and it hit my butt he didnt intentionally hit my butt and he always throws pins as a joke but because i said butt can another coworker someone who has nothing to do with it say that is sexuall harrasement the basic and very very limited definition of sexual harassment is a situation gesture word or action which causes another usually in the workplace to feel threatened by its use so for the person who mentioned that the word offends her him they have just laid the groundwork for a future sexual harassment issue with you and all other co workers who use that and similar words so in your situation yes it can be considered harassment if you continue one incident does not usually deem it to be harassment do not use the word again and if you find yourself using it apologize and do so sincerely do not make that person feel sorry for mentioning the fact to you or you could find yourself at the wrong end of a costly court case if no one in the workplace is offended by the word or brings it to the attention of others then and again in the simpliest of terms it is not considered sexual harassment here's where that gets tricky though if an employer insists that you have sex with him her in order to keep your job then that is sexual harrassment regardless of whether or not you tell anyone else about it the theory and it's a good one is that most people would be too embarrassed to speak up and tell anyone what is going on that doesn't make it acceptable also things to not have to be sexual harassment to be harassment and therefore illegal take the pin throwing incident that you seem to be tolerating this can be considered harassment and probably qualify as sexual harassment so why is the co worker throwing pins around and why do you find this to be acceptable behavior this falls into the same realm of tolerated behavior as butt pinching umm no because in my book this is dangerously close to sexual harassment especially if that person has any authority over you besides it's not safe grown up or professional environment for co workers to be in put an end to the pin throwing behavior now before that causes a serious problem  Sexual harassment Domestic violence Sexual orientation Pedophilia Rape Transsexuality Human sexual behavior Infantilism Homophobia Child sexual abuse Harassment Gay rights Social rule Gender role Workplace democracy Theory of conduct Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Political correctness Sexual assault in the U.S. military Abortion debate Childlove movement Asperger syndrome Ethics Professional wrestling holds Internet troll Theodicy Contract Narcissism Professional wrestling throws Fair Game (Scientology) Sexual revolution Transgender Stuttering George Costanza Buttocks Pornography Nicomachean Ethics Homosexuality and transgender Autism Goodness and value theory Spanking Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Hate speech Socrates Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Racism Zoophilia Interpersonal relationship Bernard Williams Toilet humour Children of God Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Brave New World Reparative therapy Traumatic incident reduction Mediation Plame affair Gender-neutral language Homosexuality and Christianity Gay Dilbert 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Trade union Tag A Course In Miracles Affirmative action Child pornography Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Bisexuality Cult Civil rights Homosexuality in China Science Strap-on dildo Avenue Q Oral sex Coming of Age (TNG episode) Bondage (BDSM) John Howard Yoder Autism rights movement Sin City Baseball Customs and etiquette of Japan Mixed martial arts Coercion Lawrence v.

can u give me correct definition of love love was found times in verses on the bible here is some romans love worketh no ill to his neighbour therefore love is the fulfilling of the law john beloved let us love one another for love is of god and every one that loveth is born of god and knoweth god john no man hath seen god at any time if we love one another god dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us proverbs better is a dinner of herbs where love is than a stalled ox and hatred therewith song of solomon let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth for thy love is better than wine song of solomon set me as a seal upon thine heart as a seal upon thine arm for love is strong as death jealousy is cruel as the grave the coals thereof are coals of fire which hath a most vehement flame romans for this thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness thou shalt not covet and if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself romans love worketh no ill to his neighbour therefore love is the fulfilling of the law john for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life corinthians if i speak in the tongues of men and of angels but have not love i am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal and if i have prophetic powers and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and if i have all faith so as to remove mountains but have not love i am nothing if i give away all i have and if i deliver my body to be burned but have not love i gain nothing love is patient and kind love is not jealous or boastful it is not arrogant or rude love does not insist on its own way it is not irritable or resentful it does not rejoice at wrong but rejoices in the right love bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things love never ends as for prophecies they will pass away as for tongues they will cease as for knowledge it will pass away for our knowledge is imperfect and our prophecy is imperfect but when the perfect comes the imperfect will pass away when i was a child i spoke like a child i thought like a child i reasoned like a child when i became a man i gave up childish ways for now we see in a mirror dimly but then face to face now i know in part then i shall understand fully even as i have been fully understood so faith hope love abide these three but the greatest of these is love there is diffrent kinds of love like we learned in social ethics the maternal parternal agape to name a few but it never gave me a better view and understanding as the chapters above also see pilosophy of love the philosophical treatment of love transcends a variety of sub disciplines including epistemology metaphysics religion human nature politics and ethics often statements or arguments concerning love its nature and role in human life for example connect to one or all the central theories of philosophy and is often compared with or examined in the context of the philosophies of sex and gender the task of a philosophy of love is to present the appropriate issues in a cogent manner drawing on relevant theories of human nature desire ethics and so on this brief introduction examines the nature of love and some of the ethical and political ramifications thanks for asking this be blessed  Original sin Agap__ Dispensationalism Philosophy Summa Theologiae Philipp Melanchthon Book of Isaiah Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Immanuel Kant Holy Spirit Reincarnation Ethics Love Merit Meaning of life Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Atheism Epistemology Sabbath Psychopannychism Maimonides Resurrection of Jesus Rastafari movement Existence of God Idolatry Jewish views of religious pluralism Book of Mormon New Testament Hell Amidah Hidden Words Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Philosophy of language Eastern Orthodox Church Homosexuality and Christianity Apocrypha Leviathan (book) Jewish ethics Angel God and gender Eucharist Virgin Mary in Islam Articles of Religion (Methodist) Apostasy Simone Weil Heaven Sin Predestination John Howard Yoder Christianity Metaphysics King James Version of the Bible Jewish principles of faith Phaedo Abraham Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Bertrand Russell David Hume Justification (theology) Creationism Mary, the mother of Jesus Jehovah's Witnesses Church of Christ, Scientist Joseph of Arimathea Judaism Religion and sexuality Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Christian-Jewish reconciliation Macbeth Friedrich Nietzsche Christian apologetics John Wycliffe Confucianism Priesthood (Mormonism) Nontrinitarianism Christianity and anti-Semitism Causality Altruism Origen Theology

does this sentence make since i feel like most of my friends are becoming so distant from me i feel like is not wrong as stated previously in colloquial speech i've heard this many times by native speakers such as myself in casual conversation and there's never been a question of its meaning i feel as if is a synonym for one of its meanings the one used in the question though so may be used this way in casual speech very does seem better unless the speaker is placing emphasis on how distant the friends have become instead of the fact that they are becoming distant at all the wording is a bit awkward towards the end of the sentence and i would tend to agree that becoming so distant from me would sound better as distancing themselves from me however distancing themselves from me implies that the speaker's friends are consciously making the decision to stay away physically and or emotionally whereas becoming so distant from me can mean the speaker does not know whether the friends are doing this intentionally or not perhaps it is circumstances beyond anyone's control such as busy schedules  Contemporary culture of South Korea Hiberno-English The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy My Sassy Girl MSN Messenger Profanity Spanish dialects and varieties Macbeth Iki (aesthetic ideal) Cyndi Lauper W.I.T.C.H.

how come sometimes it's not necessary to add s after some of the words for example sotimes i would buy some fiction to read question how come s is not added after fiction for some reason i was late for the train question home come s is not added after reason well in the second example you do add the s if there is more than one reason the sentence for some reason i couldn't remember his name still suggests a single reason even if you haven't figured out what it is yet so the singular form is used on the other hand they lost the championship for several reasons indicates multiple reason s hence the plural in the case of fiction look at how the noun is used the plural form is in fact used the latest harry potter book is a work of fiction but if you're discussing the entire series they would be called works of fiction the s goes after the first noun work the same would apply to books of poetry works of art or examples of darwinism  Oxford English Dictionary Jon Secada Dutch language Webster's Dictionary BBC Radio 4 Past teachings of Prem Rawat Dictionary Noah Webster Arab Vowel Sacred Harp History of the English Bible WNNX (FM) Diving regulator Charles Goodyear Shaggy dog story A Course In Miracles Kitchen Haven (TNG episode) Spanish language German spelling reform of 1996 Objectivist philosophy Tok Pisin Herpes simplex virus Chinese character Sant Mat Italian language Xiangqi Sabbath Indonesian language Korean language Wiki KUKL Slovenian language Latin Chronic fatigue syndrome Folic acid English grammar Wallflower (comics) German language Steely Dan Anorexia nervosa The Dalek Invasion of Earth Revised (Magic: The Gathering) Adi Da Inflection A Tonic For The Troops Current teachings of Prem Rawat GNU Free Documentation License Blankets (graphic novel) The Joshua Tree Shit Hangul Dream Breastfeeding New Haven, Connecticut Germaine Greer Paracetamol Carl Jung Immanuel Kant Podcasting Colony in Space Dictionary of National Biography Meal Singlish Pizza Revised Romanization of Korean Pow-wow Kender Jargon File Social rule Gry Dinner I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Don Knotts Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?

english grammar what is wrong with this sentence why nothing is also an answer i gave her a name which was betty the correction is i called her betty what is the inverted comas for they are not inverted commas they are quotations marks they indicate that they are someone's direct words if they are doubles and that they are a paraphrase the meaning but not the exact words if they are in the sigle ' also if i write my exact words and they are telling exactly what you said you use both as in the man quoted his brother as saying 'man my father's son is ugly' it can also be used when the word or words are made up such as calling her betty if you called her betty then that is probably not her name or you would have said her name was betty and not used any quote marks  Vacuum Cyrillic alphabet Latin alphabet Vulgar Latin Latin spelling and pronunciation Phoneme B3ta Gascony Writing French language LOL (Internet slang) International Phonetic Alphabet Old English language Greek language Shibboleth English language Negima English spelling Alphabet Italian language Ornament (music) R__maji Hanja H Pure Pwnage Tetragrammaton Vietnamese language Caron Acute accent Vacuum tube Vacuum cleaner Polish language Wolof language Manner of articulation Tatar alphabet Spelling reform French Renaissance literature Jehovah Dictionary Persian language Spelling pronunciation Dutch language Romanization Serbo-Croatian language History of the Arabic alphabet Writing system of Spanish Oops!...

can you write a good story using these phrases just for fun not h w suddenly the lights went out don't tempt me twice if that's the truth what exactly happened here next time if there is a next time i'll i hope that's not what i think it is one day in new york if that's the truth then we're going to have no choice but to sell our shares timmy i muttered into the cell phone normally i'd never bring my phone out in the subway car but my day was going to hell in a handbasket so i was beyond caring what the other commuters thought of my breach of etiquette the snob in front of me had already made deep huffing noises twice and the hobo behind me was eyeing the phone like a future investment well i don't care timmy call our broker get it taken care of i hung up and glared at the snob as if i could force all the wretchedness i felt on her i could almost envision her drab blouse catching fire and suddenly the lights went out as i was positive my day could not get worse that's exactly what it did one minute i'm casting smouldering glances at this witch in front of me and the next i'm blind in the dark a collective groan rose from the subway car i dropped the cell phone back in my pocket and hoisted my umbrella defensively i hope that's not what i think it is a haughty female voice said from in front of me oh dream on i hissed as i shifted the umbrella again to keep from poking her to truly top matters i noticed that the subway car had come to a complete stop as power apparently had shorted in the rails as well great now i would be late for work on top of everything else hey buddy a gravelly voice whispered behind me that wassa nice phone you had there fella like you prolly has some spare change too give it a rest huh corky i said i mean these people would panhandle in the middle of nuclear fallout i felt the hobo's hand paw at the back of my shirt andi half turned poking the snob with my umbrella again by accident watch it jerk she growled you're gonna run that thing through my skull if you keep it up don't tempt me twice lousy witch why don't you move forward in the car a ways and give me some breathing room eh i was starting to shake as agitation surrounded me on all sides well next time if there is a next time i'm gonna stick your umbrella and your cell phone in your poop chute smoke on that you smarta c'mon pal just a buck or two ya gotta have at least that both of you stifle it i screamed why the hell did i ever pick this city you bunch of morons could drive the pope crazy a chorus of commentary reached me from all over the subway car shaddap close it then move away jerkoff yadda yadda yadda the hobo's hand closed over my wrist this time and i snapped the true new yorker in me came to the fore and i started swing my umbrella and yelling at the top of my lungs in the dark i have no idea who i hit or even the things i said i just kept screaming and swinging swinging and screaming more hands grabbed me and i grew all the more frenzied and that's all i remember two hours later the power came back on the subway car started moving and the lights popped back on inside at the fifth street station the doors opened and a police officer came in to check on the wellbeing of the formerly trapped passengers officer gentry who retired one week later will never forget what he discovered inside of car number on that day the visions will haunt him for what remains of his life and the media can only speculate as to what vision greeted him he will not talk about it so don't ask him and me what exactly happened here they all asked me what went on in there for two hours but i'm not talking haven't said a word since that day in fact it's been four years of silence and i don't think i'd have it any other way i have diarrhea of the story sorry for the length lol have a good day  Bread Cuisine of Denmark Jewish cuisine Spidey Super Stories Chile pepper Cuisine of the Southern United States Roman eating and drinking Hamburger Paul Is Dead

where did the word ok come from what was the story behind it thank you this is one theory word history ok is a quintessentially american term that has spread from english to many other languages its origin was the subject of scholarly debate for many years until allen walker read showed that ok is based on a joke of sorts ok is first recorded in but was probably in circulation before that date during the s there was a humoristic fashion in boston newspapers to reduce a phrase to initials and supply an explanation in parentheses sometimes the abbreviations were misspelled to add to the humor ok was used in march as an abbreviation for all correct the joke being that neither the o nor the k was correct originally spelled with periods this term outlived most similar abbreviations owing to its use in president martin van buren's campaign for reelection because he was born in kinderhook new york van buren was nicknamed old kinderhook and the abbreviation proved eminently suitable for political slogans that same year an editorial referring to the receipt of a pin with the slogan o k had this comment frightful letters significant of the birth place of martin van buren old kinderhook as also the rallying word of the democracy of the late election 'all correct' those who wear them should bear in mind that it will require their most strenuous exertions to make all things o k  Brahman Czech language Vulgar Latin H Gender-neutral language Polish language Esperanto vocabulary Greek language Gender Bulgarian language Arabic grammar Acute accent Masculinity Hindi Unisex name Hebrew language Spanish nouns Albanian language Philo Quebec French Man Old French Grammatical number Spanish pronouns Sudetes Dutch language Tamil language Italian language Torres Strait Islanders Effeminacy -onym Syriac language Princess French grammar Gothic language Article (grammar) Varieties of Arabic Ancient Greek Western Armenian language Slovak language Cool (African philosophy) Haruka Tenoh Serbo-Croatian language English grammar Masculism Laurens van der Post R2-D2 Welsh language Gender-neutral pronoun German language Differences in official languages in Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia Dutch grammar God and gender Aramaic language Scottish Gaelic language Saint Peter Sandawe language At sign Elision Agreement (linguistics) Tallit Elohim Allah Devi Mahatmyam Old English language Walloon language Liaison Sercquiais Oz (TV series) Semitic languages Grammatical gender Virtue Yin and yang Chicago Hope Given name Ralph Lauren Xhosa language Latin spelling and pronunciation Maya mythology Robert L.

where did the word ok come from what was the story behind it thank you well there are a lot of thereoys the choctaw theory in the american choctaw indian language there is a word okeh which means it is so it is likely although i can find no hard evidence that this word was used in some american communities in the early th century there is a report that andrew jackson during the battle of new orleans in learned of this choctaw word liked it and used it woodrow wilson also preferred this etymology and used okeh when he approved official papers his use led to this particular form being picked up by okeh records the name of a series of popular phonograph records mencken as well as hot dog stands shoe shining parlours and more the andrew jackson libel theory some time around seba smith was accused of libel in claiming that andrew jackson endorsed a pronouncement written by his literary secretary amos kendell with ok amos the details are not very clear but it is possible that what was really written was or meaning order recorded however one newspaper reporting on the matter presumably some years later said that the letters ok had been adopted as a sort of democratic part cry and were fastened upon their banners this does give at least some credence to the idea that ok was at least in familiar use prior to the wolof theory like choctaw indian the wolof language spoken in senegal and the gambia formerly the gold coast has something like okeh to mean an emphatic yes it's more like waa key in reality wolof has given american english a number of words perhaps through the african slave trade such as juke honky to mean a white man hipcat or hepcat meaning a jazz enthusiast jive and even dig as in to understand although it should be noted that there is nowhere near universal agreement on these it is likely that okeh appeared in early black american spoken slang the other languages theories yet more languages have similar sounding words for yes or it is so liberian has oke and burmese has hoakeh for instance yet again it is possible that these examples crept into american use in small isolated areas at some time prior to the indian chief theory keokuk was an indian chief after whom keokuk in iowa is named his admirers sometimes referred to him as old keokuk he's all right and the initials ok came to mean the same thing the orl korrect theory the internet fashion for condensing phrases into abbreviation certainly not new the s saw a rise of quirky abbreviations for common phrases which for some reason seems to have been particularly popular in boston isbd was used to mean it shall be done rtbs for it remains to be seen and sp for small potatoes it went further with ky used to mean no use know yuse and an article in the march rd edition of the boston morning post saw this produce ok short for all correct orl korrect this is the earliest published appearance of ok that has so far been found the richardson theory william richardson recorded his journey from boston to new orleans in his diary transcriptions of the diary show arrived at princeton a handsome little village o k and at trenton where we dined at p m although in some have proposed that this showed the use of the expression in the original manuscript shows that this was actually part of some alterations that may have been added by richardson or someone else possibly even after when the term had come into common use another possibility is that the writing is of a h referring to a handsome but there are many objections to this theory the th century theories several claims have been made to have found appearances of ok have in th century manuscripts in one instance notes queries points out that the will of thomas cumberland in is shown to use ok but more careful scrutiny shows that this is more likely to have been the initials of the scrivener books published in and also have ok included but apparently as nouns the text of one have with you to saffron walden by thomas nashe the british author goes martin is guerra brown a brone bill barrow a wheelbarrow ket a knight h n referring to henry nichols an o k as mencken states in his supplement to the american language the meaning here is unfathomable the old kinderhook theory martin van buren was standing as the democratic presidential candidate in he had acquired the nickname of old kinderhook he was born in kinderhook new york on march the democrats opened the ok club in grand street new york city based on the initials of van buren's nickname the expression ok soon became the watchword of this club and in that same year a democratic newspaper equated the initials with the strivings of the party to make all things ok the cockney orl korrec theory the times in had an article reporting that it was of cockney origin the author remembered its use as an abbreviation for orl korrec when he was a boy in the late th century however this post dates its first appearance by many years the french theory during the american war of independence french sailors made appointments with american girls aux quais meaning when they were berthed at the quayside this theory was put forward by britain's daily express newspaper in the finish theory the fins have a word for correct and it is oikea in a article someone at the cleveland public library suggested that this may be the origin the british parliament theory the same source as the cockney theory the times in pointed out that some bills going through the house of lords had to be read and approved by lords onslow and kilbracken and they each initialed them producing the combined initials ok the anglo saxon theory several centuries before its first appearance norwegian and danish sailors used an anglo saxon word hogfor which meant ready for sea this was frequently shortened to hg which in turn would have been pronounced hag gay the literary theory laurence sterne was a british author of the th century and in his book a sentimental journey published in he uses the emphatic french form of yes o qu oui in an anglicised pronunciation oh key the phrase was used by some to express affirmation the schoolmaster theory in a letter in the vancouver sun in it was pointed out that early schoolmasters would mark examination papers by adding the latin omnis korrecta which was sometimes abbreviated to ok the ship builder theory early ship builders would mark the timber they prepared and the first to be laid was marked ok number meaning outer keel no the telegraph theory early telegraph operators abbreviated everything to reduce the amount of work needed they would use gm for good morning ga for go ahead and so on in tatler in the observer suggests that they also used ok this doesn't stand up at all as the telegraph post dated the first written occurrence and it is almost certain in my view that they adopted ok rather than inventing it the scottish theory we've all heard the scottish expression och aye an author in the nottingham journal in suggests that ok is simply an adaptation of this expression the scottish expression derives from och meaning an exclamation of surprise and aye meaning yes and has been in existence since perhaps the th century the old english theory in early england the last harvest loads brought in from the fields were known as hoacky or horkey it was also the name given to harvest home which was the feast which followed the last loads brought in the satisfactory completion of harvest was therefore known as hoacky which was soon at least according to an article in the daily telegraph in shortened to ok the prussian theory the times printed a suggestion that the prussian general schliessen fighting for the american colonies during the war of independence was

how various pronunciations of pretty before an adjective indicates differnt meanings i read this in a book for instance i'm pretty hungry could be pronounce in two ways hence two different meanings of 'pretty' it was written in american headway a book used in language institutes i think there is some confusion about your question people think you are asking about below i assume you mean the confusion may be because you speak about different pronunciation to most people that means that you use different sounds or accent different syllables but these things do not change no matter how you are using the word what does change is how much you emphasize the word in a sentence pretty can be used as an adjective meaning attractive beautiful as when someone says she's a pretty girl it can also be used as an adverb in combination with an adjective in this case it means fairly moderately to a reasonable degree it does not mean the same thing as very and example would be i'm pretty hungry meaning i am fairly hungry this is not the same as saying i am pretty and hungry in this sentence pretty and hungry would both be adjectives but the example you give is of the adverb not the adjective use and the adverb and adjective are pronounced exactly the same way so perhaps the book is referring to how putting a special emphasis on the adverb when you speak can change the meaning of the sentence slightly normally when you use pretty as an adverb the main emphasis is on the adjective that follows so ifsomeone says it was a pretty good day they are being positive the idea is that they are satisfied with how good it was perhaps even surprised at how it was better than they expected but sometimes a person will strongly emphasize the word pretty saying well it was pretty good day in that case the person is emphasizing that it was only fairly good instead of very good they are suggesting that the day could have been better and maybe they are complaining suggesting that they think it should have been better so this emphasized use of pretty makes what you are saying with the adjective weaker not stronger  Lynbrook High School Exercise Ra (board game) Football Leisure Conker Go (board game) Scottish highland dance First-class cricket Football (soccer) Aerobic exercise IBM PC compatible Computer and video game genres Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Surreal number Beatmania IIDX GED Ceroc Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Physical education International Olympic Committee Education in Germany Game Polymorphism (computer science) Game design Backgammon Conway's Game of Life Happy Tree Friends Dominoes Mahjong Marching band ELO rating system Final Fantasy magic $ale of the Century President (game) Closure (computer science) Contract bridge Social rule Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition Phantasy Star Online Puyo Pop Fever W.

why are there interstate highways in hawaii ask the rambler interstates in hawaii are we crazy the rambler is often asked how hawaii can have interstate highways when the roads clearly don't connect two states the question is often followed by the observation that just in case the rambler hadn't noticed hawaii doesn't share a border with any other state and is in fact miles away the blank indicates that people asking the question don't know how many miles away but they're pretty sure it's a far piece actually hawaii is miles from san francisco so it would take a structure the length of i to bridge the gap by road let's face it interstate means existing between or including different states so interstates in hawaii must be if nothing else a linguistic inconsistency why is it that people suddenly become linguists when it comes to interstates in hawaii okay okay here's the scoop for the most part the interstate system is a connected network of highways bound by the canadian and mexican borders the gulf of mexico and the atlantic and pacific oceans however hawaii has several interstate routes that are not connected to the rest of the system but are nevertheless part of it hawaii's interstate routes were an outgrowth of the statehood movement that culminated on march when president dwight d eisenhower signed legislation making hawaii a state that same year section of the federal aid highway act of directed the secretary of commerce where the u s bureau of public roads bpr was located at the time to study the need for interstate routes in alaska and hawaii after identifying possible routes the bpr evaluated them according to the same criteria applied during a expansion of the interstate system national defense system integration the value of the route as a connector between centers of population and industry service to industry fishing agriculture mining and forestry as measured by the value of products or by traffic data and population on that basis the bpr's january report to congress recommended a mile interstate network in hawaii the report recommended against designating interstate mileage in alaska the hawaii omnibus act which president eisenhower signed on july removed the limitation in federal aid highway law that the interstate system be designated only within the continental united states and provided for the regular apportionment of interstate construction ic funds to the state on august the bpr designated three routes identified as h h and h photo of hawaii's designated three routes identified as h h and h on november the federal highway administration approved the state's request for a fourth route a mile section of moanalua freeway state route that had been upgraded to interstate standards without interstate construction funds it was assigned the temporary number h a but was numbered h on december the hawaii department of transportation has chosen not to display the number on the route the rambler thinks the decision to designate interstate routes in hawaii may become clearer by adding that the interstate system is more than just a series of connected highways it is also a design concept with highways designed to handle high volumes of traffic safely and efficiently at freeway speeds moreover the interstate system is not limited to routes passing through two or more states many interstates such as circumferentials beltways and spurs are confined to one state although hawaii's interstate highways are not connected to those in the continental united states they are built to interstate standards the fact that they carry an h number rather than an i number differentiates them from the connected system of interstate routes on the continental united states update the hawaii department of transportation completed h in with the dedication ceremony held on december controversy followed the highway from start to finish but h emerged as one the most beautiful segments of the interstate system the completion of h in h has emerged as one of the most beautiful segments of the interstate system the rambler didn't want to mention it but alaska and puerto rico also have interstate highways under title united states code section the bpr fhwa designated four routes totaling miles of interstate highways in alaska puerto rico's three interstate highways total miles unlike the mileage in hawaii the mileage in alaska and puerto rico is exempt from meeting interstate design standards section c b ii states that these routes shall be designed in accordance with such geometric and construction standards as are adequate for current and probable future traffic demands and the needs of the locality of the highway alaska's interstate highways are designated a a a and a while puerto rico's routes are designated pri pri and pri  13 (number) Chinese astrology Solitaire Card game ZGMF-X12 Gundam Astray Out Frame 12 (number) Flag of the United States 4 (number) Psalms

what does 'how do you do' mean what exactly does 'how do you do' mean i know it sounds dumb but i'm so very tired and i can't remember unfortunately all but one of the answers so far are seriously mistaken it is likely that when first used this expression was a literal inquiry about how well someone was doing in that case you could give a full answer or simply respond politely with something like very well thank you for asking but that is not what the expression now means nor has it been for quite a long time now it is simply a polite greeting no longer a question and so you would not likely answer very well or the like the proper response is usually to saw exactly the same thing back that is if someone says how do you do the answer is how do you do also this form is now generally used only as a response to meeting someone for the first time you would not use it when you are greeting a friend of acquaintance it usually works something like this another person is introduced to you by name it may involve a third party introducing the two of you telling each the other's name etc following this each of you in turn says how do you do in other words it is not a question any longer but a polite acknowledgment essentially the equivalent of it's nice an honor etc to meet you what's interesting is that this change from a genuine question to a polite greeting has happened more than once though in all the following examples they can be used anytime you see someone not just when you first meet them consider the greeting howdy or howdy do these are simply simplifications the second more obviously of how do you do and you would never respond to howdy with an explanation of how things are going for you in the northeast nowadays the greeting is how ya doin this too is a greeting not a question to answer the appropriate respond again is to say the same in return how ya doin' there's a hilarious beer commercial involving a texan who comes into a bar and responds to this greeting with a long winded detailing of his travels having no clue what is meant by the expression one problematic example how are you and how are you doing are often used in the way just described but they also are used as literal questions expecting an answer it may at times be difficult to tell which of these someone has in mind which may produce an awkward response it is best if you do intend to question to modify or add to the question in someone to make that clear e g how's your day week going so john how are you doing today  Alphabet Indulgence English spelling Abbreviation Latin alphabet Greek language Cedilla Phoneme __ H Diacritic Pinyin Silent letter Hangul Old English language Cyrillic alphabet Tetragrammaton Thorn (letter) W Spelling reform Minuscule Spelling bee Capitalization Writing system of Spanish Circumflex Acute accent Acrostic Persian language Letter case Y German language NATO phonetic alphabet Scrabble (game show) Shavian alphabet Danish language Writing system Thai alphabet French language Tsar Reforms of Russian orthography Cursive Italian language X Umlaut G Russian language International Phonetic Alphabet Caron Alternative political spellings Grave accent Apostrophe (mark) Wylie transliteration R__maji Revised Romanization of Korean Crossword History of the Arabic alphabet Dutch language Slovak language Wolof language Jehovah Afrikaans Finnish language Phonics Leet Latin spelling and pronunciation Indonesian language Swedish language German alphabet English words with uncommon properties Spelling pronunciation Lingo (game show) Fuck Bible code Masoretic Text German spelling reform of 1996 Phonology Voiceless velar plosive Voiced bilabial plosive Dictionary Zapatista Army of National Liberation Oxford English Dictionary Voiced alveolar plosive Jubilee (Christian) Welsh language Heavy metal umlaut Portuguese alphabet Latvian language Scottish Gaelic language Spanish language Lojban Brussels Tibetan script Old Irish language New Zealand English Writing Magick Tetum language Plenary Councils of Baltimore Countdown (game show) Ichthys

years or year is the letter s at the end necessary also year or years or is it correct if i say one and a half year instead of one and a half years in the us our culture generally refers to it as one and a half years below one it gets a little murky one would say half a year but you would say years if you're referring to it in decimal format anything other than exactly one would be referred to in plural with the s because you're speaking in plural units of measurement even if the unit of measurement is less than one whole if you're referring to it in fractional form anything that's one or less would be referred to without the plural form without the s because you're referring to a fraction of a year  Tour de France Luck Shit LOL (Internet slang) Mike Tyson EastEnders Ken Jennings Society for Creative Anachronism B3ta Nicene Creed Palindrome Good Friday Prayer 10cc Singlish Karma Dead Like Me Territory of Hawaii John Wycliffe Rapier Theory of conduct Press Your Luck Pulp Fiction Rape British House of Commons Mnemonic Shabbat Theodicy Warrior (wrestler) The Cure Nanking Massacre Summa Theologiae Philosophy of language Knots Landing Bene Gesserit Roman Catholic Church Heresy Amnesty International Scientology beliefs and practices French language Have I Got News For You Orange Order Divine grace New England Patriots Jan Hus Thanksgiving Paul Is Dead $ale of the Century Pyramid (game show) Pure Pwnage Bill Clinton Yusuf al-Qaradawi Ethics Charles Bukowski The Joker's Wild Article One of the United States Constitution Merit Prince Edmund (Blackadder) The Origin of Species English grammar House of Leaves Cyprian John Wayne Ayrton Senna Leviathan (book) Capital punishment Yeshu Romance copula American Football League European dueling sword Jewish principles of faith Authorship of the Pauline epistles Microeconomics Accrington Stanley F.C.

where did the word toilet originate from americans use bathroom even tho theres no bath half the time i like wash room that makes sense but toilet is it like blood let maybe urine used to be toi it comes from the french toilette which referred to grooming and cleaning in turn that came from toile which was a cloth on which stood a mirror and a wash basin hence you still come across vestigial terms like eau de toilette and toiletries the toilet then developed into a separate room with a mirror and washbasin for personal grooming and washing of hands and the face it was normally separate from the lavatory where you went to urinate and defecate in the th century the use of trains became widespread at first toilets and lavatories where kept separate you would do your business then go to another room across the aisle to wash your hands but eventually to save space and reduce costs the two rooms were merged there wasn't enough space to have lavatory and toilet written on the door so just toilet was written as a consequence what are actually lavatories are now commonly called toilets posh people may still correct you if you make this mistake  Dutch language Non-native pronunciations of English Received Pronunciation New Zealand English English English Pinyin American English Slovak language English language Regional accents of English speakers Indonesian language General American Czech language Greek language Phoneme French language Polish language Canadian English Spanish language Dictionary Italian language English phonology Quebec French Latin alphabet Australian English Hiberno-English Indian English Acute accent Japanese language Lithuanian language Southern American English Welsh language New York-New Jersey English Slovenian language Swedish language American and British English differences R__maji History of the English language Chinese language Rhotic and non-rhotic accents Tone (linguistics) Finnish language Scottish English British English Hong Kong English Hypercorrection Portuguese language Speech synthesis Trap-bath split Boston accent Diacritic Korean language Writing system of Spanish Southern Athabascan languages Cot-caught merger Hebrew language Standard Mandarin Mispronunciation Dialects of Mandarin Tagalog language Vowel Shibboleth Yorkshire dialect and accent Formal written English - regional differences Old English language West Country dialects Hungarian language Jamaican English Cantonese (linguistics) Scottish Gaelic language Newfoundland English D'ni language Arabic language Spelling reform Esperanto Grave accent Singlish Circumflex Ojibwe language Acronym and initialism Headphones Moldovan language Danish language German language Languages in Star Wars California English Old Irish language Second language acquisition Dialect Welsh English Estuary English Finno-Ugric languages Spanish dialects and varieties Scouse Tatar language Finland-Swedish Hindi Sanskrit Hawaiian language Lingala language

pet peeve misusing the word oxymoron my understanding is that an oxymoron consists of two words of opposite meaning put together to make a concept such as wise fool or intimate stranger although military intelligence is humorous and gets the point across it is a contadiction in terms rather than a true oxymoron doncha think thoughts oxymora can also be used ironically apart from their rhetoric purposes that is with their literal meaning in that sense military intelligence though not literally an oxymoron does in fact convey an oxymoron in its actual ironic meaning  Catechism Balfour Declaration, 1917 Central processing unit Orange Order Altruism Banknote Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses United States dollar Scouting Teach the Controversy Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs A Course In Miracles Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Gettysburg Address CRYPTREC Paper Mario Japanese tea ceremony Urantia GED Toastmasters International Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland Annuity Boy Scouts of America Survivalism Battle of Plattsburgh Chromatography United States Army H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Zhuge Liang Salmon P.

do you prefer sudoko or crosswords i was told we're either number or word people so which are you i do sudoko but my twin loves crosswords the more cryptic the better i stare blankly at them so which are you or is this a stereotype there's an excellent discussion on sudoku vs crosswords here http neilshepherd pages web com id html i do both solve and make both crosswords and sudoku puzzles crosswords rely on knowledge sudoku on logic so different thought processes are involved that make both puzzles very worthwhile if sudoku puzzles have one big disadvantage it's that if you make a mistake by the time you find out it's too late to go back and change firstly because you've got wrong numbers already filled in and secondly because it's almost impossible to backtrack and discover where you went wrong  Sex symbol Great Teacher Onizuka Indian English Shawn Michaels About a Boy Paris Hilton Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!

can someone serve out multiple life sentences in prison i thought that most people get only one life to life but people get sentenced to like consecutive life sentences wtf how the hell does that work why not just kill them they are going to die anyways in there that is the term life sentence to me the person doesn't really serve every life sentence that they are giving just that one i mean really u only have one life which means you can only serve one life sentence i really think that if it was something very big like multiple murders than the judge would say something like consecutive life sentences just to let the guilty person know that he will not get out on any circumstances for wat he did and the judges says it just so the victims family will be relieved that the person who put them through hell is going be away for the rest of his her life and probably theirs too i mean if you were a cat then consecutive life sentences would make a whole lot of since lol  Jon Secada Humphrey Bogart Hell Theory of conduct Philosophical skepticism Bon Jovi Hubert Selby Jr. Rocko's Modern Life Moral Politics Blood on the Tracks Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theodicy Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Calvin and Hobbes Phoebe Halliwell Social rule Rich Mullins Michael D.

handsome u s marshal for the past few hours she finally decided it was time to make her move pardon me sir may i take this seat next to you i feel so out of sorts traveling alone i'm quite helpless really she batted her eyelashes something tells me this may prove to be a very enjoyable journey after all matt barely looked her way you're not helpless maam thanks but i really need to be alone the woman mortified quickly walked away matt continued staring out the wondow lost in his thoughts lost in his pain i should have gone with sunshine the war memorial is so important to her then he remembered her two former lovers would be there as well damn by the time the train reached it's final destination matt was more than ready to disembark he fairly flew off the train car and booked a buggy to sunshine's parents' home it was the day of the dedication sunshine and her parents were sitting in the parlour with kevin and tom when matt knocked on the front door dannie yates sunshine's mother answered the door by the sheer height of the visitor she knew it had to be matt dillon sunshine had written her mother naturally describing the man with whom she was in love dannie oh dear oh dear baffled by her dismay matt followed her into the parlour sunshine looked up matt tom knew nothing about this stranger this very tall stranger calling on his sunshine kevin on the other hand had encountered matt on more than one occasion in his attempt to win back the affections of the lass hoping to avoid a romantic interchange between matt and sunshine kevin walked over to him extending his hand matt what a what a pleasant surprise matt shook his hand never taking his eyes off sunshine kevin took the liberty of making the introductions in a proprietary fashion he stood by sunshine's side hand on her shoulder none of this was lost on matt tom sooooo you're a u s marshal well ring a ding ding i just happen to be running for mayor of this town come next fall and i own the finest acreage this side of the potomac frederick yates sunshine's father that'll be enough tom marshal dillon please have a seat and join us in a drink matt thanks i could use a beer frederick we do things a little different here sir he went over to the serving table and returned with a tall glass a mint julip matt had never heard of this drink but he smiled and accepted it there was a moment of uneasy silence tom so marshal dillon shot anyone lately he laughed at his weak attempt of trying to make matt feel uncomfortable sunshine's mother gasped matt looked him straight in the eye yeah i shot a man four days ago actually tom oh really what for matt he was trying to steal another man's property i shot him through the heart twice tom choked on his drink and excused himself from the room kevin laughed very good dillon what a way to go to test a man's metal as you can see tom has no metal just a weak bag of wind really frederick asked kevin if he would take tom and go on ahead of them to the ceremonies kevin knew better than to protest matt was now alone with sunshine and her family frederick tell me marshal dillon what brings you to virginia matt your daughter sir he looked intently at sunshine i've come to stand by her side at the dedication i want to honor her late husband and all those who died in the war frederick asked sunshine to please wait in her room while he and his wife spoke with matt she left the room looking back the whole time frederick i am not a man who minces words marshal dillon let's get this thing squared away now i would like to know your intentions in regard to our daughter they spoke with matt for over an hour frederick matt would you please go upstairs and inform sunshine that we shall be leaving in a few minutes matt went up the stairs and knocked on her door matt sunny i just had a good talk with your parents i explained to them my deep regrets at having let you down back in dodge i also explained how dear you are to me how very much i love you i'm so happy to be here with you and your family i want to honor your mother i want to learn from your pa i want to steal your attention like a bad outlaw sunshine pulled him into the room they grabbed each other kissing passionately dannie yates came upstairs to get the two of them as it was time to leave for the memorial service she peeked into the room and saw matt and sunshine in their feverish state oh dear oh dear http www youtube com watch v y ow cboae to be continued tune in next time for the conclusion to lost without your love okay roll credits matt dillon james arness

wants to know can you write a little story that includes these m song titles i'm going to go through the alphabet nope this is not homework just some wholesome creative fun on ya morning has broken my dreams are getting better all the time madman across the water maybe i'm amazed mothership connection magic transistor radio if you want to answer please post your intent so i won't close on you ouch morning has broken on the fair town of cambridge sunlight cascades over the houses lawns and businesses of the city and morning commuters lazily make their way to work however one office is already open and doing businees by tradition dr frank mcgahee had begun accepting patients early so that he could go home early in over fifteen years of practice not one of his patients in the am slot had complained about the early appointment of course most of his patients were neurotic milquetoasts that couldn't stand up to their year old children much less complain to him about having to wake up early for his appointments and here before him at am this morning is the king of all neurotics captain psychosis himself tanner james in the tradition of all good psychiatrists dr mcgahee had purchased a large leather couch he had even hired a feng shui expert to come in show him where to put the couch for maximum effectiveness during treatment stretched out on this couch now tanner james was babbling my dreams are getting better all the time doc this treatment has done wonders for me he said contradicting this statement was the large marilyn monroe wig that covered his head beneath that wig were several sporadic bald patches that could only have occurred as a result of someone ripping out their own hair in handfuls dr mcgahee sighed in front of the couch was an old coffee table patterned after a louis the xiv antique on top of the table sat a full pitcher of water with little slivers of ice floating on top this was just in case the patient needed to wet his whistle in the middle of his diatribes however positioned just right he could use the pitcher to block the view of the face of his patient giving them distorted features that seemed to match their endless psychotic blathering dr mcgahee was tired what did you dream last night tanner mcgahee asked if only to focus the patient well i had this magic transister radio he began and this radio could pick up alien transmissions you know like from the ones who abducted me it seemed to have a mothership connection because i could talk to the fleet admiral himself for tanner it was always about the fleet admiral during the supposed abduction it was the fleet admiral who had ordered the he be released back to earth the fleet admiral who had saved him further tests yadda yadda dr mcgahee sighed again and shifted his view to the pitcher he sat staring at this madman across the water i don't know tanner i don't think these treatments are getting us anywhere you still believe these incidences occurred your dreams are still just as disjointed as ever and frankly i'm beginning to think of myself as a failure here maybe i'm losing touch with my profession maybe i'm losing my touch with patients like yourself maybe i'm amazed that you can function when you leave here at all but i think the time has come that i refer you to another doctor i'm truly sorry tanner i feel like i've failed that was as far as mcgahee got he was cut off by a sonic tearing sound as the roof above him was literally ripped from it's moorings sunlight and sky flowed into his office highlighting a now very stunned dr mcgahee what the that was when tanner james let out a cry in an instant he flew upward and out of the office by route of where the roof used to be his body getting smaller as it was pulled further into the sky dr mcgahee sat staring at the spec that was tanner until he winked completely out of view after such a quick and brutal intrusion the silence was now deafening and in the vein of all good god fearing psychologists dr mcgahee stood and made his way to the desk and picked up the phone and called his secretary and said lois please dispose of mr james file as he will no longer be a patient here also can you call a couple roofers for estimates and send in the o'clock as usual mcgahee returned to his seat and sighed maybe he was losing touch with his patients but dammit he still needed the money  Algorithm Factory Sewing machine Industrial engineering Glass English plural Quality control Plastic Arsenal Krag-J__rgensen Warranty Universal Serial Bus Product liability Debugging Solar

how do you say bald in plural baldes or balds i mean really you can say brunettes blondes reds browns balds probably reds and browns is wrong too you can't really it's an adjective not a noun your examples are also wrong it should be blondes brunettes which technically includes people with black hair redheads etc you could use the noun form baldie or baldy and pluralize it to baldies it's slang and not proper english but it would make more sense it's more accurate and proper to say bald men  ICAO airline code Friends IATA Airline Designator Patron saint Judo at the 2004 Summer Olympics Time zone Universal Postal Union Index of political parties Boxing at the 2004 Summer Olympics 36th Chess Olympiad United Nations member states Lists of office-holders ICAO airport code Global 200 Palearctic Football World Cup 1990 (qualification) Crown jewels Gallery of flags by design Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's 200 metres Korea at the 2004 Summer Olympics Gallery of sovereign state coats of arms Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's Decathlon Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's 100 metres Toilet Archery at the 2004 Summer Olympics Rock formation Marine ecoregion Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity National emblem String instrument Swimming at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's 50 metre Freestyle Swimming at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's 100 metre Freestyle Rail gauge Asia Women in Islam Dream Team Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's 110 metres Hurdles Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests Emperor National pastime Rocket launch site Imperialism in Asia Allies of World War II Standards organization Breakfast Eastern Orthodox Church Swimming at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Women's 400 metre Freestyle National Day Telephone numbering plan British Empire Swimming at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's 200 metre Individual Medley Fencing at the 2004 Summer Olympics Football World Cup 2006 (qualification UEFA) Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

feels the line separating reality from fiction is becoming too blurred u s marshal matt dillon and sunshine macgillicutty his girlfriend and annie's alter ego are becoming almost too real her love for james arness and his famous role on gunsmoke is beginning to dominate her life so she boards a plane heading for the west coast of scotland hoping that a complete change of scenery in a country she

road when she turns to see just who said that she crashes and now part four scotland subtitle you're a what annie was semi conscious when she felt herself being lifted from the car a passerby had placed her on the ground next to the car which went into a ditch man maam maam can you hear me annie's eyes were still focusing yes yes i hear you ooooooh when she was finally able to sit up she

can't be this just can't be dylan was the image of matt dillon it was as though the legendary tv hero had stepped out of the tv screen out of her countless stories and was standing in front of her annie almost in a whisper matt is that you matt dylan no maam my name's dylan funny tho my dad's name is matthew annie's mouth dropped opened you know just before i saw you go off the road i heard a

that be alright i'll be better able to check you out i'll have my secretary make the necessary calls regarding your car annie and the doctor got to his office dylan to his secretary did you even look at the map before you gave me those crazy directions his secretary new to the position was flustered i'm sorry dr stewart i'm very sorry sometimes things aren't as easy as they seem dylan okay but amanda please in the future give me proper directions annie oh my god amanda your last name isn't blake is it amanda blake played kitty russell on gunsmoke amanda no maam my name's amanda russell

you don't have a partner named siegfried james or tristan do you all three characters on the popular british show all creatures great and small dylan laughed nooooooo you know you are a very funny

references annie told him all about her stories and her adoration of james arness he laughed no wonder that explains everything she also told him about her experience on the plane dylan lay back down i think you must have had a concussion she laughed when annie described her husband john she was not in the least surprised that that is whom dylan had seen by the side of the road dylan you realize you have a guardian angel right he was fascinated with what she had to say he also felt himself being drawn to her after annie phoned her cousin describing her accident and where she was she turned to dylan i need to call a cab dr dylan insisted on driving her himself on the way to her cousin's house annie told dylan all about the stories she had written on ya he tried to be polite but finally said what's important to you may not be important to me have you ever thought of that can we please talk about something else his abruptness startled her she said nary a word they soon pulled into her cousin's driveway annie i'm sorry i apologize that was very rude of me annie forget it she got out of the car and picked some flowers she handed them to dylan thank you dr dylan it's not roses i want it's you and your time annie they aren't roses just some lovely wild flowers i love wild flowers goodbye when dylan got back to his office he headed straight to his computer and logged into ya he sat

what is the origin of the term get down to brass tax actually the term is brass tacks brass tacks is an object used in the popular expression get down to brass tacks the expression usually means clearing out confusing details and finding out the real facts about something the etymology of the expression is unclear it may have roots in the way fabric manufacturers used to mark out a yard in tacks on the counter so customers could buy their fabric accordingly another possibility is in the 's the us government issued boots for soldiers that were constructed using brass tacks to hold the leather soles on to the bottoms of their boots as the boots wore down the tacks would protrude through the sole and in to the bottom of the soldier's feet 'brass tacks' could mean to get to the absolute bottom of things in reference to shoes it is also argued that the idiom is derived from the brass tax of the tax put into place by the u s government was received as a direct attack on southern slave owners who relied heavily on brass products for daily functions on the plantation get down to brass tax was initially used to mean stoop to someone's level or deal a low blow in reference to the south's interpreted cheap shot from the u s government after the war however it took on new meaning in reference to the brass tacks in a soldier's shoes as mentioned above it is also noteworthy that the tax in addition to creating revenue for the government led to a sharp increase in the cost of many instruments tubas trumpets cornets french horns and other popular brass instruments gave way to flutes piccolos clarinets and oboes as the more affordable woodwind instruments' popularity skyrocketed evidence of this is most notable when examining civil war marching music which relies heavily on the beating of percussion instruments and melodies from the woodwind family brass instruments are noticeably absent the expression might also be rhyming slang for facts  Otaku Acronym and initialism Dil Pickles Hungarian language Urusei Yatsura Hawaiian Pidgin The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius Hello Kitty Questionable Content Dick and Dom in da Bungalow Lojban Yum!

what does wholesale value mean whats the difference if someone were to sell you something at wholesale value retail value thanks for your time wholesale is how retailers stores buy something retail is how customers buy it for example for one purse the store buys it from the makers of the purse like purses for each they then sell it to the customers for each making a profit the makers also make profit because it may only take them to make each purse so they make on every purse sold to a retailer so if someone sells you something at wholesale value it's usually a very good deal and cheaper than you would get anywhere else even when stores have sales they usually don't go down to the wholesale price because they would make no profit it's sort of like buying food products in bulk a small pack of chicken is a pound but a big pack is a pound but generally a better deal  Press Your Luck The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Shit The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Pinky and the Brain Amulet Countdown (game show) Theory of conduct Aphasia Belief Political correctness Autostereogram Big Brother (Australian TV series) Psychology Biblical inerrancy Nicomachean Ethics Singlish Bernard Williams CSS Teaser The Da Vinci Code Magical thinking Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas The End of the World (Doctor Who) General intelligence factor Consciousness Fortuna (luck) EastEnders Social rule Evil Luck Kingdom Hearts Song Numerology Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Spatial disorientation Donald Davidson (philosopher) Jeopardy! in culture Game show Crossword Memory Asperger syndrome Philosophy of perception Phantasms (TNG episode) $ale of the Century Quiz show scandals Meme Homunculus Amblyopia Grace Cossington Smith The A-Team Learning disability Irony Black Quizbowl Adult attention-deficit disorder Opinion poll Indian English Tetration Francis Crick G__del's incompleteness theorem 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Parting of the Ways Cars (film) Cylon (Battlestar Galactica) Stroke Joke Lisa the Simpson Hollywood Squares The nature of God in Western theology Teaser trailer Team America: World Police Human You Don't Know Jack Blindness Borderline personality disorder Motorcycle helmet Witchcraft Hypoglycemia Annuity Handedness Narcissism Simplified Chinese character Goodness and value theory Norse saga Cognitive science Battle Frontier The Far Pavilions Threshold (TV series) The Joker's Wild Traumatic brain injury Pixar Spanish pronouns Jumpstart 3rd Grade Stuttering Brain of Britain Anchor Rose (Doctor Who) Economy of Russia Confidence trick Charles Bukowski

had been there times before many years ago she wrote to her two cousins john and richard hayman the date was set for her arrival as excited as she was she did have one worry how will i ever live without my computer annie loved being on ya she spent most of her time writing stories and posting her beloved paragraph questions for others to answer of her stories dealt with matt dillon of gunsmoke fame her alter ego sunshine macgillicutty and matt were two lovers in the old west more specifically dodge city kansas all the characters of this wonderful show appeared in her countless stories she had made only one alteration miss kitty was no longer matt's love interest she was or rather sunshine was annie knew she was spending too much time with these stories they were beginning to dominant her life what had started out as a pasttime was becoming an occupation an occupation without pay annie figured that a little time away would be good for her she knew she needed to expand her horizons ever since the death of her husband john several years ago and more recently her parents puppy and brother annie was lost there was a time she had worried she'd be lost forever admittedly she loved her freedom having been a caregiver for so long but she wasn't sure who she was if she wasn't needed her one saving grace was her job she was a nanny for a wonderful family with whom she had bonded annie had something else going for her her indomitable spirit and her child like joy of life to read part in it's entirity http answers yahoo com question index ylt agjjjstu evvgxpthvozwwlty ix qid aac j x show profile info aa and now part scotland annie was enjoying her first class accomodations on the airplane she had fallen asleep and had dreamed about matt dillon and herself sunshine macgillicutty annie was truely living vicariously through her literary counterpart like herself sunshine was a widow annie had named sunshine's fallen war hero husband john after her own husband most of the things in her stories mirrored her own life very closely changed just enough to allow for privacy and protection she slowly woke up still in a sleepy haze she looked around a man was sitting next to her annie to herself hmmm don't remember seeing him before he was sleeping on his side his face partially hidden he seemed vaguely familiar as he turned his head toward her annie gasped could this be posssible it was http www flickr com photos sray she almost screamed he smiled at her and reached out for her hand surely i am dreaming said annie she watched as his hand rested on top of hers she felt his fingers on her skin he leaned forward and kissed her hi anniemac i almost called you sunnymac you know she jolted sunshine macgillicutty the heroine in her stories was often referred to as sunnymac by matt john john is this really you her husband john macgregor smiled his precious smile a flight attendent leaned down to speak would you care for anything maam annie yes yes i need a drink could i please have some cranberry juice after she was served john laughed only you would reach for a fruit drink at a time like this glad you never developed my taste for the booze but it was all a part of the bigger plan annie i want to thank you for all that you did for me in the hospital i knew you were next to me i knew you did everything you could to insure my comfort annie smiled as her lips trembled and you know when you stood by that window in the hall of the hospital and told people later how you had felt me cover you with love that's exactly what i did that was the very moment that our souls truely connected annie oh john are you happy baby john there are no tears in heaven it is a place i cannot even begin to describe and i'm not suppose to anyway annie what do you mean not suppose to john listen to me darlin' you're spending too much time thinking about things that will all be revealed to you at the proper moment we've been watching you you know you've been given another chance annie you're free now the problem that plagued us is gone i think it's time for you to spread your wings so to speak get away from the computer let matt dillon catch his breath and mingle with real people annie well i'm here am i not i'm going to scotland i'm trying john you don't think this was your idea do you he smiled and ran his fingers through her hair i put that thought in your mind annie baby your story writing is truely a wonder it brings pleasure to you and to others it brings pleasure to me hon but there's a fine line that separates reality from fiction can you still tell the difference annie wasn't sure she appreciated this yes i can tell the difference it just so happens that not a dang thing is going on in my life right now that is wonderful enough to replace my stories john do you expect happiness to come marching into your computer room you need to get out and grab hold of life hon annie held john's face she kissed him as passionately as sunshine had ever kissed matt annie i'm grabbing baby i'm grabbing just then the plane jolted due to some turblence annie jumped she shook her head oh my god i've been dreaming she saw a cocktail

grammar questions how can you tell when to use who or whom when using quotations like the one i used earlier should the question mark be out of the quotes or within the teacher's enthusiasm and obvious passion for the subject inspired students who had never before been interested in shakespeare why do we use who instead of what here when in this sentence its considered incorrect when the hometown crowd realized that its team was about to lose the game they started to leave the stadium its incorrect to use they instead of it find the clause where 'who whom' will go and concentrate on only that part of the sentence plug in either 'he' or 'him' to see which sounds correct you may have to rearrange the words to put them in the proper order if 'he' sounds right you go with 'who' if 'him' sounds right go with 'whom' examples may i ask is calling he is calling so it would be 'may i ask who is calling ' i wasn't pleased with the person she chose to deliver lunch she chose him so the correct choice is 'i wasn't pleased with the person whom she chose to deliver lunch ' the question mark in that situation stays outside of the quotation marks because you are calling attention to the words and not quoting something or writing dialogue you use 'who' there because you're talking about people a person is a who an object is a what the last sentence is incorrect because a 'hometown crowd' is being referred to as a single thing if the sentence were made plural 'they' would have been correct  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Wand Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Lord Voldemort Diagon Alley Harry Potter Rubeus Hagrid Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Fred and George Weasley Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Harry Potter: Book Seven Ron Weasley Hogwarts subjects Harry Potter in translation Neville Longbottom Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Hogwarts Order of the Phoenix Cho Chang Money in Harry Potter J.

can you come up with an entertaining addition to this story about lady minerva lady minerva was mad about her new paramour lord rochester but so far had not been able to bewitch him as she had all the others of course he was older but that shouldn't matter after all wasn't her power over men absolute she devised a plan lady minerva was mad about her new paramour lord rochester but so far had not been able to bewitch him as she had all the others of course he was older but that shouldn't matter after all wasn't her power over men absolute she devised a plan she had learned that he did want a real relationship with someone when she had posed as a fortune teller to discover things about him now she just had to organize an event to make him see that she was the one her mom had always told lady minerva that a way to a man's heart is through his stomach so she invited lord rochester for a seven course dinner that she would personally prepare and present out in the terrace of her citadel first she had the entire place get decorated with beautiful plants that all carried little candles hanging out of their branches then she made sure that there were gardenias and hydrangeas all over the rails the statues the potted trees and in the center of the dinner table the gardenias gave out an intoxicating smell while they looked innocent and pretty arranged next to the hydrangeas needles to say she had her personal chef cook all seven courses but the lady did deserve some credit for putting so much time and thought into the decorations and deciding which dishes to be served she even had a gigantic pot of night blooming jasmine imported from the neighboring kingdom especially for the dinner event in the end it was all worth it when lord rochester stepped outside his carriage in front of lady minerva's citadel he smiled approvingly at the dancing lights of the dozens and dozens of candles that she had strategically placed all around the terrace lady minerva welcomed him with a little curtsy when her manservant led him to her terrace lord rochester respectfully bowed and kissed her extended hand while presenting her with a bunch of fresh tigerlillies as they both got seated and the servants started serving the appetizers the magic of the surroundings were starting to work their charm on both of them the flickering candle lights dancing to the romantic tunes that were being played in the background by the violinist that lady minerva had hired the intoxicating aroma that was cast into the night breeze by the gardenias the beautiful blue and white theme of the entire decorations the potted birch trees lining the terrace that carried tiny candles hanging from their little branches everything seemed to come together the overall effect in one word was magical right before their desert was served lord rochester got out of his chair and asked lady minerva for a dance under the stars as they were dancing to the rhythm of the slow sensual touching music played by the violinist lord rochester saw the candle lights casting different shades of colors into lady minerva's winter sky grey eyes he smiled contently as he twirled her they were moving in harmony and in complete sync when lady minerva felt as if the cool breeze of the night had suddenly stopped and somebody had turned on the heat as their eyes locked she was sure that he felt the same sparks flying there was only one way to be sure lady minerva parted her lips invitingly and a split second later lord rochester had locked lips with her in a sizzling kiss the next moment lady minerva's stiletto clad foot popped as she wrapped her arms around lord rocherster's neck in a never ending kiss while their passion mounted she smiled to herself apparently her mom was right about the path to

about u s marshal matt dillon of gunsmoke fame and his sweetie sunshine macgillicutty hmmmmmm i wonder if i should have sunshine do her tarzan scream when she flies into bed next to matt the possibilities were endless she decided it was time to get outside and enjoy some swim fun at the club she quickly slipped on her bathing suit and cover all and grabbed her beach bag that bag carried her essentials it was packed with everything from sun lotions to her all important mattmusic these were tapes she had compiled that further implimented her scenarios regarding the future of the stories she was writing on ya it was really too hot to be outside but she needed a break first things first she admonished herself the birdbath needed fresh water and ice yes it was that hot next she filled a little bowl with the same this was for the little rabbit she saw from time to time in her front yard the fact that her house looked like grand central station barely phased her ever since she had adopted the habit of writing to stories a day on ya the idea of housekeeping was quickly losing it's importance fiddle dee dee annie chirped tomorrow's another day farewell tara one of her neighbors heard this and started laughing why sunshine macgillicutty have you now taken to quoting miss scarlett annie smiled and let out a crazy shriek hee haw save your dixie cups the south shall rise again the neighbor looked at her rolled his eyes and said does matt know how bizarre you truely are annie smiled played her air guitar and sang out my baby loves me just the way that i am her neighbor laughed hee haw annie when annie reached the pool she found it was not crowded hmmmm all the sane folks are home sipping ice cold cranberry juice well doggone it it's time for me to do something anything other than further my dodge city neurosis man i crack me up annie laughed at herself as she dove into the almost tepid water she played like a wild little otter with some kids she had befriended do it agin annie do it agin annie did her famous rendition of donald duck brushing his teeth for the second time she had been at the club for minutes and was already having a ball when she got out of the water she noticed two ladies off to the left she overheard their conversation well i think paris hilton would make a great president oh god i'm late for my appointment at the spa annie stubbed her toe as she laughed out loud and walked quickly back to her little spot man beautiful women are ruled by their face and figure more than their mind hee haw you idiots annie got out her cassett player and slipped in her tape within seconds the music her music started causing her legs to move to the beat she simply could not sit still when she listened to it lost in her world of james arness the dodge boys and sunshine macgillicutty she had no idea how she appeared to others around her one fellow stared in amused bewilderment as annie sang out cowgirls with guitars are really something special they can rope they can ride and baby how they play and that u s marshal is dancing to a different beat oh miss kitty today jest ain't yer day she jumped up with a start the man next to her had spit out his drink in his fit of laughter oh maam i am so sorry please let me offer you my towel your song was so hysterical annie laughed and laughed oh that's okay buckaroo i'm glad you thought it was funny he asked what she was listening to annie decided to come clean and really tell the truth she knew he was a guest she'd never see him again some of my best friends have been strangers she mused sooooo she told him all about her stories and her aspirations concerning them he looked at her thoughtfully i think it is very possible your dreams will come true annie thank you i believe they will the man left soon the weather was just too muggy for him as he got up to go he extended his hand be careful what you wish for annie for you most certainly will attain it annie smiled and shook his hand she remembered how a college professor had written that in her yearbook many many years ago the heat was once again taking it's toll annie couldn't stand it she walked quickly over to the pool and dove in the water was too shallow at the spot she had chosen and she struck the bottom of the pool she felt herself grimace and then nothing she heard her mother's voice calling her annie i'll get you baby in another moment someone scooped her up and brought her to the surface sputtering and coughing annie found herself in someone's arms it was the man she had been talking to he had come back to retrieve a book he had left on his chair annie thank you ohhh thank you i never thought i'd need rescuing the man let me see your cut as he gently touched her forehead annie was reminded of something that had happened years ago annie you know my mom saved me on different occasions in this very pool the man wanted to hear more she described her blessed mother both spiritually and physically the man gasped what startled annie looked at him what's wrong he told you that the reason he had come back for his book was because a woman had told him he had left it there a woman who fit the description of annie's mom annie wanted to run and find her but something stopped her that feeling started coming over her that blessed holy feeling the one she would get the one that told her that she was in the presence of a heavenly soul ohhhhh mommy you just saved me again life sometimes has a funny way of repeating itself  Aerial (dance move) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Japanese tea

why is the letter y sometimes classed as a vowel this is something ive never quite got my head around when i was at school we got taught that the vowels were a e i o u y but we never actually got the reasoning behind it and i would really like to know why sorry for those who weren't taught this or forgot it but the sometimes y version of the rule is correct just check the definition of vowel in a dictionary and you'll have the basic answer for example a speech sound created by the relatively free passage of breath through the larynx and oral cavity usually forming the most prominent and central sound of a syllable a letter such as a e i o u and sometimes y in the english alphabet that represents a vowel http www thefreedictionary com vowel note those two uses of the word vowel refers first of all to a type of sound one in which there is minimal blockage of the airflow with a consonant on the other hand there is significant blockage sometimes even stopping the airflow completely as with stops b p t d k g the usage of vowel for a letter is secondary based on this first meaning things are simple for a e i o and u because they are always used to indicate vowel sounds but y confuses people because in english it is sometimes used for vowel sounds sometimes for consonant sounds in fact when you start looking at it you discover that it is much more often a vowel making the same sound indicated by i or e does elsewhere if it helps our letter y is originally borrowed from the greek letter upsilon which is a vowel so when is y a vowel when a consonant the basic rule is this y at the beginning of a syllable marks a consonant sound and so may be called a consonant examples yak yellow y elsewhere in a syllable middle or end represents a vowel sound and so is called a vowel examples the many words with a y ending suffix happy funny this all may be easier to see if you put some words side by side with i words in which it represents exactly the same sound cry cries sky skies fly flies rhyme time lay lei soy soil note that i is more often used in the middle of a syllable y at the end consider all the words that change from y to i when adding an ending fly flies happy happier  Arab Semitic languages Allah Arabic language United Arab Emirates cricket team Arabic name Malay language Voiceless bilabial plosive United Arab Emirates Hebrew name Hebrew language Arabic grammar Arabic poetry Palestinian exodus Islamic religious leaders Salah Indonesian language Egyptian language Anti-Zionism Arab League Basmala 0 (number) Patronymic Wilayah Copt Arabic numerals Ney Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Swahili language Jihad UN Security Council Resolution 242 Sahrawi Zakat Economy of the United Arab Emirates Tawh__d Tel Aviv Samuel ben Judah ibn Tibbon Arab League and the Arab-Israeli conflict Writing system Asterisk 3 (number) Alcohol United Arab Republic Hindustani language The Stranger (novel) Letters of the Living Arabic alphabet Betelgeuse Dual (grammatical number) Arab world Javanese language Arab Revolt Arab nationalism Voiced velar fricative Translation of the Qur'an Haram Arabian Peninsula Roots of Religion Palestinian immigration (Israel) Kazakhs Gum arabic Right-wing politics Hashshashin Voiceless dental fricative Sistan and Baluchistan Trigonometric function Israeli Arab Imam Tetragrammaton Syriac language Sharia Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic Cain Classical Arabic Infinitive False cognate Adam and Eve Pita Names of the Levant Makam Mujahideen Nikah Mut'ah Malik Jacob Syrian Arab Airlines Philip the Arab Glottal stop Sunnah Arab music Jizya Jalal al-Din Muhammad Rumi Mary Poetry Libyan Arab Airlines Dead Sea Arab Air Carriers Organization Egyptian Arabic Palmach Names of God in Judaism Grammatical number

what was the moral of the pied piper i think i know but looking for other throughts or interpretations of it there is a clear moral to the story which is also a continuing theme throughout the play the importance of keeping promises the concept first appears shown at the outset of the play with the boy and girl the boy is reluctantly having a picnic lunch with his sister and she reminds him that he promised the consequence of breaking a promise is also illustrated in the pied piper s response to the townsfolk refusing to pay the agreed fee for freeing the town of its rat plague he charms the children away in the same way that he charms the rats away from the town this is both an ironic and serious consequence  G__del's incompleteness theorem Economics Logic Existence of God Willard Van Orman Quine Ontological argument Natural deduction Turing machine Extreme Programming Truth Intelligent design If and only if Propositional calculus Scientific method Philosophy of language Meaning Existence Falsifiability Fallacy Dharma Philosophical Investigations Axiomatic set theory Intelligent design movement Contradiction Paradox Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Meme Species Forcing (mathematics) Epistemology Evolutionism Deconstruction A Course In Miracles Essay German grammar Sexual orientation Kripke semantics Guns, Germs, and Steel Term logic English grammar Noam Chomsky John Wycliffe Creation science Cosmological argument Liar paradox Definition Teach the Controversy Algorithm Tonality Summa Theologiae Sonata (music) Mathematics Autism rights movement William James Topology Dictionary Marshall McLuhan Specified complexity Teleological argument Proposition Theory of conduct Concerto Christian denomination Jacob Neusner Creation-evolution controversy Internet troll Democracy Prolog Church of Christ, Scientist Pleonasm Philosophy Aristotle Substance theory Naturalistic fallacy Taiwanese (linguistics) Prices of production Transsexuality Ludwig Wittgenstein Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Authorship of the Pauline epistles Two Dogmas of Empiricism Tamil language Goodness and value theory Roswell UFO incident Strong atheism Ubykh language Guide for the Perplexed Surplus value Bogdanov Affair Criticism of libertarianism Spline (mathematics) Recursion Historicism Miracle Atheism Translation Deductive reasoning Paul Feyerabend

why do we pronounce try with a ch sound i think british speech maintains the 't' sound in 'try' a bit better than american speech so what you describe is really more of an american thing although we know in our heads that it should be 'tr' i think most americans do pronounce it ch and would be rarely corrected for it any british or australian actor who plays american roles would probably tell you that it's part of our accent tongue placement when making the sounds is very similar it's also slightly easier to make the 'chr' rather than 'tr' and we are a nation of immigrants after all native chinese speakers find the 'tr' sound very awkward for example i am sure there are others furthermore being linguistically lax here doesn't lead to any confusion we don't have any words in english that begin 'chr' and are pronounced 'ch' and not k so we all hear 'try' it wouldn't be confused with any other word in any english context if you take elocution classes for speech stage or singing they will still coach you on pronouncing and enunciating the 'tr' clearly even exaggerating it somewhat so that the word can be clearly and cleanly heard in the back of the audience  The Nameless Novel Crossword Wheel of Fortune Voynich manuscript MacGuffin I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Jumpstart 3rd Grade Khazar Correspondence International Phonetic Alphabet Others look into the Dreyfus Affair Esotericism Socrates Monarchy in Canada Zapatista Army of National Liberation The Raven Morse Code Kosovo Bah__'__ Faith and Language Policy Acrostic Scrabble (game show) Academic Games Password Shogi Esperanto as an international language MIT Mystery Hunt Cryptic crossword Shadow the Hedgehog Free trade Runic alphabet The Hunting of the Snark Junius House of Leaves Esperanto and Interlingua compared Swami Vivekananda I Am the Walrus Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh Guy Smiley Zeta Psi Locked room mystery Paranoia Agent Dyslexia Esoteric Christianity Resurrection of Jesus John Dickson Carr Archimedes Sudoku Extradition Prayer Now You See It Rebus Chain Reaction (game show) Amiga Power Thomas Lodge Priory of Sion The writing of Principia Mathematica Book of Kells Intelligent design Muammar al-Qaddafi Lingo (game show) Head of state Secret Gospel of Mark Vicarius Filii Dei Eucharist Hebrew language Ruth Bader Ginsburg Jabberwocky Quebec French Anarchist law Countdown (game show) Acronym and initialism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Richard Feynman Collation Call sign Epistle to the Ephesians Georgian language Intern Chain Letters You Don't Know Jack Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery Silent letter Franz Boas Victor Cousin One Tree Hill (TV series) Pyramid (game show) Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke H 2001 anthrax attacks Cyprus dispute Papal Infallibility Ichthys Status of religious freedom in France English spelling Scrabble Michigan State University Theodore of Mopsuestia Vehicle registration plate Peace Meaning of life Capitalization

what happened to spell check or at the very least grammer lessons does no one ever use the check spelling feature before they submit their questions i'm no genius but i'm sure that they have gone through some sort of schooling and should have practiced spelling no one seems to spell correctly anymore what with all the internet spelling or mis spelling that's taking place what do you think and then there's the scary way some posters seem to be combining text message style spelling with appalling syntax i make spelling errors sometimes but the way some people spell and write i can now understand how some english teachers end up as totally obsessed language freaks it's post traumatic folks colloquial english doesnt have to be totally lacking in style or grace sure write in colloquial englsih if you want to but its still gotta be understandable this is why we have a spelling standard that's a compromise between phonetics and history so we can have a consensus that people from varying backgrounds can learn to understand and read and write in regardless of whatever form or dialect of english you learnt as a child  Havelock Vetinari Electronic Arts Tony Banks (musician) Thud!

any english teacher please i know i've been asking this for several times already i've got some answers already but yeah i still haven't got the exact answer how to differ them toward each other cos i know even though they are all have the same meaning but there is must be something different among them first q i am coming in tomorrow i'll be coming in tomorrow i'll come in tomorrow what is the different between those phrases second q what is the different between those phrases above and these following ones without in i am coming tomorrow i'll be coming tomorrow i'll come tomorrow timberwolf thank you so much for the grade given to me but i am not asking for a grade amanda m i know that what i am asking is how to differ them when to use it ok i'm a writing grammar esl teacher so here goes to answer your second question first we use 'come in' instead of just 'come' in certain situations most obvious examples are coming in to work and coming in to a city i e by plane now back to the first question as someone already said the difference is the tenses used i am coming in present progressive i'll be coming in future progressive i'll come in future simple but yes i know you want to know about difference in meaning in fact in your examples there is no real difference in meaning the word 'tomorrow' makes it very clear what time frame you are talking about so any tense which refers to a future time can be used and we often use present tenses when referring to the future there is a very slight difference in focus as follows 'i'm coming in' implies you already had the plan to come in as does 'i'm going to come in' which you didn't mention 'i'll come in' implies that you made the decision at the moment of speaking if you want even more detailed information i suggest consulting a grammar reference which should give you all the different tenses we can use to refer to the future and the differences between them which are often quite subtle you can also try englishpage com good luck  Sociobiology Altruism Vocabulary Slovak language Big five personality traits Gene Goodness and value theory Personality psychology Gratitude Love Price equation Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Toki Pona Human Occam's Razor Japanese language Interlingua Theodicy Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Victor Hugo Alignment (role-playing games) Leadership Taoism God Numerology Fan (aficionado) Reciprocal altruism Otaku Dog Objectivist philosophy Utilitarianism Brahmavihara Quebec French Anti-hero Trinity Internet slang Horse Kin selection Individualist anarchism Jewish ethics Graphology Intelligence (trait) Mathematics Fascism J.

does any one know where the expression knock on wood comes from i know the answer i just want to see who else knows useless stuff like that thanks guys knocking on wood and the spoken expression knock on wood or touch wood are used as a charm to bring good luck or to avoid tempting fate after making some boast or speaking of one's own death the expression is usually used in the hope that a good thing will continue to occur after it has been acknowledged so for example one might say the rain looks like holding off touch wood or knock on wood i'm much better now it is commonly thought that knocking on wood has been a superstitious action to ward off evil throughout history some believe it has to do with knocking on the wooden cross another explanation for this practice is the pagan belief that spirits dryads lived in trees by knocking on the wood of a tree while making some sort of a bold statement the speaker could prevent the spirit from hearing him and stop the spirit from interfering however there is no evidence for either theory and the superstitions have not been traced beyond children's games of tag of the early nineteenth century according to steve roud the earliest documented references to touching wood are from and and concern chasing games like tiggy touch wood where you are safe from being tagged if you touch wood says roud 'tiggy touch wood' was an extremely well known game and it is most likely that the phrase passed into everyday language edit variations in some versions of the superstition it is better to touch the underside of wooden furniture as this is unfinished and closer to the real wood others believe that knocking on the underside of the wooden surface will avoid hitting wood gnomes or tree dryads on their heads which may anger the creature and counteract the good luck if there is no wood available some people will tap their head instead in gentle self mockery a more recent development on this motif is the act of younger men knocking gently on their genital region referencing the slang usage of the word wood to mean an erect penis in poland the versions of this charm is odpuka w niemalowane knocking on unpainted wood as the name of the charm suggests the charm only works if one knocks on unpainted wood in switzerland the german version is holz alange touch wood but while saying it knocking on or tapping wood is still required a simple touch is not enough in sweden the phrase ta i tr touch wood is commonly used as a part of the phrase peppar peppar ta i tr pepper pepper touch wood the double pepper also being used to ward off a temptation of fate it's often shortened to just saying peppar peppar while knocking on wood in italy a similar superstition exists except that one must knock on metal preferably iron in spain also exists it's said tocar madera and the meaning is the same a charm to bring good luck in denmark bank under bordet knock under the table is a commonly used phrase which is often used as a part of the phrase bank under bordet where is just another way to say touch wood likewise in norway the term bank i bordet knock the table is used in norway it is also sometimes used to stress that you're telling the truth akin to saying i swear to god that among christians in lebanon knocking on wood is a common expression some take it to mean that we thank christ of the cross for all of our blessings often while actually knocking on wood people will say b ism as salib meaning by the name of the cross some tradition has it that knocking up on wood would awaken and release the benevolent wood faeries that dwelt there this is probably based on germanic forest dwelling mythology when saint helen mother of emperor constantine the great visiting the holy land and seeking the true cross upon which jesus was crucified found the precious and life giving cross the cross was venerated by all the faithful in many public processions many faithful would come to touch the holy cross for blesssing and healing it was customary to touch the wood of life three times as a confession of faith in the holy trinity this act of touching the true cross became the earliest recorded histories of 'knocking on wood ' whenever the holy cross was put forth for public veneration touching it or as english translations render it 'knocking ' became common liturgical practice once the holy cross was transferred to constantinople and placed in the great church of the holy wisdom aka saint sophia christians continued this piety by touching or knocking on any cross or crucifix wood was the medium of the day for blessings and healings this ancient tradition has been with us for over years and has been a pious tradition to this day where people tend to touch anything made of wood but all interpretations of this behavior point back directly to jerusalem in the th century ce and the true cross prof anastasios zavales phd thd ecumenical patriarchate greek

spelling question ok so the plural for belief is beliefs if you believe in several things then you hold several beliefs the plural is not believes this is the third person verb form as in she believes in different beliefs my question is this is a common error once or twice when i was in college people corrected my spelling of the word beliefs even though it was correct so now i am using the word in a cover letter i want to spell it correctly as beliefs but i don't want the potential employer to incorrectly think i am mis spelling the word so is believes also acceptable what should i do should i just avoid the plural form and use other words convinctions philosophies etc do not spell things incorrectly because you believe your potential employer may have a misconception about the way a word is spelled ever the only reason you should use believes' is if you are using it as a verb  Mike Alfonso Masato Tanaka Boy Meets World VH1 Dinosaur Comics Peter Senerca Powerbomb Extreme Championship Wrestling L__o Delibes Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov United States constitutional law Chuck Cunningham syndrome Stamp catalog Pas de deux ECW One Night Stand Yahoo!

can you compose an entertaining tale using these phrases for the fill ins choose your own ending not h w life is he was standing in the doorway the castle looked foreboding i was spellbound unable to move the ice melted to reveal could this be posssible annie macgregor sunshine macgillicutty virginia scotland annie decided it was time to use some of her accumulated airline miles it was time to go back to scotland she wrote to her two cousins john and richard hayman they both lived on the west coast of this beautiful country and she had visited them three times before back in the late 's and early 's their mother who had passed on many years ago was her great aunt annie's mother had been named after her and annie as well the two brothers both married and with families lived within a few miles of each other annie hoped to begin her journey visiting them and then as before take off with her backpack eventually returning to them after several phone calls they had agreed upon a mutually acceptable set of dates man life is great i'll be in scotland in a few weeks hmmmmm the last time i was there my hair was long paul mccartney and wings were still going strong and my body was much younger much more pliable and sturdy she eyed her backpack are you out of your mind she called the travel agent made reservations for a rental car to be at prestwick and got out her suitcases ahhh much more sensible now all i need to be concerned about is causing havoc by being on the wrong side of the road because annie had so many frequent flier miles she decided to go first class so she could really sleep during the long flight she had but one big concern how will i ever live without my computer annie loved being on ya she spent most of her time writing stories and posting her beloved paragraph questions for others to answer well i'll do what smokers do when they want to kick the habit i'll bring lots of gum wait i know i'll bring some hand held video game of some sort maybe daily dabbling with a technical object will lessen the withdrawal symptoms i'm sure to experience annie knew she was going to miss writing her stories of them dealt with matt dillon of gunsmoke fame her alter ego sunshine macgillicutty and matt were two lovers in the old west more specifically dodge city kansas all the characters of this wonderful show appeared in her countless stories she had made only one alteration miss kitty was no longer matt's love interest she was or rather sunshine was as sunshine boarded the plane her excitement grew after switching planes in new york she was on her way to the land of her ancestors annie liked that feeling she very much needed a family connection she was pretty much alone in this world oh no you don't annie you are not on a pity trip you're on a plane trip snap out of it as she reclined in her very comfortable very expensive seat she started thinking about matt and sunshine she of course was playing out all her fantasies via her stories she and matt had what she considered the perfect relationship she grinned broadly thinking about their many escapades pretty soon she was singing a song that sunshine had written for matt annie was oblivious to anyone or anything she sang softly and was lost in her beautiful world where matt and sunshine were almost joined at the hip if there's no one beside you when your soul embarks then i'll follow you into the dark this song had touched annie deeply when she first heard it on youtube she knew that sunshine could have written it for matt annie fell asleep before long for once she had a dream about matt dillon in all his glorious splendor dream he was standing in the doorway the doorway of a castle the castle looked foreboding so did matt's expression he was looking at sunshine with such an intensity that her heart pounded his stoic face seemed cold unwelcoming sunshine was horrified then as if in answer to her silent pleas the ice melted to reveal a frightened expression have i lost you sunshine have you left me annie ran into his arms after all she and sunshine were the same person annie woke up softly moaning oh matt matt i was spellbound unable to move you freed me i love you i love you baby a voice ever so gently entered her thoughts when the lights have left the skies and when the lights have left my eyes i'll love you forever that's all that i can say that i will love you forever annie smiled these were words to a song that she had written to her husband many years ago when they were dating she remembered singing it to him in the last few months of his life it was one of her better songs and was dear to her heart annie slowly woke up still in a sleepy haze she looked around a man was sitting next to her annie to herself hmmm don't remember seeing him before he was sleeping on his side his face partially hidden he seemed vaguely familiar as he turned his head toward her annie gasped could this be posssible to be continued stay

what is the longest word in america i think the test ought to be whether you actually are going to find the word used somewhere other than simply as answers to this sort of trivia question as is illustrated by the first answer scientific names of considerable length can be generated but that seems almost artificial and many words that have at one time or another been hailed as the longest word in english are not actually used some have even been manufactured just to make them the longest word compare what the folks from the oxford english dictionary say in the link below and especially their observation that the formal names of chemical compounds are almost unlimited in length my vote would be for the longest place name in america the name of a lake which local residents actually do like to call by this letter name chargoggagoggmanchauggagoggchaubunagungamaugg an indian name meaning englishmen at manchaug at the fishing place at the boundary actually an expansion on the lake's original and official name of chaubunagungamaugg http www oldewebster com history lake chargogg htm this also happens to make it just as long as the longest word listed in the oxford english dictionary one they themselves acknowledge was manufactured though i think it then came to be used anyway if we disallow place names this would then have to be the longest english word in the dictionary pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis http www askoxford com asktheexperts faq aboutwords longestword view uk check that link for other contestants i must admit i was disappointed to discover the real meaning of the lake name i always liked the popular explanation you fish on your side i fish on my side nobody fish in the middle  University of Houston System Ontario general election, 1981 Rhinoceros University of Houston-Downtown The Daily Cougar Eug__ne Ionesco University of Houston Flensburg Isaac Newton Kaziranga National Park Le Morte d'Arthur Jacques Ferron Nidorino Mission District Sex museum Sugar Land, Texas Universal Time George Biddell Airy Aberration in optical systems Mansfield Park Ultimate Muscle Spirou Mirror, Mirror (TV series) Sir Rigging Netsuke Treadwheel Press Complaints Commission Unsere Besten Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh Staten Island Railway Reliques of Ancient English Poetry The Da Vinci Code Error correction and detection Solicitor General for England and Wales Walter Scott Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke Attorney General for England and Wales Isaac Newton's later life The Shining (film) First Sea Lord Sir Mix-a-Lot Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales Joshua Reynolds C__dmon Holes (book) Two Treatises of Government Robert Peel Arthur Conan Doyle Tosafot Knights of the Round Table Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy) Henry Campbell-Bannerman Christopher Wren Walter Raleigh Corporate governance John A.

missionary i am old and do not know many terms used by today's kid though i feel i'm still over the net i often find that word and guess that mmay be a position of having sex in my age i should not worry over them as that will be of no help to me still out of academic interest i want to know what it is state that or better still provide link to any picture of that missionary is a 'position' is sexual intercourse face to face woman on the bottom this term was originally used in hawaii when the 'missionaries' went and found the people there doing it 'from behind' with the woman on all fours and the man kneeling behind they said to do it 'the proper way' face to face which the pacific islanders called 'missionary sex' and i'm 'old' too but i read that when i read james a michener's hawaii in the early s so it's really not a 'youthful term' and it may be that to today's young people 'missionary' means something 'completely different' possibly refering to the actual 'people' who do missionary work for various religious groups i'd like to 'know' what the 'kids today' think 'missionary' means too  Westminster Abbey Westminster York Minster City of Westminster Monastery Town Gothic architecture City status in the United Kingdom Cathedral London Westminster System State funeral Cirencester Westminster Cathedral Apse Romanesque architecture Westminster School Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 7 William Dugdale Religion in the United Kingdom Canadian House of Commons Palace of Westminster Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom Westminster Confession of Faith Presbyterianism Abbey Cathedral architecture Surrey British House of Commons Lincoln Cathedral St Paul's Cathedral Parliament of the United Kingdom Glasgow Cabinet Throne Saint Denis Basilica York Royal Assent Henry III of England Statute of Westminster 1931 West Indies Federation Diet of Japan Prime Minister Constitution Cities of London and Westminster (constituency) Abbot Reading, Berkshire Henry Purcell George II of Great Britain Anglican Church of Canada Gothic Revival architecture Sinn F__in Architecture of the United Kingdom Independent school (UK) George Peabody Coventry George Gilbert Scott Southwell Minster Richard III of England Coronation of the British monarch Christopher Wren Canterbury Cathedral Peterborough Cathedral Edward the Confessor Norman architecture Roman Catholic Church Reims Government Canada City of London Christian Ripon John Blow Fountains Abbey Roman Emperor Governor-General of Australia Home Office Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon Government of Australia Westminster tube station Palace of Whitehall Member of Parliament King Edward's Chair St Martin-in-the-Fields Church of Scotland Charles, Prince of Wales Canterbury 10 Downing Street Matthew Prior Giles Gilbert Scott Durham University Lay brother Order of the Bath The Blitz Door Charles James Fox

scriptwriting what is a beat i have been reading through some sample scripts lately and i have found the word beat being used in parenthesis between dialogue from characters now i have heard that it is mean to signify a pause but then in the same script i see the writer use pause in parenthesis as well is there a difference between the two like for example jim i'm tired a beat you should get some rest too jane i'm fine she pauses but if you really want me to leave is there any difference between either one they are essentially the same thing in the context above it appears that the second line after the beat continues the same thought while pause has her stop her train of thought reconsider and then go in a different direction in any event the use of beats and pauses in dialogue is considered archaic and shouldn't be used in a spec script doing so tells the actor that he should stand there and do nothing and actors hate to be told how they should act just write the dialogue and let the actors figure for themselves how to say it of course there are ways to imply pauses for example the above dialogue could have been written like this jim i'm tired jim yawns jim you should get some rest too jane i'm fine jim starts to stand then passes out at jane's feet he snores loudly jane but if you really want me to leave here the dialogue is broken up by action a pause is implied but the actors are happy because they are given something to do rather than stand around waiting for their next line it makes the scene more interesting hope this helps  Internet slang RuneScape slang and terminology Web Ontology Language TLA Les Savy Fav LOL (Internet slang) Battlefield 2 Lag Unified Modeling Language SonicStage Military slang Acronym and initialism CORBA Fuck Taekwondo Belldandy Carl's Jr. Leet Camel David Firth Gansu Urd (Oh My Goddess!)

does anybody know what does hallyu and kabuki mean i was just wondering what it meant somebody tell me hallyu the korean wave hallyu is a new term which some korean marketing genius probably came up with in a boardroom somewhere hallyu was invented to increase tourism and raise the profile of korea in the world the term 'hallyu' means the love for korean pop culture or the appreciation of all things korean hallyu began roughly years ago when the rest of asia discovered korean soap operas one of the breakthrough dramas was a series called winter sonata starring choi ji woo and bae young joon after that more korean dramas saw their way to foreign shores and korean films and music started to follow suit korean marketing people started to see a korea centric trend flowing throughout asia hawaii and even in parts of russia they dubbed this flow the korean wave or hallyu kabuki is a traditional japanese form of theater with its origins in the edo period kabuki in contrast to the older surviving japanese art forms such as no was the popular culture of the townspeople and not of the higher social classes kabuki plays are about historical events moral conflicts in love relationships and the like the actors use an old fashioned language which is difficult to understand even for some japanese people they speak in a monotonous voice and are accompanied by traditional japanese instruments the kabuki stage kabuki no butai is a rotating stage and is further equipped with several gadgets like trapdoors through which the actors can appear and disappear another specialty of the kabuki stage is a footbridge hanamichi that leads through the audience in the early years both men and women acted in kabuki plays later during the edo period the tokugawa shogunate forbade the acting to women a restriction that survives to the present day several male kabuki actors are therefore specialized in playing female roles onnagata the best place for tourists to see a kabuki play is in the kabukiza theater in the ginza district in tokyo where it is possible to rent english headphones and see just one act of a play instead of sitting through a whole performance which not seldomly lasts more than three hours note that during kabuki plays it is common for fans in the audience to shout the name of their favorite actor just in the right moment during short pauses  Philosophy of language Grammar The Mind of an Ape Figure of speech Neighbours Question Philosophical Investigations Jean Grey G__del's incompleteness theorem Charles Darwin's views on religion Atheism Professional wrestling Professional wrestling holds Second language acquisition Probation officer Gender-neutral language Arm Translation Theory of conduct Natural language processing English grammar Eddie Guerrero National Kidney Foundation Singapore Lojban Transformational grammar Abraham Puberty Philosophy of mathematics Swingout Non-native pronunciations of English Normal distribution Goodness and value theory Big Brother (USA TV series) Torture Substance theory Mathematics Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Victor Cousin Foot Gravity NWo Jumpstart 3rd Grade Androgen insensitivity syndrome Francis Crick Quantification Split infinitive House of M World Wrestling Entertainment Donald Davidson (philosopher) Japanese grammar Rwandan Genocide Grammatical mood Immortality Abortion debate Jason Reso Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Propositional calculus Menstrual cup Joker (comics) German grammar Anglo-Saxon literature French grammar Emma Darwin Professional wrestling match types Indian English Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Doctor Dolittle (film) Dundas Square Past teachings of Prem Rawat Willard Van Orman Quine Adverb Charles Darwin's illness Singular they The Patriots Warrior (wrestler) Noam Chomsky Extreme Championship Wrestling Asperger syndrome Great Ape language Professional wrestling aerial techniques Ethics Dual (grammatical number) Mark Calaway Darth Vader Philosophy of perception Halting problem Crossword Philosophy of space and time Jacqueline Moore Breaststroke Genesis Phrase structure rules Vermicompost Myocardial infarction Inception of Darwin's theory Martial art Pronoun Italian grammar Chinese grammar

what is the origin of the phrase dropped like a cork leg in the s when amputee had recovered safely and sufficiently enough to begin wearing a wooden leg there were various types to choose from the broad division was between the expensive and more aesthetically pleasing artificial limbs also popularly know as cork legs and the common wooden legs of what we might call the peg or pin variety cork legs were often articulated and included various springs and joints everybody was walking about st peter's and the vatican on somebody else's cork legs writes dickens of tourists in rome in little dorrit these legs were called 'cork legs' in england not because they were made of cork for they were not but because the best kind of them were made in london in cork street common wooden legs by contrast did not offer jointed movement and were widespread among the poorer classes they were however also sometimes worn for practical reasons by those who could afford the more expensive kind austin writes of his experiments with both types after employing at great expense one of those london manufacturers of mechanical contrivances who profess to remedy all defects i found that the common wooden or jack hatchway leg is the best and most useful in fact no artificially formed leg to imitate the natural limb would stand the work which my active habits required of it of cork legs which he constructed from his own idea he comments although i could walk exceedingly well in a room or on smooth ground with my improved contrivance such legs are not suitable for rough work finding the springs which move the foot continually giving way i finally gave up using the artificial leg and have since been enabled with the more homely looking wooden pin from the above it can be deduced that a person wearing a cork leg is pretty unstable and will easily be knocked to the ground dropped  Dick Tracy 3rd Rock from the Sun Mark Calaway Little Shop of Horrors Big Brother UK series 6 John Lithgow Evil Villain Dick Williams 24 Hours of Le Mans V8 Supercar November 4 in baseball Hollywood Squares Clash of Champions The Big Lebowski Dudley Boyz New York Knicks Moby-Dick Hulk Hogan Dick Vermeil The Great American Bash Big-box store Bob and George StarrCade Warner Bros.

where did the name new zealand come from i am a new zealander and it is a shame that i dont even know this but ive moved to america and alot of people have been asking me where the name new zealand comes from and what it means ive tried researching and cant find anything of any relevance so maybe you guys could help thanks it comes from the southern most dutch province of zeeland zealand which borders the north sea opposite britain the province is made up of several islands which is most likely why it was chosen as the name for the islands found in the south pacific it is thought to mean 'sea land' though another opinion thinks it might be a shortened form of suevan land named for the german tribe called suevii if sea land it is quite an appropriate name because that is exactly what new zealand is even the maori names for the north and south island have sea themes with the fish of maui and the great canoe the links show maps of the netherlands and zeeland btw holland is a region within the netherlands but because it includes most of the coast facing britain the british call it holland there was also a kingdom of holland at one point but the netherlands is larger than that was  City of Heroes Morecambe and Wise Superman Magic (paranormal) Invisible Hand Supernatural Jumpstart 3rd Grade Free will Zerg Pok__mon Abilities Altruism Golden Sun Parachuting Expert system Radar Gandalf Gradius Microeconomics Events in the Wheel of Time series Toa Aztec One Ring Merit Libertarian socialism Independence Party (Iceland) Incarnations of Immortality Science Link (Legend of Zelda) Invisible Woman Fantastic Four Fluorescent lamp Ganon Darth Vader GURPS Age of Mythology Politics of Canada Goldstein's book Property (ownership right) Khazar Correspondence School of Salamanca Xiaolin Showdown Young Wizards Justification (theology) Coercion Invisibility Occam's Razor Castlevania Legends Mister Fantastic Shen Gong Wu Rule of St Benedict Magus Antenna (radio) Pok__mon (video games) Password Phaedo Druid (World of Warcraft) Force powers Cryptanalysis Wheel of Fortune Baptism Marvel Universe Ra (board game) United States House of Representatives Chaos Emerald Waverider (comics) House of M Theodicy Quicksort Ecco the Dolphin Michelson-Morley experiment Congress of the United States Where No One Has Gone Before (TNG episode) Filipino American Special relativity Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Advertising Spells of Dungeons & Dragons Sarah Kerrigan Peter Singer United States Senate Items in the Metroid series British House of Commons Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Northern Lights (novel) The Fellowship of the Ring Australian Senate Priesthood (Mormonism) Immortality Chuck Palahniuk Leviathan (book) Neo (The Matrix) Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Forum moderator Morse Code Peter Pan The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Presidential system The Queen of the Damned Super Mario Bros. 3
