is colloidal silver a heavy metal i am talking about the supplement taken internally thank you colloidal silver cs is an effective antimicrobial with powerful antibiotic properties that help destroy bacteria fungi and viruses simply put colloids are extremely minute particles suspended in water with a positive electrical charge the smaller the particles the more effective they appear to be some manufacturers claim a long shelf life while distributors of units that make cs as needed claim that freshness is important and that solutions weaken with time there is enough contradictory information available to maintain a state of confusion regarding cs its uses potency and safety for some time cs does not attack bacteria directly but rather deactivates enzymes responsible for the multiplication and metabolism of anaerobic organisms especially microbes cannot mutate into silver resistant forms as happens with conventional antibiotics cs acts as a catalyst and is not consumed in the process it is known to be successful against more than illness causing microorganisms safety and toxicity cs is claimed to be non toxic non addicting and to have no known side effects unlike silver nitrate cs can be used safely as a supplement drug interactions and allergic reactions are unknown one review emphasizes the lack of established effectiveness and potential toxicity of these products despite claims of no toxicity and that it is impossible for silver in this form to accumulate in the body caution is advised when taking large doses for extended periods of time the indiscriminate use of silver solutions apparently always in a form other than cs has resulted in cases of argyria the fda has issued a final rule declaring that all over the counter otc drug products containing colloidal silver or silver salts are not recognized as safe and effective and are misbranded colloidal silver should be used temporarily rather than continuously some doctors recommend that after using colloidal silver for an extended internal treatment period you should take steps to remove the silver from your system approaches include taking homeopathic silver argentum nitrate edta chelation or homeopathic dmps uses colloidal silver is commonly recommended in acute and chronic recurrent infections for short term use days when atomized and inhaled through a mister colloidal silver can be sprayed into the nose or throat as a disinfecting throat gargle  Colloidal silver Antibiotic Psoriasis Paracetamol Disinfection Antiretroviral drug Nutrition Chronic fatigue syndrome Hydrogen peroxide Common cold Water purification Poison Colloid Hydrogen sulfide Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Folic acid Methamphetamine Allergy Mercury (element) Carbon dioxide Food and Drug Administration Anthrax Virus Explosive material Organic farming Group A streptococcal infection Hay fever Bacteria Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Foodborne illness Vitamin C Medicine Aspartame Enzyme DDT Ultraviolet Thimerosal Omega-3 fatty acid Intravenous therapy Immune system Hypoglycemia Immunosuppressive drug Controlled Substances Act Cyanide Cocaine Biological warfare HIV Argyria Mesothelioma Nuclear fallout Cosmic Era technology Pharmaceutical company Water Pharmacology Ethanol Ulcerative colitis Methylsulfonylmethane Multiple sclerosis Tocopherol Insulin Ionizing radiation First aid Stomach cancer Plutonium Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Crohn's disease Herpes simplex virus Breastfeeding Hydrochloric acid Helicobacter pylori Epilepsy Acetic acid Antiseptic Traumatic brain injury Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Asthma Drowning Rabies Cystic fibrosis History of cancer chemotherapy Eczema Weight training Malaria Sterilization (microbiology) Maprotiline Cannabis (drug) Protein Ciprofloxacin Adverse effect (medicine) Gold

wiccan healing my mom is having alot of trouble with her back and i saw an herbal sachet in a wiccan book i was just wondering is it okay to do everything the spell says but put the mixture in like a sock so she can heat it up in the muicrowave and put it on her back i guess what i'm asking is is it safe to put crushed herbs in the microwave i'm sure the sachet you found in the wiccan book is based in herbal medicine so it's not necessarily an exclusively wiccan healing method but one based in herbalism and folk remedies it's generally better to not microwave herbs as it can destroy some of the medicinal properties so you may want to look into steaming it warm or something similar like dropping it briefly into boiling water don't leave it in though because then the medicine will steep out into the water leaving you with a tea that may or may not be drinkable depending on the herbs what herbs are in the sachet by the way calendula is pretty much the best herb for easing muscular pain so hopefully it has some of that in it you could also get some calendula cream from a health food store and apply it topically that stuff works wonders many blessings  Tea Herbalism Yarrow Coffee Traditional Chinese medicine Aloe Essential oil Witchcraft Natural health Beer Homeopathy Massage Birth control Patent medicine Garlic Alternative medicine Microwave oven Yerba mate Abortion Medieval medicine Herbology Naturopathic medicine Michael Savage (commentator) Health science Herbal tea Nettle Althaea (genus) Kava Citric acid Breastfeeding Psychopharmacology Stuttering Folk medicine Ice cream Caffeine Slow cooker Cannabinoids Nuclear power Wicca Comfrey Idli Rooibos Instant coffee Cocaine Liquorice St John's wort Complementary and alternative medicine Jewish cuisine Tofu Mid-levels Microwave Sage Chinese food therapy Teapot Cuisine of Denmark Quackery Cat Final Fantasy magic Explosive material RuneScape skills Chiropractic Bread Eczema Cantonese cuisine Nitrous oxide Word of Wisdom Vitamin C Reiki Chicken soup Medical cannabis Hemp Hyssop Lavender Dialysis Japanese tea ceremony Tlingit Onion Wiccan Rede Natural Hygiene Textile manufacturing Sugar Stinging nettle Magic (paranormal) Yoghurt Nuclear reactor Ocean thermal energy conversion Chinese wine Welding Stomach cancer Ammonia Abortifacient Anesthesia Water vapor Energy development Kitchen

does anyone have any info about kelp pills are they safe i have been doing some research on them and am finding a lot of conflicting info about them i have a breast cyst and eating dry kelp helps but its hard to acquire a taste for so i thought i would buy kelp pills it's the iodine in the kelp that helps with the cyst but i don't know how much iodine is too much kelp and in fact any seaweed is are some of the highest sources of bioavailable minerals on this planet they are incredibly rich sources of vitamins and amino acids as well the only time seaweed consumption would not be good for you is if you were hyperthyroid a condition where your thyroid were too active as opposed to hypothyroid which is the much more common condition and is where the thyroid is sluggish or underactive one of the most beneficial ways you could possible eat seaweeds would be in miso soup or sushi when one has a breast cyst it is imperative to avoid all dairy eggs red meat and coffee as these will worsen the condition and cause the cyst to increase in size other seaweeds that would be excellent for you are wakame arame dulse hijiki kombu kelp sea palm agar agar aka kanten irish moss there are many others wakame is the seaweed which is traditionally used in miso soup and in japanese seaweed salad please do not hesitate to email me if i may be of any further service to you you should also look at trying fraxinus ceanothus tincture by gaia herbals and vitex tincture by any reputable herbal company hannah kroger herbpharm gaia etc etc especially if your cyst seems to be hormonally effected  Japanese cuisine Acne Miso soup Bladder wrack Hyperthyroidism Ramen Tofu Omega-3 fatty acid Natt__ Vegetarian nutrition Food Hypothyroidism Seaweed Soybean Iodine Egg (food) Tlingit Folic acid Nutrition Kelp Thyroid hormone Wakame Guinea pig Miso Korean cuisine Vitamin D Hormone Vegetarianism Calcium Dieting Cancer Soup Tocopherol Algae Sushi Caffeine Cuisine of Singapore Cuisine of Denmark Prostate cancer Breakfast Cuisine of the Philippines Basic taste Sazae-san Breast Healthy eating Clinical depression Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Endocrinology Peruvian cuisine Aloe Chlorophyta Vitamin C Coffee Vegetarian cuisine Vitamin Edible salt Cheese Thyroid cancer Garlic Mushroom Chicken soup Kombu Organic food Tomato Breastfeeding Puberty Coeliac disease Graves-Basedow disease Ionizing radiation Origin of life Birth control Amiodarone Compost Herpes simplex virus German cuisine Agar Stuttering Emergency contraception Fertility awareness Herbalism Insulin Diarrhea Rooibos Autoimmune diseases

pile problem i had constipation during pregnancy and after my first baby with c section dr gave me laxative whenever i used laxative i felt good but when i left the medicine i again found constipation which one day turned out with piles i saw too much blood in toilet after that i didnt see anything like that thaen afte months i felt difficulty in passing stool i went to drs they said they couldnt see anything but gave me cream to apply which i didn't the problem was not severe now this time after my second baby i m feeling piles with every bowel movement either there is constipation or not when i go to toilet i find a kind of pinching sensation with passing stool but no blood and after that an hour of burning sensation but nothingelse i m scared of going to dr coz i have heard that there is no cure except surgery please tell me if there is any other cure is this cureable without surgery please tell me how to get rid of this problem it is not severebut it couldbe in future the best product i have ever seen or used is by michael's of texas inc i think it's called haemorrhex or rhoid x or something close to that you could contact the company via e mail and state that their hemorrhoid cream was recommended to you and could they pls mail order you some as piles or hemorrhoids for the person who didn't know what piles are are essentially varicose veins of the rectum anything that will help treat varicosities will also help your hemorrhoids these would include horsetail thyme butcher's broom rosemary witch hazel comfrey yarrow and any astringent tonifying antibacterial antipruritic herb any salve that contains myrrh goldenseal comfrey olive oil and or leaf echinaecea yellow dock will help you and there are many others as well your self treatment could be as simple as taking cotton balls dipped in witch hazel and cleansing the area this is a traditional home remedy i would strongly suggest that you also try a course of circucaps by sanhelios about for and available at any co op or healthfood store if they don't have them they can special order them for you i also suggest that you change your diet and strongly avoid foods that make one's digestion sluggish especially red meat and most hard cheeses coffee can actually stimulate one to go so it's not necessary to remove that from the diet there is a product called malt soupex used in hospitals and nursing homes to gently treat constipation it is just barley malt and is warmed and just given by the teaspoonful you can buy barley malt very cheaply at almost any healthfood store or co op i would avoid laxatives like the plague as it's too easy to become dependent upon them and they can significantly worsen the problem stop taking iron supplements as well as they worsen the condition eat salad and greens fruits vegetables grains and beans several times day every day ultimately hemorrhoids are just a minor complaint of pregnancy usually and will often resolve themselves as long as you are not bleeding profusely do not worry having babies too close together is not good for this condition and if you have rectal varicosities you usually have or will soon have varicose veins in your legs as well this can be serious as you then will have a higher risk or milk leg or deep vein thromboses dvt's i would consult w an herbalist and an acupuncturist as well as an nd naturopathic doctor regarding this condition as your screen name sounds indian have you considered consulting w an ayurvedic physician  Stomach cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Crohn's disease Colorectal cancer Veganism Folic acid Ulcerative colitis Dietary fiber Coffee Comfrey Cheese Medicine Cat Ayurveda Aloe Cuisine of Denmark Migraine Clinical depression Cancer Psoriasis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Acupuncture Essential oil Anemia Tocopherol Irritable bowel syndrome Garlic Breakfast Obesity Chronic fatigue syndrome Escherichia coli O157:H7 Stroke Traditional Chinese medicine Eczema Omega-3 fatty acid Dialysis Tea Vitamin C Japanese toilet Atkins Nutritional Approach Jewish cuisine Flatulence Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Gastroesophageal reflux disease Hamster Mouth ulcer Medical prescription Naturopathic medicine Chicken Dairy Menstrual cup Diverticulosis Chlorpromazine Dieting Diarrhea Multiple sclerosis Traumatic brain injury Alternative medicine Insulin Prolactinoma Organic food Adjustable gastric band Botulism Vinegar Stuttering Gastroparesis Hirschsprung's disease Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Althaea (genus) Food preservation Domestic rabbit Toilet humour Anorexia nervosa Herbalism Autism Acne Raw food diet Anal fissure Addiction Natural health Human feces Patent medicine

does self hypnosis work on bad habits hello i got quite a few problems with bad habits and i thought of self hypnosis does it really work to get rid of bad habits like drinkin alcohol smokin weed biting nails too much macdonalds and coke and yer i need to giv it all away please help hypnosis works on those who are highly suggestible but usually only for the short term it is used to reinforce what you really want to do so if you are not committed to changing it will do you no good it is kind of a support for self discipline not a replacement for it  Milton H.

my ears hurt my ears hurt pretty bad im not really sure what's wrong but they hurt from the inside maybe its from air conditioner because my throat hurts a bit too i never had though my ears hurting like ringing a little and i dont hear that well as if im on an airplane please help any advise ear troubles occur mostly due to bad cold sometimes the child will refuse to eat and may pull his ear never neglect a bad ear most of the cases of deafness can be due to ear infections in the early years many young children are partially deaf because of blows they have received on the side of the head these blows can easily damage the delicate hearing mechanism sometimes children stuff some foreign object into the ear canal and then forget all about it after a few days the child may complain of earache and there may be foul discharge during childhood ear infections occur after measles chicken pox mumps or the common cold chronic tonsillitis and other infections may spread to the eustachian tube and cause pus to accumulate in the middle ear cavity which is known as otitis media wax normally protects the ear canal from infection and injury but when too much wax is present it should be gently removed do not attempt to dig the wax out yourself you may puncture the drum and produce a middle ear infection which might lead to permanent loss of hearing sometimes the ear canal becomes badly swollen and infected particularly after prolonged swimming this is known as otitis externa there is severe pain and there may be tender lymph nodes behind the ear and in the neck older people with nerve deafness often complain of ringing in the ears nerve deafness may also arise from hardening of the arteries as the condition progresses the patient may not be able to distinguish between such common sounds as the ringing of the doorbell the tickling of the watch or the sound of the telephone other causes of nerve deafness arise from skull fractures following falls and traffic accidents especially if it involved auditory or hearing nerve or the blood vessels leading to the inner ear home remedies for ear infections and aches take some garlic juice and pour the juice in the ear it will help to relieve the pain garlic has a natural antibiotic if the pain is due to altitude change just chew gum or yawn to relieve the pain if pain is due to swimming usually called swimmer's ear put some mineral oil in before going in the water this should protect the condition one drop of alcohol after bathing can prevent excessive earwax take two cloves of garlic remove the skin heat them with two spoons of mustard oil when the garlic starts turning black burning then turn off the heat sieve the contents when the oil becomes lukewarm then using a cotton swab put to drops in the aching ear make a poultice of onions and it will help to cure the earache within minutes deep breathing exercises are effective for earaches and other pain because they oxygenate the body strengthen the immune system and open blockages grind a few holy basil leaves and extract some juice apply drops inside the ear boil cloves of garlic in some water mash them and add a pinch of salt wrap this poultice in a flannel or woolen cloth and place on the aching ear drops of tea tree oil may be effective in reducing the earache blow the nose one at a time and gently keep your ears free of moisture after swimming or bathing because a dry ear is unlikely to become infected after swimming or showering shake your head to remove water from the ear canal feed infants in upright position to prevent milk getting into the eustachian tubes do not allow infants to fall asleep with a bottle in mouth take a sock fill it with salt heat until it is warm and tolerable to body lay your head on it this may drain the fluid out use a nasal spray if nose is congested this will help to reduce the earache breathe in deeply from your diaphragm not your chest bringing air in through your nose pinch your nose and push your tongue against the back part of the roof of your mouth this will work a little air through your eustachian tubes without damage press a warm water bottle or warm bag of salt against the ear this will help to ease ear pain otikon an extract made of various plants including garlic and st john's wort is an effective anesthetic in treating the pain associated with ear infections take some garlic oil and put drops of grape seed extract in it and then put it in the ear it will help to relieve the pain in the ear take a small glass of orange juice about ounces and added a dropper full of echinacea tincture and drops of grapefruit seed extract gse take this times a day to relieve any infection avoid smoking and passive smoke as much as possible take vitamin c to help boost the immune system and fight infection zinc reduces ear infection put a few drops of hydrogen peroxide in the ear it is especially recommended for the swimmers ear  Food preservation Hypoglycemia Earring

what is the correct dosage for melatonin i was going to get some today but i'm a little confused on it some said contains mcg some said mg whats the difference hi nico the first few answerer's are incorrect mcg is micrograms one millionth of a gram mg is milligrams one thousandth of a gram therefore mcg equals mg mg is too much to start with it is best with hormones such as melatonin to use the smallest dose that works for you generally a mg pill mcg is adequate dosage for most people so get the mcg pills and take one or two pills one hour before bedtime if this does not seem to work for you then add one or two more for a total dose of to mg best wishes and good luck  LSD SI prefix Medical prescription Folic acid Melatonin Caffeine Oral contraceptive Kilogram Hormone Sleep SI Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Vitamin D Delayed sleep phase syndrome LD50 Insulin Tocopherol Parts per notation Apollo 8 Sildenafil Hypoglycemia Maprotiline Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Menstrual cycle Philippine peso Hormone replacement therapy Forensic toxicology Dietary fiber 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Diazepam Chlorpromazine Lorazepam Tide Methamphetamine Fluvoxamine Plutonium Simethicone Estrus cycle Doxepin Ketamine Guinea pig Chemotherapy Antipsychotic Nicotine Trimipramine Buprenorphine Topiramate Clinical depression Vitamin C Designer drug Drug overdose Progesterone only pill Acromegaly Migraine Ionizing radiation Fertility awareness Bupropion Paracetamol Omega-3 fatty acid Amiodarone Phenylbutazone Medical cannabis Cannabis (drug) Sewage treatment Homosexuality and transgender Niacin Birth control Amanita muscaria Polonium Clozapine Radiation poisoning St John's wort Antidepressant Naproxen Veganism Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Care Bears Jet lag ITunes Music Store Cocaine Standardized testing Hebrew calendar Chlorprothixene Tryptophan Pharmacokinetics Radiation therapy Daylight saving time Bodybuilding Bipolar disorder Haloperidol Micrometer Post Polio syndrome Political correctness SAT SmartAsk Growth hormone treatment Vitamin poisoning Salvia divinorum Ton

are sleeping pills okay sleeping pills can be helpful for short term sleeping problems when the cause of the problem is understood often short term sleeping difficulties are related to an emotional problem such as bereavement or to serious illness sleeping tablets should not be used for more than three weeks and preferably for no more than a week it's also best not to take them every night sleeping pills rarely help long term sleep problems instead doctors should investigate and treat the underlying problems sleeping pills may be used to try and break a bad sleep habit in some instances your doctor may be able to refer you to a specialist sleep laboratory which would assess your insomnia and sleep patterns are sleeping pills ever dangerous there are some medical conditions that make sleeping pills dangerous to take this does not necessarily apply to antihistamines these are obstructive sleep apnoea periods when breathing stops briefly during sleep often associated with heavy snoring breathing or lung problems heart disease severe liver or kidney disease myasthenia gravis a serious illness affecting muscle control psychotic states when people are out of touch with reality and may have perceptions that are not shared by others such as hearing voices in addition as with all drugs doctors are warned that they should always be used with caution for people who have liver or kidney disease it may be possible to take a reduced dose if the condition is not too severe you should not use sleeping pills if you are pregnant unless rarely the doctor decides that the possible benefits to you outweigh the possible risks to your child there is some evidence that taking benzodiazepines during pregnancy may be linked to problems in the newborn baby including breathing difficulties poor muscle tone cleft palate low birth weight and signs of addiction sleeping pills should not be used while breastfeeding either because they may get into the breast milk there are particular concerns about older people taking sleeping pills since the drugs tend to remain in their system longer this can lead to feeling tired and sedated during the day and may cause confusion and affect the memory for more information see mind's factsheet on older people and mental health all sedative drugs carry a warning about driving and operating machinery and it's very important to take this seriously a recent study has shown that users of benzodiazepines and zopiclone were more likely to have a road traffic accident research into a number of different studies of benzodiazepines suggests that the short increase in sleep time they offered was not worth the increased drowsiness and dizziness that followed and the increased risk of road accidents and how you can improve my sleep without pills there are some simple steps you can take to begin with make sure your bed and mattress are comfortable think about whether the level of light suits you some people like it really dark others sleep better with a light on make sure that you are not going to be disturbed by noise go to bed only when you are feeling tired if you don't sleep within about minutes get up and relax in another room for a while before going back to bed don't read or watch television in bed these activities will only encourage you to stay awake avoid coffee tea and other caffeine containing drinks in the evening a hot milky drink may help you to sleep get enough exercise during the day fit people sleep better don't eat a large meal too late in the day eating gives you an energy boost which may keep you awake try to relax before you go to bed so that you are not preoccupied with daytime concerns yoga and meditation could prove helpful avoid alcohol although alcohol is sedating and may help you get to sleep initially it interferes with sleep later on in the night because it's a diuretic increasing urine production it may cause you to wake up to use the toilet or because you are thirsty after long term use it disturbs sleep patterns and causes insomnia  Migraine Insulin Methamphetamine Obstetrics Pneumonia Atkins Nutritional Approach Schizophrenia Dieting Narcolepsy Opioid Meditation Medicine Common cold Trimipramine Obesity Anorexia nervosa Epilepsy Multiple sclerosis Oral contraceptive Autism Diabetes mellitus Fibromyalgia Propranolol Herpes simplex virus Word of Wisdom Gastroesophageal reflux disease Paracetamol LSD Stomach cancer Medical analysis of circumcision Malaria Parkinson's disease Drowning Stuttering Milk Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Benzodiazepine Drug addiction Weight training Neurofeedback Panic attack Abortion debate Equine conformation Cephalic disorder Electroconvulsive therapy Hyperthermia Hearing impairment Atherosclerosis Fertility awareness Aspartame Mattress Vitamin C Crohn's disease Health issues and the effects of cannabis Vitamin D Cocaine Clozapine Birth control

does anyone have a testimony of healing yourself w natural medicines or remedies i sure got a true testimony for you i am and suffer ed from severe osteoathritis which caused bone spurs to grow wild i've had six surgeries for those already i also have had an eczema from my ear to my throat and a mysterious colon condition causing great discomfort my doctor was never able to figure out what was wrong with my colon i have been on vioxx until they were taken off the market then i was put on celebrex i went through a colonoscopy and various blood tests in order to find out why my stomach was bloated like i had gas under my skin a liver profile came out fine all the blood works were with normal results i had a swelling from my left kidney to my lower abdomen and actually felt my kidney even though i wouldn't say that it was pain with all that did i fall downstairs and literally tore my left big toe in half that one required stitches to put it back together and the docs in the emergency room told me they had never seen a larceration like that in the past the vioxx had only treated the symptoms but never took care of the athritis itself and with the celebrex it was even worse because their effect reduce inflammation pain only lasted for a few hours and then the pain came back i was scheduled to get another bone spur in my foot removed and to get that joint fused because i could not walk any longer this surgery was supposed to take place on june of this year i was tired of it i had already eye surgeries six surgeries for bone spurs and a few other surgeries and i just did not want to go through this again so i started to hunt the internet for natural remedies to alleviate my athritis i ran across an article from this woman who had athritis and knew what the pain was like after reading her article did i go about researching the article had talked about glyconutrients and i have never heard of them before but after weeks of research did i decide to order me some to be honest i was very skeptical and went into this saying that i might waste my money but i'll give it a shot i was at a point where i would have tried anything in hopes of getting rid of the pain associated with athritis and bone spurs i started to take glyconutrients on may st of this year withing six days did i notice that the level of pain had gone down after weeks could i honestly make the statement that i still had some discomfort but no pain now after months am i painfree from athritis and i can also bend the toe of my right foot again ssomething i had not been able to do for years i broke it back then and never took care of it so it ended up stiff i was scheduled to set up the details of the surgery on june th and you should have seen the face of my doctor when i bent that toe the surgery was cancelled because the doc said that with such an improvement i didn't need surgery and whatever you take keep on taking it he also asked me for the name of the product for patients who wanted to try something different naturally i was elated i had not paid much attention to my other health problems but a friend of mine told me that my skin got a lot better and that my hair was hiny and healthy so i checked for the eczema that went from my ear to my throat and i didn't want to believe it it was all but gote all there was left was a slightly discolored skinsurface where the eczema was i also noticed that the weird swelling in my stomach had gone away and the discomfort from stomach problems had gone along with it i can pretty much document all this the best thing that happened though is this i am legally blind and over the years have i lost almost all color perception except very bright colors of blue red and yellow with yellow really being hard on my eyes when i watched television it was pretty much black grey white with bright red and bright blue like a royal blue in the picture when that color was present i never was able to distinguish colors while watching television and to my amazement has my color perception improved dramatically i am able to make out most colors now even though i still have dificulties with some like grey and powder blue but for the most part have the colors returned my fiance who saw me go through these dramatic improvements in such a short period of time has a few of his own health issues such as diabetes open sore on his leg ulcer on his leg high cholesterol and high blood pressure he started to take the glyconutrient days after i had started them and believe it or not after months was his cholesterol down to his blood pressure a svelte his open wound on his leg has started to heal it is no longer open his diabetes has pretty much disappeared and his sinus problems are gone it blew my mind when he came back from the doctor and told me that he is off of all medication except one and that one is kept as a precaution until his next scheduled visit in months maybe you believe that i am exaggerating but i am not i hardly can afford this stuff because i am on disability which isn't a whole lot of money but i decided that this was my supplement for the rest of my life a lot of money often goes down the drain for junk this stuff works so i am going to buy it from here on no matter what if you have any more questions feel free to e mail me  Carpal tunnel syndrome Tocopherol First aid Hypoglycemia

how do you make a personal lubricant does anyone know any ways to make a good personal lubricant i mean there has to be a home made version somewhere right i tried yahoo search but nothin anyone have any ideas let me be more specific a personal lube u can use during sex so baby oil crisco water and saliva aren't the greatest options saliva and water are the best though except that water doesn't lubricate very well and saliva can cause urinary tract infections in girls k let me add a lil more info everyone who is sayin get her excited you do realize that there are a lot of girls whose bodies don't produce a whole lot of natural lube heat these together level tsp sodium alginate and cup water in a covered non metal pan until completely dissolved use very low heat and stir with a wooden spoon handle it takes a fairly long time to get it perfectly smooth after cooling pour into a small dispenser bottle keep the remainder refrigerated mix and heat tsp cornstarch and cup water until completely dissolved in a covered saucepan use non metal dishes and a non metal stirring spoon once it has reached a boil the contents should become more viscous and somewhat resemble the consistency of gelatin remove from the stove allow the solution to cool at room temperature do not put it in the refridgerator or freezer it will cause the solution to form a skin that is a lot harder than the rest the finished product should jiggle like jello pour some into dispenser bottle refrigerate remainder p s oil based lubricants such as vaseline dissolve latex and are likely to reduce the effectiveness of latex condoms oils tend to heat up with the friction and you might end up with inflammated you know what use something water based aloe vera herb is easily washable try it lubricants containing glycerin may cause or exacerbate vaginal yeast infections in persons who are susceptible vegetable based oils like rice bran oil or coconut oil may cultivate pathogens ginger is a warm peppery and spicy stimulant not a lubricant helpful hints for treating dry vaginal walls drink at least two quarts of water and or herbal tea every day exercise the pc muscle pubococcygeus or do kegel exercises one of the fringe benefits of using soy isoflavones with genistein and daidzein aka phytoestrogens natural plant estrogens is that they can eliminate vaginal dryness in many women because isoflavones have estrogenic effects without the risk of estrogen therapy another thing you may want to try is applying teaspoon of natural progesterone cream intravaginally once a day you can insert a vitamin e capsule intravaginally for lubrication and to ease the pain of dryness no need to break open the capsule the ph of your body will do the job this is one of the least expensive most natural and effective ways of treating vaginal dryness just check the outer coating of the capsule first to make sure there are no sharp areas so that you don't scratch the vaginal area when inserting you can also cut open the capsule and place the vitamin e oil in the palm of your hand then put some on your finger and insert it into your vagina again make sure you have no nails that are sharp which might cause scratching or irritation aloe vera slippery elm paste is often used to soothe and lubricate an inflamed dry vagina mix enough slippery elm powder into some aloe vera gel to form a thick paste apply inside the lips and up into the vagina it will feel very cool and soothing homeopathic or herbal methodolgy of treating vaginal dryness tincture of motherwort drops twice a day you can also take tincture of dong quoi drops a day or use the caplets but don't use dong quoi if you have fibroid tumors  Fecal incontinence Oral sex Bread Androgen insensitivity syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fisting Casting Veganism Oral contraceptive Soap Breastfeeding Safe sex Soy protein Ice cream Cocaine Cat Sex toy Thermal power station Beer Dyspareunia Yerba mate Intravenous therapy Herpes simplex virus Fertility awareness Internal ballistics Hamster Cuisine of the Philippines Knife Milk Biodiesel Cantonese cuisine Orgasm Pottery Idli Masturbation Sexual dysfunction Fire extinguisher Ammonia Diarrhea Yarrow Progesterone Paint Homeopathy Hemp Intersex surgery Medical analysis of circumcision Glycerin Puberty Tattoo Anal masturbation Acetic acid Tlingit Japanese tea ceremony Essential oil Hyperthermia Gelatin Champagne (beverage) Chocolate Mayonnaise Plastic Kosher foods Cancer Ceramics Sexual intercourse Food preservation Nuclear power Equine conformation Body piercing Water purification Soybean Soy milk Explosive material Sulfuric acid Cookware and bakeware

how would you help a teenager break marijuana addiction there's not a true addiction to marijuana psychological slight physical minimum the addiction to marijuana is more a personality addiction in my opinion it's a social thing in the teen years and a proven anti depressant so it provides the teen with more than a few excellent reasons to use it unfortunately the conern is that they will succumb to overuse of the drug reliance upon the drug or in some other way mess up their life so in a sense it's a drug that can be benificial to a teenager and highly dangerous at the same time to stop your teen from using marijuana requires the process of finding out why your teen truly enjoys marijuana addiction is a term way too early for teenage marijuana use even if the teen is using it regularly at that stage of life especially marijuana use has a purpose as mentioned above if the child smokes it socially as mainly a get together type of thing you won't likely be able to easily remove the habit if it is something deeper such as use as an anti depressant or as a means to make things fun there might be some underlying issues that can be worked on which might allieviate or remove the problem any quick tricks or hard treatments might stop the drug use for a short time but it will only perpetuate the reasons for the drug use i am of the strong opinion that understanding of the teen is more important that immediate removal if you met an adult with a problem with drinking or drugs and you simply said you're grounded would he quit so how can we expect our young adults to completely adhere to advice simply because we know it is sound if you don't understand the teen you will never fully get the teen to understand you you can hammer your position upon him her all you desire and they will still be confident that they know something you don't so in short if you want to beat a child's addiction as it was called you have to learn why the child even has the addiction  Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Motivation Addiction Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Alcoholics Anonymous Drug abuse Tobacco smoking Drug addiction Arguments for and against drug prohibition Cannabis (drug) Alcoholism Abortion debate Controlled Substances Act Adolescence Cocaine Transsexuality Illegal drug trade Sexual addiction Drug test Asperger syndrome Prohibition (drugs) Infantilism Human sexual behavior Goodness and value theory One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule Procrastination Prostate cancer The Beach Boys Second language acquisition Traumatic brain injury Anxiety Consensual crime Science Teenage suicide Medical cannabis Medicine Drug policy of the Netherlands Autism Expert system Sexual orientation Clinical depression Suicide Religion Psychology Legal issues of cannabis Dragon Booster Neuro-linguistic programming David Hume Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Nicomachean Ethics Existence of God Causality Domestic violence Transactional analysis Annuity Sigmund Freud Cannabis cultivation Bradley Nowell Motion picture rating system Psychosis Ethics Theory of conduct National Institute on Drug Abuse Happiness Narcotic Only Fools and Horses Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Aquemini Methamphetamine Scientology beliefs and practices Narcolepsy Iggy Pop Stomach cancer Elvis Presley Divorce Social psychology Intelligent design Reiki Self-harm Psoriasis Kurt Cobain Breastfeeding The Sims 2 Contract Traumatic incident reduction Daredevil Surveillance Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Sly & the Family Stone Teenage pregnancy Psychology of religion Bipolar disorder Cancer Narcissism
