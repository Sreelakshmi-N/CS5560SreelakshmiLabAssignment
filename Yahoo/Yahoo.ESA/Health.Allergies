flea problems okay out cats had fleas and now there everywher in my house my mom bought a fogger and did the downstairs twice they are still there she also did the upstairs and then she spayered the house with this flea killer help what do u do also i have about flea bites on my left foot and ankle and on my right if i get to many bites can it kill me or do anything harmful to me look into diatamaceous earth de it is a natural earth product created from pulverized fossilized crustaceans as a powder it acts like billions of tiny tiny little razorblades that slash the flesh of fleas and other pests so that they dehydrate and die this is not a poison and is totally non toxic and safe to pets and humans because it is not a poison there is no way for fleas to build up an immunity so it can be used as frequently and for as long as needed some exterminators can put this stuff down for you but you can do it yourself you will want to take precautions when spreading it to be sure that children and pets are not around and to be sure and protect your eyes and do not inhale the powder because it can be irritating to the nose and eyes until the dust settles you probably should wear a long sleeved shirt and maybe even gloves for the same reason it's a good idea to shampoo your carpet before spreading this stuff because it settles into the nap of the carpet and is effective for months to a years but only if you don't shampoo the carpet once it is down you can also spread de outside you can safely use it on hardwood floors and floor tiles use it in the attic and if you have a basement use it there too it does kill spiders and roaches you should be able to find de at any feed store it's been awhile since i priced it at that time it cost between cents to per pound at some feedstores you will only be able to purchase it in pound pkgs at others you can buy it from bulk and purchase anything from a few ounces to as many pounds as you can carry this is an extremely fine powder so a little goes a long way  Cat Shampoo Drill bit Carbon dioxide Flea Hamster Illegal drug trade Tobacco Stairway Sento Beetle Technetium Animal testing Domestic rabbit Air pollution Pet skunk Carpet Minor Harry Potter Beasts Depleted uranium Sesshomaru Asbestos RuneScape weapons Mosquito Guinea pig Diatomaceous earth Blood (computer game) Uranium RuneScape locations Diseases of the honeybee Use of poison gas in World War I Welding Rabies Fire extinguisher Coffee Clothing Insect Tattoo Shark Alcohol fuel Red Hot Chili Peppers RuneScape quests Characters of Naruto Thimerosal Combine (Half-Life 2) Gypsy moth Explosive material Dairy Iron Animal Crossing Basement Ammunition American Alligator Ranma __ characters Cigarette One Piece minor characters Breastfeeding Poison Fire fighting Castle of the Winds Diving Hunting Chemical warfare Autonomous building Pesticide Aluminium Plutonium Energy development Chocolate Methamphetamine Hand grenade Tiny Toon Adventures DDT Helium Spider Wal-Mart 2001 anthrax attacks Richard Chase Inflation Hay fever M16 (rifle) Nuclear power Zinc Carbon Battlebots Diving suit Fluorescent lamp Shaggy dog story Cocaine The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Cochineal Saw II

how long do allergy shots take i am allergic to cats but i love them more than any other pet we couldn't have a cat at our house because it affected my mom more than it affected me i am about to move out and get a place on my own i feel the need to get a cat to keep me company and i miss having one so much i plan on getting shots to stop me from being allergic the question is how long do shots take if the allergic reaction isn't that bad around cats would it just be okay to own one while i am getting the shots please let me know the shots are an ongoing thing they are to help you control your allergies while you are around the animal or whatever you are allergic to i have cat allergies and recently got a cat i've been taking hour claritin and it helps tremendously also there are wipes that you can use on the cat to reduce the allergen good luck with that because my cat runs like the dickens when i pull them out but they do help also make sure you brush your cat regularly to remove the hair and dander vacuum your carpets and furniture obsessively if you live in a place with hardwood floors that's even better the best thing for you but hardest thing for the cat will be if you keep it out of your bedroom it's good to have your bedroom cat free so that you can breathe at night and give your sinuses a break from the dander also when you are picking out a cat try to go for short hair versus long hair and i've read that female cats aren't as hard on allergy sufferers as male cats keep in mind if you get a kitten versus an adult cat your allergies to them may get worse as he she grows the allergy is really to the saliva and kittens don't have as much of a build up of dried saliva on their coats as cats do  Hay fever Cat Asthma House dust mite Dog Peanut Tooth Pitaten RuneScape quests Urinary incontinence Guinea pig Feral cat The Fairly OddParents Tattoo Havanese Fancy rat The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Shaggy dog story Flea Phoebe Buffay's songs Procrastination Vacuum cleaner Eczema Air pollution Insomnia Azumanga Daioh Upholstery Kodocha Ranma __ characters Immunoglobulin E Tarantula Food allergy Pet skunk Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder The Adventures of Pete & Pete Food Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Garfield Domestic rabbit Ferret Carpet Red Dwarf characters Multiple chemical sensitivity Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Common cold Kitten Air purifier Cornish Rex Darkwing Duck 2000 Australian Grand Prix Wood Tooth enamel Manx (cat) Ron and Fez Charles Dickens Cocaine Sin City Hamster Xiaolin Showdown Friends The Inside Antihistamine Phoebe Halliwell Saved by the Bell Series finale Care Bears Social rule Great Teacher Onizuka John F.

does benedryl help with peanut allergies my child actually ate half of a roasted cashew and had similar allergic reaction to peanuts i also read today that cashew have a greater allergic affect than peanuts yes people with peanut allergies are sometimes told by their doctors to keep benadryl with them in case they are out somewhere and begin to have a reaction however nut allergies can be quite severe and deadly and if you suspect that your child may be allergic to nuts i would strongly encourage you to take him to a doctor and get this verified some kids with nut allergies can go into anaphylactic shock quickly even if they do something as simple as shake hands with someone who has just eaten a peanut butter sandwich it's not an allergy you should play guessing games with cashews do seem to trigger stronger reactions in some people with nut allergies please take your child in for allergy testing and some professional advice on how best to handle this condition nut allergies are so tricky nuts just seem to be in everything you know even in things you don't expect them to be in you will need some professional advice on how to manage this condition take heart however in knowing that it's one of those allergies that kids oftentimes grow out of as they get older so it may not be something they have to deal with forever good luck  Peanut Allergy Nut (fruit) Food allergy Peanut butter Cashew Asthma Hay fever Food Anaphylaxis Eczema Conjunctivitis Immunoglobulin E Tattoo Multiple chemical sensitivity Mast cell Latex allergy Urinary incontinence Crohn's disease Chronic fatigue syndrome Medicine Mushroom hunting Combat stress reaction Sandwich Common cold Shock Clomipramine Hypersensitivity Arguments for and against drug prohibition The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Coeliac disease Protein Psoriasis Tarantula Monosodium glutamate Cigarette Smoking Man Peanut butter and jelly sandwich Insulin First aid Peanuts Bread The Caves of Androzani Spider Theory of conduct Omega-3 fatty acid Diarrhea Baseball Common Hazel Propranolol Macadamia nut Oreo Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cuisine of Denmark Sulfasalazine Porridge Rheumatoid arthritis Passover Explosive material Promethazine Vegetarianism Violin Hypoglycemia Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Adult attention-deficit disorder Soybean Clancy Wiggum Cuisine of the Philippines Butter Homeopathy Internal ballistics Debugging Controversies in autism Urticaria Goa Ebola Spidey Super Stories Almond SpongeBob SquarePants Angioedema Stuttering Veganism Scar Cold Stone Creamery Elvis Presley Biodiesel Fantastic Four Chili con carne Tuberculin Dieting Meat analogue Chimera (genetics) Microeconomics The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Milton H.

question about chronic hives what are the symptoms what are the effects what is the cause what can be done to stop it or any other helpful information please and thanks question about chronic hives what are the symptoms hives appear as small round wheals rings or large patches and may change shape they usually itch and may be surrounded by a red flare hives tend to occur in batches individual hives can last from four to hours as each hive disappears other new hives may develop about percent of people with chronic hives also have angioedema signs and symptoms of angioedema include large welts or swelling of the skin that may occur around the eyes and lips hands feet genitalia and inside the throat swelling in the throat can obstruct breathing and requires emergency treatment what are the effects what is the cause when people get hives they often think it is an allergic reaction but hives can be triggered by physical factors such as heat cold exercise sunlight stress sustained pressure on a skin area such as from a belt or shoulder strap a sudden increase in body temperature from a fever or a hot bath or shower or from an irritating chemical cosmetic or soap applied to the skin hives also can be one symptom of a whole body systemic allergic reaction to something that was inhaled pollens animal dander molds injected insect stings or bites especially bee stings or injected medication ingested foods tree nuts fish and shellfish dairy products legumes especially peanuts food additives medications such as penicillin or aspirin what can be done to stop it treatment of urticaria treatment depends on which type or types of urticaria you have oral antihistamines control wealing and itching for the majority of patients with urticaria they do not affect the underlying cause of the rash antihistamines may need to be taken intermittently or continuously until the underlying tendency to urticaria disappears non sedating antihistamines loratidine fexofenadine terfenadine cetirazine and astemizole are less likely to cause drowsiness than the less expensive conventional antihistamines they may be unsuitable in pregnancy terfenadine and astemizole may increase the risk of abnormal heart rhythms they should be avoided if you have heart disease or you are also taking erythromycin ketoconazole and some other medications fexofenadine loratidine desloratidine and cetirazine are safe if the first antihistamine you try is not effective consult your doctor you may need to increase the dose or use a different drug sometimes a combination of antihistamines works better than a single type alone adding h blockers such as cimetidine ranitidine can also reduce urticaria but these medications are more often prescribed to reduce stomach acidity urticaria that fails to clear with antihistamines may be helped by oral steroids prednisone are useful for severe acute urticaria but unsuitable long term because of serious adverse effects ultraviolet radiation treatment narrowband uvb or puva antibiotics and antifungal agents used to clear an assumed underlying infection or for non specific anti inflammatory action immunosuppressive medications ciclosporin plasmapheresis antifibrinolytic agents tranexamic acid androgenetic steroids such as danazol tricyclic medications such as amitriptyline nortriptyline and doxepin which have antihistaminic and neuropathic properties or any other helpful information please and thanks  Food allergy Fibromyalgia Anthrax Mesothelioma Cardiovascular disease Rheumatoid arthritis Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug AIDS Aortic dissection Glucocorticoid Diabetic neuropathy Diseases of the honeybee Analgesic Diarrhea Cephalic disorder Syphilis Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cardiac arrhythmia Aspergillosis Sickle-cell disease Trimipramine Vitamin C Drug abuse H2-receptor antagonist

what can an allergist do for me i have this appointment with an allergist in an attempt to control my crazy allergies however i'm not very optimistic about what's going to come out of it i have to take or tylenol allergy everyday just to make it through and that's literally just to make it through it's doesn't control the symptoms however taking acetometaphin every day isn't exactly great for your liver i just don't know what he's going to be able to do for me i've tried everything claritin allegra zyrtec none of them have done anything for me it was like i took nothing and i had to take the tylenol allergy again what other pills are left wait can he prescribe the ingedients in tylenol allergy but without the tylenol part an allergist can do skin testing to see what you are allergic to the obvious answer is to stay away from the items you are allergic to like peanuts eggs milk etc but other items are not so easy to stay away from like dust mites pollen dander etc so the allergist may suggest that you get shots every week to every month to build up immunity to the allergen eventually ideally you will no longer be allergic to these items any more it can take up to years however you may develop allergies to new things in the meantime a friend told me that clarinex is times stronger than claritin maybe you can ask your allergist about this good luck  Allergy Hay fever Asthma Immunoglobulin E Food allergy House dust mite Eczema Chronic fatigue syndrome Mast cell Psoriasis Tattoo Insulin Chimera (genetics) Urticaria Coeliac disease Conjunctivitis Urinary incontinence Common cold Breastfeeding Protein Air pollution Menstrual cycle Multiple chemical sensitivity Paracetamol Toxic mold Food Cannabis (drug) Hypersensitivity Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Crohn's disease Clomipramine Scabies Quicksort Medicine Acne Basophil granulocyte Fancy rat Amiodarone Cat Sulfasalazine Stomach cancer Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Cephalexin Infectious mononucleosis Pitaten 1982 Chicago Tylenol murders Social rule Rosacea Mastocytosis Methylsulfonylmethane Arguments for and against drug prohibition Polyvinyl chloride Doxepin Sinusitis Aspergillosis Theory of conduct DNA__ Tuberculosis Nasal congestion Maprotiline Promethazine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Multiple sclerosis Kender Fecal incontinence Emphysema Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hiberno-English Tocopherol Propranolol Antihistamine Extreme Programming Rodney McKay Homeopathy Loratadine Ulcerative colitis Diseases of the honeybee Bee Dexamethasone Oh My Goddess!

what type of allergic reaction to milk is this called first off i've been allergic to milk ever since i was born i just never learned the exact type of allergic reaction i've had yet and i hear there are several the symptoms i experience very shortly after consuming any milk containing products whatsoever are pretty severe and take at least hours to subside and weaken my symptoms from drink milk are major heart pain added heart pain from each breath in my lungs foaming of the mouth a lot of foaming i have to spit it out for awhile strange feeling in my blood flow tenderness and burning in my throat the worst is definitely the heart pain though i have to sit still for awhile i breath very slowly so it doesn't hurt worse any sudden movements or breaths causes double the pain what's the reaction called nausea is another symptom half of the time it causes me to throw up when i was a kid though it was every time a lot of people don't know the difference between a dairy allergy and lactose intolerance if you were diagnosed with an allergy by a doctor then what you have is not lactose intolerance i'm lactose intolerant and what you've described sounds nothing like what i get an allergy is when your immune system mistakes something completely harmless for a dangerous invader and attacks it it's usually in response to a protein lactose intolerance on the other hand means that the digestive system does not produce enough of the enzyme that breaks down lactose which is the sugar naturally found in milk sugars and proteins are different the immune system and the digestive system are different the two conditions are totally unrelated to each other lactose intolerance can be treated easily a common way is by taking pills that contain the necessary enzyme i'm not an expert on allergy treatment but my understanding is that the best and most common treatment especially for food allergies requires avoiding the allergen lactose intolerance is the normal state of the human species not being lactose intolerant is caused by a genetic mutation that originated somewhere in europe which is why it's very common in white european people and much less common among other ethnic groups an allergy on the other hand is a malfunction caused by hypersensitivity of the immune system it is not the normal fully functioning state of the species are you sure that the pain you feel comes from your heart pain in the lower esophagus is often mistaken for heart pain which is why it's commonly referred to as heartburn even though it's actually caused by small amounts of acid from the stomach getting into the esophagus by accident i don't know much about the specific types of allergies so i'm afraid i can't answer your actual question but the constant uninformed misinformation people spread about dairy allergies and lactose intolerance annoys me so at very least i've set the record straight on that  Hay fever Psoriasis Hypoglycemia Biochemistry First aid Cheese Multiple chemical sensitivity Pneumonia Prostate cancer Aspartame Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Urinary incontinence Lac operon Vegetarianism Nutrition Atherosclerosis Cirrhosis Diabetes mellitus Soy milk Heartburn Traumatic brain injury Food Immune system Medicine Dairy Ulcerative colitis Yoghurt Conjunctivitis Stroke Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chocolate Tooth Sugar Helicobacter pylori Veganism Clomipramine Paracetamol Angioedema Decompression sickness Immunoglobulin E Guinea pig Rheumatoid arthritis Malaria Eczema Endometriosis HIV test Group A streptococcal infection Multiple sclerosis AIDS reappraisal Panic attack Anemia Cystic fibrosis Mouth ulcer Antiretroviral drug Controversies in autism Peanut Anxiety Insomnia Lactobacillus acidophilus Flatulence Raw milk Mast cell Gastroparesis Vitamin C DNA repair Charles Darwin's illness Herpes simplex virus Cocaine Cell (biology) Spider Common cold Bipolar disorder Leukemia Shock Tocopherol Drowning Glycogen storage disease type I

are any nuts if any as in salted almond walnut etc good for your heart there aren't any 'magic' foods that can automatically improve your health a good diet includes plenty of variety and nuts contain many of the vitamins and minerals that are usually missing from the 'mainstream' range of foods however the benefits of eating a good diet which will probably include nuts seeds as well as green vegetables wholefood 'staples' and a moderate amount of fat can easily be cancelled out by doing unhealthy things if you eat nuts while drinking beer in front of the tv then they are definitely not going to help your heart a 'fruitarian' diet is very healthy and contains a lot of nuts the idea is an extreme version of veganism as well as cutting out all animal products you also exclude foods that are obtained by damaging a plant only those parts of a plant which are designed to be discarded can be eaten for example grains wheat maize barley rice etc are permitted but only if they have been stripped from a plant which continues to grow afterwards rather than being cut down as it would be in western industrial agriculture surprisingly it is possible to get sufficient nutrition from these foodstuffs alone however the most healthy part of the diet might be the amount of effort that you need to put into obtaining the right products  Vegetarian nutrition Hamster Fruitarianism Nutrition Bread Cereal Agriculture Soybean Omega-3 fatty acid Rice Healthy eating Green Revolution Peanut Milk Tocopherol Food guide pyramid Genetically modified food Dieting Maize Organic farming Tofu Atkins Nutritional Approach Folic acid Quinoa Potato Paleolithic diet Coeliac disease Food preservation Coronary heart disease Dietary fiber Jewish cuisine Barley Ramen Fruit Alcoholic beverage Fancy rat Chicken Chocolate Vitamin C Acorn Cuisine of Africa Golden rice Antioxidant Cuisine of Denmark Neolithic Revolution Kosher foods Alcohol fuel Miso Egg (food) Peruvian cuisine Margarine Beer Nut (fruit) Cheerios Genetic engineering Flour Economy of Colombia Domestic rabbit Oat Famine Cuisine of Malaysia Kashrut Sugar MyPyramid Common bean Cuisine of Brazil Soul food Flowering plant Breastfeeding South Beach diet Hypoglycemia Vitamin Low-carbohydrate diet Sorghum Hemp Zinc Passover Stomach cancer Vegetarian cuisine Botany Brewery Economy of the People's Republic of China Guinea pig Watermelon Cheese Global warming and agriculture Plant Obesity Trans fat
