what r b song is this the lyrics i remember are she told me her name and i politely did the same verse see we both shared a crowded room not formally introduced but i've been watching her watching me all night and then she disappeared for a few must have got herself a drink or two to work up a nerve to come and say hi she politely spoke her name like a gentleman i did the same and she sat down and we talked for a moment yeah she told me she'd be pleased to be the lucky lady living with me that sounds nice but i'd hate to hurt my woman chorus so what so what it's all love it's all love show love that's what she said to me yeah it's alright it's alright goodbye goodbye but for now you gotta live for the moment verse now what i look like deceiving my lady the future mother of my babies and lose a love that took years to build to do that i must be crazy and right now i don't feel crazy even though you're killing me with your sex appeal and on the real she may never know but the problem is i'll know but how can i look into my baby's eyes now it just might be cool for some but i refuse to be the one to let a moment ruin my life chorus bridge i must admit you look remarkable but my woman puts you to shame cause what we have is more than physical yeah more like spiritual souls intertwining intertwining like a braid chorus solong lyrics artist band musiq soulchild  Jon Secada Cliff Richard Louie, Louie The Ashlee Simpson Show She Loves You Blonde on Blonde Aerosmith The Emancipation of Mimi Blood on the Tracks The Wall Shaggy dog story Avenue Q The Shining (film) The Isley Brothers Little Britain Slow Train Coming The Yeomen of the Guard Hip hop rivalries Max Martin Can't Hardly Wait Roxette Rod Stewart Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Strokes The Marshall Mathers LP Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) Infidels Social rule Marilyn Monroe Sin City The Amber Spyglass The Beach Boys Jennifer Lopez Stevie Wonder The Catcher in the Rye Porgy and Bess The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Parsifal Bohemian Rhapsody Humphrey Bogart The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Charly Garc__a Fiddler on the Roof The Curse of Fenric Treehouse of Horror V Unreleased Madonna songs EastEnders Miss Saigon Bringing It All Back Home Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.
