is there any program that can recover deleted items in my pc i want to retrieve a document file deleted last month there are several but what you're asking to do may be a tough order first make sure it's not in your recycle bin if there then just click on it and select restore if it's not there the chances of being able to recover it are low because when a file is deleted only the name is removed from a table of all files on the system when it's removed from that table the system can then reuse the space on the disk where that file used to reside if it does then you file cannot usually be recovered you can search the net for undelete software there are several and some even have free trials that let you see what files it can undelete  Virtual memory File system NTFS Linked list Data remanence Macintosh Finder Btrieve Malware Mouse (computing) Shred Spyware Macromedia Flash Freenet SQL Web crawler Dustbin Recycling CPU cache Backup Windows XP Library (computer science) File Allocation Table ITunes Hard disk Files-11 Atari DOS Linux USB flash drive Forth programming language Berkeley Software Distribution Disk formatting Java programming language Database Enterprise content management Microsoft Jet Database Engine MDAC Password JavaScript Norton Utilities Cache Screenshot Plaintext Page table Kazaa Windows 2000 Translation memory GNOME Disk image Unicode Windows Vista Waste management System 7 (Macintosh) Portable Document Format ISO image Gmail Blue screen of death Pretty Good Privacy AmigaOS Computer security NTFS junction point OpenDocument Master Control Program Common Unix Printing System Microsoft Windows File format Windows API Stardock WordPerfect Filename extension Emacs C programming language SonicStage Journaling file system Embedded system Disk cloning Wiki Mac OS X Symbolic link HyperCard Mozilla Firefox ALGOL 68 Anti-virus software Fossil (file system) Netfilter/iptables Data recovery Metadata WordStar ZIP (file format) Trusted computing Host file Defragmentation Redundant array of independent disks IPod Partition (computing) Microsoft GNU Ultima Online Computer file

damn small linux my old computer is running xp but barely has enough ram to run xp so i'm thinking about installing damn small linux on it i'm wondering how great of an os is damn small linux and can it run all the same applications as other linux operating systems such as wine damn small linux is okay for basic tasks like surfing the internet typing documents or playing simple games it comes with firefox but a much older version if i recall i don't believe i can check that it comes with wine or even has it available as a download through mydsl you could download the source code and possibly compile it yourself but if you are not comfortable with the command line then this might not be a good idea damn small linux was designed for really old computers even to run on a if your computer is higher than mb of ram then using damn small linux might be overkill you may be interested in puppylinux http www puppylinux com it has far more recent versions of popular programs it uses seamonkey instead of firefox but there is little difference between them i do not think puppy comes with wine but i'm almost sure that someone has developed a pup package for it puppylinux requires mb of ram it is a little awkward to install to a hard drive so you will have to look up the instructions and follow them very carefully  Windows Server 2003 Windows XP Computer virus Windows 2000 Virtual memory Puppy Linux Windows NT Dynamic random access memory Dodge Charger Pocket PC Windows 95 IBM PC compatible X Window System Acorn Electron IPAQ Windows 1.0 Microsoft Windows Windows 98 History of Microsoft Windows Random access memory Linux DOS Pentium 4 Server Apple II family Personal computer Windows 3.x Emacs Ramesses II Transmission Control Protocol Text editor System 7 (Macintosh) Embedded system Windows Mobile Sequent Computer Systems Jet engine AmigaOS Windows Vista Cygwin International Phonetic Alphabet NeXT Tintin and Alph-Art MOS Technology 6502 Skype Mac OS X Timeline of computing 1990-forward 64-bit Page table Automobile RISC Emulator Windows Me Terminate and Stay Resident Sinclair ZX81 Sega Saturn Windows XP Professional x64 Edition MP3 WordPerfect OS/2 Dell Axim Commodore 64 CPU design Visual Basic .NET Windows XP Media Center Edition Redundant array of independent disks Windows CE SETI@home Windows 2.0 History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Minimo X86 WordStar Windows Installer Wintel New Morning A600 PaX Upper Memory Area DVD-RAM Adobe Acrobat IBM PC St. Louis Rams Xbox Apple Macintosh CPU cache Computer software Microsoft Office System 6 Library (computer science) The Sims 2 2004 World Series RAM disk Kernel (computer science) Spring operating system Taikyoku shogi Xbox 360 RAM Racing Color Graphics Adapter Device driver

an os selector program that works with vista i use to use acronis os selector but that is not compatable with vista know any os selector programs that works with vista if you are planning to dual boot with xp or another version of windows then what you can do is install windows xp onto a partition then install windows vista onto another partition and windows vista will install it's own boot loader that will dual boot with xp if you are wanting to dual boot with linux then use a modern distribution such as ubuntu feisty fawn and it will install itself with a boot loader that will let you boot between ubuntu and vista i hope this helps  Free software Free Software Foundation Unicode Shareware Warez GNU Free Documentation License GNU General Public License Kazaa Version Open-source software United States v.

why is my vlc player acting funny please help whenever i play a dvd using vlc the movie always acts a bit funny it would play and everything but it's like 'lagging' it's constantly pausing very briefly then continues it's driving me nuts the odd thing is when i first downloaded vlc and put in a dvd it worked perfectly without any problems but that was just one time i deleted the program then reinstalled it but it's still doing it what could be wrong i am not sure of the answer however i can tell you that vlc uses its own codecs decoders that are built into the program rather than the codecs that you might have installed on your system while vlc is a great easy to use program that plays lots of different formats sometimes it can have trouble handling some of the newer file formats i would advise you to download and install the newest version of vlc in hopes that it plays your file in a smoother manner make sure your system isn't too busy doing background tasks if you are doing a lot of disk access the video may freeze momentarily when vlc tries to fetch data from the disk cache example i was having trouble playing flash videos in flv format but updating my vlc to the newest version did the trick now they play perfectly and i didn't need to install the flash decoder on my system  Jon Lech Johansen DVD player Theora Warez FairPlay Vorbis Ragnarok Online Comparison of media players DVD MP3 Digital rights management Grand Theft Auto 2 Game Boy Advance FFmpeg Dave Matthews Band ITunes H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Xbox Live Ware MPEG-4 Part 3 Blackjack Nullsoft Streaming Video Asterisk Chess Scrabble Xenosaga WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Party Game$ Regional lockout Chris Ware SUSE Linux RealPlayer Windows XP Marilyn Waring Minesweeper (computer game) Volleyball Zones of EverQuest WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$ Digital audio player Z__oty Snooker Metallica Karaoke Unreal Tournament 2004 Chess opening IPod Romansh language Mario Kart DS Xbox ITunes Music Store Violin Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Porcelain Web crawler Darts Copy protection Anamorphic widescreen Podcasting Tag Chinese export porcelain Japanese pottery Matmos Pornography Harvey Award String Cheese Incident Jets'n'Guns Capture the flag Counter-Strike Slot machine Bass guitar Halo 2 Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Eric Prydz Big band Ultima Online Half-Life 2 Softball High-definition television Wipeout (game) Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield Bj__rk Radio drama Xbox Media Center Unreal series Attack of the Show!

how do i know that im lagging im playing an online fps game and my ping is usually around but the other players kept on complaining that im lagging when im playing i see other players running stationary then they suddenly disappear and appear somewhere else like teleport or something also there are players whom i shot a million times but won't die then they suddenly disappear and then appear behind me im dead by then what are the signs that im lagging what are the signs that they're lagging my pc specs amd dual core ghz gb ddr ram gb of free space on hard drive two mb nvidia geforce gt not in sli kbps internet connection but im subscribed for mbps my cpu temp is around degrees i've checked for virus trojans spyware etc none found defragmented and disk cleanup when playing i don't have any programs running in the background that would affect the game everything is set to low in the game any help is appreciated david the ping isn't displayed during gameplay so im not sure if its around but im assuming that it doesn't exceed i also end most programs using the windows task manager so my pf usage no idea what that is is around mb about my startup only a few are on the startup list whalemeister about the sli thing when im playing the game and my video card is in sli the computer freezes no idea why the sli thing works fine with other games but not in the game warrock i usually play av and firewalls are off before i start the game this game servers is hosted in our country about the ping i can't ask them what my ping is cause its not displayed during gameplay about the bandwidth the max our isp provides is mpbs can't afford it im still a student and too scared to ask my parents they might find out i play too much video games whalemeister another thing am i the one lagging when i see lots of player disappearing then appearing firstly get those cards sli'd up the symptoms you describe sound like classic lag symptoms to me i see other players running stationary then they suddenly disappear and appear somewhere else like teleport or something also there are players whom i shot a million times but won't die then they suddenly disappear and then appear behind me im dead by then all of that are signs of lag when you say i don't have any programs running in the background that would affect the game does that include anti virus software and firewalls both av software and firewall settings can eat into your bandwidth other than that i would recommend upgrading your internet connection to a faster line i'm at mbps and have no issues with lag modern multiplayer gaming does use quite a bit of bandwidth your hardware will probably not be causing your issues here your graphics cards are a little on the old side now but as long as you can play the game fine in single player without really low framerates it won't cause an issue in multiplayer quite often the ping you see is quite a bit lower than your actual ping ask someone else online what your ping is you'll probably get a few 'funny' responses but most people will tell you what ping they see for you if upgrading your internet connection is not an option if you want to play online you should seriously think about it you can try to only play on servers hosted in your country as generally you'll get better ping times hope this helps and happy gaming  Interactive geometry

why do some linux users have so much attitude ghettocyrano you are right on the money with this one my friend most users of linux are what the world would consider nerds or geeks they have better knowledge than most of technical issues but no real social skills so when they are in a situation of perceived power such as knowledge that most others don't have they tend to act superior unfortunately this syndrome occurs with power users in general this is why most it personnel get such a bad rap they have no patience with those who don't understand computers on their level and those who do are perceived as a threat  Inflation Personal finance Compiler optimization Hyperinflation Quicksort Circuit design FairTax Social Security (United States) Corporate finance Wheel of Fortune Resistor Spreadsheet Ra (board game) Mutual fund RuneScape Bond Microeconomics Digital photography Gramophone record Life insurance Grade (education) Unix time Solar variation Annuity Money supply Monetary policy Digital-to-analog converter PID controller Credit card Deflation (economics) Connecticut Scuba set Wind power Exponential growth Yield curve Treasury security Central processing unit U.S. generally accepted accounting principles Equine conformation Gross domestic product Analog-to-digital converter Lotus 1-2-3 Betting (poker) 401(k) Supply and demand $ale of the Century Wal-Mart Deficit spending Present value Continued fraction Ashton-Tate Year 2000 problem ELO rating system Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Taxation in the United States Control flow Mixtape Kitesurfing Gas metal arc welding Insurance Decibel Fuel injection Press Your Luck Economy of the Philippines Divorce Tax Education in the People's Republic of China National Football League Inkscape Debt U.S. public debt The Origin of Species Diving regulator Unemployment Aberration in optical systems On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Linked list Operational amplifier Carbon dioxide Sea level rise Labour economics Welding Tri-Stat dX Mattress Entropy Economy of C__te d'Ivoire Keynesian economics Eyepiece Corporate governance PNG Monopoly (game) MOSFET Gaia theory (science) Blood pressure Acquire Batting average Lincoln-Douglas Debate

can i install word on my laptop i have recently gotten a new laptop with windows vista it came with a trial version of word i already have a desktop with word which i have paid for and have the activation key i do not want to pay for word yet i don't have the money for it can i install word on the laptop with vista without having to uninstall word it depends on what version of microsoft office you have of course word is usually packaged with microsoft office but there are different office packages that are offered office student and home editions each allow installation on up to computers office professional and ultimate allow installation on only one computer first check to make sure you haven't reach the maximum number of installations for whatever version you have unfortunately even with a spare use for your software i don't believe that you can have two different versions of microsoft word on your laptop if you install word your cd will recognize that word is already on your computer and will ask you to either go with the trial version or remove it and install word i'd recommend using the trial version until you are finished with all of its uses and then install word don't worry if you don't have the money to buy word just yet the layout between the two may look vastly different but most of the features are exactly the same  Warez World Wide Web BitTorrent Mozilla Firefox Kazaa Web crawler Microsoft Spyware Podcasting Software agent Apple Computer Website Uniform Resource Locator Windows XP HyperCard Sega Dreamcast Charles Ives Macromedia Flash Linux Gnutella Computer virus Domain Name System Jon Lech Johansen Copyleft ITunes Screenshot Apache HTTP Server Software patent Free software File sharing Patent Patch (computing) Wiki Wireless Application Protocol IPod Atari ST Digital rights management H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Internet Mozilla Application Suite Proxy server Freenet Mac OS X v10.4 Representational State Transfer Software engineering Unix Common Unix Printing System Linux distribution Mac OS X Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Firewall (networking) Open access Computational fluid dynamics IBM PC compatible Xbox Numerical analysis Web server Digital audio workstation Computer science Opera (web browser) Session Initiation Protocol Ebook Windows registry Source code Public domain Open-source software Genetic algorithm DVD Windows Vista ILife Filename extension Ajax (programming) Xbox 360 Programming tool KDE SETI@home Adware Comparison of media players Web design MP3 Database management system Amazon.com Service-oriented architecture CPAN Online casino Freeware America Online Commodore 64 Adobe Acrobat Apple II family Online DVD rental Software bloat OpenBSD SUSE Linux Programming language Machinima Computer program Disk image Software cracking

how do u get pictures and music on windows movie maker under file look for the option called import into collections windows movie maker should then allow you to choose either a video audio or picture file from your computer's hard drive into your collections folder if you don't see your collections folder click on the collections tab that's right next to the tasks tab below the top menu bar since movie maker is a windows program your choice of audio files is somewhat limited as far as i know you can only import wma wav and mp audio into movie maker and it will definitely not let you import any ra realplayer or aac apple or any lesser known types of files there's no major limit on the types of picture files you can import unlike creating a new folder with every video you import windows movie maker places the pictures and audio files you import into whatever collection folder is highlighted at the time if you're working on a project that uses a lot of music and pictures my advice is to create additional folders to organize them to create a new folder either click on the new collection folder tab near the top or go to tools new collection folder hope this helps  Computer and video games Warez Independent film Apache HTTP Server HyperText Transfer Protocol Machinima BitTorrent ASCII art Windows Movie Maker Music video The Internet Movie Database Thumbnail gallery post Windows Media Video Wget Windows Mobile VJ Spyware HTTP cookie Filename extension Windows Vista Macromedia Flash Prank flash Streaming media Common Unix Printing System Slash (punctuation) Film director IBM PC compatible Web server Session Initiation Protocol Web page Artisan Entertainment Halloween (film) Soundtrack Film High-definition television Domain Name System Emmy Award Uniform Resource Locator HTML Chip's Challenge Nullsoft Streaming Video Subterranean Homesick Blues Website QuickTime Cadillac Eldorado Apple Computer Rush (band) Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events Mozilla Firefox Jennifer Lopez Screenshot Rear Window World Wide Web Bish__jo game PlayStation Portable Mydoom The Rocky Horror Picture Show Timeline of computing 1990-forward REALbasic ITunes Internet Information Services Full motion video Port numbers TRS-80 RealNetworks Video game console Microsoft Windows Digital cinematography FFmpeg Koyaanisqatsi Internet Uwe Boll Johnny Depp McFly Lefkada Wireless Application Protocol Welcome to Pia Carrot White House Madden NFL Horror film Multimedia Messaging System Kalavryta Microsoft Corpse Killer Windows XP Bartolomeo Cristofori Apple II family Proxy server Depeche Mode MTV Europe Music Awards Slashdot subculture Nude celebrities on the Internet Otakon Dictionary OS-tan

why has my computer stopped letting me burn cds hey first off this is my grandfathers computer so i'm not sure what exactly he's done but from what i gather he didn't do anything that should cause this probelm of course i'm not sure but heres the problem when ever he attempts to burn a cd using any program it won't work wmp says that the files may not fit even if you only have one song on the cd if you try to burn it anyways i get an error and that error says something like format is not supported even thought its an mp when using nero is says something about its not supported and that i may made a plug in i'm not sure what to do i've done a system restore and it hasn't fixed the problem does anyone have any suggestions if not should i attempt to just wipe out the untire computer and try to just reunistall windows and everything is doing that easy could someone with little computer knowledge do that my thinking is that windows will do mostly everything thanks for the help the first thing i would try is to put a blank cd in the player have no other programs running you should get a message like what do you want to do click make a folder to burn if you do not get the message go to my computer and click on the e drive or what ever your computer says is the drive of the cd then find the music an put it in the burn folder if the computer will do it then you know the problem is with media player and nero not with the computer if the computer will not do it then go to control panel system hardware device manager see if there is a yellow warning that the device is not working you didn't mention which version of windows you have some cd players on older machines will only do certain types of cd's make sure you are using a compatible type  Computer virus Microsoft Office E-mail Mozilla Firefox Mac OS X Internet Explorer Gmail Mozilla Thunderbird Windows XP Dialer Microsoft Outlook Microsoft Windows WordPerfect Stopping e-mail abuse Mozilla Application Suite Opera (web browser) System 7 (Macintosh) Windows Vista OpenOffice.org E-mail spam Microsoft .NET BitTorrent Linux Microsoft Internet Message Access Protocol MDAC Verizon Wireless KDE Webmail Spyware Steam (content delivery) Pretty Good Privacy Post Office Protocol Kazaa Common criticisms of Microsoft Wine (software) Outlook Express Proxy server Danger Hiptop Ajax (programming) Patch (computing) OpenDocument Blue screen of death Perl Windows 2000 IPod Podcasting Application software Trillian (instant messenger) Windows Me AmigaOS Hotmail Windows Installer Apple Macintosh Digital photography Google Windows Mobile Sender Policy Framework Anonymous remailer Melissa worm Browser wars History of Microsoft Windows OpenBSD Linspire Rootkit ITunes PHP IBM PC compatible Netscape Navigator Emacs GNOME SCO-Linux controversies Computer forensics DR-DOS Mydoom Linux distribution Internet fraud Mandriva Linux CPAN Ubuntu Linux Computer software Object Desktop Forth programming language Windows Server 2003 Btrieve Xbox Web crawler Domain Name System MSN HTML DLL hell Mac OS X v10.2 Mac OS X v10.4 64-bit Microsoft Word PLATO Spotlight (software) REBOL NX bit Surveillance

please help me with my vista before i lose it i'm just going to suck it up and try to get used to vista there are some things bothering me though that if fixed would make me much happier i was using xp in the past which i love and miss and when working with files folders there was always that handy box to the left with the options move rename copy delete etc it isn't there with vista is there a way to get it if not how can you easily move several files into a folder for example i'm trying to organize my picture folder into several subfolders and the help only said drag and drop but that is only good for one file please help also is there a good site with simple helpful vista info help windows vista is different to say the least microsoft wants to create a program that is childproof so it changes how people can move and delete things meaning the software will work seamlessly so they think if you want to control any program like the good old days you have to right click on the program and select run as administrator then windows will verify with you if it's safe to continue feel free to do what ever after that good luck  Windows XP Windows 2000 Windows Vista AmigaOS Macintosh Finder IPod IBM PC compatible Musical Instrument Digital Interface Object Desktop Computer virus System/36 Windows 3.x C programming language Common Unix Printing System ITunes History of Microsoft Windows File Allocation Table File system System 7 (Macintosh) Windows Me Blue screen of death Debugging Screenshot History of the graphical user interface Microsoft Windows Mouse (computing) USB flash drive Disk image Computer Mach kernel Windows Media Player Floppy disk Apple II family X Window System Architecture of Windows 2000 Atari 8-bit family Commodore 64 SonicStage System 6 Apple Macintosh Copy protection Stardock Embedded system Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Java programming language Digital rights management Windows registry Hello world program Virtual memory Gmail System/34 DOS MS-DOS Atari ST Personal computer Burroughs B5000 Mac OS LiveCD IBM PC Objective-C Windows 1.0 Macromedia Flash Microsoft Ethernet Vorbis Windows Mobile Unicode Bluetooth Universal Serial Bus PlayStation 2 Plan 9 (operating system) Xerox Star Device driver Kernel (computer science) Library (computer science) Windows Server 2003 Control Panel (Windows) Konqueror Compact disc Pretty Good Privacy Backup FreeDOS Spring operating system Digital audio player Windows API PowerPC Jumpstart 3rd Grade ZX Spectrum Palm OS Cascading Style Sheets

is mac os x leopard worth waiting for points for all questions answered its july rightt now and that ipod free offer is going around however i don't really care about that i just want to know if mac leopard os x will it be as smooth as tiger and not as earthshattering horrible when windows vista came out should i wait for leopard to come out or go with tiger this is my first time getting a mac and i am just wondering also throughout the history of mac's from different osx to tiger was it stable when it came out for ex was tiger stable when it first came out thanks in advance tiger did have some quirks when it first came out but nothing horrible as far as i remember and they were smoothed out in due time there will be several prominent new features in leopard when it comes out but personally few of them really struck me as amazing having an automated and easily navigable backup system like time machine will be nice but i won't die without spaces or the new d reflective dock right now tiger is a perfectly mature operating system and will serve you well take a look at the list of leopard's new features linked below and compare them with a current mac if you can play around with one in a store the upgrade will cost you if you buy it separately from the mac so if you feel this isn't such a big expenditure you can buy leopard after it's had a few updates cranked out for it in fact the only reason leopard isn't already out is because they're still ironing out bugs leopard will open up some exciting possibilities for mac developers they'll be able to make programs that do things that would've been difficult to code before but for a normal user like yourself tiger will more than likely suit your needs hope this helps  BitTorrent File sharing Peer-to-peer Internet Explorer Internet Warez Opera (web browser) Mozilla Firefox EMule General Packet Radio Service Netscape Navigator Web browser Web hosting Spyware Bulletin board system Web design Extreme Programming File Transfer Protocol Ajax (programming) World Wide Web Mozilla Application Suite Mouse (computing) Online shop Browser wars Web 2.0 Netscape Communications Corporation Windows XP Azureus PlayStation Portable XML Cascading Style Sheets Common criticisms of Microsoft Web page Uploading and downloading Timeline of computing 1990-forward Modem Internet pornography MySpace Computer virus Domain Name System Password MSN Messenger Social software GIF Mandriva Linux IPod LimeWire NeXT Pop-up ad Python programming language The Internet Movie Database Web application Enterprise content management Internet forum Sun Microsystems Voice over IP Web crawler Commodore 64 Gnutella Kazaa Debian Flickr Distributed computing Website Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Phishing History of Microsoft Windows Proxy server Unicode MAME Comparison of web browsers Internet Explorer for Mac Knoppix Sega Dreamcast Greasemonkey Mozilla Server MMORPG Open source culture Broadband Internet access Cross site scripting HTML element Stopping e-mail abuse Danger Hiptop Java programming language Make money fast DeltaAnime Digital rights management Trusted computing Copyright KDE Uniform Resource Locator Blogger Debugging Outlook Express PNG Thread (computer science) Linux distribution Cable television

why cant i open this folder i have a folder on my computer which has movie clips if i try to open up the folder the windows explorer not responding message comes up or it just closes if i try to open it using a different program or anything as soon as i enter the folder the program shuts down why is this happening and how can i fix it how do i go into dos mode and it has gb of free space well movie clips takes up a lot of memory as is so when you go to open it up it takes that much more memory plus cpu and ram so if you have programs running when you try to open the folder close them another and the best thing you need to do is to first delete the folder then re download the files but instead of having them in the same folder create multiple folders to categorize them i e action comedy suspense etc and create sub folders to them to balance the data in each folder finally after you have created and filled all of your folders put them all in a folder called movie clips to save space on the desktop at start up note don't open the files with the internet explorer program even it's a clip from the internet if it is make sure you are connected to the internet and open them with realplayer or windows media player even if it isn't a clip from the internet do the same thing except you don't have to be connected to the internet  Windows Vista Portable Document Format Photography Perl Hello world program Mouse (computing) Ebook Common Unix Printing System AppleScript AmigaOS Macromedia Flash Bookbinding Xerox Star Screenshot HTML element BASIC programming language WYSIWYG Cascading Style Sheets WordPerfect Unicode Windows 2000 Xerox OpenDocument Printing press Gmail International Phonetic Alphabet Mac OS X v10.4 File format System 7 (Macintosh) Apple typography Minesweeper (computer game) Killian documents Mozilla Firefox Digital photography XML Windows XP Esperanto orthography Emacs Enterprise content management Computer printer Java programming language SAS System PHP Open access Mac OS X Object-oriented programming Web page Morse Code Opera (web browser) Google TOPS-20 Stereoscopy XHTML Konica Minolta Forth programming language Japanese tea ceremony Inkjet printer Favicon Icon (computing) Document management system Search engine optimization C plus plus LaTeX Antenna (radio) Photocopying P__li Computer virus Google Desktop Mozilla Application Suite Map Double-click (computing) Fractal Internet Relay Chat System 6 Oxford English Dictionary Movie projector Apple Macintosh System/36 Rigging OpenOffice.org Paper IBM PC keyboard Downing Street memo Legal research Start Menu Object Desktop WordStar Flat file database History of the graphical user interface Palm OS Jumpstart 3rd Grade El Lissitzky Webster's Dictionary Book Wikipedia View camera NaturallySpeaking Embedded system Human Genome Project PostScript

can windows vista be installed on a dell dimension my sister in law has a problem with her dimension i think its a dell she cannot do a system resore cannot do a defrag cant use her original system restore disks to return it to factory default because it tells her that whats on the disks is older than what she has on her pc now and cannot figure out what is wrong with it she thought about installing windows vista in hopes that it would solve her problems she cannot download any files and cannot install any software she also cannot restore the pc to an earlie date i think she has deleted some important files and it messed her pc up can vista be installed on a dell dimension and if so what would it take to do so also can anyone clue me into what may be wrong with her pc so i can help her fix it she is currently running windows xp and the computer is about three years old first of all this whole problem sounds like it is related to her being out of disk space try to free up some space on the machine and it should resolve these issues the biggest hint is not being able to download programs or to defrag both would happen if space was low to answer the rest of your questions according to the minimum requirements for vista and the specs on that machine you might be able to http www microsoft com windows products windowsvista editions systemrequirements mspx however the system you refer to is older and i would imagine the experience would be slow at best and drive space may be low i recommend that you try the upgrade advisor here to gain greater insight if you wish to run vista though i think you're looking at the problem from the wrong angle and should consider freeing space on the machine and checking disk integrity http www microsoft com windows products windowsvista buyorupgrade upgradeadvisor mspx wt svl a mg id b  Windows XP Computer virus Microsoft Windows Spyware NX bit RISC CPU cache Rootkit Central processing unit Windows 2000 Linux Windows Server 2003 Virtual memory 64-bit Zone Labs Windows 3.x Windows API Buffer overflow Random access memory MIPS architecture IBM PC compatible PowerPC Personal computer Original Amiga chipset Computer Stopping e-mail abuse Operating system Microsoft AntiSpyware Embedded system Windows Vista Internet security Emulator CPU design Thread (computer science) ZX Spectrum INMOS Transputer NeXT Skype Computer multitasking IBM PC History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Booting History of Microsoft Windows Computer security PaX Emacs Timeline of computing 1990-forward Microsoft Apple Computer Sinclair ZX81 Personal firewall Host file Filename extension X86 CDC 6600 Spring operating system OpenOffice.org Apple Macintosh X Window System Control-Alt-Delete Mac OS history IA-64 Intel iAPX 432 Perl Read-only memory USB flash drive Mach kernel Super Nintendo Entertainment System Forth programming language Kernel (computer science) Carbon (API) Pocket PC MDAC Visual Basic Symantec SAS System Distributed computing Game programming Firewall (networking) Library (computer science) OS/2 Real-time operating system Microprocessor Btrieve History of operating systems Computer software Mac OS X Nintendo Entertainment System Microprogram AS/400 Upper Memory Area Grid computing File system Konfabulator Computer cluster Mandriva Linux Motorola 68000 Server

how do you install an os on a blank hdd hi i have a crappy old dell box p mb ram gb hdd a macbook pro previously i had windows ' on the dell but i wanted to try something different so downloaded xubuntu i can copy that to the hdd or a blank cd to put in the dell but when i do that if i start it up it just says no operating system found on the screen it repeats that every time i press a key i copied the hard drive of the dell to my mbp before wiping it too but now that i restore the dells hdd to its' original way it still says no os found when i put it back in i'm using an external firewire enclosure w my mbp so can anyone tell me how can i get wins ' or xubuntu onto this thing i also have the original not pirated install disks for wins me but not the rego key i've tried about other rego keys which haven't worked after installing wins me thanks i think your main problem is that the cd drive is not the first boot device you need to go into the bios and change the boot order sothat the cd is first copying the files of a os system wont work as there are other bits that don't appear n the os file system to check your xubuntu cd is correct put it in the mac and check that there are a lot of files if there is only one with a filename that ends in ' iso' then you will need to rewrite the cd with burning software that writes the iso file as an image you may be able to reinstall win but you will need an original cd email me if you need further info  Warez Web server Spyware Apache HTTP Server Free software Digital photography ITunes Maya (software) Web browser Web application Ajax (programming) Macromedia Flash MySQL Copy protection Digital rights management ZX Spectrum Computer animation Eddie Murphy Amstrad CPC Software cracking Web hosting Uniform Resource Locator Movie theater Common Unix Printing System CPAN PHP Stardock Walter Grauman Brainfuck Patch (computing) Screensaver Digital watermarking MSN Messenger LAMP (software bundle) Knoppix Electronic commerce Windows XP IMac GIF Software engineering Dubbing (filmmaking) Screen Gems Sega Machinima ILife Computer software IMAX Proxy server Borland Jennifer Lopez Subtitle PHP-Nuke IBM PC compatible Commodore 64 Video game controversy America Online WIN Television Claris Stopping e-mail abuse Microsoft Windows ICalendar HTTP cookie Screenwriting Enterprise content management Modding Captcha Streaming media Multimedia Messaging System IPod Nintendo DS GoldenEye 007 Microsoft First-sale doctrine Subscription business model Python programming language Yohoho!

installing windows service pack ive read some questions similar to mine and all of the answers to them we're complete garbage halfway though the instilation of service pack i get a error that says 'access is denied i get it though windows automatic updates im the only user on the computer so im the computer admin i have a genuine copy of windows i know this for a fact i went on the microsoft website and read this article http support microsoft com kb top but im lost at step dont answer if you have no idea what your talking about i get stuck at step subsection a i do everything in step section a then i get stuck at the last sentence after you enable verbose logging install windows xp sp or windows server sp again to capture the registry key i tried ignoring this and going straight to step section e but i cant find error access is denied anywhere in the file i'm not sure what gets you stuck getting the log file or finding the error in the log file or fixing the registry key that is indicated as causing the error you need to be more specific as step is multi step if you are stuck on fixing it you need to run regedit from the command line and delete the key be sure to export the key and backup your registry first in case it screws up the computer then try repeating if that doesn't work there are some registry repair tools out there i think power toys for winxp might have a repair registry option it is free dl from ms otherwise norton utilities' win doctor might help it might also help to download all of sp like an admin on a network would there is info on ms website if you look hard enough and that might help your install go faster good luck i'll try to check back if you add more details and see if i can help more edit after enabling the verbose logging you can't skip the rest the reason you can't find the log entry is because you tried installing before verbose logging was enabled so you basically got a shortened version of the log enable the logging try installing sp then when you get the error that will be logged then you should be able to go into the log file and find out what key was bad the rest should make sense from there  Hard disk Uploading and downloading The Right Stuff Computer and video games IBM PC Linux Quantum computer Warez Internet Modem Windows XP Steam (content delivery) Dave Matthews Band VAIO Video game music Chess Melissa worm Computer science File sharing HAL 9000 Forth programming language Digital audio player Digital photography Stuff (magazine) Wireless Application Protocol Genetic algorithm Object Desktop Computational complexity theory Vanessa Lynn Williams Web crawler Spyware ZX Spectrum W.

what is linux im trying to get windows xp and alot of people are saying just get linux what is it and how is compared to xp as far running other programs and soft ware and stuff like that linux is an open source operating system that is very much like unix installing and running the raw downloaded linux is not for the novice or even for many experienced unix folks there are many packaged supported versions called distros available in the market many of them available for free for personal use linux is better than windows in that it is broadly immune from viruses and other maladies that windows suffers from by the same token it does not have the breadth of applications that windows enjoys for most day to day applications there are linux equivalents for instance there is openoffice that works very much like ms office and can read write in ms office format linux has a windows emulator called wine that runs a lot of windows apps though not as fast since it is an emulator and has to go thru an additional layer look up opensuse and freespire  Unicorn PlayStation Portable American Dragon: Jake Long Simone Weil The Last Unicorn Babylon 5 Prayer DVD Tenchi Muyo!

questions about outlook express a program that i use for my job integrates with full versions of outlook or higher most of what i'm trying to do with it has to do with the calendar but the program accesses those calanders through different email addresses the default email account is used to send email to other addresses that will be set up on the same pc i have outlook express but i can't find the calendar does this mean it's not a full version if not how can i get the full version can i set up two separate calanders through two separate email accounts using outlook on the same account of the same computer how does outlook on the pocket pc sync with outlook on the computer do you have to do anything besides just put the pocket pc in the cradle and let it syncronize the files if i have more than one calendar set up in outlook is there a way to make it so only one of them is sent to the pocket pc it can't be the calender of the default email address in outlook on the computer outlook express does not have a calendar outlook express is very different from outlook the full version normally you would have two users and when they log in each would be able to set up a calendar in outlook if you want to have two calendars for one user then the following should work although i have not personally used it on the tools menu click options and then click calendar options under advanced options select the enable alternate calendar check box in the list select the language you want in the second list click the calendar option you want note to quit displaying dual calendars clear the enable alternate calendar check box hope this helps  BitTorrent Peer-to-peer Blue screen of death Gnutella Hybrid vehicle Opera (web browser) Kademlia Online music store Steam (content delivery) Sigur R__s Uploading and downloading The Shining (film) Indianapolis 500 Melissa worm ITunes Music Store Kazaa Copy protection Azureus Los Alamos National Laboratory File sharing Computer and video games MAME Friends Cheating in Counter-Strike Iditarod Day of Defeat Commodore International Spread Firefox Ronin Warriors Warez 2003 North America blackout Windows XP Booting Knoppix Single certification FastTrack Apple Computer Mandriva Linux Star Wreck Napster Apollo 6 Press Your Luck Newsgroup Chess Abandonware The Star Wars Holiday Special EDonkey2000 Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Pok__mon Abilities Toyota Prius Blaster worm Crash (computing) Laptop Embedded system Battle of Calabria Fear Before The March Of Flames STS-71 Internet Canal lock Justin Frankel Grateful Dead Interactive fiction Download manager Linux Computer program San Francisco 49ers Linux distribution Atomic Kitten HAL 9000 Podcasting Macintosh Finder Chris Benoit Futurama (TV series - season 3) The Hitch-Hiker (The Twilight Zone) St. Louis Cardinals New York Giants Exception handling Blizzard Entertainment Activision Microsoft Windows Martial art Rootkit Console emulator ICQ TotalGaming.net Prince of Persia Commodore 64 The Art of Computer Programming Marathon (computer game) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Cyprus dispute Big Ben Hash tree Logo programming language Billboard Hot 100 Grokster Videotex Semicolon Suprnova.org File-sharing program

cant get drums playing off my midi keyboard in reason i can play other instruments but not the redrum redrum is kind of weird when using a midi keyboard because as it only has ten sounds loaded at one time it doesn't use the full key range i'm a little rust with reason but i believe that the redrum key range begins on c and extends chromatically up to a i may be wrong about the key range so just experiment play every key on your keyboard and if you have a small keyboard try transposing to different key ranges i hope this helps  Windows XP Virtual Network Computing Remote Desktop Protocol Linux X Window System Windows 2000 Microsoft Windows Citrix Presentation Server NTFS Secure Shell Linux distribution Computer security Operating system Virtual memory OS/2 Windows Server 2003 Proxy server Common Unix Printing System Streaming media Digital rights management OpenBSD Wi-Fi Server File system Library (computer science) Microsoft .NET Control-Alt-Delete Port numbers Trusted computing GNOME Mandriva Linux Macromedia Flash USB flash drive Skype Network File System Thin client GNU Novell NetWare IBM PC compatible Bluetooth Computer virus Internet ITunes PlayStation 2 Free software Linspire FreeBSD Forth programming language Spyware Buffer overflow Unix Windows Vista Linux kernel Plan 9 (operating system) IPod Operating system advocacy Security-Enhanced Linux Mainframe computer Wget Java programming language Andrew Tridgell Timeline of computing 1990-forward Common Lisp Security focused operating system Modem Digital video recorder Gmail OpenOffice.org OpenGL NX bit Steam (content delivery) Rootkit BASIC programming language Apple Macintosh File Allocation Table AOL Instant Messenger Software bug History of the graphical user interface Mydoom Windows 3.x Web hosting Fritz-chip Sun Microsystems Password Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing DOS SUSE Linux Mozilla Firefox ReiserFS DragonFly BSD Windows registry PHP Partition (computing) Federal Standard 1037C Backdoor Device driver AirPort Local area network Superuser

where can i get microsoft access i have searched everywhere to find that either it's discontinued or out of stock i know that there is now but i need specifically ebay doesn't have it neither does amazon any other places thanks i have but i'm curious why you need this particular version when you configure access you can tell it to open in prior versions this sometimes don't require any conversion from your part the only problem is when you have used activex controls that are only available in the newer version if that is the case you can get the ocx files from the machine you coded the application and register them on the old computer you do this by looking the broken missing links on the vba reference section you place the ocx and dll files on a folder that is for this purpose only then you can browse to the directory from the vba reference section to fix the broken links some dll's require registering there is a command like regsvr that you need to use for this another option is to get the access developers edition and compile the code for a distributable package that can be installed in any computer that needs it it will contain the access run libraries if you need more info let me know  Synthesizer Keyboard instrument Synthpop Organ (music) Musical keyboard Musical Instrument Digital Interface Musical instrument Electronic organ Roland Corporation Analog synthesizer Herbie Hancock Pipe organ Synth rock Electronic musical instrument Player piano Keyboardist Kraftwerk Sampler (musical instrument) Skinny Puppy Hornbostel-Sachs Guy Sigsworth Wavetable synthesis Yamaha Corporation New Order Tony Banks (musician) Manual (music) Robert Moog Drum machine Ensoniq Just intonation The Who Pat Metheny Ministry (band) Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark Mellotron Freestyle music Hammond organ Fairlight CMI Electronic music Farfisa Union (album) Subtractive synthesis Vocoder Pat Metheny Group Wendy Carlos Korg Texas Instruments Guitar/synthesizer Texas Instruments TI-99/4A MIDI controller Minimoog Sequential Circuits Pedalboard Electronic art music Songwriter Tangerine Dream ARP Instruments, Inc.

why is windows vista needed for photoshop cs is there a way around this because all i want to do is do the free trial of cs and i'm not going to shell out bucks for a program that i heard sucks just for days if not where can i find photoshop cs i would assume it's at a somewhat discount price since there is a newer version thanks i downloaded the trial and i can't install it because i don't have vista according to a pop up so i don't know what the hell is going on i'm not sure who told you that but i downloaded and installed photoshop cs on my computer and i have windows xp vista isn't needed if it were than adobe and windows would have to create a contract between the two of them only because as people buy adobe for pc they'd have to buy windows vista also sorry but someone gave you misleading information  Library (computer science) Visual Basic Component Object Model Dynamic-Link Library MDAC Mac OS X Windows 2000 Internet Explorer Perl NPAPI AmigaOS BASIC programming language Mozilla Firefox Microsoft Microsoft Access Windows API Macromedia Flash Emacs Windows Vista System 7 (Macintosh) .NET assemblies Linux OpenOffice.org Spyware Microsoft Excel Blue screen of death Virtual memory Mouse (computing) Linux distribution Windows registry Windows Server 2003 File system Konqueror File Allocation Table DLL hell Unix Wine (software) History of Microsoft Windows Computer OS/2 Bluetooth Domain Name System 64-bit Xcode Portable Document Format Computer virus ITunes Steam (content delivery) Object Desktop CPAN Master Control Program Windows Explorer C plus plus Cocoa (API) USB flash drive Opera (web browser) System/36 WebObjects Public domain Mach kernel Wget Pretty Good Privacy C Sharp CPU cache Windows 3.x Forth programming language Microsoft Windows FreeBSD Microsoft Jet Database Engine Hello world program X86 Revision control Software testing Objective-C Gmail PHP DirectShow WordPerfect Stardock Netscape Communications Corporation World Wide Web XML C programming language OpenBSD Microsoft Office Comparison of web browsers Macintosh Finder IBM 1620

windows vista question installing stretchmame had no problem with stretchmame on xp after i had used the compatability option however with vista there is a problem because the line marked default options is greyed out this means that i can't set the default controller i e gamepad i am guessing that this can be cured by altering the properties but which ones to alter help would be much appreciated don't know if you could find an earlier version of mame if you tried the version you speak of is like from get mame or mamefx version or higher mame and vista don't always play nicely together goto the mame homepage and then to the blog page and read all about it all  Windows Vista Microsoft Windows Microsoft Office Windows XP Windows Server 2003 History of Microsoft Windows Mac OS X IBM PC compatible BASIC programming language Blue screen of death OpenGL Windows 2000 Apple Macintosh Wine (software) Digital rights management SAS System DirectX OpenStep Computer virus History of the graphical user interface Windows NT OpenOffice.org Portable Document Format WordPerfect OS/2 NTFS Windows Blackcomb Windows 3.x Timeline of computing 1990-forward Microsoft .NET Internet Information Services Visual Basic Macromedia Flash Java programming language Amiga Linux Windows API MS-DOS Copyright infringement of software Windows Presentation Foundation File system Windows Media Player Apple II family Copy protection Windows 95 Browser wars Stardock Operating system Personal computer File Allocation Table Fritz-chip Web browser Microsoft Agent Btrieve Novell NetWare FreeDOS X Window System Server Message Block The Walt Disney Company Component Object Model Microsoft Excel DR-DOS Quattro Pro Skype Sun Microsystems Software cracking Server Windows XP Media Center Edition Partition (computing) AmigaOS Internet Explorer History of computing hardware (1960s-present) NeXT Microsoft Word PowerPC Common criticisms of Microsoft Microsoft SQL Server Windows CE IPod TRS-80 System 7 (Macintosh) Windows Mobile GNOME Pretty Good Privacy MSN Messenger Game programming Tarantella, Inc.

faxing from computer i have done the configuring for the ms fax what is my fax number does my phone have to be connected to my computer what is a fax modem is that a completely different piece of hardware from a regular wireless modem i am trying to send a fax and it looks like it is going but it says that there was no dial tone and it may be busy not sure i am doing this correctly a fax is sent through the regular phone line as a regular phone call it is your regular phone number the phone must be available and not being used for internet dial up the fax has nothing to do with the internet if your computer came with a fax program then it is pretty certain that the built in modem will handle internet or fax it is not really practical to receive faxes without a dedicated line when the fax program is set to receive it will always answer your phone i have only used it to receive when i knew a fax was the next phone call  Blue screen of death Windows 2000 Capacitor plague Rootkit Knoppix Black screen of death USS Angler (SS-240) DragonFly BSD Racing flags Indianapolis Motor Speedway Apple II family Invader Zim Linux Need for Speed XScreenSaver Will Smith Windows XP Formula One regulations FreeDOS Common Unix Printing System Booting Expedition 9 2005-06 A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Great Britain 2005 United States Grand Prix LiveCD OpenBSD The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Meat Loaf Father's Day (Doctor Who) Jordan Grand Prix Gary Coleman Whirlpool (website) Hendrick Motorsports Disc brake Control Panel (Windows) Mass driver MythTV 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sport utility vehicle Naval Station Norfolk USS Yorktown (CV-10) MDAC Anti-virus software ISU-152 Installer M.A.S.K.

ram and cpu usage hello i kinda know what ram and cpu usage is but whats the difference i mean i have a gadget on my desktop which shows the ram and the cpu usage and sometimes ram is while cpu is only the cpu goes up when i run a lot of programs together but ram is always high even when i just turned on my pc i know i have to upgrade it but thats not my question what is the difference please dont just google search cpu usage and ram and give me the links i 've done this already thanks no vista just the vista transformation pack ram is high because i only have mb i ll upgrade soon as you probably already know ram is your system memory that is constantly being used as a temporary storage to access run any programs on your computer in your case your ram usage is high because you have a minimal amount of ram yet you are running a high number of background tasks cpu usage is when your processor is actually running the applications many background tasks do not require much processing power and hence this number is low until you run an application  Modem Voice over IP Private branch exchange GSM services Vertical service code ITU-T Phreaking Digital Subscriber Line Telegraphy Bluetooth HomePNA Telephone exchange Telephone number Hayes command set UK telephone numbering plan Telephone Universal Serial Bus X.25 Whois Telephone call Internet fraud Network Switching Subsystem Direct marketing North American Numbering Plan Control Panel (Windows) Help desk 9-1-1 Denial-of-service attack Predictive dialer Surveillance Softmodem Dialer Dual-tone multi-frequency Integrated Services Digital Network Phone fraud Serial port Telephone numbering plan Telephone booth Bulletin board system Apple Newton Computer network Emergency telephone number FidoNet Inmarsat Skype Wi-Fi Malware IP Multimedia Subsystem Satellite internet Floppy disk Cisco Systems IP address Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Television Wireless LAN RS-232 Ethernet Bell Labs Apple Open Collaboration Environment Call centre Communications protocol Coding theory Broadband Internet access Mobile phone Caller ID Customer relationship management Computer surveillance Konica Minolta Dial Radio clock Sega Saturn Teleprinter Blue box Embedded system Videotex Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Transmission Control Protocol Telecommunications Relay Service Pontianak, Indonesia Musical Instrument Digital Interface Software-defined radio Game programmer Spyware General Packet Radio Service WYSIWYG Radio Computer Gmail 1-1-1 Over-the-air programming AirPort IMac Password PlayStation 2 Apple Computer Call for help Nintendo Entertainment System

are limewire free downloads illegal i've been trying to convince my brother it was i want to know if i'm right to show proof yes technically the act of using limewire kazaa morpheus or any other p p file sharing system is perfectly legal however the act of sharing copyrighted music is what the authorities will prosecute for as you are allowing other users to download something which they should pay for for free the act of downloading music which is being shared by other users is illegal however the authorities will prosecute those who are sharing a significant amount of music like drugs they will go after the dealers not the users more input and advice the main question here is not whether limewire is illegal but if mp sharing or sharing of any files applications for that matter is illegal there have been lots of lawsuits where the music recording industry have tried to serve hefty fines etc to the companies individuals who encourage and facilitate the sharing of files between people however in recent court cases the decision has been made that it is not plausible to adequately place blame on people since all software such as limewire does is act as a catalyst the heart and soul of limewire winmx and kazaa is the people like you or i that download files and likewise make files on our own pc's available for others in order to 'win' the recording industry would have to sue each and every one of us which would simply be a too difficult and costly task by taking software such as limwire off the internet by way of force all that would happen is that another group of individuals would come up with somehting new and another head would grow in its' place it's like trying to police an individual taking a new cd that he bought over to his friend's house and copying it on to his pc virtually impossible  Mozilla Firefox HTTP cookie Mouse (computing) Mozilla Application Suite Spyware Windows XP Web browser Gmail Opera (web browser) Avant Browser Web design Comparison of web browsers Macromedia Flash Wireless Application Protocol Java programming language Internet Explorer OmniWeb Konqueror Cascading Style Sheets AS/400 Command Language Ajax (programming) Internet privacy Hyperlink Hello world program Stopping e-mail abuse HTML element Online shop Download manager Browser Helper Object HyperCard Netscape Browser Tabbed document interface Object Desktop World Wide Web AmigaOS Netscape Navigator Pop-up ad Malware Internet Explorer for Mac Internet Explorer shell Uniform Resource Locator Browser wars Option key Social bookmarking Flickr Common Unix Printing System Wiki ICab XML Remotely operated vehicle Palm OS Minesweeper (computer game) Page widening History of the graphical user interface International Phonetic Alphabet PlayStation Portable Sega Saturn E-mail Windows Explorer Safari (web browser) PNG Greasemonkey Sega Dreamcast Wipeout (game) Mosaic (web browser) Uploading and downloading DOM Events Microsoft AntiSpyware Knoppix Proxy server Thumbnail gallery post Kazaa GIF Internet fraud Danger Hiptop Visual Basic .NET Emacs Orkut Tab (GUI) Klik Online marketing Drag-and-drop HyperText Transfer Protocol Netscape Communications Corporation WorldWideWeb Phishing Web banner Distributed computing Mouse gesture Search engine optimization Blogger 2channel Screenshot Google Desktop Python programming language Microsoft Windows Last.fm Macintosh Finder JavaScript Prank flash

what is the appropriate definition of backend and frontend softwares please i neeed any one that can assist me in the definition of backend and frontend softawres thanks the terms front end and back end refer to the initial and the end stages of a process flow these terms acquire more special meanings in particular areas the general idea is that the front end is responsible for collecting input from the user which can be in a variety of forms and processing it in such a way that it conforms to a specification that the back end can use the connection of the front end to the back end is a kind of interface in software design the front end is the part of a software system that interacts directly with the user and the back end comprises the components that process the output from the front end the separation of software systems into front ends and back ends is an abstraction that serves to keep the different parts of the system separated hope this helps cheers  Optical character recognition Portable Document Format Enterprise content management Automatic number plate recognition Common Unix Printing System Astrophysics Data System Captcha TeX Geographic information system Mouse (computing) Digital photography Nintendo GameCube Unicode Digital Stereoscopy Gmail Windows Vista Screenshot Document management system Paper Spyware Image scanner Atari 8-bit family File format Warez C programming language Wallpaper group Uniform Resource Locator AmigaOS Project Gutenberg Handwriting recognition Federal Standard 1037C Fax Computer virus Machine vision Mac OS X v10.4 United States Postal Service PlayStation Portable HTML element PostScript Chinese character CPU cache Natural deduction Book Sorting algorithm HyperText Transfer Protocol Macromedia Flash Raymond Kurzweil Google Desktop Photography Punch card JPEG Autostereogram Television System/34 Reading (activity) Google Hello world program Digital video Computer printer Pixel Copy protection Chinese input methods for computers Konica Minolta Radio Newline Killian documents Cryptography Windows 2000 Electronic voting On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Page table Artificial intelligence Scanning electron microscope Persistence of vision Printing press Traditional animation ZIP Code Drawing ImageMagick Digital art Barcode DVD Embedded system WordPerfect One-time pad Distributed Proofreaders PNG ZX Spectrum Stopping e-mail abuse Phishing Compact disc SAS System Steganography Digital rights management Optical mark recognition Tagged Image File Format Web page

why does the text color change to red and also underlined in microsoft word i just opened a simple word document with tables and autoshapes in it when i opened it the letterhead and autoshapes were missing and whenever i type the letters are red and underlined i did not change the font nor underline how do i get it back to basic black no underline i've gone to format and font but it doesn't show that the color has changed and is underlined sounds to me like you've accidentally turned on track changes try this for word xp and possibly right click on any menu and see if the reviewing toolbar is checked if not i'm done but if it is deselect it and watch which toolbar disappears then select it again to bring it back hover over each button on the reviewing toolbar to find the one labeled track changes it's usually near the right end and has a bunch of red lines surprise on a page as its icon it should look selected deselect it try adding some text to your document and see if this cured the problem it should now to get rid of the stuff you already have in red again on the reviewing toolbar find the button that says accept changes it's usually in the middle and has a check mark as its icon click the down arrow for this list box and select accept all changes in document you may have to give a yes or ok click to something but this should do it good luck  Commodore 64 Atari ST File Allocation Table Linux USB flash drive NeXT BIOS Sony NTFS DOS Hard disk Apple Macintosh Redundant array of independent disks Knoppix Commodore International ZX Spectrum Apple II family IBM PC AmigaOS File system Secure Digital card Bootable business card Alcoholics Anonymous Linux distribution Western Digital Drive letter assignment Atari 8-bit family Floppy disk Commodore DOS Copy protection Computer virus Blue screen of death Apple IIGS Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Wintel Image Warez Slackware MS-DOS Data recovery BASIC programming language X86 DOS Comparison Amiga Game demo Netscape Navigator System 7 (Macintosh) Microsoft Office Data remanence Dyne:bolic King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow Commodore 1581 Dd (Unix) History of computer and video games A4000 SAM Coup__ Covermount Backup Boot image control Vi DNA Password Game development IMac Xerox Star Windows 2000 Electronic Arts Windows XP Bungie Studios Atari TT030 Advertising Marshall Plan Copland Finnish language Amstrad PCW Zip drive Digital photography Amway WordStar Disk formatting Amstrad CPC Macromedia Flash ZIP (file format) Wealth Type-in program SuperDisk PHP Famicom Disk System Botulism Commodore SX-64 TRS-80 X-COM: UFO Defense Aster CT-80 Timeline of computing 1990-forward Device driver GRand Unified Bootloader Digital rights management Strap-on dildo Numerical control History of the graphical user interface

i need some advice regarding a microsoft word document format the document is to be a column layout on a landscape configuration the paper used is x x legal what i am having difficulty doing is getting the columns to be centered exactly after the document is printed and the paper is folded into four equal sizes or quartered as some would say the goal is to get the data within the columns to appear properly centered after the document has been folded into four panels specifically when i move one column into proper position the other margins between the columns re size automatically can that be bypassed in some way i don't have formal training my computer skills are just into intermediate and what i know so far is what i have learned through trial and error plus the good advice from folks that i have asked online if you have any questions you can include them with your answer or you can e mail me i thank you in advance manis i have done that prior to posting the question mountie thank you kindly for your help you can change column spacing individually by removing the check mark underneath 'width and spacing' at 'equal column width' but i don't think this is the way to achieve what you want i think you need to have your column spacings twice the width of your page left and right margins printers have different minimum margin widths mine is half an inch cm so you would need to check this out first file page setup margins reduce your left and right margins equally to their limit and click ok a message will appear if you go outside the printers limits assuming that your left and right margins are half an inch wide you will need to make your column spacing inch wide when folded there should be a half inch each side the same as your margins and your text should be centered  Anti-virus software Library (computer science) Windows API Computer virus Dynamic-Link Library Trojan horse (computing) Rootkit Windows XP C Sharp Mydoom Btrieve OS/2 .NET assemblies MDAC DLL hell Component Object Model Computer security Spyware Symbian OS Microsoft Malware C programming language Windows 2000 Virus Blue screen of death Hello world program Portable Executable Master Control Program Objective-C Visual Basic Skype Datatype Emacs Lisp Position independent code Name mangling Game Maker Microsoft Jet Database Engine Internet security Macromedia Flash Python programming language Linker C plus plus Scheme programming language Compiler Source code Java programming language Wine (software) Perl NPAPI PaX Java platform Self-modifying code Lisp programming language Cocoa (API) MinGW Norton AntiVirus AS/400 MUMPS Emacs Ebook Buffer overflow BASIC programming language RPG programming language High Level Assembly Cheating in Counter-Strike Compiler optimization Ruby programming language HyperCard Windows registry Linked list CPU cache AmigaOS Assembly language Visual Basic .NET Stopping e-mail abuse Microsoft Windows Euphoria programming language Delphi programming language Software cracking Self-replication Mach kernel Brainfuck Internet Explorer PHP Java virtual machine Programming language Computer Virtual memory Enterprise content management Thunk Polymorphism (computer science) Windows Vista Computer program

photoshop and corel paint keygens not trying to pirate recently lost my hard drive and had to get a new one i have no idea where the boxes are containing the keygens to these products are i had already bought both programs what do i do i rely on these programs but now i cant use them because i dont have the keygens anyone know where i can get them im not pirating because like i said i had already bought the copies and i really dont feel like paying another couple hundred to get them again if you purchased electronic copies no cd download only versions or if you ordered through the companies' sites they may have your information on file email their support departments for assistance in obtaining your correct registration key codes you will need all the information from when you purchased version numbers your email address at the time of purchase and likely the method of payment possibly complete card info i suggest that if this is not a workable solution some companies have a clause in the license for electronic delivery software that says you are out of luck if you lose the purchase verification if you have a webmail address look to make sure you have not archived the purchase receipt emails yahoo and gmail both allow you to keep mail which will probably be instrumental in regaining legitimate copies of your software using a keygen program even if you own the software legitimately is the same as stealing legally speaking you must use the key that you paid for to activate the software or it is still pirated good luck  GIMP GIMP Toolkit Microsoft .NET Windows 2000 Wget Btrieve Knoppix Common Unix Printing System PHP Mandriva Linux .NET assemblies Windows registry Uniform Resource Locator HTTP cookie Domain Name System Dialer Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing Mozilla Firefox GNU EMule BitTorrent Windows API User agent MegaMan Battle Network C Sharp Blue screen of death MDAC MSH (shell) MegaMan NT Warrior LiteStep IPod Qt (toolkit) MegaMan Battle Network (video game) Installer Digital audio workstation SUSE Linux BZFlag Multiple document interface Rootkit World Wide Web MSN Messenger Windows Mobile Screenshot System 7 (Macintosh) XSL Transformations Damn Small Linux MIRC Minesweeper (computer game) Session Initiation Protocol Kazaa WiX Anti-virus software Scheme programming language Web crawler HyperText Transfer Protocol Lazarus (software) CPAN Slapt-get Hello world program AOL Instant Messenger Linux Python programming language Subversion (software) WAMP Trojan horse (computing) MediaMax CD-3 Internet censorship in mainland China Internet Microsoft Windows SAML Windows Vista Mozilla Application Suite OpenOffice.org Widget toolkit Tux Paint Representational State Transfer Concurrent Versions System TikiWiki WASTE FFmpeg Windows Server 2003 Adobe Photoshop MegaMan.EXE Advanced Packaging Tool Unicode StepMania Patch (computing) ReactOS Windows XP VirtualDub NetNavi Proxy server KDE Website Warez Open-source software Apache HTTP Server Windows Installer

firefox alpha i want to try out the firefox alpha v but ive never tried a non finished version of anything so i was wondering what should i do differently with it and what are the risks of using it more answers the better thanks sooooo much d first alpha software tends to be buggier than beta so expect a rocky ride in fact i would keep another browser even ie warmed up and ready to be pressed into service if ff really goes south and is unusable unlikely but possible people who do alpha and beta testing regularly won't install such software on any mission critical machines beyond that it can be frustrating but fun to know you took part in it the mozilla people will expect you to report bugs or anomalies to them probably via bugzilla which is an experience all its own try to have fun  Adobe Photoshop IPhoto Microsoft Office GIMP GIF Game programmer Fark.com PNG Internet phenomenon Photoshop contest Tourist guy Something Awful Paint Shop Pro Uploading and downloading Finale notation program Goatse.cx Warez Avatar (virtual reality) Chess Digital image editing Trademark Photoshopping Something Awful Forums Spyware Nude celebrities on the Internet IPod photo Bulletin board system Adobe Systems ITunes Microsoft .NET Video on demand IPod Web crawler Kazaa Podcasting Playboy (magazine) Download manager Online casino Favicon JavaScript Dialer Graphics MIRC Pornography Internet fraud Product activation Good Times CNET Software art Online service provider Tux Paint QBasic PlayStation Portable The Internet Movie Database ImageMagick Microsoft Windows Adobe Illustrator Every time you masturbate___ God kills a kitten Object Desktop Google Desktop Bert is Evil Pretty Good Privacy B3ta Bryce Outlook Express Nintendo DS ReplayTV Internet pornography Dave Matthews Band Software cracking 4chan Napster Child pornography Online music store Macromedia Flash Java programming language User agent Bbc.co.uk Internet service provider Computer science Computer virus Weekly newspaper File sharing E-mail art Advanced Packaging Tool Internet Skype Internet Explorer Extreme Programming Plugin Microsoft AntiSpyware Weezer Computer and video games Abandonware Attack of the Show!

norton is it unflushable belarc advisor reports that i have norton internet security realtime file scanning on belarc's capitals but i uninstalled nis following dissatisfaction with both the product and the pricing policy i use zone alarm security suite now which belarc correctly detects i used norton's removal tool then deleted a dozen or so directories which included norton or symantec in their name there remain a score of entries in the registry which i am loathe to tamper with can anyone point me to a site which might boost my confidence i don't want to use a registry cleaner it's a question of trust or control i suppose norton joins aol realplayer and stella artois in the list of things which ought not to be allowed in contact with a pc when you uninstall norton it makes the bad assumption that you will be reinstalling it sooner or later and thus leaves a large amount of content on your computer i wouldn't worry about the registry so much just delete the directories that are in your program files folder the registry is just one of those things that becomes more and more like a graveyard for uninstalled programs as you use your computer only way to really deal with it is backing up what you want and reformatting alot of computer experts reccommend doing this every years or so anyway  Gmail HTTP cookie Opera (web browser) MSN Messenger BitTorrent Windows XP Jabber NTFS Apache HTTP Server Streaming media Windows Server 2003 Mozilla Firefox MP3 Webmail IPod Google Scalable Vector Graphics Apple Computer File format GIF Files-11 Windows 2000 Virtual memory E-mail Unix Windows Vista Proxy server Tagged Image File Format Ajax (programming) Hotmail File system ITunes Concurrent Versions System Linux Spyware JavaServer Pages XML Python programming language Portable Document Format Base64 Macromedia Flash Internet Oracle database Apple II family USB flash drive Online music store Database Google Talk Wget Electronic commerce File Transfer Protocol GNU HyperText Transfer Protocol Federal Standard 1037C Secure Shell Hard disk Microsoft Microsoft Windows Konqueror Microsoft .NET Wiki Comparison of file systems Commodore 64 Sun Microsystems Unicode Internet censorship in mainland China Emacs Computer file Digital audio player User agent PHP Server E-mail spam Web browser Session Initiation Protocol Common Unix Printing System Open source culture FairPlay File sharing Sega Dreamcast Google search Newline Computer storage Skype Delta encoding Early IBM disk storage Stardock Disk image Palm OS Flash memory Btrieve Password cracking Windows API Windows Mobile TikiWiki DVD Freenet ICalendar

what is so different about vista that makes most programs unworkable on its os will this problem be fixed i badly need a new computer current one is win i wish to play games like sim city gta and true crimes on a new computer is this possible is vista just a bad os that should make me settle for win xp no dont believe all that negative stuff about vista i dont get why people hate it soo much i have had mine since it became commercially available it does not have many program drive compatibility issues and if it does when the setup fails you can choose to run in compatibility mode the only thing i do not like at all is if you buy a computer with on board graphics no graphics card and you use the aero gui it will hog all your ram so i had to swich mine to the classic windows gui to save ram and im trying to intsall windows xp on a gb partition but i need support for raid drivers but i dont have a floppy drive also there is a better chance of those games having better performace than running those on a vista computer since vista requires more computer power  Spyware Uninstaller Windows registry Computer security Windows 2000 Gmail File system Microsoft Windows Pretty Good Privacy Rootkit ITunes Windows Installer Computer virus E-mail spam NTFS Windows XP Trusted computing Norton Utilities AOL Instant Messenger Macromedia Flash Debugging Enterprise content management Kazaa Stopping e-mail abuse Microsoft Norton Commander Password Computer Open Directory Project Library (computer science) Hard disk Computer forensics Filename extension Censorware Mozilla Application Suite Mac OS X Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Netscape Communications Corporation Macintosh Finder British national identity card Windows Server 2003 Phishing Symantec 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines New.net System 7 (Macintosh) Burglar alarm MSN Messenger Master Control Program Ghost (software) Anti-virus software Instant messaging Perl Unicode Mydoom Java programming language IPod Object Desktop Expert system Norton AntiVirus Directory Management information system Firewall (networking) Barbara Boxer Surveillance America Online Model (economics) Acronym and initialism PNG Spam (electronic) MDAC Backup PHP Computer software Killian documents Files-11 Windows Vista Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Bluetooth Proxy server Dialer NTFS junction point 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Group Policy Google CPAN Mutual fund System/36 Common Unix Printing System Slashdot subculture Wikipedia Mach kernel Digital rights management Linked list CPU cache

i cannot set a desktop wallpaper on one user account only any suggestions on how to correct this we have user accounts set up in windows two of the accounts will let us set a desktop wallpaper the third account will not display a wallpaper you can briefly see it displayed when you log off through the control panel browse for images is even inactive for this one user account only without knowing which version of windows you're using it's difficult to offer anything specific but i'd try creating a th account just to see if everything works the way it should if it does you can probably rule out any system problems and just chalk it up to a glitch or hiccup when that uncooperative rd account was created in that case i'd delete the rd account rename the newly created th account and set it up but if the th account also doesn't work correctly it might be a problem with a damaged system file if you have your original install cd you could try running a system file check check click start run type in sfc scannow ok no quotes and notice the space between sfc and scannow if any damaged or missing system files are located you'll be prompted to insert the install disk files will then be repaired or replaced as needed the scan could take over an hour depending on what it finds wwbgd  File system Windows 2000 Windows XP File Allocation Table Spyware NTFS Object Desktop Uninstaller Gmail Windows Installer ITunes Windows Me Blue screen of death Linux Internet Explorer Macromedia Flash Computer virus Partition (computing) System 7 (Macintosh) Virtual memory Btrieve Windows registry Stardock New.net Rootkit Filename extension Windows Explorer IPod Macintosh Finder Xerox Star Mac OS X Enterprise content management Library (computer science) Unicode Google Computer File format Windows 3.x AmigaOS Plaintext ASCII art USB flash drive Sony Comparison of file systems Mach kernel OS/2 NTFS junction point System/36 AOL Instant Messenger MSN Messenger Password cracking Domain Name System Host file ZIP (file format) Master Control Program Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Path (computing) Windows Server 2003 Wget Apple II family Microsoft .NET Symbolic link History of the graphical user interface Backup Computer forensics Kazaa Computer storage Common Unix Printing System Directory HTTP cookie Redundant array of independent disks Linked list Defragmentation Data recovery Microsoft Windows MDAC Windows Vista Surveillance IMac Server System/34 Architecture of Windows 2000 FreeDOS Apple Macintosh Computer file NX bit Skype Metadata Novell NetWare Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis RPM Package Manager PHP Windows 95 Floppy disk Perl MS-DOS Pretty Good Privacy

how do i export project in visual c i have coded a application in visual c but i don't know how to export it so i can post it on my website for people to download okay but i don't really want to give away the source file how would i make it into a application for people to use i know where to find it but when i put it on my website the users get this error the application configuration is incorrect re installing the application may fix this problem i think i linked to the crt and i will link to it in the app folder but what i can't figure out is how to make one of these sorry for the stupid question you can either distribute the sourcefiles or the binary file as you made an application you clearly have the binaries from building the source right you can post the binary and any necessary files like shared libraries or post the source files you need to give people a way of building it easily so either include the project file solution file as well or use makefiles jam scons whatever to create a build system edit what's this about making an application when you build your code you get an application right how did you code your application without ever running the binary once if you're having trouble finding the built application look in the source directory or more accurately the project directories there should be a build folder with debug or release subfolders you're obviously interested in release more info i googled a bit myself you can do so on the terms application configuration incorrect http www gamedev net community forums topic asp topic id whichpage and http www chat com this application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect may be pertinent you have an exe if you have a manifest file in the directory you should be including that in the online download as well it s also possible you dynamically linked the crt in which case unless the crt is present on the user s system because he is a developer using the same language and compiler etc you need to ship them as well copying from c program files microsoft visual studio vc redist x microsoft vc crt to the application folder should do the trick if you have another version of vc just look in the appropriate redistributable directory  Windows 2000 Computer virus Object Desktop Redundant array of independent disks Bluetooth File system Steam (content delivery) Common Unix Printing System PlayStation Portable Computer wallpaper Mozilla Firefox Spyware Gmail Macintosh Finder Hard disk Blue screen of death Linux Microsoft Windows AmigaOS Unicode Malware Emacs Windows 3.x Opera (web browser) NTFS Windows Vista Super Nintendo Entertainment System Knoppix Screenshot System 6 X Window System Mac OS X Windows registry MDAC Rootkit Windows Installer Pretty Good Privacy History of Microsoft Windows Windows Me Mouse (computing) File format Partition (computing) Btrieve Linux distribution Library (computer science) OpenBSD Floppy disk IPod Laptop Control Panel (Windows) Virtual memory Debugging Konqueror Stardock Oscilloscope Backup Visual Basic Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Xerox Star System/36 MSN Messenger PHP Expert system System/34 Windows Server 2003 USB flash drive Apple Macintosh Embedded system Domain Name System Digital Equipment Corporation Windows 95 Internet Relay Chat Ebook Disk cloning RSTS/E Patch (computing) Stopping e-mail abuse Mach kernel Microsoft Jet Database Engine GunZ The Duel Freenet Java programming language Screensaver Anti-virus software Mozilla Application Suite Diablo II: Lord of Destruction OS/2 PNG KDE

if its in a cache folder is it ok to be deleted hello i am a mac user i just went through my computer to clean up things and i noticed a lot of my files for example pictures were saved in so many different folders i had plenty to delete but as i was deleting i started to delete things in the folders i saw title cache everything is in my recycle bin but before i delete them permanently i want to make sure if it's ok to delete anything and everything that is located in a cache folder so am i safe to proceed thank you i also should state that i've came across many different cache folders in different files is it safe to delete items from any cache folder i just don't want to delete something important yanno the cache folder is used to store images locally so that the next time you need to access it it will load quickly from your local hard drive rather than having to download it from a web site or wherever so yes you can delete items in your cache folder the next time you visit the site that the file came from it will just need to be downloaded again a little bit slower to load perhaps but harmless to delete  Windows XP Windows Media Player Macromedia Flash ITunes Screenshot Object Desktop Minesweeper (computer game) Spyware IBM PC compatible IPod Computer virus Pretty Good Privacy Blue screen of death Opera (web browser) Microsoft Windows Macintosh Finder Stardock RuneScape cheats Windows 2000 Mouse (computing) Mach kernel Stopping e-mail abuse Internet fraud E-mail spam QuickTime Debugging AmigaOS Hello world program Public-key cryptography MSN Messenger Patch (computing) HyperCard Windows Vista Computer and video games PlayStation 2 Windows 3.x Windows Mobile Virtual memory Super Mario Bros. 3 X Window System Gmail AOL Instant Messenger World of Warcraft Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Musical Instrument Digital Interface GunZ The Duel Windows 95 Phishing Kylie Minogue Doom 3 Computer forensics Steam (content delivery) Enigma machine Prank flash Buffer overflow Jumpstart 3rd Grade Self programming language Dance Dance Revolution SonicStage Common Unix Printing System Embedded system MapleStory Visual Basic .NET Visual Basic Digital rights management Pop'n Music IP (complexity) Mozilla Firefox Pop-up ad The Sims 2: University Server Message Block History of Microsoft Windows Backup Killian documents Bubble Bobble In The Groove (game) Palm OS Poker jargon Computer role-playing game Pump It Up History of the graphical user interface Apple Macintosh L4 microkernel family Hash table System Shock Taskbar Digital photography MDAC Mac OS X Gramophone record Internet Explorer CPU design NX bit Lemmings (computer game) Diablo II Morse Code Betting (poker) E-mail Web design

does windows vista delete everything in your computer like if you install it will it delete everything if you don't do it the right way it depends if you're doing an upgrade to an existing operating system like xp or if you're doing a full install a full install requires that the entire hard drive be reformatted that's geek speak for erasing everything on the hard drive everything then the new system vista is installed you absolutely have to back up save all programs documents photos music etc if you do a full install an upgrade is supposed to save all your personal data but it doesn't always work that way so it's a good idea to back up any time you put in a new system wwbgd  ITunes File system Macintosh Finder CPU cache System 7 (Macintosh) Computer virus File Allocation Table Gmail Mac OS X Windows XP Cache Virtual memory Windows registry NTFS Object Desktop Windows 2000 NTFS junction point Mozilla Thunderbird Library (computer science) Windows Vista Hard disk Mouse (computing) Directory Linked list .NET assemblies Hash table Domain Name System Google Computer Mac OS X v10.4 Disk image Partition (computing) LiveCD Host file Web page System/36 The Sims 2 Uploading and downloading Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Launchd Emacs Internet Message Access Protocol Linux PlayStation Portable Web crawler Java programming language Bluetooth Backup Mod (computer gaming) Computer security Blue screen of death Trusted computing GIF IPod Proxy server Windows Me Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Floppy disk AmigaOS Lotus Notes Google search Apple typography HyperCard System 6 Danger Hiptop RISC Cue sheet Screenshot Webmail Nintendo Revolution ZIP (file format) Windows Explorer File Transfer Protocol Compiler optimization Freenet Konqueror Redundant array of independent disks Mach kernel Garbage collection (computer science) Wget Melissa worm Getting Things Done Spring operating system HFS Plus ILife Internet Representational State Transfer System/34 Mac OS Kazaa Outlook Express Malware Website History of the graphical user interface Mozilla Firefox Neopets Stardock PlayStation 3

dvd decrypter i have dvd decrypter when i click on mode what does file ifo and iso mean what does the box on the right mean it says vts in video editing ifo normally refers to a file on dvd video disc and stands for information while the main content of dvd video disc are the vob files which contain the actual mpeg audio video and subtitle streams the ifo files provide information for dvd player where dvd video disc's chapters start where certain audio tracks are located etc iso sensitivity expresses the speed of photographic negative materials formerly expressed as asa since digital cameras do not use film but use image sensors instead the iso equivalent is usually given what iso denotes is how sensitive the image sensor is to the amount of light present the higher the iso the more sensitive the image sensor and therefore the possibility to take pictures in low light situations and where you would have needed to physically change to a different roll of film if you wanted a different iso speed digital technology allows you to simply dial one in in this way you can record images taken at different iso speeds on the same memory card i dont use that specific software so cant help you for the last one good luck  Windows XP Windows 2000 Linux Computer virus File system IBM PC compatible Mac OS X Blue screen of death Macintosh Finder Knoppix NTFS AmigaOS Redundant array of independent disks Malware MDAC WordStar Trusted computing Hard disk Partition (computing) History of Microsoft Windows File Allocation Table Apple Macintosh System 7 (Macintosh) The Sims 2 Xerox Star Windows Server 2003 IPod Hash table Disk cloning Macromedia Flash Windows Presentation Foundation Windows Me OpenGL Disk formatting Copy protection IA-32 ITunes Pretty Good Privacy CPU cache Data remanence Virtual memory System/36 Portable Document Format Personal computer Emacs Computer security Booting Btrieve Universal Serial Bus Surveillance HyperCard USB flash drive Enterprise content management Microsoft Office Spyware DragonFly BSD Computer Windows Installer Backup Atari ST Mach kernel Opera (web browser) PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Computer forensics Fritz-chip Anti-virus software Apple IIGS Apple II family Linked list Game programmer Steam (content delivery) Library (computer science) TiVo Windows 3.x Theory of conduct Unicode Game programming Common Unix Printing System Embedded system Domain Name System Page table Expert system PNG Computer multitasking Perl X86 NX bit Thread (computer science) Buffer overflow Floppy disk C plus plus History of the graphical user interface Metadata Architecture of Windows 2000 AppleScript Symbolic link Comparison of file systems

dvd ripper i need a dvd ripper that i can download for free what programs are good first get dvd decrypter search for it on google you might want to get it from the uk sight put in dvd open up dvd decrypter click mode and switch to ifo mode then click the big rip button w the green arrow this should take around min now download autogk from here http www autogk me uk index php name downloads d op viewdownloaddetails lid this will install a couple of programs and the xvid codec open up autogk click on the input folder browse to the ripped files from dvd decrypter c dvdname video ts and select the ifo file when asked which track to select pick the longest one below that set the output location below that you can probably leave the audio track alone and then select any suntitle tracks you want if any below that you choose output size you can pick a target size in mb mb gb or you can pick a quality from the actual dvd i might be wrong but i beleive for a hr dvd will give about a gb file when encoding to xvid again i might be completely wrong about this then click on advanced options you can choose output resolution i usually choose but you might find this a bit small also you can choose audio bit rate and if you want cbr or vbr vbr more quality but takes longer also you can choose what codec to encode to however if you want to use divx you need to download it from somewhere and also autogk doesn't support newest divx so just do a google search for divx if you want to use divx any after setting the advance options click on add job and then click start this will take a while maybe around ten hours so i usually do it overnight anyway you should end up with a file that you can now watch in windows media player sorry this was such a long answer but it's the best free way i know that always works good luck  Uniform Resource Locator HyperText Transfer Protocol Web server Port numbers LimeWire Domain Name System Wget World Wide Web Domain name HTTP cookie Warez SAML Squid cache Spyware CPAN Toronto Pearson International Airport Router Uniform Resource Identifier Jabber Gnutella Website Tarom Apache HTTP Server Pow-wow Common Unix Printing System File-sharing program Opera house Unix Mozilla Firefox Virtual hosting Paris Magnet link Session Initiation Protocol Karaoke ITunes Music Store Phishing Frankfurt International Airport Swamithoppepathi Mormon Napster Abdullah __calan Network Time Protocol Kingsford Smith International Airport Ecclesiastical Latin Internet Slash (punctuation) Web cache Web browser 400 (number) ___And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead Gaelic handball Adria Airways El Al BitTorrent Wikisource RealNetworks Slashdot trolling phenomena Quotation mark FS Charles de Gaulle MGM Studios, Inc. v.

windows movie maker problem please help i love making amvs and slideshows but my windows movie maker sp version makes me very angry when i'm about to do something like adding pictures or special effects etc it stops and goes unresponsive and i have to restart the pc but luckily i can save what i done so far before it restarts almost every time if i'll keep restarting the computer will have some problems too i have checked the movie maker for viruses and all it has are some errours but i dunno what kind of errours it has and what should i do to fix them so if someone had the same problem or knows about movie makers please help me everyone i thank you all you all just made my day thank you i'm sorry anime kid but i'm busy and i can't join your group even though i love beyblade very much sorry but thanks for the invitation anyway and for the advice so in other words your windows movie maker freezes if you are using a large number of contents or items for your movie the software can shut down as well sometimes the software will shut down automatically without giving you time to save your project go to options under tools click on the general tab see the three checkboxes and the second one said save autorecover info every minutes this will help automatically save your work every any given number of minutes so you do not lose so much work you already done i recommend saving it automatically very often because you never know a power failure will happen the computer suddenly crashes or the software just shuts down i would automatically save minutes you can go to www papajohn org and see the left pane there you will find a folder problem solving xp click the plus sign by that to expand the tree and find the document about hangs and crashes there's lots of information about the issue do you really need this many contents for your movie sometimes you need to remove items unless you really really need them welcome to the world of editing i hope you are using windows movie maker and not you will need service pack for the fact that you need to restart your system tells me that it is possible that you have too many programs running at once in the background when using windows when using the software close out any programs you do not feel you need you can hold down alt del ctrl buttons to get to your task manager review any programs you have running if any of them look strange or should not be running just hit end task do the same but go to the processes tab and see if any look strange or should not be running and hit end processes if you don't know what any of those or abbreviations mean just do a google on them before ending them you do not want to end processes that can affect your operating system if you do not know what you are doing uninstall any programs you do not need also sometimes other filters can interfere with windows movie maker go to options then tools again and go to the compatibility tab uncheck any filters that may be causing a problem let me know if i am misunderstanding your question or if this doesn't work email me at bigboy us yahoo com  Windows Vista Macintosh Finder Windows 2000 Computer virus Mac OS X History of the graphical user interface Microsoft Windows Mouse (computing) Object Desktop Screenshot History of Microsoft Windows Computer AmigaOS Mach kernel Macromedia Flash Partition (computing) IPod Windows Me IBM PC compatible Apple Macintosh ITunes File Allocation Table Stardock OS/2 Google Windows Server 2003 System 6 Windows registry X Window System System/36 Bluetooth Apple typography Xerox Star LiveCD Blue screen of death Windows 3.x Start Menu Copy protection Spatial file manager Gmail OpenGL Mac OS X v10.4 Google Desktop System 7 (Macintosh) Portable Document Format Windows 95 Outlook Express Self programming language Internet Relay Chat Konqueror Microsoft Library (computer science) Malware USB flash drive Apple Open Collaboration Environment QuickTime Windows Mobile File format Spam (electronic) Virtual memory Minesweeper (computer game) Stopping e-mail abuse Screensaver Atari 8-bit family Floppy disk ZIP (file format) Btrieve Hello world program Control Panel (Windows) Backup Icon (computing) Spyware Commodore 64 Directory MSN Messenger ILife NTFS junction point Trojan horse (computing) Cmd.exe AOL Instant Messenger Prank flash Personal computer .NET assemblies AppleScript HyperCard Common User Access PlayStation Portable Apple IIGS TeX OpenOffice.org Steam (content delivery) Forth programming language Microsoft Word Drag-and-drop

is limewire pro illegal i here that the free version of limewire is illegal i wonder if pro is legal whether limewire is legal technically the act of using limewire kazaa morpheus or any other p p file sharing system is perfectly legal however the act of sharing copyrighted music is what the authorities will prosecute for as you are allowing other users to download something which they should pay for for free the act of downloading music which is being shared by other users is illegal however the authorities will prosecute those who are sharing a significant amount of music like drugs they will go after the dealers not the users more input and advice the main question here is not whether limewire is illegal but if mp sharing or sharing of any files applications for that matter is illegal there have been lots of lawsuits where the music recording industry have tried to serve hefty fines etc to the companies individuals who encourage and facilitate the sharing of files between people however in recent court cases the decision has been made that it is not plausible to adequately place blame on people since all software such as limewire does is act as a catalyst the heart and soul of limewire winmx and kazaa is the people like you or i that download files and likewise make files on our own pc's available for others in order to 'win' the recording industry would have to sue each and every one of us which would simply be a too difficult and costly task by taking software such as limwire off the internet by way of force all that would happen is that another group of individuals would come up with somehting new and another head would grow in its' place it's like trying to police an individual taking a new cd that he bought over to his friend's house and copying it on to his pc virtually impossible as we all know technically ftp is legal in itself as a mode of communication and data transfer it has really unbelievably been used since not long after the second world war the net was invented as a communication method that would be almost self healing after an attack by offering billions of alternative routes for data transfer in itself it is pure genious and gives us communication that our ancestors would only dream of music piracy has shot up tenfold since the advent of programmes like napster the us uk governments thought the problems had died when they passed acts that shut these sites down these primative fileshare sites actively promoted the fact that they offered music free to download through their shareware but the new breed is very different programmes like kazaa limewire winmx and e donkey are just bacteria that feed on the source that almost all internet users harbour in their own homes a piece of software is an appliance like a tumbledryer a tumbledrier dries your clothes an ftp application downloads files it doesn't know what a particular file is what it shows or how it works it just does its job but the pitfall is that this software can pass copyrighted music unreleased hollywood blockbusters expensive software child pornography important and censored documents images films in an unbiased way between countries individuals criminals and governments so limewire is technically legal but it and programmes like it have a finite lifespan and i would wager that within the next few years maybe at the most filesharing will be another heavily taxed weapon in our worldwide governmental arsenal it's the first opportunity for the world to get something for free really free grab the chance now and go forth my children and get what you need but make sure it's legal just because you can get it it doesn't mean that the stuff you have is legal steer clear of terrorism movies images child porn pornography of a corrupt nature in general and any file that your conscience and society will not accept but otherwise enjoy this rare blip in history when the majority notched up a rare victory on the bedpost of our existence limewire is completely illegal one of the main reasons this is illegal is because artists release their music to get money off of it if u take their music for free right of the internet it's like stealing their music which is also like stealing money from record companies it is just as illegal to allow people to upload from you than it is to download from others you have become a file sharer and they take it just as seriously as file downloaders trust me i personally now know two people who were caught not on limewire but on imesh it is not worth it your whole life changes once you get sued you put yourself family at risk of paying thousands of dollars because of a few moments of weakness i gotta have that song i did it too my friends learned just how much they really needed all those songs once it happened the answer was they didn't need them at all your follow up question will i get caught is i'm sorry to say just a bit out of touch with what's going on out there people your new experts should not be the ones responding to this saying its legal but others who have gotten caught do some research on google with such words as music industry sues or lawsuit and see the world from the other perspective they are totally serious and totally committed to busting as many people as they can hope this helps someone out there go get some legal advice on this limewire is legal there was a recent court case betwenn the riaa and another p p file sharing client and the file sharing client won this is becuase the software is intended to help people distribute files and how can the people that have that software be held accountable for the others that use it illegaly if you share copyrighted metarial it is illegal if you share pics and documents which aren't copyrighted it is legal don't be fooled by the this product is legal that kazaa but on their website if you read it carefully it says that the downloading of the product is indeed legal and so is downloading music if its not copyrighted almost all music is copyrighted therefore downloading them is illegal this has been said above but here it is black and white clear as crystal copyright laws and laws pertaining to patents and inventions protect original works of authorship and inventions individuals who reproduce distribute copies receive copies publicly perform or display works or inventions other than their own and without the consent of the owners or holders of rights or their authorized agents in original works of authorship or inventions n m ay be in violation of copyright patent or other intellectual property infringement lime wire llc does not encourage or condone the illegal copying of copyrighted material this is not intended to be legal counsel or advice if you have any questions consult your attorney reference http www limewire com english content ftc shtml f anyone paying for legal file sharing sites have been fooled you could have stuck with any of the popular free sites and would be in the same boat regardless but with a little more money in your pocket no one has been caught or sued yet that has only downloaded music users uploading assuming larger quantities are the ones that have been fined granted it may happen where downloaders are caught but for now those who block all sharing along with turning off the function for the computer to be used as a supernode have a much better chance at avoiding trouble in a sense limewire is legal but in another sense it's illegal the fact right now is that limewire kazaa etc are legal because it is simply peer to peer file sharing like taking a cd to a friends house and letting him take the music on to his computer ripping this is legal in a sense so is limewire then because the music comes from an original cd that someone paid money to get and they are simply sharing it to selected people the problem that the recording companies and artists have is the mass file sharing meaning the sharing of the song to more than people in fact it's perfectly legal for anyone to share a file for free to or less people basically like burning a game or a cd and giving it to your girlfriend or something so is limewire legal yes but if they want to take a further step they might want to make a expiration system basically a program that automatically deletes songs off the online list after it's been downloaded times so there limewire is technically legal whenever you don't pay for some download with the exception of pc game demos the free download files are illegal limewire is a tool just like a knife tools have their roles in various tasks possessing the knife doesnt commit the crime its the person the used the knife that commits the crime one's focus should not be on the existence of limewire but on the particular wrong doing the happens with it is limewire illegal http wiki answers com q is limewire illegal  Computer virus AmigaOS Microsoft Office Google Desktop

is vista better than xp should i make the switch and why in my humble opinion no vista is not better than xp i think in maybe a year or so it will be as good as xp but it has a long way to go to be better than xp vista still has a lot of gliches than need to be sorted there is still very little software that is compatable with vista there is a lot of manufacturers who are reluctant to produce drivers for hardware for vista vista uses a lot of resources i would certainly say that you need a very bare minimum of gb of ram and a hard drive of at least gb this is just the bare minimum i have computers at home with vista premium not my choice and with xp there are adults who regularly use the computers they all want to use the xp basically because it is far simpler to use and far quicker need more convincing i attend an adult college the college has it suites a totally of computers because of general feed back from the public they have cancelled their vista upgrades my advice wait for at least a year and then see how things are take care and good luck  Windows Mobile Macromedia Flash Mouse (computing) Microsoft Office Windows XP Microsoft PowerPoint Stardock Digital photography Windows Vista Forth programming language Screenshot OpenOffice.org Yearbook Computer virus Apple II family IPod HyperCard Microsoft AmigaOS Minesweeper (computer game) Screenplay Windows 2000 Mozilla Firefox Pocket PC History of Microsoft Windows PlayStation Portable Microsoft Excel OpenBSD Opera (web browser) Science Macintosh Finder WordStar ZX Spectrum Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Educational animation Icon (computing) Atari ST Uploading and downloading Computer Melissa worm Peer-to-peer The Sims 2 ALGOL 68 Xerox Star Emacs Mac OS X v10.4 PlayStation 3 EIA-708 Knoppix Microsoft Word Floppy disk Xbox 360 Java programming language Gmail BASIC programming language Linux Apple Computer Computer forensics StarCraft Secret Missions Macintosh Plus Keynote (software) Apple IIGS IBM PC compatible Object Desktop Quest for Glory Objective-C Super Mario Bros. 3 GIF Dictionary Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Trusted computing Blue screen of death MS-DOS Kazaa Atari 8-bit family Google Desktop Baseball Stars Chrono Trigger Cache Nintendo Open access Oxford English Dictionary Software testing Super Nintendo Entertainment System Typeface XML E-mail spam Pump It Up GNU General Public License Signs Half-Life 2 Danger Hiptop Mac OS X Amiga Power Podcasting C programming language Public-key cryptography Commodore 64

how do you make sure you have deleted everything when you install downloaded programs i have a screensaver from the internet and when i did a system recovery it stopped working so i tried to reinstall and it wont let me so i tried uninstalling it and its not in my add program list i did a search for all it and found them what i want to know is it okay to delete them all so i can reinstall fresh first set a restore point name it something like screensaver problem so that you'll know what caused you to have to go through the following steps and that if all goes well you won't need to use that particular one again after you've manually found and deleted all files associated with that program look in my computer disk c programs then use the same route to get to the windows folder in there do the same while there go into the system folder in the system folder you must be very careful of what you delete because you could cause a crash by deleting the wrong thing but go in there and see if you find any files that go only to that program and delete them then use a registry cleaner to find the rest of the files to get rid of i use tweaknow regcleaner it's easy to use but does a good job get it here if you need it http www tweaknow com regcleaner html a follow up with ccleaner will finish the job if you need this get it here http www ccleaner com after you have your computer cleaned up including updating and running your av and other anti malware progs defrag then scandisk and then set a restore point again name it for what you've done like screen saver fixed computer clean this way you'll know that you can use this point in the future i hope this helps good luck  Windows XP Anti-virus software Computer virus Rootkit Kazaa Internet security Internet Explorer Microsoft Windows Computer security Trojan horse (computing) AOL Instant Messenger Stopping e-mail abuse Adware Mydoom Microsoft AntiSpyware Spybot - Search & Destroy Uninstaller Skype Windows registry LimeWire Dialer Peer-to-peer Domain Name System Instant messaging NX bit MSN OS/2 Spam (electronic) Windows 2000 Opera (web browser) Host file Windows Me Proxy server Computer surveillance Blue screen of death Filename extension Gmail E-mail spam MDAC Pop-up ad Microsoft Trusted computing Norton AntiVirus Windows Installer Linux Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Windows Vista History of Microsoft Windows New.net Windows Server 2003 Software bug Common criticisms of Microsoft Steam (content delivery) Zone Labs Component Object Model Extreme Programming Software cracking ITunes File sharing Yahoo!

is a cord needed to transfer pix from a cell phone yo a pc in many cases that will help but here is the evil part if you look at the website that your cellphone comes from let's say nokia you would look up your cell phone model number then look for the available accessories so then you pay the to get it but then you discover that your rat cell phone company encripts your phones on your cell phone so when you use this cable to transfer those photos it gives you a file that you can't open so check with your cell phone provider first you see they deliberately make it so you must send your photo via the cell phone to your regular e mail address that means that they earn every time you snap a shot if you find that your cell phone service charges you for your own photos drop them and go with a more friendly cell phone service you see it isn't the cell phone manufacture that is trying to beat the money out of you it's that darn cell phone service company good luck and happy computing  IP Multimedia Subsystem Proxy server Session Initiation Protocol Voice over IP Private branch exchange E-mail spam Internet Relay Chat Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Spyware Network address translation America Online Whois Gmail Search algorithm Cross site scripting Spam (electronic) The Internet Movie Database Bayesian inference Chernobyl accident Solar variation Electronic Numbering Internet censorship in mainland China Lightweight Directory Access Protocol Mozilla Application Suite Orkut Gopher protocol File Transfer Protocol Transformation problem Mozilla Firefox Stopping e-mail abuse Password SRV record Gaim Cantonese (linguistics) Firewall (networking) Jabber Search engine Plagiarism Representational State Transfer Etisalat Yahoo!

please help me fast problem with d link adapter i lost my cd for the d link adapter and i couldn't find it on the internet i have tried most of the software drivers websites but i couldn't find it on soft com driverfiles net driver com dlink com p d link dfe tx pci fast ethernet rev c there are steps to find download and install the d link adapter drivers identify model number look on the bottom of the adapter to find the exact model number of your product find driver go to www dlink com and click support downloads united states product information if your do not see your d link product then it is either no longer supported by d link or it is manufactured for distribution outside north america so you should call d link customer support at if your product is listed then download drivers click on your product and dowload the driver installation files save the installation files to a temporary directory on your hard driver read me before you install the drivers locate and review the read me file which will have supplemental information on installation instructions system requirements etc install drivers complete the installation process in the usual manner close all other programs run the installation setup exe program reboot your computer verify that the adapter works correctly it is generally a good idea not to use the cd that came with the d link because it will probably not be the most recent release with the most recent fixes instead one should always go to the manufacturer's website to search and download the correct drivers from major companies like d link this is safe and preferred good luck  Portable Document Format QuarkXPress Adobe Systems Adobe InDesign Adobe Acrobat Desktop publishing Adobe Illustrator Ebook Microsoft Publisher LaTeX Quark, Inc.

linux distributions i'm fairly new to linux and i've tried out a few different distros so far the best one i came across is ubuntu i've also tried slax dsl puppy linux and xubuntu is there anything out there better than ubuntu i want to pick a distro to dual boot with xp another distribution that caught my eye was linux xp has anyone used that and how compatible with windows programs is it thanks jtb but i have plenty of experience with dual booting well better tends to be highly subjective as most proponents of a distro will think their favorite distro is the best i prefer kubuntu personally it is based on ubuntu but has the kde desktop interface instead similar to the one slax has i prefer it mostly for its support and its interface i don't like gnome but other people choose other distros for different reasons don't get linuxxp unless you want to pay for it it requires a key code after boots and it is probably no more compatible with windows programs than any other linux distro using wine a windows compatibility layer you would mostly be buying it for its interface  WAV Musical Instrument Digital Interface Audio file format Marching band QuickTime Digital photography Slideshow MP3 Macromedia Flash Interchange File Format PlayStation Portable PNG SonicStage IPod ZIP (file format) PC Engine FL Studio Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Web page IPhoto NTFS ITunes Floppy disk MiniDisc Trombone PlayStation Sound Format Lossless data compression Bass guitar Slide guitar Image file formats Disk image JPEG Creative Zen Windows 2000 Movie projector Game Boy GIF Microsoft PowerPoint Cello Multitrack recording View camera Ebook Tar (file format) OSType Cascading Style Sheets Dither Computer forensics Trumpet File format Winning Streak Digital audio broadcasting Memory Stick HFS Plus Comparison of file systems Tracker TeX C programming language TrueType Podcasting Audio tape length and thickness Printf ILife Amstrad CPC International Phonetic Alphabet Advanced Encryption Standard File Allocation Table Portable Document Format AVI AmigaOS Unicode Telephone Windows Picture and Fax Viewer RSS (file format) MusikCube Warez Shogi Drum and bugle corps (classic) Saxophone BVE Compact disc Hierarchical File System Aspect ratio (image) Tablature Winamp MPEG-4 Gravis Ultrasound Module file Nine Inch Nails Ring tone Radio drama Universal Disk Format Cue sheet Windows 3.x Dd (Unix) Objective-C DVD

writing downloaded movies on dvd dear friends i have downloaded some movies torrents with the format dvd it usually opens into folders one is vedio ts and the other is audio ts the audio is empty but the vedio has so many vedio files and other files can you please tell me what is the best way to write it in a dvd r to make it look exactly like the original movie with full menues also how to write more than one movies on dvd if space permits i have seen some dvd are sold with full two three hour as much as movies in a single dvd nero has the facility for writing movies that work in stand alone players if you choose dvd media then dvd video that gives you the two folders you were speaking of open the red video ts folder and copy all the files from the downloaded video ts folder into it do not replace the red folder with the downloaded one don't know why but that doesn't work in terms of putting multiple films on disk you need to re author the dvd so that only the movie is burned onto the disk not the extras you then need to create a menu to select which movie you want to play i do something similar the programs i use are winavi to convert avi files the most common format used to download films to mpeg the format my authoring program uses tmpgenc dvd to re author the disk add tracks and create menu dvd shrink if the resulting dvd is too big this program reduces its size to fit on a dvd r you can make the video up to gig and shrink will make it fit larger to gig if you want but quality suffers nero burning rom to burn the resulting movie files to disk its not a quick process but its rewarding to see something you created playing on the tv if i can help further don't hesitate to contact me good luck my friend andy  Windows 2000 Object Desktop Macintosh Finder Library (computer science) History of the graphical user interface Google Desktop Windows Vista Uploading and downloading Mac OS X Windows registry Windows XP Computer virus Stardock Microsoft .NET Google KDE .NET assemblies ITunes System 7 (Macintosh) Ebook Cue sheet System 6 Microsoft Windows Filename extension Mod (computer gaming) Webmail Kazaa Lotus Notes Icon (computing) Blue screen of death File system GNOME MSN Messenger Linux Macromedia Flash LiveCD Opera (web browser) Common Unix Printing System ZIP (file format) Windows Mobile Graphical Environment Manager Bluetooth WebDAV OS/2 LiteStep Pretty Good Privacy Windows Me Web page Microsoft History of Microsoft Windows MegaMan Battle Network (video game) Trojan horse (computing) AmigaOS Danger Hiptop Desktop search PlayStation Portable Read-only memory Apple typography Asterisk Cmd.exe Operating system Spatial file manager Windows API MDAC Mach kernel Mac OS history OpenOffice.org Outlook Express Btrieve Microsoft Office Mozilla Firefox Gnutella Spotlight (software) Shell (computing) Mandriva Linux Musical Instrument Digital Interface Pipeline (Unix) Java programming language ILife Skype Konfabulator PHP Xerox Star Control Panel (Windows) Anti-virus software CPU design IBM PC compatible P__li Rootkit DesktopX Windows 95 Computer Dialer Symbian OS Windows Explorer Dynamic-Link Library Mac OS X v10.3 BitTorrent Screenshot Qt (toolkit)

windows vista i have windows xp and i was wondering if it is worth the money to upgrade to windows vista i hear from people that it is worth it but then i hear from professional editors that its not worth upgrading so anyone got any advice at this point in time no being that even as microsoft is fixing many bugs with vista my opinion is wait few more months until doing so or even a year why because vista has a large number of incompatibilities bugs security issues problems with it's own security blocking things you need or not blocking things you don't want vista sometimes hates something you install like your printer or your printer hates it also if you have a slow computer to run vista at an optimal level you'll need at least a dual core processor and gb of memory and hard drive space is a must probably about gb minimum that is only my suggestion xp professional would be a better choice at this time however it is hard to find in retail store being that microsoft is forcing the sale of vista from all retail stores and comp companies such as dell hp and compaq  Microsoft Office Microsoft Office Assistant Microsoft Windows Windows XP Microsoft Word History of Microsoft Windows Windows 95 Microsoft Excel SAS System File Allocation Table OS/2 X Window System Windows Mobile Microsoft Bob Mac OS X Visual Basic Computer virus IBM PC compatible X86 MSN Messenger WordPerfect History of the graphical user interface Windows API OpenOffice.org Apple Macintosh Emacs IPAQ Sun Microsystems Internet Explorer AppleWorks Internet Relay Chat MS-DOS Graphical user interface Windows 2.0 BASIC programming language Visual Basic .NET Component Object Model Windows 1.0 Quattro Pro Widget toolkit Windows 2000 Apple typography AOL Instant Messenger Microsoft Agent GNU Microsoft .NET Windows NT Web browser Alley Cat Stardock Puzzle Bobble 4 Aqua (GUI) Pocket PC Jam (TV series) Weebl and Bob How the Grinch Stole Christmas!

torrent how can i speed up my torrent downloads in azureus i have a mac cap your upload most important limit your upload speed to approximately percent of your maximum upload rate you can check your upload speed over here never trust your isp once you know your maximum upload speed change the max upload to speed in your torrent client s preferences don t get me wrong everyone should share as much as possible but if your upload rate reached it s max your download rate suffers significantly hack the max tcp connections if you re on xp sp your tcp connections are limited to a maximum of this seriously hurts your downloading speed because it wont let you connect to a high amount of ip numbers it is supposed to slow down viruses because their spreading strategy is to connect to a high amount of ip numbers but it also cripples your torrent downloads a nice way to fix this is to download this patch it allows you to set the maximum allowed connections to any number you want any number between and is ok more on this check seeds and peers a simple tip but o so important always look for torrents with the best seed peer ratio the more seeds compared to peers the better in general so seeds and peers is better than seeds and peers so be selective change the default port by default bittorrent uses a port bittorrent accounts for a lot of the total internet traffic so isp s like to limit the connection offered on the these ports so you should change these to another range good clients allow you to do this just choose anything you like if you re behind a router make sure you have the ports forwarded or upnp enabled disable windows firewall it sucks windows firewall hates p p and often leads a life of it s own so disable it and get yourself a decent firewall kerio or zone alarm for example last but not least buy a faster connection  BitTorrent The Internet Movie Database Wget Internet Abandonware Warez Copyleft Spyware Apache HTTP Server Video on demand World Wide Web CPAN Web crawler Virgin Mobile Something Awful MAME Windows XP Website DeviantART Uploading and downloading Internet fraud Single certification Thumbnail gallery post Linux MP3 Wireless Application Protocol Television movie Download.com Online music store Machinima PHP-Nuke Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Ultima Online Gmail Galactic Civilizations IP Multimedia Subsystem Google Linspire Opportunity cost Netscape Navigator Sunk cost HTTP cookie Streaming media Nintendo MP3.com Electronic commerce Radio drama QBasic The Sims Microeconomics Macromedia Flash Ajax (programming) Internet pornography Mozilla Firefox We Belong Together Fahrenheit 9/11 Superman III Minesweeper (computer game) Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Bbc.co.uk The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show Cross site scripting JSON Wiki RedHat Enterprise Linux clones Theory of conduct Guns N' Roses Moodle Micropayment Anonymous P2P Internet censorship in mainland China Commodore 64 Photo sharing Sid Meier's Alien Crossfire Perl Delta Goodrem ITunes Music Store Star Wreck Kazaa Uniform Resource Locator Batting average File Transfer Protocol Government debt Aladdin (1992 film) Free software Bulletin board system Download manager Xbox Live Atomic Kitten Care Bears Second Life Google Maps Representational State Transfer UK Singles Chart Anime The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Capitalism Record label

how do you open pst files when outlook won't let you i have a pst file which is a copy i had made from my previous job before i left it's password protected but i know the password obviously however when i try to open the file using outlook i get the message file access is denied you do not have the permission required to acess the file xxxx the system was win k and i did not have admin rights i have no business interest in reading the files the messages are all about years old but i would like to read some of the messages for sentimental reasons note that the file is encrypted so it can't be opened with something like wordpad for example any help would be appreciated thanks to mark f i am now able to open the file without the pesky no acces message however now i get there are no items to show in this view i did try the software reader that was suggested but that didn't help i know there's stuff in the file because it's mb any other ideas hooray i've opened the file successfully thanks everybody you've all been very helpful copying the file to my own machine solved part of the problem as i said in my last update importing sort of helped inasmuch as outlook didn't complain but said there was nothing to read then i renamed the file i was trying to import from outlook pst to test pst and imported that instead that was a bit of a pain itself because i had tried importing it and outlook wouldn't let go of it so i copied the original to another directory renamed it there then imported it hey presto i've got all my messages back i'm now torn for who to give the best answer accolade to it's a fight between ivan r and mark f i'm giving it to mark f because he was closer to the mark if you'll excuse the pun and he followed up too however if i could award it twice ivan r would get one too especially considering the amount of typing he did thanks again everyone i'm a very happy bunny this can happen if the mail file is on another machine on your network if this is the case then try copying it to your local c drive and opening it from there good luck updated ok at least you can now access the pst file you might have a version issue try running the inbox repair tool on it from the microsoft site to run the inbox repair tool follow these steps click start and then point to find or to search depending upon your operating system in the search for files or folders named box type scanpst exe double click the scanpst exe file to open the inbox repair tool type the path and the file name of the personal folders pst file or click browse to locate the file by using the windows file system click start if this still doesn't work then continue to post updates here there are more things to try  Delhi Khatushyamji Jaipur Singapore Changi Airport Agence m__tropolitaine de transport TransLink (Brisbane) Ravi Shastri Bharatiya Janata Party Rajput San Francisco Municipal Railway Bhuj London Buses Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) SmartRider Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority 21 July 2005 London bombings Rajasthan Indian nationality law London Underground Metcard Metro Transit (Minnesota) Narita International Airport Las Vegas, Nevada Allahabad Airline Manchester Metrolink Las Vegas Monorail Meenas Mahajanapadas Kiran Bedi Ranthambore New World First Bus Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport Caltrain Octopus card Bus MetroCard Ajmer Rajputana MTA New York City Transit buses Khotan Dublin My Mother the Carjacker Muni Metro Jean Charles de Menezes Public transport KCR Western Railway (India) Sisodia Bus stop Edwin Lutyens Newark Liberty International Airport Vadodara KCR Light Rail Jai Singh II Buses in London Aurangzeb Flag of India Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi Marwar Karisma Kapoor Rosa Parks Train station Bus rapid transit Air Deccan Jaisalmer March 2005 in India Indian Air Force Personal rapid transit Road transport Battle of Marston Moor Taxicab Coach Air Sahara Brahma RoadShow WheelTrans Marc Aurel Stein Hitchhiking Chicago Transit Authority United Kingdom general election, 2005 January 2005 in Britain and Ireland Final Fantasy IX Jack the Ripper Price discrimination Tabu (actress) Back to the Future Jodhpur K.

photoshop question how come i cant change the color of any thing from grey i pick a different color but it still shows up as grey it depends on how you turned the image into grayscale if its in grayscale mode it needs to be changed to rgb or cmyk etc this setting resides under image mode rgb if you added an adjustment layer on top of the layer you are trying to paint this would also have the same effect if you desaturate the image using ctrl shift u you should be able to use another color over it or on another layer if you prefer you also may have started a new document with grayscale selected instead of a color mode your problem could be a result of several things but i hope this helps  Adobe Photoshop Adobe Systems Adobe Illustrator Paint Shop Pro Adobe Acrobat GIMP Macintosh Finder IPhoto Microsoft Office GIF Adobe InDesign Tagged Image File Format Macromedia Fireworks Finale notation program Windows Vista Uploading and downloading 2D computer graphics Photoshopping Portable Document Format TeX Valve Hammer Editor Macromedia Flash Corel ImageMagick PNG Warez Object Desktop JavaScript Version Digital image editing Desktop publishing IPod Plugin Download manager Mac OS X ITunes Trademark Tux Paint Library (computer science) Windows registry Automator (software) System 7 (Macintosh) Fark.com Carbon (API) Cue sheet Favicon PlayStation Portable Bulletin board system IrfanView Secure copy Windows 2000 Ebook Encapsulated PostScript ILife Apple typography Stardock MIRC Weekly newspaper P__li Gnutella PostScript TrueType System 6 Brush Drawing Outlook Express WordPerfect Norton Commander Windows Me Spatial file manager Graphic design Multiple document interface Mod (computer gaming) Xerox Star Slash fiction Web page .NET assemblies Display PostScript Google Desktop ZIP (file format) Opera (web browser) OpenType Windows 3.x Computer virus Windows XP BitTorrent Bryce Avatar (virtual reality) RGB color model Directory Copyright infringement of software OpenDocument Raw image format Windows Explorer Lotus Notes Start Menu Transparency (computing) Gmail

excel function to find average of only the most recent 'x number' of entries i made a nice little spreadsheet to keep golf handicaps but i want to also make a handicap of my last and last rounds only obviously if i get better bad scores from some time ago will skew my handicap is there a way to only average the last x number in my case and then entries i keep dates with my scores so that could be used also or just the last i entered well that's definitely an idea however the layout and information on my spreadsheet would be much better suited to just have one box that always averages the last entries of that column i have different courses in different columns two subcolumns with date in one and score for that day in another at the bottom of each course column i have a handicap box averaging all scores from that column then under that i have an overall handicap box averaging all the scores together i was hoping to just add two more boxes in each course column to find my last and last handicaps it's really not that big of a deal i'm just playing with excel since i payed to get office so i'll enjoy playing with any help you give me oh also what is the for in the if function you gave me if d average d d is that just how you say if there is an entry then find the average of the last cells seems weird with the two sets of dude you rock i always figured i'm pretty good at excel but you got it down thanks alot and you are right different number of entries in each course column thanks for the help man i'm trying to enter the first function in the b column and i'm getting a value error the function is max if b b row b b scores start in b and will end at b although i only have scores through b as of now in this column also i kinda like to know what i'm doing so am i correct in that this just returns the row of the last entered score which will then later be used in the second function to average the last and last let's say you have a row for each round and your latest round is on row and you don't skip rows between rounds and let's say your scores are on column d you can add formulas in column e for the average of your last and in column f for your last in e average d d last in f average d d last you can copy these to lower rows and the row numbers will change to always refer to the last and last respectively you can even copy them far down the column so you don't have to add them later if you do that you will only want to calculate the average if a round score has been entered on that row so you would have in e if d average d d in f if d average d d if your setup is more complicated than i've assumed add detail or e mail edit i will need to take another look at how to do it with your additional info but the is two double quotes with nothing in between so essentially a blank so the formula says if d is blank no entry then display a blank otherwise calculate the average edit ok i'll assume your courses have varying numbers of scores filled in since you haven't played them all the same times assuming one of these course columns is column b somewhere in the column put this formula to find the last row that's filled in in that column assumes that scores start at row and that row is a blank row below all the scores max if b b row b b you could hide the row with this formula if you didn't want to see it i'm going to assume the above formula is at b this will be your formula to average the last average offset indirect b b this will be your formula to average the last average offset indirect b b repeat for the other columns replacing b in all three formulas if having trouble add detail again or e mail edit i knew i forgot something i just forgot to tell you that the formula that you're getting a value error on is an array formula which just means that you need to input it with ctrl shift enter rather just enter when you enter it with ctrl shift enter it will have curly brackets around the formula just fyi an array formula acts on a lot of cells at once in this case it's checking each row to see if it has an entry and if it does it gets its row number and at the end it finds the max row number and you're right on about what it's used for hope that fixes it for you  Peer-to-peer Azureus BitTorrent Computer virus Java programming language Ares Galaxy ITunes Macromedia Flash I2P Malware Eclipse (computing) Copyleft Spyware

hey please this is important how can i download a copy of microsoft home edition because my computer has a virus and the fucking anti virus won't delete it so i don't care if is a legal or a torrent please help then im going to have to unistalled it try these programs and let me know first and foremost these are my opinions and have experience several machines that had these on them as well as users using these product not to mention that i have ran each and every one of these myself so as to not confuse those that think that i have not my findings in these products are useless and sometimes scare the normal user also these products are not for the normal user as normal user do not take the time to read the manuals docs for what they download and or buy they just want to install and use stop using the following software avg avg has been known to report false positives also reports tracking cookies as trojan downloaders this is bad practice to me scaring the user half to death because that's all that we hear on the news anymore is about trojans worms and virus' maybe free but be aware that this product is not the normal product that you would put on a machine most if not all of your experts will tell you to leave this alone avoid it like the plaque ad aware se ad aware is a dangerous program if you do not know how to set it up although it comes with the basic 'normal'

help using rambooster v my friend recommended me with this program and i find it sort of hard to use even though the interface is so simple i want to know what is a good value to set the target level of free ram on top im using a dell with of ram thanks theoretically this program is completely unnecessary memory leak happens when a program stores something in ram doesn't use what it stored and doesn't free up the space either memory leaks typically only occur while the program is running when you close the program the operating system windows automatically claims back all of the ram that was used by that closed program a purported feature of ram booster if that were not the case that windows wasn't taking care of memory leaks you would have to reboot windows every time you opened more than applications because ram would be claimed by programs and windows wouldn't reclaim the ram when programs exited some ram boosters use virtual memory i e using part of the hard disk as ram but again windows takes care of virtual memory as long as you have plenty of hard drive space you can run a program that will completely max out your physical ram and windows will take care of optimizing virtual memory usage  Microsoft Excel Windows 2000 Lotus 1-2-3 Medical prescription Quattro Pro OpenDocument 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Lotus Improv Quicksort NTSC 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Standard deviation On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Garbage collection (computer science) Fast Fourier transform G__del's incompleteness theorem Prime number Volleyball PHP House of Leaves Subroutine Redundant array of independent disks Starfleet ranks and insignia Formula One XML Crossword Apollo Guidance Computer Billboard Hot 100 Geographic information system JavaScript Bowl Championship Series Ozone depletion Turing machine IP (complexity) Debugging United States House of Representatives John Lott Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Musical Instrument Digital Interface MDAC Artificial neural network Royal Assent Oscilloscope Batting average Extreme Programming Halting problem Biblical inerrancy Computer numbering formats Test plan Have I Got News For You Flat file database Collision detection Baseball Guitar C programming language Mach kernel Pointer Macintosh Finder Fernando Alonso Second language acquisition 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Quantification Rugby union positions Ozone hole Molecular evolution 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, exit polls Plame affair Wheel of Fortune Ontological argument Gross domestic product Michael Schumacher Control character Heinkel He 100 Indianapolis 500 Crystal Palace F.C.

microsoft word copy and paste okay i copied a very important document not in microsoft but elsewhere it was a couple of pages long and i can never get that back i copied it and it showed up in the copy tab on the right of the microsoft word document i then exited out of that and accidently deleted the microsoft document i need to get the copied part back but no matter how many times i try i can't find it on the copy tab on the right of a microsoft word document i want to know if it's possible to ever get that back please it's very important someone help me i don't want to have to be the person to tell you this but i'm sure others will if i don't i'm afraid that the clipboard is a temporary storage for holding information if microsoft word was closed and you've re opened it tried pasting ctrl v and it still doesn't appear i regret telling you that there is no way to recover that to my knowledge there is no log files of clipboard storage and the data is stored temporarily in the ram something which is unrecoverable once lost i know this answers your question and doesn't give you the hope you were looking for but at least you now spend your time re writing creating the information you lost rather than wasting time trying to recover it hope this helps  Windows 2000 Windows 3.x Beverly Hills, California Booting Computer virus Linux 64-bit Perl Virtual memory UK telephone numbering plan AmigaOS Windows Vista Mac OS X OpenGL Emacs Apple Macintosh History of Microsoft Windows DR-DOS Elevator File Allocation Table PHP Pump It Up Blue screen of death Knoppix Renting Library (computer science) Forth programming language Patch (computing) Windows Server 2003 Copyright infringement of software Component Object Model Unicode Telephone numbering plan German car number plates IBM PC compatible Terminate and Stay Resident Vertical service code Windows XP Apollo Guidance Computer Common Lisp Yu-Gi-Oh!

this is a biggie music is starting on desktop no program running virus maybe the last times i've started my computer music has begun playing that i did not put on it so far queen's flash gordon song with some conversation at the end something that sounded like sugar ray then a song that spewed countless obscenities for about minutes then the first part of some punk song that just stopped playing about seconds in i've had some computer problems here lately but this is just beyond me i think this is a virus but i'm not sure what to do about it i have put on virus protection and spyware blocker software but it hasn't resolved this issue to be fair it did remove a great deal of problems i just want to know if anyone is familiar with this problem and what to do about it if it goes deeper than some punk playing music on my desktop i want to know what to do thanks skyler i just restarted my computer and it didn't play the music so i'm going to assume it's an erratic virus that in mind any ideas on how to tackle it i've run virus scans and they haven't found it once again if anyone has ever heard anything about this virus i appreciate any input i can get this might be a joke program or a setting that someone changed on purpose if the music plays only when you start up the computer try going to the control panel then 'sounds speech and audio devices' then click on 'change the sound scheme' for win xp you will see a popup box with a list of 'program events' sounds scroll down until you see 'start windows' and 'windows logon' then select one at a time and click the 'play' button to see which one has the music then select whichever one and in the 'sounds' selection choose ' none ' this might solve the problem otherwise it's an active process virus  Streaming media Windows Media Video Warez Gmail World Wide Web Macromedia Flash Portable Document Format PlayStation Portable BitTorrent Wget Video codec Kazaa Microsoft ASCII art Common Unix Printing System Nine Inch Nails XML Wiki Website Mozilla Firefox Representational State Transfer Digital photography Web crawler HTML Mozilla Application Suite Karaoke Enterprise content management QuickTime Uniform Resource Locator Internet HyperText Transfer Protocol Web server E-mail Ebook Opera (web browser) Screenshot Online music store Digital rights management Source code Trusted computing Windows Vista We Belong Together Game show Domain Name System Xbox 360 Internet pornography MSN Messenger CPAN Windows XP Mac OS X v10.4 Laserdisc Richard Stallman AOL Instant Messenger VJ Uniform Resource Identifier Proxy server Podcasting Mac OS X Lotus Notes Anonymous remailer AmigaOS Phishing Google Web browser Commodore 64 Copyleft Slashdot subculture Usenet Xbox Wireless Application Protocol Spyware Secure Shell Ajax (programming) TLC Floppy disk MIME File Transfer Protocol LaTeX Theora Jennifer Lopez PlayStation 3 Ayumi Hamasaki DivX Comparison of media players IPod Filename extension OpenOffice.org MPlayer America Online Vlog Web page Blog Computer virus Super Audio CD ZX Spectrum Trillian (instant messenger) MP3 Nintendo GameCube

i would like to use excel to create address labels that can be printed on stickers how to do it avery j or similar paper usually this is done by creating a mailing list in excel and using word's mail merge feature to print the labels far too much to go through here so i'll just give a few tips for the most flexibility with the mail merge fields in word keep first and last names in separate cells ditto for the parts of the address street address city state zip word's mail merge can be found in the tools letters and mailings menu item before wasting pages of labels run tests on regular paper and hold the sheets up against the labels to check the layout don't leave the setting up to the last minute mail merge can be frustrating and take more time to set up than one would think for test runs use only enough names to be sure you're not losing any a little over a page should do skipping every other name is really easy to do keep a sense of humor while you're wrestling with it  CD recorder CD-R Greatest (Duran Duran) CD and DVD packaging Videocassette recorder DVD-RAM DVD Knoppix Laserdisc The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (film) Copy protection Jet engine Compact disc DeCSS Disk image HD DVD Digital rights management Online DVD rental Modchip Batman Forever Led Zeppelin (DVD) DVD plus RW The Ultimate Matrix Collection Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In DVD-R VHS Pok__mon Chronicles Single (music) Apollo 8 Nintendo Revolution Regional lockout Dallas (TV series) Unreal Tournament 2004 Sex Machineguns DVD region code Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events Sega Dreamcast Optical disc Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Blu-ray Disc Def Leppard H.264/MPEG-4 AVC DualDisc DVD recorder And All That Could Have Been The Adventures of Tintin (TV series) The Simpsons Laser Invader Zim Video CD Mudvayne Have I Got News For You Macrovision Pop Art: Pet Shop Boys - The Hits Scramjet Audio commentary (DVD) PlayStation 2 Calexico Citizen Kane Resident Evil: Apocalypse A-ha Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory Gold album Netflix Supagroup Ren and Stimpy CD-ROM Who Framed Roger Rabbit Dream Theater The Smashing Pumpkins Easter egg (virtual) DVD-Audio Quatermass II Comparison of media players Machine Head (band) DIVX Super Video CD M4 Sherman Oasis (band) Locations in the Warcraft Universe High-definition television Star Wars: Clone Wars Blank (cartridge) Pioneer Corporation Refused String Cheese Incident USS Brill (SS-330) ITunes Why Do You Love Me R30 Live In Frankfurt Solid rocket Enhanced Versatile Disc MP3 Modesty Blaise Mary Poppins Rammstein Shakespear's Sister Dolby Digital Lamb of God (band) The O.C.

why does my windows xp system automatically shut down every t minutes i have a gateway system with windows xp pro on it every three to five minutes the system automatically shuts off and will not turn back on for about another three minutes during the time that the system is shut down the green power light is still on but when i press the power button nothing happens as soon as the green power light goes off i can hit the power button and the system will boot back up for about another to minutes i have checked the power setttings and everything seems to be correct i set the hard disk to go off never but this problem still occurs i ran a norton virus scan and windows defender scan and came up with nothing interestingly enough the system did not shut off during the time that the scans were running i plugged the power supply into another system and the system stayed on with no problems the power light staying on is interesting to me any help would be greatly appreciated from your description it's probably safe to say your problem has nothing to do with win xp is your computer's clock keeping proper time if not then check the cmos battery looks like a giant watch battery on your motherboard a computer acts really wonky when that battery starts dying try disconnecting everything hard drive included and see if it'll boot through and stay on longer than the minutes leave only the keyboard connected disconnect the monitor hard drives cd dvd drives and anything else you mentioned about the power light staying on disconnect the led cord for this as well this will help you eliminate what is causing the problem also is it that your hard drive shuts off before the rest of the computer or that your computer shuts off and then dials down the hard drive i think another person's suggestion about the heat lvls is possible as well have you checked the resting temp in the bios if you've tried the elimination and it still turns off with absolutely nothing connected by the power supply keyboard then i think it's safe to say it's likely something with the chip motherboard whether it's heat related cmos battery you can try replacing this since those batteries are pretty cheap etc good luck with this  Microsoft Windows Windows Vista Windows XP IBM PC compatible Mac OS X ATI Technologies History of Microsoft Windows Mouse (computing) Apple Macintosh MSN Messenger DirectX Windows Server 2003 IPod OpenGL Radeon Bluetooth AmigaOS Personal computer Xbox Windows 3.x Microsoft PowerPC Microsoft Office Webcam Laptop X Window System Nintendo Linux Amiga OS/2 History of the graphical user interface PlayStation 2 Best Buy NVIDIA Apple Computer Wintel Windows Me Blue screen of death NX bit Universal Serial Bus MS-DOS Graphics card Video Graphics Array Architecture of Windows 2000 Timeline of computing 1990-forward DOS Windows Presentation Foundation Bill Gates Wi-Fi Windows API Vaporware Xbox Live IMac Apple IIGS PowerBook PlayStation 3 Computer hardware Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Hard disk DR-DOS Palm OS Internet fraud System/360 Portable Document Format Patch (computing) Electronic commerce Mac OS X v10.4 Skype TRS-80 Color Computer Poker jargon Sega TRS-80 Next-Generation Secure Computing Base 64-bit CP/M Prank flash Macromedia Flash Fritz-chip The Walt Disney Company Connectix Spyware USB flash drive LiveCD Internet Explorer ALGOL 68 Windows Blackcomb Teletext Device driver Knoppix Amstrad CPC Software cracking Desktop computer Atari ST MDAC Computer-aided design ReactOS Microprocessor Kernel (computer science)

does anyone have the full version of adobe acrobat who can modify one or two of my forms does anyone have the full version of adobe acrobat who can modify one or two of my forms i have some application forms in pdf format that need a few more fields pre printed on them and some of the fields changed it would only take a few minutes to do that and i really don't need the full version for such very limited use i would have no ongoing use for the full program i did have a full but trial version of adobe acrobat that i downloaded from their website for a couple weeks and i found it very user unfriendly even though i'm a bit of a computer geek myself so i decided that it was definitely not a good idea to buy it it would take too much of a learning curve for me to master an application that should only take me about or minutes to modify a few existing forms i could e mail you the pdf files and then they could be modified and sent back to me if you help me whatever you need in some similar area i could certainly return the favor john v i'll help subanen yahoo com  Windows 2000 Booting Windows XP AmigaOS Blue screen of death Partition (computing) Microsoft Windows Computer virus Emacs Mouse (computing) NX bit IA-32 Object Desktop Sega Dreamcast Windows Vista History of Microsoft Windows NTFS IPod Windows 3.x IBM PC compatible Btrieve Mozilla Firefox Screenshot Windows Installer System 7 (Macintosh) File Allocation Table USB flash drive Windows 95 Virtual memory System/36 GRand Unified Bootloader MDAC Redundant array of independent disks File system Dual boot Embedded system Oscilloscope Commodore 64 BIOS Windows Me Stardock System/34 FreeDOS Amstrad CPC Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Hard disk Atari 8-bit family Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Macromedia Flash Windows Server 2003 Backup Floppy disk PDP-11 Wine (software) Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Library (computer science) Opera (web browser) Terminate and Stay Resident Architecture of Windows 2000 Super Mario Bros.

is there a way to rearrange the order of posted tracks in the itunes library without altering the song titles for example say i put an album into the itunes music library but the tracks came out in the wrong order one way of rearranging the order of tracks is by changing the name of the song so if a song that came first in the track order is actually fourth on the list you could place a number preceding the song title so that it would be first on the list usually this works but not always so all im asking is there another way to rearrange the tracks in the order you want them in click on the song then click file get info or ctrl i under the info tab there is a place to type in the song number put in click next put in click next etc  E-mail Stopping e-mail abuse E-mail spam Gmail Anonymous remailer Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Pretty Good Privacy Computer forensics Spam (electronic) United States Postal Service HTML Spam Prevention Early Warning System SpamAssassin Bayesian filtering Opera (web browser) Usenet Viral marketing Yahoo!

whats the difference between windows vista and windows vista upgrade ok i looked at vista boxes and i saw different windows vista ultimate i saw windows vista ultimate cost around and windows vista upgrade cost what the hell is the difference hey joao chris a windows vista ultimate upgrade is the cheaper edition of vista for good reason the upgrade edition allows you to upgrade your exiting operating system like windows xp pro or home to windows vista whilst keeping your existing files and settings basically the upgrade edition is cheaper because microsoft has chosen to charge less if you are already using their software the idea is that vista upgrade edition will only let you 'upgrade' your current software to vista and not do a 'clean install' windows vista ultimate complete edition typically comes with new pc's and allows people to 'clean install' vista should they need to the complete edition can also be used to 'upgrade' an existing operating system basically ultimate upgrade can upgrade your existing software whilst ultimate 'complete edition' can upgrade and clean install hope this helps regards richo ideastorm  Portable Document Format Adobe Acrobat Adobe Systems Ebook Windows Vista Warez Adobe Illustrator Macromedia Flash PostScript Opera (web browser) Mac OS X Common Unix Printing System Microsoft Office OpenDocument LaTeX TeX Gmail WordStar WordPerfect Computer virus Unicode World Wide Web PNG Debian Windows 3.x Digital rights management Kazaa Digital photography ITunes QuickDraw GX MDAC Mac OS X v10.4 Emacs Windows 2000 Typeface Microsoft Windows Perl Open-source software Visual Basic Domain Name System Copyleft First-sale doctrine Rootkit JavaScript Display PostScript PHP FreeBSD MP3 Debugging Adobe InDesign Podcasting Killian documents HyperCard Spyware Linux Forth programming language Filename extension GIF SAS System XML Lisp programming language BASIC programming language Lotus Notes Computer IPod Windows XP AmigaOS Linspire BitTorrent Trademark IPhoto Musical Instrument Digital Interface Encapsulated PostScript Python programming language Comparison of web browsers Mach kernel Microsoft 2D computer graphics Plan 9 (operating system) Palm OS Pump It Up Apple Macintosh Scalable Vector Graphics Enterprise content management Translation memory ALGOL 68 Patch (computing) Copyright infringement of software Trusted computing QuarkXPress C programming language MSN Messenger E-mail NX bit EMule United Kingdom corporation tax Postcode

can i get yahoo mail updatets through windows live messenger i use windows live messenger the latest version but i use a btinternet co uk email adress for my login email for my live messenger account is it possible that when i get a new email sent to my btinternet co uk account that i can get a pop up in live messenger the same way i would if i was using a hotmail co uk address hope that makes sense yes you can you need to go in to your yahoo mail prefrences and find the pop access this will enable all messages to be forwarded to any email address of your choice that means that you only need to log in to the hotmail to read all your messages there's no need to log into the yahoo each time you get a new message in your hotmail messenger will alert you straight away email me if you need help go to my profile and use the facility there it works believe me thats what i'm doing i've had my yahoo mail address for years but most of my friends use windows live messenger as opposed to yahoo instant messanger  Spyware Windows XP Mac OS X Macromedia Flash Windows Vista Macintosh Finder Object Desktop IBM PC compatible Blue screen of death File system Microsoft Windows Gmail MDAC Linux Windows Me Windows 2000 Google Desktop Konqueror History of Microsoft Windows ITunes Btrieve IPod Computer virus Windows Mobile History of the graphical user interface Stardock Mouse (computing) Apple Macintosh Windows Server 2003 NTFS Computer forensics Library (computer science) Control Panel (Windows) SAS System Java programming language File Allocation Table Malware Windows Installer Internet Explorer Outlook Express USB flash drive Apple Open Collaboration Environment System 6 OpenGL Windows API Patch (computing) Minesweeper (computer game) Host file Linspire New.net Windows registry Kazaa NTFS junction point Anti-virus software Mozilla Firefox ZIP (file format) MSN Messenger Perl Mac OS X v10.4 Hello world program Comparison of file systems Common Unix Printing System AmigaOS NeXT Windows Explorer GNOME Windows 3.x The Sims 2 Universal Serial Bus OpenOffice.org WindowBlinds P__li QuickTime Virtual memory ICalendar Visual Basic .NET Mozilla Application Suite NaturallySpeaking Microsoft Office PHP OS/2 AOL Instant Messenger C programming language WordPerfect Stopping e-mail abuse Disk cloning FreeDOS Enterprise content management Computer Xcode File format Start Menu Opera (web browser) Rootkit Filename extension Common criticisms of Microsoft Python programming language MSH (shell) System 7 (Macintosh)

there is an itunes download if i download this will i lose all my songs no it will not cause you to lose all your songs but be aware if you do not keep a backup copy of your music you probably will lose all your music within years this is because sooner or later your hard drive will crash someone will a accidentally erase the files a virus or other problem will prevent you from booting and require you to format and reinstall without the option to backup your files backing up your files to an external drive is an improvement but you still run the risk of a virus infecting all the drives connected to the computer also external drives appear to have a much higher failure rate than internal drives the best solution for safety is to back up to cd dvd disks some estimates for cd dvd life go from to years for storing on a cd dvd i recommend you use a quality brand i like verbatin best then hp and tdk do no use rewritable disks rw or dual layer dl their life is much less rewritable disks are affected by light so they also have a limited number of reads a number that s still uncertain handle the cd dvd as little as possible and only by outer edge or center hole verify that the data has been transferred to the disk and is readable make a second backup copy place each cd in a case store disks vertically store in a dark area avoid extremes in temperature and humidity dvd r is superior to dvd r care and handling of cds and dvds a guide for librarians and archivists http www foray com cdanddvdcareandhandlingguide pdf do handle discs by the outer edge or the center hole use a non solvent based felt tip permanent marker to mark the label side of the disc keep dirt or other foreign matter from the disc store discs upright book style in plastic cases specified for cds and dvds return discs to storage cases immediately after use leave discs in their packaging or cases to minimize the effects of environmental changes open a recordable disc package only when you are ready to record data on that disc store discs in a cool dry dark environment in which the air is clean remove dirt foreign material fingerprints smudges and liquids by wiping with a clean cotton fabric in a straight line from the center of the disc toward the outer edge use cd dvd cleaning detergent isopropyl alcohol or methanol to remove stubborn dirt or material check the disc surface before recording do not touch the surface of the disc bend the disc use adhesive labels store discs horizontally for a long time years open a recordable optical disc package if you are not ready to record expose discs to extreme heat or high humidity expose discs to extremely rapid temperature or humidity changes expose recordable discs to prolonged sunlight or other sources of ultraviolet light write or mark in the data area of the disc the area the laser reads clean by wiping in a direction going around the disc for cds especially do not scratch the label side of the disc use a pen pencil or fine tip marker to write on the disc write on the disc with markers that contain solvents try to peel off or reposition a label among the digital media prerecorded and write once optical discs are more stable than digital magnetic tape neither optical discs nor magnetic tape however is as stable as microfilm or paper with proper care microfilm and non acidic paper can last for centuries while magnetic tape lasts only a few decades van bogart just as film types can vary in years of usefulness one disc type can also last longer than another temperature and humidity conditions can markedly affect the useful life of a disc extreme environmental factors can render discs useless in as little as a few days per http www gcn com print html topic news general industry guidelines now estimate office burned copies of cds and dvds could remain readable for to years most industry estimates place the life span of professionally produced optical disks somewhere between and years but the weakness of the rom disks stems largely from their aluminum reflective layer byers said rewritable cds and dvds have a shorter life span of about years so byers said he does not recommend them for archiving a rewritable disk s metal alloy data layer is less stable than that in write once disks and rewritable disks are affected by light so they also have a limited number of reads a number that s still

get some memory hi im not the best person on pc s and i need a little help a lot of my memory has been taken up on my pc can anyone tell me how i can get some of my memory back maybe by deleteing some stuff what uses most memory and is there anything i can do or get to help with this problem not sure what i can delete or not ie is it music and stuff like that or is it just software or both or something else any help please thank you do you mean memory or hard disk space the easiest way to differentiate is to think of the hard drive as the filing cabinet everything stays in there even when the computer is switched off memory is the stuff your computer uses when it's switch on and needs to access things quickly a bit like the stuff you keep on your desk while your working on particular projects memory clears when the pc is switched off like you clear your desk at the end of your working day if it's hard disk space then yeah deleting temporary internet files etc will free some space also uninstalling programs you no longer need using control panel add remove programs will also free up some more if you mean memory then you need to look at how many things are running on your computer at any one time i'm guilty of running lots at once eg word excel explorer firefox azureus and a few other programs every open program uses a bit or a lot or ram memory closing some of these programs will free up more ram or desk space and help your computer run a bit smoother if that doesn't do enough you may need to get a techie friend to come round and look at what is loading when the computer starts up i find the offer of beer cake or even lunch is enough to tempt most techies if your computer has mb of ram or less it may be worth upgrading a little too http www crucial com have a program that can determine what ram you need you'll need to grab that techie friend to install it or you could try going to your local pc superstore who'll do the lot although it'll cost you more than a cake  Macintosh Finder Windows 2000 Windows registry Blue screen of death Windows 3.x File system Windows XP ITunes Control Panel (Windows) Mouse (computing) System 6 Object Desktop File Allocation Table Mac OS X MegaMan Battle Network System 7 (Macintosh) Booting Spyware COMMAND.COM Windows Explorer Btrieve Emacs MegaMan Battle Network (video game) NTFS junction point Gmail Hello world program MegaMan Battle Network 3 Windows Me History of the graphical user interface Microsoft Windows Library (computer science) NTFS Konqueror MSN Messenger IPod Cmd.exe Windows Vista Trojan horse (computing) Mozilla Firefox Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME AmigaOS Macromedia Flash Apple typography Mac OS history Common Unix Printing System Taskbar Klondike (solitaire) Start Menu MegaMan Battle Network 2 Host file Stardock Windows Server 2003 Computer virus Google Desktop Path (computing) Windows 1.0 Linux LiveCD Card game Commodore 64 Directory ILife SpamAssassin MDAC PHP Knoppix Filename extension Xbox 360 SQL Virtual memory Partition (computing) Computer and video games Windows API AOL Instant Messenger Xerox Star Job Control Language Data General Nova Pretty Good Privacy Embedded system Dialer Screensaver .NET assemblies Dance Dance Revolution Game controller The Sims 2 Mahjong solitaire Control-Alt-Delete OpenOffice.org Python programming language Universal Serial Bus Spirit rover NX bit B-47 Stratojet MegaMan Battle Network 5 Dynamic-Link Library Apple PlainTalk Windows Mobile Pipeline (Unix) Anti-virus software Uninstaller

google sketch up how do you make the letter s first go to camera standard views top then i would start by drawing a straight line where the s starts you could also start with a semi circle using the arc tool also from there i would make curved lines using the arc tool extending from the first straight line or curved line if the curve is a bit out of shape just delete that line and make another one from there proceed to make small portions of the curves in the shape shape desired i suggest doing sections at a time as opposed to doing one whole side then curving around to the other but whatever you prefer should be fine here is what i made using the technique that i badly described http img imageshack us img screenshot uk png time approx min  Machinima Computer and video games DVD Yu-Gi-Oh!

how to make transparent image color using photoshop i have made a rectangular shape i want to fill the color with blue how do i make the color so that it becomes transparent the reason is because i want to use the object as a highlighted menu in mobile phones i want to use it in theme studio so that when it highlights a menu the background can still be seen but not clear its kind of like misty can someone help i'm using photoshop cs hi there are a few important pieces of information missing from your question such as which version of photoshop you are using and what file format you want i'll provide two ways of doing this hopefully one will suit your purpose method create a new rgb image go to your layers lists and double click on the default background layer and click ok this will turn it into a regular layer choose select all from the menu and press delete the layer should now be a checkerboard pattern indicating that it's entirely transparent draw something on the layer then go back to the layer panel and lower the opacity save this as either a png or bmp and test method create a normal rgb image paint your image and select it go to the channels tab and click on the save selection as channel button at the bottom this will convert your selection to a black and white alpha channel with the name alpha select the alpha channel and then select adjust brightness contrast from the menu play with the settings so that the alpha channel is black and grey instead of black and white the intensity represents transparency try saving this out again as both png and bmp when saving bmps make sure you check the bit option so that alpha information is included older versions of photoshop don't support bit bmps good luck  File system Macintosh Finder File Allocation Table PlayStation Portable Windows 2000 Disk image Universal Media Disc Mod (computer gaming) Partition (computing) Windows XP System 7 (Macintosh) Apple typography NTFS Object Desktop Mac OS X AmigaOS International Organization for Standardization Linux Launchd Windows Explorer Mouse (computing) Computer Embedded system Windows Vista System/36 Stardock Icon (computing) Acorn Electron Mac OS X v10.4 Regional lockout LiveCD Windows registry OS/2 Directory File format IPod Common Unix Printing System Read-only memory History of the graphical user interface Enterprise content management Macromedia Flash Gmail Quotation mark System 6 Debugging DVD ITunes Uploading and downloading Unicode Getting Things Done Plan 9 (operating system) Nintendo GameCube Berkeley Software Distribution Copy protection PNG Xerox Star Portable Document Format Advanced Audio Coding ISO image Redundant array of independent disks Lotus Notes C plus plus Software testing GBA Movie Player QuickTime ZIP (file format) Hello world program C programming language Modchip MSX Commodore 64 BIOS Digital Equipment Corporation USB flash drive OpenBSD Screenshot PlayStation 3 Master Control Program XML Virtual memory Apple Macintosh Product Lifecycle Management Konqueror MS-DOS Klik Double Dare Digital photography Geographic information system MegaMan Battle Network (video game) Computer hardware Musical Instrument Digital Interface Palm OS Computer forensics BASIC programming language Cyberspace Patch (computing) Spatial file manager .NET assemblies Easter egg (virtual) Mach kernel

mac os x server can't find serial number i just received a g desktop with os x server installed i wanted to add another admin account so i booted in apple s to get command line where i proceeded to erase the applesetupdone file when the computer rebooted it opened the setup assistant which i wanted but it asked for the serial number which i can't find i have all the install discs and the documentation but i don't know where the serial number is any ideas on what to do is there possibly a way to get back to the other admin account on the system i have the username and password for it i solved it i had been at a stage where i wasn't able to boot without going straight to setup so i couldn't start up mac os what i did was reboot into apple s mode command line and open a text editor pico then i rewrote by hand the entire contents of applesetupdone i did this by opening the file on another computer and reading it there i rebooted and all was well thanks for your help not the first dude though he clearly doesn't understand that it's the pc users who are making the mistake click on the apple icon in the menu bar choose about this mac then click on more info on the left you will see hardware click to select that and on the right you will see serial number after you finish the setup program by creating a new admin account you can logout of that and login to your original user in some versions of os x the old user will be changed to a disk image file and placed in a folder called deleted users in that case use the accounts pane in system preferences to create a new admin user with exactly the same short name as the deleted user after that you can mount the disk image and copy files from it to the new user  IChat Mac OS X AOL Instant Messenger ICQ Mac OS X v10.4 MSN Messenger Session Initiation Protocol Apple Macintosh QuickTime IPod Mac OS X v10.2 Apple Computer Comparison of instant messengers Bonjour (protocol) ISight Windows Vista Microsoft Office Mac OS X v10.3 Macromedia Flash Internet Relay Chat System 7 (Macintosh) User agent X Window System Mac OS history History of Microsoft Windows IMac ITunes Google Talk IBM PC compatible Opera (web browser) Delphi programming language WordPerfect Mac OS Microsoft Windows Unicode Commodore 64 Windows Server 2003 Logic Pro Timeline of computing 1990-forward LaTeX Peer-to-peer HyperCard QuarkXPress Internet Explorer OpenOffice.org Vorbis Windows XP PowerPC Classic (Mac OS X) PowerBook Mozilla Firefox Mac mini Radeon H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Power Macintosh G3 PHP Mac OS 9 FileMaker TRS-80 Microsoft Trillian (instant messenger) Carbon (API) Internet Explorer for Mac Final Cut Pro Screenshot Address Book (software) Nintendo DS Linux Mouse (computing) Microsoft Word Common Unix Printing System Amiga Common User Access Windows Media Video High-definition television Python programming language Windows 3.x Mac OS X Server Microsoft Messenger for Mac Mac OS 8 Freenet Perl Apple II family MS-DOS WebObjects AppleScript Microsoft Virtual PC Online music store History of the graphical user interface Yahoo!

what program will streamline the process of scanning several pages into a single file and is preferably free i run windows xp and use microsoft office vista before the upgrade to office vista ms's document imager would allow me to scan files into one tif document now with the upgrade none of my ms programs will let me scan directly into a document not even into an outlook email they've caused me to have to open up a photo imaging program to scan with and it's added a good extra minutes to tasks at least it feels that way is there an open source program that can help me does open office allow scanning directly into one of their documents and any ideas as to why ms got rid of this functionality to its office programs to make you buy another program or to appease some drm idiocy any advice will be well appreciated from this frustrated office worker that's great to hear about open office and yes the image would be inserted at the cursor as for the ms document scanner it used to allow you to put the scanned documents in any order you wished although it saved it as a huge tif file i always produced a smaller pdf file using the open source pdf creator just go to the print menu in any program and produce the pdf great freebie for any pc i'll leave this question up for awhile to see if there's any more answers thanks all i'm not sure if i'm on the right track it would be very difficult to scan several pages into a single document because the document would need to know how to place them if you had such a program in the past i'm actually surprised i don't use open office but it's on my computer a quick check revealed that in the insert menu there is provision to scan pictures directly into the page you just set up your twain device scanner then scan the pic once the first picture is inserted and that would be at the cursor position i guess you can then scan the second third etc this is the best you're going to get open office can also convert your file to a pdf for emailing you must be very careful about using tiff's they are huge files by any standard photos will be up to ten times larger than a jpg maybe more i've got some tutorials on my site that may be of some help one is sending attachments by email the other is cropping photos to save space my next tutorial due in a few days is making photos smaller kb for emails and web pages i'd love to have you as a visitor because the tutorials are really worth their weight in gold all the programs i use are free and i tell you where to get them and how to install them it's just a temporary site at present but there's plenty of stuff there despite it being only a couple of weeks old http www yacht valhalla com answers hope to see you there my email address is at the bottom of every page and you're welcome to contact me  Modem BitTorrent Sound card Windows 2000 MDAC DeviantART Mozilla Firefox Copyleft Dave Matthews Band Open access Mac OS X MySQL Bluetooth Steam (content delivery) Weezer Digital audio player Radeon Wine (software) Copyright Online music store Windows XP Human resources IPod Opera (web browser) Sound Blaster Railway signal Evanescence Creative Zen Trillian (instant messenger) EMule SAT Blue screen of death Creation (theology) Swing (genre) SmartRider A Course In Miracles Video game music Odyssey of the Mind Wikipedia The Star Wars Holiday Special C programming language Ada programming language Prostate cancer Creativity Jeremiah Duggan Film Perl Halo 2 Overhead lines Object Desktop Computer virus SoundStorm Debugging Windows Update Almost complex manifold Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire Archimedes Metcard Bradley Nowell Driver's license Anthroposophy Something Awful Forums Asset Microsoft .NET Adobe Acrobat PHP Creation science Sample chess game Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold History of Microsoft Windows 64-bit Internet Explorer Entrepreneurship Outsourcing 2005 United States Grand Prix Creative Nomad Super Nintendo Entertainment System Dream Theater Jewish Task Force Attack of the Show!

my computer is slow i already ran a virus scan antispyware registry cleaner and everything is allright i do not have that many files or music and my computer is relatively new everytime i start a program such as word or excel or internet explorer it takes a long time to start but once i start using the programs they work perfectly the problem is the time it takes for them to start how can i fix this without reformating my computer ps i already defragmented the drive this could be because you have many 'left overs' from other programs that is causing your computer to go slow or could be windows updates because i hear they also cause your computer to slow down 'left overs' are files or programs that are left in your computer even though the original program that uses those files is already removed they might be there to retain compatibility or to prevent errors in the computer run chkdsk to see if there is any problem with your harddrive or errors in the file system  Object Desktop Mozilla Application Suite Windows XP Internet Explorer Component Object Model Comparison of web browsers NPAPI Macromedia Flash Dialer Windows 2000 IPod HTTP cookie Mouse (computing) Browser Helper Object Browser wars Microsoft Windows Gmail Microsoft Last.fm Minesweeper (computer game) Rootkit Ajax (programming) Microsoft .NET Halo: Combat Evolved Winamp ITunes DesktopX Stardock Wiki Avant Browser Stopping e-mail abuse Traffic light Internet Explorer for Mac Kazaa Digital rights management P__li Java programming language System 7 (Macintosh) Netscape Browser Xbox 360 Google Desktop ADO Control Panel (Windows) AmigaOS E-mail NTFS Guitar Windows Explorer Trillian (instant messenger) Microsoft Paint Opera (web browser) MDAC Konqueror Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Fire alarm control panel Nintendo Revolution Amazon.com BlackBerry Common Unix Printing System OpenBSD Digital audio workstation Expos__ (Mac OS X) Screenshot Microsoft AntiSpyware Twm MSN Messenger Thumbnail gallery post Combo box Blue screen of death Uploading and downloading Mandriva Linux Steam (content delivery) Windows API Pretty Good Privacy Tab (GUI) MAME Computer security Option key Vertical service code Outlook Express Multimedia Fusion NetCaptor Need for Speed VBulletin Jumpstart 3rd Grade Information Technology Infrastructure Library Windows Vista Cheating in Counter-Strike Password Apple Open Collaboration Environment Palm OS Gecko (layout engine) Internet fraud Warcraft III Information Services Procurement Library International Phonetic Alphabet Prank flash

microsoft access help i have tables which have some overlapping data i want to merge the tables into one and delete anything that overlaps i don't want to just remove the duplicates i need to delete all of the items which exist in both tables because it is superfluous does anyone know how to do that i think it's called an append and delete query but i can't figure it out and i'm afraid of messing up the data thanks i created an example for the steps i provided below click the following link http briefcase yahoo com rodrunner sbcglobal net to download the database the database is located inside the public folder once you downloaded the database read the instructions and examine the database create a backup of the two tables to do this follow these steps a select one of the tables then press ctrl c on you keyboard b now press ctrl v c access will ask what type of table you would like to paste choose structure and data d type the name for your new table and click ok this will be your backup table e perform steps a to d for the other table now that you have backup the data you can create a master table this master table will hold the data for the two tables to create a master table you can either do it by using design view or use a make table query make sure when you design the master table you insert a primary key set this primary key to contain text data type and also allow no duplicates now create an append query for the first table and append the data to the master table once you appended the data perform the same routine for the second table note use a concatenation method to generate a primary key for each record you are appending to do this create an expression that looks like the following unqid field field field this will allow you to generate a unique id for each record thus eliminating duplicates you should now have a master table containing both tables' data if this is too confusing you can email me and i'll be more than happy to assist you  Peer-to-peer File sharing LimeWire Warez BitTorrent Copyright infringement of software ITunes Music Store Napster Copyright infringement Jon Lech Johansen Copyright GNU General Public License MGM Studios, Inc. v.

excel formulas okay here's the situation i have a spreadsheet that i am creating and i've hit a wall it has basically four pages the first three are 'year one' 'year two' 'year three' the last is 'totals' what the user is doing is selecting courses for weblearning that they've completed on the first three pages the user has a cell a with a drop down box referencing all of their class choices the user can then go back the next time they complete a webcourse and in cell a add the next one they've completed and so on how do i get the classes to show up on the totals page once they've been selected what i need is the 'total' page to show a list of all courses chosen over all three years maybe not the most elegant but i think the easiest way to do this assuming there is a maximum number of courses in a year say is to bring in all of the cells that may have course selections and then filter out the blanks bring over all the course selections if 'year one' a 'year one' a if 'year one' a 'year one' a etc if 'year one' a 'year one' a if 'year two' a 'year two' a if 'year two' a 'year two' a etc if 'year two' a 'year two' a if 'year three' a 'year three' a if 'year three' a 'year three' a etc if 'year three' a 'year three' a in the same way you can also bring over any other course information course type hours etc from the other columns hide the blank ones put a filter on that column data filter autofilter select nonblanks i hope this helps good luck  PlayStation 2 Windows XP DVD Xbox Modchip USB flash drive PlayStation Portable Atari 8-bit family Sega Dreamcast Commodore 64 Apple Macintosh IBM PC compatible Xbox 360 Nintendo GameCube Nintendo 64 Sound Blaster IPod Floppy disk Knoppix Timeline of computing 1990-forward Warez GNU General Public License Atari ST Regional lockout Nintendo Revolution Apple Computer DVD-RAM PlayStation 3 Computer software Copy protection TiVo Sega Saturn ZX Spectrum Craps ITunes Digital rights management A600 Computer and video games Linux Nero Digital IMac Library (computer science) Microeconomics Microsoft Office MMORPG Digital video recorder AmigaOS DR-DOS Screenshot PC Engine Digital photography Sharp Zaurus CPU design NeXT First-sale doctrine Apple II family Amstrad CPC Camcorder ATI Technologies Sega 32X Embedded system Hydrogen economy Laserdisc MP3 H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Mac mini Price discrimination Sony Comparison of media players Virtual memory Machinima Mutual fund System/36 Windows Vista Video game publisher High-definition television Data General Wintel SAM Coup__ CD-ROM CD recorder Booting Mozilla Firefox Sega Blu-ray Disc Compact disc Macintosh Plus Console wars DVD player Microsoft History of operating systems Commodore REU Disk image Nintendo Entertainment System Hash table Microprogram DualDisc Karaoke Apple IIGS

whats the best linux live cd i keep hearing that linux is better than windows and so i was looking on google for live cds which you can try trouble is there are so many different ones im not sure what is best as i would like one which is a desktop and is not specified to do a certian job and preferably one which i can install onto my hard drive and make it my operating system if its better please help personally i think live cd's aren't the way to go they don't install and they don't detect half your hardware most of the time if you want to give linux a try i recommend a program called wubi http wubi installer org it installs any one of the four flavors of ubuntu linux like a windows program if you decide you don't like it you can go to add remove programs and get rid of every trace of it you get a real install without partitioning your hard drive it does this by creating a huge file and making a virtual drive out of it this makes it a tad bit slower than a real install on a seperate partition but a hell of a lot faster than running it off a cd later on if you want to partition and install the traditional and more permanent way the iso file is in your c wubi folder just turn that into a cd with your cd burning software uniinstall wubi and use the cd to partition and install wubi takes a while when you launch it it downloads a megabyte iso file which takes an hour or three depending on your connection then installs linux which takes another minutes once you got it up and running it's pretty impressive way better than a live cd  BitTorrent World Wide Web Uniform Resource Locator HyperText Transfer Protocol Wget Domain Name System Azureus Internet Web server Mozilla Firefox Apache HTTP Server Domain name I2P Representational State Transfer Website Jabber Warez JSON CPAN HTTP cookie Streaming media Common Unix Printing System VJ Kademlia Wireless Application Protocol Session Initiation Protocol Bbc.co.uk Transport Layer Security Internet censorship in mainland China Spyware Squid cache Anonymous P2P Web crawler Ajax (programming) Magnet link Proxy server SAML Unix MD5 User agent Uniform Resource Identifier World Trade Organization MSN Messenger Mozilla Application Suite MUD Google Web Accelerator Slapt-get Sikhism Router Opera house Federal Standard 1037C Virtual hosting File Transfer Protocol Port numbers File-sharing program Kazaa Java Servlet Freeware Subversion (software) Gmail Phishing Gopher protocol Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition Gnutella Committee for a Workers' International Digital art Transmission Control Protocol Secure Shell X.509 Typosquatting Extraterrestrial hypothesis Cyber bullying Ecclesiastical Latin Peer-to-peer Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Slash (punctuation) Unreal Tournament Web cache Remote procedure call Dictionary Web browser Web traffic 400 (number) Kuzari Wikisource Kurdistan Scalable Vector Graphics Economy of Colombia Netscape Navigator Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition HyperCard Television network Network Time Protocol Suprnova.org Cross site scripting Solar variation MIME MoveOn 386BSD

in excel when i copy a cell to paste it the size of the pasted cell changes how do i make the pasted cell matches the same size of the copied cell automatically without me changing it tried special paste with format but i only got the format without the text your question is a bit confusing so here are ways depending on what you are trying to do instead of copying the cell copy the contents in the formula bar at top and then paste it in the cell of the other sheet that way it will maintain the format of the destination sheet or when you copy a cell from one sheet to another you get a little drop down box click on the down arrow and you can choose keep source formatting or match destination formatting hope either helps and good luck  The Walt Disney Company Vista, California Buena Vista, Virginia Chula Vista, California Lake Buena Vista, Florida Hack (technology slang) Windows XP Media Center Edition .hack Capistrano Unified School District Academy Award for Animated Short Film Windows Vista Outlook Express Boa Vista, Cape Verde Reedy Creek Improvement District WindowBlinds Information Society Microsoft Windows PayPal Battle of Buena Vista Hacker Isla Vista, California Duple Coachbuilders Limited Murrieta, California Ridge Route Station wagon Hack and slash Miramax Films RuneScape cheats .hack//SIGN Domain hack History of Microsoft Windows Mar Vista, Los Angeles, California Alta Vista (Ottawa) Tony Scott Vaporware Little Shop of Horrors .hack (video games) Playa Vista, Los Angeles, California Port Hacking ROM hacking Buena Vista Music Group Los Angeles Clippers Windows XP Taxicab .hack//Legend of the Twilight Bracelet Bulk vending Innocence: Ghost in the Shell San Dimas, California Wayne Corporation Doctor Wily Buena Vista Township, New Jersey John Betjeman NVIDIA Don DeLillo Inverse gambler's fallacy Ennio Morricone Social constructionism Buena Vista Park Lori Hacking Douglas Hewitt Hacking, 1st Baron Hacking Dziga Vertov .hack//QUARANTINE Social construction .hack//GIFT Aerosmith Toy Story Game programming Don Frye Don't Tell Me (Madonna song) MUMPS Web browser World Series Bella Vista, New South Wales E-mail address Next-Generation Secure Computing Base Black hat A Bug's Life Regions of Brazil Country code top-level domain Pun Roof and tunnel hacking Vista Way Aladdin (1992 film) Public Radio International San Diego Trolley Snowboarding Braxton Bragg Walt Disney Feature Animation Eagle (automobile) University of California, Santa Barbara .hack//MUTATION .hack//OUTBREAK Sleeping Beauty Castle Eazy-E EXpanded MultiPlayer Windows Server 2003 Curling Cirque du Soleil Opportunity cost Aura (.hack)

which is the best registry cleaning software the most user friendly i have seen is ccleaner and now a word of caution ask yourself why doesn't microsoft offer one and why do they warn you about the possibility of the system not being able to boot or be repaired if you modify the registry incorrectly also why does every software company that offers registry cleaners make you accept their license that says they are not responsible if anything goes wrong the registry is extremely complex and also very stable under normal use any entry's no longer used are marked and ignored these entry's may amount to a few thousand characters which are processed in nanoseconds so what is there to gain cleaning is really unnecessary and dangerous and unless you really know what you doing and make a backup before you mess with it you may have a real bad day just think about it  Windows XP Password Mouse (computing) IPod AmigaOS OpenDocument Macromedia Flash Screenshot Windows 2000 Emacs Object Desktop Trusted computing Gmail Stopping e-mail abuse Opera (web browser) Windows Vista Ebook Microsoft Word Microsoft Windows PaX Mozilla Firefox Floppy disk Copy protection International Phonetic Alphabet System/36 XML Wiki Unicode History of Microsoft Windows Password cracking System/34 Digital rights management Internet Relay Chat Portable Document Format Revision control Computer forensics Cascading Style Sheets Mac OS X v10.4 ZX Spectrum 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Microsoft Excel Phishing AppleScript $ale of the Century Mach kernel Gramophone record GNU Free Documentation License Hello world program RuneScape cheats E-mail C plus plus MDAC HTTP cookie Slot machine Killian documents Jumpstart 3rd Grade File Allocation Table Xbox 360 Yu-Gi-Oh!

do i need to add relationships to all tables in access i am creating a access database for work the database is going to be of hotel venues with tables such as name contact name room name room measurements equiptment available ect i have been on a access course and still have pretty much no idea what i'm doing i have made the tables and i know i have to join them up with relationships but as i need all the data in the tables to be connected do i just join all the tables up and then it will work this sounds to simple am i missing something out i'm really stuck and didnt expect access to be this complicated if someone can explain it to me in dummy terms that would be great my job depends on it so i would be very grateful thanks the relationships between the tables depend on how you've stored your data but not all tables need relate to all other tables look for relationships where one set of data applies to more than one row in another table for example you've indicated hotel name and room name each hotel would presumably have more than one room so the room table would contain a row for each room with all the information about the rooms measurements etc and a link or relationship pointer to the hotel name the hotel table would contain all the information about the hotel contact name etc only once but is linked to all the rooms at once through the relationship  Windows XP Windows 2000 Apple Macintosh Booting IBM PC compatible Linux Hard disk USB flash drive Windows 3.x Blue screen of death Virtual memory Apple II family Common Unix Printing System Floppy disk Library (computer science) System 7 (Macintosh) Computer virus Screenshot Knoppix Spyware FreeDOS Commodore 64 Atari 8-bit family Mac OS X Mouse (computing) Embedded system Personal computer DOS System/36 Kernel (computer science) File system Emacs Perl IA-32 NeXT Microsoft Windows Windows Vista Laptop Partition (computing) BASIC programming language NX bit Windows Server 2003 Redundant array of independent disks Hello world program Nintendo GameCube Computer software Mach kernel Windows registry CPU design PHP Random access memory Macintosh Finder 64-bit Atari ST TRS-80 Color Computer Portable Document Format Upper Memory Area Copy protection Macromedia Flash Acorn Electron ZX Spectrum IMac Ethernet Apple Computer History of the graphical user interface Rootkit Java programming language Sun Microsystems MIPS architecture WordPerfect BIOS Ajax (programming) RISC HyperCard Computer forensics Novell NetWare Mozilla Firefox PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay TRS-80 Btrieve IBM PC Disk cloning CPU cache Timeline of computing 1990-forward PC Engine WordStar OpenVMS History of Microsoft Windows

microsoft word clipart problem i just wanted a bloody clipart pre given and included in microsoft word so i try to insert a clipart when it started taking and organizing every single file in my computer pictures songs etc what the heck is going on and how do i get rid of it its embarassing because now if someone tries to find a clipart by searching 'girl' on the computer for something innocent they'll find me and my girlfriend in your program files under microsoft office tools you may have the ms clip organizer you can go through the items and delete the ones you do not want included you may also want to set the location of your clip art in word by going to tools options file locations how did it happen probably when you opened the clip art taskpane there is an search in option to check everywhere you can change that to search in a specific location hope that helps and good luck  OpenOffice.org Microsoft Office OpenDocument StarOffice Windows XP Warez Copyright infringement of software Mozilla Firefox Microsoft .NET Pretty Good Privacy Linux distribution Microsoft Common criticisms of Microsoft WordPerfect Spyware Stardock Macromedia Flash Linux Computer virus Copy protection Wine (software) Mac OS X MP3 BitTorrent XML Open-source software Digital rights management Microsoft Excel Laptop GNOME DVD Free software Sun Microsystems SCO-Linux controversies GNU General Public License Richard Stallman DR-DOS Mozilla Application Suite Pirate decryption OpenBSD Modchip Open source culture Wget Perl MDAC Java programming language Knoppix Intellectual property X Window System Transport Layer Security GIMP Emacs Berkeley Software Distribution Windows Vista Public key infrastructure History of Microsoft Windows QuickTime Unicode Apple Macintosh Timeline of computing 1990-forward United States Postal Service ROM image Ubuntu Linux Portable Document Format Software cracking Windows 2000 IPod ITunes Music Store Craps Patch (computing) Compiler optimization Trusted computing USB flash drive Apache HTTP Server Linspire Debian MD5 ReactOS Python programming language Copyright infringement Tablet PC VBulletin Microeconomics Year 2000 problem Xbox Bulletin board system MS-DOS Make Abandonware SUSE Linux C plus plus Library (computer science) Xbox 360 CPAN Atari 8-bit family GNU KDE Bluetooth

should i backup my mac before i run boot camp on apple's boot camp software it tells me to backup my mac now i don't know if this is mandatory or not has anyone had any problems with boot camp and installing vista on a mac if so please answer i have tried it and it worked fantastic i bet the only thing that they are worried about is that when you install and use vista and hook it up to the internet you could get viruses which would attack your data so when you install vista make sure you have a antivirus program ready to install that's probably the only reason why they want you to back it up vista has a lot of viruses ps you're never save so a backup of important files would be smart  BitTorrent Macromedia Flash Mozilla Firefox Spyware Linux distribution Kazaa Azureus PHP Uploading and downloading Google Desktop Peer-to-peer CPAN Google Dictionary Wget Gmail Suprnova.org Google Video Uniform Resource Locator Anti-virus software OpenOffice.org Pretty Good Privacy Macintosh Finder Knoppix Download manager Perl Domain Name System Linspire Windows XP GIF Computer virus Web crawler Mac OS X Windows Vista Microsoft Office ITunes Halo: Combat Evolved Microsoft Windows Opera (web browser) IPod Minesweeper (computer game) Internet Relay Chat EDonkey2000 Object Desktop Portable Document Format Malware Website Filename extension Mandriva Linux Windows Mobile EMule Kademlia Linux HyperCard Typosquatting Forth programming language Windows registry StarOffice QuickTime Pop-up ad LimeWire Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Windows 2000 Option key File-sharing program Click fraud MSN Messenger Search engine optimization Microsoft .NET Dialer Internet Explorer GNOME USB flash drive Web traffic File format NPAPI Package management system Online music store P__li File sharing Mozilla Application Suite AdSense Visual Basic .NET Yahoo!

i need a software program for audio editing and dg mixer im looking for a software for removing voice from beat and to make my own beats audio recording and dj mixer with turn table is there one program that that can do all that or if not wht are the best out now for free to do this sony's screenblast acid the version i own this one detects beats in clips and allows you to create music using clips and recordings or if you really want value for money magix's music maker i own v v is the latest but costs about v should be available for about this one allows you to record audio and midi if you want also allows for some really good recording options such as hear and record without automatically mixing existing tracks into the new one you are recording by dj mixer w turntable i am assuming that you mean the hardware if you meant software then all i can say is that i have seen a product like that at best buy but that was gosh a couple of years ago i think it was a magix product that calls for additional computer hardware such as creative audigy zs or creative audigy nx basically you are looking for something that that is usb based so you can pull it closer to you equipement or can be installed to the front of your pc so you don't have to grit your teeth while trying plug in the output of your equipment to the pc about that voice from beat thingy unless you go for something really profession such as vst steinberg et al each could ding you for approx and up there is precious little that cheap and or free software can do for you the closest solution i can suggest for under is hold your breath the creative audigy nx solution actually any creative product because the key to voice removal is in the software that comes with the hardware the device control software allows for karaoke settings which kind of double loops the track and attempts to almost eliminate the original voice not bad for something that really costs so little but be aware the results may be far from perfect and i can tell right away the final result definitely wouldn't sound like one of those tracks heads up you will have to find a way to combine these tools to get to your final destination which is what professionals do anyway other than that you should be all set to go i wish you the best in your attempt soon after my initial post i saw the post above me mentioning audacity yes it is free and can do a whole bunch of stuff without you having to shell out much  IPod Mouse (computing) Macromedia Flash Screenshot Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Windows Movie Maker PlayStation Portable Computer and video games DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Oscilloscope International Phonetic Alphabet Music video Gramophone record DVD Window Maker DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Digital photography MSN Messenger QuickTime Windows Vista DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX ITunes Stereoscopy Digital video Telescope DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Palm OS Windows XP GunZ The Duel Hello world program Nintendo DS VHS Microsoft Paint IMovie Double Dragon Google Desktop Gmail Danger Hiptop Sony Ericsson K750i Nintendo GameCube AppleScript Movie projector Dance Dance Revolution 3rdMIX Option key Slot machine Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Doom engine Windows Mobile Television High-definition television Homestar Runner Quarashi Nintendo Entertainment System The Ashlee Simpson Show Teletext Machinima Floppy disk Pump It Up Fischer Random Chess History of the graphical user interface ILife Prank flash Verizon Wireless Aerial (dance move) Taskbar Laserdisc Anaglyph image Minesweeper (computer game) Liquid crystal display Polarization Multimedia Messaging System The Sims 2: University Point groups in three dimensions Super Nintendo Entertainment System Inkscape VHF omnidirectional range Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Drill bit 50 Cent Dial M for Murder Yu-Gi-Oh!

excel advanced lookup question okay i am a little lost i am using excel and basically i need to create a spreadsheet that will allow users to select one of something choices courses of study in this case and then have the table autopopulate the course type hours and evaluation i think i can use the lookup but am unsure of the method formula is that clear i need excel to autofill in the value of three other cells all in a row based on the value it's text of the first cell any help would be much appreciated forgot to add this in the course name cella the student can type in a course that will not be found in the lookup range is there anyway to get excel to display something other than an n a or error message when this happens let's say the course information is on sheet in a d with course name in column a type in b hours in c and evaluation in d on sheet is where users select the course and you autofill the information so you would have the following for example on row in a course name selected by user in b vlookup a 'sheet ' a d false in c vlookup a 'sheet ' a d false in d vlookup a 'sheet ' a d false a is what it's looking to match in column a of sheet a d is the range it will look in for data the offset of or is how many columns to the right it will go to find the data the range must be wide enough to accomodate the offset obviously if you try to go to the th column it will return an error the false means that the data in column a doesn't have to be sorted it also means it will look for an exact match in b the vlookup looks for the course name in a in column a of sheet when it finds it it goes to the nd column in the range i e column b to brings back the course type in c if goes to the rd column and gets the hours and so on if sheet is in an different file from sheet then you would have this vlookup a ' other file name sheet ' a d false if you set up the formulas with the other file open you don't need to fill in the path excel will fill it in when you close the other file any questions add detail or email good luck edit if the vlookup doesn't find a and returns an error you can look for that and display a blank instead if iserror vlookup a 'sheet ' a d false vlookup a 'sheet ' a d false  Windows 2000 Copy protection The Sims 2 Blue screen of death .NET assemblies Machinima Cmd.exe MegaMan Battle Network 2 Ebook Digital rights management Modchip Mod (computer gaming) Warez Windows registry Simplified Chinese character Files-11 The Sims MegaMan Battle Network Computer virus System 7 (Macintosh) Steam (content delivery) Trojan horse (computing) Windows Vista Wget Disk image Bluetooth Hot Coffee mod Windows API Buffer overflow BitTorrent Visual Basic Macintosh Finder Stardock Tribes 2 Btrieve NTFS Kazaa Perl Patch (computing) MediaMax CD-3 Malware Microsoft .NET MegaMan Battle Network (video game) Pneumonia Half-Life 2 Big Brother (USA TV series) PHP Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing Dave Sim Bish__jo game LiteStep Terminate and Stay Resident Compiler COMMAND.COM Rootkit The Sims 2: Nightlife Magic number (programming) Halo: Combat Evolved ITunes Mandriva Linux Lotus Notes DVD Windows XP Backup OpenBSD Anti-virus software Mega Man Baseball CPAN Chrono Trigger soundtrack Library (computer science) Spyware REBOL LiveCD Military history of Australia Mozilla Application Suite Mercury (element) PlayStation 2 WordPerfect Windows 3.x Dynamic-Link Library Enterprise content management Partition (computing) MAME Object Desktop Public domain Colossal Cave Adventure Windows 1.0 Resident Evil (video game) APL programming language Homestar Runner Gmail ILOVEYOU Flight simulator Danger Hiptop MSH (shell) Mac OS X RAR Windows Me User agent

what is a good program for editing video on the computer i don't mind buying though share or free ware would be welcomed i am looking to create a music video for my favorite song as i don't like the one produced by the artist i don't have any video editing experience and the camera i have is a mini dvd so any clips would be pulled off of the dvd since you don't have any video editing experience i highly recommend you use imovie if you have a mac or windows movie maker which should already come with windows xp they are both easy to use and fairly intuitive adobe premier is the high end program but you probably will not use many of the functions it has also adobe premier was fairly hard for me to learn how to use i had actually used windows move maker in the end to do most of my edits i suggest using a low end program learning how to use it then buying a more sophisticated program once you start needing more functionality  OpenOffice.org Microsoft Office StarOffice OpenDocument Microsoft Excel ReactOS Sun Microsystems Apache HTTP Server Microsoft Word Free software Open format Open-source software Open Database Connectivity Mozilla Firefox World Wide Web Wget HTTP cookie Reverse engineering Quotation mark Session Initiation Protocol Proxy server Internet Uniform Resource Locator AbiWord GIMP HyperText Transfer Protocol Microsoft Apple II family Mydoom Scalable Vector Graphics Ebook Macromedia Flash Domain Name System E-mail Afrikaans Application software Portable Document Format Stardock Sun Industry Standards Source License Digital audio workstation Google XML Website BitTorrent WebDAV BASIC programming language Common criticisms of Microsoft Ajax (programming) KDE WordPerfect Streaming media Copyleft Software componentry Apple Computer IBM PC compatible GNU General Public License Web server Web browser Microsoft Publisher Intellectual property Presentation program Richard Stallman Usenet Slashdot subculture SAML Windows Mobile History of Microsoft Windows Mozilla Application Suite X Window System Microsoft PowerPoint Zulu language Machine translation USB flash drive HyperCard Phishing Proprietary software MSN Messenger Linux Copyright infringement of software Microsoft Windows Internet Information Services Quattro Pro CPAN Opera (web browser) GNOME Corel Macro Jabber Slashdot The Book of Mozilla Microsoft Access Flowchart Digital video recorder Spyware Xbox

what is the best lenux for my ibook what is the best lenux for my ibook and where can i get it depending on how old your ibook is this makes no sense in getting linux for the ibook if your system is at least a ghz g w mb ram bought in the last two years apple's macos x is a posix unix operating system linux is itself another posix minix based operating system in fact if you have learned how to use the apple macos unix terminal on your ibook the commands in any linux terminal are excatly the same in several cases with only minor tweaking macos can actually run several of the freeware apps originally created on linux if you have a desktop pc ie dell ibm gateway hp that is where i would install linux if you are a first time linux user then i would look to ubuntu linux with the gnome desktop fiesty fawn ubuntu linux is not the most advanced linux out there but it is nearly as easy to use as both windowsxp and macosx and is very stable and idiot resistant even its installation from dvd is graphical and friendly as i said i would not overwrite your macos x install on your ibook this would be like replacing a mustang from one dealership with mustang from another dealership just because being from a different dealership makes the car different ubuntu linux and macos x are both unix linux distro operating systems i would look at any desktop that you have around you and run ubuntu linux on that system the official website for ubuntu linux is www ubuntu com ubuntu is distributed by canonical inc when at the ubuntu website select download and the most popular version of their linux is the one running the gnome desktop this is usually the first distro available for download and the one with the most support this is also the distro that dell is currently factory installing with their systems the os is free for download but you will need to use an iso dvd disc image expander the one i used personally was my ibook's macos x disk utilities this app comes as a part of os x on your ibook to find this app on your ibook go to spotlight in the top right corner on the os x file bar and click on the magnifying glass icon then type disk utility the top hit on the appearing list should be the app disk utility click on this launching disk utility while making sure that you have a compatible dvd r or cd r disc in your ibook's dvd drive select the saved ubuntu linux disc iso image on your systems hard drive as the image you want burned to disc this process will take several minutes after the disc is burned find an x desktop pc or x intel based imac and you can run the installation of ubuntu linux on either of those machines the powerpc g based ibook cannot run ubuntu linux right now although there are some linux's on the net designed for powerpc macs most are fairly complicated to run and install and many lack basic productivity apps the process i just explained is how to download and burn the ubuntu linux installation cd dvd using your ibook  DVD AVI Macromedia Flash Laserdisc Enterprise content management Disk image Video codec Windows XP QuickTime Blu-ray Disc DivX WavPack PlayStation Portable Digital rights management High-definition television Windows Media Video VHS H.264/MPEG-4 AVC AmigaOS Super Audio CD Warez DualDisc Screenshot Quest for Glory Radeon Karaoke DVD player DVD-RAM Nero Wolfe Floppy disk MP3 Movie projector ALGOL 68 Explosive material Compact disc Musical Instrument Digital Interface The Criterion Collection PlayStation 3 Visual Basic Ripping Pioneer Corporation CD recorder DV 8 mm video format Nintendo GameCube Camcorder CD-ROM Nero Digital XML AviSynth Forth programming language Volleyball Comparison of media players Xbox Apple II family Hard disk Winamp Widescreen Copy protection Iriver Sega Dreamcast Enhanced Versatile Disc Baseball Stars Table tennis Knoppix Cue sheet Backup Virtual memory SCSI The Emancipation of Mimi Nero Ebook Digital camera Yu-Gi-Oh!

in vista get a popup window with title windows script host and content object error what is it every time i start up my notebook with vista i get a small window that only says object error the title of the window is windows script host any idea what this is could it be related to my notebook freezing everyday so that i have to use the power button to shut down and restart ctrl alt del doesn't work and the mouse won't move windows script host is the script interpreter for windows basically it's what's used to run certain types of scripts on the windows operating system bottom line when you start your pc there is some application or service legitimate or otherwise that is attempting to run a script on your computer there is an error in the code or there is some file service functionality or otherwise that's the object it's referring to that's missing and the script needs that object to run successfully here are some things you can check i don't have vista here so hopefully these xp instructions will work for you start run eventvwr check all of the log types most likely you'll see some errors that tie to your object error message i'm guessing you'll see them in either the application log or the system log most likely the application log start run msconfig then go to the startup tab all of the entries you see are applications services etc which start when your pc starts the command column lists the actual file that's being run look for something with a vbs extension that may be your culprit if you don't want to troubleshoot it yourself just look up that entry on google and see whether it's required for example if you find a syscfg vbs under the command column just do a google search on syscfg vbs there are a few good sites that should come up at the top of the results and these will give you an idea of what it is go to c documents and settings all users start menu programs startup whatever you see in this folder is executed when you log in to your pc also look in the same path except replace the all users part with your username start run regedit then expand hkey local machine software microsoft windows currentversion run highlight the run part and then look on the right hand side if there is anything there it's something that runs when you log in if you don't find anything in any of these locations it could be one of the services that is running i can't really explain how to investigate those in this answer i'm hoping you'll find something in step that will give you an answer if you find anything in any of these steps just do a quick update to your question here telling us what you've found and we can take it from there  DOS IBM PC compatible Delphi programming language User agent Wine (software) Microsoft Windows WordPerfect Linux MS-DOS Mac OS X GNU X Window System Windows 3.x Windows 2000 Microsoft Office AMD64 X86 FreeDOS Personal computer OpenOffice.org Symbian OS Common Unix Printing System Palm OS NX bit Free Pascal Java programming language Integrated development environment GNOME Timeline of computing 1990-forward Adobe Acrobat PHP Mandriva Linux Unix Macromedia Flash Cross-platform MSN Messenger Unix shell NTFS Windows XP DirectX DLL hell Windows 95 OS/2 PowerPC AS/400 DragonFly BSD Free software Linspire Lotus Notes TRS-80 64-bit OpenStep Visual Basic ITunes Control-Alt-Delete Microsoft Word GNU General Public License Python programming language File Allocation Table Windows XP Professional x64 Edition StarOffice WordStar Ubuntu Linux Comparison of media players Windows API Booting Perl AmigaOS IA-64 Vorbis Sound Blaster PearPC DESQview RPM Package Manager Hello world program Microsoft .NET Windows 1.0 Pocket PC Xen Session Initiation Protocol IPod Microprocessor Platform (computing) Gambas Upper Memory Area FreeBSD Xbox Visual FoxPro Skype ReactOS Linux distribution Application programming interface Apple Macintosh LabVIEW Comparison of file systems Knoppix IA-32

can you correct a blurred photograph with photoshop and fix colour problems i took some pictures with my digital camera some of them havent turned out that great my hands werent steady and now some of the pictures are blurred i have photoshop but am not that used to it and just wondered if there's any way i could fix the photos with it any tips tutorials on what to do i'd just love to get them more clear and less fuzzy the other thing is one of the people in the picture is blond but their hair looks orangey in one picture is there anyway you can alter the colour to make it less reddy orange i dont know why it's like that in one picture but normal blond in another can anything be done with the pictures thanks if you've got camera shake then there's nothing you can do all the sharpening in the world will do nothing except add artefacts to the image what you need to do is use a faster shutter speed or if indoors then use a flashgun the colour problem is simpler open image and select adjustments try the autolevels color sic sections if they don't work then you'll have to use the hue saturation section make sure the preview box is checked so you can see what's going on btw the orange red cast may be because of the lighting alternatively it may be the camera setting the wrong white balance unless you shoot raw format there's nothing easy to correct this just the suggestions above jbv  Apache HTTP Server Web server PHP ITunes Amstrad CPC Wget Free software World Wide Web Ajax (programming) Digital rights management Comparison of media players Streaming media Laserdisc Apple II family MP3 BitTorrent PHP-Nuke CPAN Internet MiniDisc Modchip Web browser Web application DVD CD recorder Cue sheet QuickTime Uniform Resource Locator DVD-RAM HyperText Transfer Protocol CD-ROM Commodore 64 Secure Shell LAMP (software bundle) MySQL Compact disc Copy protection Common Unix Printing System Winamp Covermount Session Initiation Protocol Gramophone record Nintendo 64 Windows XP MSN Messenger Object-SQL mapping HyperCard Phonograph Easter egg (virtual) Tron (film) Compact audio cassette Domain Name System ICalendar XMLHTTP Wikipedia Disc jockey USB flash drive AOL Instant Messenger Macromedia Flash Mozilla Firefox Knoppix Windows Mobile Gmail CD-R Spyware Perl Unix Web design MediaMax CD-3 Windows Media Player Regional lockout Object-oriented programming Sony MediaWiki Nintendo GameCube Nullsoft Streaming Video Open Database Connectivity GNOME Unreal Tournament Richard Stallman Managed learning environment GIF ILife Application software Gracenote Development stage CDDB Data remanence Mixtape Floppy disk Shareware Apple Computer Multimedia Messaging System Slashdot trolling phenomena RealPlayer Source code Player piano The Walt Disney Company

vista and torrents cannot open port i just upgraded to vista ultimate and now can't open a port for torrents i have already setup my router to forward the port and the vista firewall i even shut off the firewall to see if that would work it worked great in xp and i thought i was relativiely advanced with this stuff any suggestions my vista upgrade has not been easy check to make sure you saved your router settings also if you are using utorrent make sure it is not randomizing the port last if you are behind a router you should check your ip address is the one you used for port forwarding routers dynamically assign the nat address so if there are other computers behind the router it may change your address each time you log in you can try to configure your router to put you in the dmz zone and see if that helps if you are connectable in the dmz but not behind the router then it is your router config thats all you can do open ports in router and unblock your firewall if it is not a firewall problem and your router is open then it is not a port problem when i got the new puters here and hooked em up they did indeed get assigned new lan ip's check in your router and see what lan ip it may have assigned you i had the same problem using bitlord change to utorrent worked perfectly make sure they match utorrent all my suggestions are from the voice of experience these stupid little things will drive you nuts when you figure the problem you smack yourself in the head the solution usually comes after you have gone crazy from trying for over two hours to figure out what is wrong  Booting USB flash drive Dual boot LiveCD Boot image FreeDOS BIOS Windows XP Partition (computing) Linux Knoppix Windows 2000 Computer virus File system Password cracking Malware Microsoft Windows Computer surveillance Windows Server 2003 SYSLINUX Spyware Rootkit GRand Unified Bootloader Password Hard disk GNOME Computer forensics AmigaOS System 7 (Macintosh) Digital rights management MAME Windows 3.x Modchip Mac OS 9 Disk cloning Backdoor Puppy Linux PlayStation 2 IBM PC compatible Control-Alt-Delete IPod Surveillance MediaMax CD-3 Preboot Execution Environment Windows registry NTLDR Blue screen of death Apple II family Disk image PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Monkey Island Personal computer Apple Macintosh Telnet Trojan horse (computing) Boot image control Oracle database Thin client NTFS Commodore 64 Installer Stopping e-mail abuse Secure Shell Apple Remote Desktop Baldur's Gate series Passphrase Case modding RISC OS Windows 95 Screensaver Copy Control File Allocation Table SUSE Linux Bootable business card Virtual Network Computing DVD-RAM Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing SAM Coup__ WordPerfect Compact disc Apple Computer Computer role-playing game Net Yaroze Filename extension QuickTime Phishing RSTS/E Anachronox Copyright infringement of software Kerberos (protocol) Upper Memory Area Mandriva Linux Desktop computer Sega Dreamcast Two-factor authentication Final Fantasy VI Floppy disk Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol MIPS architecture
