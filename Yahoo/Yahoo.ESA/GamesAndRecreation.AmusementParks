which do you like better disney world or universal studios and why i prefer universal studios because disney world is aimed at children and have only one or two adult rides universal on the other hand is aimed more at the adults it has amazing roller coasters the mummy the ride was awesome it broke down for about five minutes while i was in line so the wait was only about ten minutes for me because of everybody leaving the line  Disney's California Adventure Universal Orlando Resort Disney-MGM Studios Amusement park Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Roller coaster Aerosmith Walt Disney World Resort Magic Kingdom Walt Disney Who Framed Roger Rabbit Disneyland Resort Paris Hersheypark Big Thunder Mountain Railroad Millennium Force Space Mountain Disneyland RollerCoaster Tycoon Six Flags New England Paramount's Kings Island Launched roller coaster Cedar Point Disney's Animal Kingdom Orlando, Florida Wooden roller coaster Masato Tanaka Kennywood Happiest Homecoming on Earth Intamin AG Anchor California Screamin' Matterhorn Bobsleds Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Thorpe Park Whitney Houston The Walt Disney Company DisneyMania Six Flags Six Flags Magic Mountain Paramount Canada's Wonderland SeaWorld Valleyfair!

asking about six flags st louis i was wondering if i am wearing a cast that goes right below my knee can i ride any of the rides and if i rent a wheel chair how much is it and where do you put the wheel chair while you are on the rides i'm not sure about wearing a cast and riding all the rides although i don't see why you couldn't it seems like i've seen kids in the past wearing casts that rode rides but i haven't been there this year so things may have changed all of the rides at flags st louis have a wheelchair handicap accessible entrance where you and your group will get moved to the front of the line pretty nice benefit if you ask me and your group should thank you for not having to wait in the long lines when you get up to each ride there is usually a place to leave your wheelchair i've attached the national link for flags you can select flags st louis to get a contact number i would call guest services to get the details have fun http www sixflags com national index aspx  Wheelchair Disneyland Milton H.

is busch gardens tampa better than busch gardens europe cause everone says europe is better me too they have da griffon it's all a matter of personal opinion personally the thrill seeker in me prefers williamsburg but the off roading safari lover in me prefers tampa here's a short description of each with some must rides for ya williamsburg is great for families with kids in that pre teen to teen thrill seeker age group with more roller coasters of an aggressive nature and in my opinion more of a theme park feel of course you also get oktoberfest in europe which is awesome in october and anheiser also gets to show off their coveted clydesdales and beer wagon but the rides in williamsburg is where busch gardens shines here roller coasters thrill rides high tech motion simulator themed fairground type areas and some of the best food you'll ever get to sample from all over europe without a passport apollo's chariot alpengeist loch ness monster escape from pompei roman river rapids and the newest edition to the bunch griffon comprise the coasters with new high tech thrills make sure to ride curse of darkastle think the amazing adventures of spiderman at universal's islands of adventure d multi sensory motion ride tampa is one of those cool zoo meets theme park type that offers more to do for the whole family young old its differing areas and continents are more suited to the climate of their respective countries and resembles the climate of tampa year round with animals and rides that are both fun and designed to be at least a little informative montu informative yep read some of the info posted in the queue line about all the pagan gods and such in egypt of course tampa bay is home to jack hanna and his animal adventures base camp and rhino rally is an especially cool way to see some big animals up close while keeping more of a ride mentality thrills here are bigger allbeit fewer coasters and themed flat rides with an animal show here and there lots of fun to sit in the splash zone also make sure to ride akbar's adventure here it's kind of out of the way and unknown but martin short makes a great appearance in this fun little ride so basically after a short synopsis of each it all boils down to personal opinion as to which is better i really think it depends on who's all in the group you're going with as long as everybody's having a great time  Busch Gardens Williamsburg Roller coaster Disney's California Adventure Universal Orlando Resort Paramount's Kings Island Disney's Animal Kingdom Hersheypark Orlando, Florida Cedar Point Bolliger and Mabillard Scooby-Doo Knoebels Tampa, Florida Disneyland Paramount's Carowinds Six Flags Great Adventure Magic Kingdom Knott's Berry Farm Epcot Disney-MGM Studios Six Flags Over Texas Cobra roll Amusement ride Six Flags Hampton Roads Paramount Canada's Wonderland Kennywood RollerCoaster Tycoon LEGOLAND Windsor Walt Disney World Resort Chessington World of Adventures Kingda Ka Wooden roller coaster Six Flags Magic Mountain Cypress Gardens Indiana Jones Adventure Lightwater Valley Japanese tea ceremony Loch Ness Monster Dogpatch USA Drachen Fire Six Flags Astroworld Dreamworld Holiday World & Splashin' Safari The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror Launched roller coaster Pacific Ocean Park Coney Island K__ppen climate classification Edinburgh Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Pok__mon (anime) Big Thunder Mountain Railroad Passport Paramount's Kings Dominion Birmingham, Alabama Yu-Gi-Oh!

what are some ways i can secure my digital camera during a roller coaster ride i want to record footage of da ride wat are some ideas on how to secure it most operators will ask or insist that you put your camera away they don't care if it breaks they care about it flying out of your hand and hitting another passenger or a person on the ground below my suggestion is do not try to do this it is dangerous for the other people around you if you are holding the camera up to your eye during the ride you also run the risk of injuring yourself just enjoy the ride you'll see more looking around with your eyes than your camera will capture  Roller coaster Knoebels Jessica Lynch Camera Closed-circuit television Escalator Kingda Ka Wooden roller coaster Delta Goodrem Bolliger and Mabillard Professional wrestling throws Flying roller coaster Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Quentin Tarantino Surveillance Paramount Canada's Wonderland Aerosmith Baseball Vekoma Shen Gong Wu Digital photography Intamin AG Disney-MGM Studios Kennywood Camcorder Movie projector Ocean's Twelve Magic Kingdom Sport utility vehicle Burning Man Three Stooges Stunt Motion capture Airport security Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Privacy 8 mm video format Paramount's Carowinds John F.

is disneyworld separated into different theme parks like the disneyland resort disneyland and california's adventure is separate and you have to pay for each one or at least get a park hopper ticket in disneyworld do you also have to pay for the different locations of the theme park like epcot and animal kingdom yep all are seperate if your still in the planning stages i hope this helps you will need about days to do all of magic kingdom most like disneyland days for epcot half the park rides and half is shopping through the various countries you can try and cram animal kingdom into a day and the same with mgm studios but take a day and to really make sure you see it all note mgm studios has alot of shows that are worth seeing but they only have a few showings each day so get there early and plan around them before you do the few rides that are in that park if you are staying in a disney resort make use of the extra magic hours before and after regular hours also the dining plan is really a great value but is only availible when you are staying in a disney resort the place is really huge and i don't doubt that you could fit disneyland park not including the other extra stuff like resorts and parking into the epcot parking lot it is basically a city onto itself has its own freeway system even quest is a story arcade an adult but is really fun but you really need a whole day to do that also kids love it when you price the tickets out getting a day pass with the hopping option and adding on the 'more' which gives you a few entrences to quest both water parks each day each park and pleasure island mostly dance clubs for over crowd it isn't very much for all the entertainment you recieve note quest is not at pleasure island it is at the far end of downtown disney and pleasure island is in the middle of the downtown disney area good luck on your planning and have fun  Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Disney's California Adventure Disneyland Walt Disney DisneySpeak The Walt Disney Company Disney-MGM Studios Epcot Disneyland Resort Paris Walt Disney Imagineering Disneyland Resort Magic Kingdom Disneyland Monorail System Anaheim, California Main Street Electrical Parade Carolwood Pacific Railroad Fantasmic!

what makes a good funfair pls be detailed loud music although i dont like it i think dance music works well in funfairs lots of food stalls around so you can smell candy floss it justs adds to the atmosphere i think going at night makes it better as all the lights turn on on the rides and there seems like theres more energy no queues for once would make a good funfair as i think queues really ruin the experience there would be loads of high adrenaline rides instead of the pathetic ones that arent family rides but arent exciting either and also a huge fun house they rock all that together sounds like a pretty good funfair  Funfair Carnival Indiana Jones Adventure Cotton candy Space Mountain Amusement ride King Crimson Epcot RuneScape skills House music Freestyle music Galileo spacecraft Parachuting Theatre Register renaming Deftones The Beatles discography Music genre Techno music The Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear Explosive material Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance Aurora (astronomy) Roxette Music video Death rock Queen (band) The Gathering demo party Hip hop culture KISS (band) Babe Ruth's Called Shot Jet engine Time Out of Mind Journey Into Imagination Honda CX series Web crawler Atomic Kitten Sly & the Family Stone Gliding RuneScape Mini-Games Music of Ireland Van Halen Buddy Guy The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Wind turbine Queue area Carbon dioxide Waylon Jennings Laser Heavy metal music Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Microeconomics Sonic Youth Mickey Mouse Drum and bass Anchor The Beach Boys Australian rock The Jam Photosynthesis Aladdin (1992 film) The Ashlee Simpson Show Gothic metal Roller coaster Rock Follies Rise of Nations Surf music Joni Mitchell Solar power Music of Minnesota Primal Scream Piccolo Junior Saga 2000 Australian Grand Prix E85 Squidward Tentacles Sampling (music) Trance music Spice Girls Social rule Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Music of the United Kingdom Jennifer Lopez Fried dough foods Equine conformation Rave party Halloween Unreal Solar cell Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Sense Music of the United Kingdom (1950s and 60s) The Proms David Bowie Bonnie Tyler Beavis and Butt-head Disc jockey Bicycle lighting Video game music Thermal power station

day trip to disneyland with teenager tips tricks i plan to take my year old to disneyland on saturday sunday i need some tips on making the best use of the fastpass the fun rides for teenagers the most efficient way to get to the rides that we like thanks go left why most people are right handed and naturally start off at their right side or those with small kids head straight into the castle for all the small kid rides i usually start with indiana jones then pirates splash moutian haunted mansion then i hop the train do a whole round the park and stay on one extra exit into toon town i ride the roger rabit cars yep its kiddie but it's fun and then get on the materhorn the line that starts closer to the kids alice in wonderland ride on the right from the entrance always seems to be shorter since it's closer to the kids area after that i check out the indy cars that line is always long and the fast pass helps about here and check the line for space mountian i get a fass pass for later on space mountian if the line is really long then its about lunchtime so sometime the line is short and then i head out of the park going left and walk a half a block to the mcdonald's right there accross the street enjoy my meal have an ice cream yep they got the dollar menu after lunch i stroll back to the park and do the indy cars and space mountian if i hadn't had a chance earlier i also usually do star tours because the line has really shortened by now for the rest of the afternoon i usualy just enjoy the atmosphere and maybe try to jump back on indiana jones by going as single riders your group gets broken up but hey you already rode it once together late afternoon i do big thunder mountian the line gets really short around dusk and maybe dumbo and a few kids rides i get a chimichanga or turkey leg from the cart across from the materhorn and maybe torture myself but i love it with small world then i head over to in front of the lake to find a seat for fantasmic if you get there about an hour or minuites before showtime there is a grouping of tables that are ment for seating for the fast food restraunt there that serves funnel cakes and such many people are just eating and if you keep an eye on those they will get up and leave the area and you can snag seating rather than stand while waiting for the show my hubby and i take turns on who's going potty and we usually pick up some hot chocolate and maybe a funnelcake to snack on while waiting for the show when fantasmic begins you may need to stand but don't stand on the chairs unless you kid is realy short so you don't block those behind you after that we really have seen and done most of the major things and we might wrap it up with a few of the smaller kids rides mr toads wild ride is really fun or we just head on out we stayed away from shopping all day carrying things or putiing them for later pickup in a long line is a hassle so we step right out onto downtown disney and the first shop is a big disney store that has just about anything you can find in the park and we spend a little time looking around there before we head home ps its just me and my hubby no kids so we concetrate on the big stuff if you are doing a hopper not really recommended since dl really takes a few day head over to ca adventure in the late afternoon and the lines for the few good rides there tower of terror the coaster soarin' and the swinging carts on the faris wheel are shorter the park is much smaller and anyone who planned on doing a full day in there has already done everything and left good luck and have fun  Magic Kingdom Walt Disney World Resort Skateboarding trick Walt Disney Hersheypark Amusement park Indianapolis 500 DisneySpeak Alton Towers The Family from One End Street Swingout The Haunted Mansion Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Shaggy dog story Disney-MGM Studios Indiana Jones Adventure RuneScape quests Equine conformation Epcot Professional wrestling holds MTR Disneyland Resort Paris Audio-Animatronics The Adventures of Pete & Pete Tiny Toon Adventures Trailer Park Boys Coney Island Professional wrestling throws The Walt Disney Company Spidey Super Stories The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Cuisine of Denmark Textile manufacturing Tokyo Disney Resort The Phantom Manor Recess (TV series) Bicycle Drag racing The Amazing Race Roller coaster Space Mountain The Fairly OddParents Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Professional wrestling attacks Pittsburgh Steelers Indiana Jones Volleyball Hey Arnold!

rollercoaster butterflies the worst part of roller coaters are the drops for me can i get rid of these butterflies in my stomach during the drop the butterflies is the blood rushing up it's the best part of the rollercoaster ride and the only reason i go on them in the first place you get the same feeling in an airplane if it loses altitude quickly what you do is flex all the muscles in your body and you won't feel it as much plus your mind will concentrate on flexing the easiest way to do that is to scream i can't stand when people scream on rollercoasters because for me that would take out all the fun i guess different people enjoy the rides for different reasons  Thorpe Park Roller coaster Professional wrestling holds Alton Towers Hersheypark RollerCoaster Tycoon Professional wrestling throws Ekadasi Shen Gong Wu Suplex Anchor Powerbomb Aerial (dance move) Bob Backlund Car handling Anatomical terms of location Knoebels Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Bicycle Fixed-wing aircraft Final Destination 3 Humerus California Screamin' Dreamworld Self-harm Six Flags Magic Mountain Amusement ride Wonder Woman (television series) Stomach The Inside Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom New York Giants Bodybuilding Equine conformation Spice Girls Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Jackass: The Movie Chessington World of Adventures Disney's Animal Kingdom Bondage (BDSM) Weight training DDT (professional wrestling) Parachuting Shock Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breech birth Front crawl Backstroke Livewires Stomach cancer Backbreaker Six Flags Over Texas Blackpool Pleasure Beach Swimming Paramount's Kings Dominion Snake Decompression sickness Paragliding Insect Holiday World & Splashin' Safari Escalator Hitchhiking Social rule Archery Naruto jutsu Butterfly stroke Carburetor Breaststroke Geri Halliwell Game show Muhammad Ali Silver Dollar City Theory of conduct Scream (film) Funfair Tlingit Animal testing Happy Tree Friends Blood (computer game) F.K.

why am i so terrified of roller coasters it seems like eveyone loves them and enjoys them i wanna enjoy them like everyone else i went on one called boulder dash in lake compounce and my back stomach and neck hurt sooo much after people said it was nothing but it was sooo scary for me how do i get rid of this fear is there a way to decrease the feeling when you ride a roller coaster help not everyone loves them my husband and my sister don't like them there's nothing wrong with feeling that way i've heard that the only fear we are born with is the fear of falling when you're on a roller coaster you feel like you're falling and instinctively it triggers fear if you really want to get over this you could start with some of the less wild coasters and work your way up  Amusement park Cedar Point Kennywood Roller coaster Hersheypark Paramount's Kings Island Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Knott's Berry Farm RollerCoaster Tycoon Valleyfair!

what kind of roller coasters do more people perfer wood or steel this is basicly a survey steel seems safer and the ride tends to be smoother which is good but wooden ones are really fun because i love the rickety noise they make i love gemini at cedar point that is my favorite ride in the park but steel are good the steel ones just tend to be bigger and i'm not that totally huge of a roller coaster person both have ups and downs but overall i think metal is better for pure riding enjoyment  Cedar Point Roller coaster Wooden roller coaster Intamin AG Hersheypark Knoebels Amusement park Millennium Force Paramount's Kings Island Six Flags Over Texas Kennywood Valleyfair!

how much are all day passes for santa cruz beach boardwalk what rides do they have is it worth it i'm going to the santa cruz beach boardwalk for my first time and i was wondering how much the all day ride wristbands are and what kind of rides they have are the rides any good is it more like a carnival rather than an amusement park which ride is the best it depends on which all day writstband you get they have just the rides and that is per person however right next door is the arcade this includes other things such as laser tag and mini golf so you can purchase an attraction plus wristband which gives you rides plus two other attractions if you buy them on line at least hours in advance they are the same price if you purchase it at the boardwalk it is each of the rides will run between and without the wristband so if you are going to be there more than a few hours it is probably worth getting the wristband except for the giant dipper wooden rollercoaster most are close to your typical fair or carnival rides  Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk Boardwalk Disney's California Adventure Amusement park Hersheypark Coney Island Santa Cruz, California Kennywood Roller coaster Walt Disney World Resort Blackpool Pleasure Beach Funfair Knoebels Alton Towers Wooden roller coaster RollerCoaster Tycoon Cedar Point Disneyland Amusement ride Carnival Playland (New York) Knott's Berry Farm Monopoly (game) Manila Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom Puerto de la Cruz, Santa Cruz de Tenerife Holiday World & Splashin' Safari Atlantic City, New Jersey Dorney Park Rio de Janeiro Pacific Ocean Park Chessington World of Adventures Thorpe Park Paramount Canada's Wonderland Michigan's Adventure California State Route 1 Six Flags Fiesta Texas Brazil at the 2004 Summer Olympics Efteling Blackpool Bay Area Rapid Transit Public transport Value Battersea Park Long Beach, New York Knuckles' Chaotix Disc golf DisneySpeak Disney's Animal Kingdom Star Tours Mountain bike Caltrain MetroCard San Francisco Bay Area University of California, Santa Cruz Bradley Nowell Venice, Los Angeles, California If You Had Wings Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time Epcot Ocean View, Virginia Six Flags Over Texas Pattaya Baseball Santa Monica, California The Beaches History of Santa Monica, California Huntington Beach, California Microeconomics Paramount's Kings Island Dawson Creek, British Columbia Nintendo Pacific Electric Railway Changeroom Timaru "it's a small world" Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Orlando, Florida Rail transport in Ireland Six Flags Great Adventure Indiana Jones Adventure World Columbian Exposition Six Flags Fair Livestrong wristband Sunnydale Santa Barbara, California Las Vegas Strip Siege of Veracruz Los Angeles County, California Disneyland Railroad Supply and demand Tax Glossary of American football $ale of the Century Hyperinflation Walt Disney Mutual fund Santa Monica Mountains Contra Costa County, California

is there a weight limit for the rides at six flags great adventures there are no weight limits however you must be able to fit within the restraints of the ride each ride is different i do know that they accomodate most people including large people i would make a a safe bet and assume that as long as you weigh pounds or less you are fine anything upward of that i don't think there is a non embarrassing way to find out other than going and trying because it really isn't about your weight it is about your girth this is what the six flags great adventures website says about riders' size limitations what is considered exceptional size where rides are concerned safety is our number one priority guests with certain body proportions height and or weight may not be able to participate on certain rides if the safety restraints will not operate as designed specific ride information is available at the ride and at guest relations  Top Thrill Dragster Equine conformation Bicycle Disney's California Adventure Car safety Roller coaster Explosive material Bicycle frame Bondage (BDSM) Weight training Fault tolerant design Mountain bike Motorcycle Horse Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Single Transferable Vote Anchor RollerCoaster Tycoon Bicycle lighting Recumbent bicycle Paragliding Doomsday argument Sport utility vehicle Condom Crash test dummy Car handling Horse tack Mass Paper size Weight Getaway Special Bicycle helmet Airbag Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Launched roller coaster Kingda Ka M16 (rifle) The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror School bus Segregated cycle facilities Boxing Knife Climbing specialist (cycling) Splash Mountain Six Flags Great Adventure Intamin AG Nuclear weapon design Boeing 737 Cedar Point Normal distribution Hunt seat Typeface Racing flags Gliding High-heeled shoe Birth weight TGV Hand grenade Eventing Road Bicycle brake systems Professional wrestling match types All-terrain vehicle Formula One regulations United States Postal Service NASCAR Heinkel He 112 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Six Flags Over Texas Snowboard Bike lane debate View camera Kitesurfing Diamond cut Snowboarding Obesity Weighing scale Wood Largest organism Poker jargon Betting (poker) OpenDocument Gee Welding Rail transport in Great Britain Shell (projectile) Super Size Me Intellectual property Glossary of climbing terms Washington Monument Tire Walt Disney World Railroad Toronto Transit Commission Glossary of graph theory British Rail Class 42 Horse gait Human sexual behavior Knoebels Consensus decision-making

a question about goliath at six flags magic mountain each roller coaster has a theme what is goliath's theme what country are the ruins supposed to be from theme with six flags was very specific in the early days but has been a little haphazard since the days after angus wynne sold the parks mostly the name comes from the fact that it is so large it's brother in texas is called titan and that it interacts with the existing wooden coaster colossus goliath really doesn't have a theme but the name does conjure up a feeling however it is in a tropical setting with no explanation way considering that it sits in the section of the park called colossus county fair so your guess is as good as mine  Six Flags Magic Mountain Amusement park Six Flags Over Texas Six Flags Cedar Point Thorpe Park Six Flags Astroworld Six Flags Over Georgia Magic Kingdom Six Flags Great Adventure Wooden roller coaster Paramount Canada's Wonderland Cobra roll RollerCoaster Tycoon Dorney Park Space Mountain Six Flags Fiesta Texas Walt Disney World Resort Big Thunder Mountain Railroad Hersheypark Geauga Lake Kennywood Bolliger and Mabillard Launched roller coaster Disney's California Adventure Knoebels Disney-MGM Studios Bogot__ Wall Street Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pacific Ocean Park Holiday World & Splashin' Safari Paramount's Kings Island Six Flags New England Anton Schwarzkopf Alton Towers Gargoyles (animated series) Universal Orlando Resort Valleyfair!
