should i buy acura tl read below i heard they have transmission problem the one i am thinking of getting had its transmission changed and it has k on it i love the model you're considering it's a very nice vehicle however certain honda acuras equipped with v s from thru have defective transmissions unfortunately the ' tl is on the list honda claims it's less than of their production run for the models affected the problem seems to be related to defective nd rd gear clutch packs and perhaps other internals to their automatic transmissions the problem was serious enough that honda caved in to a class action lawsuit that affords owners of affected vehicles a warranty extension to k miles you might check this out on the honda website to make sure that their extended warranty covers non original owners the main reason why it might make sense to not buy the car is that the transmisson installed to the car you're thinking about is likely a rebuilt one typically they only carry a one yr warranty and it's quite possible that it too suffers from the same 'potential' problems that the original transmission failed from that is you run an elevated risk of facing future transmission problems with that car you could be looking at k in service costs if it should fail  Motorcycle Manual transmission Honda Warranty De Lorean DMC-12 Automobile Automatic transmission Toyota Prius Transmission (mechanics) Hybrid vehicle Honda NSX Cadillac Acura TL Bluetooth Acura Integra (North America) Honda B engine Liability insurance Yugo Battery electric vehicle IPod Acura BMW Acura RL Differential (mechanics) Mazda Miata Audi Chevrolet Corvair Rear wheel drive Public transport Toyota Motor Corporation Locomotive Honda Civic Auto insurance Toyota Camry Turbo-Hydramatic Ford Motor Company Hydrogen vehicle Dodge Neon Acura MDX Porsche 911 Panzer I T-34 Insurance Honda Insight Car and Driver Ten Best All-terrain vehicle Acura RSX Motor oil Truck Headlight Hyundai Motor Company Capitalism Cable television Four wheel drive Tram Toyota Celica AvtoVAZ Best Buy Pimp My Ride Mazda RX-7 Acura TSX Taxicab Honda Ascot Wind turbine Product liability Grey market Docklands Light Railway Prisoner's dilemma Road-rule enforcement camera Panzer II Rapid transit Toronto Streetcar System Automatic number plate recognition E85 Mercedes-Benz C-Class XM Satellite Radio Copyleft Test plan Holden Camira Semi-automatic transmission Alternators Hybrid Synergy Drive German car number plates Supercar Hyundai Motor Group R46 (New York City Subway car) Fuel cell Auto racing Honda Jazz Toyota Corolla Chevrolet Camaro Tank Grand Theft Auto III
