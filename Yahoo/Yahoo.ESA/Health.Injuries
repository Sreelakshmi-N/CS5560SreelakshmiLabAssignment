will i need an mri ok whenever i go to cheerleading and work on my tumbling skills my wrist starts to hurt really bad and i stretch it really good before i tumble and i stretch it after and during but it still kills if the doctor says i need an x ray will it be a mri or a regular x ray i really dont want a mri but i really dont even know if i need to go to the doctors becuase my coach never said i had to so maybe i will just take it easy and see if it still hurts after a few more practices i will wear a wrist brace for now you should have your parents take you to see an orthopedic doctor and have the wrist examined and have an x ray taken you need to have the x ray looked at by a qualified person not a chiropractor most likely you are just placing too much stress on the wrist b c the muscles in your arm are weak and not taking enough of the force you should get a referral for physical therapy to strengthen the muscles in your arm  Carpal tunnel syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chiropractic Professional wrestling holds Urinary incontinence Repetitive strain injury Physical examination Cheerleading Post Polio syndrome Fencing Weight training Multiple sclerosis Fecal incontinence Rotator cuff tear Medicine Cardiac stress test Massage Osteopathy Physician Volleyball First aid Syringomyelia Muscular dystrophy Aikido Spanking Tai Chi Chuan Motor neurone disease Physical therapy Orthodontics Traumatic brain injury Milton H.

what does it mean when one of your eyes goes kinda fuzzy this happend months ago and it is doing it again you know when you stare at a bright light and then look away aand you can still see the light well that is gappening w out staring at any lights and it hurts really bad has any one has this before or knows anything about it its just my left eye last time is was the feft it got so bad i had to go home from school times over two weeks we went to a docter but they did not say anything help please not being a doctor i can't tell you what it means but i can tell you about something that i suffer from which may be a starting point for you about a year ago i suddenly noticed a sort of fuzziness out of one eye it started as a small spot in my visual field and then it grew and grew after about or minutes it went away but it terrified me it was fuzzy but there were also really really bright lights and strange shapes and no matter where i looked or whether i shut my eyes or not made no difference a couple of weeks later it happened again out of nowhere then maybe nothing for several months and then it happened again i went to the doctor and he confirmed that i was experiencing migraine aura my doctor recognised it immediately because he suffers from it too i have no pain with it but apparently that is rare for most people who have the condition it is accompanied by or it immediately precedes a severe migraine my doctor says he has to take painkillers and immediately go and lie down in a quiet room in the dark until it passes there is no treatment as far as i am aware thankfully i don't suffer any pain at all with it i just have to pull over if i'm driving for example until it passes i still get it every now and then and it is not always the same eye though mostly the same one months could pass with nothing and then suddenly i get it three days running anyway i am not saying that you have migraine aura but i guess it's a possibility the weird visual disturbance accompanied by bad pain certainly fits the bill there's loads of info on the net about the subject i'd look it up and see whether it sounds familiar and visit a doctor again and ask them to consider whether you might be suffering from this condition  Migraine Shaggy dog story Eye Cluster headache Out-of-body experience The Parting of the Ways Solar eclipse The Shining (film) Color blindness Triage Epilepsy Social rule Hal Trosky Sin City G-Man (Half-Life) Headache Bad Wolf Chronic fatigue syndrome Floater Equine conformation Father's Day (Doctor Who) Clinical depression Miss Saigon Autism Urinary incontinence Miscarriage Opportunity rover Scenes from a Memory Breastfeeding USS Tunny (SS-282) Pain Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Hypnosis Theory of conduct New York Giants Rose (Doctor Who) Mothman Pittsburgh Steelers Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Mental Health Act 1983 Cephalic disorder Super Bowl XXVII Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Piccolo Junior Saga Jon Secada The Keeper of Traken Doctor Strange Decompression sickness Boom Town (Doctor Who) The Empty Child Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Sydney Riot of 1879 Retina Dyslexia Multiple chemical sensitivity Anorexia nervosa Sunglasses Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Autostereogram Mountaineering The X-Files (season 1) Blonde on Blonde Fitz Hugh Ludlow Seizure Open cluster TARDIS Traumatic incident reduction Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Blood on the Tracks Narcissism She Loves You Radiation therapy Stuttering The End of the World (Doctor Who) Stereoscopy Scientology beliefs and practices Transactional analysis 1957 World Series Tank Mount Pinatubo Controversies in autism Stroke Childbirth Chlorpromazine San Francisco 49ers Sant Thakar Singh Astronomy on Mars I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue The Amber Spyglass Hubble Space Telescope Apparent magnitude Ben Johnson (athlete)

how does ultra sound help in healing a broken bone i am currently in physical therapy after breaking my foot in two areas earlier this summer now able to walk on it again i have only lost of the use of my foot following the break fortunately but i am wondering how the ultra sound helps in the healing of the broken bones there is limited evidence to support that ultrasound helps broken bones heal the evidence that has been presented is weak at best but theoretically it stimulates angiogenesis or formation of new blood vessles which help infiltrate the bone to stimulate the deposition of new bone in fact the use of ultrasound at all have very little evidence to support it's use i think it does have potential benefits just that the experiments that have been done so far are poor furthermore i do not think that the mechanisms of how it works are fully understood  Prostate cancer Cancer Medical ultrasonography Wound healing phases Ultrasound Angiogenesis Growth hormone treatment Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Atherosclerosis Puberty Chiropractic Massage Urinary incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Equine conformation Traditional Chinese medicine Traumatic brain injury Reflexology Multiple sclerosis Electroconvulsive therapy Cryptorchidism Medicine Homeopathy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Stem cell Growth factor Clinical depression Breast cancer Orgasm Gravis Ultrasound Metastasis Radiology Crucifixion IgA nephropathy Magnet therapy Stroke Flood geology Chronic fatigue syndrome Bone Reparative therapy Osteoarthritis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Tobacco smoking Myocardial infarction Bone fracture Hip fracture Growth hormone deficiency Xenomorph Chemotherapy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tyrannosaurus rex Supernatural Long-term potentiation Obstetrics Alternative medicine Brain-computer interface Radiation therapy Bone marrow transplant Orthopedic surgery Growth hormone Vitamin C Evolution Turner syndrome Acute respiratory distress syndrome Weight training Dinosaur Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Childbirth Pain Multiple myeloma Hypnosis Supersymmetry Testosterone Dyslexia Neuro-linguistic programming Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Hydrochloric acid Rush (band) Coeliac disease Ventricular fibrillation Anabolic steroid Decompression sickness Mastocytosis Human adaptation to space Evidence of evolution Pterosaur Francis Crick General relativity Asthma Minimum wage Hypertension Narcolepsy Quantum mechanics Cirrhosis Leukemia Wood

laser surgey for ingrown toenails i have to get this done and im scared how the doctor is going to do it he said that he has to take the roots out but how help me i've had that done except with chemicals instead of a laser and it's not as bad as you think depending on how bad your ingrown toenail is he may be taking out the whole nail or just the edge but either way you really can't tell any of the nail is missing after it's done and has healed the doctor will numb your toe and then cut out the part of your nail that's causing problems since you'll be numb this won't hurt but it will sound like a nail clipper then the laser will be used to permanently burn out the root of your nail which will prevent it from ever growing back after it's done take some tylenol for the pain don't do advil as that will make you bleed more and follow your doctor's instructions you'll probably have to leave the bandages on it for hours and afterwards soak it in water with epsom salt mixed in a few times a day unless your doctor tells you differently put neosporin or similar products on it frequently to prevent infections it is kind of scary to think about having your toenail removed but once it's done you'll realize it wasn't such a big deal after all  Nail (anatomy) Nail disease Callus Wound Manicure Pedicure Nine Inch Nails Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Textile manufacturing Milton H.

can a dislocated can that happen fractured rib be healed and if it can be healed what do you suggest are the procedures to heal it can the person live as normal as before can the injury be caused by a car accident it can be caused by a car accident and many others my husband injured his ribs just by playing golf obsessively if its fractured it can heal by itself if you're still in the growing stage it heals faster this can heal by bed rest do not bear weights limited movements that involve the ribs laughing pushing pulling turning bending etc support the affected area if you need to cough or sneeze if your ribs are dislocated it depends on how severe the dislocation is if its minor dislocation it can heal following the above accompanied by pain management if its severely dislocated it might need surgical intervention yes the person can go back to his her normal activity after the fracture has completely healed but you will need an md's clearance for this they might need to take x rays to verify that the bone has completely healed so that you can move around without restrictions if you're older and you got a bone injury healing takes a while or sometimes it does not heal without surgical intervention  Bone fracture Equine conformation Hip fracture Urinary incontinence Traumatic brain injury Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome First aid Motorcycle helmet Penis Stress fracture Rib Scar Weight training Triage Childbirth Boxing Orthopedic surgery Intracranial pressure Chiropractic Emergency department Tuberculosis Osteoporosis Medicine Paget's disease of bone Replacement joint Stroke Breech birth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Puberty Intersex surgery Radiation therapy Swimming Domestic rabbit Wound healing phases Wound Humerus Professional wrestling holds Bruise Milton H.

how do i escape a really bad kink in the neck yesterday i got this bad kink in my neck and i couldn't even move my neck cause it hurt is there any exercises to get rid of it what you seem to be describing is what is known as a torticollis or wry neck often from sleeping in a poor position poor sitting position at computer etc assuming you have no bad symptoms loss of power sensation to your upper limbs etc then these things often resolve of their own accord within a few days you can take some simple analgesia use deep heat compresses or hot bath and try to relax to reduce the tension in your neck you can move your neck to the limits of the pain but do not force anything as it will only get worse slow movements in the opposite direction to the kink and also in a circular motion at the end of the day it will still take a few days to resolve but be patient  Equine conformation Massage Urinary incontinence Carpal tunnel syndrome Repetitive strain injury Chronic fatigue syndrome Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Pain Weight training Out-of-body experience First aid Myocardial infarction Epidural Professional wrestling holds Migraine Fibromyalgia Torticollis Glossary of partner dance terms Traumatic brain injury Tai Chi Chuan Hypnosis Stroke Balance disorder Alexander Technique Osteoarthritis Diving Poliomyelitis Medicine Childbirth Cancer Rheumatoid arthritis Sleep apnea Professional wrestling throws Multiple sclerosis Hyperthermia Narcolepsy Prostate cancer Angina Restless legs syndrome Anatomical terms of location Trumpet Professional wrestling slang Analgesic Radiation therapy Insomnia Euthanasia Snake Breastfeeding Electromagnetic field Apoplexy Essential tremor Swingout Seismic retrofit Reflexology Back pain Diving suit Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Thoracic outlet syndrome The Kinks Tension headache Milton H.

glenoid labrum what are the odds that i am suffering from a tear in my right glenoid labrum i recently july th injured my right shoulder and it was diagnosed as an a c sprain and a shoulder contusion but i am slowly regaining my range of motion and am now suffering from pain in the back of my shoulder rather than my a c joint like i have in the past i go back in weeks for another re evaluation of my shoulder and it will be determined there if i should go get an mri for the tendons my shoulder is also clicking popping more than it has in the past what are you takes on this it feels a whole lot more stable then it did in the beginning though i still can barely hold lift objects in that arm without it hurting and i can feel it start to pull down though i'm not sure if that's from my a c joint or not i originally landed on it playing soccer i am a goalie and it landed underneath me more than it normally does when i dive i think there is a decent chance you have a tear in the labrum considering the symptoms you describe the pain in the back of the shoulder may be from tightness in the infraspinatus muscle or in the posterior shoulder capsule does your shoulder feel unstable if so that is another good indicator of a tear in the labrum like the other person said tears in the labrum dont always appear on the mri how did you initially injur the shoulder that is another way that helps determine whether you may have a tear good luck with that  Scapula Humerus Supraspinatus muscle Professional wrestling holds Traumatic brain injury Shoulder Aortic dissection Rotator cuff tear Diving Weight training Professional wrestling throws Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Myocardial infarction Iliotibial band syndrome Anterior cruciate ligament Prostate cancer Repetitive strain injury Decompression sickness Multiple sclerosis Pain Stroke Tetrapod Syringomyelia Bipolar disorder Osteoarthritis Elbow-joint Anatomical terms of location Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Cardiac stress test Spanking Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Suplex Breaststroke Arm Professional wrestling slang Evidence of evolution Professional wrestling attacks Post Polio syndrome Bruise Adult attention-deficit disorder Internal ballistics Babe Ruth Chronic fatigue syndrome Hip (anatomy) Drowning Knife Retinal detachment Butterfly stroke Autism Eye Paget's disease of bone Rugby union Tenshinhan Water polo Magnetic resonance imaging Swimming New York Giants Cerebellum Backstroke Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Breast cancer Massage Troy Glaus Boxing Cephalic disorder Chris Kanyon Casualty lifting First aid Cancer Breastfeeding Clinical depression Kodocha Gundam W G-Unit: Last Outpost Pneumonia Fibromyalgia Vegeta Stinger (medicine) Scientology beliefs and practices Angina Kurt Angle Professional wrestling aerial techniques Leon White Columbine High School massacre Ultimate (sport) Borderline personality disorder Professional wrestling Endometriosis The Contender (television series) Archery Traumatic incident reduction Norway national football team History of brain imaging Fecal incontinence Autopsy Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis

hamstring problems ok i was playing in a soccer game and it was fine till after the game then my hamstring started hurting i jsut thought it was sore so i just stretched but now it still hurts and its been months how am i going to get rid of it soccer season starts in one month sounds like you may have tore your hamstring you have created scar tissue in your hamstring that is why you have not been doing better actually when you tear your hamstring you should not stretch this is one thing that a lot of people do wrong put it this way if you tore something would you actually want to stretch it to make it tear more what you need to do now is get in with a physical therapist that deals with athletes and does myofascial release or an active release provider activerelease com you need someone to get in there and tear up that scar tissue and let it heal the right way you could actually pull this off before the beginning of your season if you find the right person to work on you hope this helps and good luck  Massage Ken Griffey, Jr. The Contender (television series) Red Hot Chili Peppers Anterior cruciate ligament Running Andr__s Galarraga Weight training Social rule Babe Ruth Scar Roger Clemens Stretching Carpal tunnel syndrome Ben Johnson (athlete) Piccolo Junior Saga Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Detroit Tigers Cork City F.C.

about how long do i have to wear a cast for a fractured ankle i have broken my left ankle bones in the ankle by falling off a horse about weeks ago i already had a surgery to put screws and a metal plate to hold the bones in the ankle together i was just wondering about how long people with simmilar situation have to wear the cast on before moving on to the walking boots your ortho and current physical therapist would have the best answer for you since they know your case if your talking about a tibula fibula injury that usually takes about to weeks depending on severity of the fx and bone quality the small bones of your foot are a nuisance and can take longer to heal because of the loading pressures on your feet some orthos orthopedic surgeon would have you in a walking boot if your fx was stable and secured with hardware as you mentioned you need to ask your doctor  Orthopedic surgery Bone fracture Hip fracture Foot Equine conformation Kurt Angle Medicine Shoe Ceramics Traumatic brain injury Anterior cruciate ligament Carpal tunnel syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Land mine Aerial (dance move) Paget's disease of bone Jessica Lynch Snowboard Urinary incontinence Tattoo High-heeled shoe Podiatrist Triage Stomach cancer Casting Decompression sickness Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Bruise Spanking Shawn Michaels Casualty lifting Diving suit Earring Scar Replacement joint Physical examination Drill bit Weight training Chris Candito Cerebral palsy 2004 American League Championship Series Social rule Prostate cancer Anatomical terms of location Hip replacement Osteoporosis Tourniquet Dragon Booster Glossary of climbing terms Horse Mattress Terrell Owens Leon White Scoliosis Motorcycle helmet Iliotibial band syndrome Traditional Chinese medicine The Dalek Invasion of Earth Baseball Immortality Tire Futurama (TV series - season 4) Fracture Rail tracks Terminal ballistics Emergency department Horseshoe Orthodontics Osteoarthritis Exoskeleton Osteogenesis imperfecta Human adaptation to space Alexander Technique Softball Hydrogen Stereoscopy Mois__s Alou Milton H.

please please help self injury i asked another question earlier about how to minimize scarring because i self harmed for the first time today but now im realy worried because one of the cuts looks like a wound and it wont close i can see pink flesh do you think i need stitches also other cuts that arnt too bad have closed up but there is almost a blood colour forming under the skin thats spreading what should i do and yes i am going to get help from a psychologist moro but right now i need to know what this is and how to stop it i'm really scared the other cuts i made today are closing and the reason i did this today is because i saw the man who sexually abused me for my whole child hood and freaked out so shut your fucking mouth the first guy who answered and the problem wasnt my daddy didnt hug me enough my daddy hugged me too much fuck you i hun believe that all these people telling you that it is stupid to self injure are insecure about themselves they probably haven't been through the same shit that you have in your past they don't understand i'll insert a favorite quote of mine here to those who know no explanation needed to those who don't no explanation possible you can get through this i believe in you i am here for you and you know i always am and will be as much as i possibly can if you want to play doctor and stitch this up yourself wait i think i already told you this but anyways lol clean it up with some kind of antiseptic wash try to be careful with the other wounds around that area see if you can close it up and get it to stay closed and if it gets any worse try to find a way to see a doctor whether you have to sneak out or whatever you have to do if you try to heal it yourself it probably is possible but will probably leave a keloid scar whereas a scar from stitches will probably be much less visible in the future but requires a visit to the emergency room in the end it's all up to you remember you are in control in life and you have people me out there that believe in you i hope you find my answer helpful and my addy is alwaysashley if you'd like to im me hugs hang in there you'll be okay  Scar Scarification The Shining (film) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Father's Day (Doctor Who) Body piercing Fecal incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Boom Town (Doctor Who) Self-harm Social rule Triage Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Empty Child Keloid Theory of conduct Sexual orientation Ex-gay Milton H.

sprained knee questions torn meniscus i have never had any problems with my knees today while playing basketball i was sprinting towards the guy with the ball in an attempt to steal it he made a sudden move as i glided in on my approach and i 'decelerated' as soon as i did this i heard a pop and i went down to the ground the pain was not nearly as bad as a sprained ankle i can walk on it put all my weight on my foot with the hurt knee stretch my leg out completely to where the knee is locked and there is no pain when i massage my knee i cannot walk nearly as good as i regularly can i'd say about the most pain i get is when i bring my heal to my butt what exercises can i do to help it how long until i fully recover any suggestions at all uh that sounds like a torn acl to me have a doctor perform an anterior drawers test on your knee if your knee 'gives' then its a probable sign for a torn acl an mri determines the extent of the tear i would not move the leg around until its seen by a doctor you should not hyperextend or hyperflex your knee at the moment because the acl tegether with he pcl is the ligament which protects your knee from forward and backward dislocation  Anterior cruciate ligament Knee Professional wrestling holds Equine conformation Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling attacks Professional wrestling throws Diving Volleyball Orthopedic surgery Weight training Anatomical terms of location Tibia Professional wrestling aerial techniques Breaststroke Marching band Glossary of ballet terms Skateboarding trick Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Osteoarthritis Fast bowling Horizontal bar American football Pain Childbirth Mois__s Alou Swimming Massage Batting (cricket) Swingout Nen__ Casualty lifting High-heeled shoe Aortic dissection The Dalek Invasion of Earth Figure skating Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Parade (military) Computer security Babe Ruth Clean and jerk 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand Professional wrestling slang Suplex Laws of cricket Backstroke Shaggy dog story Snowboard Gary Sheffield Mixed martial arts Front crawl Running Myocardial infarction Iliotibial band syndrome Proprioception PRIDE Spanking Baseball Tetrapod Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Paget's disease of bone Pole vault Shawn Michaels National Football League Lore Crash test dummy Breastfeeding Cheerleading Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Professional wrestling Backbreaker Osteopathy Motorcycle helmet Jazz dance moves Glossary of partner dance terms Carpal tunnel syndrome Chiropractic Andr__s Galarraga Replacement joint Milton H.

knee injury ok so i just started pt for my knee i injured it back in june and the ortho just refered me to pt and i had my rd session today the therapist had me doing wall slides this is where u stand with ur feet shoulder width apart and slide down the wall so that ur knee is bent at about degrees or as far as u can go with out pain so i do this and on the way back up i feel kind of a grinding and then pain on the front and inside of my knee it wasnt so bad so i pushed on and continued with the set after the therapist did ultrasound message and iced my knee anyway when i got home i noticed that my knee was still hurting so i iced it my question is could i have reinjured my knee or was the pain caused because i have been in an immobolizer since the injury and haven't bent my knee that far also if pt doesn't help what will be the next step that the dr will take any help would be great the initial injury was a partial mcl tear thanks to all who have answered so far today at thereapy before i began the exercises the therapist stretched my knee out a bit but while soing the wall slides my knee still made that sort of pop and grind noises and then tonight when i got home my knee felt a little loose which it hasn't felt that way since i first injured my knee the pain is same however as always no increase but no change either if any one else has any thoughts that would be great thanks your quads and your knee are not used to such extreme exercises since you have been in the immoblizer if wall slides hurt don't do as far down go down only to where you feel no pain these should become less painful as time goes on what was your injury i don't know what to tell you the doctor might do next if i don't know what your injury was probably surgery but like i said i don't know what your injury is if you e mail me maybe i can help some more  Equine conformation Professional wrestling holds Aerial (dance move) Iliotibial band syndrome Knee Diving Volleyball Professional wrestling attacks Skateboarding trick Backstroke Glossary of ballet terms Swingout Massage Fecal incontinence Repetitive strain injury Anterior cruciate ligament Casualty lifting Breaststroke Tai Chi Chuan Weight training Charleston (dance move) Fast bowling Pain Swimming Carpal tunnel syndrome Glossary of climbing terms Babe Ruth Horizontal bar Professional wrestling aerial techniques Spanking Milton H.

a question about a broken toe well i got the pin outa my toe a few weeks ago the toe bent into some wierd position and they had to put a pin in to hold it straight and now i gota practice walkin again im not in therapy and they told me i can do it on my own how often should i practice and how greetings i would start by walking on soft carpets in the house but make sure you stretch your feet and toes before you do or you might wind up with cramps and spasms probably a good stretch for you would be sitting on a chair and pointing your feet out straight toes out straight like you would see on a ballet dancer but you'd be sitting and your legs straight not touching the floor doing tip toes would help too like standing for seconds then down up and doing maybe reps make sure you have a good comfy sneaker to walk in then after you can do it comfortably inside start outside just don't overdo it and walk miles or something  Professional wrestling holds Glossary of ballet terms Aerial (dance move) Swingout Skateboarding trick Shoe Glossary of partner dance terms Diving Backstroke Figure skating Irish dance Pointe shoes Milton H.

boyfriend broke my rib my boyfriend and i were arguing and he pushed me back and it's hard to describe kneeled knelt on my body so his knees were a bit lower than my collarbone i heard a crack which is understandable as his whole body weight was on me and the next day a lump came up which was sooo painful i couldn't lift my arm or anything and it went through to my back weeks later its a bit better but still very sore and the lump is still there does this sound like a broken rib i can't leave him i love him the women with abusive men all love them and most leave them and go back over and over i suppose it was all your fault for not loving him enough to do just what he wanted wasn't it hint he has just what he wants a victim i hope you wake up before you don't wake up some morning go to the hospital and tell them exactly what happened and i'll bet anyone checking this post that she won't do it why because dying is easier than admitting she made a mistake my daughter survived somehow not all do  Professional wrestling holds Equine conformation Professional wrestling throws Jon Secada EastEnders Social rule The Shining (film) Knots Landing Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Ozzy Osbourne Autopsy Piledriver (professional wrestling) Boxing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Roswell UFO incident Blood on the Tracks Aerial (dance move) StarCraft: Uprising Shaggy dog story Evel Knievel Humphrey Bogart Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Casualty lifting Ron and Fez Skateboarding trick Paul Is Dead The Lovely Bones Weight training Babe Ruth Neighbours Kodocha Breastfeeding First aid Reaction to the assassination of John F.

i have achy pain in my ankle after spraining it in october last year no swelling couldn't put weight on it without shooting pains didn't get it checked out can't go iceskating because of worry of redoing the injury and this time breaking a bone omg ur story souend eactally like what i did to my ankle when i was a senior in high school i was a cheerleading practice and we were doing jump drills well lets just say that when i landed my jump my ankle rolled inwards and i felt and heard a very audible pop i sat out for a bit of practice with ice on my ankle and refused to be seen by the school sports med specialist continued practice cause i felt no pain even though origanally the pain was excruciating when i got home i had like hour before my all star team had practice so i iced my ankle and taped it up for practice went to practice did everything went home iced it again when i got up for school the next morning i looked as though a had a softball in my ankle and could hardly put any weight on it so i wraped it and went ahead to school i never went to the dr for two reasons i'm stubborn and stupid my allstar team had nationals that weekend and i wasnt going to miss it the reason i never went after was because i felt stupid for waiting so long anyway it healed i guess but ever since then i've been afraid to whip my jumps in fear of reinjuring my ankle and i too have the achy pains in my ankle at times and sometimes for now reason at all my ankle will sortof give out i say you should go iceskating again and just wear a brace on your ankle for support and if anything does happen then go get it checked out this time you can't change what u did in the past by why should it prohibit your future best of luck  Kurt Angle Cheerleading Equine conformation Milton H.

possible pulled ligament okay i think i might have pulled a ligament behind my knee of my left leg where i work i lift lbs sometimes up some stairs anywho my knee didn't bother me at work wednesday evening after work i got up from laying on the couch and went to bend my knee the back of it hurt only when i was bending it though i borrowed a knee brace from my friend and wore it to work yesterday i tried to keep as much pressure off my leg as i could when lifting things i took my brace off and it still hurt to bend it so i took the advice of a coworker and bought an ice pack and elevated my leg with ice underneath it all night maybe i shouldn't have done it that long also i bought my own leg brace anyways i wore the brace again today again trying not to put too much pressure on my leg i also tried some icy hot on the back of my knee at break time it doesn't hurt when i walk but when i bend my knee so far it hurts sometimes not each time i bend itthe back of my knee only so does this sound like a pulled ligament it hurts but it's not crying pain more annoying pain than anything i had broken my left thigh bone ten years ago and had a metal plate put in there i was on crutches for about months and it seems like that leg has always been more stiff since then is there anything else i can do i was thinking about seeing a doctor but if it's just a pulled ligament i don't think there's much more they can do i was going to clean a friend's house today but i had it rescheduled for sunday so that i could stay off of my leg for the rest of today and tomorrow sorry for it being so long any advice is appreciated if it bothers you more than a couple more days then you should make an appointment to see a doctor if you can go directly to the orthopedic doc its sorta hard to give you an idea of the problem b c your signs and symptoms dont scream out thing it could be a meniscus tear could be a bakers cyst could be strain to one of the muscles that attach in the back of the knee have a qualified professional examine you to make sure its nothing serious  Equine conformation Professional wrestling holds Knee Diving Anterior cruciate ligament Carpal tunnel syndrome Professional wrestling throws Shaggy dog story Osteoarthritis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) Glossary of climbing terms Tetrapod Professional wrestling attacks Orthopedic surgery Jam (TV series) Babe Ruth Weight training Strap-on dildo Powerbomb Piledriver (professional wrestling) Dog training Figure skating Scoliosis Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Iliotibial band syndrome Fecal incontinence Mattress EastEnders Dental brace Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Dalek Invasion of Earth Piccolo Junior Saga Urinary incontinence Breaststroke Hip fracture Drill bit Hal Trosky Knots Landing Scapula Tibia Jackass: The Movie Childbirth Chair The Inside Backstroke Recumbent bicycle Decompression sickness Denis Law Paget's disease of bone Milton H.

my mom said my leg looks swollen i broke my leg about years ago every now and then it hurts but this is the first time my mom's said that it looks swollen sort of related but if you broke your leg when you were ten is that leg going to grow slower than the unbroken one my mom's trying to figure out why my walk is weird she's considering taking me to the doctor or back to my physical therapist thanks if you broke your leg years ago maybe it did not heal right i have heard of situations where the leg was not healing right and the doctor had to break it again and then re set the leg so the leg could heal properly maybe this is the case with you your mom is absolutely right in taking you to the doctor you need to get an x ray and have the doctor look at your leg immediately he will then decide if you need to see the physical therapist or maybe have an operation to correct it i personally think the leg did not heal properly when you broke it about years ago and since you were still growing the leg did not grow properly along with you i think that maybe you should see an orthopedic doctor please go as soon as possible and don't be scare i believe that this can be corrected i wish you the best of luck  Hip fracture Piccolo Junior Saga Weight training Medicine Orthopedic surgery Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Diving Shaggy dog story Spina bifida Massage Aerial (dance move) Great Teacher Onizuka Avenue Q Iliotibial band syndrome Milton H.

how can i get a condom out of my vagina please dont report this is serious please dont report me last night i had sex and the condom slipped off well when we realized that the condom slipped off we thought it was on the ground and just continued without well when we were finished we searched around for it and then i thought it was in my vagina well i had my sister check it and is in there but we cant get it out anybody ever had this problem how did u get it out please go to the gynocologist or if you don't have one your family doctor i have never personally had it happen but smack the guy who did that because the base of the condom should be held during the removal of the p nis from the v gina and he should've known that if he didn't know that then he is too immature young to be having sex in the first place if the condom was in your v ginal canal then there is a possibility that the s men released in the condom may have leaked out of the condom into your v ginal canal if a condom is your only method of birth control then you should see your health care provider to receive the emergency contraception pill the emergency contraceptive pills ecp are estrogen and or progestin compound that can decrease the chances of pregnancy after unprotected intercourse ecp is most effective soon after unprotected sex and is of no less if started after hours but can still be effective for up to days after unprotected sex best of luck  Emergency contraception Oral contraceptive Condom Birth control Fertility awareness Safe sex Menstrual cycle Intrauterine device Sex education Oral sex Anal sex Sexual intercourse Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Menstrual cup Endometriosis AIDS Hormone replacement therapy Herpes simplex virus Sexual abstinence Depo Provera Urinary incontinence Androgen insensitivity syndrome Harm reduction AIDS pandemic Teenage pregnancy Gonorrhoea Sex toy Cervical cap Strap-on dildo Rape Abortion debate Sexual revolution Barebacking Masturbation Diaphragm (contraceptive) Progesterone Sexual dysfunction Gay bathhouse History of intersex surgery Prolactinoma Pornographic movie Crystal methamphetamine and sex Cancer Vagina Obstetrics Fecal incontinence Childbirth Coitus interruptus Abortion Hypertension Progesterone only pill Unsafe sexual practices Human sexual behavior In vitro fertilisation Personal lubricant Humanae Vitae Douche Twin Apollo 8 Caffeine Medical analysis of circumcision Prostitution Gliding action Herbert Garrison Acne Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Vagina dentata Estrogen Breast Biology and sexual orientation Genital wart Prostate cancer Ectopic pregnancy Human sexuality Migraine Margaret Sanger Cervical cancer Triage AIDS in Africa Orgasm Lawrence v.

should i go to the doctors or er the day before yesterday in the pool i think i twisted my ankle but when i got out it just felt weak but didnt hurt yesterday i woke up and it hurt to walk and it was swollen but no bruising so my mom said to put my ankle support on and carried on limping today i have woken up and it had swollen again and i can barely walk without my ankle support and is painful to walk even with my ankle support on so i have iced it and the swelling has gone down but it feels like its getting worse should i go to the doctors or er or just leave it to heal on its own by the way i'm mary xxx hi mary it sounds as though there is a strong possibility your ankle has a fracture a fracture is damage to a bone it could be just cracked but a crack is still a fracture if it is fractured it will usually take a while for bruising to appear and you will probably be in too much pain to leave ice on it to be certain your doctor needs an x ray of you ankle he can see the problem clearly if it's the bone that's injured if your ankle is only sprained the following treatments should have helped rest stay off it as much as possible ice use cold packs to reduce the swelling compression wrap a rollar bandage around it for support elevation keep it up and rested the more your feet are low the more gravity will send blood and swelling there and increase the pain  Bruise Equine conformation Hip fracture Bone fracture Professional wrestling holds Carpal tunnel syndrome Traumatic brain injury First aid Stomach cancer Prostate cancer Pain Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Hiking Chronic fatigue syndrome Osteoarthritis Intracranial pressure Spanking Kurt Angle High-heeled shoe Weight training Penis Cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Myocardial infarction Aerial (dance move) Jessica Lynch Osteoporosis Wound Cocaine Stress fracture Paget's disease of bone Tattoo Cellulitis Diablo II Items in the Metroid series Anterior cruciate ligament Naruto jutsu Professional wrestling slang Psoriasis Yosemite National Park Chiropractic Multiple myeloma Radiation therapy Human adaptation to space Physical examination Knife Poker jargon The Dalek Invasion of Earth Snakebite (bite) Decompression sickness Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Avalanche Traditional Chinese medicine Drowning Babe Ruth Foot Leukemia Andr__ the Giant Intravenous therapy Inflammation Triage Skull fracture Tobacco smoking Pope John Paul I Group A streptococcal infection Blood (computer game) Hydrotherapy Seismic retrofit Diabetic retinopathy Obstetrics Dairy Harp Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Urinary incontinence Suplex Diabetic neuropathy Self-harm Childbirth Iliotibial band syndrome Platypus Hemorrhoid Hal Trosky Post Polio syndrome James Augustus Grant Alternative medicine Poliomyelitis Fracture 21st Century Fox The Shining (film) Massage

is my leg dislocated i did hurdles in track a few months ago and i hurt my leg i felt it pop and i was in pain i didnt think i dislocated it because i played football a while before that and it popped just like it did and i only bothered me for a day or then the pain left but now a few months past the hurdle injury it is really starting to feel awkward when i walk so is it dislocated or wat if your hip was dislocated you wouldn't be walking at all it sounds like your hip is not lining up with the pelvis properly this can cause pain grinding popping or clicking unfortunately this is nothing you can fix yourself i would recommend you mention this to your chiropractor i assume you have one because you play football before football practice starts up a good chiropractor will be able to realign your pelvis so that the hip lines up properly if this goes uncorrected it can develop into arthritis later in life good luck and do something about this now it won't go away on its own  Equine conformation Carpal tunnel syndrome Aerial (dance move) Paget's disease of bone Pelvis Diving Hip fracture American football Childbirth Weight training Dyspareunia Bryan Robson Iliotibial band syndrome Orthopedic surgery Denis Law Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jack Charlton Hurdling Breech birth Contortion Casualty lifting Repetitive strain injury New England Patriots The Shining (film) Double bass 1957 World Series Eddie Guerrero Osteopathy Journey (band) Satchel Paige Music genre Kodocha Bone fracture Cincinnati Bengals Laws of cricket Professional wrestling attacks 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand Olympic medalists in athletics (men) Fanny Blankers-Koen Nine Inch Nails Norway national football team Hip hop rivalries Dog training Back pain Pain Osteoarthritis Renaldo Nehemiah Football (soccer) Piccolo Junior Saga Ja Rule Brian Close Subluxation Indian English Rod Stewart Van Halen Sydney Riot of 1879 Marching band Hip hop culture Pet Sounds Hip dysplasia Social rule FA Cup Dundee United F.C.
