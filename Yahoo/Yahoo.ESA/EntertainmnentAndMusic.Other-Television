big brother live why do the producers cut out so much of the audio all the time i cant stand big brother live it seems you get about of the time where they are talking and where you hear background noise birds whistling plane flying overhead etc does anyone know why they cut out so much it cant just be swearing as they do this after watershed where swearing shouldnt matter they cant be talking so much about brand names and things too that i guess is another reason why big bro would choose to block the sound any ideas think you will find it has something to do with politics basically if they say anything which can be deemed as offensive to people no matter how trivial they are not allowed to air it if they were to say the sky is blue someone would complain and say its not thats how i see it anyway  Super Mario Bros. 3 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Hearing impairment Sampling (music) Mario Super Mario Bros.

i've never seen er i've never seen any episodes of er am i missing anything i have never seen an episode of miami vice survivor the trump reality show american idol grey's anatomy am i missing anything er was great early in its run then the original cast kept leaving and they kept putting in new characters that weren't as compelling complex i finally gave up on it when they turned carter into a saint there were occasional episodes that were good in the later seasons but overall i'd say you aren't missing much by not watching it i've never seen miami vice so i cannot comment on that the survivor episodes i've seen were sort of stupid and not that interesting to me but i know others love the show i especially think that it has gone past its prime because the people know what they are getting into and know how to manipulate the game also they've resorted to gimmicks like the race season i also found the episodes of the apprentice that i watched to be silly i thought the challenges were ill conceived and the 'firings' were not always commensurate with the actions and results in said challenges plus the show has the disadvantage of having donald trump being a huge part and i find him to be an arrogant blow hard i think american idol is way overrated first off they spend so much time on the humiliation episodes i just don't feel comfortable with a show that takes such delight in making fun of people for entertainment then people who have not so much talent slip through because of people voting for silly reasons sanjaya need i say more also if you look at the winners from every season since the first they were not particularly strong and their albums didn't do all that well i do have to give it credit for discovering some talent mostly in the runners up but i have no desire to watch it grey's anatomy was only so so in the beginning then it found its stride and i thought it was pretty damn good through the second half of the first season and the majority of the second season the third season was not so great though in fact i was really upset with what the writers had done with some of the characters and some of the storylines tptb seem to realize that they were not at their best last season and are promising a return to form next season so i'm willing to try it again and hope for the best of all of the shows on your list that would be my pick for the one to watch  The Apprentice 2 The Amazing Race American Idol The Apprentice The Apprentice 2 candidates Star Trek: Enterprise Blue Heelers The Ashlee Simpson Show Saturday Night Live Knots Landing Donald Trump Whose Line Is It Anyway?
