instead of declawing cats can't you just file their nails down i've always wondered this why do people get their cats declawed when it's painful for the cat when they could just get them filed down or trimmed i'm not a cat person so i don't know so much about them i'm a bird person and with birds you're always supposed to file trim their beaks when they become too long can't you do this with cats jenna it doesn't matter if they put the cats to sleep when they're removed it's still painful for the cat afterwords one of my relatives had a declawed cat mr fancy pants you didn't read my question did you i don't even like cats lol edit oh i meant to say their beaks and nails sorry that woulda bothered me heather r a few days more like a few weeks from what i saw yes you can and it's what i do personally it can be a bit of a hassle and you have to do it once a month or so some people don't feel like taking the time effort to do so alternatively there are claw covers called softpaws that are an acrylic i think cover that slides onto the nail oh and you can also train them to not claw on things i also do that and when i forget to clip their nails it's no biggie in fact i haven't clipped them in about months lol no problems with them clawing anything but their designated scratching post  Nine Inch Nails Pet skunk Ferret Milton H.

my cousins cat keeps randomly getting hair ties and putting them into water toilet bowl water dish any help lol the little thief yes your cousin should put her hair ties where they belong in a closed container inside a drawer of course it sounds like she is like the rest of us who pull them out of our hair and set them to the side wherever we happen to be clearly the kitty likes to play and since the kitty clearly adores your cousin her things are sought out plus hair things are small stretchy bouncy and easy to tote about the whole water thing is just way too funny and i'm betting that the reason the stuff stays in the water is because it puts a damper on the fun of the toy so the cat loses interest but the kitty is always willing to try again to see if there is a new result or put the great toy in a safe place because clearly since there is no way that the kitty wants to dive in and fish out the hair tie then obviously no one else will want to either for the cost of hairties i think your cousin can probably handle this for the few months or year that this will continue and she'll probably talk about it fondly or at least you will for years to come because it it legitimately funny  Poker jargon Hamster Care Bears Cat Garfield Kender Japanese toilet Modem Professional wrestling match types Swimming pool Kimi Finster Shaggy dog story Something Positive Late Night with Conan O'Brien Squidward Tentacles Weebl and Bob Ron and Fez Japanese tea ceremony EastEnders Trailer Park Boys Ranma __ characters Eric Cartman Cruising (maritime) English cricket team Bat Wheel of Fortune Social rule Textile manufacturing Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Fruits Basket Fast bowling Craps Badly Drawn Kitties Salad Fingers Hello Kitty My Little Pony Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Swingout Condom USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) RuneScape quests Funny Farm (comic) Plane (tool) Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Dog training Sinfest Blackadder 2000 Australian Grand Prix Chopsticks Ages of Myst Futurama (TV series - season 2) Sports betting Kodocha M16 (rifle) Girly Toy train Kitty Kelley The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Aladdin (1992 film) Bonus Stage AFI 100 Years series Baccarat 2005 English cricket season Palindrome Naval mine Siphon Grandview, U.S.A.

kitten help almost weeks ago we were given a and week old orphaned kitten to foster he had been fine until last tuesday he suddenly became ill and passed on ever since then i can't stop thinking about how i should have fed him more that morning got around mls of kmr i just assumed he would be okay and since his carrier was next to me for most of the hours between first meal to checkup that he would cry for food like normal when hungry but he hadn't gotten food during the night and his first meal was so small that i doubt he ate enough i asked the vet tech tried going to the vet tues if he would have starved and she said it would take days so not that fast i tried feeding him when i found him weak but he hardly ate i feel so guilty about this now that i can't sleep or eat i hate myself so much the guilt is endless and i just can't stand thinking about how lazy and selfish i was i'm so stupid for doing this the pain is endless someone please help me was the kitten ill before he passed away did you know he was ill or i'm not sure why you feel guilty about this if you had fostered the kitten fed it well but missed feeding it by an extra hour or so that would not have caused the kitten to die if you were consistently missing feedings then yes you may have not given him her the care it needed but it hardly sounds like that sometimes no matter what you do or how hard you try they just don't make it even under the best of circumstances i used to raise cats and once in a great while there would be a runt or one that was having trouble and of course i'd step in to try and save it even when the mom kitty says it's not going to live i'd still try feeding it keeping it warm and clean etc etc it didn't always work and yes sometimes i would wonder if there was something i could have done differently but i knew i did the best i could if you feel you did the best you could under the circumstances then good for you don't let it stop you from trying to foster another kitten it's one of the hardest things to find someone that will take in orphaned kittens so quit beating yourself up over this realize that you were of help to this little guy and go forth and do more good for the kitties of the world the very fact that you feel guilt says you're a good person  Garfield Kitten Guinea pig Fasting Hypoglycemia Phoebe Buffay's songs Shaggy dog story The Amber Spyglass Ron and Fez One Piece minor characters Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Cat Terri Schiavo The Marshall Mathers LP Kodocha Ferret Social rule The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe StarCraft: Hybrid YuYu Hakusho Pet skunk Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pitaten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breastfeeding Poker jargon Knots Landing EastEnders Paul Is Dead Eric Cartman Sin City Futurama (TV series - season 5) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Calvin and Hobbes Characters in the Smurfs One Tree Hill (TV series) Badly Drawn Kitties 2000 Australian Grand Prix Fecal incontinence The Inside Scientology beliefs and practices Anorexia nervosa Piccolo Junior Saga John the Baptist Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Joe DiMaggio The Subtle Knife Jon Secada Marilyn Monroe Days of our Lives Grief Little Britain Characters of Naruto James Hanratty Operation Market Garden Friends Sydney Riot of 1879 Charles Peace Little Shop of Horrors Night (book) Xiaolin Showdown Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Out-of-body experience RuneScape quests Random Harvest Atomic Kitten FoxTrot Textile manufacturing Sant Thakar Singh Johnny Appleseed 613 mitzvot Don Giovanni Mojave people Babe Ruth Trailer Park Boys Full Metal Panic?

i have cats that do not have worms they both have diarrhea vet doesn't know why help please one had it first then the nd one got it a few days later they're getting sick of pumpkin and beginning to protest any suggestions would be appreciated i only feed them their cat food friskies cans and iams bran it's been the same for a few mos maybe i should ask a neighbor if he is feeding them and what the pumpkin is for all animals when they have the runs i take exceptional care of all of my animals so this is very upsetting to me that i don't know the answer ha okay the vet doesn't know why he's done a fecal test for all the little micro bugs and they're clean no changes in food or water lately no changes in environment no outside cats exposure up to date on shots temps are normal hydration is still good so exactly what do you want help with curing the diarrhea seriously you need to find the cause in order to cure it but the pumpkin is a good idea the main thing you want to watch for with diarrhea is dehydration as long as they are drinking and are not dehydrated that's good if they are eating also then that's good too first off did the vet give any antibiotics to the cats for the diarrhea if so get some probiotics and give the cats some of that to help build back up the intestinal tract or you can simply feed them some plain active cultured yogurt it does pretty much the same thing keep them on a bland diet cottage cheese rice boiled chicken you can boil the rice in chicken broth to help them like it g lots of places on the web with suggestions on how to feed a cat for diarrhea but it's basically to feed them very bland foods to quiet the system you can also give them pedialyte i prefer the unflavored variety for children for drinking to help rehydrate them and it will also help replenish some of the lost minerals etc do not give them kaopectate or pepto bismal they are dangerous to your cats quite frankly if your cats are still having a problem with diarrhea in another day or two i would switch vets tho and try someone else there's a reason they have this problem and saying i don't know isn't much help be sure tho to re examine the time prior to their diarrhea for anything that might have caused the diarrhea good luck  Diarrhea Dehydration Ulcerative colitis Stomach cancer Domestic rabbit Chicken Vitamin C Guinea pig Pet skunk Food Cat Dairy Livestock Kitten Veganism Garfield Cholera Hamster Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Coeliac disease Prostate cancer Vegetarianism Raw food diet Escherichia coli O157:H7 Japanese cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Fancy rat Ferret Nutrition Cancer Rehydration Ramen Campylobacteriosis Pneumonia Egg (food) Genetically modified food Peruvian cuisine Tofu Cuisine of Denmark Taboo food and drink Lactose intolerance Breastfeeding Bengali cuisine Protein-energy malnutrition Milk Theory of conduct Schistosomiasis Dietary fiber Escherichia coli Organic food Survival skills Soy milk Bread Agriculture Randomness Vampire Food preservation First aid Kodocha Dysentery Cuisine of the Southern United States Clostridium difficile Botulism Pitaten Kashrut Soup Factory farming German cuisine Urinary incontinence Cantonese cuisine Folic acid Soybean Tomato Antibiotic Tea Rice pudding Hiking Kosher foods Tooth Potato Trichinosis Chocolate Flatulence Breakfast McDonald's Vermicompost Tlingit Social rule Organic farming Cuisine of Malaysia Cat food Lactobacillus acidophilus Human feces The Star Wars Holiday Special Atkins Nutritional Approach

cat pregnancy my cat is pregant we dont know how far along can anybody give me some tips on whatt to look for and i need tips for during the birthing of the kittens what to do supplys this was a stray we picked up about months ago we didnt want to spay neuter whatever you do to a female cat because we didnt know wether or not she was going to stick around so do make a big deal hey there you may notice her nipples are pink and large when she is close she will start to lactate and you can find that out by squeezing a little on her nipple to see if any milk comes out keep checking her private area for mucus or blood or a bubble this will indicate that she is in labour i hope you have made her a nesting bed for when she gives birth you need to have it in a quiet room away from noise and any other cats because when she is in labour and there are loud noises or people or other cats she will delay the birth and it isn't good for mother or babies another way to tell when she is labour she will become very restless getting up and sitting down alot and cleaning her private area when she is labour just pat her and keep her calm if this is her first litter she will be nervous and not really know what is going on and she could bite or hiss at you so be careful and just reassure her now after you have been a bubble coming and it has popped that was the water breaking there will be a baby coming any moment you will be her face all pushed up like she is pushing you know it is coming and you will see waves in her tummy when you see a bubble it will be a baby now the first could take a little while to come out but don't stress but when it is out and its still in the sac and she doesn't seem to be doing anything you need to intervene and rip the bag open you will need to be wearing gloves and you will need scissors to cut the cord once it is out and the placenta is out you can let her eat it but never to many as she will vomit and have the runs now dont panic if it takes half an hour to an hour in between babies my cat held her last one for up to hours  Cat Breastfeeding Childbirth Guinea pig Obstetrics Kitten Pet skunk EastEnders Urinary incontinence Domestic rabbit Feral cat The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Nipple Shaggy dog story Dog Elephant Infant RuneScape quests Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dairy Pregnancy Bong Toilet humour Hamster Social rule Professional wrestling holds Escape from New York Platypus Atomic Kitten Mammary gland The Amber Spyglass Kodocha Tasmanian Devil Happy Tree Friends Coeliac disease Blood Simple Menstrual cup Breech birth Fecal incontinence Characters in Bleach series Manx (cat) Ferret Fertility awareness Premature birth Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Insomnia Ron and Fez Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Drawn Together Sleep Placenta Blood (computer game) Humphrey Bogart Cephalic disorder Doug Characters in the Smurfs Trailer Park Boys Giant Panda Blue Whale Jackass: The Movie Baldrick Minor Harry Potter Beasts Poker jargon Fire fighting Fetus Characters of Lost Comanche The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Vomiting Surveillance Condom Aerial (dance move) Toxoplasmosis Kakapo First aid Nile crocodile Spina bifida Tenshinhan Menstrual cycle The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Violin The Legend of Zelda series enemies House Mouse Gramophone record Textile manufacturing Domestic goat Internal ballistics Sharon Tate The Caves of Androzani Socialization Dialysis Umbilical cord

my bff lost her two kittens and has no idea where they are they are both girls and only one fixed the fixed one is a cream color on it's body and has blue eyes and black ears nose paws and tail that one has been missing for weeks the un fixed one is a tortie color which is like brown orange and black she has only a little bit of white mixed in here is a picture of one that looks like her http www norwegianforestcatbreeders co uk tortie tiganlea jpg this one has no white but her kitten does they both do not have collars and were lost weeks ago in o'fallon if you see one please call me or her or email me or her oh here is a picture that looks like a twin of the other kitten they are each kittens but the tortie one is younger please let me know if you see one if you see one please take it in your home and don't let it run out again http t images live com images thumbnail aspx q id d b c c ed e b b a email ijese hotmail com for the th answer they are not little bitty the cream one is months and the tortie is her baby she always is with her and acts like she is her mom so i really don't think they are dead it's possible that someone in your area found one or both of the kittens and have been taking care of them however this forum is international and since most people here probably don't know where o'fallon is you're likely wasting your time asking people here to look for the kittens your best bet is to search locally take those pictures and print them on flyers that you can attach to phone poles in the area they were lost call the local shelter and humane society if you have a local paper that allows such notices you could try that too and never let small helpless pets outside without supervision and collars with identification tags  Cat Dog Puma Siamese (cat) Ferret Color Cheetah Meriones unguiculatus Kitten Pet skunk Tortoiseshell cat Internet phenomenon House Mouse Cross site scripting Fancy rat Angora (cat) Dobermann Tabby cat Turkish Van James McNeill Whistler Vehicle registration plate Photography Guinea pig Garfield Gmail Goatse.cx Labrador Retriever Domestic rabbit Computer virus Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Tag Detroit Tigers Socialization Minor Harry Potter Beasts Bob and George Google The Standard The Island (2005 film) Dog agility Cat coat genetics Ron and Fez E-mail spam Every time you masturbate___ God kills a kitten Feral cat Breastfeeding CPU cache Digital photography Tattoo What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

help cat waking us up early in the morning our cat faith is years old she's always been a bit high maintenance and somewhat difficult to deal with but she's a good cat overall every once in a while she will wake my husband and i up early in the morning between am and am which is annoying but it usually only happens about once or twice a month the cats do not sleep in our room so our door is closed but for the last week she has been waking us up every morning am this morning she woke us up at am it is getting hard to deal with because we aren't getting all of our sleep we have tried squirting her w a water bottle but she runs away and comes back scratches the door and cries again and we've locked her in the bathroom but she still wails and i feel bad and she does it again the next night not sure what to do any suggestions remember cats are originally nocturnal animals meaning they can become more active during the night rather than during the day play with her before bedtime at least a good minutes if not more this way she will tire out and hopefully not want to come and wake you is there a specific reason she is waking you is her food bowl filled water bowl as well if there's no apparent reason then there are ways to deter this behavior try plugging in the vacuum cleaner and placing it near the door when she comes to wake you turn it on when she comes back turn it on again do this each time she comes to wake you up eventually she will understand that if she wakes you at that time that loud awful noise will start up never confine a cat because it is waking you up it is looking for attention and confining it is making it confused and possibly even depressed you will not teach it anything by confining it nor by hitting it if boredom is an issue playtime before bed and getting her an interactive toy to play with while you are asleep might help you also  Sleep Cat Housebreaking Dream The Shining (film) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sin City Shaggy dog story Mattress Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Avenue Q Social rule Toilet humour Friends Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Hikikomori Knots Landing Garfield Lucid dreaming Narcolepsy Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Ron and Fez Ferret Columbine High School massacre Oh My Goddess!

relocating the litter box and she wants to keep going in the old area we have recently moved the litter box from the basement bathroom to under the stairs she does use the litter box but sometimes she decides to poop on the bathroom floor she only poops there help me make it stop cats are creatures of habit and become upset when their routines are changed your cat may be having trouble adjusting to the new location of her litter box and may occasionally feel that she needs to use the familiar old location because of her confusion she may also detect residual odors from the previous box which might also prompt these accidents did you get a new litter box at the time of the move to the new location are you using a different type of litter these may also affect how the cat is reacting to the situation if you have changed the type of litter you use go back to the old type and gradually mix in the new litter until the cat becomes accustomed to it also be sure to clean the litter frequently daily is ideal so she has a clean area to use be sure to clean the old area in the bathroom thoroughly with an enzymatic cleaner such as equalizer or another product these would be available at pet stores or on line eliminating the odor will keep your kitty from returning to the scene of the crime and repeating the offense avoid using litter box liners as most cats don't like them and don't punish the cat if she should have another accident punishment is not a deterrent and only confuses the cat i hope this information is helpful  Hamster Domestic rabbit Fecal incontinence Cat Cat litter Blink-182 Fancy rat Pet skunk Guinea pig Gray Wolf Friends Housebreaking Pitaten Enzyme Basement Whose Line Is It Anyway?

how do cat's purr just wondering my cat also talks to his little lobster toy mostly in the middle of the night he grabs it in his mouth walks around the house and then sets it down in front of him and starts making these noises it's kind of like yodelling because the pitch goes up anyone else's cat do something like that lol to be honest even the scientists don't really know how a cat purrs there has been a lot of discussion about purring some vets or scientists don't think purring means anything others think that it does mean the cat is happy it also comes out in cats when they are totally freaked out and dying it seems that purring seems to calm down the cat it seems to be something that vibrates but nobody is really sure where it comes from we jokingly call it the purr box but it does seem to come from somewhere in the throat area but not really sure as far as the cat talking well that's really common more common if you have a siamese cat i have himalayan cats and the persian comes out in their lovely knotted fur but the siamese is their in their voices boy do they talk they talk to us they talk to each other they talk to them selves and they talk to their toys it's a strange sort of speach as you say i'm not sure if i would call it yodelling but the pitch does go up one of my cats is a runt and is totally built wrong and she is the funniest little thing but makes the weirdest sounds she snores at night while she talks she didn't start purring until we had her shaved about weeks ago she loves her new do and loves that we can get to her skin better and just purrs and purrs now but the noises at night can keep us up all night i think all cats make strange sounds i've had loads of cats and they always made weird noises some worse then others but the ones that play with toys do tend to talk to them i think only cats do it more than cats who have other cats to play with somewhere along the line i decided to get to cats and most of the time it has worked out quite well  Shaggy dog story Cat Purr Garfield The Inside "Weird Al" Yankovic Guinea pig Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Cheetah Late Night with Conan O'Brien Time Out of Mind Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.

other alternative to revolution for cats i've always used revolution for cats because it not only takes care of fleas but most other parasites i didnt realize that it required a rx from a vet and the vet im now going too doesnt write prescriptions for that stuff because he doesnt like it is there another alternative to revolution that will help with fleas ticks ringworm ear mites etc advantage and a twice yearly worming is all you need if the cat does not have mites why keep treating for it it really is overkill and that is why many vets do not like it  Heartworm Guinea pig Parasite Fancy rat Pet skunk Rocky Mountain spotted fever Dog Diseases of the honeybee Tick Veterinarian Flea Bat Mange Medical prescription Medicine Biological pest control -cide Canary Allergy Cat Arachnid Hematophagy Chicken Dr. Seuss Lyme disease Parasitology Ferret Feral cat Beekeeping Microchip implant (animal) RFID Arthropod Dracunculiasis Ringworm Linked list Garfield Final Fantasy X Tiny Toon Adventures House dust mite Tampa, Florida Shampoo -ology Michael Balzary Care Bears Varroa destructor Synergy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sin City Pneumonia Chocolate Asthma Education in Australia Comb Coercion Antidepressant Randomness Rocko's Modern Life Typhus Neoptera Publicly funded medicine Beagle Animal Socialization Ozzie, Slash, and Flea Docking Pesticide Chronic fatigue syndrome Psoriasis Pollinator decline Homeopathy Gothic metal Pharmaceutical company Girly Emergency contraception Robert A.

when to get a kitten spade we have a kitten who we think is around months old and she has just recently started calling or so we think she is a lot less agressive than normal and is rubbing around everything and meowing a lot while laying on the floor would you say that this is typical behaviour of a kitten who is calling and when is the best time to get her spade if she is we have been advised by a relative to wait until she is not calling to get her done because if you get them done when they are calling they tend to stay in this behaviour pattern but given the fact that she is a lot calmer and generally a nicer cat when she is calling should we get her spade now or wait until she is no longer calling as advised so confused help in the uk cats are neutered from months old the second answer is likely to come from the us should the cat be in season it is advisable to wait a couple of months a pre operative visit to the vet is necessary prior to the operation this is usually provided free of charge therefore i recommend you take advantage of it and ask a vet to check out your kitten and advise accordingly good luck  Cat Kitten Ferret Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Housebreaking Feral cat Guinea pig Manx (cat) Poker jargon Socialization Drill bit Garfield RuneScape quests Dog Randomness CPU cache Siamese (cat) Social rule The Amazing Race Finesse Computer virus Redundant array of independent disks GSM services Prostate cancer Hearts (game) Fancy rat RuneScape Random Events President (game) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Phoebe Buffay's songs Atomic Kitten Microeconomics Stud poker Kakapo Sleeping Murder Maine Coon Jury trial Education in Australia Lie C plus plus Draw poker Bulgarian language Tai shogi Sheepshead Asiatic Golden Cat Acne Skat Sudoku Divorce 2000 Australian Grand Prix Bulk vending Contract bridge Grammatical gender Purr Semiconductor device Speed of light Evil reptilian kitten-eater from another planet Ethology Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 American and British English differences Equine conformation Human sexual behavior Autism Chocolate Goatse.cx Betting (poker) Spanish pronouns Squirrel Tick Badly Drawn Kitties Polish language Paragliding Cats (musical) Economics Strap-on dildo Pretty Good Privacy Theory of conduct Feral Azumanga Daioh Basic English StarCraft: Hybrid Bamboo Surreal number Shogi Bank Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 6 Bast (goddess) Big Brother UK series 5 Publicly funded medicine Monarchy in Canada Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Sarah Kerrigan Airport Lithium ion battery Monty Hall problem Puma

any tips on taking care of newborn kittens if the mother is not available to care for them for whatever reason then here is what you will need to do go to your local pet store or wal mart even and buy kitten milk replacement and a tiny bottle in the pet isle mix and feed according to the directions at first you will have to force small amounts of formula into them this is not natural but has to be done do it slowly so that they don't get the fluid in thier lungs by aspirating it which can cause pnemonia and possibly kill them be sure to rub their backs gently after they eat to help them burp and help start the digestion process rub them gently but firmly with a towel to stimulate thier circulation and get them more active several times a day you will need to also stimulate their genitals and anus with a paper towel or old rag after they eat kittens are not able to go to the bathroom on their own and the momma normally takes care of this they will start going on their own around weeks or so keep them clean and dry don't let them get overheated though a small laundry basket or cardboard box lined with an old towel or baby blanket works great just be sure that they are protected from any other animals male cats will usually kill the kittens and on occasion a female will as well dogs also pose a threat around and a half to weeks start to introduce them to some kitten food that is moistened with a bit of warm water or some of their formula and a small amount of wet cat food give them a shallow bowl of fresh water too you will need to wipe them off with a warm damp cloth after they eat since they get kinda messy this is also a good age to start to introduce them to the litter box take a little of the dirty paper that you stimulate them with and place it in the box so that they get the scent of it make sure it is no more than an inch and a half to two inches high or they will have problems getting into it if they mess outside the box simply place the feces in it it is usually fairly easy to train them as it is instinctual for them to use it you will need to get them in to see a vet around weeks so they can be wormed and then around weeks they can start getting their shots and finding new homes good luck  Hamster Cat Breastfeeding Pet skunk Kitten Fancy rat Menstrual cup Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Ferret Fecal incontinence Japanese toilet Milk Dog Strap-on dildo Elephant Upholstery Diseases of the honeybee Socialization Toilet humour Spider Mattress House Mouse Japanese tea ceremony Chocolate Hedgehog Sauna Dairy Feral cat Thermal power station Textile manufacturing Hazing Oral sex First aid Bong Carnivorous plant Fire fighting Garfield Animal communication Dialysis Towel Coprophagia Urinary incontinence Minor Harry Potter Beasts Sento Social rule Insulin Kitchen Hyperthermia Chinchilla Compost Tick Tattoo Menstrual cycle Vermicompost Plastic Domestic goat Bird Jackass: The Movie Care Bears Violin Anal sex Chicken American lobster Comanche Characters in the Smurfs Paper Drill bit Idli Manicure Kakapo Puma Tarantula Androgen insensitivity syndrome Procter & Gamble Shit Snake Phoebe Buffay's songs Dry cleaning Tea Aerial (dance move) Manx (cat) Climate of the United Kingdom Cheese Euphemism Anus American Alligator Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma

cat anxiety i will be going away a couple of weekends over the next few months and i just went away overnight and notice my cat was anxious when i returned home i think i'm now getting anxiety thinking about the upcoming weekends i will be away they are no more than nights but i feel badly about leaving her i've actually thought about getting another cat but i have a small place and she's yrs old and gets all my attention so i don't know if another cat would actually make it worse my hubby thinks i have more separation anxiety than my pet i just worry any advice most cats will appear anxious pouting or angry when you leave them overnight or for a few days don't get too anxious another cat might deflect some of that anxiety and keep them more occupied when you are gone but having another pet in the household after being an only child for a long time could also stress them out don't get too anxious ultimately they will still be mad at you when you return it's just part of a cat's normal personality  Anxiety Stuttering General anxiety disorder Shaggy dog story Narcissism Urinary incontinence Attachment theory Dog Obsessive-compulsive disorder Pet EastEnders Doug Pet Sematary Panic attack Knots Landing WFAN (AM) Agoraphobia Fruits Basket The Cat in the Hat Infertility Procrastination Clinical depression Venom (comics) Humphrey Bogart Pet Sounds Red Dwarf characters Oh My Goddess!

advice on a mixed breed cat my first cats were stray cats which i picked up from the streets they both ran away because i let them out every night and one day they just didn't show up anyway i adopted a week old kitten from a friend of mine it is a mixed breed betwen an angora and a persian it is grey and it looks like the persian except the face which isn't as flat as a persian's it's very playful and very spoiled and by spoiled i mean he loves being pet and purrs every time i touch him his name is toulouse after the painter and the kitten in the aristocats my question is do you have any advice on how to raise it the websites won't help because it inherited both his parents and both breeds are extremely different and i won't be letting him out as i let my other cats out i am from romania and i don't know if de clawing is illegal but i am convinced not to do it even if it is legal i consider it a form of mutilation and i am the one to decide anything regarding toulouse not my parents even if i am only years old first of all i am happy to hear of your stance on declawing he is a cat cats are unique and mysterious magical and special think of using words like angora persian in the same way we use words like mexican and negro we recognize that we are all humans and have the same needs think the same way in cats obviously your new baby responds to love and cuddles and thats a great start cats love consistency and freedom in the amounts that they choose cats are independant and like to feel that they are doing what they are doing because its their idea you almost have to use psycology to get them to do something but they are very bright and intelligent although not on a human kind of intelligence this kitten will know his home is with you because he hasnt been a stray and i am not sure about your first strays but if you picked them up from the streets they may have felt that you took them from their home and just went home when the opportunity presented itself if you do intend for this cat to be an indoor only cat you will have the responsibility and the concern for his entire life that he not get out under any circumstance even accidentally because if he is not allowed to learn of the outside dangers and how to avoid them he will be at a distinct disdvantage if this should ever happen  Cat Pet skunk Turkish Van Team Rocket Domestic rabbit Friends Dog Ferret Treecat Turkish Angora The Fairly OddParents Pitaten Cats (musical) Monster Rancher monsters Abortion debate Baseball Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Garfield Avenue Q Minor Harry Potter Beasts Phoebe Buffay's songs B3ta Franz Boas Adoption Polyamory God Emperor of Dune The Aristocats Milton H.

my cat doesn't like my husband any suggestions i adopted a kitten a year ago from the humane society to keep my other cat company when i adopted her my husband was deployed to iraq he came home about seven months later and ever since the cat has hated him she doesn't hiss or anything but if he comes into the room she hides or runs away i've tried the technique of him feeding her so that she associates him in a positive manner but that doesn't really help he pets her when she lets him and is gentle but she refuses to bond with him any suggestions serious answers only please thank you there can be many reasons why your cat is afraid of your husband he shouldn't reach for her or try to grab her because that is too scary just think about how much bigger he is please be patient and let her come to you some cats are just more timid than others and some cats pick a human to be theirs and no other human will do he can try tempting her with treats it might be the fact that he smells different than you do maybe he should give you a big hug before he tries to pet the cat if that doesn't work you could try rubbing the cat's blanket on his hands first cats are very sensitive about smells in time the cat may warm up to him and then it may not  Cat Pet skunk Dog Shaggy dog story Dog training Sin City Feral cat Ferret Episodes of Lost (Season 2) RuneScape quests Ranma __ characters Domestic rabbit Socialization Care Bears Kitten Skunk Hamster Guinea pig Social rule One Piece minor characters Garfield Characters in the Smurfs Fancy rat Friends Characters of Naruto Animal communication EastEnders Azumanga Daioh Piccolo Junior Saga Theory of conduct Hellsing Jam (TV series) Phoebe Buffay's songs The Smoking Room Ron Weasley Spanking Lie Minor Harry Potter Beasts Teacher's Pet (Disney) Code: Lyoko Ultimate Spider-Man Tobacco smoking Albatross Breastfeeding Zoophilia Episodes of Lost (Season 1) InuYasha (character) Rabbit Cro Kim Possible Xiaolin Showdown Surveillance Taboo food and drink The Subtle Knife Doomsday argument Baldrick The Amber Spyglass The Star Wars Holiday Special Plame affair Haven (TNG episode) Toilet humour Rei Ayanami Symbiosis (TNG episode) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Kakapo Manx (cat) Tyrannosaurus rex Lazarus Long Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Kasparov versus The World Abortion debate Massage D.N.

will a cat be put down if shes pregnant theres this stray pregnant cat that hangs around my house and my mom doesnt want her to be here especially with more kittens so she wants to take her to the pound will she be put down even though shes pregnant how about if she arrives with a litter of new born kittens you'll have to call your local shelter to find out for sure where i live pregnant animals are not euthenized and the mother and kittens are kept well fed and cared for until its same for them to be adopted out call the shelter to find out first if you are planning on taking her to the pound yourself be very careful while handling her she will probably try to protect herself and her babies and may inadvertantly harm you its best to have the animal control come and get her if she bites you that will condemn her for sure  Cat Kitten Feral cat Pet skunk Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Animal shelter Socialization Rabbit Atomic Kitten Hamster Breastfeeding Feral Serval Dog Abortion debate Lady and the Tramp Elephant Ferret Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Brown Bear Friends Animal euthanasia Pregnancy Tick Neighbours Puma Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Garfield Rescue group Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Car safety Kodocha Roe v.

need advice quickly on cat my cat has been very sick the past few months it started out with him just dropping a lot of weight we took him to the vet but being away from us made him sicker so they sent him home we pumped him full of fluids via an iv and he eventually got better never all the way better but better to the point where he was eating he's had little episodes of this off and on in the recent months but now is his worst spell he hasn't eaten for days he is thin as a rail and his ears and eyes are yellow his gums are very white should we take him back to the vet in risk of him getting worse without us should we just wait and see what happens i am getting so worried he is my baby and i love him he is so much like a dog no other cat is like him and i don't want to lose him he's only three years old could this be fatty liver syndrome or does it sound like something worse like cancer okay i'm definately enjoying the ridiculous answers whatever it is it sounds like he is becoming extremely malnourished as a result your only option at this point is to take him to the vet for a full diagnosis while animals can be extremely loyal it doesn't seem right that he would let himself get progressively worse it goes against an animals basic survival insticts simply because he is homesick you might want to see another vet its possible he was mistreated at the other if you are sure beyond all doubt that the problem did not lay in the vet's office but in your cat's undying dedication to you then talk to your vet about any more treatments you can do for him at home maybe a high fat diet could help but you'll need to talk to the vet to be sure if not arrange frequent visits to stop and say hello let him know you're thinking about him also you might let him take a dirty t shirt of yours with him so he can still smell you prepare yourself if the condition continues to worsen you may not be able to do anything but let him go  Prostate cancer Garfield Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ferret Fancy rat Social rule Obesity Cat Guinea pig Hypoglycemia Stomach cancer Coeliac disease Kodocha Colorectal cancer Pet skunk Multiple sclerosis Chronic fatigue syndrome Shaggy dog story Insulin Binge eating disorder Cancer Dog Traumatic brain injury Atkins Nutritional Approach Tobacco smoking Sin City Crohn's disease Trailer Park Boys Recurring South Park characters Diarrhea Gout Hedgehog Domestic rabbit Glycogen storage disease type I Nutrition Growth hormone treatment Theory of conduct Fecal incontinence Piccolo Junior Saga Anorexia nervosa Pitaten Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Childbirth Phoebe Buffay's songs Dieting Folic acid Bipolar disorder Urinary incontinence Homer Simpson Rabies Stuttering Hamster Diazepam Spidey Super Stories Autism Gastroesophageal reflux disease M__ni__re___s disease Pneumonia Hypertension Ovarian cancer Elephant Tasmanian Devil Hearing impairment Milk Baldrick Egg (food) Irritable bowel syndrome Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Parkinson's disease EastEnders Omega-3 fatty acid The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Friends Tocopherol AIDS reappraisal Stroke Androgen insensitivity syndrome Chlorpromazine RuneScape quests Cowboy Bebop Carburetor Little Britain Monster Rancher monsters Eating disorder Babe Ruth The Ashlee Simpson Show Liver Vitamin C

one more cat name question i swear this is the last one i took in a cat last week her former owners called her cleo but i don't like the name i want to change her name but she is already licensed and in the vet's records as cleo and her former owners will probably visit a lot because they live across the street from me to put my mind at ease should i give her a middle name and call her by that or should i just change her name altogether i doubt she knows her name she was an only cat and so she seems to respond to cat owner voice in general i think that if you don't like the name then you should just change it altogether i am sure the vet could change his records and the previous owners will eventually get over it if they don't like you doing so too i mean it is your cat now and certainly never belonged to the vet lol  Pet skunk Garfield Cyndi Lauper Ferret Philadelphia Eagles Billboard Hot 100 The Cure Metaphysics Sly & the Family Stone New York Giants Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Swift Vets and POWs for Truth Pretty Good Privacy Cleveland Browns Time Out of Mind B3ta Phoebe Buffay's songs Social rule Miss Cleo Randomness Mutts Animal euthanasia SCO v.

why is my cat trying to scratch inside his ears would someone please tell me why my two and a half year old nutered cat is trying to scratch inside his ears he has scratched so hard until he has scratched out all the hair near his ear and it turned red i put a lil antibiotic cream neosporin on the sore area and i orderd some anti itch hydrocotizone cream from drs foster smith for the itching but he still keeps trying to scratch in his ear could it be ear mites when i look in his ears they look clean i dont have money for a vet so is there something i can buy from petland discount in my neighborhood that would help with whatever is in his ears now hes started to scratch at both of them thank you so much for any answers in laymans terms please i can understand that you do not have funds for a vet when he scratches does his other back foot do a thumping action that is an indication of pain if there are ear mites which is what i would think then mineral oil as suggested will help kill them ear mites if left untreated can have long term problems your use of neosporin may have been extremely helpful as infections can be rather nasty try and find a way of saving up or borrowing some funds for a vet check up you may be able to reduce the problem assuming it is ear mites but the long term final solution is generally available only from a vet if it is ear mites then request the vet kill them not just give you ear drops to kill them the vet will use an insecticide that is suitable for cats  Guinea pig Fancy rat Psoriasis Diseases of the honeybee Otitis externa Scabies Eczema Allergy Cat Group A streptococcal infection Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Dog Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pollinator decline Prostate cancer Traumatic brain injury Dialysis Diving Equine conformation Diamond Chronic fatigue syndrome Stomach cancer Monetary policy Breastfeeding Electrophysiology House dust mite Itch Betting (poker) Earwax Paranoia Agent Common cold DVD Lyme disease Canary Mosquito Gramophone record Conjunctivitis Violin Winter Soldier Investigation Pharyngitis Pet skunk RuneScape quests Fecal incontinence Doom enemies First aid Social rule Kakapo Futurama (TV series - season 5) Sin City Piccolo Junior Saga Tattoo Balance disorder Marilyn Monroe Dandruff Pitaten Tick Computer virus Characters in the Smurfs Biological pest control Massage Keynesian economics Medical prescription Mutual fund Hearing impairment Boston Public Chlorpromazine Inflation Sickle-cell disease Carbon dioxide Mouth ulcer Milk Shaggy dog story Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome The Time Machine Ferret Malaria Honeybee Economy of Russia Rabies Bond Tooth enamel Asthma 2005 Iditarod Tuberculosis Rocky Mountain spotted fever Tobacco smoking Aerial (dance move) Codename: Kids Next Door Earring Zagreus (Doctor Who audio) Annuity Mattress Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Billiards Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005

how can you get your cat to quit pissing on your furniture he has been neutered and declawed any sugestions on how to ge the smell out of furniture and clothing neutering doesn't always prevent spraying and if you neuter the cat after he has already started spraying then the behavior will still continue two things need to happen for him to stop he needs to be trained not to spray this should be done without anger yelling or physical violence cats do not respond well to being spanked or yelled at and this will only make the behavior worsen i would try either giving him rewards for not spraying or squirting water at him and firmly saying no whenever he is about to also never rub his nose in it and never punish him for spraying unless you catch him in the act there are alot of great products out there to help remove the odor from your furniture it is a hard odor to remove and if he can still smell his urine on something then he will still think it's ok to spray i did a search on petsmart com for such products and this is what came up http www petsmart com global search search results jsp if you see something you might like then click on the product and read the product review written by other consumers who've bought and tried that product this will help you find a product that works instead of trying a bunch without knowing what others who used it had to say about it also petvideo com has two short informational videos on cat's spraying that you might find interesting here's the link for that http www petvideo com index cgi category good luck  Cat Pet skunk Skunk Dog training Spanking Fire fighting Housebreaking World Wide Web The Inside Ajax (programming) Uniform Resource Locator Domestic rabbit Cross site scripting Sin City Toilet humour Electronic commerce Human sexual behavior JavaServer Pages Slashdot trolling phenomena Dog HyperText Transfer Protocol Sulfur Urine Animal Crossing Prostate cancer Three Stooges RuneScape quests Advertising Piccolo Junior Saga Addiction Tobacco smoking Hazing Traumatic brain injury America Online Guinea pig Strap-on dildo Cyanide Grammatical gender Kazaa Copy protection Fight Club PHP HTTP cookie Jam (TV series) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Capitalism Emergency preparedness Russian joke Trademark Shaggy dog story Sonic the Hedgehog Shit Bart chalkboard gags Diseases of the honeybee Great Depression Phishing Polish language Urinary incontinence Teen Girl Squad Graffiti Upholstery The Price Is Right Japanese toilet Video game controversy Columbine High School massacre Illegal drug trade Windows XP Paintball CPAN Domain Name System Solar variation Noam Chomsky Everything2 Thermal power station Hyperthermia Search engine optimization Web traffic Tofu Corporal punishment Luck German grammar Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Pitaten Beavis and Butt-head Kitten Milton H.

how can i get my cat to improve his behaviour my cat was a three year old with serious behavior problems when i adopted him but he has improved a lot because i'm very consistent about my expectations my problem is it stresses me out when i have to give him a smack on the bottom and i wish i knew a better way it's not like i always have a bottle of water handy to spray him when he bites or scratches at totally random times so far he hasn't really hurt me but i would like to curb this behavior before it goes too far once when my friend was taking care of him he bit her hard enough to draw blood but then i found out that's because she practically stuck her toe in his jaws most of the time he's a good and affectionate kitty except he can also be really loud he was abused as a kitten and then raised in a home with a lot of instability i want to be able to keep him and take care of him but i need to know how to handle his problems better he is all ready set in his ways don't smack him on the bottom or any were if you just pick him up and look him in the eye and tell him no not loud but firm he will know what you are talking about it may take awhile but he will get it when you smack him on the bottom he thinks he is not loved and won't care what he dose he thinks he is in the same kind of home and a spray bottle just makes him mad just a firm no and let him know you still love him but he has to be good i hope it helps let me know  Theory of conduct Pitaten Happy Tree Friends Garfield Social rule Pet skunk Infantilism Equine conformation Poker jargon Guinea pig Piccolo Junior Saga Friends 2000 Australian Grand Prix Kodocha Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Randomness Extreme Programming Clinical depression Dog Efficiency wages Milton H.

how do i stop my cat from fighting my new kitten we foster rescue animals and have pets of our own so our house is a constant changing shuffle of cats and dogs one technique we have found that is handy and works is getting a squirtgun and watching the cat when it is about to pounce on the kitten or when it puffs up hisses etc spray it eventually the older cat will figure out that a face full of water is not worth tormenting the new kitten also make sure your kitten has plenty of toys that will help keep the kitten from trying to get the other cat to play the invitation to play might be the kitten jumping on stalking or batting at the older cat which will irritate the older cat causing it to strike and remember to make an effort to give the older cat extra attention so he she knows that the kittten does not affect the love or care the older cat receives if you see the older cat and the kitten near each other and the older cat is calm praise the older cat with pets and treats also a little time will prob be the best solution until they bond feed them seperately and supervise them good luck  Cat Pet Pet skunk Domestic rabbit Socialization Ferret RuneScape quests Kitten Garfield Housebreaking Cats (musical) Guinea pig Feral cat Dog Feral Hamster Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Azumanga Daioh Pitaten Big Brother UK series 5 Softball Pet store Puma Fancy rat Rabies Rabbit Ralston Purina Company Atomic Kitten Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Ron Weasley Treecat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers Care Bears Serval Tokyo Mew Mew Asiatic Golden Cat Marc Antony and Pussyfoot Sluggy Freelance Krypto the Superdog Teacher's Pet (Disney) Ranma __ characters Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Dog training Maneki Neko Manx (cat) Darkwing Duck Siamese (cat) Tooth enamel Kodocha Tai shogi Bengal cat Skunk Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Ren and Stimpy Canary DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Minor Harry Potter Beasts Tick Baseball Stars The Amber Spyglass Garfield and Friends OpenBSD Dean Koontz German Shepherd Dog Internet phenomenon Galaxy Angel Golden Retriever Toy Story 2 Urinary incontinence Taikyoku shogi The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Doug Silly Symphonies Maka dai dai shogi Bat Badly Drawn Kitties Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Our Gang Working dog Goatse.cx Rescue group Turkish Van Lady and the Tramp Spotted Skunk Animation in the United States in the television era Blackjack Samurai Pizza Cats Poker jargon Fire fighting Domestication My Parents are Aliens Shaggy dog story DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Animal shelter 2000 Australian Grand Prix Violin Griffon Bruxellois

my cat was neutered and later was diagnosed with a uti is neutering the cause of uti's no the two are not related neutering removes the testicles utis are caused by a bacterial overload or imbalance in the urinary tract not connected to the testicles in any way if your cat has recurring utis they keep coming back or never go away you should ask your vet about changes you can make in your cat's life to reduce the risk of further infections it may be something as simple as a change in his diet  Urinary tract infection Medical analysis of circumcision Castration Cat Ferret Urinary incontinence Prostate cancer Intravenous therapy Feral cat Domestic rabbit Ulcerative colitis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hip fracture Urinary system Epilepsy Guinea pig Crohn's disease Epididymitis Pet skunk Vulvovaginal health Testicular torsion Cirrhosis Replacement joint Nutrition Sterilization (surgical procedure) Vitamin C Benign prostatic hyperplasia Urine Endocarditis Cancer Obesity Chronic fatigue syndrome Diabetes mellitus Bacteria Kidney stone Gastroenteritis Terri Schiavo Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Diabetic neuropathy Intersex surgery Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Multiple sclerosis Acute renal failure Group A streptococcal infection Cystic fibrosis Colorectal cancer Co-trimoxazole Toxoplasmosis Kidney Stomach cancer Prostatitis Common cold Gallstone Coeliac disease Gonorrhoea AIDS Tobacco smoking Circumcision advocacy Lumbar puncture Muscle Endometriosis Medicine IgA nephropathy HIV test Fancy rat Residual-current device Cryptorchidism Brain Virus Conjunctivitis Aortic dissection Breastfeeding Parkinson's disease Trimethoprim Diarrhea Kitten Testicular cancer Acne Leukemia Erysipelas Pelvic inflammatory disease Garfield Tooth enamel Diabetic nephropathy Bulgarian language Foodborne illness Autoimmune diseases Oscilloscope Coma Bacteremia Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders Dog Cervical cancer Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Folic acid Cellulitis Escherichia coli Haemochromatosis Cephalic disorder

what is a good way to train a month old cat to go wee wee in the litter box she does her other business in there just fine but for some reason she doesn't go tinkle in the box she either goes right outside the box or on my living room carpet i've never had a cat before so this is all new to me help cats usually learn to use the litter box from their mother and should be completely housebroken by the time they're old enough to be adopted if you've had the cat for awhile and this is a new behavior it's likely due to a health problem like kidney failure uti etc or because the litter box is too smelly they dislike using dirty litterboxes i'm assuming since you call it a she that this is not a male cat but some males spray or mark their territory which is very hard to correct some cats pee on carpet when they're stressed you've introduced a new pet or family member taken a vacation etc if she does this every time and has always done it it is very unlikely that you can train this out of her take her to a vet for a medical evaluation medication or advice on training  Pet skunk Cat Domestic rabbit Fancy rat Guinea pig Toilet humour Urinary incontinence Manx (cat) Ferret Dog Hamster Housebreaking Toxoplasmosis Socialization Urine Animal communication Tobacco smoking Breastfeeding Black panther Rabies Friends Feral cat Dog training Cat litter Prolog Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Medicine Moe Szyslak Taboo food and drink Flea The Cat in the Hat Traumatic incident reduction Plastic Red Dwarf characters Education in Japan President of Singapore Folic acid Veterinarian Microchip implant (animal) Circumcision Phoebe Buffay Alternative medicine Big Day Out Kitten Hypertension Obedience training Phoebe Buffay's songs Albert Ellis Transsexuality Software testing Ernest Hemingway Liger Physician Raw food diet Tai Chi Chuan The Beach Boys House Mouse Unemployment Diatomaceous earth Camp Lazlo Ethics Diabetes mellitus Canary Education in Australia Condom Maine Coon The Marshall Mathers LP Penis Stuttering Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Randomness Sleep Childbirth Pee-wee's Playhouse Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cheetah Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Carpet Kim Possible Chinchilla Health insurance Pet Sounds Garfield The Sims Boxing training Dynamic Systems Development Method Extreme Programming C plus plus The Pet Sounds Sessions Psychiatry Psychotherapy Code: Lyoko Computed tomography Scientology beliefs and practices Felis sapiens Jackass: The Movie Good Times

whats the best way to tame a cat i've been looking after a cat that was feral at one stage her kitten the others were put down before i got them is a very friendly kitten that has no problem demanding being patted and stroked by anyone and everyone she's progressed too she spent a lot of time hiding under our bed apart from to come out to use the litter box and now she comes out and eats with our other cats and sleeps in the sun around our home i have picked her up before but only when she's rubbing up against other cats and feels secure i can approach her when she is sleeping on the bed if i go very slow and maybe one out of ten tries i can stroke her but progress has slowed down i'd love to tame her down more she's very soft and silky she hasn't scratched once she's a real gem does anyone have any tips first of all thanks for being patient i am currently working on a feral mommy one thing i found very useful was petting the kitty with a back scratcher it got her use to being touched but she didn't feel like i was invading her space someone else suggested tuna great idea any type of strong smelling moist food is great the kitty will smell it and come out to get some when she does talk very softly to her and try to rub her she will eventually associate petting with good feelings mostly just be patient she may or may not come around the important thing is that she doesn't sound aggressive  Cat Guinea pig Garfield Feral cat Dog Domestic rabbit Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Pet skunk Ferret Hamster Shaggy dog story Kitten Stomach cancer Traumatic brain injury Little Britain Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Consciousness Salad Fingers Atomic Kitten Avenue Q Phoebe Buffay's songs King Crimson Fancy rat Animal communication Catscratch Social rule Sluggy Freelance Friends RuneScape quests Pitaten The Smoking Room Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Blood on the Tracks Characters in the Smurfs Domestication Milton H.

all animals and your vet should be telling you what to do since you do have a ''tiger'' an endangered species in your collection of pets i am sure he has his own private vet who should be telling you what to do and what not to are u sure u just want to ''clip'' his nails than actually dig out his claws for its well known purposes anywayz none of my business i do not know much of ''private ownership of tigers'' but have a look at this article and visit this web site if you feel like tigers can grow to weigh between and pounds and can live to be over years of age the cub stage doesn't last long since they grow at a rate of about pounds a month as young adults they begin to urinate to mark territory including their bedding in fact they love to mark fresh clean bedding their urine is tacky and very pungent and often times pointed at people too tigers eat meat period they don't eat hot dogs and can't live on chicken alone tigers need red meat such as beef bison or venison in a year an adult tiger can eat to tons of meat vitamin supplements may also be required depending on the quality of meat you can provide and how well the cat was nourished as a cub tigers can kill these natural predators are one of nature's best designed killers and humans are attacked every year both in captivity and in the wild roy horn need we say more in order to truly bond with a tiger you have to live eat and breath it every day every day no vacations no separation of tiger home and your home no time to work a job elsewhere no family and friends allowed people who have shown off their ability to truly bond with tigers roy horn et al have dedicated their entire lives to those animals living with them literally for every one of those unique situations there are thousands of others that fall far short of that dream causing officials to confiscate and sanctuaries to rescue tigers from back yards every day in the united states federal government signed a new bill into law that makes it illegal to sell big cats to be kept as pets and makes it illegal to own them as pets if an owner does not hold proper usda licensing and local required permits the fines are substantial and the cat will be confiscated this is the first federal law ever to address the exotic pet trade in our country additional laws vary by state county and city some states and local governments ban exotics entirely so is owning a tiger fun if you think fun is never again taking a vacation perhaps over the next years if you're properly caring for your tiger it will bond with you as it's keeper no one else will be able to safely feed it give it medical attention or clean up after it when it does need medical attention good luck finding a 'local' veterinarian willing to help most are not trained or equipped to handle treating a tiger when you're lucky enough to find one it may be quite expensive the outcome of keeping big cats as pets is often isolation isolation from loved ones neighbors friends and others who lack your extreme passion for animals if you are alone in your desire to own a tiger understand you may be even more alone once you have one an ideal tiger habitat will be include lots of greenery and a water feature tigers will defecate and urinate in their water feature so be ready to clean it frequently real grass and dirt not concrete and plenty of room to stalk and jump and hide are essential boomer balls and shelter are important features too depending on where you live winter quarters may be needed and in the event of needing medical treatment a means of locking down the cat and transporting it safely are a must just to clarify people's homes garages apartments and caravans do not a good tiger home make if you do genuinely own a tiger hey thats cool owning and lettiing him live would be great and blend in with your own environment huh good luck but take care do things with someone to assist u  Fancy rat Garfield Ferret Brown Bear Dog Kangaroo

is there something seriously wrong with my cat i have cats that are sisters we have had them since hours old which has been for yrs now one of the cats piglet will lay under our computer desk and she is breathing rather hard and her sister wiggles will not leave her side and everytime wiggles sees someone she runs up to them and starts meowing and runs back to her sister piglet gets up and eats but then goes back to that same exact spot if you have any answers please tll me now she has been up and moving around and she seems bloated she will only eat soft cat food but she is moving around like normal there are two reasons to seek a vet help one is a change in litter box habits or output for instance a runny stool is often a sign of an illness or it could be a result of a change in food without a vet opinion you will not know the second reason is if there is a dramatic change in their habits for what you have described with piglet i think that qualifies and the behavior of wiggles would tell me that she senses something is not right with piglet when i got my two kittens spayed things seemed normal but my one kitten stayed very close to the other and acted almost like a nurse sure enough my one kitten had a cold and probably was coming down with it when she was spayed a trip to the vet and it was quickly solved and she got better and lived a very long life  Cat Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Ferret Stereoscopy Manx (cat) Pet skunk Pig Dog Garfield Fecal incontinence Philosophy of language Socialization Ron and Fez Housebreaking Feral cat Hamster Fancy rat Breastfeeding Azumanga Daioh Randomness Stomach cancer Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Asiatic Golden Cat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Alexander Technique Treecat Girly Tag Complexity classes P and NP 2000 Australian Grand Prix Lie Weather lore Silent Night, Deadly Night Urinary incontinence The Pack (Buffy episode) Tooth enamel Abstraction (computer science) Terri Schiavo Chlorpromazine Kodocha Badly Drawn Kitties Phoebe Halliwell Ranma __ characters Poker jargon Theory of conduct Food Gray Wolf Razorback Collision detection The Amber Spyglass Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Abortion debate FoxTrot House Mouse Expert system RuneScape quests Extraterrestrial skies Tick Puma Charles Darwin's illness Botulism Cockroach Anorexia nervosa European Rabbit Purr Leopard The Cat in the Hat Chess (musical) Nicomachean Ethics Victor Cousin Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Glossary of partner dance terms Shen Gong Wu Tlingit High-heeled shoe Phoebe Buffay's songs Chocolate Semiconductor device Kakapo Another Side of Bob Dylan Jumpstart 3rd Grade Clouded Leopard Spot (Star Trek) Epistemology Sant Thakar Singh Siamese (cat) Decompression sickness Dilbert Cheetah Halting problem Coprophagia Liquid breathing Science Autism El Goonish Shive

is it really a popular danish custom to put a black cat in a barrel to hang from a tree and hit with a bat a danish couple told me that it is a happy age old custom across denmark to put a living black cat in a sealed barrel suspend it from a tree at a party and then pound it with a baseball bat they said little danish children love this tradition and everyone cheers when the cat screams inside the barrel when it is hit it's like a gory pinata the first person to knock the bloody cat out of the barrel would be the queen for the day and the person who knocked the last board would be king for the day these looked like regular people and they are educated but were they telling the truth i was horrified i told them it would be a crime in the usa but they didn't understand why they couldn't understand why i was horrified either it may or may not be a traditoin but it is in my opinion the stupidist i have a black cat and just hearing that makes me glad i am not danish that is horrible the person who beats the poor cat out should be in jail for a day plus the other people so the tradition would be better if they put a person in a barrel then they would know how it feels to get the crap beat out of you in a barrel just to make someone have fun just because of an old stupid tradition  Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Babe Ruth's Called Shot 2005 ICC Trophy Birthday Futurama (TV series - season 5) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fancy Crane EastEnders Ty Cobb Shaggy dog story The Catcher in the Rye The Shining (film) Sin City Ren and Stimpy Joe DiMaggio Invader Zim Flag of Denmark Garfield W.I.T.C.H.

will i ever be able to tell the kittens apart two of our cats mated a black cat and a tiger striped cat all four of the kittens came out black all look exactly the same and now over a month and a half later the only differences we can tell are the two boys and two girls and one is really fat and one is really skinny we can't look and say who is who will it eventually get better or will the rest of their lives need to be spent with collars so they can have names and be individuals when they get older their face shape may change and you can tell the difference between all of them if not as they grow up with you you should thell the difference between them in their personalities but i would definitely keep different colored collars on them  Cat Kitten Ferret Tai shogi Puberty Garfield Puma Lion Maka dai dai shogi Feral cat Phoebe Buffay's songs Tigon Cats (musical) Dai dai shogi Liger Taikyoku shogi Socialization Dog Bengal cat Doug Guinea pig Dai shogi Maltese tiger White tiger Monster Rancher monsters Black panther Treecat Species Sexual attraction Panthera hybrid Sexual differentiation Animal Comanche Vegeta Manx (cat) Bast (goddess) Detroit Tigers Wolfrider Camouflage Tokyo Mew Mew The Aristocats Xiaolin Showdown Tenchi Muyo!

any ideas on possible kinds of worms on a stray kitten hi my wife and i found abandoned kittens near our house after church today one seems alright but the other has some form of worm around its' butt i don't know if they are tape worms or maybe maggots but there are a lot of them they are tiny about the size of an eyelash i have given the kitten a bath and my wife has been trying to remove the worms the kitten's butt appears to be swollen as it is protruding kind of like a hemroid as near as we can tell the worms have made a hole in the protrusion we have tried some peroxide to get them out but i'm curious to know if anyone might have a better idea of exactly what these worms are and how if we can do something we haven't thought of yet i will be taking the cat to the vet first thing monday but until then we want to do what we can to help thanks for right now just wait until the vet appointment tomorrow be sure to bring a small fresh stool sample with you this way they can check to see what parasites your kittens have it sounds like tapeworms but they can have other things too like roundworms or coccidia nothing else is going to work on them so you might as well stop using the peroxide be sure to wash your hands immediately after handling the kittens as some parasites like rounds can be transmitted to people  Pet skunk Garfield Animal Conspiracy (TNG episode) Phoebe Buffay's songs Kitten Computer virus Ferret Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Intestinal parasite Heartworm Fecal incontinence Sampling (music) Roundworm Dracunculiasis Violin Floppy disk Foodborne illness Cestoda The Amber Spyglass Toilet humour Trichinosis Body piercing Shaggy dog story Schistosomiasis Diarrhea Baylisascaris Cysticercosis Drill bit Sento Socialization Fancy rat Hydrogen peroxide M16 (rifle) Enterprise content management Dairy Stopping e-mail abuse Tick The Inside Toxoplasmosis Goatse.cx Randomness Organic peroxide Philip J.

help cat urinating again in house after urinary problem my year old cat neutered had bouts of urinary infections at the beginning of summer about weeks apart during that time he would pee just a little in about different places in the house and also used the litter box he never went anywhere besides the litter box until the infections i changed his food to a special formula which seemed to do the trick he didn't get another infection or pee in the house but he is starting to do it again and is not exhibiting any of the symptoms of an infection or problem i did clean the areas as much as i could with vinegar enzyme cleaners etc any ideas would be greatly appreciated thank you for all your great answers i brought him to the vet the first time and he did have any infections and only a few crystals when they tested it the second time i called the vet and he told me to try a urinary formula diet which i did the one i use is nature's recipe urinary health the vet gave him a diuretic shot and antibiotics to promote him to pee more and wipe out the infection he is not crying the way he did the first times and the urine is clear to yellow which when he had the infections it was very concentrated brown almost or tinged with blood so i don't know if i am dealing with a health or behavioural question i am calling the vet tomorrow it is important to note whether he had sand stones or mucous in his urine when he was ill for bladder stones there is a hill's diet s r that is good to feed them out of every weeks to dissolve stones forming in the bladder the rest of the time he should be on a urinary health diet purina u r is what i prefer it is great to promote urinary health and prevent mucous but is less fattening than hill's c d diet which is the hill's equivalent my mother's cat a neutered male as well had terrible trouble with bladder infection and blockages as well and his problem was sand in the urine and so forth we fed him u r for weeks then s r for a week and kept rotating as such and he did great until the day he died at the ripe old age of oh and don't forget regular exams at least yearly with urinalyses to keep tabs on his urinary health should he ever become blocked you're looking at big hospitalization bills or a dead cat so prevention is much better for both of you  Urinary incontinence Urinary system Prostate cancer Urine Kidney stone Urinary tract infection Guinea pig Breastfeeding Vitamin C Hamster Ferret Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Fancy rat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Schistosomiasis Pneumonia Kidney Medical analysis of circumcision Rocky Mountain spotted fever Cancer Urination Penis Medicine Tobacco smoking Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Kitten Cirrhosis Autoimmune diseases Traumatic brain injury Nephrology Multiple sclerosis Protein-energy malnutrition Acne Cytomegalovirus Bearberry Gonorrhoea Nutrition Common cold Drug test Diseases of the honeybee Dialysis Raw food diet Folic acid Dog Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Group A streptococcal infection Certified Nursing Assistant Babe Ruth Coeliac disease Allergy Livestock Gastroenteritis Stroke Escherichia coli O157:H7 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Tick Al-Razi Medical prescription Vulvovaginal health Hypoglycemia Heartworm Interstitial cystitis Diabetic nephropathy Acute renal failure Little Britain Tuberculosis Housebreaking Zagreus (Doctor Who audio) Diabetes mellitus Tooth enamel Gallstone Hydronephrosis Garfield Hepatitis American lobster Vegetarianism Hyperglycemia Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency Benign prostatic hyperplasia Legionellosis Chocolate Menstrual cup Lassa fever Shaggy dog story

cat scratching herself raw help we have a year old female cat that scratches and cleans herself until she has huge raw spots on her back she doesnt have fleas the vet actually told us she has in human terms obsessive compulsive disorder we have to keep a cloth coat on her to try to heal some of the sores she has been like this over years does anyone know what we could do for her if you haven't already done so it's a good idea to get the vet to test for things such as diet sensitivity and allergies psychogenic or nervous dermatitis is often a reaction to severe stress or recent illness the normal adult cat spends over a third of it's waking day grooming aside from the obvious benefits like ridding themselves of parasites and keeping the coat clean cats also find grooming therapeutic in helping to relieve tension some sensitive cats use grooming as a comforting diversionary activity when faced with some kind of challenge or perceived threat is she a fairly timid cat try to think back to when this behaviour began and see if you can remember anything that might have been a trigger some less confident cats will become stressed by changes of any kind even something like new furniture or decorating is she allowed outside at all cats also require a lot of mental stimulation to stop them from becoming bored if she is an indoor only pet then it might be a good idea to allow her outside for brief periods on a harness this will divert her attention away from grooming and on to new interests which will also build up her confidence at coping with new situations if you are unable to do this make sure to set aside regular time every day to play and interact with her as this will help keep her mind off grooming while her wounds are healing they will itch and your cat is responding by grooming the areas and so the vicious cycle continues i don't know how well she tolerates wearing her cloth coat but if you haven't tried it already you might consider fitting her with an elizabethan collar to stop her doing this sometimes a tapering dose of sedatives prescribed by your vet in conjunction with treatment of the original psychological cause will resolve the problem if she's a particularly sensitive cat you may need to build up her competence levels so that she doesn't revert back to this behaviour should she become stressed again the web article below offers further advice on this subject http www bsava com virtualcontent if all else fails you may need to ask your vet to refer you to an animal behavioural therapist hope you find a solution good luck  Clinical depression Chronic fatigue syndrome Cat Insomnia Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Addiction Fancy rat Psychotherapy Allergy Milton H.

how do i get my cat to use the litter box again i can't get my month old cat to use the litter box we're had him since he was weeks old when we first got him he was fine with it then one day he just stopped using it a few months ago he hasn't used it since he'll jump in the bath tub and go there i have tried everythign i can think of to stop him i've ran water in the bathtub when i see him jump in there he'll just jump out until i turn the water off and jump back in he knows he's not supposed to he'll do it right in front of me or my husband and when we yell at him he just gives us a confused look the litter box is in the bathroom also i have two other cats and they use it just fine i am so tired of cleaning the bathtub but i don't know what to do with him by nature cats are fastidious and instinctively cover wastes with sand or dirt and indoor cats find a litter box suits this purpose well your new kitten wants to please you most kittens are litter box trained by their mothers if your kitten isn't accustomed to a litter box its your job to teach it what you expect and reward it for good behavior there are three factors to consider its ability to control its bowels and bladder its sense of home and toilet areas and how to communicate what is acceptable behavior to your new pet after you take your kitten home after meals drinks exercise or excitement gently place it in an easily accessible box filled with litter several times if necessary until it gets the idea after one or two tries in the litter box the kitten will usually become housebroken remember to praise the kitten lavishly for correct actions patience and continued loving care should handle any problems if your new kitten is sick with diarrhea or some other disease it is almost impossible to housebreak it at that time nurse it back to health and then resume its training order is important to cats changes in the environment including color or location of the litter box color or type of litter senility lack of sanitation odor of other animals on clothing a new animal baby or visitor in the home territorial anxiety in a multiple cat home a nearby female cat in heat moving or getting new furniture intact cats in the home stray cats outside the home change in the household schedule insufficient attention loneliness or emotional crisis in the family can all lead to litter box use problems if your cat stops using the litter box in favor of other surfaces in the home a veterinary examination should be your first step inappropriate urination is a common problem due to urinary tract disease or behavioral expression of feline displeasure occasionally the stress or discomfort of some non urinary tract disease will lead to this problem one rare cause is retained or remnant ovarian tissue in a spayed cat a sudden fright or too long confinement may cause occasional accidents common problems may arise if the cat doesn't like the type of litter its odor or its consistency experiment with several brands until you find one the cat likes the box may not be private enough or some object frightening to the cat may be near the box's location another problem may be that the litter pan is too small try different cat box fillers placing feed dishes where the cat has been urinating or moving the litter box to a quieter more private area if commercial litter doesn't seem to work try sawdust sand or newspapers with multi cat homes several litter boxes may be needed frequent cleaning is a must regardless of the number of cats make sure the litter box is accessible keep the location consistent keep the sides reasonably low for easy access keep it 'baited' but clean avoid scented litter or deodorants scoop often and change several times week spraying is when a cat marks a vertical surface with urine this is a form of territorial marking although cats with urinary tract disease will occasionally mark a vertical surface too the cat generally stands on all four feet lifts its tail straight up and squirts urine backward the erect tail often quivers just prior to and during the expulsion soiled areas must be cleaned thoroughly to destroy the presence of ammonia common solutions are those of equal parts white vinegar and water baking soda mouthwash detergents and clorox other products sold specifically for this purpose are available through local pet stores in any event the area must be saturated then blotted over and over again until all urine has been removed if the cat still refuses to use the litter box the confinement method is one alternative to retrain the animal once the cat is using the litter box regularly it is given more freedom it is important to select an area which is just big enough to hold the litter box at one end and the cat's bedding at the other give the cat no other area than a litter box for elimination apart from its own bedding the cat has to remain in the cage for hours a day for a minimum of two weeks after weeks of successful confinement allow gradually increasing periods of freedom close supervision is needed initially to ensure the cat doesn't revert to soiling outside the litter box when the cat is left alone continue to confine it praise the cat whenever it uses the litter box once the cat seeks the litter box on its own you can begin to feel confident that retraining is complete it is also possible to obtain drug therapy for inappropriate urination this should only be done through consultation with your veterinarian  Tobacco smoking Kitten Dairy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Stomach

getting a second cat i have a year old indoor cat who gets bored very easily and is always chewing up my things and trying to get out while i am working i was wondering if it would be a good idea to get another cat as a companion for him so they could entertain each other or will this only make his behaviors worst i don't need cats marking their teriroty when he was a kitten him and a friend of mines cat use to fight badly so i don't know if he can play well with others however that was before he was neurtered i just don't want to get another and have him kill the other cat while i am at work please any advice would be great never underestimate just how much cat values it's territory it is their source of food love and shelter when they feel threatened that someone is trying to take it away from them they can become very hostile you know your cat better than anyone and only you can decide if he is happy being an only cat or not the selection and introduction of a new cat always needs to be done slowly to minimise any adverse reaction from your existing cat ideally the new cat should be younger smaller and female as she would be seen as less of a threat more importantly the new cat needs to be confined to one room to begin with whilst your cat has free access to the rest of your home this reassures him that he is still in control of his territory cats also rely very heavily on their sense of smell and he will feel threatened by her scent because it's unfamiliar to him it's a good idea to let them meet each other by smell before any face to face introductions are made once she has the communal scent of your home on her things will progress a lot more smoothly the web site below offers good advice on how to introduce a second cat into the home http www tulsa animalshelter org tips intro cat htm good luck  Cat Dog Animal communication Fancy rat Ferret Garfield God Emperor of Dune Pet skunk Meme Socialization Phoebe Buffay's songs Felis sapiens Domestic rabbit Microeconomics Kitten Friends Cats (musical) The Critic The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Pitaten Little Britain Guinea pig Hamster World Wide Web Natural Selection (computer game) Python programming language Trademark X Window System Skunk English grammar American Black Bear Coercion EastEnders Albatross Spyware Brown Bear Bernard Williams Wget Badly Drawn Kitties Patriotism Ginny Weasley Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Scrooge McDuck Tokyo Mew Mew The Catcher in the Rye Nepeta Miss Saigon Ethics Galaxy Angel Sugar Glider Internet troll Traumatic incident reduction Abstraction Pretty Good Privacy The Apprentice 2 Feral cat Dean Koontz W.I.T.C.H.

what is wrong with him i've had this cat for months and it's been nothing but problems he howls constantly even when he gets attention food water he claws us half to death when we try to eat i've had to put him in the spare room for the night just to get sleep and when he's in there he runs at the door slamming into it and howling for hours straight i have to take sleeping pills just to sleep now he bites and claws when we try to pet him the vet said he's fine health wise but i don't know what to do i need some quiet and sleep i tried spraying water lemon juice yelling etc nothing works what can i do if this keeps up the landlords gonna make me give him away he is fixed we had him fixed as soon as he was old enough so that he wouldn't start spraying i got him from this person who's cat had kittens after the cat was given to her and she couldn't keep them the other one our friend took from her is calm and happy the complete opposite of ours i can't put the cat in the yard because the yard belongs to the apartment building not me where did you get him shelters cats and strays can be feral meaning they haven't been handled by people from a very young age and don't see people as friends they are essentially wild and don't appreciate life as a pet cats are also nocternal meaning they are the most active at night they don't understand that you want to sleep they have things to do so what to do consider cat proofing your fence and making him an outdoor cat give him a dog house for cover and let him be wild especially at night he'll be safe in the yard and not pooping all over the neighborhood  Cat Pet skunk Socialization Ferret Garfield Shaggy dog story Guinea pig Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Domestic rabbit Dog Fire fighting Feral Sin City Toilet humour Phoebe Buffay's songs Fancy rat Humphrey Bogart The Fairly OddParents Satchel Paige Skunk The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Rabbit Housebreaking Kitten The Smoking Room Friends Thermal power station Pitaten Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Feral child Lady and the Tramp Grandview, U.S.A.

i just got a new kitten how do i potty train her because on the search it says to put her in a cage noway the searches say to put the kitten in a cage with her food water and a litter box but i will not put her in a cage she has a free spirit and i have another that is already potty trained how old is the kitten potty training doesn't kick in until they are around weeks after that it seems almost instinctive to most cats put her poop in her box show it to her let her sniff use her paw to cover it with litter and let her jump out on her own she will catch on quickly hint for super young kitties it's helpful to have a few boxes around the house in different rooms they're just like little kids at first and can't hold it long enough to run to the box all the way on the other side of the house also get a box with shorter sides while she's small if she can't get into it she can't use it p s i agree with you kittens shouldn't be penned up to be trained caging cats makes them focus on escape not potty training the only exception is a stubborn cat that refuses to use the litter box but that's a different question lol  Cat Kitten Hamster Ferret Garfield Fancy rat RuneScape quests Toilet humour Professional wrestling match types Mixed martial arts Dog training Softball Pet skunk Trapping Sarah Kerrigan Housebreaking Chinchilla Xiaolin Showdown Dog Pitaten Tag B3ta Hello Kitty Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Joy Division (band) Aerial (dance move) Escape from New York Cat litter Glossary of American football Vegeta Disgaea: Hour of Darkness Poker jargon SpongeBob SquarePants Clouded Leopard The Inside Fox hunting Soap opera Big Brother UK series 5 Piccolo Junior Saga The Fairly OddParents Internet phenomenon Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Socialization Volleyball Japanese Bobtail (cat) Bengal cat Ren and Stimpy Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Brown Bear Crate training Drizzt Do'Urden House Mouse Suplex Days of our Lives Rabbit Professional wrestling aerial techniques Rugby union positions Ron and Fez European Rabbit Eddie Guerrero Trailer Park Boys Toilet training Atomic Kitten The Sims Siamese (cat) Good Times House of M Cuteness Cat Stevens Saw II Red Squirrel Toilet The Island (2005 film) The Catcher in the Rye Sluggy Freelance Tai shogi Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Asiatic Golden Cat Invader Zim Manx (cat) Jumpstart 3rd Grade Balinese (cat) Kurt Cobain The Cure Magic (illusion) Canadian football Nico Robin Feral cat The Ersatz Elevator Glossary of partner dance terms Triathlon John Cage Beat generation Janet Jackson Animal Crossing Starfleet ranks and insignia Equine conformation YuYu Hakusho

kitten help i want to get a cat one that will cuddle with me what breeds of cats are the nicest and best to cuddle with siamese and other oriental type breeds tend to be very affectionate no matter what breed s you're considering it's important to consider other traits as well perhaps a siamese would give you the level of affection you're looking for but the cat's incessant meowing could drive you crazy however you don't have to get a purebred to find the personality you're looking for with thousands of cats looking for permanent homes it's fairly easy to find a cat perfectly suited to your lifestyle and needs as long as you take your time and resist impulse adoptions purchases visit you local humane society or rescue group and ask the caretakers about the personalities of the cats better yet try to find a cat who has been fostered with a volunteer or an owner who must rehome their cat talking with someone who has actually lived with and cared for the cat will give you the best idea of the cat's personality although kittens are adorable and plentiful this time of year you will have a better idea of the personality of an adult cat than you will the future personality of a kitten  Cat Siamese (cat) Dog Feral cat Bengal cat Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Golden Retriever Balinese (cat) Rescue group Kitten Mixed-breed dog Treecat Manx (cat) Species Selective breeding Angora (cat) Lazarus Long Ferret Biology and sexual orientation Kakapo Turkish Van Theory of conduct Sphynx (cat) Purr Turkish Angora Horse Pet store Ecco the Dolphin Eugenics Puma Maine Coon Fancy rat Arabian horse Feral Guinea pig Cuteness Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Autism Egyptian Mau Social rule Alaskan Malamute Koko (gorilla) Human height Friendship Socialization Ragdoll German Shepherd Dog International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement Sinfest Infantilism Azumanga Daioh Garfield RuneScape quests Abortion debate Child sexuality Sexual orientation Livestock Alaskan husky Equine conformation Obedience training Person Show cat Domestication Minor Harry Potter Beasts Feral cat colony Economic inequality Lunar 2: Eternal Blue Complete Panthera hybrid Seabird Nature versus nurture Goodness and value theory Siberian Husky Internet phenomenon Animal shelter Animal rights Japanese Bobtail (cat) Tooth enamel One Piece minor characters Greyhound Keeshond Big Brother UK series 5 Hamster Asiatic Golden Cat Serval Randomness El Goonish Shive Life insurance Cornish Rex Saint Samurai Pizza Cats Inception of Darwin's theory Dog show Border Collie Robert A.

will neutering a year old tomcat stop some of the aggressive behavior toward my other cats i have cats and this new tomcat is aggressive toward all of them and they are hiding out in bedrooms will neutering this cat help the behavior getting him neutered will almost certainly tone down his aggressive behavior especially if it's directed at other males it's important to remember that testosterone remains in the body for up to several weeks after neutering so it won't be an overnight change after neutering confine him to a room for a couple days to let him recover from the anesthesia and surgery it will still be important to introduce these cats to each other slowly and with lots of postive reinforcement i e petting the cats and feeding them treats when they are in the presence of each other also make sure that your home has enough territory for six cats trying to make six cats live together in an efficiency probably won't work no matter how hard you try increase their territory by providing more vertical spaces for the cats such as cat trees and don't leave these cats alone together until you're absolutely certain they get along  Cat Domestic rabbit Castration Ferret Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Guinea pig Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Dog Hamster Feral cat Pet skunk House Mouse Socialization Fancy rat Dog training Sexual differentiation Kitten Testosterone Animal communication Prostate cancer Housebreaking Spanish pronouns Rabies Stomach cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Kakapo Garfield South Park Milton H.

how can you tell the differance between male and female cats when they dont have any parts cats most certainly do have parts even spayed and neutered ones spaying removes the ovaries oviducts uterine horns and uterine body but nothing changes externally neutering removes the testicles but even though you won't see those the cat still retains a scrotum a male cat keeps his penis inside of his body unless he's using it regardless of neuter status what you're looking at when you sex cats whether the cat is intact or spayed neutered is the space between the genitals and the anus this space is about times greater in males than it is in females however unless you have several cats to compare this distance can be difficult to assess unless you've sexed cats previously for people who are not accustomed to sexing cats another way of looking at it is this males look like a colon and females look like an upside down exclamation mark  Sex organ Castration Sterilization (surgical procedure) Intersexuality Penis Testicle Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Gender role Intersex surgery Cat Sex toy Sexual differentiation Ferret Human sexual response cycle Domestic rabbit Gender identity Feral cat Strap-on dildo Condom Scrotum Kitten Puberty Orgasm Sexual reproduction Anal sex Pubic hair Vulva Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female Sex assignment Prostate cancer Dog Platypus History of intersex surgery Human anatomy Transgender German language Erogenous zone Testosterone Gender Pornographic movie Grammatical gender Menstrual cycle Body modification Medical analysis of circumcision Circumcision Goatse.cx Latin declension Group sex Ovary Anatomy Gay slang Human sexuality Acanthocephala Male reproductive system (human) Pet skunk Man Female reproductive system (human) Genital integrity Housebreaking Anus Oral sex Cryptorchidism Female genital cutting Estrus cycle John Money Sex House Mouse Socialization Masturbation Gender-neutral language Vagina Latin grammar Polish language Vulgar Latin Romanian language Twin Homosexuality and transgender Human sexual behavior Czech language Virilization Sexual selection Gender reassignment therapy Uterus Endometrial cancer Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Genital modification and mutilation Androgen The Price Is Right Infertility A Star is Torn Penis removal Dutch language X chromosome Ancient Greek Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Danish language Safe sex Polycystic ovary syndrome

reason for early morning defecation in living room we have two siamese brothers with two clean litter boxes recently one of the cats has started defecating in the living room only in the early morning uses the litter box the rest of the day our vet suggested a pheromone spray which has not helped has anyone had this experience can you think of any reason for this behavior and how to prevent it pheromone spray is only supposed to help with urine marking not defecation if your cat is not old and has no underlying medical condition the reason could be stress stressors such as moving changes in routine or changes in the makeup of the family can result in inappropriate elimination reducing these stressors or decreasing their impact on the household will benefit your cat and probably you too cats of all ages may develop an aversion to the litter box or substrate material inside of the litter box some of the litters with a 'perfume' or 'antiseptic' smell may dissuade some cats from using them trying different types of litter including clumping litter sand newspaper and no litter are things that could be helpful some cats may not like where a box is located it may be located too close to their food or water it may be in a high traffic area where they cannot have privacy it may be in an area where they can be easily ambushed by another cat it may be on a different level of the house than where they spend most of their time in addition to trying various substrates also place extra boxes around the house to see if box location makes a difference there should always be at least one more litter box than the number of cats in the household some cats are very particular some will not defecate in the same box in which they urinate others will not go in a box which has been used by another cat just as we do not like to use dirty bathrooms neither do many cats if the litter box is not cleaned regularly they may decide to find a different bathroom  Hamster Japanese toilet Cat Urinary incontinence Domestic rabbit Fancy rat Toilet Toilet humour Pet skunk Post-traumatic stress disorder Housebreaking Cat litter Toilet paper Enzyme Diabetes mellitus Insulin Breastfeeding Tobacco smoking Kitten Diseases of the honeybee House Mouse Urinal Menstrual cup Urination Psychosis Fire fighting Natural Selection (computer game) Hypoglycemia Folic acid Menstrual cycle Guinea pig Tooth enamel Territory (animal) Friends Fecal incontinence Urine Daylight saving time Biology and sexual orientation Traumatic brain injury Sleep Glucokinase Carnivorous plant Schizophrenia RISC Japanese tea ceremony Alzheimer's disease Gas metal arc welding Perfume Alkane Waste management Clinical depression Surveillance Semiconductor device Microeconomics Classified information Jackass: The Movie Public good Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Glucocorticoid M16 (rifle) Albatross Thermoregulation Honeybee Acne Ionizing radiation Loudspeaker Hydrogen peroxide Psoriasis Biblical scientific foresight Vitamin C Marathon (sport) Human height Garfield Social psychology Welding Kitchen CPU cache Halitosis Tai Chi Chuan Body piercing Mouth ulcer Collision detection Stroke Colorectal cancer Entropy Richard Chase Manx (cat) Corrosion Migraine Basement Insurance Computer virus

my cat is going to explode everybody keeps feeding him i guess the neighbors is who that is i don't know what to do i hope he got them back by giving them fleas last night he was at the neighbors because we called and searched for him everywhere he doesnt like being inside he loves being outside during overcast skies or hot sunny days and he plays around early in the morning i just love that little rascal i agree with the person who said that you should talk to your neighbor simply explain that you are the owner of the cat maybe it was a simple misunderstanding and your neighbor thought your cat was a stray this does happen sometimes however i would not lie and say that the cat has a special vet prescribed diet if this is not true some cats do have these things to control health concerns even hairballs but starting off being dishonest will not benefit you your neighbor should simply respect that the pet belongs to a loving family and not feed it anymore or bring it into their home once this has been explained to him her that it already has a home additionally i'd like to add that if your cat is infested with fleas or not updated on shots you should immediately tend to this health concern treat your home by flea bombing it spraying carpet and bedding lice spray works well for upholstery that cannot be washed you can use carpet powders etc and shampoo your cat and use a flea collar for added protection you can also put the carpet powder into the bag of your vacuum if applicable and vacuum daily this will pick up eggs and the power will help to kill larvae and hatching adult fleas inside the bag helping to eliminate the spread and return of the flea problem this is something you should tend to as a caring owner because fleas can make your animal very ill i hope everything works out well  Flea Diseases of the honeybee Beetle Pet skunk Chicken Cat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dog training Domestic rabbit Feral cat Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Dog Ranma __ characters Mosquito Garfield Dairy Hamster Sea-Monkey The Amber Spyglass Upholstery Thermal power station Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an RuneScape quests Theory of conduct Stomach cancer Linked list Crab louse Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus A Course In Miracles Malaria Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Colony in Space Egg (food) Customs and etiquette of Japan Fecal incontinence Anopheles Tick Baylisascaris Sento Carpet Breastfeeding Social rule Fire fighting Shaggy dog story Shotgun AFI 100 Years series Kakapo Seabird Prostate cancer Red Hot Chili Peppers The Ark in Space Internal ballistics Plastic Jon Secada Biological pest control Mattress Past teachings of Prem Rawat Carnivorous plant Aladdin (1992 film) Scientology beliefs and practices Insect Chronic fatigue syndrome Bubonic plague Chocolate Tea Little Britain Siphon Shrimp farm Animal rights The Subtle Knife Medicine Pediculosis Ant Livestock Richard Chase Phoebe Buffay's songs Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) The Fairly OddParents Kodocha Coffee Transformer Infantilism The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Blood (computer game) Shark Care Bears Organic farming Blog Ren and Stimpy

how do these kittens see me yesterday i adopted a pair of three and a half month old kittens from an adoption service and they are very skittish around me their mother was definitely feral so it's reasonable to assume their father may be too these kittens act unlike any cats i've had before when i enter the room they're currently staying in they run for cover but will come out after i sit down for awhile as long as i hold still while sitting they'll eat drink and even use the litter box they know i'm there because they climb over me and sometimes react positively to a little petting but if i move they will head back to their hiding spot i've done my best not to move suddenly but no matter the nature of my movement they still react with fear i find this confusing since they seem comfortable around me in regards to eating playing and whatnot my question is how to these kittens see me a caretaker a threat a neutral party or something else also tips to help tame them would be great these kittens were adopted from a foster home where they seemed very happy and we were told that they socialized just fine with people as well as other animals they're still trying to figure you out for themselves you may be able to tame them all since they're pretty young all it takes is time i have noticed that being sure of yourself reassures animals move normally they'll get used to you you don't need to go around being so aware of them they'll get the pattern of your routine animals love consistant behavior and will get used to your movements just do your thing sort of ignore them provide their food water and clean thier box eventually they'l follow you around as kittens are fascinated by seeing thier litterbox cleaned they'll get that you're the mom  Cat Socialization Feral cat Kitten Domestication Hamster Dog Garfield Domestic rabbit The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Glossary of partner dance terms Pet skunk Feral Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Animal communication Guinea pig Kodocha Pitaten Ferret The Shining (film) Atomic Kitten Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Dog training The Time Machine Ron and Fez Kashrut Adoption The Amber Spyglass The Dalek Invasion of Earth Fancy rat Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Shaggy dog story Gray Wolf Conker's Bad Fur Day Spidey Super Stories Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Japanese tea ceremony Feral child Zagreus (Doctor Who audio) Pok__mon Live!

cat pee smell on mattress okay i researched other answers on here but it isn't the same as my situation i just bought a new mattress a few months ago a week or so after i bought it my cat pee'd on it she has done it two or three times since my daughter also had an accident on it i have just bought a waterproof mattress pad for future accidents i tried using several enzyme products including natures miracle nothing has worked does anyone have any other suggestions everytime i try something it just spreads the stain and smell now it looks like my whole bed is stained and it is driving me nuts my cat is no longer allowed in my room and i can not afford to purchase a new mattress this one as it is cost me over please help thank you for your suggestions so far i would turn it over but it is a pillow top and it is only on one side i want to try vinegar and baking soda i heard that works well but i don't know the ratio and application technique i have posted a link for the vinegar question the real problem is that the urine has sunk into the interior of the mattress if you cannot reach all the areas by the materials you wish to use you will not eliminate all the odors but you may be able to get rid of most and you will have to keep your cat out of the bedroom as they are prone to return to the scene of their 'crime' in time hopefully the scent will be reduced to almost nothing and nature's miracle has an orange scent the reason is that enzymes take time to work as they work by breaking down the odor causing chemicals in the urine cats will avoid orange scents in other words it will work if it reaches all the areas but it is not something that works in an instant  Mattress Enzyme Perfume Plastic Ron and Fez Alcoholic beverage Sulfur Menstrual cycle Fancy rat Upholstery Bong Drug test Toilet humour Photography Vitamin C Menstrual cup Urine Skunk Urinary incontinence Bread Olfaction Microeconomics Aromatherapy Tooth enamel Acetic acid Shaggy dog story Ben Johnson (athlete) Carbon dioxide Psoriasis Mark Guglielmo Sudden infant death syndrome Felis sapiens Cell (biology) Natural gas Radar Illegal drug trade Hamster Iron Tobacco smoking Penis Flatulence Hydrogen peroxide Cheese Japanese toilet Dairy Determinism Daylight saving time Diaper DNA Public transport Ammonia Breastfeeding Odor Prostate cancer Flood geology Brewery Seismic retrofit Pebble bed reactor The Shining (film) Donald Neilson Cancer Welding Angel One (TNG episode) Space Shuttle program Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Loudspeaker Transformer Cannabis cultivation Water purification Vinegar Land use forecasting Passenger car Bedbug The Human Stain Masturbation Animal communication Light-emitting diode Pet skunk Plame affair Dog $ale of the Century Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Natural Selection (computer game) Hydrogen economy Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Urination Surveillance Life insurance Insurance Plutonium OK Soda Albatross Hydrogen sulfide Migraine Manual transmission Diseases of the honeybee

i live in a house with cats and dogs they are all indoor pets and do their business inside i am constantly cleaning up after them i want to know can i ever have a couch we have a bench we put cushions on but if you leave the room one of the animals gets to them in one way or another do they make anytype of material that would be easy to clean if it was soiled and that is also chew claw resistant thank you all for responding i am going to look into ecah of your answers greatly appreciate it the problem with outside is that the one dog keeps hopping the fence and running away he keeps finding new ways to run away i know the problem with the cats is that there are way to many but i can't seem to convince the housemates of this fact wow with cats that a tuffy petco has an item that you can put on the corners of couches and chairs to help with the clawing it is clear material with a sticky back i've had cats for over years and i've found that the best material for a couch or other furniture is like a crushed velvet or something like that it's hard for the cats to claw for chewing you could use apple bitter spray it on the areas that get chewed i also just read something about vinegar you can spray white vinegar on areas where cats scratch or get on they don't like the smell i imagine that would work for chewing as well also you can use white vinegar after you've cleaned up any accidents that your pets have had the smell of the vinegar is supposed to keep the pets from re visiting the area i hope this helps  Fancy rat Hamster Pet skunk Cat Dog training Plastic Ferret Domestic rabbit Skunk Strap-on dildo Garfield RuneScape quests Dog Upholstery Tooth 2000 Australian Grand Prix Tooth enamel World War Three (Doctor Who) The Fairly OddParents Ren and Stimpy Taoism Tobacco smoking Chinchilla Billiards Shaggy dog story Catscratch Bulk vending Guinea pig Housebreaking Couch The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Red Dwarf characters Sin City Kakapo Weed control Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Pet Sematary Happy Tree Friends Social rule Cuisine of Denmark Acetic acid Big Brother UK series 6 Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Woodworking Dr. Seuss Brown Bear KaBlam!

why does my cat lick up the water in the tub after i shower i give them freash water but they still do it i have a cat who likes water from just about any source except her water bowl mostly she prefers to drink straight from a running tap and loudly demands that i turn one on for her but sometimes i catch her licking moisture off the tub my theory is that cats prefer running and or found water as in nature btw since your cat does do this use something pet friendly to clean the soap scum off the porcelain with you wouldn't want kitty to be licking the tilex off the tub  Customs and etiquette of Japan Soap Cat Textile manufacturing Trailer Park Boys Friends Garfield Dishwashing Licking County, Ohio Hard water Eric Cartman Taboo food and drink Water Fast bowling Tai shogi Dishwasher Dymaxion house Turkish Van Hamster Characters in the Smurfs Onsen Pottery Japanese toilet Laundry Taikyoku shogi Maneki Neko Sento Gay bathhouse Ren and Stimpy Water resources Water (molecule) Chinchilla Cookware and bakeware Toilet humour Cat litter Chinese tea culture Austin Powers Pet skunk Toilet Swimming pool Glycerin Tap water Ron Weasley Jackass: The Movie Washroom Tiger Hydrotherapy Genericized trademark Smegma Bottled water Fancy rat Nepeta Beer Happy Tree Friends Mutts Soap opera Mattress Poker jargon Hand washing Fecal incontinence Salad Fingers Our Gang Have I Got News For You Hello Kitty Tea Tenjiku shogi Domestic water system Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Hot tub Air pollution President (game) Texas A&M University Shampoo Domestic rabbit Super Bowl XIII The Cat in the Hat Lick Observatory Salt lick Car washing techniques Fountain Marine aquarium Plastic Peanuts Bong Coriolis effect Musical mode Tick Cat (Red Dwarf) Dai dai shogi Umpire (cricket) Phoebe Buffay's songs Plumbing fixture Maine Coon Red Dwarf characters Polyethylene terephthalate Moisturizer Kenny McCormick Felis sapiens Ice cream

lost my cat for weeks my outdoors cat has been missing for weeks and i'm freaking out he has been spayed and he was is an outdoors cat sometimes he'd stay out overnight or for long stretches of time but never more than a few hours i've already tried putting up lost posters in a few neighbors' mailboxes and at animal clinics but no luck so far i've also searched what seems to be like everywhere on my property and i call him everyday too hope is getting thin what else can i do for him and how long should it be before i really really worry about his life or what are the chances of him coming back alive and well at this point edit he's also declawed on his front two paws plus some relatives of mine visited stayed in my house for a month of so and he disappeared weeks after that so that may have been related to his absence they're gone now though he was originally an indoors cat for about a year after we got him i've had him for years but he meowed so loudly to get out everyday that i just had to let him out i trusted him to stay around our property which he did though he does enjoy wandering over to our neighbors' he's only been out for a few hours before he can catch birds and even sometimes drinks our pool water i know that means i need to provide him with higher quality water but i haven't seen any hint of that happening thanks to everyone that answered so far the chances of your cat still being alive are higher than you'd think but the chances of you finding him are slim sounds like your doing all you can and hopefully you'll find him there are plenty of miracle stories to give you hope you'll find him edit if he's been gone that long before that gives him a much higher chance i was assumming he'd never been away that long its not good that he's declawed  Shaggy dog story Social rule Poker jargon 2000 Australian Grand Prix Pet skunk New York Giants The Inside Housebreaking Dog RuneScape quests Hiking Ferret Ra (board game) Big Brother (USA TV series) The Joker's Wild Stomach cancer Animal Crossing Garfield Marching band Animism Swimming pool Tag Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Wheel of Fortune The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Dog training Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Luck Friends Richard Chase Kakapo Kitten Houseplant Knife Physical paradox Feral cat The Smoking Room Rose (Doctor Who) Goodness and value theory The Contender (television series) Extinction Rais massacre Sant Thakar Singh Snooker Gerald Durrell Roanoke Island Fancy rat Jon Secada A Day in the Life Catwoman Maneki Neko Doomsday argument The Pilgrim's Progress Socialization Avalanche USS Yorktown (CV-10) EastEnders Guinea pig Ocean's Twelve Domestic rabbit AFI 100 Years series Muslim ibn Aqeel The Amber Spyglass Species Prostate cancer Incarnations of Immortality Alex Ferguson Miss Saigon 2005 Belgian Grand Prix The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Ron and Fez Big Brother UK series 6 Avenue Q Singlish Terri Schiavo Mid-levels Drowning 2004 IAAF World Indoor Championships Cleveland Browns Jeopardy!

can cats remember faces i think so because when someone other then me comes to the door my cat peeks out from two rooms away and makes a brrr noise if he recognizes them then goes over if the person is new he is more cautious and moves very slowly because he is so far away from the person i believe he can see them before he smells them he remembered a visitor that he had only seen once before from two years ago this happened just last week i think it is a combo of the face and the person's voice and of course smell  Shaggy dog story Grandia II Cat Social rule Kakapo The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe John Layfield Joke Rose (Doctor Who) The Shining (film) The Star Wars Holiday Special Eggerland series What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

my kittens got frontlined over a weeks ago and i still see flees is this normal i haven't had a chance to de flee the house yet i'll start now though is this the reason why they still have them yes that is the reason the frontline kills the fleas as they are exposed to it but when a house infestation has occurred you will continue to see fleas b c there are constantly new ones hatching in your carpet and furniture and then jumping on your kittens stick with the frontline monthly on the kitties but get the house treated quick when your kittens first got fleas the fleas engorge with blood and lay hundred of eggs that fall of into the flooring bedding etc sometimes when you bomb or spray the house some of the eggs will survive and you may require a second treatment sometimes the best option is to have a professional extermination with a guarantee addition the pill is called capstar and is an excellent product that works immediately only lasts hours but good to use in combination with a topical treatment for the pet and house and yard treatment  Flea Bedbug Tick Ferret Cat Gypsy moth Heartworm Diseases of the honeybee Psoriasis Pet skunk Poker jargon Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Menstrual cycle Stroke Urinary incontinence Chicken Manx (cat) Head louse Penis Guinea pig Fancy rat Acne Kitten Tungiasis Antiretroviral drug Kakapo Zerg Anopheles Tag Black Death Prostate cancer Minor Harry Potter Beasts Feral cat Scabies Red Hot Chili Peppers Crab louse Carbon dioxide Ascariasis Blood (computer game) Hypertension Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Palace of Westminster Upholstery Shark Nile crocodile Domestic rabbit Carpet Garfield Final Fantasy XI Cancer Dragons (Pern) Polish September Campaign Baylisascaris Triage Suicide methods Xenomorph Malaria Oral contraceptive Diabetes mellitus Anthrax Sewage treatment Fire fighting Glossary of American football Multiple sclerosis Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Schistosomiasis Wound Folic acid Annuity Radiation therapy Pediculosis Sea-Monkey StarCraft: Hybrid Super Mario 64 Strap-on dildo USS Tunny (SS-282) Clinical depression Arab-Israeli conflict Pneumonia Antidepressant Sleep apnea Vitamin D Stairway Dog training Childbirth Bubonic plague Emergency preparedness Massage Atherosclerosis Beetle Flea market M16 (rifle) Betting (poker) Badly Drawn Kitties Swingout Veganism Acromegaly

kitty love or not my cat keeps on rolling all over my feet and purring he has fodd his litter box is clean is this just kitty love of somthing else this is the reason cat addicts are addicted your cat is saying thank you he just can't believe how delicious the food is and how wonderful it makes him feel and he is so pleased with the fact that his litter pan is clean so predators can't smell his excreta and locate him and hurt him he loves the view from the windows and how comfortable and soft all the places he snoozes and sleeps are the toys are just such fun and then there's you you wonderful you with your ear scratches and tummy rubs you from whose magical hands everything good comes he wants to bathe in you and be marked by you because that scent signifies the bond between you so he has found your feet not that your feet stink that is not it your feet are a body part with a particularly elevated scent so he is bathing in the scent getting it on him and probably marking them at the same time with his own and if he is rolling on your feet with his tummy up and the top of his head on the floor or on your feet he is in the position of greatest submission he is surrendering to you totally utterly absolutely you have an uninhibitedly loving friend for life and forever just go ahead and cherish this little guy there is nothing weird about this it is just cat talk and you really are a lucky person because a cat bonded like this will actually defend or protect you or help you if you should ever be in danger in a cat way of course but if it should ever happen you will never forget it either just tell him that you love him and rub his tummy with your foot he loves you  Cat Care Bears Dog Pet skunk Animal communication Hamster Cliff Richard Fancy rat Ferret Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Guinea pig The Shining (film) The Amber Spyglass Shaggy dog story Diving Rod Stewart Aerial (dance move) Mattress W.I.T.C.H.

my cat pees i have two cats and they are both about year and months old i got them both neutered about months back coz they were peeing all over the place and were getting nasty on each other altho they are both males although one of them has stopped peeing immediately after i got them neutered the other finds any opportunity to go anywhere he wants however he only pees and doesn't poo he has peed in my room and in all kinds of places i am growing sick and tired of this can someone plz explain how i can stop this from happening i am at my wits end note he tends to do it when the litter box gets a bit dirty let me guess it's the older one that's still peeing all over right that's called spraying dear and most unaltered adult male cats do it to mark their territory he's not sick he's not being spiteful and it probably won't matter how clean you keep the litterbox he's being a normal male cat and doing what his instincts are telling him to do since you got them neutered he may eventually stop this behavior but some never do once they start that's why it is imperative to get males altered before they are months old it's much easier to prevent this behavior than to stop it after it's started your best bet is to keep that litterbox pristine to make it more appealing for him and you must thoroughly remove all traces of his urine from your home shampoo everything and saturate it with white vinegar or a product made for this purpose available at any pet store to remove any lingering odors he will continue to go to the same places if he can smell where they are if you must keep the doors closed to rooms he favors after cleaning if there's one spot he prefers that you can't keep him out of place his food dish there cats won't pee where they eat you can try a product called indoor no for cats it's available at any pet store also it's supposed to discourage them from doing this sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't depends how determined your cat is citrus scented cleaners or citrus fruit peelings will sometimes deter cats they usually hate the smell just spread them around where he likes to mark try all these suggestions until one works at least one should if all else fails ask your vet for advice if nothing works with this cat you may have to look for a nice home in the country where there isn't much traffic or give him up to a rescue group or no kill shelter i hope it doesn't come to that and it probably won't usually if you keep after it you can find a way to stop it if you get any more cats in the future get them fixed by their month birthday at the latest and you won't have this problem good luck  Domestic rabbit Hamster Pet skunk Housebreaking Fancy rat Ferret Dog Guinea pig Animal communication Ron and Fez Sin City Ranma __ characters Skunk Pitaten Ron Weasley Theory of conduct Social rule Feral cat Friends Shaggy dog story Japanese tea ceremony Toilet humour Kitten The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Japanese toilet Poker jargon Jam (TV series) Toxoplasmosis The Price Is Right Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma CPU cache Betting (poker) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Perfume Cannabis cultivation The Inside Rocko's Modern Life Kakapo Sento Kim Possible Urine Jackass: The Movie Fire fighting Calvin and Hobbes Kodocha The Dalek Invasion of Earth Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Extreme Programming The Critic W.I.T.C.H.

my cat is getting mean he was really lovey when we got him but now he's always attacking he lunges at my face and my husbands face and he bites and scrachtes our feet in the morning he jumps at my face comes under the covers to scratch and bite me and jumps on me until i get up and feed him he is worse with me and i think it might be to get my attention to feed him we adopted him a month ago and he is kind of skinny what i am wondering is could he be hungry and that is making him mean i feed him a can of food a day and he always has a bowl of dry food and water out what do you think is wrong and what should i do if your kitty was once a stray he probably gets crazy when he's hungry he might think he won't ever get food again my kitty used to do the same thing after we brought him home from the shelter he still doesn't even chew his food just gulps it down make sure you are feeding him the correct amount of food and maybe move his evening feeding to a later time so he's not as ravenous in the morning both my cats were super lovey dovey when i first brought them home from the shelter that wore off after about weeks and their real personalities came through it is a combo of the pain meds from being fixed the upper respiratory infections and just being thankful they aren't in a cage anymore when my one kitty was at the vet for days recently with a urinary blockage he was soooooo loveydovey for days or so he just kept kneading the carpet as he walked around glad to be out of a cage and back to a good home i guess if you feed him more that is why he is worse with you it isn't meaness as the others said it is an effective way of getting you out of bed it will slowly wear off in time as he gets older and more comfortable with his surroundings i would also take him back to the vet and make sure he doesn't have worms or diabetes worms would keep him skinny with a bloated belly and would be hungry because the worms would be taking all of the nutrients same thing with the diabetes it could cause excessive hunger and thirst just give the vet a call with your concerns and see what they reccommend  Guinea pig Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cat Breastfeeding Hamster Garfield Domestic rabbit Ferret Shaggy dog story Sin City Urinary incontinence Piccolo Junior Saga Theory of conduct Pet skunk Equine conformation Hyperglycemia Diabetes mellitus Hazing Chicken Dog training Poker jargon Shark Dairy Kitten Aerial (dance move) Gastroparesis Blood (computer game) Fecal incontinence Prostate cancer Professional wrestling match types One Piece minor characters Worms weapons and tools Bat Boy Food New York Giants Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Tobacco smoking Diarrhea Pneumonia RuneScape quests Chronic fatigue syndrome Dog Eddie Guerrero Heartworm Dietary fiber Ultimate Spider-Man Fish farming Nutrition Conspiracy (TNG episode) Pump It Up Insulin Social rule Diabetic neuropathy Stomach cancer Spider Ron and Fez Coeliac disease EastEnders Fasting Obstetrics Kakapo Vitamin C Captain Thunderbolt Days of our Lives Aladdin (1992 film) Garlic Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Skinny Puppy Russian joke Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Avenue Q Babe Ruth Drowning Kodocha Common cold Japanese tea ceremony The Amber Spyglass Milton H.

baby kitten question i found a kitten what can i do to save it this morning i went out to do some shopping as i began to drive i saw a dead cat at my corner she appeared to have been hit by a car and was splattered all over the road then i looked and i see something moving not that far away it is a new born kitten its eyes aren t even open and it can t walk yet i picked it up and now have it at home what should i do with it obviously it needs to be nursed by a cat should i bring it to an animal hospital they should be able to take care of it can i feed it some kind of formula and attempt to save it myself the issue with that is i work all day right now it chirps probably calling for its mother i have brought the kitten to a hour animal hospital they will take care of it better than i could ever do on my own the nurse there said the kitten was no more than to days old since it still had a small piece of the umbilical cord i did not find any other kittens where i found this one hopefully it was the only one in the litter local pet stores or vet offices should have a formula that is made for kittens take the kitten to a vet to raise an orphaned pet is a very tiring but rewarding job you also need to know that after you feed it you need to gently rub its genitals to make it eliminate or it will die the mother does this for a few weeks after birth some vet offices may offer to take care of it during the day while you work my vet did when i lost my dog after she had pups good luck  Kitten Guinea pig Cat Ferret Domestic rabbit Hamster Pet skunk Pet store Sin City Childbirth Socialization Fancy rat Atomic Kitten Microchip implant (animal) RuneScape quests Dead Like Me Housebreaking Scooby-Doo Veterinarian StarCraft: Hybrid Manx (cat) Tick Neighbours Phoebe Buffay's songs Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Care Bears Pet EastEnders Feral cat Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kodocha Rabies Taikyoku shogi Brown Bear Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ron Weasley Azumanga Daioh Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Shaggy dog story Infant The Contender (television series) Barry Horne Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Social rule Knots Landing Midwifery Paul Is Dead Jam (TV series) Animal communication Fetus Shark Adoption Ralston Purina Company Obstetrics Everwood House Mouse Humphrey Bogart The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Gray Wolf Internet phenomenon Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Blood (computer game) Sexual reproduction Softball Cats (musical) Richard Chase Cuteness Louis Wain Giant Panda Dog training Goatse.cx Ayrton Senna RuneScape Random Events Killian documents Badly Drawn Kitties Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 T'Pol Golden Retriever Ron and Fez Hillary Rodham Clinton Neopets Delta Goodrem Premature birth Terri Schiavo Tokyo Mew Mew Xiaolin Showdown Mid-levels 1957 World Series Medicare (Canada) Serval Teacher's Pet (Disney) Girly Aphrodite

help my cat got out well about weeks ago one of my friends let my cat out she came back but starting acting really wierd she started to eat her own poo and now she has worms what made her do this i always keep the cat box clean i love this cat and i cant afford to bring her to a vet they want to charge me over is there an alternative other then giving her away if i knew that i was going to be broke years ago i would not have saved this cats life and i would have just let it die out in the cold if u want to be an a about it this is quite unusual i've heard of dogs eating their own poo and dogs eating cats' poo but not a cat eating it's own there are many reasons why a pet might choose to eat its own faeces such as dietary deficiencies anxiety an inherited trait or maybe because they just enjoy the taste the truth is that no one really knows why this occurs try ringing your vet and explaining the problem and asking if they have a product that you could add to the cat's food this may stop her from eating her poo otherwise when she does her poo i presume she's normally an inside cat you could sprinkle her poo with something nasty like cayenne pepper to get her out of the habit also you need to treat her worms asap that is the real problem here make sure you buy a good worming treatment really soon as it's dangerous for her and she could easily die if not treated good luck  Conker's Bad Fur Day Ron and Fez Taboo food and drink Fancy rat Hamster Dog Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shaggy dog story Garfield Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Guinea pig Chocolate Ferret Cat Anorexia nervosa Feces One Piece minor characters Stomach cancer Pitaten Insulin Ron Weasley Salad Fingers Shit Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Folic acid Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder The Fairly OddParents Fecal incontinence Diabetes mellitus Kakapo Hot dog Coeliac disease Lisa the Vegetarian Toilet humour Red Hot Chili Peppers Food Tooth enamel Traumatic brain injury Diarrhea EastEnders Ecco the Dolphin Animal rights Vegetarianism Veganism Rabies Borderline personality disorder RuneScape quests Obesity Piccolo Junior Saga Red Dwarf characters Kashrut Jewish cuisine Crohn's disease Omega-3 fatty acid The Cat in the Hat Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Unclean animals Sin City Cuisine of Denmark Nutrition Girly Futurama (TV series - season 5) Toxoplasmosis Chronic fatigue syndrome Kodocha Kenny McCormick Friends Timeline of alternative rock Hypoglycemia Neighbours Rocko's Modern Life Tofu Socialization Dave Lister Coprophagia Stuttering The Perishers Ascariasis Hedgehog Care Bears Korean cuisine Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Dog training Bread Manx (cat) Chile pepper Domestication Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Urinary incontinence Jonathan Archer Hearing impairment Phoebe Buffay's songs Vampire Diseases of the honeybee The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Docking

how far does a cat go from home i ask this question simply because my brother reckons he saw my mother's cat about mile away from her house cats are very curious and will go very far from home just wandering around neighborhoods it is possible for him to have seen the cat that far away we had a cat when i was growing up that went across town he had to cross railroad tracks and a busy highway but he was found there it's always possible that someone took him though could be the same for your mother's cat people tend to steal cute animals but the animals don't always want to stay where it's not home and will find their way back there are a lot of possible reasons for the cat to have been spotted that far away but be careful when you let it outside our animals become part of the family and are greatly missed when a stranger takes them and we never get to see them again  Ranma __ characters Hamster Azumanga Daioh Pitaten Shaggy dog story Chuck Jones Socialization The Cat in the Hat Kender Gunsmith Cats Animal Liberation Front Garfield RuneScape quests Girly Animal rights Kitten The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an West Side Highway Feral cat Lion Cat Light rail New York City Subway nomenclature Charlotte, North Carolina Richard Chase The Amber Spyglass Puma Pok__mon Chronicles U.S. Highway 1 Bengal cat D.N.

which pet is best to keep at home a dog or a cat and why i dont know whether it is a myth or not but i have heard that when dog is kept as pet it thinks that if any new person is born in family so he will get food from one more person as well on the contrary cat thinks if any person of family is died then it will get food of that dead person to her i heard this is the basic difference between a dog and a cat this view does not go away from my mind if i want to keep a cat as my pet since i love cats but my family members are forbidding me due to aforesaid reason suggest me okay if you are intelligent enough to use a computer you must be kidding on that whole mess you just wrote i surely hope your family is not that backward a dog is good if you want a companion to go places with you are home enough to let it out to do it's business don't take a lot of trips and can afford the vet bills and food i personally think it's cruel to leave a dog home alone more than hrs unless it's small enough to use a puppy pad to go or has access to a safe fenced area through a doggie door a cat is good if you are away more but want a pet who will sit with you quietly when you are home don't mind changing a litter box don't mind if the furniture gets a bit scratched and can afford the vet bills and food i'm a cat person but will consider a dog when i'm retired  Dog Cat Ferret Dog training Hamster Pet skunk Garfield Rabies RuneScape quests Cognitive science Guinea pig Shaggy dog story Housebreaking Sid Vicious Socialization Rent (musical) Social rule Dean Koontz Garfield (film) Phoebe Buffay's songs The Fairly OddParents Domestic rabbit German Shepherd Dog Chinchilla Pet Sounds Theory of conduct Care Bears Manx (cat) Obedience training Teacher's Pet (Disney) The Smoking Room Docking Ralston Purina Company Hearing impairment Cat litter Episodes of Lost (Season 1) S.H.E Flea Taboo food and drink Schr__dinger's cat Golden Retriever Japanese tea ceremony Royal Assent Fox hunting Greyhound Characters of Lost Pet Scooby-Doo The Cat in the Hat The Death Gate Cycle Joke Red Dwarf characters Gray Wolf Labrador Retriever Code: Lyoko Pig Abstraction Jiddu Krishnamurti Tick Krypto Border Terrier Border Collie Livestock Beethoven (film) Vampire Paul Is Dead Zoophilia Artificial consciousness Brown Bear Rabbit Azumanga Daioh Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Due process Cryonics KaBlam!

my cat often sticks his tougue half way out very cute but does it mean anything some cats sit or sleep with their tongue sticking out a little this seems to show relaxation and contentment whilst sleeping or if they are awake that the cat has become interested in something dependent on the situation sometimes it makes them look daft and other times it looks like they are concentrating whatever the reason it is cute  Sleep Garfield Diazepam Azumanga Daioh Pok__mon Snap Dream Red Dwarf Caffeine Cat Sleep apnea Humphrey Bogart Otaku Insomnia Paul Is Dead Dog Apollo 8 Tobacco smoking Garfield and Friends Ferret Happy Tree Friends Monty Hall problem Chuck Jones Ranma __ characters Felis sapiens Raphe nuclei Zagreus (Doctor Who audio) Gasoline Cuteness Lucid dreaming Girly Giant Panda Bhajan Sharia Urinary incontinence Krypto the Superdog Discovery (Daft Punk album) Seiken Densetsu 3 Coma Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Meditation Pitaten Hypnosis Tai shogi Bish__jo game Sleep debt Mike Portnoy The Fourth Way Gray Wolf Ed, Edd n Eddy Tom and Jerry (MGM) Snorlax Blink-182 Scenes from a Memory College Roomies from Hell!!!

very naughty cat constant meowing clawing it's miserable i have a year old male neutered cat i can't stand the thing he meows constantly all night long at my door if i let him in the room he meows and wakes up the baby month old i put him outside he literally ripped up the screens on the windows trying to get back inside the house he is a complete nightmare of an animal he clawed the rug under my door and shredded it up i can't put him in the bathroom he tore up the bathroom and ended up cutting his arm shoving it under the door hole and got a nasty infection that cost me to fix i can't stand this animal i've tried sprays to foils to water nothing works i even had him neutered to try to remedy i got a second cat for a companion too she's a good cat but he still acts up i am about ready to just drive it far away and dump it i don't know what to do the pounds here won't take in anymore cats i can't get rid of it please help i think he might have some type of personality disorder or ocd to make him do this i've never had a cat act like this before the worse of it's from am am he keeps everyone awake it's terrible he's done it before the other cat came n the picture and before the baby was born we shrugged it off as kitten behavior it's only gotten worse my husbands going to drive him out to the country if this doesn't stop http www petmeds com pdetail asp sk sp cat mg would i cut the pill in half if i was to try some anti aniexty meds it says mg per every lb of the cat he's about lbs so mg the pills come in mg half would be mg don't want to overdose he gets attention plenty of it it's not humane we have to have our screens shredded bathroom terrorized awake all night long etc we have tried everything for it craigslist doesn't do animal ads if i gave this animal away in this condition the next owner might not be so kind and just put it down if this cat turned it's aggressive ocd behavior onto our son omg so we want to find a cure for how this cat behaves or it has to get the boot my husbands friend lives out in the country on a large piece of land and he was going to drop him off there it's a lot better than a death sentance or the animal possibly hurting our son the baby is months old the cats been acting up like this since we got it as a kitten in april something is wrong with this cat i'm even willing to try medication but my husband he's had enough my son got scratched today during one of this cats fits we can't segregate the animal because he only hurts himself and our rooms put an ad on petfinder i doubt i'll get any bites on it but worth the try believe it or not you can use obedience training to help you with that keep him awake all day if he acts up spray him with some water and redirect him to something positive like a scratching post if he paws under the door slap his paws gently correction and redirection are key tell him no loudly to spook him and make him do something you want him to do use cat treats or tuna as a reward when he does what you want this method will take some time and patents but it works also try spending some more time petting and playing with him when he does what you want i also suggest cat care books  Cat Ferret Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Garfield RuneScape quests Dog Dog training The Amber Spyglass Sin City Social rule Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Rabies Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty One Tree Hill (TV series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Obsessive-compulsive disorder The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Jon Secada Poker jargon Characters in the Smurfs Codename: Kids Next Door Windows XP Housebreaking Feral cat Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist 2000 Australian Grand Prix EastEnders Friends Knots Landing Oh My Goddess!

does my cat have fleas i've noticed bugs on my cat's neck probably other places as well but that was the only place i saw since it's hard to get her to sit still in the past few days but she doesn't seem to be too bothered by them she's an indoor cat but we have outdoor cats as well which also don't seem to be bothered ths bugs are black and not too big but much different than pictures i've seen of fleas and larger so should i be worried if they aren't fleas then what am i supposed to do if they aren't fleas what else could they be just some random bug that has decided to nest in my cat's fur if so what can i do it's just strange because they aren't itching at all or anything not even showing signs of anything bugging them it does sound like fleas yuck you should act quickly if your cat comes indoors my neighbors house has fleas i found out because their son has red spots all over his legs we asked him why and he said fleas in his bed they multiply fast i read that over of fleas live in the house and only live on the pet sorry not to make you nervous  Flea Cat Dog training John Frusciante Domestic rabbit Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Missingno.

weird markings on my cat hi i recently got a cat from the rspca he is four years old and on his left ear has what looks like ink markings there are two half moons made up of four dots each and in between those two more dots there is also a hole on the tip of his ear before i adopted the cat i was told he was a stray does anyone know what these markings could mean thanks haven is correct it sounds like a neutering tattoo is the easiest way to know if an animal is entire or not makes it so much easier to peek in the ear of a scared stray to look for a tattoo rather than to a physical check on a male and with females the only way to know besides another op if in doubt ask the rspca the cat more than likely came to the shelter already neutered and so that is why it isn't as clear as if it had been done very recently  Violin Tattoo Dog Pet skunk Animal rights Grammatical gender Animal shelter Gender Rabbit Bulgarian language Polish language Elephant Hangul Ferret Sterilization (surgical procedure) Mickey Mouse Animal euthanasia The Time Machine Body modification Kakapo "Weird Al" Yankovic House of Leaves Pitaten Condom Domestic rabbit Castration Dutch language Who Framed Roger Rabbit Earring Czech language Hebrew calendar Spanish pronouns Autostereogram Gender-neutral language Shaggy dog story Blink-182 Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Badly Drawn Kitties YuYu Hakusho Gender identity Criminal tattoo Slovak language Oscilloscope Masoretic Text EastEnders Lion Guinea pig Bass guitar Vector (spatial) New Zealand English Printed circuit board Kangaroo Comanche Memento (film) Red Dwarf Kitten Social rule Homunculi of Fullmetal Alchemist Arabic alphabet Nine Inch Nails Hamster Leopard John Frusciante Ron and Fez Traditional animation Wolverine (comics) Mammal Shofar Action (physics) Drawing Chinese calendar The Death Gate Cycle The Price Is Right Socialization OpenBSD Quotation mark Theory of conduct Microchip implant (animal) Maka dai dai shogi Irezumi Code: Lyoko Treecat Maine Coon Fountain pen Naruto jutsu Tour de France Pac-Man Vulgar Latin Feral Dean Koontz Palindrome Panthera hybrid Prank flash Virginia Opossum Mnemonic Friends Rent (musical) Lady and the Tramp

why does my cat not always drink the water in her water dish i leave two bowls on water on the kitchen floor and i change them daily however my two year old female cat much prefers to drink from the bathroom faucet i know this is common but why cats especially like their water to be very fresh because you said your cat likes to drink from the faucet confirms this think about changing the water more often or buying a cheap water fountain they make for cats it keeps water circulating and keeps it from getting stale  Tap (valve) Sento Hamster Customs and etiquette of Japan Fountain Bread Japanese toilet Japanese tea ceremony Signs Kitchen Siphon Dishwashing Bidet Plumbing fixture Jewish cuisine Richard Chase Japanese cuisine Rum Soft drink Minestrone Maneki Neko Red Dwarf characters Russian cuisine Tea Drink Bird bath HVAC Toilet paper Cha chaan teng New Coke Maine Coon Sea water Disinfection Alcohol Dundas Square French cuisine Cuisine of Laos Breakfast Cuisine of Denmark Cat Plastic Drinking Swedish cuisine Urinal Fancy rat Kolkata Cuisine of the Philippines Nestl__ The Shining (film) Tap water Tofu RuneScape quests Hard water Turkish Van Hell's Kitchen (television) Gumbo Diving suit Turbulence Champagne (beverage) Tai shogi Bong German cuisine Bathroom Coffee Kakapo Cruising (maritime) Domestic rabbit Cuisine of Malaysia Humphrey Bogart Roman eating and drinking Solar power Friends Dim sum Cat o' nine tails Cuisine of Brazil McDonald's Iron Chef America Mosquito Dormitory Hogwarts Floor Directory Chatsworth House Teapot Chopsticks Spanish cuisine Toilet humour Milkshake Garfield Bloody Stupid Johnson Achewood Mathematician Ron Weasley In-N-Out Burger The Jim Rome Show Columbine High School massacre Paper Grog

cat genie litter box do you have one i have seen ads for this machine which is large and i don't like that about it but if it is as effective as it claims to be it would be worth the space it would take up does anyone own this expensive litter container and if so what is your opinion of its operation and cost to buy vs the overall cost savings i have used the litter maid unit and after about a year it didn't work anymore about i now use the petmate about which is also electric not as loud as litter maid but wastes more litter when shoveling into the receptacle it shoves good litter into it both were effective but required emptying the receptacle and buying more litter not a fun thing to do but better than standard litter boxes about any comments would be appreciated wel im gonna get a cat genie it cleans itself and doesnt waste litter it flushes the pee and poop out and everything then cleans the washable granules with water and sani solution it is really helpful and better than the other two  Hamster Jennifer Lopez Waste management Hydrogen economy Recycling Cat litter Make money fast Domestic rabbit Sewage treatment Litter Public good Autonomous building Japanese toilet Cat Composting toilet Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968 Hydroponics Toilet Telegraphy Nuclear power Energy development Kitchen CPU cache Flush toilet Nuclear fuel cycle Dry cleaning Outsourcing Dairy Urinal Poker jargon Service economy Menstrual cup Microeconomics Water The Best Page in the Universe Mac OS X Paul W.

a question a bout kittens and litter training i just adopted a week old from the pound and he has been very good about going in the box for the week i have ahd him but today when i cam home from work he pooped in a plastic grocery bag i had on the couch now i am worried he goes other places when i am not home how can i teach him that he should just go in the litter box not that plus other places it's hard to answer your question without knowing a bit more but if he's been going in the box already then he understands the concept and maybe he just needs it reinforced mama cats teach their kittens to go in the box by putting them in the box and then not letting them out until they go you might try that but it just might be that he pooped somewhere else because he was upset because he missed you he's still just a baby after all don't panic just keep at it consistency is the best teacher of all good luck  Pet skunk Cat Hamster Toilet humour Dog training Kitten The Contender (television series) Discordianism Socrates Ron and Fez Martial art Boxing training Shit Social rule Mixed martial arts The Jazz Singer Guinea pig The Catcher in the Rye Garfield Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Joke African American Vernacular English Milton H.

why does my kitty binx act so strange he's about months old we got him when he was about months old i found him in a box with another kitten ontop of a garbage can he runs around the house making chewbacca noises as we like to call it he runs outside when we open the backdoor then shut the screen door and he sits and meows by it until we open it to let him in then runs off again if you walk in a room past him he will run and wrap his front legs around your legs he will get really comfy on your lap and start to close his eyes then suddenly jumps off when he sleeps with my sister or me he only purrs when he is on the top bunk in the morning he wakes us up by purring and licking every inch of your face neck and does that little curling thing with his paws and if you try to cover yourself with a blanket he pushes til he finds a spot to lick he digs his head into a spot in you like an armpit or your neck til he gets comfy he will be very vicious and bite you then start licking you here's a picture of my baby boy http www cutelittlekittens com files images american shorthair thumbs t dsc jpg your kitty isn't strange he sounds like a kitten having fun growing up this is why it's fun to have a cat they do the weirdest things and serve as real entertainment as opposed to tv which is fake entertainment even half of the stuff you listed is enough to keep you laughing for hours and i'm sure you didn't list everything i love it when they take off running at warp speed and crash into things or when they pace around seeming very threatening and suddenly drop in place and fall asleep cats are hilarious  Shaggy dog story Professional wrestling holds Aerial (dance move) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Professional wrestling throws Garfield Milton H.

both of my kittens right leg hurts and they are looking sick what wrong with them first was the orange haired she started crying yesturday limping on her right leg and she wouldnt eat she looked really sick they other kitten was just fine i even seperated them and the good kitten went crazy i took kitten to dr she said it was insect bite i stopped letting kittens hide uinder dishwasher yesturday so today i let the kittens be together in my room they sleeped all day andi got the orange cat eating after nap the tyedye cat started having same symptoms as the orange at but more of the same limp as though there legs hurts what is wrong with them i already took to vet they said insect bite but why are both showing samw symptoms after one was diagnosed and not at the same area orange hair mingming went to vet while tye stayed home doing perfect vet said mingming got insect bite the next day after moving them from area where ct possible got bit they other cat tye started to show same symptoms vets call your vet and tell them about the other kittens symptoms did the vet check for felv and fiv sometimes this can be a symptom otherwise i found this less serious problem an example of a mild case is a kittenhood condition called limping cali having corresponded with a canadian cat only veterinarian several years ago when i first heard of this in some catteries and pet homes i will relate her views on this condition it is a strain of the calicivirus the most notable symptoms are limping and fever as far as the way a kitten contracts it some believe that adult cats who are carriers of this strain of calicivirus can transmit it to kittens while others believe that it is a reaction to the actual calicivirus vaccine itself usually displaying symptoms about a week after a vaccination even though some veterinarians may prescribe a mild antibiotic like clavamox augmentin for its treatment it will clear up on its own within hours without any medication at all during this time the caregiver needs to make sure the kitten is eating and staying hydrated with plenty of water it is also important to keep the kitten as stress free and quiet as possible limping cali can affect any breed of kitten due to its mode of transmission  Ferret Rabies Tuberculosis Cat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kitten Common cold Malaria Fancy rat Poliomyelitis H5N1 Chronic fatigue syndrome Pneumonia Stomach cancer Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome AIDS Ebola Domestic rabbit Asthma Smallpox Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder First aid Psoriasis Narcolepsy Rocky Mountain spotted fever Manx (cat) Group A streptococcal infection Influenza Cellulitis Schizophrenia Diarrhea Autism Paget's disease of bone Combat stress reaction Multiple sclerosis Garfield Sexually-transmitted infection Spider Decompression sickness Sleeping sickness Crohn's disease Chlorpromazine Stroke Hepatitis Cytomegalovirus Obsessive-compulsive disorder Herpes simplex virus Equine conformation Psychosis Sleep Breastfeeding Paracetamol Yellow fever Dog Phoebe Buffay's songs Veterinarian Controversies in autism Sickle-cell disease Hepatitis C Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Childbirth West Nile virus Traumatic brain injury Stuttering Eczema Clinical depression Cancer Sleep apnea Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Hamster Homeopathy Mumps Cardiac arrhythmia Palliative care Meningitis Tsetse fly M__ni__re___s disease Reflexology Epilepsy Allergy Bipolar disorder Leptospirosis Urinary incontinence One Piece minor characters Folic acid Insomnia Transsexuality Anthrax Puma Vaccine HIV vaccine Escherichia coli O157:H7 Alzheimer's disease

how much is it to ship your cat overseas we are relocating from california to great britain anyone have an estimate as to how much it will cost to transport our cat should we contact a pet transportation service to handle all the details i take it that you have already spoken with your vet about transporting your cat under the pet travel scheme if not then upon arrival in the uk your cat will be placed in quarantine for months at your expense you can use the services of a pet transportation company but with the help of a good vet you can also organise everything yourself you need to plan well ahead because a satisfactory rabies blood test result must be dated months prior to the cat arriving in the uk defra is the uk government body that handles all animal welfare matters below is a check list and fact sheet for all the requirements for your cat to enter the uk http www defra gov uk animalh quarantine pets noneuq a htm http www defra gov uk animalh quarantine factsheet eufactsheet a pdf most dogs cats and ferrets entering the uk by air will travel as cargo this is usually how airlines prefer to transport animals and it also should mean a smooth and swift delivery of the animal to the animal reception centre arc on arrival at the uk airport the cargo section of the plane where pets travel is a separate heated area away from where luggage is stored the pet carrier will need to be airline approved and should be large enough that she can lay down in comfort furrari make good ones with plastic food water dishes which clip to the bars of the door line the box with several inches of shredded paper and an old towel so that if she does get caught short the paper will absorb any urine if the box is large enough she'll be able to move away from the damp patch also put a sticker on the box with her name your flight details and a note asking someone to offer her water upon arrival my vet in the uk recommended against the use of any kind of sedative whatsoever he explained to me that it can make the cat feel disorientated and that if there is any air turbulence during the flight that my cat wouldn't be able to steady herself in her box some cats have been injured during flights because of this call the airlines to find out the costs of transporting your cat by cargo and then you simply need to add on the cost of the pet carrier and your vet fees you can then compare those costs against quotations from pet transportation companies book the flight well in advance because there is usually a limit to the number of pets allowed to travel on board an aircraft when i moved from the uk to cyprus i used a pet transportation company and their handling fees were not cheap i even got charged for simply having her box lifted onto the plane when i moved from cyprus to live in france for months i decided to handle everything myself and it cost me half the amount that i had previously paid good luck  Rabies Airport Hamster Hong Kong International Airport United States Postal Service Air New Zealand Airline Quarantine British Airways Ferret Boeing 747 Airbus A380 Ryanair Rafic Hariri International Airport Fixed-wing aircraft Domestic rabbit Douglas DC-8 High-speed rail Public transport Singapore Airlines Air Canada Space Shuttle program Delta Air Lines Air traffic control Singapore Changi Airport Shannon Airport Pakistan International Airlines Mattress Fancy rat Octopus card Japan Airlines Accidents and incidents in aviation Transport in Hong Kong Northwest Airlines USS Tunny (SS-282) Pan Am Flight 103 Aircraft Guinea pig Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Heinkel He 100 Airbus A320 Panama Canal London Congestion Charge Budapest Ferihegy International Airport London Heathrow Airport Pan American World Airways United Airlines Flight 93 Solar power Advance fee fraud Boeing Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Aer Lingus Continental Airlines Air India United Parcel Service Dairy Gas metal arc welding Concorde USS Forrestal (CVA-59) Refrigerator car Wal-Mart Car handling Solar cell Vickers VC-10 Scramjet Cat Energy development Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Air safety Taxicab Episodes of Lost (Season 1) MN Airlines, LLC Heinkel He 112 The Amazing Race Aeroflot Airbus Boeing 777 Air France Flight 358 Narita International Airport Housebreaking F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Hydrogen economy Oplan Bojinka Microchip implant (animal) Naval mine Credit card Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Airport security Royal Air Force All Nippon Airways Welding

hints for dealing w cat with a broken hind leg please no idiots saying put him to sleep my year old cat broke his hind leg last nite four bones are broken and he is in a large cast need hints for feeding pottying and general comfort this is my baby so be kind please dante was at the cat er early this morning just need the kind of advice the vet doesn't give how to make him comfortable both emotionally and physically dante was at the cat er early this morning just need the kind of advice the vet doesn't give how to make him comfortable both emotionally and physically poor guy sounds like you've already been to a vet since you know how many bones are broken and have had a cast placed your vet hopefully gave him some kind of pain medication like torbugesic or placed a pain patch fentanyl but not all vets will do this you should really just think about it from a common sense perspective make sure you have a litter box with low sides so he can get in and out easily your vet might have some cardboard trays often used in vets kennels as litterboxes for the hospitalized patients they are perfect for this situation just put plastic underneath use one a day and toss it after hours the vet might sell you them they are inexpensive that might help he will probably be able to get around fine i don't know where the breaks are where the cast is but if he cannot easily bend the leg elevate his food simply putting his food bowls on a box will make it so he doesn't have to crouch to eat lots of tlc it's said in the vet world that if you put cat bones in the same room that they will heal in other words cat bones generally heal well all by themselves with just a splint or cast so give him wks or so in the cast with one or two sets of xrays to make sure healing is going well and he should be good as new good luck  Equine conformation Cat Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Childbirth Dog Fancy rat Hamster Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Poker jargon Friends Pet skunk Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Medicine Galaxy Angel Stomach cancer Bone fracture Aerial (dance move) Dog training Ranma __ characters Tetrapod First aid Hip fracture Characters in the Smurfs Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Fast bowling Trailer Park Boys Days of our Lives Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Professional wrestling holds Customs and etiquette of Japan Housebreaking Something Positive Paget's disease of bone The Amber Spyglass Wood carving Tlingit Insomnia Pitaten Traumatic incident reduction Plastic Stereoscopy Homunculi of Fullmetal Alchemist Psoriasis Sin City Oh My Goddess!

cat has fleas the baby kitten we just got has fleas and i have searched all over looking for help we have another cat and a dog and dont want them to spread we have quarantined the kitten into one room only we have also used the original dawn soap in baths which was supposed to drown fleas by only seems to stun them making them easier to pick off any advice for rideing them from the cat and house i've seen people say use bombs but also seen don't b c they just burrow further and come back when its gone also i've seen some people say they themselves have been infested with fleas and others say they were just bitten and if infested not with cat fleas but human fleas any advice on this matter will help please ask your vet about capstar this is a pill that you can give up to once a day and it will kill all the fleas on your pet i don't remember exactly the age your cat has to be to use it but your vet could help with that it's prescription only also ask about frontline and advantage both are safe in kittens at the right dose and kill adult fleas within hours i would also use advantage or frontline on your other cat and dog for a month or two just to be on the safe side you can use a general pyrethrin based flea spray around the areas where your cat has been on the carpet and under furniture also once you treat your pets you can vacuum the areas and then right away throw out the vacuum bag in your outdoor garbage can that will pick up most of the eggs that have been laid you probably caught this problem quickly enough that it won't become a huge deal flea bombing is very much obsolete with these new products that have become available in the last yrs fleas will only feed on humans if the animals aren't available to them or you are extremely flea infested they much prefer your pets good luck by the way many of these products are available online cheaper than at your vet try bestpetrx biz or petmeds com  Flea Cat Bedbug Pet skunk Ferret Fancy rat Heartworm Rabies Dog Domestic rabbit RuneScape quests Socialization Feral cat Kitten Tick Chicken Hamster Livestock Diseases of the honeybee Puma Zerg Theory of conduct Dog training Garfield Pet Housebreaking Beetle Chinchilla Toilet humour Breastfeeding Shaggy dog story Gypsy moth Head louse Illegal drug trade Phoebe Buffay's songs Treecat Blood (computer game) Donald Rumsfeld Rabbit Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Social rule Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Menstrual cycle Dairy Ascariasis Skunk Sarah Kerrigan Spidey Super Stories Sin City Canary Scabies Rat Pet store DDT Red Hot Chili Peppers Internet phenomenon Feral Manx (cat) StarCraft: Hybrid Bubonic plague The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Anopheles Soap opera Myxomatosis Atomic Kitten Malaria Veterinarian Taboo food and drink Spider English grammar Wombat Jam (TV series) Combine (Half-Life 2) Diazepam The Fairly OddParents Xenomorph Baylisascaris Girly American Alligator Plastic Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Coprophagia Animal rights Bat Ren and Stimpy Hearing impairment Kakapo Softball Tiny Toon Adventures Animal Crossing Ozzie, Slash, and Flea Childbirth Linked list Hyperthermia StarCraft Secret Missions Krypto the Superdog Spirited Away USS Waters (DD-115)

my indoor cat suddenly had a bubble on her face she han't been social hiding in the basement since today she has a nasty furless slimy mess on her face i am a single mom of young kids and can't afford a vet bill for something simple does anyone know what it might be or if it is puting my kids in harms way i am not a moron i am at my neighbours house using her computer and internet trying to find helpful advice before this becomes fatal it doesn't sound like something simple or that can be treated at home so i'm afraid i'll have to recommend you take the cat to a vet my guess and it's only a guess is that the lesion on her face is from a spider bite the fact that it is a slimy mess indicates that the venom is actually dissolving her flesh it will not heal on its own as you can imagine this is very painful in fact it may fall into the realm of animal cruelty if you don't get it treated it is no danger to your kids but if it is a spider bite your kids might encounter the same spiders  Spider Cat Blood (computer game) Pet skunk Fancy rat Minor Harry Potter Beasts Calvin and Hobbes Hobo spider Tarantula Ferret First aid Venom (comics) Venom (poison) The Human Stain The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Australian venomous funnel-web spider Troll Zoophilia Naruto jutsu KaBlam!

is it normal for a new mother cat to breath rapidly my cat just gave birth hours ago and has lovely babies that seem healthy it's not them i'm worried about olivia my cat is female unsure of the age because we found her on the street she must be around and not over weight except for the weight brought on by the pregnancy i'm really scared because the average cat breathes anywhere from breathes a minute she is breathing more around from my last count is it normal for a new mother to breathe this way rapid breathing when the cat isn't using a lot of energy is a sign of being in pain your cat shouldn't be in pain hours after delivering her last kitten breathing that fast is clearly a sign of trouble i suspect that she still has more kittens inside her and for some reason can't deliver them sometimes a retain placenta causes pain and infection but that usually crops up in a previously healthy seeming cat a few days after delivery i strongly recommend taking your cat to the vet so he can check her take her kittens along too in case she has to stay overnight  Childbirth Obstetrics Pregnancy Guinea pig Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Diabetes mellitus Caesarean section Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Asthma First aid Decompression sickness Urinary incontinence Toxoplasmosis Cytomegalovirus Menstrual cycle Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Premature birth Fancy rat Kitten Hypoglycemia Phoebe Buffay's songs Domestic rabbit EastEnders Birth weight Coeliac disease Manx (cat) Psoriasis Twin Group A streptococcal infection Swimming Placenta Breech birth Multiple sclerosis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pulmonary embolism Miscarriage Hyperthermia Folic acid Knots Landing Respiratory rate High-heeled shoe Ron and Fez Pneumonia Shaggy dog story Darth Vader Placenta praevia Friends Paracetamol Gonorrhoea Garfield Prostate cancer Abortion debate Thermoregulation Insulin Sleep apnea Partial-birth abortion Amniotic sac Characters of Naruto Jon Secada Herpes simplex virus Socialization Purr Myocardial infarction Girly Diazepam Dean Koontz Virgin Mary in Islam Medical prescription Fetus Dieting Abortion Cocaine Fertility awareness Vitamin C Rabies Lung cancer In vitro fertilisation Chlorpromazine Duchenne muscular dystrophy Social rule Glycogen storage disease type I Theory of conduct Nerpa Drowning Sickle-cell disease Liquid breathing Pet skunk Lethal injection Tobacco smoking Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Cancer Sluggy Freelance HIV test Diabetic retinopathy

year old cat licks month old kitten's bum should i take this as a good sign the older cat is a girl and kitty is a boy we introduced kitty into the house about weeks ago do they like each other usually they play fight very rough or ignore each other i want them to groom each other and sleep close older kitty is spayed and kitten will be soon we just want to put more weight on him it is a good sign your older cat is mothering your kitten when kittens are newborn they don't poop on their own as gross as it sounds the mama kitty licks their bottom to stimulate their bowels and swallows the poo it's just a processed version of her own milk after all i doubt your older cat is ingesting any poo she's just mothering him my other take on the situation is if your older cat is not spayed she may be reacting to the smell of a male get her spayed as soon as possible if she's not already or you'll have kittens before you know it also get the kitten neutered in the next couple months or he'll start marking around the house as in peeing on the walls and once male cats start that it's very hard to get them to quit even after they've been neutered good luck  Cat Kitten Ferret Guinea pig Ron and Fez Feral cat Socialization Garfield Toilet humour Breastfeeding Domestic rabbit Manx (cat) The Price Is Right Badly Drawn Kitties Pitaten Pet skunk Shit Oral sex Salad Fingers Flatulence Felix the Cat Puberty Housebreaking Urinary incontinence Phoebe Buffay's songs Castration The Sound of Music South Park Bulgarian language Conker's Bad Fur Day Girly Friends Vomiting The Jazz Singer Doug Chocolate The Beatles bootlegs Shrek 2 Marc Antony and Pussyfoot AFI 100 Years series Ranma __ characters The Contender (television series) The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Goatse.cx Cats (musical) Felis sapiens Social rule Kangaroo Eric Cartman Garfield and Friends Kurt Cobain The Marshall Mathers LP Little Britain Purr Sterilization (surgical procedure) Poker jargon Kakapo StarCraft: Hybrid USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Methcathinone Red Hot Chili Peppers Catgirl Hobo Kenny McCormick Something Positive Puma Donovan RuneScape quests European Rabbit Aquemini Atomic Kitten Grammatical gender Luck 2000 Australian Grand Prix Blink-182 Tina Turner Big Brother UK series 5 Elektra (comics) Joke Dean Koontz Milk Nile crocodile Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Okashina Okashi El Goonish Shive Polish language Coeliac disease Ren and Stimpy Silly Symphonies Black Bob Barker Trailer Park Boys Bat Ginger Rogers Mnemonic

my cat im scared i put my cat outside and its an indoor cat and its like to years old ad its scared i put water and food out for him but im scared he wont eat it and just die will he be ok and idc if it was right or not for me to do it i just dont like how hes a mean cat but i still want to keep him will he stay by my house and let us feed him a nd shit or will he wonder away either way i dont care i just dont want him to die he wont get hurt unless he gets run over cuz hes really mean nd has claws wat will happen hes under a bush right now i jsut put him out here its his first time ever outdoors why did you put him outside he's probably terrified imagine if someone took you out of your house and put you out in the forest or the desert if you put him outside because he's a mean cat can't you just let him live in the house and not do whatever makes him mean even if that means you just ignore him i have a cat who is unapproachable and unpettable essentially she's a feral cat who lives in the house she bites and scratches but i wouldn't put her outside to try to survive no he won't be all right he'll cower there under that bush till some predator attracted by the food you put outside for him kills him there are doubtless some homeless cats that are already in your area they will find him in their territory and fight him till he runs away probably injured probably infected with the diseases unowned uncared for cats carry he won't be able to find food elsewhere and he doesn't know how to hunt he'll starve if he isn't killed first by dogs or foxes or coyotes or run over or shot by someone who hates cats or dies of disease you owned him for four or five years you owe it to him to take him to an animal shelter he probably won't be adopted no one wants a mean adult cat but he will get vet care and food and a safe place to sleep and ultimately a quick painless death i don't understand why you put the cat outside and are now so concerned about him did your parents throw him out  Cat Dog Ferret Feral cat Kakapo Pet skunk Hunting Brown Bear Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Gray Wolf American Black Bear Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Socialization Lion Garfield Jon Secada Animal euthanasia Hamster Singlish RuneScape quests The Critic Pitaten Jam (TV series) American Alligator Theory of conduct The Marshall Mathers LP YuYu Hakusho Organic farming Livestock Feral Treecat Humphrey Bogart Tick Ranma __ characters EastEnders Tasmanian Devil Puma Characters of Lost Sin City The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Kodocha Fox hunting Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Pok__mon Live!

why does my cat insist on waking my wife and i up really early in the morning my wife and i have two cats that are spoiled rotten with love and attention they are healthy smart and beautiful cats one is a female a bit overweight but wears it well the other is an athletic male tabby cat he seems to want to get us up with the sun each morning funny thing is its not to feed him he's not a big eater like the female and she could care less when we get out of bed so why does this male cat insist on waking us up at sunrise every morning he is not trying to go to the bathroom a litter box is always available to him and he never seems to do that when waking us up he just wants to hang out with us one theory i have had is that he is warning us of possible dangers that could come with the day like being seen or smelled of course everything cats do is ultimately about avoiding being preyed upon or to prey on others cats are selfish and social when they choose to be social and then there are times they choose to be unsocial that's why i don't like cats too well even though i have one when my cat is up he wants us up and has no concern for our need for sleep he just knows he wants attention and to be played with he's up and we should be too that's his rational so we started teaching him that he does not dictate when we get up and that if he's awake fine but be awake and entertain yourself or go back to sleep we scold him for meowing and other forms of getting our attention and if he needs food we give it to him but try to make sure the bowl is full the night before so it won't be empty too early sometimes we'll scold him and shut him out of the bedroom as to say you are misbehaving and don't belong in here right now  Cat Sin City Hamster Phoebe Buffay's songs Sleep Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Friends Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Animal communication Garfield Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten Insomnia Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Minor Harry Potter Beasts Dream Humphrey Bogart Odyssey Ferret Jon Secada Domestic rabbit Characters in the Smurfs Elvis Presley Spider Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban SpongeBob SquarePants The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Tom and Jerry (MGM) Mountaineering Monster Rancher monsters Dog Kurt Cobain Fancy rat AFI 100 Years series Urinary incontinence Lion Ron and Fez Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Felis sapiens Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Bat Characters of The Sandman Social rule Japanese tea ceremony The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Out-of-body experience Mattress Dean Koontz Robert A.

big kitten or small kitten what about health hello i need help in deciding which kitten to adopt there are that we like one is normal size and sturdy the other one would be perfect personality he is really small even though he is from the same litter as the sturdy one they both have high energy the reason i am afraid of getting the small one is my uncle adopted a small puppy smaller that his siblings after a while he stop growing the vet said that he dog has a heart condition and he can t get excited and might not live as long as a healthy dog on the other side my cedrick my baby of yrs that just passed away was the smallest of his litter he was small he took him home and after a few years he was over lbs i don t know both their personalities are great the big one is a hyper cat and cuddles the small one is more reserved and affectionate and comical what do you think i'm getting a pure breed they are expensive in addition i just lost my baby really i love him so much and miss him i still cry every night he his was my best companion i do not want to go through more emotions soon the runt of the litter does not always mean that it is sickly however sometimes it does here are a few things to look for the kitten should be friendly and alert eyes clear and bright ears clean and dry nose damp etc and most importantly approach you readily if there is any doubt to any of these then pick the other kitten if you're getting it from a breeder they should also be able to give you some indication as to any potential problems one other thing the smaller kitten will always be smaller again not that this is always bad but if you want a larger cat it's something to consider  Dog Cat Ferret Hamster Guinea pig Pet skunk Havanese Manx (cat) Labrador Retriever Fancy rat Dobermann Kitten Atomic Kitten Gray Wolf Beagle Treecat Socialization One Tree Hill (TV series) Docking Border Terrier Pet store Pitaten Dog show Care Bears Rabbit Whippet Mixed-breed dog The Tick Bengal cat Diving Girly Balinese (cat) Dog breeding Social rule English Springer Spaniel Dean Koontz Doug Housebreaking Cats (musical) Livestock English Cocker Spaniel Infantilism Feral cat Chaos Emerald Hearing impairment Characters in the Smurfs Childbirth Jack Russell Terrier Chihuahua (dog) Shaggy dog story Puma Combine (Half-Life 2) Puppy mill Ranma __ characters Siamese (cat) Great Dane Tobacco smoking Zuiderzee Works Garfield Jon Secada Cheetah Dog training Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma American Kennel Club Dai dai shogi Boston Terrier Breed registry Cornish Rex Breastfeeding Border Collie Turkish Angora Thermoregulation Skye Terrier Black panther Violin Smooth Collie Loudspeaker Species Equine conformation Sphynx (cat) Rottweiler Jack London Basset Hound Finnish Spitz Liger Pekingese Scooby-Doo American Eskimo Dog Chlorpromazine German Shepherd Dog Keeshond Max Martin

we are adopting a kitten and are concerned about the furniture should we declaw we are concerned about the aftereffects on the kitten when a cat is declawed the vet does not removed his fingernails the vet amputates his fingers at the first joint some people consider this a mutilation and i think the aspca agreed with that assessment several years ago claws as you know are a cat's first line of defense and also the way they catch their food they snag it when the claws are removed in declawing the cat moves to his second line of defense he bites and declawed cats often become biters so people then have them defanged that may be okay for indoor cats but indoor cats regularly shoot out an open door or meander out into a summer night through an open window and either don't or can't find their way home a defanged and declawed cat without a home is a helpless creature who can neither defend himself nor hunt when cats sharpen their claws which is the thing they do to furniture that leaves it in tatters they are not sharpening their claws at all the claws grow from a cuticle at its base just as do your fingernails only they grow faster and the cuticle pulls at the claw as it grows this is apparently an uncomfortable sensation so the cat digs its claws into a treetrunk or an overstuffed chair and pulls to loosen the cuticle and free the claw there is also an emotional clawing you pull out a fun toy or the cat hears your footsteps coming down the hall and the cat excitedly digs in to the scratching post or carpet just inside the door you do not have to have your cat declawed to keep him from scratching the furniture all you have to do is trim his claws his front claws once every week to ten days there are cat claw clippers available at pet supply stores and all the cat care books tell you not to use human toenail clippers because they can split the claw but i always used human toenail clippers if you buy the professional ones you can trim down closer to the quick but i was always a coward about getting too close to the quick i just took off the points here's what you do you sit the cat on your lap and i do mean sit him with his backbone perpendicular to your pelvis and parallel to your backbone and his back against your tummy then push in on the palm of his paw to express his claws and just clip the points off his claws if you train your kitten to expect this he will never cause you a minute's problem my cat used to sit like a gentleman in a spa for his weekly manicure we did it every sunday when you remove the points from your cat's claws his claws cannot pierce your furniture and if he should be playing with you and play smack you on the face his claws cannot pierce your skin either still your cat does need to sharpen his claws so you should get him a scratching post and because his claws are no longer rapier sharp you need to get him a scratching post made of a material that his claws will be able to dig in to so he can loosen the cuticle so you get him a good sisal scratching post you can buy him the traditional sort of phallic scratching post with a nice wide base so he can get a good tug when he digs in to the vertical piece but they also have these sisal i don't know what to call them humps like an upside down kind of flattened u with a little effort you can mount one of these on the wall just above the baseboard in the room he will haunt the most in addition to the mainstay scratching post i also bought a bunch of those cardboard three inch wide cheapie scratching posts and mounted them on doors just beneath the doorknob using double stick mounting tape in rroms where he would do emotional scratching like on the entry door rub all the scratching posts with catnip so he smears his scent on them and that is how you avoid a vet bill for surgery and train your cat to scratch his furniture and not yours it really really works too  Nail (anatomy) Volleyball Ferret Pet skunk Manicure Hamster Knife Upholstery Strap-on dildo

i just got a new kitten but she's very scared it's been about a day since we brought her home and she won't come out without us pulling her out from under my bed if we let her go she immediately goes under the bed or under something else is this normal is there any way i can make her feel more comfortable or safer so she'll come out how long might this take give her time this is pretty common for a new cat wait for her to come to you pulling her out is just going to freak her out more keep some treats near by so you can reward her when she does come out it may take a few days for her to settle in  Dog training Cat Time Out of Mind Strap-on dildo Mattress Milton H.

what is up with my cat i have a year old female cat who's been acting weird lately just days before i got the dog she sensed something was up i didn't have the cat bowl in the house anymore she was more affectionate and clingy to me letting me hold her longer than usual so when we got the puppy a breed that loves cats she's been acting like a wild cat she'd be knocking baby gates down pounce on things and run like lightning while the dog was in the other room sleeping why would she do this is she upset another animal is sharing her domain she doesn't like dogs much she chased a stray lab a big dog not a puppy off of her property lol and it ran but the puppy is waiting for the cat to warm up to him cats can tend to be more territorial than dogs have a reputation for and cats are very temperamental animals it takes them a while usually to warm up to changes in their household and yes she's having to share the space and affection with you with another animal so she's reacting to that as well it's just one great big stressful situation for her and that's why she's darting around the house spacing out as it were the best thing for you to do is keep the two away from each other for a while reassure you kitty that you're still here for her and that she's still number one spend one on one time with her playing with her talking to her and giving her her favorite treats or food a couple of times in solitude away from the dog it'll take some time but she will probably eventually warm up to having someone else in the house you and the dog are just going to have to win her trust again good luck  Dog Cat Housebreaking Garfield Ranma __ characters Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog training Pitaten Characters in the Smurfs Lady and the Tramp Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Kim Possible Shaggy dog story Animal rights Maison Ikkoku Labrador Retriever Miss Saigon Kodocha Pet skunk Ren and Stimpy Trailer Park Boys Skinny Puppy Ferret Scooby-Doo 101 Dalmatians: The Series Socialization Hamster RuneScape quests Poker jargon Girly Friends Fancy rat German Shepherd Dog Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Great Teacher Onizuka Guinea pig Jennifer Lopez Golden Retriever Shetland Sheepdog Social rule Game show Domestication Kakapo Billboard Hot 100 Black Pete Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography God Emperor of Dune Dean Koontz AFI 100 Years series W.I.T.C.H.

we just adopted a kitten yesterday but he's a biter how can we get him to stop biting it's not just little love bites he wants to eat our fingers he has plenty of food so he's not hungry he is weeks old is this just a phase or something we should worry about also we have an older cat in the home too but they haven't really met yet we're still working on that any suggestions he doesn't know better and has lots of energy you don't punish him but you teach him he needs to learn that fingers hands and feet are not objects to bite when it happens you react gently and you need to get his attention sometimes a very gentle tap on the nose followed by the word no works other times grab his feet and gently tap his nose and say no sometimes a play session afterwards amplifies the training but not too quickly or he will associate biting with being rewarded now to the second part your older cat cats usually abhor changes and you have brought a massive change expect a lot of hissing and growling but that is usually for show in addition get a second litter box if there are not already two your older cat is alpha and will want to remain alpha your kitten will be turbocharged and your older cat may not be happy with that it can take anywhere from days to a couple of months before any definite conclusions can be had if there is a wide age difference actually consider getting a second kitten the kittens would then take out all the energy out on each other allowing your older cat to adjust but if it is only several years or so things should settle down all right and by the way child proof your house as your kitten will want to get into and onto everything  Cat Dog training Ferret Pet skunk Domestic rabbit Milton H.

my kitten won't eat my cat had a litter of kittens wks ago but one of them won't eat i was advised to put the food in her mouth but she's still not interested i am worried cause she's smaller then the others and theres no chance of rehoming her yet either she still has milk from her mom but not much who can help it sounds like your kitten is the runt of the litter that would explain why he she is smaller than the others often runts have a harder time getting food because they are smaller than the other kittens and get pushed about what you can do is to try all the time if he she eats some and then refuses don't push him her to try to get him her to eat again wait a bit and try again later remember to always finish the feed on a relatively good note because that's what he she'll remember from it don't try again and again because this will leave a bad memory and he she may refuse any further food from you you can buy special kitten feeds in most pet shops you can also watch to make sure his her brothers and sisters are leaving him her alone and if you identify one he she particularly likes you can try feeding them together because often kittens follow each others' example also if one kitten is being particularly rough with him her you can seperate them so that he she feels better one sure way to get it done right is to ask your vet to try and then get some advice on what you can give him her also if he she starts eating a little even just a tiny bit you should consider this a major improvement and maybe he she's too weak to eat a feed all at once try giving it to him her little by little with time for him her to rest in between if the situation gets critical you can him her take to the vet and have a drip installed to feed her all the nutrients and stuff he she needs and it's not going to be terrible to keep the kitty a bit longer than the others or are you hoping to make sure they are all gone as soon as possible give him her some time  Cat Guinea pig Kitten RuneScape quests Garfield Breastfeeding Atomic Kitten Pet skunk Phoebe Buffay's songs Stomach cancer Poker jargon Dog Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Social rule Chocolate Tick Domestic rabbit Dairy Little Britain Hamster Nutrition Piccolo Junior Saga Sin City Theory of conduct Feral cat Badly Drawn Kitties Vegetarianism Bat 613 mitzvot Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Drill bit Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Doug Organic farming W.I.T.C.H.

cat goes back to pooping on the floor i trained him to go in the litter a while ago but he just started doing it again he isn't too bright i don't know why and everything the internet tells you is wrong so don't copy and paste stuff off the internet just so you know i don't read that stuff and anything that is like paragraphs long please help cats stop using their boxes because something is wrong it could be something as simple as he's picky about how clean or in some cases unclean his box is or the kind of litter you use cats are highly sensitive to smell and touch so if the box is stinky obviously he's not going to want to use it or if the litter is a weird texture or too sandy or too dusty or one of a million other things he could just be going to what he knows and likes beyond those reasons it can be medical usually you'd be dealing with urinating on the floor which in my opinion is much worse or in strange places so if you're noticing anything different increased water intake less intake of dry food diarrhea straining to go multiple trips to the bathroom or anything else out of the ordinary get him to the vet i know how you're feeling in this case because i've had to compromise with one of my cats who just doesn't like the box at all she'll only use it when she absolutely has to and let her use my bath tub it sounds gross but is easy clean up so i figure it's better than cleaning urine out of my carpets obviously that may not work for you so i can suggest toilet training your kitty which can take time but would be pretty cool i think this is the best link i've found with info on toilet training http www karawynn net mishacat toilet html most importantly i know how frustrated you must be with your kitty but give him some time and patience and you should be able to find common ground with him  Hamster Cat Fecal incontinence Toilet Urinary incontinence Guinea pig Shaggy dog story Fancy rat Toilet paper Toilet humour Pet skunk Sin City Milton H.

cat left outside in florida heat i let my orange tiger cat out on the porch as you all know summer in florida is the worst it was only for an hour or two but when i finally heard him crying i saw he was panting so i immediately let him in he got inside and he panted a little more but then he stopped i tried to get a good look at him and i saw that underneath his left eye was shiny with what looked to be water so he was either crying or sweating will he be alright i wet his coat with ice cubes and he hardly moved he hates water but now he's stopped panting should we get him to the vet or was he just uncomfortable lots of water and a trip to the vet i would also recommend against letting him outside no matter what the weather there are many more dangers outside besides the heat indoor cats are generally a lot healthier and live longer than cats that go outdoors good luck and best wishes to you and your cat  Cat Guinea pig Garfield Hyperthermia Sauna Domestic rabbit Diving suit Piccolo Junior Saga Opportunity rover Dog Ice Ren and Stimpy Fancy rat Phoebe Buffay's songs Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ferret One Piece minor characters Toilet humour Pitaten Swimming pool Shaggy dog story Fast bowling Characters in the Smurfs Cruising (maritime) Hamster ThunderCats The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Xiaolin Showdown Water Climate of the United Kingdom Extreme weather Veterans Stadium Jackass: The Movie Thermal power station Luck Okashina Okashi Hiking Ben Johnson (athlete) The Contender (television series) Soldering Terri Schiavo Ice hockey Light-emitting diode Thermoregulation Breastfeeding Carbon dioxide Grandview, U.S.A.

my cat sometimes throws up a clutch of hard food why he is a large tabby cat and fat sometimes he will just throwup a large clutch of hard food like maybe ce every months or so also he has been throwing up his food a lot lately and we havnt switched his foods or anything why is my cat doing this that sounds exactly like what happened to my cat she is overweight too i thought maybe it had to do with hairballs but found out that was not the case if i looked at the puke it had actual pieces of her food in it it wasn't a hairy lump like a hairball a lady i knew told me that cats cat develop allergies to their food and that i should switch up her food i didn't believe her at first i had been feeding my cat purina cat chow her entire life and she'd never had any problems until now i kept feeding her the purina food and kept cleaning up more and more puke one day my cat got very sick and lethargic and threw up every hour for four hours straight finally we took her in to the vet and he told us to change her food i bought some iams food and mixed it in with her old purina food and she picked out all the old purina pieces and left the new iams ones it took a while to get her to eat the new food but once she had made the complete switch to the new food the puking stoped i suggest that you switch the food make sure you mix the new food in with the old food this makes the change easier on the cat brush your cat at least twice a week this keeps the hair from slowing down the digestion process a dog's tick and flea remover brush works well for my cat if the puking keeps up after doing and you should probably go to the vet and check your cat for worms  Cat Garfield Fancy rat Ralston Purina Company Vomiting Dog Guinea pig Hamster Ferret Shaggy dog story Flea RuneScape quests Breastfeeding Nestl__ 2000 Australian Grand Prix Piccolo Junior Saga Kitten The Amber Spyglass Kakapo Pedigree pet food Phoebe Buffay's songs Brown Bear Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Stomach cancer Cat food Dog food Time Out of Mind Milton H.

does head shoulders kill the flea eggs too how oftern can you wash a kitten with it i washed my flea kittens in head shoulders when i let the soap sit on them for minutes it killed the fleas i would like to know if it kills the eggs too and how often i should wash them in it they are only weeks too little for advantage etc thanks for all the responses tho i don't usually use human shampoo on cats as cats tend to be so sensitive to so many things and i don't know what products are safe to use on my cats i doubt that head shoulders kills flea eggs as most flea products do not you can read the product label if it can kill the eggs it will state that as this is a rare attribute and an excellent selling point for the product that can kill the fleas in the eggs as well what you did is drown the fleas the soap prevents their escape and they drown letting the kit sit with all that soap for min was a great plan now get a flea comb and comb the kitten thoroughly to comb those flea eggs out now do not repeat the shampoo anything that can kill fleas can be hard on the body if used too often so use a comb instead once you have combed the kitten then see how the flea situation looks if the kitten has been inside the house you need to treat it's bed and may need to bug bomb the house as well  Shampoo Cat Flea Sento Red Hot Chili Peppers Diseases of the honeybee Feral cat Kitten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dandruff Ranma __ characters Treecat Schistosomiasis Tattoo Hair Rebreather Columbine High School massacre Crab louse Textile manufacturing Ozzie, Slash, and Flea First aid Beetle Manx (cat) Laserdisc StarCraft: Hybrid Dairy EastEnders Kakapo RuneScape quests Guinea pig Swingout Jason Voorhees Drowning John Frusciante Shark Menstrual cup Egg (food) Soap Professional wrestling holds Equine conformation Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Socialization Xenomorph Dog PlayStation 2 Soap opera Procter & Gamble The Apprentice 2 Chicken Ferret Dog training Hamster Domestic violence Spanking Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Minor Harry Potter Beasts Mosquito Hard disk The Amber Spyglass Insect Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Alaga__sia Puma Top-bar hive Milton H.

does anyone know anything about cats with extra toes i have been offered a cat with toes on each foot he's a gorgeous almost orange and black cat with tabby like markings but in a circular pattern the toe thing concerns me though is this mutation linked to any health risks or is it just one of those things the condition is called polydactylism just means many toes in latin of all the various mutations in cats this is one of the most harmless the main health concern would be that you need to pay just a bit more attention to the claws not only can the extra toes be in a location where they aren't worn by regular use but i had one cat with claws that grew out from between two of his toes and one mutant claw that was double headed and hard to trim otherwise trimming cat nails is pretty easy if you aren't familiar with the technique your veterinarian can show you and there are tons of helpful websites with instructions the most important thing to bear in mind is that your goal is to just snip off the very tip of the claw not trim it down to the quick fortunately if you get your cat accustomed to having you examine and handle his paws while he is young trimming nails will be a lot easier as he grows older since all cat owners should check their cats' paws regularly this concern really hardly qualifies as a special health risk those marking you describe are called classic tabby even though they are less common than the fine lined stripes of the mackerel tabby they are gorgeous aren't they i would have no hesitation in adopting this lovely little fellow and would expect many years of quality companionship from him good luck and enjoy your new cat  Cat Tabby cat Cat coat genetics Pet skunk Dog Hamster 2000 Australian Grand Prix Ferret Leopard Turkish Van Domestic rabbit Nail (anatomy) Fast bowling Equine conformation Manx (cat) Professional wrestling holds Floppy disk Volleyball Garfield RuneScape Marching band Guinea pig Wolverine (comics) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma CPU cache Cheetah Skateboarding trick Dog training Unreal Pottery Red Dwarf characters Wood carving English English Claw Anchor Paintball Milton H.

just taken in a feral week old kitten help we have just collected a week old kitten from a shelter we were told that the mother was feral it was had limited human interaction since weeks once home he is eating but is only comfortable being stroked when in his 'bed' once outside there he runs away and hides as soon as we try and approach can any one offer advice do people think he will be able to be socialised how best to gain his trust pick him up any advice would be gratefully received thanks do you think weeks will make a difference do you think weeks will make a difference cats keep growing the entire first year cats are usually referred to as teenagers until they are about years old what you personally have is the age old nature vs nurture question however the fact that the cat claims territory as his own the bed tells me volumes get the cat comfortable being around you and your family and if it appears he is going to behave as with all cats this is within reason usually theirs then you should get claw caps assuming he is neutered which you would need to do if he isn't to control his scratching the fact he is weeks means he can become used to you over time and will use less and less of his instinctive desires to run and chase and hunt find a way to get him to run chase and hunt in your home this is how you will teach the cat that where he lives now is his new home and that it is a good place make this happen and he will not want to leave and will be a very good pet investing a few months now will reap rewards you never thought of later one final thought here if the cat is prone to biting and does so in a very aggresive manner you will want to figure out a way to discourage this behavior sooner rather than later he needs to understand that biting is ok as long as it is not biting a person as with a small child re enforce positive behavior but not with food a neutered cat will easily become overweight after the second year develop good habits not the bad ones and you will do fine  Cat Socialization Dog Dog training Kitten Feral cat Ferret Altruism Domestication Lie Pet skunk Domestic rabbit Culture Breastfeeding Theory of conduct Soul Guinea pig Brown Bear Puma God and gender Garfield Nicomachean Ethics Milton H.

kitten diahorrea help my kitten has diahorrea and is busy doing it everywhere we have kittens litter boxes i dont know what to do i was told not to rub her face in it she isnt a dog so would not understand so i just scold her firmly everytime i see it take her to it make her sniff it and then scold her any ideas for food which might help to constipate her it'd make things easier for cleaning the house stinks completely a mixture of the lemony smelling cleaning solution specially for pets' excretions and of her excretions too help gosh what sad answers judging seems to be a common thing amongst internet users i think some of your comments rather rude though some were helpful if you have a child and they know how to sue a toilet and then after that suddenly they start excreting in every corner of the house you would sit back and watch discipline is a key in education and the western world lacks it i scold gently how is the kitten meant to understand that it is wrong am i meant to smile and say good girl as i have seen so many parents do to their out of control children please do not tell me i am not fit i am perfectly fit for these kittens was only asking something i am not scolding the kitten for diahorrea just for its refusal reluctance to do it in the litter box i have taken her to a vet she has been given the deworming paste so i am guessing it is merely dietary the vet said she is perfectly fine that the meds might cause it so was asking for home remedies gosh i dont rub her face in it i merely say in a more stern voice that she should stop my tone changes because animals do understand tone gosh what do all of you do with your pets children when they do something wrong then all of you have asked what scolding is i'm shocked first try feeding her boiled meat with rice just boil some meat preferably chicken in some water add rice and cook until rice is tender but mixture is still a little sloppy this will help to keep her from dehydrating and settle her stomach as to rubbing her nose in it don't let anyone tell you it won't work it will but be gentle and just touch her nose to it and put her in a litter pan but consider the problem may be she is young enough that with the diarrhea she can't make it to the litter pan by the time she realizes she needs to go if this continues for too long please take her to a vet  Pet skunk Cat Domestic rabbit Fecal incontinence Kitten Guinea pig Ferret Shaggy dog story Hamster Salad Fingers Dog training Fancy rat Garfield Humphrey Bogart Japanese toilet Kashrut Dog Pitaten Housebreaking Jewish cuisine Zhao Yun Social rule Kodocha Singlish Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Milton H.

at what age do you start a kitten on cat food my cat had one kitten three weeks ago and of course is still nursing but i was wondering when i should start introducing cat food into the kittens diet the above answer is exactly correct they need dry food as it cleans the teeth much better does not cause diarrhea so bad i personally never feed wet food i usually start at about weeks with dry warm water just enough to make it moist a bit they want need to use those teeth  Kitten Cat Hamster Domestic rabbit Breastfeeding Pet skunk Ferret Tooth Guinea pig American Alligator Garfield Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Escherichia coli O157:H7 Climate of the United Kingdom Weather lore Dietary fiber Stomach cancer Carnivore Dog Seabird Fancy rat Diarrhea Feral cat Fauna of Australia First aid Survival skills Flea El Ni__o Socialization Cheese Fecal incontinence Dry cleaning Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests Albatross Chocolate Mummy Squirrel Bat Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Protein-energy malnutrition Four humours Bird migration RuneScape quests Dialysis Ham Chinchilla Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests StarCraft: Hybrid Atkins Nutritional Approach Dehydration Coeliac disease Manx (cat) Sauna Shark Carnivorous plant Vegetarianism Folic acid Toast Diving suit Vitamin C Tlingit Coconut crab Water Carbon dioxide Textile manufacturing Certified Nursing Assistant Tyrannosaurus rex Tire Stone Age Mouth ulcer Prostate cancer Livestock Ron and Fez Nepeta Botulism Internet phenomenon Tea Rabbit Giant Panda Oceania ecozone Troll Transmission (medicine) Toilet paper Dairy Red Fox Leaf Chinese food therapy Bottlenose Dolphin Ralston Purina Company Dieting Diseases of the honeybee Cat food Human feces Sucrose Purr 2000 Australian Grand Prix Phoebe Buffay's songs Atomic Kitten

i feed my cat nutrients original and they have even the choice of holistic cat food why will my one cat will eat the dry hulistic and original cat food and for a weeke now my other cat wont eat it and my other cat onl y liked the original so we went last sunday got it back and will only nibble on it now don t understand anyone have any sugestions hi loni some cats are more finicky eaters than others for reasons only known to them like humans they just prefer a flavour or texture more than another additionally some cats particularly are not accepting to changes as they rather have something which is familiar to them a sense of security perhaps we commonly see this with exotic wild cats we rescue where we cannot change their food as they are used to eating one thing for so long it takes a very long time to gradually get them used to a new food what we do to help them make the change is to mix the food they do like to eat with the new food for awhile eventually we gradually reduce the food over time we do not want the cats to eat to get them used to the new food for example  Vegetarianism Taboo food and drink Food preservation Cat Kitten Tofu Healthy eating Bread Livestock Carnivore Genetically modified food Chocolate Food Banana Breastfeeding Guinea pig Tooth enamel Hamster Fish and chips Tooth Pig Buddhist cuisine House Mouse Dieting Eucharist Garfield Red Fox Tomato Rice Socialization Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Feral cat Vegetarianism and religion Domestic rabbit Veganism Ferret Domestication Dog Meat Sausage Organic farming Famine Original sin Fancy rat Minor Harry Potter Beasts Coprophagia Cuisine of the Philippines Metaphysics RuneScape quests Ecology Diarrhea Canary Binge eating disorder Peanut Insulin Buddhism Orca Carrot Biological pest control Cake Dairy Goat Time Out of Mind Folic acid Cannabis cultivation Organic food Curry Cheese Neolithic Revolution Bat Pancake Raw food diet Anorexia nervosa Milk Aliens vs. Predator 2 Education in Germany Nutrition Tiger Korean cuisine Fasting Liver Dave Lister Pet skunk Dim sum Giant Panda The Pet Sounds Sessions Ramen American Alligator Sushi Minestrone Soybean Agriculture Earthworm Japanese cuisine Chronic fatigue syndrome Bengali cuisine Tlingit Felis sapiens Vicia faba

pack of dogs attacks child with kitten kitten killed i was the child still feel guilty horrified advice when i was yrs ago i was out with my dogs in the road we lived in the country in rural north carolina there were no leash laws my neighbor had a new kitten i picked it up was cuddling it the next thing i knew i was surrounded by my dogs other neighborhood dogs the other dogs started biting me i tried to run but they closed in around me and started jumping up i tried covering the kitten and then tried holding her up high which made the dogs act even crazier i was really scared it was awful the dogs got the kitten and i ran i heard the cries of the kitten i was in shock the dogs fell on the kitten with the excitement of wild animals i was so freaked out that my own dogs were part of it it was over in a flash i went over saw the kitten with its intestines pulled out i never told anyone because i was afraid i'd get in trouble for picking up the cat i wanted a cat loved them i'm having trouble getting over this experience i think somehow i could have prevented it or kept trying to get the cat to safety or shouted for help or i shouldn't have picked up a cat that wasn't mine or should have thought that dogs might do something like this at the time i'd had no experience with cats it was a dog neighborhood dogs everywhere i thought my dogs were good dogs who wouldn't hurt anybody plus i couldn't fight the other dogs i couldn't control any of them and i let the kitten go it really is a lingering trauma answering you i've rescued placed dogs since i've been on my own adopted a shelter cat taken in stray cats adopted cats unwanted by neighbors my first cat had her litter of right by my pillow on the floor bed was on floor of attic nook in college i found homes for all of them got one back when mom was run over by a car at age now i feed a group of cats all related near my work i also feed water a group of dogs in the same area most of them related i'm not the main one taking care of them people like to watch when i do this sometimes take photos dogs seem to follow me everywhere i go people remark on this i'm thinking strongly about this 'cuz a few days ago one of the cats was casually following me after i fed them i told him i was going to feed the dogs they usually stay farther away but were closer surprised us jumped out chased my friend cat tried to come to me i picked him up dogs returned cat got away trauma revisited what a horrible traumatic experience for a child i'm so sorry this happened to you i am an animal lover and that memory would be hard for me to deal with too keep in mind that you were a small child and unable to manage several dogs also your dogs were dogs they have prey drive and did what was instinctual for them you did nothing wrong you picked up a kitten to pet it something any child would do and were unaware of the danger that you and the kitten were in you need to forgive yourself i recommend getting some counseling to work through the trauma you experienced by keeping it to yourself it continues to haunt you i also think that doing something to help animals like volunteer at an animal shelter may help you you can help raise kittens and walk dogs since you need to forgive dogs and get over what happened to the kitten by helping other animals you may be able to put the past in the past good luck my thoughts are with you  Shaggy dog story Cat Episodes of Lost (Season 1) RuneScape quests EastEnders Dog Dog training Ferret Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sin City Milton H.

need help from those who have had a cat with ocd my cat has developed an obsessive compulsive disorder and over grooms causing bald spots and bloody scabs she sucks on her skin and pulls out fur she has been on anxiety tablets and these have helped a lot on top it has cleared up perfectly however underneath on her belly and sides she has started up licking and sucking and has caused havoc my question have any of you with cats that have experienced a similar problem has the cat eventually healed and the behavioural problem gone away do you think she needs stronger anxiety tablets until she is all cleared up and her fur grows back i believe her over grooming ocd began when she had a flea infection and even though the fleas are gone have been treated the behavior still remains she is half burmese and i read on the net that oriental breeds can be a bit nutty thanks so much any advice is welcome i am seeing a vet just wanted some advice from cat owners with a similar experience if you haven't already done so it's a good idea to get the vet to test for things such as diet sensitivity and allergies psychogenic or nervous dermatitis is a reaction to stress or recent illness the normal adult cat spends over a third of it's waking day grooming aside from the obvious benefits like ridding themselves of parasites and keeping the coat clean cats also find grooming therapeutic in helping to relieve tension some sensitive cats use grooming as a comforting diversionary activity when faced with some kind of challenge or perceived threat other than when she had a problem with fleas could there be any other source of stress in her life changes of any kind in the home while her wounds are healing they will itch and your cat is responding by grooming the areas and so the vicious cycle continues you may have to consider fitting her with an elizabethan collar to stop her doing this your vet is already prescribing sedatives but the original psychological cause of the problem needs to be identified and treated if she's a particularly sensitive cat you may need to build up her competence levels so that she doesn't revert back to this behaviour should she become stressed again oriental breeds are known for being highly intelligent but they are also more disposed to problems like psychogenic dermatitis and pica consumption of non food items like fabric cables and wool they require a lot of mental stimulation to stop them from becoming bored is your cat an indoor only pet if so it might be a good idea to allow her outside for short periods on a harness this will divert her attention away from grooming and will build up her confidence if you are unable to do this make sure to set aside regular time every day to play and interact with her as this should help divert her attention from grooming the web article below offers further advice on this subject http www bsava com virtualcontent derm ch pdf hope you find a solution good luck  Chronic fatigue syndrome Dog Insomnia Domestic rabbit Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Guinea pig Eczema Clinical depression Coeliac disease Autism Anxiety Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Psoriasis Clomipramine Charles Darwin's illness Baldness Milton H.

my cat is peeing and pooping on the floor since we got a new cat what can i do the cat who is doing this is only yrs old i'm positive she doesn't have a urinary tract infection as this behavior started as soon as we got our new cat months ago my wife has tried rubbing her nose in it and such and it doesn't work she has a terrible attitude and we can't have her continuing doing this at this point we are close to taking her to a shelter but i very much don't want to do that nobody else would want her miserable butt and that would be condemning her to death essentially what adds insult to injury is that she is peeing and pooping on the floor only feet away from her litter box we even bought some plug in that is supposed to release motherly hormones to calm our cats down doesn't seem to work either any suggestions she is marking her territory because she is feeling threatened by the presence of the other cat cats can be jealous like people and they do things to show their discontent get her fixed and that should help if she is already fixed then separate them and gradually introduce them back together she has been queen of the house for a long time and now you brought in a princess to replace her and she is feeling the tensions and pressures and taking it out on her human parents  Urinary incontinence Domestic rabbit Friends Pitaten Breastfeeding Ranma __ characters Shaggy dog story Infantilism Aerial (dance move) Tenchi Muyo!

do cats mourn if so for how long i had cats of them were brothers well last year we had to put one of the brothers down because of lukemia i was wondering if his brother still misses him the way the rest of us do yes cats do mourn just as with people and other animals mourning varies with each individual though animals are more resilient then humans so seeing that is was a year ago he does likely remember and miss him but he's most likely moved on the mourning period of animals can be as short as a day or two to as long as to months since they were littermates it was probably toward the longer end  Jewish eschatology Jade Emperor Jewish bereavement Felix the Cat Chinese calendar Socialization John F.

my cat had kittens weeks ago and they have all opened there eyes except who has a sort of scab over its eyes what should i do usually the mother will lick it and make sure ti's kept clean so watch that mama is doing it if she isnn't put the kitten boo boo close to mama nose so she can smell the scratch and she should take care of it if she doesn't then use a warm not hot cloth and gently wipe the eyes don't force them open right away do it gently and slowly you don't want to pull the delicate flesh around the eyes if neither of these work then get the kitten to a vet also when i had my litters i didn't allow the stronger kittens to take over the best teets so i constantly moved them around so the kittens all got the best milk the best milk comes from the middle to the back of the mother the least comes from the first two nipples so give them a shuffle i've done this through three litters and this gives the runt a great chance at catch up it really works  Guinea pig Kitten Ferret Garfield Joke Breastfeeding Little Britain Pet skunk Aerial (dance move) Poker jargon Dog Happy Tree Friends Delta Goodrem Social rule Fecal incontinence The Ashlee Simpson Show RuneScape quests Domestic rabbit Chinchilla Manx (cat) Pitaten Milton H.

how do you toilet train a kitten i've picked up a stray kitten last night i heard her mewing and she basically followed me because it was late at night and she was so small i figured she'd probably been abandoned she won't even eat solid food yet only milk plus she looked scared and was basically begging passer bys with continuous mewing so i took her in the only problem is it's been about hours now and i don't know where she goes yet i'm sure she must have left a gift or two somewhere by now i wasn't prepared for this so right now i've filled a shoebox with potting soil i'm going to go get some real litter in a couple of hours anyway i've shown her the shoebox but it hasn't been used yet and i don't think she gets it so what's the quickest way to get a kitten to understand the concept of litter box first thank you for caring get some gerber stage chicken baby food and the kitten milk kmr also dry kitten food which you can soak and a little canned food which she can have a teaspoon of times a day also a bag of regular litter not clumping don't use pellets because if you end up finding her another home she may not use regular litter mix baby food with a little kmr and she'll eat remember she's stressed and she's just a baby you can try gently rubbing her hieny with a warm wet piece of cotton and see if that helps make sure she can get into litter box okay here's a great trick put her in litter box gently take one of her little front paws and dig with it just a few times it triggers instinct then leave her alone let her leave the box herself and watch her to make sure you don't miss her first pee then and this is important watch her carefully and when she is nosing around like she needs potty put her in the box and leave her if she doesn't go right away you can do the gentle dig again once make sure she uses the box and you shouldn't have a problem again it's just that first time another good idea is to put a little litterbox in every room so that her tiny bladder always gets relieved in a box it's only temporary and it's better to make it easy for the kitten to do what you want if she starts soiling elsewhere she will do it again this routine has never failed me best of luck  Cat Urinary incontinence Hamster Fecal incontinence Kitten Toilet humour Guinea pig Ron and Fez Pet skunk Shaggy dog story Dog Phoebe Buffay's songs Tea Plastic Fancy rat Housebreaking Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Chicken Kodocha Comanche The Inside Menstrual cup Idli Genericized trademark Kitchen Social rule Humphrey Bogart Dairy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kosher foods Customs and etiquette of Japan Japanese tea ceremony Cannabis cultivation Diaper RuneScape quests Sharon Tate Characters in the Smurfs American Black Bear EastEnders Tofu Halitosis Mattress Tlingit The Amazing Race Carnivorous plant The Ashlee Simpson Show Capercaillie Chocolate Casting Aerial (dance move) Piccolo Junior Saga Elephant Childbirth The Star Wars Holiday Special Ben Johnson (athlete) Hydroponics Vampire Little Britain Joy Division (band) Pottery Magic (illusion) The Marshall Mathers LP Johnny 5 Night (book) Jon Secada Oscilloscope Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Coconut crab Escape from New York Cuisine of the Philippines Joke Japanese cuisine Toilet Spidey Super Stories Oplan Bojinka The Shining (film) Continuation War Cheese Yoko Ono First aid Iditarod Salad Fingers Blood (computer game) Kashrut Pittsburgh Steelers Time Out of Mind Sea-Monkey Escherichia coli O157:H7

how can i help a slowly starving stray cat without taking it home last night on the way home from picking up my brother at work we stopped at walgreen's to buy some milk on the way home as i was waiting in the car i saw a small skinny young grey and white cat it looked like it had not had food and water for a while and had no tags but was domesticated i approched the cat which was about year old and tried to pet him he pulled away at first but then let me pet him i was able to pick him up and wanted to take him home but my mom would not let me keep him and told me to leave it out in the cold parking lot i later learned the next day via store employees that the cat usually hangs around the parking lot looking for food at night i want to help this cat but can't call animal control because they will most likely euthenize him i do't know of anybody who could take it in how can i help the cat get proper nutrition and save it's life without taking it home my grandma bless her has been doing this kind of thing ever since she's been able to coherantly think if you want to help the cat try bringing it food and lots of it it's hard for strays to find food especially in crowded areas and water and if you want to spoil it some milk dont bring it too much milk though thats just a treat if if has no shelter try and find a potentially hidden area to put the food down with a blanket that the cat could snuggle or feel safe with try giving it a few small toys that it could play with when its bored it can be nerve wracking and it could be putting extra expenses in your life but strays need a home too try and put up flyers little old ladies who need some companions love older calm cats my grandma as well as my mother and i carrying on her duty in life lol have fostered homes for cats for a few weeks until someone could come and orient themselves with the cat that they could love pay attention to the cat for awhile doesnt have to be long and then bring a friend or a family member with you so the cat will get used to humans it could cut into your life but you will feel alot better about it after you've done it it's a nice kind thing to do especially when you have my karma hah the shelter is not a good place for older cats they dont give them much adoption time especially when they are feral outside cats and the poor thing will be scared to death it will probably end up with the cat being put to sleep try and put flyers around grocery markets and convience stores or wherever your little old ladies like to hang out even a vet's office is a good place both of my cats are strays and i feel that they are loveable friendly beings getting a stray is potentially better than buying one and many people know this so finding a home shouldnt be too hard from what you've said the cat is rather friendly and that is alot better than trying to find a home for a feral cat good luck  Cat Garfield Socialization Feral cat Dog Kodocha RuneScape quests The Amber Spyglass Guinea pig Shaggy dog story Pet skunk EastEnders Phoebe Buffay's songs Time Out of Mind Ranma __ characters Conker's Bad Fur Day Humphrey Bogart Silent Night, Deadly Night Dog training Sin City Taboo food and drink Breastfeeding Ferret Fiddler on the Roof One Tree Hill (TV series) Kangaroo The Subtle Knife Charmed YuYu Hakusho The Lovely Bones The Family from One End Street Friends Singlish Feral The Contender (television series) Rabies Fancy rat Care Bears Aerial (dance move) Maison Ikkoku Ed, Edd n Eddy Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Mattress Animal euthanasia Rent (musical) Piccolo Junior Saga One Piece minor characters Dairy Atomic Kitten Ocean's Twelve Domestic rabbit The Inside Tag The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Knots Landing Rabbit Franklin (television series) Little Britain Incarnations of Immortality The Fairly OddParents 2000 Australian Grand Prix Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Animal shelter About a Boy Comanche Marilyn Monroe Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Tofu Neighbours Sant Thakar Singh Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Rocko's Modern Life Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dead Like Me Social rule Animal rights The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Domestication Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Lady and the Tramp SpongeBob SquarePants The Simpsons Blood on the Tracks Everwood Supermarket The Pet Sounds Sessions The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The Adventures of Pete & Pete Characters in the Smurfs The Brothers Karamazov Kitten

is it safe to use a perimiter electronic fence on cats i'd like to allow my cats time outside i have done a little checking on petco about the availability of these electronic yard fence systems but i'd like to hear from someone that uses or has tried this with cats well i havent tried it on my pets seeing as i like to compare myself to what they are feeling how would you enjoy getting a shock to the neck whenever you accidentally stick your foot out of your boundries or the foot leg ear drum or any other body part for that matter i wouldnt suggest getting one cats are fragile and very tempermental and it could distance you from your animals you could be accidentally harming your relationship with them they have emotions just like all of us humans do dont forget try getting a pet collar tags and a regular fence if you want your cats to go outside or one of those little seethrough shed looking things that are attached to your house brain fart ugh my cousin had one whatever it was  Dog Cat Horse Garfield Fancy rat PETCO Park John F.

my cat and his sleepieness im worried about my cat he never wants to excersice anymore and he's only years old how can i get him to be more active my first question has he been checked by a vet then is this a sudden change gradual is he an indoor outdoor kitty or strictly indoor make sure it isn't a medical condition first then you can start trying other things it could be he's bored do you play with him and engage him in chasing things try a new toy or bring one out he hasn't used in awhile try taking a ribbon or sturdy string and having him chase it as you wiggle it lift it etc also they usually have pretty frequent sleep awake cycles throughout the day and night so this just might be normal for him since he's not a kitten anymore just make sure he knows he can always get a pet scratch on the ears and love from you and you'll be fine  Cat Sleep Garfield Socialization Girly Phoebe Buffay's songs Catscratch Shaggy dog story Housebreaking Guinea pig Narcolepsy Dog Characters of The Sandman Dream Milton H.

why won't my kitten pee in the litter pan we just found a stray kitten about a week ago i recently caught her peeing on a towel that was on the floor kids she will poop in the litter pan but i don't understand why she won't pee in it she does have an appointment with the vet and i am going to try different litter i believe she is almost months any suggestions your kitten used to have the entire outdoors as its litter pan just give it some time to adjust to the new rules and restrictions trying a new litter as well as getting a second litter pan are excellent ideas confining the kitten to a small room for awhile may help condition it to use the litter pan it may have also just been one isolated case there is also the chance that your kitten has a bladder infection so have your vet check it out  Ferret Guinea pig Pet skunk Fancy rat Cat Domestic rabbit Feral cat Toilet humour Prostate cancer Manx (cat) Garfield Socialization Housebreaking Dog Fire fighting Big Brother UK series 5 Urine Tick Hamster RuneScape quests Menstrual cup Tobacco smoking Education in Japan Daylight saving time Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong House of Leaves She Loves You Cat litter Urination The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Kasparov versus The World StarCraft: Hybrid Smoking ban AIDS Madonna (entertainer) Sailing Marburg virus Carnivorous plant Species Chinchilla Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pan Am Flight 103 Docking Eric Bischoff Equine conformation Chess terminology Albatross National parks of England and Wales Tag Cartridge (firearms) Traumatic brain injury Drag racing Traumatic incident reduction Betting (poker) Lacrosse Ice hockey Poker jargon Sento Penis Gray Wolf Kakapo Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Sharon Tate Dialysis Swimming Treecat Blackjack Paul Reubens Ron and Fez HIV Feral Toxoplasmosis Through the Looking-Glass Japanese toilet First aid Wok Weighing scale Enceladus (moon) San Francisco 49ers 28 Days Later Cheetah Quarantine Timeline of AIDS Labrador Retriever Investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 Ben Johnson (athlete) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy cultural references Eventing Planetary nebula Multiple sclerosis Volleyball Magical objects in Harry Potter Bear History of South Africa in the apartheid era Rabies Thermoregulation Lung cancer

how can i get my cat to stop scenting scenting me or just carrying a cloud around him my cat is scenting me and it smells awful sometimes he just has a cloud around him and sometimes it'll be left behind on what he's laying on he doesn't have anyone to compete with anymore we used to have a cat a female litter mate sister he uses his cheeks mostly the gland right near his mouth and i can always tell when he's scenting rather than just trying to get attention i came home tonight and he just stunk he is neutered so i don't think he's going through a mating thing i hate the smell it's so awful i am starting to bath him every weeks now because it just starts building up and i try to wash and spritz whatever he might make stink and use air freshener what the heck do i do i'm a bit confused you seem to mostly be talking about him rubbing his head on you and other things with his cheeks to mark i have been around cats for decades and yes they mark this way all the time however i have never been able to smell it cats have anal glands located right by their rectums that produce a foul smelling substance your cat may have a problem with them as they can become impacted and abscessed so have your vet check it out he may simply require them to periodically be expressed you said your cat has been neutered but didn't say how long ago if it has been only recently it does take awhile for the tom cat smell to go away so be patient if that is the case spraying is when a cat male or female uses urine to mark their territory cats will back up to objects and walls and then spray urine without squatting there is not too much you can to to prevent this behavior except to try to keep your cat's territory free from what your cat sees as threats or to use pheromones as found in feloway products available from your vet  Animal communication Pet skunk Skunk Menstrual cycle Housebreaking Shaggy dog story House Mouse Kakapo Rabies Guinea pig Anal sex Prostate cancer Japanese toilet Urinary incontinence Dog Traumatic incident reduction American lobster Territory (animal) Fancy rat Honeybee Kitten Olfaction Hemorrhoid Fecal incontinence Trademark Tobacco smoking One Piece minor characters Flatulence Domestic rabbit Halitosis Grammatical gender Fire fighting Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Gender Odor Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington Cheetah Radiation therapy Gender-neutral language Felis sapiens Breastfeeding Prolog Biology and sexual orientation Elephant Pep__ Le Pew Mosquito The Fairly OddParents Taikyoku shogi Shark Feral cat The Critic Garter snake Calvin and Hobbes Gloom (Pok__mon) Equine conformation Manx (cat) Jam (TV series) Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Water Spotted Skunk Shit Natural Selection (computer game) Camp Lazlo Tasmanian Devil Ant Medicine Social rule Garfield Milton H.

why is new kitten so mean i have had my kitten for months now and recently got a new kitten the older kitten is excited and keeps trying to play and lay with the new kitten but the new kitten hisses and swats at him and wont let him near her is there a way to help the new kitten get along with the older new kittens cats are always nervous in new surroundings your older cat's playful ness is probably too much for your new kitty to handle at the moment its already overwhelmed being in a new place give your new kitty time to adjust without being bothered by your older kitty when he gets comfy in his new surroundings slowly let them spend more time together it will take the new guy some getting used to the old guy and if your old cat keeps badgering her and trying to play too rough she won't be able to adjust and will keep being aggrivated by your older cat and will never come to like him give her the time and space to explore without distraction when shes comfy then she'll be ready to socialize with your older cat  Kitten Ferret Cat Socialization Garfield USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) Shadowcat Feral Feral cat Atomic Kitten Every time you masturbate___ God kills a kitten Catgirl Badly Drawn Kitties Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Hello Kitty Cats (musical) Cuteness Manx (cat) Domestic rabbit Abu Dhabi Treecat Guinea pig Marc Antony and Pussyfoot Azumanga Daioh Internet phenomenon Glossary of nautical terms Kitty Kelley Softball 2channel Thermoregulation Purr B3ta Sarah Kerrigan Girly Bast (goddess) RuneScape quests Futurama (TV series - season 4) Care Bears Goatse.cx USS Chicago (CA-136) StarCraft: Hybrid Alger Hiss 2001: A Space Odyssey Lie El Goonish Shive Asiatic Golden Cat Hearts (game) Pet store The Aristocats Abd al-Rahman ibn Sakhr Cat on a Hot Tin Roof Aerial (dance move) Abstraction Feral cat colony OpenBSD Neko the Kitty Time travel Xiaolin Showdown Big Brother UK series 5 Shaggy dog story Siamese (cat) The Sound of Music Chronic fatigue syndrome Windows XP BattleTech technology Phoebe Buffay's songs Tokyo Mew Mew Cat's Eye Nebula Toxoplasmosis Planetary nebula Louis Wain The Beatles bootlegs John Forsythe Lockheed (comics) Ultimate Spider-Man Breastfeeding Stacy Carter Sam and Fuzzy First Battle of the Atlantic Sylvester (Looney Tunes) Charles Darwin's illness USS Turner Joy (DD-951) Bobcat Okashina Okashi Avenue Q Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux Car handling Swingout Curiosity Mappy Rod Stewart Maneki Neko ELO rating system Nepeta Social rule First English Civil War Family Guy Lynx Tesla coil The Death Gate Cycle

my cat hurt her leg yesterday i noticed my cat was limping on her front left leg and it's sort of bent and it's really painful for her my mom refuses to take her to the vet saying she'll heal by herself but i don't believe her she's a little bit better today she's able to walk on it a bit more but she's still limping when it starts hurting her really badly she'll hiss and growl it sort of looks like she twisted or sprained something i hate seeing my cat in pain so is there anything that i can do to help her the reason she isn't taking her to the vet is one she lost her job and two we had another cat that broke her leg and we took her emergency and all they did was x rays and she healed on her own and that was a very expensive trip to the vet i asked for advice how to make my cat feel better not for people to insult my mom so if your just going to say bad things about my mom then don't answer my question please take this seriously i'm sorry to hear that but really the only best option is to bring her to the vet i know it might be costly but hey what goes around comes around to let her heal by itself well it just ain't right your cat really need a doctor and i'll pray for your cat to heal k  Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Social rule The Shining (film) Professional wrestling holds Sydney Riot of 1879 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct Mojave people Phoebe Buffay's songs Kyle Broflovski Characters of Lost Cindy Sheehan Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Little Britain Futurama (TV series - season 5) Kodocha Piccolo Junior Saga The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Equine conformation Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan Avenue Q Satchel Paige Rent (musical) Spanking Pok__mon Live!

my cat wails at night when carrying his toy why my cat is about yrs old and has been doing this for several years now he only does it in the middle of the night and only when he is carrying an old toy this toy is like a sock with the end of it tied i throw it in a corner in the living room and every night he finds it and carries it in his mouth across the room and does this weird wailing while he is carrying it if i wake up and hear him i call out to him and he brings it to me then stops the wailing if i don't hear him he just drops it in the middle of the living room he does this every night without fail he is healthy so i think it is just a behavioral issue i have spoken to my vet about this and she said one of her cats wails too but she has no idea why can anyone tell me why he does this i read some of the answers to a simular posting but it doesn't seem to fit him i need to add that he starts out sleeping with me but then searches for his toy in the middle of the night finds it and wails my cat oreo loves poof balls he does what i call talking to his toy just like when a baby will bring his her favorite toy and babble to you cats are nocturnal so they're up at night roaming and playing your cat is merely talking to his toy or loudly calling out for you to come play or come see what he's doing my other two cats don't do this but oreo does i had a cat a long time ago that went outdoors and max was his name would bring my mom a bug or a bird that he just caught and he would sit out in the driveway looking into the kitchen window where my mom would be holding onto what ever he had caught and he would cry out to her very loudly he was looking for her praise approval so adorable so your cat doesn't have behavioral issues he's just talking this isn't something to be concerned about too bad cats can't do this during the day lol  Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Inside Phoebe Buffay's songs RuneScape quests Avenue Q Garfield Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Columbine High School massacre The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Late Night with Conan O'Brien Miss Saigon Pitaten Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jam (TV series) Pok__mon Live!

does anyone know if the manx cat breed are born to always have the wild characteristics does anyone know if the manx breed are born to always have the wild characteristics i've had my manx for about years it lives indoors and it still bites it's bit ever since it was a kitten i can only pet it on the head or rub its neck and nothing below but if i pet longer than like minute it will turn around and take a chunk of my hand i don't even pet it rough either its light petting yet it still comes and rubs against me like it wants me to pet it and it meows if me and my family call for it and it follows us around but why does it bite us and other people i don't understand i would think if it didn't like being pet it wouldn't rub against me even after it eats and its full already it will rub against us yet then not too long it will bite us what is wrong with it is it bipolar or something i wish i had a normal cat i could pick up and hold aside from that he always hides under the coffee table and when people walk by he pounces out and jumps on our legs and claws and bites us too i always have to throw something out into the middle of the floor so it goes for that thing first before my leg so i can walk by without a mark this doesn't have anything to do with what type of breed she is manxes are usually a gentle breed most don't come from the island of man no more but have been purebred well as far as that applies to a breed that needs to be outcrossed constantly for generations for health and good character this sounds more like a problem with her upbringing the biting probably wasn't handled appropriately when she was a kitten a kitten should immediately be left alone and ignored when it bites so it learns biting means play or cuddletime is over by now it's likely just become part of her behavioral pattern and i doubt it could be changed at this stage for her it might not even be linked with aggression at all it might just be play she just never learnt where the boundaries are in that the headrubbing means she's leaving a scentmark on you to state to the world that you're part of her domain so yes she does accept and like you but it sounds like for her that's no reason not to nip at you even when treated completely by the book some cats still won't like being picked up in adulthood cats have strong personalities and can't be forced to like anything they can be trained to great extend though a cat that was picked up and cuddled a lot as a kitten from birth on is more likely to find this pleasant and comforting in adulthood too if you want to see if anything could be done even at this age you could contact a behavioral therapist for your cat good luck with her  Manx (cat) Dog Domestic rabbit Dog training Garfield Guinea pig Kitten Social rule Hamster Fancy rat Milton H.

why do cats knead we recently put out a new pillow and one of my cats obsessively kneads on it some times he will actually lay down but most of the time he just sits there and kneads for a long time cats knead because its a comfort thing for them they knead their mothers tummy while suckling to help milk flow so even through adulthood they see it as a comfort thing and it reminds them of there mothers they tend to do it most before lying down on a person or something else soft it can be annoying and can hurt a tiny bit if the cats padding on you but dont discourage it after all how would you feel if every time you tried to get comfortable remembered your mom or displayed a comforting habit even if the kitty doesnt lie down and just kneads for a while it probably just needs some comforting or a reminder of its days as a little kitten with its mom my cat sometimes kneads on a pillow and cries i guess hes feeling lonely and needs some comfort so when he does this i pick him up and cuddle him till he falls asleep and for as long as i can afterwards when a cat kneads on a person it means they are comfortable with that person and loves them  Breastfeeding Cat Atomic Kitten Little Britain Phoebe Buffay's songs Care Bears Garfield Kitten Strap-on dildo Ranma __ characters Kim Possible Jam (TV series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fruits Basket Lie Mattress Maison Ikkoku The Shining (film) Upholstery W.I.T.C.H.

my month old cat that we just got days ago still hasnt eaten im worried she wont eat right when we got her we took her to the vet he gave us medicine for her eyes and for her worms we gave her food but she hasnt eaten it we mixed dry food and wet food oh yeah and she is sneazing and coughing what should i do she most likely has an upper respiratory infection if she is sneezing and that can make them decide to eat also if she is still only months old she may not be ready for dry food she needs canned only and kitty chow for sure also at that age you can still give her kitten suppliment milk from the pet store which is packed full of vitamins for her get some quickly into her and to get her to start eating the best thing out there is to go get some gerber or heinz baby meat do not get beef or veal since that is too harsh on kitty's tummy at that age but chicken and turkey are fine get a very good quality kitty soft food that is much better for a cat than dry is anyway and spread some of the baby meat on the top and it will devour it if the vet didn't put it on antibiotics for it's cold then i would call them back and see if they think the kitten is gettng worse if you pinch the fur at the back of the neck kind of tight and then release it quickly and it doesn't immediately lay back down but sort of sticks together then the kitten is getting dehydrated from lack of moisture get some kitten milk and moist food into it as quickly as possible if the kitten still won't eat that combination then there is definitely something wrong with it and it needs medical attention since i've used that combination on lots of kittens and sick adult cats and it works great good luck  Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Cat Kitten Garfield Common cold Fancy rat Food preservation MRE Breastfeeding Dog Taboo food and drink Chicken Hamster Livestock Chocolate Chili con carne Tofu Fecal incontinence Comanche RuneScape quests Milk Urinary incontinence Veganism Pet skunk Dairy Tlingit Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Food Breakfast Diarrhea Pizza Pneumonia Food storage Atomic Kitten Cuisine of the Philippines Characters in the Smurfs Garlic Soup Ferret Tea Chinchilla Cuisine of Denmark Cheese Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Hamburger Gray Wolf 1957 World Series Vitamin C Russian cuisine Snake Folic acid Escherichia coli O157:H7 Badly Drawn Kitties Domesticated turkey Ramen Cha chaan teng Coffee Cuisine of Malaysia Phoebe Buffay's songs Rocko's Modern Life Tuberculosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Domestic goat Toilet humour Poker jargon Sin City Korean cuisine Chicken soup Dog food Insulin Conjunctivitis Cuisine of Brazil Kodocha Genericized trademark Asthma Anemia Curry Group A streptococcal infection Little Britain Carbon dioxide Basic English Chronic fatigue syndrome Dumpling Meat analogue Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Knife Jewish cuisine Hemp Bengali cuisine

how do i get my obese cat to lose weight i have cats my oldest is obese the other are all right in weight if i put my oldest on a diet how can i prevent my other from losing weight i don't know how you feed your cats but cats are obligate carnavoirs and after they are adult they must be fed meals a day with fasting inbetween for their health they intestinal tracts are short and it is better for them if they go without food for to hours inbetween their meals if your cat was in the wild it would be doing that also your cat would be getting a lot more exercise if it was in the wild so be sure that you are giving it at least good quality play periods a day this can be done with a toy on a string or a ball you roll and they chase or you can invent games we play indoor pingpong and badminton so that ours can chase the balls and the birdies we also have several home made toys on strings that we purposely make them chase up and down their condo's the key in these exercises is to play until the cat gets tired and stops first and they will another good game is to get one of those laser lights but be sure you do not shine it in their eyes or they will go blind anyway if you are feeding your cat properly you will find that it tells you one the can of food how much they need for their weight per day per meal if you get your kittys good exercise and keep their food intake correct the ones that are skinny will gain and eat what they need because the exercise will perk their appetite and the ones that are fat can't eat more than you put out for them at a feeding and the exercise will help them lose you can feed them all in different corners of the room and stay there until they are finished or in different rooms if you train them that they will get food for only hour down they will learn that if they want to eat they had best do so all day munching for a cat is not healthy for them if that is what they are currently doing you will have to break them of that habit to do so if they are adults put the food down times a day and leave it down for hours and pick it up for hours for the st week then each week after that pick it up hour earlier until it is only down for hour you can actually get them to eat it all in minutes if you work at it and that is what they should be doing the problem now is that they are allowed to have it all the time most likely and so they have learned to nibble you will have to retrain them and it is very easy if you keep patient and consistent i guarantee they will get the message very quickly cats are actually easier to train than dogs i know since i train all of mind to do everything good luck  Obesity Cat Atkins Nutritional Approach Dieting Hamster Diabetes mellitus Domestic rabbit Fancy rat Breastfeeding Insulin Super Size Me Nutrition Hypoglycemia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dog training Anorexia nervosa Garfield Folic acid Guinea pig Ferret Badminton Low-carbohydrate diet Dietary fiber Coeliac disease Raw food diet Adjustable gastric band Gastroparesis Fasting Bread Fecal incontinence Social rule Tag Little Britain Hamburger Vegetarianism Livestock Urinary incontinence Swimming Milk Tocopherol Poker jargon Veganism Volleyball Piccolo Junior Saga Comanche Terri Schiavo Chocolate Tenshinhan Weight loss Hyperglycemia Tooth Prostate cancer Fugu Paintball Shaggy dog story Fast bowling McDonald's Bodybuilding 613 mitzvot Giant Panda Cleveland Browns 1957 World Series Foodborne illness Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Pet skunk Cirrhosis Gastric bypass surgery The Amazing Race Coronary heart disease Dialysis Sea-Monkey Fast food Vitamin Obedience training MapleStory Game show Babe Ruth New York Giants Exercise Clinical depression Brown Bear Marathon (sport) Softball Egg (food) Healthy eating Albatross Sleep Flatulence Glycogen storage disease type I Conker's Bad Fur Day

about a cat my faamily found a cat outside in our backyard who was very skinny so we took her to the vet and and had her checked and stuff or whatever they do and she was fine so we kept her as a pet about to weeks she seemed to be getting a large belly and her nipples were swelling so we knew she was pregnent a while later it seemed like the day she was gonna have the kittens cuz she was hiding and stuff she was having labor pains i guess and then she just died i have no idea how this happened two days later we buried her and im wondering why the cat died and if it was possible to save the babies when the mom died many times animals have complications in labor just like people it is not always easy to tell because they can act like everythings normal when it's not if she had complications that were serious enough to kill her then usually there is not enough oxygen being delivered to the babies and they are either born dead or severely brain damaged she would have had to be at the vet's office as she died for the babies to have any chance and even then it's usually too late i am so sorry for your loss  Pet skunk Ferret Breech birth Cat Rabies Jon Secada Fancy rat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Traumatic brain injury Phoebe Buffay's songs Obstetrics Childbirth Premature birth Coma Feral cat The Marshall Mathers LP Radiation therapy Socialization Toxoplasmosis Stroke Breastfeeding Guinea pig Drowning Garfield Pregnancy Microchip implant (animal) RuneScape quests Blood (computer game) AFI 100 Years series Intact dilation and extraction Kim Possible Diabetic retinopathy First aid KaBlam!

my cat is xtremely lazy he sleeps all day long what action should i take to change this habit cats spend a great deal of their time sleeping the average cat sleeps for hours a day the exact number can change according to the cat's age and personality cats that spend the day alone at home tend to sleep throughout the day newborn kittens spend most of their time sleeping in fact this is nature's way to make sure that the kittens do not wander out of the nest or make noise that might attract predators while the mother cat is away as the weeks pass the kittens' sleeping hours gradually change to match those of the adults  Kitten Cat Feral cat Guinea pig Ferret Capercaillie Socialization Treecat Garfield Seabird Flea Thermoregulation Puma Kakapo Louis Wain Garfield and Friends Red Squirrel Daylight saving time Purr Kangaroo Bast (goddess) Ranma __ characters Hamster Infant Sleep Albatross Felis sapiens Bird migration Diazepam Manx (cat) Housebreaking Breastfeeding Dilbert El Goonish Shive Urinary incontinence Human height Giraffe Bat Kender Hikikomori Childbirth Dream Japanese Bobtail (cat) Feral StarCraft: Hybrid Twin Siesta Animal communication Softball Human Sleep debt Narcolepsy Ron Killings Every time you masturbate___ God kills a kitten Sleeping Murder Vampire Big Brother UK series 5 Clouded Leopard Girly Soap opera Whale Lion Koala Turkish Van Friends Hypoglycemia Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Feral cat colony Haibane Renmei Chuck Jones Grammatical aspect RuneScape gods Fruits Basket Tarantula Hearing impairment Samurai Pizza Cats Nile crocodile Asiatic Golden Cat Fitz Hugh Ludlow Apollo 8 Labour economics Azumanga Daioh Grief Dog Computed tomography The Cat in the Hat Evil reptilian kitten-eater from another planet House Mouse Surveillance STS-61 Cuteness Natural Selection (computer game) Time Paracetamol Polyphasic sleep Dean Koontz Elvis Presley Badly Drawn Kitties Pok__mon Abilities

how do i talk my parents into getting me a cat you have left a lot of details out for one how old are you and how do your parents feel about a cat when you adopt a cat it should be for a 'forever' home if you are a teenager you will probably be thinking of leaving home for whatever reason in four or five years while your cat will still have many good years to live if you go to college you will not be able to take your cat with you so your parents will need to want to take care of it if they simply take it to a shelter it will be to old to get another home and will be destroyed there is a financial cost involved it is unlikely that you would be expected to shoulder the cost more like help with the care and feeding etc so let's assume there is a positive response to what i have posed your parents will care for the cat after you leave home and they will handle the costs provided you take part in the care of the cat you then need to show you are responsible often the easiest is to care for a neighbor's dog as they need to be walked that shows you can take responsibility you might be able to volunteer some time at a shelter showing further your commitment to animals then try and find out from friends what is involved in having a cat around the house you need your parents to want you to have a cat not just the other way around a cat is a life and deserves a good home not just a home on a want yes you ask but you also show them you understand what having a cat is all about  Animal shelter Garfield About a Boy Adoption Polyamory Animal rights Pitaten Domestic rabbit Hamster Theory of conduct Feral cat Laura Schlessinger Care Bears Abortion debate Animal communication Organic farming Insurance Microchip implant (animal) Infantilism People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Team Rocket Cat Extreme Programming Abstraction Dog training Dog Social rule Day care American Red Cross Anorexia nervosa Zoophilia Luck Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Kodocha RuneScape quests The Catcher in the Rye Philip J.

my kitten has no whiskers i have very active weeks old kittens i got them when they were weeks old and they were very sick diahreea vomiting etc for the first few weeks i had them it took about weeks and several medicines later for them to stat feeling better last thursday i came home from being away for a few days for work and noticed that my one kitten the smaller of the two had almost no whiskers the other kitten the bigger one has all of her whiskers i notice as the whiskers start growing out that the ends are bending and then breaking off the two kittens play very rough and i wasn't sure if i should be worried about the missing whiskers sick again or if it could be a result of their roughhousing thanks for taking the time to read this your kitten could have a rex gene it could be diet rough play or even health related there are a lot of posibilities that a vet could eliminate for you with a simple checkup a rex gene can give the kitten kinky wavy fur and kinked whiskers that are often very brittle  Cat Manx (cat) Ferret Kitten Prostate cancer Atomic Kitten Garfield Breastfeeding Pet skunk Fancy rat Socialization Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Domestic rabbit Cat coat genetics Tyrannosaurus rex T.

how long is a cat's lifespan i let my cat out of the house in the morning and then let her in a few hours later does that decrease her lifespan she's three years old between to years is average given that the cat is healthy however that is just average and many cats live to over years of age if you let your cat outside it doesn't decrease her lifespan unless she caught a disease such as fiv which is only transmitted through deep bites from infected cats the only reason outside cats have a smaller lifespan is due to so many dangers killing them off such as cars dogs and diseases that don't have vaccines my mom has a cat that has been outside her whole life and is now so don't worry about it but keeping a cat inside is safer  Life expectancy Rabies Feline immunodeficiency virus Toxoplasmosis Sickle-cell disease Herpes simplex virus Feral cat Pet skunk Feline leukemia virus Domestic rabbit Vaccine Ferret Heartworm Fancy rat Mathematical modelling in epidemiology Tick Vaccination Sexually-transmitted infection Diabetes mellitus AIDS Shaggy dog story Duesberg hypothesis Influenza DNA repair Livestock Breastfeeding Smallpox Foot-and-mouth disease Infectious disease HIV vaccine Rocky Mountain spotted fever Animal testing Taboo food and drink Gray Wolf Lion Chagas disease Manx (cat) Prostate cancer Pneumonia Canine parvovirus Measles RuneScape quests Doomsday argument The Fairly OddParents Louis Pasteur Tuberculosis Dairy Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Hamster West Nile virus Parvovirus B19 Cirrhosis Senescence Malaria Quarantine Foodborne illness Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Insulin Disease American Alligator Dog Immortality Jam (TV series) Epidemic typhus The Secret of NIMH Phantom cat Safe sex Chickenpox Cystic fibrosis Life extension MMR vaccine Hepatitis Socialization Colorectal cancer Population history of American indigenous peoples Lyme disease Cytomegalovirus Hookworm Pekingese Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Decompression sickness Yellow fever Tooth enamel HIV Bioterrorism Schr__dinger's cat H5N1 Azumanga Daioh DDT Lassa fever Strap-on dildo Prostitution Swimming Feline Panleukopenia Common cold Escherichia coli O157:H7 Dieting Ebola

what might cause my cat's stool to contain blood one of my cats has had diarrhea for a few days i took him to the vet today and they could find nothing wrong although he did not have enough stool for them to take a sample his appetite and energy level are normal he has been on the same food for two years and my other cats are eating out of the same bag of food and having no problems the vet has given me some medication to treat the diarrhea symptoms tonight however i noticed blood in his stool this was the first time i had noticed blood it was bright red and there wasn't very much i am just wondering what might be causing the diarrhea and blood in his stool seeing as he appears to be otherwise healthy by the way i have a vet appointment tomorrow morning for a different cat to get vaccinations and i am going to bring the ill cat back along with a stool sample to get checked again bloody stool can be caused by intestinal parasites treated with dewormers infection treated with antibiotics intestinal ailments like irritable bowel syndrome treated with steroids and anti inflammatories a foreign body in the intestinal tract like string or other things kitties have a tendancy to ingest or mega colon mega colon happens in older cats and is treated with cefulac syrup and cisapride which are oral medications as you can see the causes for blood in the stool are all treatable so don't you panic your veterinarian will perform a fecal testing with a stool sample the feces will be studied under a microscope to identify any intestinal parasites or abnormal bacteria if the fecal testing is clear your veterinarian may want to perform blood work and an x ray to see if there is anything relevant that can be seen that is causing the bloody stool the condition will be treated accordingly i hope this helps and best of luck  Crohn's disease Fecal incontinence Cancer Escherichia coli O157:H7 Ulcerative colitis Coeliac disease Colorectal cancer Irritable bowel syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chronic fatigue syndrome Ascariasis Human feces Cirrhosis Guinea pig Schistosomiasis Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Vomiting Feces Pet skunk Tuberculosis Urinary incontinence Nutrition Hypoglycemia Entamoeba histolytica Prostate cancer Folic acid Insulin Medicine Fancy rat Clostridium difficile Acne Botulism Constipation Dietary fiber Multiple sclerosis Dysentery Diabetes mellitus Sickle-cell disease Ebola Gastroparesis Psoriasis Escherichia coli Flatulence Group A streptococcal infection Ovarian cancer Anemia Anthrax Clinical depression Gastroesophageal reflux disease Food allergy Allergy Cystic fibrosis Asthma Diseases of the honeybee Abscess First aid Domestic rabbit Aspartame Rotavirus Ferret Rocky Mountain spotted fever Laxative Common cold Obesity Hirschsprung's disease Lactose intolerance Malaria Cytomegalovirus Halitosis Horse colic Vitamin C Endometriosis Trichinosis Autoimmune diseases Chagas disease Legionellosis Fecal occult blood Diverticulosis Coprophagia Whipworm Stroke Hepatitis Diverticulitis HIV test Multiple chemical sensitivity Glucocorticoid

rare calico cats i just want to know why are male calico cats rare i have a female but a lot of people tell me the boys are rare and i should find one for breeding and make i don't want to breed i just want to have another friend i am just curious to know why they are rare though it is true that male calicos are rare however breeding them isn't going to make you money unless you have baby males which is rare so that is a waste of your time and effort calicos are predominately female this is a result of the way that the feline genetic code accounts for the orange and black colors the gene for fur color appears on the x chromosome therefore calicos need two x chromosomes which usually gives them a set of xx this should result in a female cat the y chromosome does not contain any coding for fur color therefore since male cats are xy and not xx calico cats are very rarely males however this is not always the case cells do not always divide correctly so sometimes instead of an xx or xy sex chromosome pairing the kitten ends up with three chromosomes for instance such a kitten may have xxy if the two x chromosomes contain codes for different colors then it is possible to end up with a male calico this is very rare as it requires that the correct colors of cats mate as well as that there is an error in the formation of the cat embryo calico cats are generally considered to be lucky throughout several different cultures male calicos are so rare and almost always sterile it is impossible to breed calicos with each other however females can be bred by mating orange and black cats if an orange male is bred with a black female for example there is a good chance that any female kittens will be calico while you may end up with a calico male however there is not currently any way known to purposefully breed male calico cats  Cat Tortoiseshell cat Cat coat genetics Intersexuality X chromosome Y chromosome Chromosome Liger Twin Platypus Meiosis Cheetah Mitosis Eye color Gender role Sex Panthera hybrid Plant breeding DNA Color blindness Puma Cell (biology) Sexual differentiation Gene Sex assignment House Mouse Barr body Parthenogenesis Genetic disorder Chimera (genetics) Abortion debate Genetics Reproduction Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Sex-determination system Domestic rabbit Androgen insensitivity syndrome Turkish Van Lion Mutation Congenital disorder DNA repair Cephalic disorder Spider Turner syndrome Intersex surgery Hirschsprung's disease Incest Hybrid Chimpanzee Genome Project Color Sexual identity Cancer Mixed-breed dog Genetic linkage Border Collie Feral cat Bengal cat Dragons (Pern) Eugenics History of intersex surgery Hardy-Weinberg principle Flowering plant Japanese Bobtail (cat) Genetic algorithm Siamese (cat) Gamete Black panther Morphogenesis Kitten Francis Crick Non-human animal sexuality Gender identity Maine Coon Wheat Cats (musical) Tigon Recessive gene Sexual selection Human genome Biology and sexual orientation Haemophilia Phoebe Buffay's songs Evolution Maneki Neko Sexual dimorphism Cytogenetics Genetic recombination Eusociality SRY Debugging Jurassic Park

my cat occasionally gets soft stools this always ends up being only a symptom of a respiratory problem i don't understand the connection between the two but i'm glad i get a good heads up before she becomes distressed or gets a secondary infection the vet gives her a couple of shots for congestion and she is right as rain the next day it's either allergies or a virus he says i can expect her to go through this every or months he says she's looking better than she ever has she had been sick with parasites and uri's as a kitten i keep a savings for her frequent flyer vet visits vet always does a fecal and it's always negative i don't understand the connection between soft stools and respiratory problems it's funny you should ask about a prescription diet today he asked me what she was eating and i told him hill's prescription diet w d high fiber for her soft stool problem he thought that was good sometimes i think her problem is a virus she has been tested and is negative she is strictly an indoor cat most of the time she has solid stools once in a while she has a soft stool then the next day the solid stools resume but when she has three or four days of half solid half soft stools i know something is going on anyone know the connection between respiratory problem and soft stools i actually can never tell she is having a respiratory problem he hears the congestion in her chest the connection may be stress when a cat becomes stressed it can affect his or her gastrointestinal system if your cat responds well to treatment for her illness and the vet has run fecals that have come back negative you probably don't have anything to worry about as far as the soft stool is concerned at least i do agree that you should have your cat on heartworm prevention if she is not already it's been discovered that cats do get heartworms more frequently than we thought they did in the past in infected cats the lungs are often greatly affected ask your vet about feline revolution not only will it help prevent heartworms but it controls fleas too  Heartworm Fecal incontinence Pneumonia Common cold Asthma Medicine Domestic rabbit Chronic fatigue syndrome Cat Cancer Stomach cancer Coeliac disease Colorectal cancer Fancy rat Diarrhea Urinary incontinence Entamoeba histolytica Multiple sclerosis Prostate cancer Ascariasis Guinea pig Cystic fibrosis Clinical depression Poliomyelitis H5N1 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Anopheles Pet skunk Dog Ebola Acute respiratory distress syndrome Tuberculosis Psoriasis Lung cancer Hay fever Myasthenia gravis Breastfeeding Herpes simplex virus Duchenne muscular dystrophy AIDS Cytomegalovirus Cephalic disorder Trichinosis Cirrhosis Virus Influenza Botulism HIV test Henipavirus Lassa fever Sleep apnea Hypoglycemia Escherichia coli O157:H7 Ferret Childbirth Radiation poisoning Panic attack Upper respiratory tract infection Charles Darwin's illness Tobacco smoking Rabies Decompression sickness Insomnia Feces Reflexology Traumatic brain injury Anorexia nervosa Schizophrenia Legionellosis Tocopherol HIV vaccine Norwalk virus group Avian influenza Anal fissure Chemotherapy Glycogen storage disease type I Group A streptococcal infection Anemia Rheumatoid arthritis Adjustable gastric band Dietary fiber Gastroenteritis Marburg virus Feral cat Premature birth Coprophagia Acromegaly First aid Adenoviridae Chagas disease

introducing a new cat hubby and i have adopted a new cat freijha she is from the shelter today we already have a cat oni oni is yr mos and bigger so that is good but they are both girls oni is furious with me and hisses at me when she sees me i think because i was holding the cat when we let them sniff each other there was a lot of hissing and growling but no violence she did swipe at me though later when i came to try and calm her down given that freijha is younger and smaller i hoped that this would work better freijha is a well socialized cat oni has not been with other cats in a year presently oni will not leave her window ledge and we have put freijha in a safe room but she is crying i have such a hard time ignoring it anyone have an idea as to how long this might take for them to acclimate or might they never hi holly how long have you had freijha for how long did you leave it before introducing them if you left it less than one day and night you'll need to go back to square one i'm afraid it sounds to me like you've already read up on how to introduce a new cat seeing as you used the term 'safe room' if you did introduce them on the very first day keep freijha in her room for one whole day and night obviously you can go in and see her lots and if necessary let oni outside or put her in the room and let freijha stretch her legs around the house for half an hour or so the most important thing to keep things running smoothly is to make sure that oni doesn't feel inconvenienced or pushed out you must reassure her that your home is still all hers give her double the fuss you would normally give keep them separate when you are out of the house or asleep if you left it a good few days before introducing them you can probably safely allow them to be together whilst observing if a lot of hissing growling posturing or any violence occurs separate them again for one whole night before re introducing if you introduced them on the very first day keep them apart for a day or two as mentioned above as long as oni is not hissing at you or the door to the room where freijha is being kept you will be ok to proceed if possible i'd advise to close off lots of rooms and just leave freijha's room door open and the living room this way you can keep an eye on them and know where they are i did this for about a week when i introduced my kitten to my cat how long it will take is difficult to say in some cases it could be days in most cases it's about a month in some cases it's a few months they may be best friends or they may just peacefully co exist but usually cats do settle down and learn to live in the same house one way or another the best advice i can give you is to be patient and not to worry if things are moving slowly oni will need lots of love and reassurance over the next few months if after weeks there is still hissing every time they meet and you are still separating them a lot i'd advise you to take the plunge and allow them both to be together we kept our kitten separate from our year old cat for about weeks with supervised meetings but we found that every single time we let the kitten out our cat would jump on her so we decided to bite the bullet and just let the kitten out all day whilst we were in the house after a couple of hours they both got tired and went to sleep in the same room it's been about weeks since we got her and they don't groom each other or sleep together yet they playfight which sometimes gets a bit rough but there is no hissing anymore just take things slowly give lots of love to oni and keep them separate when you cannot observe give it about a month and things should settle down congratulations on your new kitty xx emmie p s have freijha and oni both been spayed if not you'll need to get that sorted soon or everything i've said will be meaningless as they will fight lol  Cat Social rule Sin City Garfield The Amber Spyglass Pitaten Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Jam (TV series) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Shaggy dog story Sleeping Murder The Shining (film) Piccolo Junior Saga EastEnders Dog training RuneScape quests The Star Wars Holiday Special Guinea pig Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ferret Cliff Richard Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Swingout Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Friends Fire fighting Avenue Q Sleep She Loves You Rent (musical) Atomic Kitten Characters in the Smurfs DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX K' The Catcher in the Rye Kodocha The Inside Badly Drawn Kitties Little Britain Weight training The Contender (television series) Poker jargon Time Out of Mind Milton H.

fixing ur cat is it better to fix or castrate ur cat what is the right way to take care of a cat after the operation what should i do please help it's good to spay or neuter if you do not want the female cat to have an unwanted litter if you have a male cat neutering will significantly cut down on fighting roaming spraying urine to mark things and of course will keep him from impregnating strays the operations are pretty routine although for the female cat spaying requires shaving the stomach and a surgical incision she will need a little more recovery time and a good place to rest for a day or two and not going outside she will have stitches that might swell a little but it will resolve itself the operation for the male is simpler and they recover quicker it's also a little cheaper just make sure the cat is not bathed until his incisions heal  Cat Castration Sterilization (surgical procedure) Domestic rabbit Kitten Pet skunk Ferret Guinea pig Circumcision Pit bull Caesarean section Prolog Hernia Intraocular lens Urinary incontinence Cholecystectomy Cat litter Carpal tunnel syndrome Fancy rat Adjustable gastric band Transsexuality Obstetrics Hamster Brian Griffin Cornea transplant House Mouse Hash table Marathon (sport) Diabetes mellitus Socialization Liger Manx (cat) Mummy Penis Animal shelter Embalming Prostate cancer Grammatical gender Gender-neutral language Laparotomy Testicle Spanish pronouns Japanese toilet USS Sea Cat (SS-399) Cancer Skin graft Violin Animal euthanasia Weight training Cytomegalovirus Stroke Body piercing European Rabbit Endometriosis Colorectal cancer Gender Computed tomography Spider Appendicectomy Abortion Certified Nursing Assistant Chinchilla Gender identity Intersex surgery Phimosis American lobster Gastroesophageal reflux disease Microeconomics Space Shuttle program Hyperthermia Chicken Red Squirrel Tom and Jerry (MGM) Shrek 2 Kodocha Autopsy Malignant melanoma Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Bruise Animal communication Microchip implant (animal) Brewery Andr__s Galarraga Plastic Appendicitis Great Dane Rail tracks James Augustus Grant Body modification Polish language Felix the Cat Paragliding RuneScape economy First aid History of male circumcision The Price Is Right

how do i introduce my new pup to my cat we just bought a month old cockapoo and she will be picked up two weeks from now has to get fixed and has one shot to go this gives us time to prepare my cat is a yr old orange tabby who is super spoiled he spends more time in my room than in my brother's and my parent's so we have decided to not let the dog come into my room since it is kinda the cat's room the only thing is i don't know how to introduce them my cat is very friendly he is just really picky when it comes to picking friends and is an indoor outdoor cat who mostly hangs w cats so i don't know how he will first react someone told me to have them greet outside and the dog should be in his crate so that the cat will get first sniff someone else said that i should not be carrying or be petting the pup when my cat is around the first two days so he doesn't get too jelous and seek revenge and to not force their meeting what worries me is the size of the pup compared to the size of my kitty kitty has claws p i've done this with a german shepherd pup and my cat the cat was very freaked out to begin with but they are curious by nature and will want to see what the new addition to the family is doing my cat followed the puppy around but she was sneaky about it the puppy was afraid of the cat to begin with but soon they were used to each other i wouldn't worry about the cat having claws if the pup gets out of line the cat will put her in her place quickly i think i would have preferred that my cat had claws when doing this i think the idea of letting the cat see and sniff the pup while she's still in a carrier is a good idea it will make the cat feel more secure good luck  Cat Garfield Dog training Dog Housebreaking Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Care Bears Shaggy dog story Ron Weasley Guinea pig Hamster Friends Kodocha The Catcher in the Rye The Smoking Room Our Gang Mixed-breed dog Ben Johnson (athlete) Domestic rabbit RuneScape quests USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) Humphrey Bogart 101 Dalmatians: The Series Social rule Ed, Edd n Eddy One Tree Hill (TV series) Johnny 5 Felix the Cat The Contender (television series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Socialization Jam (TV series) Galaxy Angel The Fairly OddParents StarCraft: Uprising Pet skunk Ren and Stimpy Badly Drawn Kitties Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Reservoir Dogs Vegeta Sin City Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Piccolo Junior Saga Great Teacher Onizuka Knots Landing Elvis Presley Steven Wright Lady and the Tramp The Adventures of Pete & Pete Trailer Park Boys Kim Possible Okashina Okashi Serenity (Firefly episode) EastEnders The Critic The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Ultimate Spider-Man Eddie Guerrero The Death Gate Cycle Spidey Super Stories Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) One Piece minor characters The Inside Taikyoku shogi Smallville (Season 4) Little Britain Characters in the Smurfs Nintendo Nintendogs Tom Goes to the Mayor Beethoven (film) Mark Calaway Taxi Driver The Family from One End Street Maison Ikkoku Oh My Goddess!

how can i stop my cat from freaking out each time i try to give him a bath it takes me and my husband forever to wash our cat he keeps trying to jump around and his claws are vicious we started using scotch tape to tape up his paws but they just fall off when we get him in the water any suggestions i copy pasted how to bathe a cat everyone knows that cats hate getting wet cats generally keep themselves clean and therefore should not be bathed any more often than is absolutely necessary but they sometimes get especially dirty get bombarded by fleas or ticks or get into substances that are toxic or otherwise harmful on such occasions it is a good idea to bathe your cat here's how to keep your feline fresh and lovely as painlessly as possible steps evaluate if your cat really needs a bath there may be other ways such as brushing the cat combing or even just rubbing down with a cloth trim all nails before even attempting to wash a cat it will reduce scratching put a rubber mat in the tub or use a towel fill the tub no more than inches high depends on the size of the cat or kitten you are washing with warm water have shampoo and a small wash cloth ready you also might want to have a helper one to hold the cat one to wash have two towels that you will dry your cat with ready as well comb the fur thoroughly before you put the cat in the water especially if the cat's a long haired breed if any knots are present it will be next to impossible to remove them once the fur is wet talk quietly to your cat and keep a good grip on the neck or shoulders sometimes cats will try to get out of the tub if they prefer to only have two of their feet in the water face them towards the back of the tub and let them stand on two feet choose an appropriate shampoo for the job check with your veterinarian to select the shampoo best suited to your cat's condition human shampoos are not ph adjusted to cat's skin and medicated shampoos may be too harsh or toxic if your cat has fleas use flea shampoo made specifically for cats soak kitty from the neck down using the wash cloth you want to get the water down to the skin use a little bit of shampoo and with the water wash your cat from the neck body legs belly and tail be sure to not get shampoo in their eyes nose mouth or ears rinse thoroughly after shampooing and then rinse two more times you want all the soap out of the coat have two towels for drying ready drain the water from around the cat and press as much water out of the coat before you wrap in the towel rub gently with one towel the first one will be pretty soaked that's why you should switch to the drier one and finish drying until the cat is just damp it helps if you warm the towels in the dryer first finish the drying short haired cats can finish drying themselves in the bathroom as long as they're away from drafts for long haired cats you will have to use a comb and some more towels long hairs will become matted more easily when their fur is wet and it can help to comb them as they dry alternate shower techniques edit recognize that it may be helpful to wash your cat in a shower stall if you have one with a door not curtain the cat is essentially trapped in the shower without you having to hold on make sure the cat has good traction a small towel in the bathtub will help if you have no rubber mat or you will have a panic stricken cat that is likely to seek safety in height by trying to climb you like a tree buy a hose adapter for your bathroom sink try a waterbed store and a hose long enough to reach over the shower door and back down to the shower floor or get a hand held spray shower and a y adapter to connect it to your regular shower head hose your cat down lather her up hose down to rinse then proceed with drying some cats seem to actually enjoy the massage settings on hand held showers especially on the back of the neck and down the ridge of the back some cats can be unnerved by running water try to run a bath when they are distracted and make sure to set aside rinse water in separate prefilled containers this tends to cut down on the scratching also alternate dry shampoo option edit dust the cat with cornstarch gently pet the cat to thoroughly rub the cornstarch into its fur let the cat clean itself with its normal grooming routine this technique is far less traumatic than using water and works especially well if the cat is greasy however use it for non toxic dirt only do not use this technique if the cat has gotten into something poisonous tips edit your cat has its own personality while these are all good suggestions be aware of your cat's reactions and be prepared to adjust tactics accordingly try giving your cat a treat after the bath it might improve the tension for future baths the younger you start bathing your cat the easier it will be as the cat will become familiar with it as part of its routine brave souls may find it easier to put on old clothing and sit in the tub holding the cat however the cat typically likes to be held and letting someone else actually bathe the cat in order to reduce chances of getting scratched you may decide to put your cat inside a mesh laundry bag before bathing her make sure that you are able to keep her head above water at all times this is very traumatic for your cat and will only serve to justify its fears about bathing use it only in urgent situations i e cat covered in potentially toxic substance another idea that some have used which is not so cruel as a little funny is to attach small doll socks to their feet this will not eliminate all of the potential scratching but will help keep in mind that the socks make it difficult for the cat to walk so remove them when the bath is over another useful idea is to put some tape around your cat's paws but not too tight this will keep the cat focused on getting rid of what is on its paws instead of scratching you or even getting out of the water when you have more time run a very shallow warm bath only a cm deep or so to begin with pet the cat and give it a treat if it is food oriented continue at this depth until the cat does not panic and try to escape repeat daily until the cat treats it as part of a routine gradually increasing the depth until it is accepting standing in ins of water as a final step have someone else reassure the cat whilst you use your hand to gently make waves in the water this can take a week or months depending on the cat but it is worth the perseverence to know that you can safely bathe your pet when necessary if all else fails take your cat to a reputable professional pet groomer i e petsmart petco or a vet for their washing they will be able to use techniques to keep the cat calm some cats will do better in an empty tub or sink with water being poured on rather then being put into a tub with water already in it start early in the cat's life train your new kitten once every few weeks by giving it a bath when the cat is older there will be no problem giving it a bath try using baby shampoo it is safer than regular shampoo and if the cat splashes it will not burn their eyes it also makes the coat nice and soft this works with dogs also if you are giving your cat a flea bath wet the area around her neck first fleas will try to escape to the dry areas of the cat which can mean a mass exodus of fleas to the head and face while you are bathing a wet neck will keep them off the head and in contact with the water and flea shampoo another method includes wear long jeans and an old judo gi judo jacket karate is too thin a heavy bathrobe might work as well but the reinforced collar of the gi is ideal for obvious reasons attach a harness to the cat and then tie the harness to the front of the judo gi belt this way the cat cannot escape and should the cat decide to climb you you're relatively well protected place one towel on the floor of the tub so the cat has something to hold onto use a bucket of warm water to wet the fur using hand towels in a sponge bath manner lather and then rinse using more hand towels or a sponge and a fresh bucket of warm water done gently the cat shouldn t mind too much at the end the cat will want to climb you this is okay as you are protected by the judo gi and you can now carry the cat out using the gi as a towel and continue to dry with more towels warnings edit watch out for cat claws if you decide to bathe your cat wearing a thick long sleeved sweater is one way to avoid getting scratched badly while bathing your cat be patient and gentle it is natural for cats to fight the water because it simply doesn't feel right if you don't know how to properly hold a cat by the scruff don't do it your cat may choke don't put shampoo on their head it could get in their eyes be aware that you shouldn't bathe him frequently this technique is just in case your pet is really dirty although some cats may accept the bath without great complaints they may get nervous or angry or too scared when you try to dry them be careful during this last phase shut the door of the bathroom or the cat will run away all wet keep it calm or it will urinate creating a big mess if you find your cat objects too much to a bath by hissing at you and trying to escape then forget the bath use a wet washcloth instead it removes the outer dirt and cleans well at your local pet store you can find treated cloths that need no water to be used to groom the cat they even have a pleasant scent hair dryers are not made for cats the heat is too hot for their body do not use your hair dryer to dry your cat's fur cats absorb chemicals through their skin so they must be very well rinsed rinse until you see only clear water running off the cat make sure to use specially formulated shampoo for cats your hair is different from that of your cat and your shampoo will only irritate your cat's skin do not use flea shampoos for dogs on your cat they may contain ingredients that are harmful to your cat be sure to read the label on all products and be aware that some flea products formulated for cats may still cause a reaction do not bathe your pet any more than once every two weeks excessive bathing may remove protective oils from its fur making it appear dull and reducing the fur's natural efficiency against the elements never use sinks that are freestanding because your cat might jump and slip from being wet and hurt itself never get soap in your cat's eyes as a safeguard put to drops of eye lubricant into each eye just before bathing you can use any human labelled eye drops that are indicated as a non medicated occular lubricant often used for dry eye syndrome they are available as over the counter otc products at most drug stores examples include tears natural ii drops or as a gel genteal similarly do not get soapy water into your cat's ears to minimize the risk of creating an ear infection otitis externa put a pledget of cotton in each ear don't forget to take them out at the end of the bath the cotton may also reduce the noise and make your job easier at the very least your cat may be pre occupied with the cotton in its ears and remain distracted if your cats ears are particularly filthy gently wipe the insides with a warm damp wash cloth with no soap cat's ears contain protective waxes and oils that should not be removed always wash your towels after the bath leaving wet towels in a hamper may rot them and it is more hygienic to clean the towels quickly listen for sounds of unhappiness these sounds include hissing growling breathing hard sneezing crying and mewing avoid using a blow dryer on a short haired cat or kitten as it may burn them and or cause more trauma short haired cats can bathe themselves dry never force your cat's head under the water to wash their head and face use a wash cloth things you'll need edit basic grooming tools comb brush nail clippers towels rubber mat for bottom of tub cat shampoo and conditioner

cats traveling overseas i may be moving overseas and i was wondering what the options for taking you cats with you on an air plane with are my cats a completely different but they are both freaked out when it comes to any traveling i heard about tranquilizers but i don't really know too much about it i would rather have both of my cats sleep through out the ride of course i would go to a veterinary before any of this happends to get opinions and vacinations but i thought i would ask here as well thanks there are very strict rules in many countries about bringing pets along often there is a variable quarantine time where your pet must be in a kennel as well as guidelines about vaccines etc just something else to consider as well as the plane ride there are some sedatives that your vet might recommend when it comes time to travel one non prescription sedative that works really great on my cat is rescue remedy a bach flower essence that you can get at most holistic natural food stores your vet will probably tell you this but try anything that you are going to give before the trip you don't want your kitties to have a bad reaction in the middle of the trip you must make a reservation for your animal with the airline when you get your tickets which will be extra what a ripoff as long as your cats aren't monster sized they should be able to ride with you in the cabin which i would recommend unless they are going to holler the entire time any soft sided carrier thats labeled for airline travel will work and then you just put them under the seat in front of you they are considered your carry on but you must still pay money to have them with you fyi my small dog travels wonderfully on a plane often when i leave people comment they didn't even know there was an animal aboard i have never taken an overseas flight with her though you also need to consider food water litterbox availability if you're going to be on a really long flight your vet can probably make recommendations once you figure out how long you will be in the air and what your layovers are  Cat Pet skunk Ryanair Airline Dog Rabies Public transport RuneScape quests Veterinarian Garfield Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ferret Hong Kong International Airport Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Guinea pig Boeing 747 Docking Socialization Aircraft USS Waters (DD-115) USS Enterprise (CVN-65) Hamster The Amazing Race USS Forrestal (CVA-59) RuneScape locations Domestic rabbit Lisa the Vegetarian Pan American World Airways Malaysia Airlines Mattress Air New Zealand Food and Drug Administration Microchip implant (animal) MN Airlines, LLC Vietnam Airlines Fancy rat Greyhound Friends USS Wallace L.

advice for moving with cats i am about to move into a new apartment with my two cats my youngest one i'm not worried about however my oldest one who is about has moved with me before and does not adjust well i know that cats don't adjust well to change and need to recognize their scent in the new home however she doesn't adjust to the point of not using her litter box even after being shown where it is there is new carpet in the apartment i am moving into i'm looking for any advice that will help my morgan adjust without urinating all over the brand new carpet thank you territory means everything to a cat it is the source of food love and shelter so the perceived loss of territory through a house move can be very upsetting to them on arrival day keep the cats in their travel basket while you set up one room of the apartment with their familiar items bed blanket towel toys litter tray food and water you can then get on with moving everything in knowing that your cats are safe in one room later in the day when everything has been moved in you can allow them access to explore one or two other rooms of the apartment as you know they also rely very heavily on their sense of smell when they rub up against doorways or furniture they are very subtly marking their territory the new apartment obviously won't have the familiar communal scent of your old home which will add to any feelings of insecurity if they have a favourite blanket or something else they like to sleep on you could try wiping that over the paintwork at cat head height you could also try stroking them with a soft cloth and then wiping that over decorated areas as that will help reinstate their scent a feliway spray or a plug in diffuser will have a similar effect as it contains a scent said to resemble soothing cat pheromones use food and a regular routine to help your cats settle in small frequent meals will give you more contact initially and help to reassure your cats that all is well by knowing when and where feeding will take place they can anticipate the meal rather than worry about it this also helps them to relax and promotes a feeling of well being moving home can be traumatic for an indoor cat that may not be used to dealing with changes in the environment to the same extent that an outdoor cat will be slow careful introductions one room at a time with lots of reassurance will help the cats settle in if your year old is particularly nervous and you are very concerned about her reaction it might be an idea to board them in a friendly cattery before the move and keep them away from the new apartment until everything is unpacked and you've had chance to furnish the apartment with theirs and your scent the web article below will give you further advice and suggestions on making the house move as stress free as possible for your cats http www sniksnak com cathealth moving html good luck hope all goes well  Hamster Dog Japanese tea ceremony Pet skunk Domestic rabbit Sento Kitchen Menstrual cycle Animal communication Fecal incontinence Kakapo Japanese toilet Mid-levels Urinary incontinence Bedbug House Mouse Sauna Stomach cancer World Wide Web Strap-on dildo Animal Crossing Upholstery Ferret Poker jargon Buckingham Palace Mattress Friends Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shaggy dog story RuneScape quests Traumatic brain injury Surveillance Cyberspace Combat stress reaction Charles Darwin's illness Skunk Basement Fire fighting Housebreaking Airport Rei Ayanami Miss Saigon Insomnia The Smoking Room Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Smoking ban Chatsworth House DDT Tlingit The Star Wars Holiday Special Tai shogi The Time Machine Chair Gay bathhouse Sears Holdings Corporation Thermal power station Felis sapiens Lighting Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Flea Abbey Oh My Goddess!

how come cats go in a trance when theyre carried by the neck its because it reverts them back to kitten hood when there mother used to carry them that way usually to safety this explains why the cat feels safe and comfortable when this is done a cat sees you as its mother and because of the safety that his her mother provided its learned that being carried by the neck is not a bad experience all though some cats will fight it if they are really feral  Socialization Cat Feral Hunting Ranma __ characters Scenes from a Memory Pitaten The Amber Spyglass The Shining (film) Feral cat Milton H.

serious cat problems i have a month old male cat and he is very naughty when we went to pick out a cat at the shelter they just had all of the kittens running around he was very quite and alone and would get picked on by all of the other kittens he was also one of the littlest ones there he was around weeks when we picked him up from there when we brought him home he adapted to the litter box right away and i would take him up into my room at night so that he would not bother my mom and disabled brother at night after about week of taking him up into my room he ended up pooping under my bed we thought it was because of me taking him up to my room everynight we felt as if he felt restrained or that he has to stay up there so the next night i didn't bring him up stairs and he was fine for about month then my brother had a bath chair in the bathtub and my cat peed in that chair then he was fine for a while and then my mom found a wet spot on the bathroom rug she thinks he peed there he also tends to be very agressive i know that it is play agression but then he tends to pee on things after we make him mad how do you stop this oh and more thing the cat has always been very nice and only play agression was the problem but now he will bite my ear chin lip or nose when he is around me it seems as though he is saying that he is the boss how do you stop this as it is very annoying as when i try to sleep and someone is biting my face it is not a hard bite just a soft nibble but his soft nibble can still be a little annoying i have tried scruffing him by the neck when he does this but he just waits seconds and then does it again in usually the same spot please help me cause if the cat keeps peeing my mom says that we will have to get rid of him and i do not want and neither does she but she does not want him to ruin the house sry this is soo long one last thing his urine doesn't smell right away normal cats pick their places to eliminate on the basis of it feels safe and private and they have been there before they go back to the place where they've left their smell the cat's litter box may not be in a place he perceives as safe and private you might need to relocate it it may also not be clean enough for him don't give him this excuse scoop it out often at least twice a day more often if you can and change the litter at least once a week to get rid of the smell where he has made a mess outside of his litter box get the preparation called get serious from pet smart you may also be able to order it online if a pet smart store is not near you use it exactly as directed everywhere the cat has made a mess with a brush and some rags to blot the surface dry then wash that surface with hot soapy water with a cup of white vinegar in it when you get rid of the smell he should stop returning to these places good luck failing to use a litterbox is a way that a cat lets you know that something about his life is not quite right or not to his liking in that situation people smoke overeat undereat drink sleep with strangers and do drugs cats crap the floor i have a nervous cat who has the occasional discontented spell and pees on the floor right next to the litterbox no matter how clean i keep it he has done so recently because he wants to go out and i've been making him stay in because we've got a heat wave on here the get serious stuff will at the very least help you keep your home smelling clean despite the little cat's lapses  Hamster 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sin City Social rule Garfield Sento Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Pitaten Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Friends The Inside Phoebe Buffay's songs RuneScape quests Fancy rat Toilet Toilet humour Japanese toilet Ron Weasley Ron and Fez Textile manufacturing Dog training Customs and etiquette of Japan Sauna Humphrey Bogart The Adventures of Pete & Pete Characters in the Smurfs Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Dog The Fairly OddParents Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Pet skunk Japanese tea ceremony Jackass: The Movie Mattress Shit Red Dwarf characters Blood Simple Russian joke Calvin and Hobbes Milton H.

why do so many cats wander around reading through this forum i saw someone ask about poisoning cats the entire population jumped up and down on him about it while i disagree with his methods i failed to see a single cat owner stand up and say anything about being responsible for the actions of their pet s not everyone likes cats and not everyone wants the neighbor's cat to stroll into their yard kill the plants birds and leave surprises usually found after stepping in while cutting the grass many suggested calling animal control while one insisted that the local animal control would respond immediately very quickly with traps or even to trap them yourself and take them to the local animal control i live sixty miles from the nearest town of over population rather than inconvenience myself for the neighbor's annoying pet wouldn't it be a better solution if the neighbor would be a better pet owner answer fairy if you'd like to discuss all the rest of the world's problems there are forii for that i'm sure yeah i guess i deserve to step in cat sh t every week because you feel that allowing a pet to wander unsupervised is somehow less irresponsible than beating the same pet as for my petty problem was that pun intended or not why did you address said problem in the same post that you attempt to belittle me i think you're just a lonely person that has issues with socializing with others and you'll grow up one day and the neighbor kids will call you that crazy cat lady if you want to discuss spousal and family abuse or if you're a victim or guilty of it i can find some links for help if you want uh oh some of you think i have issues with pets specifically cats not at all i've owned probably dozen cats in my life not all at once the litter bill would be abhorent and have always been a responsible pet owner someone asked about natural predators there are many animals that feed on mice rats moles etc hawks owls foxes coyotes snakes just to name that ones off the top of my head my issue is not with feral or wild animals my question was about irresponsibility on the part of pet owners gee krista you spending time with the answer fairy you missed the point of the question you ignored everything else i posted after the question apparently because i don't want irresponsible pet owner's to mistreat their animals i'm an animal hater on what planet is it right for me to have to move to the city because some pet owners apparently you fall into this group feel that their rights to abuse their pets trumps my right to not have to deal with something i don't care to don't own and don't want to clean up after oh well i tried to ask a civil question and apparently the more moronic of the crowd would rather make asinine comments move to the city you deserve to step in than reply with a decent answer should've known schools out for the summer and the kiddies are as unsupervised as the pets s'long oh and one more thing krista if you had the comprehension reading skills and ability to read context you might actually have seen where i said i disagree with poisoning of animals however deciding to have a knee jerk reaction on your part was seemingly more gratifying than actually attempting to understand leave off the knee and you'll realize what you look like just for the record in texas it is not illegal nor is it considered animal cruelty to kill a nuisance animal whether cat or dog or opossum or coyote or whatever that's just for those of you that think i am advocating the killing of animals and think they can scare me with threats and hyperbole naturally the world would be a better place if people were responsible for themselves and their animals personally i have indoor only cats who live a pampered life in the lap of luxury they never go outside personally i get pretty ticked off when people don't pick up their dog poop especially in parks where kids play unfortunatly the world is full of people who beat and starve their animals wives and children some people don't know any better while others just don't think animals have feelings some people even believe that it is okay to use dogs for fighting think about it you want to cast stones at people who let their cats outside but otherwise take wonderful care of their animals dude you are on the wrong path you should be ticked off at people who abuse their pets your petty annoyance is so ridiculous when you consider the atrocities that are committed every day you deserve to step in cat poop while mowing your lawn  Cat Theory of conduct Feral cat Dog Shaggy dog

any special way to give a kitten a bath and not by wiping it with a wet rag either maybe i should re word this judging by the first answers how do i give a kitten a bath without using a wet rag i should explain these babies are basically orphans their mama is not taking care of them i am they are really dirty and homely looking how do i give them a bath it's a little different from giving an adult cat a bath kittens are just a bit shocked by the whole procedure and don't give you a hard time about it it will be most comfortable for you to use the kitchen sink especially if it has a sprayer you can put a towel on the bottom so kitty's feet won't slip run a small amount of warm water in the sink and stand the kitten in the water and gently wet down his body put one drop of dish detergent to see how much lather you get if you think it's not enough then one more drop don't pour it on and get the kitty so lathered up that you will be rinsing it for an hour use dawn dish soap and not a flea shampoo the fleas drown in the water anyway and there is no need to risk putting chemicals on the kitten dawn cuts grease and grime very well you won't get all the fleas they will go up the nose into ears etc to avoid drowning you just need to comb the kitten a lot to get all the fleas off lots of nice bath towels to massage the baby all over and get him very dry and keep the kitten out of drafts for a while to be sure he is very dry  Shampoo Sento Sauna Breastfeeding Cat Menstrual cup Textile manufacturing Hard water Manicure Towel Drowning Soap Phoebe Buffay's songs Massage Hamster Chinchilla First aid Customs and etiquette of Japan Dishwasher Car washing techniques Dry cleaning Fire extinguisher Swimming Dishwashing Detergent Japanese toilet Hand washing Diaper Japanese tea ceremony Soap bubble Kitten Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Social rule Hyperthermia Childbirth Tattoo Ranma __ characters Urinary incontinence Joke Hello Kitty Dialysis Bathing Fire fighting Diseases of the honeybee Equine conformation Pedicure Hydrotherapy Sewage treatment Gay bathhouse Upholstery Cruising (maritime) Basic English Hypothermia Mattress Pottery Psoriasis Washing machine Garfield Wound Flea Feral cat Eczema Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story Cuteness Carbon dioxide Happy Tree Friends Procter & Gamble Diving suit Hazing Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Photography Cheese Sulfuric acid Toilet paper Characters in the Smurfs Brewery Water (molecule) Domestic rabbit Campfire Urticaria Body piercing Mosquito Fecal incontinence Paper towel Shaving USS Tunny (SS-282) My Little Pony Collodion process EastEnders Professional wrestling holds Washroom Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

siamese cat rash can't believe i'm asking this after telling several worried pet owners to just go to the vet i now find myself with an injured cat we plan on bringing her if her condition gets worse money isn't an issue but at the moment she is getting better my question to cat owners siamese owners in particular is if their cats have ever experienced rashes when we got home last night we noticed my sister's siamese kitten had a bloody neck we nearly died thinking she'd cut an artery but she barely noticed it she has no cuts or scraps so we're not sure if she had a fight with her sister or if she has a heat rash if it's possible for cats to get heat rashes like i said it's getting better we wrapped her neck with gauze so she couldn't scratch it and she's just sleeping now still what could it have been she is an indoor cat we sometimes take her outside on a leash but we haven't since we lost it she does suffer from allergies though her eyes weep when she's around dust but the house is clean i'm not sure if she's come into contact with any chemicals they are up high but i don't watch her so it's a possibility that is interesting the girls eat from porcelain bowls and drink from one of those metal dishes but we are in a brand new modular house now that i think about it we haven't been here for more than a few weeks so perhaps it is something in this house i never thought of bugs either we have no spiders inside but our friends have been having flea problems we haven't found any yet but that doesn't mean some haven't gotten in she also loves chasing the moths that get in the house they are usually out of her reach but i'd imagine she'd eat them if she ever got a hold of them we use a flea earworm medication called revolution it's applied to the back of the neck not where the rash is we've also been using it for months i won't rule it out as a factor though we use a flea earworm medication called revolution it's applied to the back of the neck not where the rash is we've also been using it for months i won't rule it out as a factor though towards the top of the page it says gearxs part wpn condition refurbished condition details packaging plain box packaging details shipping cost beneath that it reads shipping and handling free to united states yes cats can get rashes mine are allergic to fleas one fricken flea bite and the whole world goes to h e double hockey sticks could be she got bitten by a spider or a bug or a flea and she scratched the bejeezus out of her neck could be she got tangled up on something trying to escape could be anything you need to have it cleaned though if it's not that bad get some anti bacterial soap on a wash cloth not too much and clean the area also antibiotic ointment ain't just for people put a tiny bit on the neck and then re wrap it in the guaze check it in a few hours  Cat Fancy rat Guinea pig Garfield Allergy Flea First aid Tattoo Sin City Shaggy dog story Pet skunk Richard Chase Conspiracy (TNG episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Eczema The Amber Spyglass Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Shining (film) EastEnders Milton H.

why does my kitten want to climb in the fridge my grandma just got aeight week old kitten a few weeks ago and he's a complete love to be around he's very affectionate though he does have his quirks he'll eat anything last night he crawled into a bag of potato chips and was munching on the when i found him he also seems to like to try and climb in the toilet for some odd reason but what i really want to know is if anyone knows why he'd want to get into the fridge gram accidently left him in the fridge the day after she got him and then she found him hours later curled up between the lettece and orange juice purring ever since whenever we open the fridge door he's right there at our ankles mewing and trying to climb in anyone know why he's acting so weird i am not saying this to be funny but you have heard of curiosity killed the cat cat are very curious and they want to explore everything that is new to them when i got my little kitten from the shelter she was curious about everything everytime i opened the frig she would jump in the very first time she did it i was so thankful that i saw her do it because i was getting ready to leave for work where i worked hours and it took me hour to get to work it would have been at least hours before i would have gotten back home i still cry when i think about what could have happened the frig is air tight and i don't know if she would have had enough air for that long i just got into the habit of checking before i closed the frig to make sure she wasn't in there because she did manage to get in there a couple of times without me seeing her jump in there that only lasted for a lttle while and she no longer does that also you might want to keep the lid to the toilet down as if she did jump in she might not be able to get out you didn't mention the oven but that is something that you want to be careful with too make sure he is not around when you open the the oven especially if it is hot and always check the oven before you turn it on when i was little my little brother thought it would be funny to hide our cat in the oven luckily i was walking by and heard her in there and got her out and i had a nice long talk with my little brother he never put the kitty in the oven again good luck with your new little kitty  Shaggy dog story Cat Salad Fingers Poker jargon RuneScape quests The Dalek Invasion of Earth Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Dean Koontz The Amber Spyglass Rais massacre The Inside AFI 100 Years series Atomic Kitten The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Lovely Bones Conspiracy (TNG episode) Good Times Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sluggy Freelance Time Out of Mind Russian joke Futurama (TV series - season 5) Social rule Fecal incontinence Badly Drawn Kitties Humphrey Bogart Little Britain The Shining (film) Piccolo Junior Saga Friends Guinea pig Hun-Apu Saturday Night Live Shit The Star Wars Holiday Special Toilet humour Hamster Everybody Loves Raymond One Piece minor characters The Time Machine Pitaten Trailer Park Boys The Ersatz Elevator Joke Barbecue Phoebe Buffay's songs Methos Heinkel He 112 Ferret Blonde on Blonde "Weird Al" Yankovic Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Reservoir Dogs The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Microwave oven The Catcher in the Rye Eddie Guerrero Knots Landing Cliff Richard Silent Night, Deadly Night Mojave people Malcolm in the Middle Steven Wright Refrigerator Highway 61 Revisited Sonic the Hedgehog Soap opera Cats (musical) The Ark in Space Captain Thunderbolt StarCraft: Hybrid Columbine High School massacre Care Bears Big Brother UK series 5 Daylight saving time Milton H.

it is bad to use i use a gallon gravity feed water container for my two cats on a regular day to day basis i realize that these containers are made for travel purposes thus not really made for regular use my question is is it safe and sanitary to use this for my cats every day if i'm careful to clean out the entire container with hot water and soap obviously i'm certain to get all the soap out every few days when i change their water i use this large container because unfortunately i'm not wonderful at remembering to feed water them each day it won't do any harm to your cats as long as you are remembering to wash it out every few days and with the remembering to feed and water for your little lovlies i tend to do the same but one of my cats warns me when its getting low by meowing at my feet and walking over to the dish  Menstrual cup Dairy Dishwashing Soap bubble Tattoo Hamster Cookware and bakeware Japanese tea ceremony Sento Brewery Hard water Textile manufacturing Nuclear fallout Cruising (maritime) Autonomous building Goldfish Social rule Washing machine Cat Hygiene Soap Sewer Agar plate Dry cleaning Fecal incontinence Sewage treatment Japanese toilet Panama Canal Soap opera Domestic rabbit Car washing techniques Vinegar Pebble bed reactor Derbyshire lead mining history Marine aquarium Car wash Seabird Tofu Fossil fuel power plant Nuclear power Hand washing Water cannon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Laundry detergent The Apprentice 2 Foodborne illness Fire extinguisher Coffee Richard Feynman Customs and etiquette of Japan Escherichia coli O157:H7 Water Dishwasher Eifel Aqueduct 2004 Atlantic hurricane season National Weather Service Laundry Scuba set Wine making Violin Density Gravity Breastfeeding Jennings Randolph Lake Coriolis effect Mutual fund Nobiin language Arrow of time Publicly funded medicine Seismic retrofit Lake District Mountaineering Morphology (linguistics) Hiking Tsunami Lunar Prospector Hemp The Wash Better Than Life StarCraft: Uprising Pet skunk Energy development Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Scientology beliefs and practices Canada Health Act Steam locomotive nomenclature Dam Domestic water system The Star Wars Holiday Special Hollywood Squares 2003 North America blackout Utility cycling Rose (Doctor Who) Garfield Menstrual cycle Egg (food) Ice cream Internal ballistics We'll Always Have Paris (TNG episode)

does anyone know of a pet insurance that covers existing conditions our cat was taken into the vets today and diagonsed with asthma does anyone know of an insurance company that accepts pets with new conditions richard no pet insurance company will cover pre existing conditions for any reason however many distinguish between curable conditions and non curable for example if your dog broke his leg prior to enrolling then treatment related to that leg would be excluded for first policy term after that coverage would then be available for that leg thus a broken leg would most likely be considered curable on the other hand if your dog had a history of back problems prior to enrolling herniated discs etc then all back problems would likely be excluded in other words back problems would fall into the category of non curable remember that most insurance no matter what sort won't cover pre existing conditions for example you can't get auto insurance after you've had an accident and you can't get home insurance after a tree has fallen on it getting insurance means being prepared and taking it out when things are going well as the saying goes insurance is the one thing you can't get when you need it the most alex embrace pet insurance http www embracepetinsurance com  Life insurance Health insurance Contract Auto insurance Intellectual property Legal aspects of transsexualism Risk management Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Classified information Mortgage Predestination Critique of Pure Reason Home insurance Asthma Publicly funded medicine Dog training Ethics Microeconomics Philosophy of language Health care in the United States Causality Medicare (Canada) Homeopathy Science Public domain Church of Christ, Scientist Logic Mixed-breed dog Schengen treaty Title insurance Blackjack Wal-Mart Pet skunk Transsexuality Annuity Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Cultural relativism Microchip implant (animal) Hearing impairment Nudism Productive and unproductive labour Domestic rabbit Patent Doomsday argument Drug abuse Ferret Swahili language World Wide Web Fundamentalism Epistemology T'Pol Memento (film) Hillary Rodham Clinton Professional wrestling holds Financial services Democratic Party (United States) Immortality Hypnosis Kevin and Kell Capitalism Liability insurance Morphology (linguistics) Trade union Bond Phimosis Hamster Extreme Programming Chiropractic Existence Money The nature of God in Western theology Transgender Public policy Tennis Acupuncture Thermodynamics Karl Marx Medical malpractice Abstraction Health maintenance organization Segregated cycle facilities Grief Animal rights Treaty Osteopathy Professional wrestling throws Medicare (United States) Garfield Actuary Circumscription Buddhism Childbirth Paranoia Agent Mother Teresa Sciatica Havelock Vetinari Aphasia

where did house cats come from were there wild cats i mean i know they were domesticated some how but where did they come from some extinct small cat research points out that domestic cats can be traced to wild progenitors that interbred well over years ago the origin of today's cats is from lybica a middle eastern wildcat according to stephen j o'brien of the national cancer institute domestication took place in the middle east though the current day felines look very different from what lybica used to look like it is sure that the original cat was the mid eastern cat according to the findings the ancestry of cats has been traced to five types of wild cats but that doesn't mean they were domesticated five times these five types managed to interbreed at various times with the result being felis silvestris lybica which appears to be the ancestor of modern house cats the study suggests  Wild Cat Dingo Leopard Cat Domestication Species Dog Stone Age Ferret International Code of Zoological Nomenclature Shillourokambos Feral cat Aurochs Family name Race Single-origin hypothesis Archaeology and the Book of Mormon Asiatic Golden Cat Mink Primate Phantom cat Hybrid Bengal cat Domestication of the horse Manx (cat) Indo-Aryan migration Gray Wolf Red Wolf Domestic sheep Lion Genealogical DNA test Evolution Neolithic Europe Palestinian Domestic rabbit Leopard Human skin color Cradle of Humanity Liger Tiger Carnivora Red Deer Cheetah Puma Island Fox Neanderthal Felis sapiens Maltese tiger Mammal Serval Biodiversity Common descent Prostate cancer Plant breeding Gross domestic product Cat's Eye Nebula Saber-toothed cat Feral Semitic Natural selection Toronto Blue Jays Europe Cat coat genetics Kitten Wheat Melanin Caracal Felix the Cat Civet Pashtun American lion Cheshire cat Catwoman Genealogy Machairodontinae African American Prehistoric Britain Black (people) Evolution of the Horse Clouded Leopard Reindeer Bobcat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Darwin from Orchids to Variation Tatars Coral Egyptian Mau Molecular systematics Mummy Stomach cancer H5N1 Tobacco smoking Maine Coon Mammoth Cave lion Tajiks Dinosaur Colorectal cancer Sea level rise

is it safe to apply frontline to a cat twice in once month i applied frontline a few days ago and she still has fleas wondering if it would be safe to apply it again she is about months old no do not overuse this product it's poison that's how it kills the fleas it can become toxic to your cat if you don't follow the instructions and to you for that matter be sure to wash your hands after applying i personally prefer advantage or advantage plus i think it's a much better product and works better than frontline if your cat has fleas after using the frontline bathe her using a mild dish soap like palmolive it will kill all the fleas don't use this routinely because it can cause skin problems with cats as it's formulated for dishes instead of the ph on a cat's skin however it works wonderful in a pinch note do not reapply frontline use only once a month the bathing does not wash it away since it's absorbed into the cat's skin  Psoriasis Shampoo Eczema Soap Menstrual cup Manicure Foodborne illness Flea Cat Menstrual cycle Hamster Aluminium Hard water Sento Donald Rumsfeld Chinchilla Pesticide Morphology (linguistics) Wound Embalming Tattoo Paracetamol Hyperthermia Heartworm Autism Acne Sunlight Cruising (maritime) Common cold Anthrax Smoke-screen Drug test Minor Harry Potter Beasts Richard Feynman Dracunculiasis Vitamin D Aloe Dishwashing Agar plate Livestock Thimerosal Rice Skin Boom Town (Doctor Who) Social rule First aid Boric acid Jade Emperor Richard Chase Fecal incontinence Potato Animal testing Customs and etiquette of Japan Pepper spray Japanese toilet Ultraviolet Hair Diseases of the honeybee The Amber Spyglass Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Dog Ranma __ characters Electrophysiology One Piece minor characters Car washing techniques Feral cat SS-Sturmbrigade Dirlewanger Jute Hygiene Canary Napoleon I of France John Frusciante Nutmeg Fugu Scientology beliefs and practices Clothing Kosher foods Urea Spanish verbs DDT Kakapo Saint Certified Nursing Assistant 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Explosive material Laboratory Sewage treatment Scabies Tobacco Escherichia coli O157:H7 Chronic fatigue syndrome Poison Towel Cheese Bubonic plague Linked list Cytomegalovirus Frontline (Australian TV series) Breastfeeding

how do you know when a cat that you just found had kittens i just found a cat that was in a field for a long time and i dont know how to tell if she already had kittens do you mean kittens at the moment or kittens previously in her life i'm no vet but a cat that has had kittens will have more pronounced nipples whereas a fixed cat of the same age will not if she has kittens currently she will have nipples carrying milk swollen hair pushed back from them pregnant cats often get very friendly but nervous their stomachs will get round if you looked at her from the top not just fat from the saggy bottom but not look fat like obese cats her nipples will also be tender and swollen a fixed cat that's never had kittens will also have a floppy saggy belly so don't go by that  Cat Guinea pig Breastfeeding Kitten Phoebe Buffay's songs Garfield Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chocolate Rabbit Atomic Kitten RuneScape quests Nipple Manx (cat) Friends Jam (TV series) Toxoplasmosis Mammary gland Professional wrestling throws Thermoregulation Cats (musical) Ferret Purr Umphrey's McGee Alley Cat Mattress Felix the Cat Cornish Rex Tick Feral cat Hair Equine conformation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma House Mouse Socialization Internal ballistics Garfield and Friends Goatse.cx Bottlenose Dolphin Platypus Diesel Sweeties Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers Fat acceptance movement Girly Leopard Through the Looking-Glass Obstetrics Yoghurt Every time you masturbate___ God kills a kitten The Beatles bootlegs Cheshire cat Ron and Fez Invader Zim Supernumerary nipple Big Brother UK series 5 Japanese Bobtail (cat) Fancy rat Nipple piercing Bast (goddess) B3ta Aerial (dance move) Abdomen Lynx Puberty Milk Homer Simpson Shaggy dog story Puma Breast Bobcat Ethosuximide Bengal cat Infant Carolina Panthers Marc Antony and Pussyfoot Body piercing Felis sapiens Atari 8-bit family Echidna Jon Secada Azumanga Daioh Mammal Trans fat Cheetah Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy Adjustable gastric band Janet Jackson Coffee Bagpuss Andr__s Galarraga Namir Deiter Acne Doug Slovak language Greebo The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters Black panther Comanche Ren and Stimpy

impotant question about cat neutering please answer if you really know i'd like to know what is the earliest a cat can be neutered but i don't want to know the ideal circumstances which i know is at months old i need to find the earliest because i have taken a feral kitten to the vet for an eye problem the kitten will be operated but he has lost an eye already he will go back to being a feral cat in his neighbourhood where i found him so we won't have the chance to catch him again but i don't want him to get into cat fights with one eye he can't afford to lose another eye the vet says he can be neutered later but i am under the impression that in the us you neuter them much earlier at the vet hospital where i work we usually neuter kittens when they weigh four pounds which is at about to months of age however studies have shown that earlier neutering and spaying does no harm and the cats mature normally many animal shelters neuter and spay kittens at the earliest age they allow them to be adopted which is usually at weeks  Cat Feral cat Kitten Socialization Ferret Pet skunk Guinea pig Dog Domestic rabbit Garfield Animal shelter Manx (cat) Castration Housebreaking Animal euthanasia Sterilization (surgical procedure) Puma Bob Barker The Joker's Wild Treecat Red Fox Bobcat Through the Looking-Glass Turkish Van Cheetah Great Dane Phoebe Buffay's songs Prostate cancer Peter Singer Czech language Spanish pronouns Game show Asiatic Golden Cat Microchip implant (animal) Domestication Grammatical gender The Price Is Right Bulgarian language The Contender (television series) Kangaroo Feral child Gray Wolf Veterinarian Big Brother UK series 5 Louis Wain Fancy rat Rabbit Breastfeeding A Star is Torn Chuck Jones Polish language Pet store Cuteness European Rabbit SMTV Live Goatse.cx Cats (musical) Introduced species Cowboy Bebop Albatross Wild Cat Sabretooth (comics) Joy Division (band) Abortion debate Kakapo Randomness German grammar Seabird Stuttering Gender Pitaten The Aristocats Delta Goodrem Animal communication Minor Harry Potter Beasts Planetary nebula House Mouse Puss in Boots Azumanga Daioh Octopus Horse Cat Stevens Hamster Siamese (cat) Feral cat colony Southern American English David H.

what is the best way to introduce a mature cat to a new kitten who's been added to the household my cat is years old and is a huge baby she was raised with another adult cat and a golden retriever and they got along splendidly things didn't go so well when a welsh corgi puppy was brought into the family she never learned to get along with that dog even after years me and the cat recently moved out and she seems to be loving all the attention although i worry that she gets lonely and bored while i'm at work mainly i'm worried because about years ago i was kittensitting a friend's cat and she was ready to kill it since then i've been afraid to get another cat advice have the kitten stay in a closed off room for the first days this way the older cat may get a scent of the kitten and begin to recognize this then replace the closed door with a baby gate for another days so they may view eachother and start to become familiar you must coax and praise your older kitty constantly when they finally are introducted showing the kitten very little attention make sure that they have seperate food dishes seperate litter boxes and seperate toys for at least the first months again make sure that you give older kitty the most attention when the kitten is around good luck  Cat Kitten RuneScape quests Dog Garfield Socialization Girly Ferret Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pet skunk Housebreaking Care Bears Shaggy dog story Dean Koontz Badly Drawn Kitties Ren and Stimpy Dog training Sharon Tate Cats (musical) Atomic Kitten EastEnders Nintendo Hamster Pitaten Rugrats Days of our Lives Kakapo Doug Guinea pig Little Britain Natural Selection (computer game) Xiaolin Showdown Elizabeth Taylor Nintendogs Dog agility Golden Retriever Big Brother UK series 5 The Fairly OddParents God Emperor of Dune Hello Kitty Our Gang Siamese (cat) Phoebe Buffay's songs Ron and Fez Ranma __ characters German Shepherd Dog Alaga__sia Piccolo Junior Saga Garfield and Friends Characters in the Smurfs AFI 100 Years series The Star Wars Holiday Special Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Kodocha Kangaroo Sarah Kerrigan Cliff Richard Gray Wolf B3ta Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Poker jargon Azumanga Daioh Cat litter Taboo food and drink The Amber Spyglass The Death Gate Cycle Kim Possible Manx (cat) Weebl and Bob StarCraft: Hybrid Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) Dead Like Me Series finale Lady and the Tramp The Critic Elephant Jon Secada Cheetah Humphrey Bogart Britney Spears Scooby-Doo Treecat Anna Karenina Sin City Miss Saigon The Amazing Race Ultimate Spider-Man All My Children The Contender (television series) Tenshinhan Kingdom Hearts Fancy rat Puma Friends

cat problems help my wife and i adopted a wonderful cat from a rescue society his name is truman and is a wonderful pet he only sleeps on his back likes to play in water and is very affectionate we love him to death we've had him for months now and some problems are starting to arise despite using bitter apple and bitter yuck he eats the plants we even used a hot pepper spray and he still eats the plants not only that he is digging and eating the dirt the plants are growing in despite more spray and slices of habanero pepper to top it all off he has started to chew on cords and cables all over the house the lamp shades boxes shoes and anything else he can get his mouth on and before you ask no he is not teething this cannot continue we cannot go around the house every morning and evening unplugging and putting away all electronics shoes plants boxes and everything else any suggestions on what we can do we love him and do not want to return him to the society i take it that dental problems of any kind have been eliminated by a vet is he an indoor only cat it sounds as though he might be bored and in his search for something to amuse himself he is inadvertently getting into mischief for the chewing problem there are a few things that you can try to break the habit i know this may not be easy but wherever possible you need to deny him any access to those items that she's chewing buy some trunking to cover cables and electrical wires the items that you cannot store away put eucalyptus or menthol oil on them cats hate the smell you can also leave bait pieces of cable or an old shoe on which a few drops of menthol or oil of eucalyptus have been rubbed this deterrent will often reform the most ardent chewers sometimes denial for a couple of weeks causes the behaviour to stop shouting at the cat or squirting water at him when you catch him in the act isn't advised as you may just find he resorts to chewing these items in secret or when you are not there instead use a favourite toy or food treat to distract him and focus his attention elsewhere if it's the chewing sensation that he enjoys then try providing him with tough chunks of meat to eat this means he will have to spend more time focused on eating his meal cats like digging in soft soil place small pebbles or stones over the soil and he won't be able to access it any more cats need to eat grass from time to time for health reasons stomach ache etc so providing him with his own pot of cat grass may keep him off your others if he is an indoor only cat would you consider allowing him outside for brief periods either under your supervision or on a harness if he were allowed outside this will further his level of mental stimulation and will reduce the importance of home for activity make sure you set aside time each day strictly for playing games with him so as to focus his attention on things other than chewing there is a theory that for some cats an early interest in playing with cables or string has developed into predatory handling the end sequence of which is to consume the prey some cats make the mental leap straight from stalking to consumption try interactive toys such as those that dangle off the end of a wandstick as they will keep him physically and mentally fit they're ideal toys for playing the hunting games that cats really enjoy like chasing and leaping up high if you and your wife are away from the home a lot due to work or other commitments you might want to consider adopting a companion cat as a play mate for him the web site below will give you advice on how to introduce the two of them http www tulsa animalshelter org tips intro cat htm there is a condition known as pica craving for non edible items which is most commonly experienced by pregnant women but cats can suffer from this too keep an eye on your cat to ensure that he doesn't progress from simply chewing to actually eating household items the web article below gives further information on this subject http www vmth ucdavis edu home beh feline behavior pica html i hope these suggestions help good luck  Fancy rat Guinea pig Ferret Garfield Tooth Tobacco Dog training Pet

new kitten help i've always been a dog person so having a new kitten is quite the adventure unlike a dog i'm realizing that she does not understand no how do i train her to stop play biting and not jump on the couch when my husband and i are eating something i'm in much the same position when my kitten gets bitey i grab her by the scruff of the neck and say no and put her aside she's catching on but i think she just gets excited and forgets or maybe doesn't want to remember we're closer to success on the food thing i feed her before we eat so she isn't hungry and then after we are done i give her a sample of what we had now she knows that peas salad and spagetti sauce are not to her taste she doesn't bother us much during meals anymore  Cat Garfield Shaggy dog story Dog training Piccolo Junior Saga Salad Fingers Cuisine of Denmark Fish and chips Futurama (TV series - season 5) Hot dog Little Britain Pok__mon Live!

flea trap question i read that setting up a night light with a bowl of soapy water under it attracts fleas well i tried it last night so i just stuck a small lamp with a flourescent bulb above a bowl of soapy water but this morning there didn't seem to be many if any fleas in it should i invest in some incandescent bulbs or is the whole idea bunk please note my main concern with going with flea bombs and other such treatments is pretty simple that stuff is poison if i can mitigate the problem until i move in sept then the fleas die without the cats and i will take efforts to ensure no fleas come with us so if i can avoid putting poison into my cats' systems and mine it's worth a shot it works with an aluminum pan like a pie pan  Stage lighting Headlight Ultraviolet Fluorescent lamp Bicycle lighting Traffic light Lighting Photometry (optics) Red Hot Chili Peppers Thomas Edison Cookware and bakeware Color temperature Kakapo Vacuum tube Second Battle of the Atlantic Railway signal Dimmer Tiny Toon Adventures Tobacco Minor Discworld characters Sewage treatment Compact fluorescent lamp Street light Linked list Light-emitting diode Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Bong Electrodeless lamp Discworld gods Laser Manila Rotor machine Risk management Suicide Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Emergency preparedness X10 (industry standard) Christmas lights Nernst lamp Chinchilla Hand grenade Land mine Carburetor Cruising (maritime) Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Neon lamp Arc lamp Spidey Super Stories Flea Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Future energy development Loki CPU cache Cat Carnivorous plant John Frusciante Mach kernel Toilet-related injury Convair B-36 Garlic Light pollution Security lighting Team America: World Police Pet skunk She Loves You Nuclear physics Hamster Bat EastEnders National Football League Hydroelectricity Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Beetle Mercury-vapor lamp USS Tunny (SS-282) Fancy rat Alexander Nikolayevich Lodygin Shrek 2 Night (book) P-38 Lightning Aluminium Flea market Fire fighting The Amber Spyglass Extreme Programming Flashlight Glossary of American football Cube (film) Cannabis cultivation Gypsy moth Mercury (element) San Jose, California Flush toilet Nuclear power Light Transformer Battle of the beams Nuclear fallout Paris Hilton

is it possible to catch a cold from a cat before you call me stupid i read once somewhere that it was possible but i don't know how true it is both my cats have had terrible colds and now i think i'm starting to get it is it possible i caught it from them zoonotic diseases are ones that can be passed from animals to man most diseases are species specific humans don't catch cat flu despite urban legends to the contrary most zoonotic diseases can be avoided through good hygiene disinfecting areas which have become contaminated washing hands after handling contaminated items including cats and wearing rubber gloves to prevent infectious matter entering skin wounds the majority of diseases pose no threat to humans and can be treated by your doctor a few are more dangerous to those with poor immune systems and a very small minority are unquestionably dangerous e g rabies the web article provides lots of information about any possible health risks to humans from cats http www messybeast com zoonoses htm  Zoonosis Foodborne illness Rabies Cat Avian influenza AIDS Tattoo Influenza pandemic Tuberculosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma HIV Immune system Malaria OPV AIDS hypothesis National Institutes of Health Cytomegalovirus Vitamin C Rocky Mountain spotted fever Toxoplasmosis Bat Ebola Wound Surveillance Duesberg hypothesis Livestock Louis Pasteur Chagas disease Leprosy Allergy Borna disease Glove Thimerosal Vaccine Herpes simplex virus Infectious disease Escherichia coli O157:H7 Dog Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Medicine Bleeding Pneumonia First aid Blood transfusion Spanish flu Prostate cancer Cancer Hematophagy Asthma Transmission (medicine) Anthrax Hepatitis C Mosquito Food Leptospirosis Pollution Tick Methamphetamine Sewage treatment Medical analysis of circumcision HIV test Psoriasis Pet skunk Bubonic plague Smallpox Crohn's disease Baylisascaris Natural Hygiene Decontamination Stem cell Pandemic Human sexual behavior Raw food diet Cryptosporidium Schistosomiasis Hiking Hamster Bacteria Diarrhea Ascariasis Environmental engineering Biological warfare Public health in mainland China Anorexia nervosa Myxobolus cerebralis Ehrlichiosis Epidemiology Echovirus Tocopherol Feral cat Disinfection Shrimp farm

my friend took in a momma cat with kittens the kits are wks and momma was put down with fel leukemia dy i had my heart set on one kitten and they all seem happy and frisky but so did mom i'm confused by the on line info about cat lukaemia some info says the kittens may be fine but other info makes it sound like all cats should be sick i have other cats and would never want to expose them unknowingly should we bother having the kitten tested or should my friend have the whole litter put down this is heart wrenching and confusing has anyone else had this experience i would love some thoughts here is a statement so not all cats will be exposed from the mother if that is the source felv usually spreads through infected saliva it can also spread through infected urine tears and feces and through an infected mother to her kittens during gestation and nursing twenty percent of felv positive mothers pass the virus to their kittens methods of transmission include the following bite wounds from infected cats more common among outdoor and indoor outdoor cats blood transfusions mouth and nose contact with infected saliva or urine mutual grooming nose to nose contact shared food dishes and water bowls shared litter trays sneezing and here is another statement and the link is the second one in the source i just discovered that one of my cats has felv yet i have other cats as well what should i do unfortunately many felv infected cats are not diagnosed until after they have lived with other cats in such cases all other cats in the household should be tested for felv ideally infected and non infected cats should then be separated to eliminate the potential for felv transmission in other words test all the kittens some may not have it since only of mothers will give it to their kittens separate the kittens that have it  Cat Feline leukemia virus Cytomegalovirus Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS H5N1 Hepatitis C Rabies Kitten Tuberculosis Transmission (medicine) Ebola Common cold Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pneumonia Urinary incontinence Ferret Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Pet skunk Group A streptococcal infection Lassa fever Escherichia coli O157:H7 Safe sex Hamster Elephant Prostate cancer HIV test Body piercing Chagas disease Tobacco smoking Feline immunodeficiency virus Meme Diabetes mellitus Computer virus Entamoeba histolytica 2005 dengue outbreak in Singapore Gonorrhoea Diseases of the honeybee HIV Sexually-transmitted infection Cocaine First aid Blood transfusion Tick AIDS reappraisal Herpes simplex virus Hepatitis B Malaria Marburg virus Breastfeeding 28 Days Later Chinchilla Toilet humour Cancer Obstetrics AIDS pandemic Socialization Dog Poliomyelitis Hepatitis Medicine Rocky Mountain spotted fever Fertility awareness Human T-lymphotropic virus Coeliac disease Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Housebreaking RuneScape quests Toxoplasmosis Measles Traumatic brain injury Avian influenza Leptospirosis DDT Allergy Fancy rat Parvovirus B19 Anemia Manx (cat) Smallpox Intravenous therapy Leukemia AIDS Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy Feral cat Joy Division (band) Lupus erythematosus Cephalic disorder Ultraviolet Infectious mononucleosis Urine Sluggy Freelance Phoebe Buffay's songs Vulcan (Star Trek)

kitty is sleeping alot and not eating much what is wrong with her our kitten's behavior pretty much changed over night from being a hyper car mornings evenings our kitten is sleeping in the morning and in the evenings and not eating that much not sure what she does during the day we're at work she's not interested in playing that much anymore she poops and pees regularly she just seems very tired i'm worried only a veterinary examination can determine the true cause of your kitten's behavior changes if she is catching mice and eating them during the day she will not be hungry in the evenings but that might not be so good if the mice were full of poisons most kittens however are playful when their owners are around a veterinary visit would certainly be in order best wishes  Garfield Cat Kitten Guinea pig Toilet humour Fasting Insomnia Cats (musical) Thermoregulation Fancy rat Vladimir Peter Tytla Breakfast Pitaten EastEnders Jam (TV series) Kodocha Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Mickey Mouse Works The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sleep Atomic Kitten Ron and Fez Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography House Mouse Sukkot Dean Koontz Avenue Q Bonnie and Clyde Shrek 2 Weather lore Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Spidey Super Stories Futari wa Pretty Cure WNNX (FM) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an My Name Is Earl Ferret Cuteness Evil reptilian kitten-eater from another planet Frog Soap opera Manx (cat) Full Metal Panic?

how to attract a stray cat i have a cat which is currently years old and i came home late last night and saw him playing with a stray cat i tried to approach him and the other cat but the other cat was scared and ran away what is the best way to get the stray to accept me and possibly let me get close to him her and would it be possible to use my cat as help since the stray isnt bothered by my cat leave some food out for it and maybe something with your scent on it if you see it stand at a distance for a little while to let it get used to you slowly approach it in a non threatening way if scares away back away and start over have some food with you to lure it to you it might take a while if it has been running wild for a while  Cat Animal communication Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dog Pittsburgh Steelers Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Leopard Kakapo Hedgehog Feral Cats (musical) Silent Night, Deadly Night Stray Cats American Black Bear Brown Bear Chicago Cubs Maison Ikkoku Lady and the Tramp Lion Feral cat Falconry Hersheypark Cheetah Domestication Fancy rat Taikyoku shogi The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents Trailer Park Boys Tom and Jerry (MGM) Alley Cat Glossary of nautical terms Felidae Skunk Baseball Stars Albatross Pok__mon Live!

couple cat questions i need to get my cat fixed and we are going to get her de clawed how old does she need to be to get fixed and other than her not having claws can being de clawed affect her negatively she is a strictly indoor cat she is only about weeks old in the case of this cat she cant get much more of an attitude she already claws people if they dont pet her the cat has to be at least lbs to be neutered but most vets want to wait till months before they neuter them you can discuss the pros and cons with your vet you deffinatly want to do it before he reaches sexual maturity because he will start spraying and once he starts doing that even neutering isn't a guarentee that he will stop getting him neutered before he starts spraying is pretty much guarentee he won't start spraying i would not recomend declawing i'm sure others have told you the horrors of it so i won't go into that but i must tell you that i work at an animal shelter and we have cats there that their owners two different people surrendered their declawed cats to us because they couldn't handle their behavioral problems that had started after this procedure they don't have claws so they bite and are very ill mannered i've gotten bit by them a few times cleaning their cages and trying to give them fresh food and water other behavioral problem is not using the litterbox litter hurts their feet after surgery so they associate litter box with pain so they didn't use the litter box their owners didn't want to bother to work with them so they declawed them and then didn't want to deal with the other problems that came about so they gave them up there are lots of things you can do to try and correct the scratching problem you may neeed to get a few scratch posts have different materials for scratch posts carpet wood rope cardboard etc we have cats and scratch posts and a cat tree and this is in a bedroom apartment you can get soft claws they are plastic caps that go over your cats claws keep your cats nails trimmed here is a good video of how you can do that http www felinevideos vet cornell edu index shtml please do all you can to not declaw your cat work with your cat teach him right from wrong talk to your vet and see if they have any ideas on what you can do also  Pet skunk Ferret Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Hamster Fancy rat Dog Garfield Socialization Theory of conduct Veterinarian Docking Kitten Milton H.

what's the best way to get rid of fleas have cats hello i have two cats and they as well as my house are infested with fleas it's gotten worse this week as it's been really hot and humid here and i think the fleas are reproducing in the carpets upholstered furniture we've been vacuuming we've given the cats flea baths and the gel stuff that you put on the back of their neck and it's supposed to last a month neither has worked at all it seems i've heard that vacuuming with salt helps what should i do to get them out are flea collars the best for cats thanks for your suggestions so far i'd rather not use a flea bomb for the house because we have a lot of fish in huge tanks and i'd be nervous even with covering them up it does take time to work i gave poppy advantage about weeks ago and up until monday i was still seeing the occasional flea yesterday there was nothing don't bother with flea collars treat the cat go to your vet and get either advantage or frontline plus i went with advantage get yourself a flea comb and comb your cat at least once per day have a bucket with dish soap in it handy to dunk the comb in and to collect the hair fleas can't jump out of the slippery soap no point in combing them out only to have them jump back on your cat flush this down the toilet pour it down the sink or dispose of it away from your house treat your house options are a borate powder product or something that uses diatomaceous earth fleabusters bp fleago natural flea control bp or flea away natural flea powder de put about a tablespoon of this in your vacuum cleaner bag or you can cut up a flea collar to put in there just follow the directions which will vary by product but in general you'll sprinkle on the carpet and vacuum up and also sprinkle into cracks and crevices i chose fleago because it's less expensive than fleabusters i may also try flea away in time vacuum as often as possible before vacuuming stomp around the house this will bring the fleas to life because they'll think there's a tasty morsel out there then vacuum those little bastards up be sure to use your attachments to vacuum as many cracks and crevices as you can they love to hide out there wash any pet bedding in hot water and you'll want to be particularly diligent about vacuuming treating areas where your cat hangs out treat your yard even if your cat doesn't go outside fleas may enter your home if they exist in your yard there's a small chance that you or others may bring fleas in the house with you although this is unlikely get hold of some nematodes to spray in your yard i believe you only have to do this once per year these little creatures will eat the flea larva as one website put it these critters are too small to hug but they deserve it i had to order this online i wasn't able to find a place that sells them in my area and didn't feel like calling every place in the phonebook things not to do don't use any essential oils on your cat particularly anything with pennyroyal or eucalyptus they're toxic to cats don't use flea collars don't give your cat any garlic yeast formulations don't give your cat lemon baths you're going to want to continue treating your home as directed whether that be sprinkling once per week or once a month continue treating throughout flea season when it's warm you can stop during the winter months but start up again in the spring you'll nip them in the bud the key is to treat the environment not the cat if you do that you may never have to apply another flea product directly on them again  Flea Diseases of the honeybee Sento Hamster Bedbug Upholstery Dairy Japanese tea ceremony Sin City Brewery Coffee Plastic Cat Tea Autonomous building Theory of conduct RuneScape quests Solar power Dilbert Thermal power station Garfield Mattress Dog training Menstrual cup Piccolo Junior Saga Equine conformation Blood (computer game) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tick Tofu Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Textile manufacturing The Amber Spyglass EastEnders Siphon Professional wrestling match types Shaggy dog story 613 mitzvot Sauna Chicken Guinea pig 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Dalek Invasion of Earth Soap opera Dry cleaning Toilet Carburetor Mosquito Richard Chase Tobacco Vampire Madonna (entertainer) Tattoo Shark Pebble bed reactor Cruising (maritime) Little Britain Water Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pet skunk Spidey Super Stories Chinchilla Fancy rat Menstrual cycle Gypsy moth Casting Satchel Paige Cuisine of Denmark Futurama (TV series - season 2) Kitchen Chocolate Kakapo I Want to Hold Your Hand Bulk vending Ranma __ characters Sea-Monkey Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Urinary incontinence Jewish cuisine Eucalyptus Manual transmission Ecco the Dolphin Common cold Fox hunting

how do i get my cat to eat other food when he will only eat his current food and refuses everything else my cat is allergic to his current food we recently found out but he refuses to eat anything else he has licked his belly bare but would starve before eating anything else other than tuna he is epileptic and has to take phenobarbital to stop seizures i have tried just putting other food down and making him eat that when he final is hungry enough but he will seriously starve himself before eating anything else i can't believe you people saying cats won't starve themselves that is so wrong cats will starve themselves dogs won't more importantly you vet people should be ashamed for leaving this out if a cat stops eating it can start to develop fatty liver within two days or less this can be very dangerous my cat is having a similar problem with food allergies fortunately she likes everything but when i've tried to switch her quickly her system goes haywire you have to switch gradually put about of the new food in with the old and wait a few days then increase the new food to about of the total you feed etc until you've made a full switch i'm not sure what you are feeding now but one very high quality food that cats have trouble refusing is wellness salmon dry food it is very stinky cats love stinky and it is a very high quality food without fillers or grains which is the main cause of allergies in cats wellness also has a regular food not salmon that would be just as good if you cat can't have the fish keep your cat eating that is the most important thing research the effects on a cat's body if it doesn't eat damage can start happening within as little as a day good luck to you if you have any questions feel free to email me directly i don't work for a vet but i've been researching cat food and diets for two years because of various health problems my cats have  Omega-3 fatty acid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cat Salmon Nutrition Fancy rat Fecal incontinence Oily fish Guinea pig Stomach cancer Garfield Coeliac disease Peanut Anorexia nervosa Allergy Chocolate Taboo food and drink Insulin Folic acid Ferret Tlingit Hypoglycemia Veganism Diabetes mellitus Vegetarianism Dog Binge eating disorder Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Breastfeeding Raw food diet Eating disorder Livestock Fasting Tooth enamel Healthy eating Sushi Tofu Agriculture Atkins Nutritional Approach Welding Hay fever Aspartame Domestication Gas metal arc welding Clomipramine Organic farming Famine Medicine Obesity Whaling Tocopherol Seabird Arguments for and against drug prohibition Chicken Brown Bear Hamster Milk Dieting Hedgehog Protein Eczema Environmental vegetarianism Rabies Super Size Me Haloperidol Trailer Park Boys Cheese Orca Soybean Genetically modified food Food guide pyramid Foie gras Domestic rabbit Vitamin D Carnivore Shaggy dog story Ramen Ecology Kitten 613 mitzvot Vegetarian nutrition 2000 Australian Grand Prix Gray Wolf RuneScape quests Krill Stone Age Coronary heart disease

bitten by a cat while cleaning cages yesterday for a shelter i volunteer one little kitten took a chunk out of my thumb i have never been bit to this degree most cats will scratch and give little warning nips but that is it anyway the bite didn't require stitches but i was told i should go to the dr for a tetanus shot and antibiotics is this true the cat is up to date on all her shots the fact that the cat is healthy from cat diseases is irrelevant to the possibility of your wound getting infected or the possibility of bacteria like tetanus getting through the chance that something like that will actually happen is very small even minimal but the correct approach is to take all precautions and these are indeed to take a tetanus shot and antibiotics for days and since you work at the shelter you must be vaccinated for tetanus so that you don't have to get a shot every time personally i have been bitten many times and never bothered to do all these shots and antibiotics but i know that doctors say that you should anyway make sure you disinfect the wound well  Tetanus Vaccine Rabies Group A streptococcal infection Infectious disease Wound Pneumonia Cat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Anthrax Antibiotic Ferret Pet skunk Old wives' tale Psoriasis Chronic fatigue syndrome Quarantine Feral cat Bacteria Disinfection Guinea pig Rocky Mountain spotted fever Legionellosis Smallpox Escherichia coli O157:H7 Common cold Toxoplasmosis Bubonic plague Acne Staphylococcus aureus Dog Cytomegalovirus Cellulitis RuneScape quests Marburg virus Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Thimerosal Fancy rat Cystic fibrosis Hamster Epidemiology Tularemia Milton H.

my cat has an ear tumor what is the cause of this and how should i treat it my cat's ears have bothered her for a long time we always thought she had ear mites and treated her for that but it never seemed to help much they recently got a lot worse so i took her to the vet he said that she had a tumor in her ear he said that he has saw this in many cats and that most usually he removes the tumor and it just comes back then soon after the cat dies we had the tumor removed this time he said if it comes back he would suggest putting her to sleep i have an ear ointment to put in the cats ears everyday which is very hard to do to make me even more confused the vet tells me this he said his cousin had a tumor in his ear and went through major surgerys and had his ear removed the dr's said he had herpes and that is what cause the tumor the vet said he thought that this may be what could caused the tumors in the ears of so many cats i am soo confused anyone that knows any info about this or has experienced this please help thank you i agree with marlou you need to go to another vet this whole thing is weird i have never heard of a cat having to be put down for a tumor in the ear it seems to be a localized condition the vet that you have seems confused himself go seek a second opinion oh was the tumor cancerous maybe he is concerned that the cancer will spread in the body of your cat now if that is the case then i could see why your vet would suggest that alternative otherwise i cannot rationalize why you would need to have your kitty put to rest as for putting drops in your kitty's ears i would suggest finding someone to help that person can hold the kitty by the scruff the back of the neck and the back legs firmly while you administer the drops that is what we do when we give our cat s drips or cut his nails good luck and i hope everything turns out well for you and your beloved pet  Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Lung cancer Cancer Metastasis Radiation therapy Colorectal cancer Ferret Breast cancer Urinary incontinence Dog Brain tumor Cancer of the larynx Epilepsy Garfield Chronic fatigue syndrome Malignant melanoma Soft tissue sarcoma Guinea pig Cat Fancy rat Rabies Mesothelioma Traumatic brain injury Esophageal cancer Hearing impairment Testicular cancer Babe Ruth Medicine Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Oncology Care Bears 2000 Australian Grand Prix Prolactinoma Shaggy dog story Alcoholics Anonymous Book of Isaiah Paget's disease of bone Domestic rabbit Syringomyelia Neurofibromatosis type II Bell's palsy Acromegaly Stem cell The Dalek Invasion of Earth Milton H.

how do i get rid of fleas once and for all my cat has fleas not only are they torturing her but they are all over my house yesterday i took her to the vet for a flea dip they also gave me a frontline collar that i can't put on her for a couple of days while she was out we fogged every room in the house we've been vacuuming like crazy and spraying cracks and in and under furniture and bedding however i am afraid that my cat still has some clinging to her and the cycle will begin once again what can i do to stop this everything i've read says it's nearly impossible to rid yourself of fleas and it is an on going process is there anyway to end it once and for all thanks all of you were very helpful it is an ongoing process but once you rid your cat and home of live fleas you can go into maintenance mode and should be able to prevent future outbreaks treat the cat go to your vet and get either advantage or frontline plus i went with advantage get yourself a flea comb and comb your cat at least once per day have a bucket with dish soap in it handy to dunk the comb in and to collect the hair fleas can't jump out of the slippery soap no point in combing them out only to have them jump back on your cat flush this down the toilet pour it down the sink or dispose of it away from your house treat your house options are a borate powder product or something that uses diatomaceous earth fleabusters bp fleago natural flea control bp or flea away natural flea powder de put about a tablespoon of this in your vacuum cleaner bag or you can cut up a flea collar to put in there just follow the directions which will vary by product but in general you'll sprinkle on the carpet and vacuum up and also sprinkle into cracks and crevices i chose fleago because it's less expensive than fleabusters i may also try flea away in time vacuum as often as possible before vacuuming stomp around the house this will bring the fleas to life because they'll think there's a tasty morsel out there then vacuum those little bastards up be sure to use your attachments to vacuum as many cracks and crevices as you can they love to hide out there wash any pet bedding in hot water and you'll want to be particularly diligent about vacuuming treating areas where your cat hangs out treat your yard even if your cat doesn't go outside fleas may enter your home if they exist in your yard there's a small chance that you or others may bring fleas in the house with you although this is unlikely get hold of some nematodes to spray in your yard i believe you only have to do this once per year these little creatures will eat the flea larva as one website put it these critters are too small to hug but they deserve it i had to order this online i wasn't able to find a place that sells them in my area and didn't feel like calling every place in the phonebook things not to do don't use any essential oils on your cat particularly anything with pennyroyal or eucalyptus they're toxic to cats don't use flea collars don't give your cat any garlic yeast formulations don't give your cat lemon baths you're going to want to continue treating your home as directed whether that be sprinkling once per week or once a month continue treating throughout flea season when it's warm you can stop during the winter months but start up again in the spring you'll nip them in the bud the key is to treat the environment not the cat if you do that you may never have to apply another flea product directly on them again  Flea Diseases of the honeybee Coffee Bedbug Brewery Sento Upholstery Bread Cat Japanese toilet Dairy Sewage treatment Hamster Thermal power station Japanese tea ceremony Menstrual cup Autonomous building Tea Customs and etiquette of Japan Theory of conduct Equine conformation Siphon Red Hot Chili Peppers Textile manufacturing Casting Soap Solar power Vacuum cleaner Sin City Manual transmission Dry cleaning Kitchen Chicken Fecal incontinence Pebble bed reactor Mattress Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tobacco Blood (computer game) The Amber Spyglass Carburetor Baptism RuneScape quests Tick Soap opera Mosquito Illegal drug trade John Frusciante Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Fancy rat Genericized trademark Welding Dog training Chinchilla Richard Chase Dilbert Animal Crossing Guinea pig Nuclear power City of Heroes Ecco the Dolphin Cuisine of Denmark Menstrual cycle Shaggy dog story Pet skunk Energy development Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Toilet Professional wrestling match types Vacuum USS Vestal (AR-4) Electrophysiology M16 (rifle) Water Ranma __ characters Charmed Bulk vending Linked list The Dalek Invasion of Earth Fire fighting Spidey Super Stories Tofu Characters in the Smurfs Shampoo Sulfur Knots Landing Satchel Paige Instant coffee Lumber Philosophy of space and time Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Electric motor 2000 Australian Grand Prix

my friend is househunting he has a year old with ibd that is controlled for the most part with prednisone he is concerned that the move will cause the ibd to act up also his cat has been pooing in the kitchen sink since his problem with ibd began we all assume that is because he thought the cat box was causing his discomfort no one knows where he will go when he gets to the new house my friend is hoping he will adopt the new kitchen sink instead of a place on the floor it's a year old cat yeah everyone thinks it's pretty gross but he just won't use the cat box making coffee at his house can be pretty gross this may turn out even better than using the new sink have your friend buy a new litter box and a completely different type of litter than before the kitty might start using it as everything is new house box and litter your friend might also be able to train the cat to use the human toilet many people have done it the cat is already halfway there with pooping on a solid surface http www karawynn net mishacat toilet html good luck to your friend and her kitty purrs the cat lady  Cat Cat litter Domestic rabbit Kitten Hamster Carolina Panthers Poker jargon Pitaten Toilet humour Ren and Stimpy Shit Fecal incontinence Catscratch Inflammatory bowel disease Kitchen 2000 Australian Grand Prix Shaggy dog story Nicomachean Ethics Sailing Animal communication Japanese toilet Conker's Bad Fur Day Toilet Ulcerative colitis Eight ball Jackass: The Movie Steven Wright Composting toilet Phoebe Buffay Urinary incontinence Friends Cliff Richard Badly Drawn Kitties Hello Kitty Garfield Upstairs, Downstairs Washroom The Amazing Race Radio Telef__s __ireann Kill Bill Pride and Prejudice Prisons in the United States Felix the Cat Jean Grey Passenger car Maneki Neko About a Boy Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Luck Cats (musical) Sewage treatment HTML Feral cat Diatomaceous earth Dog Ages of Myst USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) Shadowcat Fancy rat Trainspotting (novel) World Wide Web Social rule RKO Pictures Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh Value added The Ashlee Simpson Show Soap opera Pretty Good Privacy Bristol Grammar School Neko the Kitty Kevin and Kell Gaia Online Little Britain Wood carving Vomiting Uniform Resource Locator Feces The Fairly OddParents Rock Follies Wright brothers Semiconductor device The Brady Bunch HyperText Transfer Protocol HTML element Care Bears Drill bit Hiberno-English Dormitory Purr Cheetah Kimi Finster The Lion King Genericized trademark Infantilism OpenBSD USS Yorktown (CV-5) Xiaolin Showdown First Battle of the Atlantic

i'm having cat issues meet charlie our year old tabby i rescued him from the local shelter he has adapted to us quite well but for some reason he does not want to poo in his litter box i clean it daily and vacuum the area around it regularly too we moved the box when we opened the house to him i showed him several times where it was he urinates fine in the box but seems to defect right in front of the box not inside i do not know what else to do i will try some of the things that i've seen offered with other questions but i'm really concerned that we will have to give him away also yesterday he had some diahrrea sp and it looked as though there may have been some blood discharge is this normal i set up an appointment with the vet but she didn't seem concerned is this a sign of worms any advice would be much appreciated should i confine him in the basement with the box so he can get used to it did i give him free reign too soon thanks i just want to say that giving up charlie is not an option i just stated that i didn't want it to come to that so please keep your judgement to yourself i would never give my daughter up but this is where the problem lies i do not want any harm to come from this issue i e my daughter thinking this is some kind of food so back off you do not know the entire situation and you do not know what kind of animal lover i am so your judgement is not necessary thank you i think the changing food and changing litter are two good recommendations plus here are my two cents i had a cat that had all sorts of bathroom issues until i took him off canned food he happily ate dry food the rest of his life and never another problem another cat i had seemed to think that if his front legs were in the box then his back legs were too we got a bigger litter box and he was fine a friend of mine with the same problem ended up using one of those under the bed rubbermaid things like 'x ' as a litter box and that was when her problems finally ended she slowly weaned him down to a smaller box finally until your issues end get some heavy plastic sheeting from home depot or somewhere and cut a piece to lay under the box that extends out a couple feet anywhere the kitty might poo i'd try everyone's suggestions before you rush to the vet when an issue is vague the vets seem to charge more they do test after test they'll do anything that you authorize them too i've had to say no to a kitty cat scan twice and he got better on his own anyway good luck  Hamster Cat Fancy rat Pet skunk Garfield Domestic rabbit Kitten Guinea pig Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Poker jargon Dog Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Basement Contract Urinary incontinence Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Mattress Pitaten The Shining (film) Ferret Sin City Theory of conduct Cat litter Waste management Peanuts Animal rights Pretty Good Privacy The Amazing Race Folic acid Equine conformation Dairy 613 mitzvot Plame affair Prostate cancer Terri Schiavo EastEnders Kitchen Knife Soap opera Jumpstart 3rd Grade Breastfeeding Fecal incontinence Friends Salad Fingers Textile manufacturing Long Path Genericized trademark Blood on the Tracks Heinkel He 100 Ecco the Dolphin Ron and Fez Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mercury Cougar Chicken Vitamin C Combine (Half-Life 2) Cascading Style Sheets The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Kashrut George W.

hurt feral cat i've just got in from work and noticed one of the old feral cats that hang around my garden is not well he is in the same position as he was when i left early this morning i went to have a look at him and i think he might have a broken paw only trouble is he won't let me near him and if i scare him and he goes off he might not get back and i would really like to get him to the vet suggestions on catching him please he is a wild cat and not at all friendly the dspca will just put him to sleep as he is wild he's been living here years and i feed him every day and would rather bring him to our vet tough one you could easily be injured while trying to help him so procede with extreme caution first put food out for him you may need to feed him a couple of times before he will let you approach him secondly use a small blanket or thick towel and place him a carrier this is more easily done by placing the back end in first if you still have no luck call your local animal shelter try to find one that is a no kill shelter as many cities simply destroy feral cats  Cat Dog Feral Ferret Feral cat Socialization Pittsburgh Steelers Guinea pig Feral child Tenshinhan Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Waking the Dragons Domestication Gray Wolf Animal euthanasia American Black Bear Hunting Norwegian Campaign Hamster Feral cat colony Imperial Guard (Warhammer 40,000 army) Brown Bear Tom and Jerry (MGM) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Domestic rabbit The Dalek Invasion of Earth Cleveland Browns Wild Cat Shaggy dog story Conker's Bad Fur Day Pitaten Tiger Introduced species Microchip implant (animal) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Cheetah Comanche The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe RuneScape quests Maneki Neko Cannabis cultivation Cowboy Bebop Battle of Tarawa StarCraft Secret Missions Oh My Goddess!

i ahave a young cat a tortie and my seven year mentally retareded sister comes over to pet her the cat will appear to be enjoying herself then suddely jump up and scratch the poor girl in the face one time she scratched her eyelid the girl is still allowed to pet her but only once or twice then she has to stop why does kitty flip out like that uh staight down the line inever said she was rough with her i think your the ding bat the two are always closely supervised actually the cat is healthy as a horse except for having half solid half soft stools occasionally and she's going to the vet this am for a shot to clear that up good anawer susan w you too matt c the cat never freaks out on me but she does have a limit for petting i have had my sister to pet my arm like she's petting the cat and the petting doesn't seems like it's too much pressure but it could be for the cat normally the cat appears to be glad to see her and approaches her for a pet and even flops on her side for more pets to avoid future attacks she has to stop petting after about thirty seconds so far that has worked well also she's not allowed to lean in close anymore getting some really good answers thanks my brother's young lab that is scared of everybody and his own shadow will follow her around for hours torties can be difficult cats i have two now and have owned others in the past none of them have been ones to like being petted the older one i have now used to lie on her back and invite to have you rub her tummy she would then nip your hand the younger one does not like being stroked at all but likes to be around and to sleep on the bed with me or my daughter one i had when my eldest now was little and she would strike out for no reason as for your sister being rough i doubt that very much specially as she would be supervised intellectually disabled people and animals have a special bond and the animals are usually very gentle i honestly believe it is the cat and not your sister hopefully as your cat gets older and matures she will mellow next time the cat misbehaves put her in time out then let her out after a while usually this will help to modify the behavior  Ranma __ characters Dog Azumanga Daioh Guinea pig Volleyball Hamster Sin City Fancy rat 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Professional wrestling holds Aerial (dance move) Tenchi Muyo!

what the hell happened to this cat ok so i got back from a day trip and walk into the house my brother goes and finds the cat and brings it upstairs he sets the cat down and it walks off to do whatever it was gonna do a minute later we hear the cat crying louder than i've ever heard it cry so we run over to see what happened and the cat is just laying on the ground with it's mouth open panting and crying we couldn't figure out was wrong with it we checked it's feet legs mouth everything it was lying on the ground for about seconds until it finally got up slowly and walked away it's been acting completely normal ever since then and i have no idea what had happened to it my only explanation is that it may have chewed on a wire and got shocked from it but i checked all the wires where it was laying and none of them were exposed and none have bite marks what the hell happened to this cat i thought the cat was gonna die for sure by the way it was crying it's been a week since this happened and the cat has been acting like this never happened i'm guessing it had a seizure because that is the only explanation that makes sense the cat didn't get hit with anything step on anything eat anything or jump off of anything weird shit also it's mouth was open the whole time it was on the ground it was like it was paralyzed and freaking out but couldn't move don't know if that helps actually you were right when you said your cat had a seizure seizures can happen any time any where some animals make noise while other's don't keep an eye on your cat if it continues to have seizures call the vet he'll probably prescribe meds your cat can to take there isn't much you can do for your cat when it's have a seizure but to protect it from hurting it's self be sure to use caution too they are not aware of what his happening to them some animals will thrash around and you could get bit or scratched there's nothing wrong with holding them but again use caution some animals will be very tired after having a seizure and will want to sleep let your cat sleep as long as it wants to your cat will be just fine good luck and don't panic  Ferret Piccolo Junior Saga Pitaten Cat The Shining (film) Out-of-body experience Milton H.

my cat has a lump on her back i have a year old cat who seemingly overnight has developed a medium sized blob type lump under her skin behind her right shoulder it felt warm to the touch and moved pretty freely under the skin she went to the vet a week ago for her annual checkup and got some vaccines however she has never had an allergic reaction before so i doubt it is that the blob moving under her skin doesn't seem to cause her any pain she doesn't flinch or make any kind of protest to touch and she is walking normally she has lost a pound and a half in the past year and is in general good health i'm worried has anyone else experienced this i'm taking her to the vet tomorrow regardless i think last friday when she was at the vet she got her year rabies shot i heard that they can cause bad abcesses at the injection site sometimes has anyone had experience with this hmm given her age i would say its possibly a fatty tumor but that's not necessarily much to worry about they don't usually show up that fast but its possible its been there a while and you overlooked it i'd call your vet and ask their opinion it could also possibly be a cyst but those tend to be a bit firmer to the touch it could also be the site where the cat recieved its vaccines if it was injected in a way that left it suspended rather than fully absorbed call the vet and they'll eliminate a few possiblities for you  Pet skunk Guinea pig Rabies Fancy rat Vaccine Ferret Prostate cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Allergy Hypoglycemia Urinary incontinence Equine conformation Ben Johnson (athlete) Milton H.

is getting a cat's mouth cleaned expensive i recently wondered about my cat's breath he's older apparently it's could be a health problem could anyone tell me a ball park idea of the vet cost at the clinic i'm at it starts at about pre operative blood work is an option for younger animals but usually required for older ones the cost for that blood work can vary depending on what type of panel the vet recommends at my clinic it starts at about and can get up as high as about for an expanded profile if your cat needs extractions those may also be additional it's also possible that he may even need to go home with antibiotics or start them before the procedure depending on how bad his oral health has become and pain medication is another possible expense especially if extractions are necessary at the clinic i'm at the cost is about for most cats your vet may be completely different of course but hopefully this gives you some idea i know it sounds kind of expensive but it's well worth it  Pneumonia Diabetes mellitus Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Veterinarian Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Folic acid Guinea pig Hypoglycemia Pet skunk Cancer Halitosis Domestic rabbit Insulin Multiple sclerosis Nutrition Ferret Tooth enamel Growth hormone treatment Chronic fatigue syndrome Medicine HIV test Drug test Medicare (Canada) Food and Drug Administration Migraine Breast cancer Blood transfusion Colorectal cancer Traditional Chinese medicine Aspartame Acne Asthma Cat Drug addiction Sickle-cell disease Fancy rat Stomach cancer Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Lung cancer Gastroesophageal reflux disease First aid Dentistry Dialysis Clinical depression Cannabis (drug) Myocardial infarction Insurance Breastfeeding Abortion Tuberculosis Physical therapy Physician Paracetamol National Health Service Radiation therapy Oral contraceptive Lethal injection Cardiovascular disease Raw food diet Medical cannabis Education in Australia Medical analysis of circumcision Randomness Pharmaceutical company Shrimp farm International Phonetic Alphabet Aspergillosis Medical school Childbirth Chlorpromazine Ebola Needle aspiration biopsy Tobacco smoking Animal testing Divorce Hypnosis Health insurance Asbestos Tocopherol Atherosclerosis Rabies Microeconomics Stroke Nuclear power Shock Low density lipoprotein Sleep apnea Clomipramine Dental caries Stem cell Computed tomography Positron emission tomography Balance disorder Compiler optimization Mesothelioma Chiropractic Group A streptococcal infection

i have an older cat with terrible breath i don't know if his teeth are rotting or what but he won't eat those little cat mints sadly i don't have the money to take him to the vet for something so minor but does anyone know what i could do to chill the stink you seriously can smell it across the room this is not a minor problem your cat's dental health can actually affect his whole body it's strange but true there is nothing you can do at home suck it up and get your cat in for a proper dental cleaning after the bacteria and plaque have been removed from under his gum line there are treatments you can use at home to help slow the growth of new bacteria and plaque don't wait until your cat is not able to eat or develops a giant painful abscess in his mouth i've seen it happen too often and it's not good for the cat or the cat's owner ignoring this problem now will cost you more later and subtract years from your kitty's life  Dental caries Tooth Tooth enamel Halitosis Oral hygiene Dentistry Domestic rabbit Gingivitis Ferret Oral sex Fancy rat Dental brace Guinea pig Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Traumatic brain injury Fecal incontinence Chronic fatigue syndrome Fluoride therapy Coeliac disease Endocarditis Hydrogen sulfide Raisin Dental floss Foodborne illness Stomach cancer Group A streptococcal infection The Dentist Abscess Garfield AIDS Babe Ruth Bacteria Equine conformation Tuberculosis Toothpaste Psoriasis Common cold Breastfeeding Surgery Mint Multiple sclerosis Decompression sickness Minor Harry Potter Beasts Prostate cancer Richard Chase Medicare (Canada) Medicine Phoebe Buffay's songs Shaggy dog story Pet skunk Diseases of the honeybee Chewing gum Growth hormone treatment Dentures Adolf Hitler's medical health Traditional Chinese medicine First aid Clomipramine Hygiene Gonorrhoea Taboo food and drink Insurance Mesothelioma Fugu Ulcerative colitis Listerine Ragwort Hamster Mosquito Dietary fiber Chocolate Bart chalkboard gags Felis sapiens Diabetes mellitus Bruxism Andr__s Galarraga Methamphetamine Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Nutmeg GunBound Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Raw food diet Odor Burial Rabies Stuttering Malaria Quality of life Escherichia coli O157:H7 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Nutrition Badly Drawn Kitties Skunk Girly Carnivorous plant Tobacco smoking Kenny McCormick Menstrual cup

blood in cats poop theres blood in my cats poop he has always had liquid like stool i figured was just nerves but now theres blood he also has in the last weeks had two sores that could just be the other cat scratching him just like dried scabs but it could be related perhaps with a history of loose stools and now skin problems it sounds like your cat suffers from food allergies this is a battle i also fight with my cat the blood in the stool is from colitis or an inflammed colon what you need to do is to work with your vet to try different foods to help control the problem i say control because an allergy is lifelong and it is up to you to control it your vet may try unique protein foods or even hypoallergenic foods like hills zd or purina ha these foods are designed for cats like yours be patient food allergies can be extremely difficult to deal with and i have noticed with my cat that the older they get the more difficult the problem gets even the condition worsens with age  Diarrhea Allergy Urinary incontinence Stomach cancer Crohn's disease Food allergy Cat Traumatic brain injury Psoriasis Coeliac disease Insulin Gout Ulcerative colitis Colorectal cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ferret Medicine Dietary fiber Ebola Laxative Acne Irritable bowel syndrome Protein Hay fever Multiple sclerosis Diabetes mellitus Breastfeeding Asthma Guinea pig Constipation Growth hormone treatment Tocopherol Folic acid Autoimmune diseases Botulism Dieting Flatulence First aid Tuberculosis Gastroparesis Immunoglobulin E Group A streptococcal infection Clomipramine Gastroesophageal reflux disease Mouth ulcer Fancy rat Clostridium difficile Insomnia Chlorpromazine Common cold Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Sulfasalazine Schistosomiasis Mastocytosis Escherichia coli O157:H7 Migraine Inflammatory bowel disease Porphyria Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Paracetamol M__ni__re___s disease Pulmonary embolism Dog Adjustable gastric band Spina bifida Skin Sickle-cell disease Food Cerebellum Diabetic neuropathy Aspartame Lactose intolerance Hamster Parkinson's disease Anemia Feral cat Growth hormone Latex allergy Feces Cancer Human feces Entamoeba histolytica Bodybuilding Coagulation Raw food diet Domestic rabbit Dandruff Autistic enterocolitis Livestock Cirrhosis Radiation therapy Pain Cholesterol Pet skunk Hemorrhoid

how long should cats be out my dad puts tom my cat out at about oclock and then lets him in about in the morning is this too much and can someone suggest a good timetable otherwise it seems like hes sleeping all day then going out at night not sure if its the right thing to do your cat shouldn't go outside at all there are too many dangers for cats outside they get attacked by predators hit by cars pick up diseases etc a cat who lives inside has a much longer healthier life than a cat who goes outside  Cat Bart the Daredevil Friends Grandview, U.S.A.

why are cats so fluffy i was reading on the wikipedia cats are from the near east that is to say places such as iran iraq turkey israel lebanon syria and so on they were domesticated years ago from desert wildcats so my point is that it is so warm there that fluffiness is not required for their survival i believe domestic cats are also much more colorful than their wild ancestors so could it be cats are so fluffy to give more pleasure to their human masters thereby increasing their sucess as a species what evolutionary advantage would fluffiness be for a cat actually they are fluffy due to the constant breeding and experimental breeding that humans have done to them for thousands of years you know we have bald cats now too huh  Domestication Cat Wild Cat Kakapo Ferret Guinea pig Hybrid Island Fox Palearctic Species Horse Gulf War Lion Camel Domestic rabbit Assyrian people Middle East Feral cat Bengal cat Kurdish people Primate Gray Wolf Tiger Bird migration Cradle of Humanity Biodiversity The Origin of Species Felidae History of the Middle East Arab Kitten Evolution Extinction Domestic sheep Asia Rabbit Rice Global 200 Reproduction Dog show Inception of Darwin's theory Shetland Sheepdog Human skin color Lebanese Civil War Cheetah Tabby cat Leopard History of Islam Feral Lazarus Long Turkish Angora Liger Arab world Livestock Guns, Germs, and Steel Mink Whale Fertile Crescent Religion Daniel Pipes Football World Cup 1990 (qualification) Saddam Hussein Jewish exodus from Arab lands Neolithic Syria War on Terrorism Arab-Israeli conflict Hezbollah The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Maine Coon Domestication of the horse Mediterranean Basin Natufian culture History of the Kurdistan Workers Party Dingo History of Iraq Arab League Black (people) Honeybee Artificial selection Manx (cat) Aurochs Arabian horse Geography of Israel Islamic world Timeline of 20th century Islamic history Lebanon Koala Incirlik Air Base 1948 Arab-Israeli War European Rabbit Demographics of Israel History of Iran Balinese (cat) Land of Israel Domesticated turkey Fauna of Australia Creationism

why does my cat urinate on other cats i have a wonderful cat named gatto that is italian for cat for those of you that have never lifted your head out of your cat's litter box now i love my cat because he keeps me company and everything keeps the nyc rats away now my girlfriend is a pain in the ass and she brings her cat over to play with gatto now they're both males my cat gatto is ehhh a real bull dick you might say for lack of a better term everytime she brings her cat over gatto urinates on the other cat and they start fighting and my girlfriend starts breaking my balls because my cat is being an animal as she puts it when i say all cats are animals she says no just yours but anyway my girlfriend wants to move in now i don't want my cat pissing on the other cat or on anything other than his litterbox for that matter it's not like he pisses on anything other than his litterbox or other cats that he doesn't like how do i train my cat not to piss on his enemies first and foremost you can't train cats if your cat isn't neutered then i suggest you do so that will help the problem tremendously but only if her cat is also males tend to fight with each other more than with females since it is in their natural instinct to what your cat is simply doing is marking his territory neutering usually fixes this problem but not always they aren't used to each other either bringing a new cat into the picture is always negative at first no matter what the gender after they are both neutered if not already done so put them both together regardless of urination deal with it at the moment and give them some time to get used to it i can't guarantee that this will eliminate the problem completely but more than likely it will it varies by cat and attitude unfortunately  Cat Gender-neutral language Gender Feral cat Guinea pig Dog Euphemism Shaggy dog story Kitten Housebreaking Hamster Ranma __ characters Vulgar Latin Pet skunk Toxoplasmosis Doraemon Castration Manx (cat) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Calvin and Hobbes Bulgarian language Ben Johnson (athlete) Eric Cartman German grammar Ron and Fez Something Positive Trainspotting (novel) Theory of conduct Friends The Smoking Room Homeschooling Toilet humour House Mouse Beavis and Butt-head Abstraction Homer Simpson Penis Harem anime Spider-Man Fancy rat Electrophysiology Fruits Basket The Cat in the Hat Weebl and Bob Philosophy of language Toilet Brown Bear Felis sapiens Gender role God and gender Carolina Panthers Fritz the Cat (movie) Non-native pronunciations of English Domestic violence True Crime: Streets of LA Polish language Urination Sinfest The Catcher in the Rye Pok__mon Chronicles Military slang Hybrid Cat litter Spanish nouns YuYu Hakusho Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Territory (animal) Andr__s Galarraga Urinary incontinence Procrastination Animal communication Ranma Saotome Cheshire cat Ren and Stimpy Anne Rice Diving Piccolo (Dragon Ball) The Death Gate Cycle Sin City Friendship Old French Kyle Broflovski Leopard Professional wrestling slang Gender identity Dualism (philosophy of mind) Atheism Peanuts Pitaten Prolog Kim Possible Tenshinhan FLCL Esperanto as an international language RuneScape quests

do cats just capture a bird to show off i have seen remnants of birds so i suspect that some cats eat birds when they are very hungry it may be that some birds simply don't taste as good as others or that some cats catch birds but do not understand that birds are edible they may kill but not ingest i have found that cats are picky picky picky about rodents they will chase just about anything and will kill sometimes but they will only eat some of them  Cat Eating Caracal Wile E.

my cat is sick he's an indoor cat has gotten all the necessary shots and vet visits he's about or years old he's got a pretty healthy coat and he eats well he's been acting normal and we don't believe that he has lost any weight today we noticed he had a red lesion on his back it was oozing a bit and was inflamed we really don't think it's ringworm because ringworm tends to be dry and flaky he has a history of health problems however mostly bladder infections he also had a severe kidney infection before but it didn't do any damage he's on antibiotics permanently due to his kidney infection to prevent a future occurrence we're worried that the lesion may be a sign of cancer he's going to the vet tomorrow any ideas or help any lesion or lump is a cause for concern i'm glad you're taking him to the vet so you can find out what it is and get the proper treatment he's quite young for it to be cancer and in cats most cancer is internal rather than on the surface of the body so i don't think that's the most likely diagnosis let us know what happens  Fancy rat Cancer Psoriasis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Group A streptococcal infection Eczema Urinary incontinence Folic acid Pneumonia Diarrhea Diabetes mellitus Cirrhosis Radiation therapy Herpes simplex virus Domestic rabbit Hypertension Multiple sclerosis Lupus erythematosus Kaposi's sarcoma First aid Acne Rabies Tuberculosis Cervical cancer Guinea pig Ringworm Anemia Malaria Malignant melanoma Ferret Stomach cancer Decompression sickness Ovarian cancer Nephrology Schistosomiasis Medical analysis of circumcision Mesothelioma Tobacco smoking Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cephalic disorder Endocarditis Chemotherapy Myxobolus cerebralis Turner syndrome AIDS Chronic fatigue syndrome Spina bifida Dialysis Sickle-cell disease Ulcerative colitis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Crohn's disease Medicine Colorectal cancer Lung cancer Coeliac disease Diabetic nephropathy Common cold Circumcision Asthma Endometriosis Obesity Breast cancer Urinary tract infection Brain tumor Radiation poisoning Rocky Mountain spotted fever Conjunctivitis Heartworm Public health Dermatology Insulin Breastfeeding Coma Traumatic brain injury Tasmanian Devil Gonorrhoea Syphilis Stroke Tooth enamel Chlorpromazine Goodpasture's syndrome Anthrax Cat Lyme disease Sleeping sickness Kidney Health insurance Hepatitis Traditional Chinese medicine Manx (cat) H5N1 Aspergillosis Blood

how do i get my cat to stop urinating outside her litter box my female cat is three years old soon to be four and i can't get her to stop urinating outside her litter box it is cleaned several times a week i've tried cleaning up around the box so she doesn't have any kicked out litter to go on and i've gotten her a new different litter box to go in that is taller so she can't kick litter out but she still goes outside her box i have also had her checked for urinary problems and she had a clean bill of health we recently moved into a new apartment and i was hopeful that with a change in the location of the box maybe she wouldn't anymore but when we came home today she had peed on the mat i have sitting under the litter box she seems to just want to pee right next to the box instead of in it i don't know how to correct this behavior i don't want to give her up since i have had her since she was about five months old but i can't keep her if she is going to continue peeing on the floor any help would be greatly appreciated kay first of all put lots of news paper underneath the litter box covering the areas where she would urinate if you see her urinate outside say loudly and firmly to her no and place her inside the litterbox straight away if she comes to you for attention after don't give it let her know that you do not like what she's doing this is pointless if you don't do it straight away if she does use it pet her a lot and give her some treats afterwards d make a big fuss of her preferably straight away my cats used to have a serious problem doing this but at least yours does it next to the box so she does know what its there for if you ever see her walk towards that area with a i'm about to urinate and annoy you look on her face pick her up and put her in the box after she urinates outside of it don't give in and give her lots of attention this will only make her think that it's okay to do it keep up doing this and you should see an improvement edit if you do what the first answer says she will protest when you let her out if you do do what he she says expect lots of mess to clear up afterwards  Hamster Domestic rabbit Shaggy dog story Aerial (dance move) Pet skunk Social rule Fancy rat Japanese toilet Guinea pig Urine Poker jargon Toilet Dog training Calvin and Hobbes 2000 Australian Grand Prix Prostate cancer Tobacco smoking Professional wrestling holds Toxoplasmosis Mixed martial arts Columbine High School massacre Swingout Garfield Theory of conduct Friends Dog Cat litter House Mouse Japanese tea ceremony Little Britain Humphrey Bogart Urination Boxing Skateboarding trick Monty Hall problem Toilet humour Russian joke Glossary of partner dance terms Ferret Ben Johnson (athlete) Kitten RuneScape quests Jumpstart 3rd Grade The Pet Sounds Sessions Professional wrestling throws Kevin Smith Drug test Strap-on dildo American Psycho Cleveland Browns Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kasparov versus The World Characters in the Smurfs English grammar Fast bowling Volleyball Tick Penis 1957 World Series Kangaroo Escape from New York Richard Chase The Catcher in the Rye The Beach Boys Diseases of the honeybee The Fairly OddParents Phimosis Brown Bear Equine conformation Ocean's Twelve Labrador Retriever The Washington Times Sento Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dog agility Breastfeeding MapleStory Futurama (TV series - season 5) Violin Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Menstrual cycle Dairy Buffalo Bills American football strategy Anderson Cooper The Apprentice 2 Blood Simple Toilet paper The Ersatz Elevator Burning Man Atlas Comics (1950s) Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Avenue Q Ice hockey

i have had fleas very bad for about two weeks now i have put off bombs in my house i put flea collars on my cats and they are still not going away treat the cat go to your vet and get either advantage or frontline plus i went with advantage get yourself a flea comb and comb your cat at least once per day have a bucket with dish soap in it handy to dunk the comb in and to collect the hair fleas can't jump out of the slippery soap no point in combing them out only to have them jump back on your cat flush this down the toilet pour it down the sink or dispose of it away from your house treat your house options are a borate powder product or something that uses diatomaceous earth fleabusters bp fleago natural flea control bp or flea away natural flea powder de put about a tablespoon of this in your vacuum cleaner bag or you can cut up a flea collar to put in there just follow the directions which will vary by product but in general you'll sprinkle on the carpet and vacuum up and also sprinkle into cracks and crevices i chose fleago because it's less expensive than fleabusters i may also try flea away in time vacuum as often as possible before vacuuming stomp around the house this will bring the fleas to life because they'll think there's a tasty morsel out there then vacuum those little bastards up be sure to use your attachments to vacuum as many cracks and crevices as you can they love to hide out there wash any pet bedding in hot water and you'll want to be particularly diligent about vacuuming treating areas where your cat hangs out treat your yard even if your cat doesn't go outside fleas may enter your home if they exist in your yard there's a small chance that you or others may bring fleas in the house with you although this is unlikely get hold of some nematodes to spray in your yard i believe you only have to do this once per year these little creatures will eat the flea larva as one website put it these critters are too small to hug but they deserve it i had to order this online i wasn't able to find a place that sells them in my area and didn't feel like calling every place in the phonebook things not to do don't use any essential oils on your cat particularly anything with pennyroyal or eucalyptus they're toxic to cats don't use flea collars don't give your cat any garlic yeast formulations don't give your cat lemon baths you're going to want to continue treating your home as directed whether that be sprinkling once per week or once a month continue treating throughout flea season when it's warm you can stop during the winter months but start up again in the spring you'll nip them in the bud the key is to treat the environment not the cat if you do that you may never have to apply another flea product directly on them again  Flea Diseases of the honeybee Sento Japanese toilet Brewery Dairy Bedbug Sewage treatment Coffee Menstrual cup Japanese tea ceremony Hamster Cat Tea Theory of conduct Customs and etiquette of Japan Autonomous building Red Hot Chili Peppers Plastic Solar power Textile manufacturing Soap Upholstery Vacuum cleaner Fecal incontinence Illegal drug trade Mattress Guinea pig RuneScape quests Shampoo 613 mitzvot Carburetor Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mosquito Siphon Casting Genericized trademark Pebble bed reactor Tofu Chicken Characters in the Smurfs Baptism Futurama (TV series - season 2) Piccolo Junior Saga John Frusciante Toilet humour Dilbert Toilet Poker jargon Dry cleaning Richard Chase Tobacco Ranma __ characters Soap opera Shaggy dog story Manual transmission Menstrual cycle Kitchen EastEnders Chinchilla The Dalek Invasion of Earth Spidey Super Stories Welding Tattoo Blood (computer game) Cruising (maritime) Glossary of American football Essential oil Satchel Paige Fancy rat Ascariasis Comanche Lumber Pet skunk Teletubbies Tick Professional wrestling match types Basic English Ecco the Dolphin Jackass: The Movie Madonna (entertainer) Bong City of Heroes Vacuum Diatomaceous earth The Fairly OddParents H2G2 Philosophy of space and time Billboard Hot 100 2000 Australian Grand Prix Energy development Phoebe Buffay's songs

i would never declaw my kitten please read this and help i really hate declawing but she scratches everything but the scratching board even if its the basket she scratches the bottom of and i put the board on the bottom by board i mean in is a store bought scratching toy but its not a post i'm getting her a post soon but it might not make a difference the reason i'm not getting her soft paws is because she likes to jump on my shoulder and she wouldn't be able to hold on very well and she likes to dig her claws into my should when my grandma's dog is around it makes her feel safe it also hurts like heck so opinions get her soft paws or not and if you think i should do you think eventually i won't need to buy them and also do the even have smaller soft paws for kittens thanks very much for the squirt gun suggestions i'll probably try that first if you are for declawing cats please dont answer also do you have any experience with purchasing soft paws and how does it effect your cat also if i do get soft paws do they work for front and back paws my cats could still climb with soft paws i believe they come in sizes i bought the soft paws online just look up softpaws or soft claws and a whole bunch of sites will show up after i put them on my cats they tried chewing them off for a couple of minutes but then after about minutes they had already forgotten about them and were climbing on shelfs and windows again they will fall off naturally when their claws shed and then you just trim the nail back down and glue another one on in its place you can also get them at the vet and have the vet put them on for you i use them on both of my cats and they work great they may still try to claw sometimes but they cant puncture anything make sure you use enough of the glue that comes with the soft paws they are inexpensive so they are worth a shot i imagine they wont work for all cats but if it doesn't then you will have only wasted less then i think i bought mine with free shipping for bucks and it had sets in it the instructions only say to put them on the front paws i think if you put them on the back paws then they wont be able to climb even declawed cats get to keep they back claws it is possible that the other lady put the soft paws on right before the claws were ready to shed or she didn't use enough glue you just trim the claws down fill the soft paw up with the glue and slip it over the claw  Cat Guinea pig Pet skunk Garfield Ferret Atomic Kitten RuneScape quests Hamster Domestic rabbit Poker jargon Dog Professional wrestling holds Textile manufacturing Equine conformation Dilbert Shaggy dog story Maneki Neko Upholstery B-47 Stratojet Cello Scale model Dog agility Dairy IPod Internal ballistics The Inside Time Out of Mind American Black Bear Friends Radio controlled airplane Mattress Azumanga Daioh Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Aerial (dance move) Killian documents Menstrual cup Rocko's Modern Life Heinkel He 112 Treehouse of Horror II Blonde on Blonde Inspector Gadget Shen Gong Wu Professional wrestling throws Drill bit Wood carving Krypto the Superdog Knots Landing Professional wrestling match types Detroit Tigers American lobster Treecat The Smoking Room Trigun characters Fancy rat The Amber Spyglass Xiaolin Showdown The Apprentice 3 Volleyball Russian joke Little Britain Atari ST Satchel Paige Cheating in poker Warren Buffett George Costanza Seismic retrofit Married... with Children Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Trapping Glossary of nautical terms Codename: Kids Next Door Violin The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Great Sphinx of Giza Woodworking Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Rent (musical) Dog training Gray Wolf Menstrual cycle Piccolo Junior Saga Halo 2 Coconut crab Natural Selection (computer game) InuYasha (character) Handloading Characters of Naruto English English Donkey Kong 64 Sento Care Bears Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Blood (computer game)

any tips for raising kittens without the help of a mama cat we have them in a nice little hutch and they have plenty of room to roam around we got them a couple of baby bottles just their size and some formula i need some help though because i heard you have to stimulate them to go potty uh help i also have kittens with out a mother that i am fostering fortunately i have help from the spca here's some tips first the little hutch sounds nice and warm they will enjoy that the kittens will also need space to run and play but it sounds like you have that handled too if your kittens are weeks or under you will need to feed them from a bottle here's what you do if the formula is powder then fill the bottle half way full with that and the rest water if it is a liquid formula then i can't help you also when they are weeks old you will want to have a bowl of watered down canned kitten food out depending on the kitten they will need feed times a day but that also depends on how much they eat at a time if you just got your kittens then the first two days you have them they may not poop because of the change of food here's where you come in it may sound a little bit gross but a mother cat will lick the kittens bottom and eat it's poop so you need to take a warm rag and softly in circular motions wipe its bottom but don't eat it if the kitten still hasn't pooped in three days of having them you will need to take them in to the vet and have them flushed out i also recommend that you don't try to make the kittens environment quiet they need to get used to noise other than that they need lots and lots of love care and attention good luck  Cat Kitten Toilet humour Japanese tea ceremony Pet skunk Guinea pig Little Britain Hamster Socialization Brewery Tea Bong Garfield Ron and Fez Mattress Feral cat Thermal power station Dairy Phoebe Buffay's songs Rocko's Modern Life Atomic Kitten Internet phenomenon Ferret Chinese New Year RuneScape quests Social rule Japanese toilet Glossary of nautical terms Trailer Park Boys Chicken Pitaten Puma Joke StarCraft: Hybrid Coffee Sea-Monkey Chocolate Sampling (music) Chopsticks Internal ballistics The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Fancy rat Kakapo Caffeine Water Soap bubble Poker jargon Elephant Ship naming and launching Situation comedy Idli Fecal incontinence Urinary incontinence Roxette Big Brother UK series 5 Alma Cogan Hiking Microeconomics The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Champagne (beverage) Giant Panda Azumanga Daioh Hearing aid Sewage treatment Nestl__ Infant formula Spider Livestock Breakfast Purr Cats (musical) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Houseplant The Jazz Singer Equine conformation Rabbit Textile manufacturing Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Big Brother UK series 6 Shrimp farm The McGuire Sisters Great Teacher Onizuka Mid-levels Bonus Stage Kitchen Rose (Doctor Who) Maine Coon Kimi Finster Infant Customs and etiquette of Japan The Beatles bootlegs Violin Insomnia Brown Bear Girly

flea problem i have an indoor cat that has somehow gotten fleas my house is always clean so that isn't the problem i dog sat for family a few weeks back and that's the only thing i can figure that would bring fleas in the house bombs don't work and my cat is allergic to the flea collars does anyone know of an easy effective fix for both the house and the cat before i go insane treat the cat go to your vet and get either advantage or frontline plus i went with advantage get yourself a flea comb and comb your cat at least once per day have a bucket with dish soap in it handy to dunk the comb in and to collect the hair fleas can't jump out of the slippery soap no point in combing them out only to have them jump back on your cat flush this down the toilet pour it down the sink or dispose of it away from your house treat your house options are a borate powder product or something that uses diatomaceous earth fleabusters bp fleago natural flea control bp or flea away natural flea powder de put about a tablespoon of this in your vacuum cleaner bag or you can cut up a flea collar to put in there just follow the directions which will vary by product but in general you'll sprinkle on the carpet and vacuum up and also sprinkle into cracks and crevices i chose fleago because it's less expensive than fleabusters i may also try flea away in time vacuum as often as possible before vacuuming stomp around the house this will bring the fleas to life because they'll think there's a tasty morsel out there then vacuum those little bastards up be sure to use your attachments to vacuum as many cracks and crevices as you can they love to hide out there wash any pet bedding in hot water and you'll want to be particularly diligent about vacuuming treating areas where your cat hangs out treat your yard even if your cat doesn't go outside fleas may enter your home if they exist in your yard there's a small chance that you or others may bring fleas in the house with you although this is unlikely get hold of some nematodes to spray in your yard i believe you only have to do this once per year these little creatures will eat the flea larva as one website put it these critters are too small to hug but they deserve it i had to order this online i wasn't able to find a place that sells them in my area and didn't feel like calling every place in the phonebook things not to do don't use any essential oils on your cat particularly anything with pennyroyal or eucalyptus they're toxic to cats don't use flea collars don't give your cat any garlic yeast formulations don't give your cat lemon baths you're going to want to continue treating your home as directed whether that be sprinkling once per week or once a month continue treating throughout flea season when it's warm you can stop during the winter months but start up again in the spring you'll nip them in the bud the key is to treat the environment not the cat if you do that you may never have to apply another flea product directly on them again  Flea Diseases of the honeybee Hamster Japanese toilet Cat Dairy Menstrual cup Japanese tea ceremony Sewage treatment Brewery Bedbug Theory of conduct Bread Coffee Shampoo Fancy rat Thermal power station Soap Vacuum cleaner Fecal incontinence Plastic Upholstery Illegal drug trade Tea Shaggy dog story Equine conformation Customs and etiquette of Japan Carburetor Baptism Tattoo The Amber Spyglass Autonomous building Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mattress Dry cleaning RuneScape quests Piccolo Junior Saga Characters in the Smurfs Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Chicken Dilbert Toilet Sin City Richard Chase Mosquito Casting Genericized trademark Energy development Manual transmission Toilet paper Chinchilla Welding Pebble bed reactor EastEnders Poker jargon Kitchen Toilet humour 613 mitzvot Menstrual cycle Linked list Blood (computer game) Vacuum tube Comanche Vacuum Spidey Super Stories Sauna Futurama (TV series - season 2) The Dalek Invasion of Earth Social rule Professional wrestling match types Water Chocolate Tofu John Frusciante Jackass: The Movie Ranma __ characters Tag Philosophy of space and time Cruising (maritime) Tick Lumber Common cold Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Soap opera Knots Landing Randomness Glossary of climbing terms Teletubbies M16 (rifle) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma

can steroid ointment prescribed by the vet cause vomiting in cat my cat who is very petite has a cut in her eyelid which watered and swelled the vet gave us a steroid ointment to treat it three days ago today she threw up her supper not a cat who throws up at all either after growling and gagging the vet is closed i am stopping treatment until i talk to him but has anyone heard of a relation between steriods and vomiting otherwise she is a perfectly healthy and cared for cat no worms etc since the cut is on her eyelid your vet probably prescribed an ointment that is safe to use directly in the eye just in case medications like that are extremely safe and topical ointments are generally not absorbed into the system to cause a systemic reaction like vomiting also steroids are the commonly used treatment for allergic reactions and are extremely well tolerated by cats cats are the best vomiters in the world so i would think by what you described that your cat got a small piece of food stuck and while trying to dislodge it vomited everything up don't be alarmed and continue using the ointment as prescribed but should your cat vomit more frequently and show any other symptoms call your vet to see if something else is going on and to help you feel better my cat has ibd and needs periodic steroid injections to stop him from the several times a day vomiting of his freshly ingested food  Psoriasis Conjunctivitis Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Radiation therapy Paracetamol First aid Eczema Ulcerative colitis Insulin Hay fever Inflammatory bowel disease Urinary incontinence Fancy rat Rosacea Crohn's disease Cat Diarrhea Gastroparesis Asthma Diabetes mellitus Fecal incontinence Gout Medical prescription Chronic fatigue syndrome Anaphylaxis Homeopathy Cluster headache Osteoarthritis Coeliac disease Diazepam Aloe Cephalexin Multiple chemical sensitivity Food allergy Hamster M__ni__re___s disease Medical cannabis Garfield Pneumonia Group A streptococcal infection Anabolic steroid Hypoglycemia Addiction Mercury (element) Aspartame Chemotherapy Chocolate Foodborne illness Spider Ferret Carpal tunnel syndrome Scabies Acne Buprenorphine Prostate cancer Ebola Hyperemesis gravidarum 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Migraine Dracunculiasis Botulism Clomipramine Drug addiction Zinc Maprotiline Snake Clinical depression Animal testing Trichinosis Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Heartworm Antidepressant Multiple sclerosis AIDS Phimosis Acupuncture Anesthesia Paget's disease of bone Menstrual cycle Glucocorticoid Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Epidural Nitroglycerin Traditional Chinese medicine Mouth ulcer Hydrogen peroxide Controlled Substances Act

is it easy to clean a cat litter box so i'm thinking about getting a cat my mom are trying to know more about the responsibility of it before our minds are made up anyways one of my friends said its really difficult with the cat litter box because it smells really bad its hard to clean is it true well it's urine and feces so it doesn't smell like cinnamon buns but cat litter is made out of clay the scoopable type is treated so it clumps which absorbs the moisture and there are litters made out of wood and corn and some other substances if you want to go with something a little more biodegradeable the box will smell right after the cat uses it poopwise but if you keep it scooped the box shouldn't reek badly you can also buy an automatic litter box for one cat a littermaid would probably be fine cleaning isn't hard if you're using regular clay regular litter not the clumping type litter you can put a plastic bag or box liner in the box before you put the litter in so changing taking out the old used litter and putting in new litter is only a matter of wrapping up the plastic liner with the clumpable litter you just scoop out the used litter uring will clump into a ball making it easy to scoop out and you'll only have to replace litter once in a while you do have to remember to clean it though set up a schedule so you don't forget because many cats won't use a dirty litterbox and they'll start going other places you don't want them to and it is almost impossible to get the smell out and to retrain the cat before you get your cat make sure you have a practical safe place to keep the litterbox someplace that is always accessible to the cat that is easily cleanable cats will track almost any kind of litter it's probably a bad idea to keep a the box in an area human sleep or eat or do food prep in germs the box also has to feel safe to the cat not too exposed but not so hard to get to that the cat finds somewhere else to go hey if millions of people keeping cats can clean the litter how hard can it really be  Cat Hamster Cat litter Plastic Fancy rat Social rule Guinea pig Mattress Japanese tea ceremony Urinary incontinence Domestic rabbit Collecting fossils Genericized trademark Shaggy dog story Fecal incontinence Theory of conduct Pet skunk Animal communication Knife Menstrual cup Water YuYu Hakusho Homer Simpson Bong Pitaten Waste management Diaper Ron and Fez Shit Toilet Textile manufacturing Dustbin The Catcher in the Rye Dog Toxoplasmosis Phoebe Buffay's songs Kitchen Drill bit Characters in the Smurfs M16 (rifle) Plastic bag Pottery Anchor Epistemology Clothing Sinfest Time Out of Mind Guns, Germs, and Steel Upholstery Surveillance Cremation Dairy Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968 RuneScape quests Violin Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Cardboard Tofu Cocaine Avenue Q Foodborne illness Hey Arnold!

ok serious question good answers would be appreciated thanks im planning on becoming a veterinarian doctor and hopefully i do become one but i heard that vets also have to perform abortions on some dogs if asked to by clients can i get in trouble for refusing do abortions the reason why i wanna be a vet is cause i love animals but i dont wanna perform abortions i wanna help animals save them etc any of u guys know what can happen if i refuse perform abortions on dogs yes there is that problem with many dogs out there in animal shelters being put down cause there are no homes for them but thats why ppl should spay or neuter their pets once they adopt and or buy or recieve a pet asap of course if an animal was suffering i would put he she down so they wouldnt suffer anymore we had put down my pitbull puppy because she had distemper it's a tough issue most people are having pets fixed that are already prego and your right most of these animals would be put down because of overcrowding you might run into problems because part of being in medicine is doing things you might not like or agree with you might have a problem finding a regular job you might look for a job at a no kill shelter but again you won't get the pay you might have gotten somewhere else good luck you might consider working at shelter for awhile and make sure it's something you really want to do  Dog Veterinarian Cat Pet skunk Ferret Animal shelter Socialization Docking Microchip implant (animal) Avenue Q Abortion Guinea pig Housebreaking Rabies The Beach Boys Feral cat Contract Domestic rabbit Dobermann Puppy mill Animal rights Pitaten Knots Landing Jon Secada Working dog Roe v.

should we really get our cat's teeth worked on we have a cat twelve years old who went to the vet for the first time in a couple of years today she has just become an outdoor cat since we bought our house the vet suggested that we have some teeth extracted since she has four cavities and one tooth has broken off leaving an exposed nerve now this sounds horrible but the cat acts fine the procedure could cost up to and can only be done if the cat passes some blood tests and such we can afford the procedure but it will put a crimp in some of our spending for a little while i want to be a compassionate pet owner but on the other hand i don't want to be paying a lot of money for something i can't tell is wrong and that doesn't affect the cat's behavior and she doesn't seem to be suffering so considering the practical ethical and financial ground should let the vet do it would you do it can you tell if your cat has pain just because she isn't suffering doesn't mean that she isn't in some lesser form of pain how would you feel if you had a bunch of cavities and an exposed nerve it sounds like you are only conserned with the cost and not the cats long term health any of those teeth can get infected and abscess and then the vet cost is going to be even more  Guinea pig Dental caries Chronic fatigue syndrome Cat Ferret Pneumonia Procrastination Tuberculosis Pet skunk Friends Microeconomics Veterinarian Acupuncture Domestic rabbit Tooth enamel Rabies Dentistry Economics Babe Ruth Zoophilia Trigeminal nerve Tooth Goodness and value theory Dog Animal rights Prostate cancer Capital punishment Cocaine Breastfeeding Pitaten Life insurance Theory of conduct Menstrual cycle Maxilla Multiple sclerosis Badly Drawn Kitties Gross domestic product Garfield Medicare (Canada) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tobacco smoking Equine conformation Vulcan (Star Trek) Time Out of Mind Divorce Local anesthesia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Methamphetamine Female genital cutting Mesothelioma Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Shaggy dog story Massage Malaria Colorectal cancer Capitalism Kidney Hell Knots Landing Animal testing Theodicy Stem cell Enzyme Growth hormone treatment Randomness Microchip implant (animal) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Naruto jutsu Nine Inch Nails Oral sex Human sexual behavior Asbestos Estoppel Health insurance Abortion debate Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Alignment (role-playing games) Urinary incontinence Blood transfusion Mode choice Stuttering Tetrapod Spanking Hypnosis Characters of Naruto Housebreaking Cancer Dualism (philosophy of mind) The Smoking Room Animal euthanasia Insurance Meme Dog training Mandible Abscess

what to do if a cat is choking i have a couple of cats and i've always wondered what to do if they are choking because when they usually are coughing up hairballs they made a horrible sound as if they are choking and it scares me even though of the time its usually a hairball well sweetie if the cat is one you know and you believe that an object such as a bone might be in its throat and obstructing the cat's breathing reach in with your fingers or tweezers and try to remove it if the blockage is further down lay the cat on its side place the heel of your hand just behind the last rib angling slightly upward and push firmly but not so firmly as to break the ribs four quick thrusts should dislodge the obstruction if not try again if unsuccessful take the cat to a veterinarian immediately look inside your cat's mouth for any obvious foreign body do not poke about in his mouth without looking or you may push a foreign body back into his throat if there is a foreign body in the mouth attempt to remove it use the tweezers dull point or pencil eraser end in your first aid kit if appropriate however if the object appears to be deep in your cat's throat leave it alone or you may push it further down towards his airway if your cat is choking quickly lift him up by his hindlegs so that his head is dangling down and slap the side of his rib cage with two fingers of your free hand in sharp 'cough like' jerky movements you should only move your hands a little in order to stimulate a sudden rush of air from his lungs this should help to dislodge any foreign body stuck at the back of the throat be sensible about the amount of pressure that you apply particularly with a kitten do not slap too hard or you may break the ribs as soon as your cat coughs out the foreign body settle him on the ground and let him calm down in his own time ensure that your cat cannot leave the house continue to watch over your cat be careful not to stimulate him in any way and try to discourage him from moving about contact your vet to tell your vet what has happened there is little point in doing so sooner unless you have someone with you who can make a telephone call as this will waste precious time your cat's best chance of survival rests with you good question b  Professional wrestling holds Equine conformation Abdominal thrusts Drowning Professional wrestling throws Cat Bong Professional wrestling attacks First aid Knife Ferret Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Volleyball Diving Aerial (dance move) Violin Backstroke Skateboarding trick Snooker Urinary incontinence Fast bowling Internal ballistics Tetrapod Strap-on dildo Gesture Condom Boxing Vomiting Breastfeeding Tobacco smoking Sin City Breaststroke Lung The Inside Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Swingout Butterfly stroke Dog training Canoe Glossary of climbing terms Domestic violence Tenshinhan Lung cancer Fire fighting Wing Chun Domestic rabbit Jet engine Guinea pig Drill bit Carburetor Avalanche Glossary of American football Professional wrestling match types Glossary of partner dance terms Horizontal bar Cricket Field hockey Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Eye Asthma Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Double bass Cancer Fancy rat Tag Naruto jutsu Dog Front crawl Chopsticks Anatomical terms of location Professional wrestling slang Oral sex Clarinet Toilet humour Triage Tai Chi Chuan Decompression sickness Shaggy dog story Mixed martial arts Swimming Sternum Pottery Three Stooges Sleep apnea Drawing Reflexology Siphon Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Powerbomb Kasparov versus The World Tooth enamel Salad Fingers Glossary of ballet terms Operation Market Garden Trapping Suplex

kitten throwing up food updated it started last they would eat and play and throw up the food is this normal it looks like the food watered down i feed them whiskas meaty selections chicken turkey flaovrs with crunchy meaty nuggets ive been feeding it to the since the beginning of the week and its been fine but now its just doing it so im worried the bigger kitten throws up and eats again and the goes back to play i dont think its the smaller kitten but im still worried about both of them they seem fine sleep in the day and play at night i need help with this first i was feeding the friskies and whiskas soft food and it became way to expensive to i switched it i want everyones opinion on this and if you know any vet please have them answer this question they are months one makes a sound llike a growling puppy kind of it very cute and does it when he play well this morning i found no throw up and i havent seen any all day im still worried it turns out that the food i feed them is full of fillers so ill switch it hello jay do you feed them kitten food i don't know the brand that you describe but they should not be given adult cat food they must have kitten food until they are one year old in the uk felix and whiskas do a kitten food variety also hi life and sounds like nature's own felix is the cheapest brand local supermarkets usually stock the whiskas and possibly the felix kitten food you will find a bigger range at a pet shop such as pets at home you can also get kitten food from the vets the kittens also need to have fresh water available in particular if you feed them the dry kitten food variety that the vets offer water is absolutely essential kitten food is more expensive than adult cat food but it is vital that you provide them with the correct nutrition now so that they can develop and enjoy good health in their adult life if they are five months or older they can have two to three meals a day if they are younger than five months they can have three to four meals a day alternatively you can leave food out for them to eat as they wish but any uneaten moist food shoul be discarded after hours if you find that vomiting still persists after giving them the correct food then you should have them checked by the vet regards chirpy  Kitten Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Garfield Cat Fancy rat Hamster Cat food Food Chicken Chocolate Tofu Nutrition Hypoglycemia Veganism Dog Breakfast Breastfeeding Cheese Livestock Stomach cancer RuneScape quests Fasting Socialization Ferret Fish and chips Egg (food) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pet skunk Atomic Kitten Hamburger Discus (fish) Ron and Fez Ralston Purina Company Terri Schiavo Tick Nestl__ McDonald's Ramen Roman eating and drinking Dog training Feral cat Super Size Me Pedigree pet food Big Brother UK series 5 Kakapo Korean cuisine Milk Cuisine of Denmark Japanese tea ceremony Capercaillie French cuisine Coffee Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Social rule Wall Street Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Biological pest control Little Britain Phoebe Buffay's songs Fast food Vegetarianism Flea Shaggy dog story Peruvian cuisine Chicken soup Wal-Mart Hiberno-English Dairy Bread Organic farming Japanese cuisine Taboo food and drink Raw food diet Felix the Cat Toilet humour Coeliac disease Fecal incontinence Paintball Kodocha Housebreaking Girly Wheel of Fortune Softball Puma Lamprey RuneScape Random Events Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Avenue Q Folic acid Cuisine of Malaysia Thermoregulation Cuteness Tea Delicatessen

is getting a month old kitten right for us hi my boyfriend and i are interested in adopting one month old or slightly older kitten i currently work in an office offsite for hours weekdays my boyfriend freelances at home all day so he would be around to take care play with the kitten i understand that kittens need a lot of attention throughout the day several feedings etc but at what age should they start to become more independent not needing as much playing time and down to feedings a day i'm asking in case my boyfriend gets a new job and will be working offsite as well thanks thanks so far unfortunately we're only allowed to have cat in our apartment we're just unsure because there's a possibility that my boyfriend could get a full time job within the next few months and then both of us won't be home kittens don't really need a hole lot of attention me and my fiancee just got one about a month ago now we both work all day i come home once for lunch but that's it we have another cat and the two of them just chill out on the bed all day i assume anyway they free feed and go in the litter box when needed you should be fine with a new kitten from what you said  Kitten RuneScape quests Ferret Ron and Fez Feral cat Dead Like Me Fancy rat Pet skunk Social rule Manx (cat) Cat Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Phoebe Buffay's songs Friends The O.C.

get roundworms from a cat when i first got my kitten about three weeks ago i found out he had roundworms coming out from him and he sometimes had accidents on me while i was laying down or sleeping before i got him treated should i be worried about having caught them okay everyone who answered is talking about ringworm ringworm is a fungus on the outside of the cat roundworm is inside the cat and he may throw them up it's gross but they look like bean sprouts but i don't think you have any reason to be worried cats mostly just pass them on to each other you should try ringing your vet and just asking them over the phone but i highly doubt it if your pet gets ringworm that's a different story because humans can get ringworm from cats  Ferret Shaggy dog story Garfield Ringworm Kitten Roundworm Animal Cat Socialization RuneScape quests Ascariasis Guinea pig Friends Fungus Phoebe Buffay's songs Feral cat Dog Fancy rat Manx (cat) One Piece minor characters Social rule Piccolo Junior Saga Brian Griffin Flea El Goonish Shive The Amber Spyglass The Fairly OddParents Roswell UFO incident Baldrick Heartworm Pet Sematary Apoptosis Baylisascaris Hookworm Pet The Secret of NIMH Girly The Pilgrim's Progress Tiger Treecat African American Vernacular English The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents Animal rights Puss in Boots Domestication Chocolate Sin City Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist God Emperor of Dune Dilbert Taboo food and drink Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Xiaolin Showdown Rabies Goatse.cx Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Rent (musical) Veterinarian Tekken characters Minor Harry Potter Beasts The Subtle Knife Avenue Q AFI 100 Years series Running gag Doraemon Ocean's Twelve Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Cheetah Shrek 2 Catwoman Toilet humour Soil life Puma Ron and Fez Tokyo Mew Mew Tick Killian documents Immortality Mr. Bean Azumanga Daioh The Inside Chronic fatigue syndrome Yin Shun Parasite Turkish Van Rocko's Modern Life Hamster Greebo Catgirl Shawn Michaels Rabbit Philadelphia Eagles Krypto the Superdog Garfield and Friends The Catcher in the Rye Alley Cat Phaedo Mycosis Zagreus (Doctor Who audio)

my cat has turned on my other cat i had my nd cat spayed today and now my first cat is hissing and jumping at the recovering cat this is totally not normal as they usually love each other to bits having been born to the same litter and lived with each other since this is upsetting me to see it and i'm wondering if this is normal i've kept them apart all night and the bully cat was going bezerk let her in this morning and she sniffed and went ape one of her claws ended up embedded in my finger so they're now seperated again as others have said it's because the cat who was spayed has come home from the vet smelling different cats rely very heavily on their sense of smell and your first cat is unsettled of the strange scent that the second cat now has and doesn't know what to make of it when cats feel threatened they have two reactions flight or fight your first cat has chosen the latter option you may need to slowly re introduce them something similar happened to me about six weeks ago when our male cat merlin sneaked outdoors and hid in the engine space of a parked car when i eventually managed to resuce him and brought him back inside i wasn't prepared for the hostile reaction from our female cat sophie she was hissing growling and trying to attack him she was really aggressive i decided to separate them and reintroduce them to each other as if they had never met before sophie had the run of the home allowing her to feel in charge of her territory and i kept merlin in our bedroom overnight with his food water and a litter tray i thought that sophie might have calmed down overnight but no such luck she hissed as soon as she saw him so i let merlin have the run of the house and put sophie in our bedroom for a couple of hours so that she could investigate his smell i also let sophie smell my hands after handling merlin as another way of getting her used to his scent i repeated the room scent swapping process every day until on the fourth day sophie could finally tolerate his presence in the same room as her for about a week or so merlin was still a little wary of being around sophie but things improved on a daily basis and after a couple of weeks their friendship was back to normal now they groom each other and playfight just like they always did i don't know if it helped or not but i also used a feliway spray as they are said to emit pheromones that are soothing to cats be patient it will may take a little while but once their scents become intermingled things will start to improve good luck  Cat Pet skunk Dog Domestic rabbit Kakapo Social rule Shaggy dog story Animal communication The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe God Emperor of Dune Ferret Sin City Galaxy Angel Pitaten Poker jargon Fancy rat RuneScape quests The Death Gate Cycle Menstrual cycle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) House Mouse Ranma __ characters Milton H.

why does my cat lick the couch we bought new microfiber furniture about a month ago and my cat has taken to profusely licking the top of the back pillows he also licks the carpet in places where food wouldn't have been dropped the top of the stairs outside my bathroom a few years back he used to lick our old comforter but stopped just as suddenly as he started what is going on sounds like self stimulation just like a baby or toddler may such his thumb some people shake their leg up and down or tap their fingers on the table or click their pen all self stimulation some cats kneed many cats who kneed and suck do so because they were separated from their mothers before they were completely weened this is the cause for self stimulating behaviors sounds to me like your cat licks if it's really a problem you can try putting cayanne pepper where he licks but he will hate it and may find another place to lick self stimulation usually isn't an easy behavior to change  Breastfeeding Chair Strap-on dildo Cat Dog training Professional wrestling holds Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story Friends Forty Licks Anal sex Hamster Dog Surveillance Kitchen Fast bowling Skateboarding trick Manx (cat) Domestication Salad Fingers Spanking Giant Panda RuneScape quests Toilet humour Knots Landing Felis sapiens Equine conformation Glossary of ballet terms Piccolo Junior Saga Horizontal bar Guitar Oral sex The dozens 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Socialization Woman on top sex position Bass guitar Elephant Drawn Together Paul Is Dead Phoebe Buffay's songs Darken Rahl Trapping Make money fast Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Professional wrestling throws Chopsticks Ranma __ characters Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Milton H.

is my cat about to have her kittens her nipples are sticking out and they are hard most of the time she just lays on the kitchen floor i do not know when exactly she got pregnant but i know it was about weeks ago i have a boy cat not the daddy and last night he was running all over the place and chesed her a couple times he also tried to mount her is the a sign that the kittens are coming hey there you need to keep checking her private area for mucus or a bubble you need to keep a close eye on her and watch her behaviour if you notice anything out of the ordinary this could be a sign you can check to see if she is lactating if she has milk in her ducks nipples by just squeezing a little gently and if there is milk this could indicate that she is close to having her babies if he tummy has got increasingly hard meowing alot more and being very restless such as getting up and laying down and trying to clean her private area alot now she might be more friendly towards you but she might want to be alone if this is her first litter you need to make her a bed and watch her so as she does not try to hide somewhere and get stuck such as in draws or in your wardrobe she might stop eating hours before the birth but this isnt always the case it varies in every cat  Cat Breastfeeding Guinea pig Kitten Nipple Mammary gland The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Elephant Friends Fertility awareness Hamster Platypus Fancy rat Sin City Ron and Fez RuneScape quests Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dairy Shaggy dog story Prolactin Tasmanian Devil Chocolate Garfield Humphrey Bogart Menstrual cycle Situation comedy Domestic rabbit Conker's Bad Fur Day Pet skunk Phoebe Buffay's songs Richard Chase Big Brother UK series 5 Manx (cat) Urinary incontinence Trainspotting (novel) Toxoplasmosis Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kakapo Little Britain Violin Cheese Milton H.

cat urine i am not a cat person for this very reason my sister came to visit for the day and against my wishes she brought along her cats yesterday as i was on the floor playign with my month old son the carpet smelled of cat piss i steam cleaned it with the soultion for pets and then went over it with a water bleach carpet is white solution and it still smells the carpet isnt old the house itself is under yrs old how can i get rid of this damn smell so it wont come back ive tried febreeze also febreze just coats the carpet it doesn't get rid of the smell cleaning the carpet with bleach does some good but isn't enough for two reasons first because bleach doesn't really break down the ammonia contained in cat urine and two because the padding under the carpet is probably soaked with the urine and the cleaning didn't reach it or didn't reach enough of it there are a lot of products out there that breakdown the cat urine to eliminate the lingering odor they are all enzyme based products that are meant to target the specific chemical make up of the cat urine i use simple solution myself but there are a lot of them out there to choose from ask your vet or pet store manager for the products they recommend and when using the product the key is to apply enough product to soak into the carpet padding underneath then allow it to dry completely it's the only way to get all of the problem taken care of  Ammonia Hydrogen peroxide Cat Menstrual cup Carpet Hamster Fancy rat Urinal Guinea pig Wood pulp Urinary incontinence Japanese toilet Toilet humour Toilet Menstrual cycle Brewery Drug test Domestic rabbit Tofu Natt__ Tooth enamel Theory of conduct Shampoo Chlorine Animal Crossing Extreme Programming 1,4-dichlorobenzene Composting toilet Psoriasis Marine aquarium Traumatic incident reduction Social rule Coir Body piercing Paracetamol Enzyme Diaper Diabetes mellitus Tetrachloroethylene Hemp Basement Pitaten Cannabis cultivation Diseases of the honeybee Tobacco smoking Phoebe Halliwell Cyanide Dishwashing Hydrogen economy Disinfection Aladdin (1992 film) Organic peroxide Nirvana (band) Sin City Laundry detergent Dairy Hydrogen Chair Pet skunk Vitamin C Energy development Oplan Bojinka Manicure Flatulence Multiple chemical sensitivity Upholstery Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bleach Sulfur Protein Mattress Water purification Bong Pet Sounds Ron Weasley Wound Clomipramine Dishwasher USS Ticonderoga (CV-14) Tattoo Cat litter Economics Ferret Microeconomics Neopets Shaggy dog story Esperanto grammar Skunk Piccolo Junior Saga Ozone Plastic

why does my kitten suck on my clothes and how can i stop it premature weaning can be a cause of this behaviour often a kitten will transfer it's infantile dependence on it's mother to it's new owner however it is a habit that should gently be discouraged though rare some cats will progress from sucking to eating fabric a condition known as pica it's a case of being cruel to be kind i'm afraid in order to reduce your kitten's attachment to you as mother figure you need to be a little less available if during cuddling sessions the kitten begins suckling on your clothes gently move him aside and walk away it sounds mean but it's the same way the mother cat rejects her kittens when she is weaning them if there are other people in the home get them to help with feeding and grooming duties as this will spread the kitten's loyalties and shift the focus away from you as mother figure set aside time every day for regular play sessions which will help your kitten focus on something other than nursing on your clothes toys that dangle off the end of a wand stick are great because kittens can practice their hunting skills on these hope this helps good luck  Cat Breastfeeding Kitten Garfield Domestic rabbit Ferret Kakapo Elephant Comanche Infantilism Hamster Cephalic disorder Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Milton H.

what's the right choice i work at the humane society as a volunteer and recently they've begun a crackdown on ill cats it's one of my jobs to report any possible symptoms of disease well there was a cage of kittens and two were sneezing what's the right choice i had two choices not report the sneezing and risk all three of their lives or possibly save all three or to report the sneezing and get the two kittens killed but definetly save the third what's the right choice why also i have two cats of my own at home and i don't want them to get sick so fostering was completely out of the question follow the rules harsh as they seem the rules are there for a reason upper respiratory infections spread like wildfire and an entire shelter can become infected if that happens every cat there will have to be euthanized the building will have to be thoroughly cleaned and no more cats can be taken in for a quarantine period usually two weeks i know your heart goes out to the little sick kittens a feline uri can be treated though it's not cheap and the treatment goes on for a while personally i would find the responsibility for reporting disease symptoms too heavy for me and i would resign and volunteer elsewhere deciding what symptom is significant and which are not is a job for a person trained in vet medicine not a volunteer and i wouldn't want to think an animal's future was depending on my opinion  Common cold Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Rabies Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Group A streptococcal infection Pneumonia Feral cat Cat H5N1 Tuberculosis Domestic rabbit Heartworm Prostate cancer Stomach cancer Transmission (medicine) Sexually-transmitted infection Ferret Pet skunk Hepatitis C Disease Fancy rat Guinea pig Malaria Quarantine Medicine Influenza Ebola Spanish flu Socialization Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Sleeping sickness Avian influenza Ulcerative colitis Lung cancer Kitten Upper respiratory tract infection Anthrax Tobacco smoking Toxoplasmosis Multiple sclerosis Cancer Coeliac disease Bubonic plague Alcoholism Rocky Mountain spotted fever Chronic fatigue syndrome Asthma Animal shelter Abortion Traumatic brain injury Psoriasis Health insurance Legionellosis Chagas disease Decompression sickness Infectious mononucleosis HIV vaccine First aid Virus Colorectal cancer Escherichia coli O157:H7 Urinary incontinence Bipolar disorder Cytomegalovirus Feral Hypertension Hyperthyroidism Palliative care Stroke Smallpox Progress of the SARS outbreak Clinical depression Poliomyelitis Leukemia Diarrhea Vaccine Theory of conduct Diabetes mellitus Breast cancer West Nile virus Aspartame Obsessive-compulsive disorder Animal euthanasia Biological warfare Addiction Natural health Lupus erythematosus Foodborne illness American Red Cross Influenza pandemic Omega-3 fatty acid Euthanasia

how can i stop my cat from constantly meowing he's a year old maincoon who constantly meows and cries most of it is related to going outside i believe when he was young he escaped and was outside for about hours since then he constantly cries to go out i do take him outside for supervised periods of time because i feel so bad that he's all cooped up i never let him out of eyesight in our fenced in backyard some people have said that i should just never take him out again but i feel this is mean he knows what's out there and i think would be crushed if he never got to go again he also cries at night he's never been out at night so i think this is more related to his sister with whom he was raised from birth dying months ago maybe he's looking for her he'll even sometimes cry when i do have him outside as if he's looking for her he's a great cat best i've ever owned but the crying is incessant and really annoying i don't want to punish him for it it's not like he knows it's wrong what can i do he probably does miss his sister or at least other cats to keep him company have you thought of getting a second cat to replace his sister he'd probably be happier if he's getting enough attention and isn't crying because he's hungry let him out get him a good body harness and a long retractable lead line any good pet store will have them tie him out there and let him explore hunt at his leisure he'll soon be crying to come back in i know people say it's not healthy for them to be out but i disagree it's their nature to be outside hunting and they need access to grass to eat for removing hair balls and for proper digestion mine cries continually if kept in during the day of course she does not run away so is allowed to come and go as she pleases and sleeps well all night in her bed without crying but then it really is annoying constantly opening and closing the door for her during the day like a kid constantly in and out  Cat Shaggy dog story Pitaten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders The Amber Spyglass Ferret Knots Landing Guinea pig Ranma __ characters Hamster Springfield Elementary School Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an W.I.T.C.H.

how can you tell if a mother cat's milk is drying up my cat gave birth to one kitten and moved her somewhere yesterday we can't find the kitten momma cat is gone for hours at a time presumably with baby how can i tell if momma cat's milk is drying up i am looking for concrete signs that baby is okay i've tried following momma cat to see where baby is but momma is too slick for that she watches first to see who is around last night i followed her outside she sat on the front lawn until i went inside i ran inside to watch her from the front window to see where she was going in the seconds it took me to get there she was gone thank you for the answers if you only have one kitten then most of the mammary glands will dry up except the one that the kitten is using that is your clue that the kitten is nursing one teat will look different than the rest more in use the fact that mama cat is gone for long periods does indicate that she is caring for her kitten  Mammary gland Breastfeeding The dozens Childbirth Phoebe Buffay's songs Nipple Goatse.cx Teat Milk Dairy RuneScape quests Elephant Guinea pig Through the Looking-Glass Thermoregulation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prolactin Big Brother UK series 5 Atomic Kitten Mary Cassatt Giant Panda Jon Secada Pet skunk Weather lore 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Paul Is Dead Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Urinary incontinence Domestic goat Breast Martin Lawrence Purr Infant Premature birth Cats (musical) Rais massacre Nestl__ Pulp Fiction Comanche Mammal B3ta Friends StarCraft: Hybrid Cytomegalovirus Platypus Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Mama's Family Ferret Feral cat Manx (cat) Louis Wain Whose Line Is It Anyway?

what is a catnip party but i figure this term for cats for example the cat is having a great catnip cat refuses to share her catnip i've watched so many video regarding this catnip in youtube com i get the idea though but the term catnip is so difficult to explain as a professional breeder a catnip party is when i take catnip and place several mounds of it on the floor and watch the fun begin each cat responds to it differently so it is much fun to watch the zany antics that ensue  Nepeta Cat Final Fantasy Legend III Scooby-Doo Animaniacs Late Night with Conan O'Brien Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Mickey Mouse Advertising Official Monster Raving Loony Party And the Children Shall Lead Clown Siamese (cat) Calvin and Hobbes Pok__mon (video games) The Cat in the Hat Sesame Street Newshounds Pitaten Term logic Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Garfield Valerian (plant) Monster Rancher monsters Muhammad Ali Hybrid Sinfest Ren and Stimpy Beavis and Butt-head Confucianism Buttocks Miss Saigon Inception of Darwin's theory Lead and follow (dance) Estrus cycle Nominalism Dilbert Deconstruction Species April O'Neil Abstraction Princess Tutu Domestic rabbit Internet phenomenon Twin Politics of the United States Mario Kart 64 Domestication Koji Kondo Eek!

cat behavior my indoor cat has all the sudden took up with this one toy and he carries it around in his mouth like a dog would do and does this crazy sounding meow does anyone know why he would do this thanks this is a feather toy it doesn't have any catnip on it a previous female cat of mine had a soft toy that she used to carry around the home even though she was spayed i initially thought it might be some kind of maternal instinct until i caught her one day biting and kicking hell out of it with her back legs that made me think that perhaps she viewed it more as prey than off spring she also liked to play fetch which is a hunting type game so that also made me think that her carrying the toy was all part of practicing her hunting skills who knows maybe it helped her judge what size of prey she could successfully tackle and bring home  Cat Dog Ferret Hamster Tyrannosaurus rex Housebreaking Dog training Maine Coon Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Gray Wolf Tag Lion Hunting Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Puma Leopard American football Socialization Pet skunk Kakapo Wolf's Rain Falconry Breastfeeding Canadian football Nepeta Spider Rugby union Peafowl Orca Shaggy dog story Pump It Up Bladderwort Archery Glossary of American football The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Dinosaur The Apprentice 2 Toy train Rugby union positions Air gun National Football League Lore Mickey Mouse Manx (cat) Characters of The Sandman Pinball Trapping Dilbert Field hockey The Strangerhood RuneScape quests Super Bowl XXI Toy Story 2 Coprophagia Cheetah Clouded Leopard Combine (Half-Life 2) Late Night with Conan O'Brien Asiatic Golden Cat Canary Ostrich The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Rugby football Polymorphism in object-oriented programming Cincinnati Bengals Land mine Poker jargon Working animal Tiger Anal sex W.

does your cat love you do you think your cat loves you even if you don't think that animals can feel emotion do you want to believe he or she feels a genuine affection for you often we try and humanize our animals and we like to think that they love us the way we love them most mammals are motivated by the same core emotions that humans are motivated by they include fear anger and hunger and the drive to protect their young and or territory the leading theory is that domestic cats and dogs co evolved with humans that is why we get along so well the cats we have domesticated as house pets have very little to worry about they eat on a regular schedule they don't have predators stalking them they have been bred to be content and happy they have been bred to respond to human affection and want to spend time with you they have an uncanny ability to be able to respond to your emotions as a scientist i will say that it is a by product of the co evolution of the two species as a pet owner i will tell you that yes my cat loves me  Dog Human Ferret Emotion Gray Wolf Skunk Domestication Hunting Taboo food and drink Happiness Pet Carnivore Brain Domestic rabbit Motivation Guinea pig Pet skunk Pig German Shepherd Dog Animal communication Extinction Minor Harry Potter Beasts Feral cat Inception of Darwin's theory Cheetah American Alligator Bird Empathy Seabird Working animal Fox hunting Evolution Fancy rat Zoophilia Bat Friendship Kitten Rat Love Aquatic ape hypothesis Hybrid Tasmanian Devil The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Rabbit Tiger Kangaroo Artificial selection Brown Bear Horse Cloning Hamster Island restoration Maison Ikkoku Patriotism Garfield Animal testing Introduced species Socialization Elephant House Mouse Darwin from Orchids to Variation Animal rights Artificial consciousness Kim Possible Biodiversity Feral Lion Anger management Evolutionism Species Fauna of Australia Kakapo Housebreaking Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) The Smoking Room Predation Ren and Stimpy Ecology Meme Biology Transactional analysis Team Rocket Goat Xenomorph Mammal Senescence Snake Dead Like Me Domestication of the horse Alaskan Malamute Hedgehog Evolution of the Horse Altruism Red Dwarf characters Vomiting Cuttlefish

cat at the very start of kidney failure what to expect my year old cat was just found to have elevated creatinine levels other kidney factors in blood test were in normal range after ua showed that her kidneys are not concentrating her urine enough she just had a bladder infection took antibiotics and the infection has cleared her appetite and activity levels are as usual still the vet said the next step is to do a different ua after an overnight fluid restriction to confirm that she her kidneys are not working right then we will put her on k d food if need be so i would like to hear especially from those who have gone through this with their cat what to expect the kinds of things you don't think to ask about in the vet's office my cat is on k d food which i believe is the most amazing thing in the world before this he was losing wait sleeping constantly he had no energy and no will to even eat now he's outside chasing butterflies and even putting on weight the k d food will not hurt a healthy cat and will help massively if the cat does have kidney problems so i'd suggest starting now before you even get the results back my cat has also been taking a tablet called fortekor at mg ask your vet if that would be appropriate it's just a daily pill and fantastic another important thing to ask is if the vet can discover the cause if there is a cause then you also need to be treating that unfortunately my cats illness has no cause so he will be unlikely to live more than years and since he's also only years old this is particularly tragic luckily for you this is often not the case things you might test for include polycystic kidneys and lymphoma water consumption will also go up so it's important to provide enough personally i have given him sources of water one upstairs one downstairs and one outside and he still drinks out of the toilet when he gets the chance due to this she will also need to urinate more so be prepared for the odd accident it's not intentional she really can't help it the most important thing to remember is that your cat can still live out its life normally and without pain if you manage the problem this means a low protein diet proper medication and a lot of water good luck  Kidney Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dieting Prostate cancer Diabetes mellitus Dialysis Pneumonia Folic acid Cancer Insulin Hypertension Guinea pig Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hypoglycemia Fancy rat Cirrhosis Paracetamol Vitamin C Atkins Nutritional Approach Kidney stone Diabetic nephropathy Tocopherol Paget's disease of bone Diabetes insipidus Coeliac disease Group A streptococcal infection Stomach cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Gout Ferret IgA nephropathy Raw food diet Anorexia nervosa Acute renal failure Domestic rabbit Lupus erythematosus Nephrology Obesity Hepatitis Aspartame Veganism Diarrhea Psoriasis Urinary system Tobacco smoking Glycogen storage disease type I Medical analysis of circumcision Blood Theory of conduct Turner syndrome Traumatic brain injury Obstetrics Crohn's disease Multiple sclerosis Sickle-cell disease Colorectal cancer Antiretroviral drug Renal physiology Hyperglycemia Sugar substitute Nephrotic syndrome Acne Water Cat Cytomegalovirus Atherosclerosis Oral contraceptive Bipolar disorder Protein-energy malnutrition Urinary tract infection Menstrual cycle Multiple myeloma Caffeine Polycystic ovary syndrome Low-carbohydrate diet Psychosis Livestock Antibiotic Anemia Common cold Diabetic ketoacidosis Legionellosis Adjustable gastric band Organ transplant Herpes simplex virus Endometriosis

how to get rid of fleas our two cats are ate up with fleas we've given them at least flea baths and got them flea collars but they still have fleas is there anything else that we can do to get rid of the fleas or should we take them to the vet unfortunately i don't know of any cheap or free way to get rid of fleas here are my suggestions it's what works for me i have four kitties and a rottie and live in the country where they go inside and out at will never see a flea i use revolution every month and treat my yard just the acre right around the house not the whole thing i have never had much success with home remedies for consistent flea prevention shampoos and powders kill the fleas on them at the time but don't repel more from jumping on you should try frontline over counter or revolution which usually requires a prescription and be consistent use it once a month the eggs fall off and then hatch in your carpets rugs bedding and furniture you need to go to your local pet store and ask for a spray that is safe for use around your cat and spray the entire house especially where the cats hang out or try a bomb also putting moth balls in your vacuum cleaner bag or canister will help to kill any eggs fleas or larva that are sucked up otherwise they will hatch in the vacuum and crawl out later if the pet goes outside you should also treat your yard i use sevin dust apply just before a rain shower or use a hose or sprinkler to wet the lawn immediately after application if the infestation of the home is too bad you may see persistent fleas and need to treat more than once or call a professional i know it's a lot of work but once you've got them bad it can be expensive to fix also once your cats are flea free if they scratch a lot then they may need to see the vet they can develop a topical or skin infection from digging themselves flea collars should not be used with any other type of topical treatment such as frontline or revolution plus they just don't work well and pose more health risks to the pet than to the fleas good luck to you  Flea Cat Diseases of the honeybee Gypsy moth Fancy rat Bedbug Pet skunk Psoriasis Hamster Guinea pig Acne Malaria Scabies Domestic rabbit Kakapo Rabies Common cold Baylisascaris Heartworm Tungiasis Ascariasis Hazing Siphon Chicken Chinchilla Tuberculosis Glossary of firefighting equipment Minor Harry Potter Beasts Fire extinguisher Plastic Theory of conduct Breastfeeding Red Hot Chili Peppers Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shampoo Ranma __ characters Animal Crossing Strap-on dildo Dog Livestock Herpes simplex virus Autism Chronic fatigue syndrome Richard Chase Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Spidey Super Stories Black Death American Alligator Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sento Bubonic plague Nuclear power Linked list Pediculosis Anthrax Childbirth Zerg Bathing Swimming Candidiasis Hookworm Genericized trademark Dracunculiasis Thermal power station Glossary of American football Tobacco Biological pest control Dandruff Schistosomiasis Eczema Tattoo Bat Solar power Clothing Garfield Otitis externa Wildfire Dairy Hydrotherapy Egg (food) Crab louse Hay fever Combine (Half-Life 2) Smallpox Upholstery Tooth enamel Vampire Beetle Vacuum Domestic AC power plugs and sockets

kitten comments and advice still nursing at months my month old bengal is a little strange he insists on nursing on my arm and if i try to make him stop he cries and whines about it he was with his mom until he was weeks she went into heat and her milk made the kittens sick so they were taken away weeks early kaidyn also insists he has to go everywhere with me he rides in the baby stroller walks on a harness and even likes car rides he even takes showers with me his favorite thing though is to sit in the baby swing and swing he even knows how to turn it on by himself i also have kaidyn's sister kianna and she is a perfectly normal cat she likes being held but doesn't insist on it all the time she seems normal compared to her brother i'm worried kaidyn may freak out when i go on vacation next month for weeks and i would love for him to be more independant than he is the cats won't be alone but they will be staying with someone other than me taking them is not possible any advice on kaidyn what you're getting here is anxiety from your cat self soothing behaviors being weaned at weeks of age is pretty good for a cat and if as you say you have his sister and she doesn't exhibit the same behaviors then kaidyn has bonded strongly to you and placed you very firmly in his mom's place and doesn't want to let go of his 'kitten role' some don't and always seem to want to keep a bit of the kitten behavior i have a female that still does the head nudges to my arm or shoulder when she wants pets like she would to her mom to get her to let the milk down it's just something that zuni does but if i don't let her or can't sit still for her to be petted she doesn't come unglued here is the problem with your kitty and quite honestly i see that part of the problem is probably coming from you for allowing it i don't mean to be harsh but if you allow him to go everywhere with you in a baby stroller car etc you have taught him that he is in fact your 'baby' and allowed to be part of your life in all aspects the coming vacation time will be very difficult for him starting right now begin to separate yourself from kaidyn more giving him more time with his sister and less time with you if he becomes aggitated there are products that will give some relief that are perfectly safe and natural such as bach's flower remedies try rescue remedy for anxiety you can find it on the internet to purchase in a number of places and it's usually available at most health food stores also prices vary so choose the ones that fit your budget there are others of his products that will help too when kaidyn wants to nurse give him some pets and love but firmly remove him from the nursing position and if you must set him down with some more pets walk away if you must give him some rescue remedy if he becomes upset directions and information are on website http www bachcentre com centre rescue htm and work hard to help him get more independent before you leave on vacation if you do take him with you on a walk or a car trip take kianna with you also don't make him the 'special one' but i truly think it might be best to stop that for a bit until after the vacation just try to wean yourself and kaidyn from each other and i'm sure things will work out would you mind giving an update later on i'd be curious to see how things work out good luck  Breastfeeding Cat Dog training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) RuneScape quests Garfield Shaggy dog story Pet skunk Phoebe Buffay's songs Milton H.

how to convince my parents to get a kitten i was wondering what do you think i can do to convince my parents to get another kitten we have this cat about or they hate her they say all she does is sleep and eat and they hate how her litter smells everyday when they clean it still lol they just wanna give her away lol but were not but i want another kitten i love them there so cute but how can i convince them to get another cat with twice the smell and junk and the litter and all lol and also i do nothing for the cat but sometimes give it water lol but besides giving her food and im not cleaning poo what can i do to convince them to get one news is giving them away too we can call help please i will raise the kitten too lol btw im only yr old well i know this is not the answer you want to hear but if you are not willing to take care of the cat you have this is not the right time for you to get another one pets are a big responsibility and taking care of them properly takes effort they depend on us for everything they will suffer and die if we do not give them the things they need like fresh water nutritious food a clean litter box a safe place to sleep and vet care cleaning poo is a part of having pets as long as you have an animal there will be poo to clean up i think the only way you would convince your parents to let you have another pet is to show them you are responsible enough to take care of the one you have and to show them that you love her enough to take care of her you also need to remember that cats do not always like new cats coming to their homes yours might not accept a new one she might fight and hurt the new kitten never get a pet because you think if you get tired of it or it becomes too much trouble you will just give it away that's really not fair to the animal  Hamster Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Garfield Cat Kitten Ferret Fancy rat Ron and Fez Fruits Basket Azumanga Daioh Socialization Dog Feral cat Animal communication Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sin City Social rule Pet W.I.T.C.H.

how do i stop my month old kitten from nursing i really think he's too old for it he's going to be an outside cat once he's old enough to be fixed but if there's anything i can do to stop him now i'd like to try it oh also the mom is trying to stop him sometimes but not often enough for him to take the hint i think it may be because we gave all of her other kittens away and she's lonely or bored hmmm well maybe this sounds wierd but put vinegar on belly or lemon juice so that when he tries to nurse he wont b c of the taste i know vinegar stops cats from chewing on cords ao maybe try that it's safe for the mom cat too you dont want to pull him off b c he might show hostility towards you when he doesnt understand that he cant do that anymore well goodluck you shouldnt use a spray bottle b c it will upset the mom too if he jumps off quickly or if you accidently spray her milk is a bad idea you are never sappose to give a cat milk regardless of the age unless you want to clean up some nasty messes  Cat RuneScape quests Atomic Kitten Vinegar Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Kitten The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Pet skunk Breastfeeding Garfield Ron and Fez Social rule Vitasoy Cheese Toilet humour Shaggy dog story Great Teacher Onizuka Pok__mon Live!

worried about health of year old cat i have a year old cat named angelo he is about pounds but not really fat he's been the same size since age the vet always says he is healthy and i keep him indoors so i only take him for shots every years i also have female cats who are both up to date on shots more recent adoptions about a month ago i noticed a small sore on the outer lower corner of his mouth closer to the chin it looks like a rugburn on a human would it's not swollen it doesn't look infected mostly just dried blood and not even a lot of that i thought he got in a fight with one of the girls although they are declawed in front i've noticed that the sore is slightly bigger and now has spread under his chin not to the mouth or gums though no wounds or punctures again just dried blood i clean it with warm water i haven't seen him eating dry food lately but he will eat wet food he also seems to have lost a few pounds i'm taking him to the vet next week any ideas hi again no change in food or toys i know he's not happy about the most recent addition to the family though i'm not an expert but it also sounds to me like he may have gotten scratched that's the area where acne develops but that looks like dirt not dried blood because it's spreading i would get him to the vet you just never know and if it's something serious you may be able to catch it before it gets bad regarding the food he may be losing weight because of eating canned food even inferior brands of canned food are less fattening than dry foods as for why he's made a switch i'm not sure have you always offered dry and wet or is the addition of wet something new if that's the case it may just be that he likes it better if not he may have switched because his teeth are bothering him something else for the vet to check on or just because he's a cat and they do odd things sometimes but the fact that you can see the weight loss might mean he's losing too quickly yet another reason for a vet checkup good luck  Cat Pet skunk Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Garfield Fancy rat Ferret Hamster Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Guinea pig Atkins Nutritional Approach Acne Chocolate Dieting The Fairly OddParents Dog Oral sex Tooth Puberty Tire Stomach cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) First aid Anorexia nervosa Tooth enamel Vegetarianism Mouth ulcer 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Shining (film) Folic acid Prostate cancer Super Size Me Chinchilla Equine conformation Obesity Jam (TV series) Diving suit Nutrition Salad Fingers Tobacco American Alligator Snake The Inside Taboo food and drink Weight training Herpes simplex virus Sin City FoxTrot Ron Weasley Shark Ed, Edd n Eddy M16 (rifle) Computer virus One Piece minor characters Livestock Piccolo Junior Saga Dental caries Cocaine Ramen Happy Tree Friends Akatsuki (Naruto) Carbon dioxide Crohn's disease Kodocha Group A streptococcal infection Adjustable gastric band Hamburger Cheese Dialysis Toxoplasmosis Characters of Naruto Hypoglycemia Ebola Tofu Kakapo Menstrual cup Great White Shark Bodybuilding Comfrey Violin Garlic Milk Tocopherol Traumatic brain injury Coffee Macular degeneration

cat wakes me up in the middle of the night i have an yo cat who was neutered when he was he is a rescue cat and was in a home at first and then on the streets for a few months before being rescued he is noisy which i can live with but he wakes me up in the middle of the night scratching and miaowing at the door he wants to be outdoors i try to ignore him but he goes quiet for a while and then starts up again i have tried waiting until he is quiet before i let him out of the room but it hasnt stopped the behaviour sleeping on my bed is not really an option because i am allergic to cats and i still would not get much sleep he still thinks he is a tom cat and yells and sings which is driving me crazy he wants to be outdoors spraying fighting other cats and roaming which is not safe how can i get him used to being indoors it has been three months now and his behaviour is no better than at the start when i tried converting him to being inside hmmm i sure know what you mean i have cats at night when i check the roll for cats accounted for before i go to bed cats should be inside and outside princess will stay in occasionally but i know that when i have just fallen to sleep she will come and will rattle the blinds on the window just above my head and she will growl a very low growl almost too low for a cat but it is her and she is in a panic to go outside she won't be put off for any length of time either or she will knock things off of my dresser to get my attention and then return to rattling my blinds who can sleep i must get up and let her out it sounds like you will have to give in and accept that your cat wants to be out at night it was hard for me at first but then i was getting no sleep she won i have a male cat socks who may stay in some nights or may go out some nights but it is his choice for almost the same reasons as for princess you will have to give and take with your cat sort of like a person some cats just have stronger personalities i bet he will win would sure like to know later when you have had more time to tame him to the indoors but months should tell the tale i am betting  Cat Shaggy dog story Sin City Dog training Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Fire fighting Dog The Time Machine Silent Night, Deadly Night Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Housebreaking Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Amber Spyglass Milton H.

what is the best canned cat food for a cat who no longer has any teeth my cat just had teeth removed and he can no longer eat hard food plz help thanks there are many good brands of canned food out there you can look through the what to feed list all are good brands and if a website is listed for the food chances are that they'll have a store locator so you can find where they're sold in your area one other brand not mentioned in there is by nature organics i think this is one of the very best because it's grainless has very few ingredients and is low cal too if your cat doesn't like any of those brands you can also look through the information on how to choose a good food edit also you can make any canned food mushier softer by adding a little bit of water to it and mixing it in the extra water is good for the digestion as well  Hamster Tofu Tooth Soft drink Chocolate Kosher foods Sewage treatment Alcoholic beverage Cat Mattress Tooth enamel Food Cheese Hydrochloric acid Organic food Chewing gum Guinea pig Food preservation Domestic rabbit Ramen Inventory Chili con carne Milk Drill bit MP3 Cat food Pepsi-Cola In-N-Out Burger Sauerkraut Dim sum Genetically modified food Hydrogen peroxide Laundry detergent Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Sushi Fugu Beer Bread Hot dog The Coca-Cola Company Soy milk Pump It Up Coffee Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Digestion Fecal incontinence Cigarette Gastrointestinal tract Dairy Toothpaste Diarrhea Peanut butter Ice cream Carnivore Breastfeeding Fancy rat Tesco Fish and chips American Black Bear Nutrition Sucrose Dietary fiber Stomach cancer Gasoline Food storage Evidence of evolution Honey Ferret Mayonnaise Vomiting Guinness Felis sapiens Kitchen Livestock Raw food diet French cuisine Seabird Coca-Cola Apple Fishing Dental caries Anchovy Waste management Biscuit Campbell Soup Company Salmon Minestrone ConAgra Foods, Inc.

inside cats and outside cats in usa i read lots of questions about 'inside' and 'outside' cats and i have to assume all these are asked by americans because i've never heard of an 'inside' cat as in one that isn't allowed out in the uk unless it was seriously ill everybody's cat here goes in and out of the house as it likes except for a few outside farm cats can somebody explain why so many americans feel they need to keep their cat in the house all its life please fortunately in the uk rabies is non existent and there are no natural predators of cats so it has always been considered relatively safe to allow cats outside provided they are vaccinated and spayed neutered it's estimated that of cats have regular access to go outside if they want to this practice is widely advocated by vets and animal welfare shelters alike in fact many animal welfare organisations won't allow you to adopt a cat unless it has access to a garden many cats have a litter tray even though they are allowed outside because it saves on confrontations with neighbours and cats are often kept indoors over night as that is when they are most at risk from cars in north america the situation is reversed quirkyblonde has given you a good explanation of the many hazards that cats in areas of north america face in those locations it isn't in a cat's best interest to let them outdoors some animal shelters also have a policy of of not allowing people to adopt cats unless they guarantee to keep them indoors many owners put a lot of effort into providing their cat with a physically and mentally stimulating indoor environment to compensate for not being allowed outside however certain aspects of a cat's natural behaviour such as scratching often leads to them being declawed by less enlightened owners it's already illegal to do this in many countries i just i wish that it were illegal everywhere in america it is claimed that indoor cats live twice as long as outdoor cats although no one has yet produced enough statistical evidence to support this claim beyond doubt neutered cats live longer and house pets are more likely to be neutered than feral cats but this longevity difference is due to neutering not to indoor living there are literally millions of cat owners in the uk who can testify to having cats who lived well into their mid teens or early twenties even feral cats have been recorded as old as so it would appear that the uk outdoor environment is definitely a much safer one for cats than it is in america one factor influencing the indoor outdoor statistics is the number of moggies and pedigree cats in the uk it is thought that only of pet cats are pedigree cats a figure which appears to correspond to the number of indoor cats far more american pet cats are pedigreed which contributes to the indoor only philosophy sarah hartwell has written several articles on the indoor outdoor cat debate and the cultural differences between the uk and america for keeping cats they make interesting reading http www messybeast com indooroutdoor htm http www messybeast com catsusuk htm  Feral cat Pet skunk Dog Ferret Organic farming Socialization Guinea pig Capitalism Manx (cat) Livestock Extreme Programming Insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Animal rights Housebreaking Tobacco smoking Fox hunting Fancy rat Fathers' rights Autism Domestication Democracy Conservatism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Psychology Economics Zoophilia Nudism Theory of conduct Sigmund Freud Kitten Unemployment Peter Singer Abortion debate Whaling Intelligence quotient Animal shelter Life insurance Sociocultural evolution Altruism Intelligent design movement Garfield Infantilism Agriculture Rabies Ethics Microchip implant (animal) Colonial mentality Psychiatric hospital Divorce Sexual orientation Pitaten Meme Economic inequality Bulgarian language Swimming pool Religion DDT Baseball Light-emitting diode Domestic violence Intelligent design Determinism Health insurance Nuclear power Animal euthanasia Liberalism Homeopathy Creation-evolution controversy Constitution of Ireland Science Happiness Objectivist philosophy Crime prevention through environmental design Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Wealth Scientology beliefs and practices Luck Microeconomics Cognitive science Human nature Gun politics in the United States Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Social justice

how to make a cat like you let the cat come to you dont make sudden movements or noise wait until the cat is in a relaxed and tired mood dont pick the cat up try to encourage him with treats normally the cat is closest to who feeds it dont stare or look straight into its eyes this is treatening when you look at the cat look over its head or beside it not straight at it and yawn these are friendly gestures to a cat when allowed gently stroke behing the head and neck and put the back of your hand against his whiskers and gently move your hand up the side of his face dont even try to stoke his belly unless he invites you and then with extreme caution as cats are very protective of this vulnerable area and cant help but turn on you suddenly for taking advantage hope this helps give it time try ignoring him and see what happens  Cat Professional wrestling throws Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story Diving Dog training Dai shogi Suplex Social rule Breastfeeding Maka dai dai shogi Professional wrestling slang Parade (military) Taikyoku shogi Tai shogi Kakapo Breaststroke Dai dai shogi Equine conformation Backstroke Salute Conspiracy (TNG episode) Professional wrestling holds Animal communication Gray Wolf Violin Poker jargon Cannon shogi Reflexology Norway national football team Drowning Mickey Mouse Traumatic brain injury Swingout Stroke Punt (boat) RuneScape quests Eye contact Conducting Tom and Jerry (MGM) Tenjiku shogi Fancy rat Snooker Skin of Evil (TNG episode) Casualty lifting Sin City Judkins shogi Customs and etiquette of Japan Boxing Tasmanian Devil Canoe Piledriver (professional wrestling) Care Bears The Amber Spyglass Tank Red Dwarf characters Guinea pig Shogi Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cheetah Front crawl Characters in the Smurfs Domestic rabbit Jam (TV series) Fast bowling Brown Bear Xiaolin Showdown Dog Strap-on dildo Kasparov versus The World Bicycle American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Massage Wa shogi Darth Revan Horse Vehicular cycling Milton H.

covered litter box problems i've had my cat for about months she was stray abandoned she took to using a litter box without any trouble which was really nice we started with a standard inch deep tray she threw litter everywhere when she'd dig so i got a covered one everything was fine until recently suddenly she seemed to stop covering her twosies and she had a tendency to come flying out of the litterbox afterwards the smell would eventually drift through the rest of the house and i'd have to go cover it myself we moved months ago and she's put on some weight it's hotter than where we used to live so she's less active and i thought maybe she didn't have enough room in there anymore i took the cover off and she immediately resumed covering her waste like always we use crystals now instead of clumping litter so there is less for her to kick out anyone else have trouble using covered boxes do cats really like the cover or is it just humans projecting modesty onto them no i never was able to use the flap that came with it she refused to push her little head through lol it's a human thing cats do not naturally go into caves to eliminate many cats some of mine included are afraid of covered litter boxes one won't use it under any circumstances and the other will but rushes out as quickly as possible leaving everything unburied just like your cat does another factor is the scented litter box fillers lots of cats hate the smell which is even more concentrated in a covered box i find it easier to use an uncovered litter box and fill it with a good quality litter than controls odor well i find that odor lockers works well  Cat Piccolo Junior Saga Domestic rabbit RuneScape quests Cat litter 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sulfur Fancy rat Eddie Guerrero Tobacco smoking Pollution Feral cat Hamster Mattress Albatross Kakapo The Contender (television series) Kurt Cobain Olfaction Dog Guinea pig Operation Market Garden Shen Gong Wu The Amber Spyglass Welding Vermicompost Semiconductor device Escape from New York Pok__mon Live!

why does my kitten do this when my kitten is around his food he scrapes the mat and carpet surrounding it like cats do when they're burying their business in the litter tray what's this about and why does he do it around his food bowl incidentally his litter tray is the other side of the house from his food and he has no problems using it he does like his food he wolfs it down quick enough lots of cats do this i think it's a version of the way big cats in the wild will hide a partially eaten kill to keep other animals from finding it before they return to finish it off housecat translation that was really tasty i'm full right now but i want to save some for later so i'll hide it if only i could get this linoleum floor to cooperate  Cat Kitten Ferret Fancy rat Feral cat Domestic rabbit Hamster Manx (cat) Guinea pig Japanese tea ceremony Feral Garfield RuneScape quests Japanese cuisine Brown Bear Cheetah Dog Puma Plastic Gray Wolf Pet skunk Vermicompost Professional wrestling throws Shannara creatures Ralston Purina Company Socialization Hedgehog Comanche Toilet humour Asiatic Golden Cat Livestock Rabbit The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Neko the Kitty Tokyo Mew Mew Internet phenomenon Red Fox Treecat SimAnt Domestication Pitaten Biblical scientific foresight Bulk vending Leopard Cat Serval Pig Boggle Red Squirrel Squirrel Linoleum Magical objects in Harry Potter Mercury Cougar Tiger Raw food diet Hydroponics Cat litter Chinchilla European Rabbit Poker jargon Bengal cat Hunting Orca Barbecue McDonald's Sluggy Freelance Carnivore Pacific, Missouri Animal rights Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Bat Professional wrestling attacks Cuisine of Denmark Badly Drawn Kitties Clouded Leopard Barry Horne RuneScape locations Phantom cat Idli Meat Silly Symphonies Basement House Mouse Turkish Van Animal communication Hannibal Lecter Leather Tooth enamel The Legend of Zelda series enemies Spider Professional wrestling match types Big Brother UK series 5 Acorn Girly Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Coprophagia Sonic & Knuckles Razorback Wallpaper group Black panther

should cats be given milk or diary prdoducts my cats enjoy an occasional swig of milk or even an occasional swig of half and half this does not seem to bother their digestive systems at all i do realize that for babies that can not drink milk or tolerate diary products it is because of a hard to digest casin ingredient how strict are you other cat owners on giving your kitties an occasional drink of milk i have one cat of my cats that actually goes to the refigerator and begs for milk she doesn't do this all of the time though hi everything in moderation as the greeks once said i'd check the cat stool and if your not seeing diarrhea black and tarry stuff straining but no stool or hard and crumbly stool then the cat is not allergic and you can go on without guilt many farm cats will drink milk straight from the udder and if both parents drink cow milk the kittens usually though not always acquire the enzymes to digest it from their mama's milk the proof will be in the litter box so check it regularly and if all is good there your milk loving lactose tolerant kitties are just fine  Milk Lactose intolerance Dairy Breastfeeding Cat Diarrhea Food allergy Soy milk Coeliac disease Guinea pig Kitten Vegetarianism Breast milk Chocolate Escherichia coli O157:H7 Yoghurt Veganism Nestl__ Kosher foods Coffee Raw milk Urinary incontinence Pet skunk Badly Drawn Kitties Food Dietary fiber Dairy farming Hypoglycemia Feces Poker jargon Hamster Garfield Hello Kitty Taboo food and drink Domestic goat Flatulence Enzyme Domestic rabbit Soft drink Laxative Gastrointestinal tract Trailer Park Boys Pasteurization Alcoholic beverage Crohn's disease Infant formula Lac operon The Super Milk-chan Show Dairy cattle RuneScape quests Andy Warhol Manx (cat) Little Britain Sugar Elephant Cat litter Irritable bowel syndrome Entamoeba histolytica Tofu Dairy product Allergy Eric Cartman Healthy eating Kashrut Friends Alcoholics Anonymous Domestication Glycogen storage disease type I Insulin Shaggy dog story Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Ferret Constipation Peanut Mammary gland B3ta Pitaten Antiretroviral drug Achewood Fancy rat Diverticulosis Tooth Kodocha Digestion Ice cream Feline leukemia virus Dr. Seuss Gastroesophageal reflux disease Rocko's Modern Life Condensed milk Bubble tea Dim sum Cats (musical) House music Hera Hemorrhoid Phoebe Buffay's songs

only for cat owners my mom is having a problem with her cat her cat is a female shes years old about year ago my mom had to incorporate my brother's cat into the household my brother could no longer keep his cat in his house so he gave it to my mom its been a year now and the year old cat has been peeing all over the house i know it has to do with territorial issues the other cat is not at all hostile or peeing my mom doesn't know what to do i volunteered to keep her cat at my house to see how she does my mom can't give the other cat away because my brother would probably get pretty upset even though i think she should get rid of the younger cat do you think she'll pee all over my house i have no pets i would appreciate serious answers there is no way i can take my brother's cat lets just say we are not on speaking terms i meant to tell you that the other cat is years old and shes a female my mom's cat had her own litter box but she has stopped using it cause the younger cat uses both litter boxes there are no guarantees but it seems clearly to be a territorial issue i assume there are two litter boxes as that is almost a necessity i would guess if you took her she would not pee but take one of the litter boxes that she uses and don't clean it take the litter that is in it that way in her new surroundings she will immediately know where the litter box is and recognize that she has used that litter box there may be some accidents at first as sometimes a move can be very stressful cats hate changes and sometimes react strongly but since the situation you have described has been going on for some time it is likely not to change as long as both of them are together by the way my response is predicated on there being no medical issue with the older cat you want that looked into before making any specific plans at the cat could also be showing signs of senility and yes that happens  Cat Dog Pet skunk Calvin and Hobbes Domestic rabbit Philosophy of language Kurt Cobain Garfield Manx (cat) Recurring South Park characters The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Shaggy dog story Friends Phoebe Buffay's songs Ren and Stimpy Hamster The Fairly OddParents Fancy rat Guinea pig Tobacco smoking Pitaten Prolog Life insurance The Adventures of Pete & Pete Bill Clinton Democracy The Subtle Knife Cindy Sheehan House Mouse Kim Possible Theory of conduct Litter Arab-Israeli conflict Cat litter Kyle Broflovski Continuation War Public-key cryptography Recurring characters of Futurama Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Schr__dinger's cat Red Dwarf characters Social rule Feral cat Whose Line Is It Anyway?

is there a limit to how often cats and kittens can get baths is it possible to bathe cats too often is weeks apart too much i have a four month old kitten that always wants to get in the bath with me how often can i shampoo him you shouldn't bathe them too often cats generally do a pretty good job of keeping themselves clean i bathe mine few times a year if you wash all the oils off you can dry out their skin and make the hair more brittle but there's a difference between bathing and swimming swimming doesn't involve the scrubbing and rinsing so if your kitten likes to swim i guess you can let him occasionally but don't let the soap water get in his eyes or ears  Sento Shampoo Soap Cat Psoriasis Social rule Kitten Otitis externa Diving Car washing techniques Manicure Dandruff Swimsuit Body piercing Hard water Wok Atomic Kitten Japanese toilet Turkish Van Menstrual cup Customs and etiquette of Japan Eczema Ranma __ characters Hand washing Bathing Sauna Textile manufacturing Manx (cat) Swimming pool Fruits Basket Phoebe Buffay's songs Cleanser Fecal incontinence Minor Harry Potter Beasts Swimming Washing machine Acne Leather Lynx Pitaten Urticaria Garfield Through the Looking-Glass Baptism Cats (musical) Dry cleaning Socialization Tokyo Mew Mew Thermoregulation Friends Dishwashing Dishwasher Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Turkish Angora Washroom Ferret Hydrotherapy Little Britain Catarrh RuneScape quests Feral cat Cast iron Niddah Skin Azumanga Daioh Tenchi Muyo!

why is my kitten moaning he is usually playful and very active and cuddley today and yesterday he is laying around and whenever someone even goes to pet him he moans even if he isnt touched he is not eating either please help ugh sorry to hear this yes you should probably take him to a vet if he's not moving at all getting up walking about then there's a good chance he's suffering from related issues from one of the common diseases like feline leukemia or kitty aids if not treated your kitten will probably suffer kidney failure or some other catastrophic system shutdown and die it is possible of course he's suffered an injury and taking him to your vet would be the thing to do their too we've fostered hundreds of strays and we lose a lot of kittens to this stuff it's the most dangerous time for them if he survives to six months cats can usually live a happy long life with proper medical care if this cat is a stray hasn't had shots or been checked or is from a stray then definitely get him checked even if he isn't it's still possible the visit and diagnosis shouldn't run more than and then you can decide what to do but please do something if it is the above he'll suffer greatly for many hours before he dies  Cat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pet skunk Garfield Kitten Rabies Medicine Guinea pig Tuberculosis Fancy rat Cats (musical) Leukemia Socialization Diabetes mellitus Triage Urinary incontinence Traumatic brain injury Heartworm Aortic dissection Theory of conduct Myocardial infarction Prostate cancer First aid Terri Schiavo Kodocha Phoebe Buffay's songs Stomach cancer Atomic Kitten Puma Blood (computer game) Anorexia nervosa Stroke Veterinarian Paget's disease of bone Pneumonia Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Smoking Room AIDS Joy Division (band) Pitaten Escape from New York Equine conformation Cancer Growth hormone treatment Duesberg hypothesis Feline leukemia virus Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hip fracture Domestic rabbit Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder National Institutes of Health Hamster Folic acid Asthma Chronic fatigue syndrome Abu Dhabi Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hypertension Catscratch Cirrhosis Abortion debate Marc Antony and Pussyfoot Kidney Animal euthanasia Lupus erythematosus Little Britain Malignant melanoma Terri Schiavo timeline Shaggy dog story The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Radiation poisoning Epilepsy Girly John F.

how do you determine the sex of your kitten i own three kittens which i recently received from a neighbor i don't have any experience with kittens i am still confused about the sex of the three i don't want to take them to the vet yet because they are too young it might be hard te tell if you're inexperienced in this escpecially if all the kittens happen to be the same sex and you can't compare with the boys there is more space between the anus and the peeing hole which is just a little round hole the space is where the balls will be and there is hair in that space with girls the openings are much closer together the space between the holes is hairless in small kittens and the vulva the hole furthest away from the tail has the shape of a small vertical stripe if you still can't tell most vets can good luck with your new babies  Ferret Strap-on dildo Toilet humour Kitten Atomic Kitten Oral sex Vulva Ron and Fez Cat Phoebe Buffay's songs Goatse.cx Garfield Guinea pig Golf RuneScape quests Anal sex Girly Puberty Black hole Gay slang Sex toy Cetacea Fancy rat Poker jargon Rolling-element bearing House Mouse Hamster Pubic hair Violin Hair (musical) Buttocks Japanese toilet Randomness Something Positive Pinball Hair Platypus Doug Terminal ballistics Humphrey Bogart El Goonish Shive Masturbation Knife Archery The Marshall Mathers LP Curling Triple J Hottest 100, 2003 Equine conformation Dog Catgirl Drill bit Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Eric Cartman Herpes simplex virus Glossary of nautical terms Internal ballistics AFI 100 Years series Condom Professional wrestling throws Sex organ Manx (cat) Comanche General relativity Piccolo Junior Saga Firearm Leaf Amateur astronomy Human American football strategy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Chess strategy and tactics Light-emitting diode The Beach Boys Sexual differentiation Skateboarding trick Female genital cutting Transsexuality The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Prostate cancer Squirrel Gravity Kenny McCormick Penis Cats (musical) Redundant array of independent disks Hogwarts Floor Directory The Championships, Wimbledon Elevator Caving Frankie Laine Big Brother UK series 5 Bike lane debate Milton H.

regarding the issue of declawing a kitten cat train the kitten not to scratch furniture or other unwanted objects by directing it to a scratching post with catnip spraying it with a water bottle etc but what about when you are not home and the kitten is scratching the furniture how do you redirect the behavior then i do not like it but i will probably get my kitten declawed because i cannot guarantee my fianc that our new kitten will not scratch the furnative the argument against that it takes away their nature defenses against predators is void b c my kitten is an indoor one and will not go outside this is an invitation for suggestions opinions on the subject the decision to declaw has not been made lightly but rather through a lot of research i would like to have some feedback from both sides cat owners who have declawed cats how is their behavior did it change after the surgery do you regret getting it done those who refuse to declaw how do you keep your cat from scratching unwanted objects are you at home all the time what do you do when you are away at work i'll try to play the devil's advocate here in my apartment we have a year old declawed cat and my new almost month old kitten i have toyed around with the idea of declawing but my hesitation has nothing to do with it taking away their natural defenses like your cat mine will be strictly indoors i have asked my roommate about her cats declawing experience and she said she didn't seem traumatized by it much that it was only days before she could switch back to using regular litter she used paper shreddings in the interim so that the litter didn't clump in her scabs really in the area where the surgery takes place she did say with a family cat they ended up getting the back feet declawed as well and there was a definite difference in the behavior of the cat afterwards almost a sort of depression and a complete in the way the cat behaved or acted so it was sort of traumatized by it i have also researched alternatives i wouldn't want to spend the constant money on the soft paw caps it just seems like a waste and we've tried that on family cats before and they never last as long as they claim our cats would bite chew whatever to get them off however i clip my kittens claws on a regular basis those things are never more than nubs and as a result he's never really been able to start clawing my furniture in fact he can barely jump up on it because he has no claws to grip into the fabric he usually just slides down or falls now if a cat is scratching religiously in one area i've been told that taping aluminum foil while ugly and annoying on the area for a period of weeks will stop the cat from scratching there they hate the feel of it think putting an old e battery on your tongue sort of feeling my roommate absolutely didn't regret doing the surgery but here's the thing i have two separate friends who both work in two different vet clinics one of the clinics has completely refused to continue declawing the other one will only agree to do it once consulting with the owner and offering plenty of other alternatives the vet there does it but he's stated repeatedly how much he wishes he could make the owners watch the declawing being done or watch a declawing being done first before making the decision the literally cut the entire first joint of the digit off of the toe while not all declaws result in complications a large majority of them suffer from excessive bleeding or complications with the claw continuing to grow despite the joint being removed and then when it does grow it grows in all deformed can grow back into the foot etc and require additional corrective surgeries to fix it but if it is seriously something you desire i would definitely get it done sooner than later much like surgery on children vs adults less pyschological impact if they're babies when it takes place just be prepared here is an article specifically asking not to declaw http images google com imgres imgurl http chitchatcats com images declaw jpg imgrefurl http chitchatcats com declaw php h w sz hl en start um tbnid xjc wt icotm tbnh tbnw prev images fq dkitten bdeclaw ndsp d svnum d um d hl den sa dn i had a tough time finding anything that was really pro declaw but here's a forum string with information http www piftails com forum upload showthread php t what i make sure with my kitten is that the only scratching items i provide are sisal rope and not carpet if you give them carpet to scratch how the heck can they really distinguish from what's okay carpet fabric to scratch since giving my kitten the sisal rope scratching board he has only scratched on that infact he has never once even attempted to scratch the furniture but he's also only

what human food can i feed my sick cat i am unable to get my cat his blue select brand top of the line at petco and petsmart cat food for a few days he has been throwing up pro plan for two days and now is throwing up yellow stomach bile i gave him a few droppers of water which seems to have calmed his stomach a bit i do not want to give him anymore cat food that he cannot tolerate what human food can i make give him that will be good for his stomach thank you for your help oh and does anyone know of something i can use from around the house to clean the stomach bile out of the carpet thanks again hi has your cat been passing any stool if so what does it look like if the stool is black and tar like take him to the vet now if it is dry and crumbly also a vet call as he's dangerously dehydrated if vomiting or no stool persists for two more days please take your cat to the vet to rule out an intestinal blockage cats dehydrate extremely easy and the unfamiliar food may have lead to a dangerous case of constipation cats need more taurine less carbs and more protein than dogs people or other pets do i would get the standard cat hairball remedy boil up some diced chicken thighs complete with the skin mix liberally and dose him on water for the next three days keep him in a quiet and comfortable place and check his litterbox faithfully no milk and no veggies pasta wheat products or salty stuff cats like water with flavor in it or alternately they like to drink it running straight from the tap if your cat is into the flavored water give him a small amount of the chicken broth from the thighs you boiled if he is a tap drinker then put him in the bathroom with the tap constantly running in a tiny stream either way you really want him to drink lots of water in closing many cats especially the very young or very old ones do not handle abrupt changes in their diet so well if the food is too expensive or tends to be chronically understocked i'd buy the desirable food find a more affordable or more available brand that has the closest ingredients list match as possible with the first brand and gradually wean him onto the new food by slowly mixing the new stuff in increasing portions with the preferred food he should be completely weaned onto the new stuff in about a month no sooner remember when you compare the ingredients that the order in which the ingredients appear is just as important as what the ingredients are you will unlikely find an exact match but you can come really close with a little perseverance remember that there are also a number of smaller local retail feed stores in your area that will likely carry your brand for a lot less bucks and a lot more quantity as for the kitty vomit i've had a lot of luck with a product called kids 'n' pets it's a five star rated enzymatic cleaner that is safe for everyone and no allergic reactions from anyone in my home i wish you and your kitty the best  Breastfeeding Hamster Fancy rat Fecal incontinence Stomach cancer Food Diarrhea Dietary fiber Tofu Chocolate Ice cream Ramen Brewery Coeliac disease Paracetamol Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Adjustable gastric band Japanese cuisine Dog Pasta Domestic rabbit Urinary incontinence Healthy eating Beer Dairy Guinea pig Insulin Lactose intolerance Crohn's disease Cirrhosis Ferret Pet skunk Livestock Sulfuric acid Allergy Chicken Tocopherol German cuisine Kosher foods Soy milk Aspartame Veganism Alcoholic beverage Tooth enamel Mountain Dew Vegetarianism Food allergy Dehydration Kitten Kashrut Cuisine of Brazil Cantonese cuisine Aerial (dance move) Kitchen Potato Russian cuisine Poker jargon Omega-3 fatty acid Water Plastic Chili con carne Sugar Cheese Foodborne illness Taboo food and drink Microeconomics Hormone replacement therapy (trans) In-N-Out Burger Hydrogen peroxide Milk Sento Enzyme Domestication Animal testing Barbecue Vitamin C Raw food diet Botulism Coca-Cola Cuisine of Denmark Jewish cuisine Ammonia Chicken soup Fugu Egg (food) Aloe Illegal drug trade Cuisine of the Philippines Garfield Roman eating and drinking Gastroparesis

where does your cat sleep at night my boyfriend and i had a bit of a debate the other day because he keeps his cat outside all night whereas i feel better keeping mine indoors overnight he says it's not fair to keep a cat cooped up like that since it wants to be outside plus he says if his cat stays inside it wakes him up every ten minutes but i say it's not safe for the cat to be out all night he told me it's no less safe then it being out in the daytime since i do let my cats in and out during the day well except for one she's just an indoor kitty i dunno what do you guys think and how do you do things with your own cats lol these answers are so fun to read because i can relate to so many of them my cats like to try and force their way under my blankets and we do have one that's terrified to go outside my kitty sleeps with me on my bed and one of my cats has tried to sleep on my face a few times and we did sadly have a cat get out and get eaten by a coyote and another cat got out and was hit by a car all the more reason i feel secure having them in anyways carry on i have both indoor and outdoor sleepers for the most part i round the indoor outdoor kitties in for the night there are two cats however that never come insides barn cats they can't live in the house due to urination problems or the fact that they hate other cats but they both sleep in the barn where they have cat beds it is safer for the cat to be indoors because large predators come out at night foxes racoons coyotes wolves in certain areas mountain lions and bears now bears and wolves are less likely to eat your cats but the rest of the listed predators are usually the culprits domestic cats are just that domestic they were bred for companionship and showy colors they retain a lot of their predator wild instincts as we all do but for the most part it is a shallow base of instincts i'm sure you've experienced where your indoor outdoor kitty will kill a mouse or almost kill a lizard and do nothing but play with it never eat it the instinct is to catch something moving fast not to necesarily kill it properly or eat it by expecting domestic cats to respond to their environment like a savvy wild cat you are giving them more credit than their breeding and in most times their upbringing cats raised in the home and let out with older cats once in a while until they're old enough is not a full on boot camp into surviving outside like they might have gotten where they feral or wild there are some cats that just can't be inside ferals for instance and in different cases random personality types but most animal rescuers agree if you are going to take the danger of letting your animal outside you should at least bring them in before dusk when the predators wake up to hunt and fat cats shouldn't be outside long anyway most cats raised in an indoor only environment never are even curious about the outdoors they may want to sit in the sun of a window or go out onto a screened in back porch and catch flies but they never know the difference they live healthy and fullfilling lives indoors therefore it isn't cruel to expect them to live indoors all the time cats brought up outside or in an indoor outdoor environment tend to be harder to adjust to the indoor only scene but at the rescue we do it every day and most converted cats end up living happy lives indoors after the brief awkward stage where they try for the door whenever you open it so most of my cats and most of the cats i know are in before dusk and let out after dawn for safety reasons a lot of people have differing ideas but what it boils down to is that you are the animal's owner and protector you are the one responsible for the animal's safety it's better to be safe than sorry for their sake more than your emotional attachment indoor at night  Dog Guinea pig Domestication Domestic rabbit Avenue Q Gray Wolf Feral cat Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Hunting Hamster Pet skunk Fancy rat Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Puma Fox hunting Livestock Volleyball Poker jargon Shaggy dog story Garfield Kevin and Kell Trapping RuneScape quests EastEnders Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Amber Spyglass Horse Archery Leopard Kakapo God Emperor of Dune Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Lion Tlingit Spider Theory of conduct Taboo food and drink Sleep Passenger car Tag The Shining (film) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Honeybee Comanche House Animal rights The Invisibles Daylight saving time Feral Jam (TV series) The Death Gate Cycle Oh My Goddess!

bach rescue remedy new kitten how do i give it to her i will be picking up my new kitten today and i'm sure she will be very nervous with all of the new changes in her life so i was trying to think of a way to calm her down i also happen to already have some bach flower essences and i've been told that it is a great way to calm cats down but what i don't know is how to give it to her do i put it in her water apply it to some part of her body the bach rescue remedy is a good choice for her and will help with any emotional issues she has in her new home fears anxiety trauma from loss of mother siblings etc you just shake the bottle well and put three or four drops on the fur between her ears and you do it four or five times a day for a week or so it is normal for a kitten or cat to hide under a bed for quite a while when they first arrive in a new home she should be place in a small room for a period of adjustment anyway so she doesn't get lost and be hard for you to find you can simply put the drops on a small cloth and put it with her wherever she has found to be you would refresh the drops four or five times a day until she is ready to venture out flower essences are energetic in nature and do not have to be ingested to be effective it is important to use them intensely for effective treatment and putting drops in a water bowl just doesn't work with a cat because they don't drink enough water frequently enough to have any significant effect  Bach flower remedies Cat RuneScape quests The Catcher in the Rye Traumatic brain injury Social rule Stuttering Insomnia Anxiety Customs and etiquette of Japan Alcoholics Anonymous Urinary incontinence Vulcan (Star Trek) The Ashlee Simpson Show Fecal incontinence Autism Shaggy dog story EastEnders Domestic rabbit Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an God Emperor of Dune Pitaten The Death Gate Cycle The Amber Spyglass Diazepam Traditional Chinese medicine Baldness Badly Drawn Kitties Socialization Fancy rat Cannabis (drug) Sin City Post-traumatic stress disorder Ron Weasley Children of Dune Johann Sebastian Bach Professional wrestling match types Kitten Chlorpromazine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hypnosis Multiple sclerosis Homer Simpson Psoriasis The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Sant Thakar Singh Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.

i found a kitten that looks like its about a month but i am not sure i am trying to find out how old she is can anyone tell me why this kitten thats so small she fits into your hands has sharp lil teeth and is bitting she eats and fills up but she still wants to chew and knaw on my fingers toes leather ect could she be teething still i am worried that if she is older she is really malnurished i have been feeding her but i am afraid that she is eating to much her lil tummy is getting so big and she is more energetic yet i am still confused on about how old she is her teeth are still real small so i know she has to be at least a month anyone have any info on maybe an approx age or what i can do with her bitting it will be much appreciated if you would like to know how old she is put her on a scale to do this step on a weighing scale and look at your weight then pick up your kitten and step on the scale with the kitten in your arms every quarter of a pound means how many week old they are example you weigh pounds you pick up your kitten and hold her on the scale and now you weigh so that means she is only one week she probably is still teething i'd say she's about weeks if you are worried about her eating take a little food out everyday and see how your kitten reacts a lot of kittens have sharp little teeth when they are born and if she is small enough to fit in your hand it just means shes like weeks i would say for biting i would advise that you let her bite because she is just being playful because she doesn't understand scolding yet wait until she is a little bit older i'd say months to start scolding her for biting hope i helped  Dog training Breastfeeding Cat Piccolo Junior Saga Garfield Kitten Tooth Atomic Kitten Drill bit Ferret Computer numbering formats Hamster Knife Cheese Boxing Bat Shark Guinea pig Humphrey Bogart The Contender (television series) Elephant Super Size Me Hansel und Gretel Pet skunk Tyrannosaurus rex Adjustable gastric band Squirrel Ostrich Weighing scale Tooth enamel Electroconvulsive therapy Dog Pound Social rule Equine conformation Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Textile manufacturing Trapping Tuatara Salad Fingers Figure skating Ron and Fez Skateboarding trick Fancy rat Puma Kodocha Horse tack Dynamic random access memory Diving 2000 Australian Grand Prix Treecat Analog-to-digital converter RuneScape quests Internal ballistics Harp Spider Akatsuki (Naruto) Domestic rabbit Babe Ruth Rabbit Wire wrap Ben Johnson (athlete) Paper size Singlish Professional wrestling holds Dental caries Antarctic krill Extreme Programming Softball Mass Red Squirrel FoxTrot Money RISC Musical mode Poker jargon P-47 Thunderbolt Equal temperament Reiki EastEnders Sperm Whale Mountain Gorilla Swingout Fast bowling Haven (TNG episode) Coeliac disease Aerial (dance move) Dieting Weight Monster Rancher monsters Care Bears Counter Socialization Hand grenade Deflation (economics) Milton H.

should i put my cat down for many reasons my cat is now years old she was my second pet since i have been married she gets a long really well with my black lab we've had the lab longer but she absolutely hates my pomeranian years old and my other cat one year old see i also have children and they are all really good with the animals but my adult cat hides all the time and only wants attention from me here's the problem my older cat who's started to pee throughout the house she is fixed and has never done this before but i can't get her too stop now she is scared of my husband who yells at her a lot when she has peed on his hockey gear she is always hiding in the bathroom behind our toilet seat i have heard that no ones going to want a cat that pees in the house and once they start they don't stop i have been told to put her down by a family member can someone help i have had her advertised for a while and no luck have you thought of having her checked over by a vet very commonly what owners think is a behavior problem is actually a physical problem the cat may have a urinary infection and any amount of punishing her is not going to cure that the fact that this behavior has started recently suggests something has changed and it might be that she has gotten an infection cats do not urinate in inappropriate places to be bad or to make their owners angry or to express some emotion that is a case of human beings projecting their ow n feelings and how they act onto animals who don't think the same way and why would a cat want to do something that gets her punished and terrorized if she doesn't have a urinary infection and since it sounds like her relationship with your family has soured i suggest you take her to an animal shelter she may do fine in a home without other cats or dogs or children or some combination i adopted a cat who was brought to the animal hospital where i work by her owner who wanted her put to sleep because she urinated on the floor it turned out that the woman had recently remarried and there were now three lively boys and two dogs in the family and the cat was terrified i took her home and she has been immaculate about her litter box use from the first day in my house an ethical vet will not euthanize a healthy cat or one whose problem can be treated  Urinary incontinence Cat Dog Guinea pig Hamster Rabies Domestic rabbit Infantilism Pet skunk Prostate cancer Garfield Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Animal euthanasia Domestic violence Ferret Tobacco smoking Shaggy dog story Ranma __ characters Theory of conduct Friends Toilet humour Toilet The Fairly OddParents Urination Sin City Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Socialization Divorce Urine Avenue Q Animal shelter YuYu Hakusho Herpes simplex virus The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Characters of Lost EastEnders Oh My Goddess!

can a female cat not go into heat i have a two year old female that that was the runt of her litter we have not got her fixed yet since she has been an indoor cat and she has never done the dread yowl i remember well from my cat growing up well now we live in a townhouse and she has been pushing her way outside it is time to get her fixed but what i would like to know she has never shown any signs of being in heat she is also very anti social and doesn't like people could she just not be going through heat or just shy away for us not to notice because of her social anxiety also can a cat spontaneously go into heat when outside or is it in a cycle cats are pretty sneaky about a heat cycle especially if they are also shy cats anyway dogs have a much more obvious discharge it's easy to miss a cat's cycle that's how so many people end up with oops litters a friend of mine never noticed her cat in heat but wondered why every so often the cat peed in her laundry and hung out at the windows and doors i told her she was probably in heat and her vet confirmed it they can come in as often as once a month depending on the cat and they can become pregnant again while still nursing a litter cats are really prolific i would get her spayed asap so you don't have the responsibility of placing kittens most shelters are absolutely overrun with cats and many now refuse to take them i rescue street cats and after i've placed cats with everyone i know and many live with me i've run out of places too and it kills me to see them sick and on the streets unwanted kittens are so easy to prevent and your kitty will be much happier and calmer did you know that queens female cats that keep cycling and don't get bred can even get sick  Cat Domestic rabbit Socialization Dog Pet skunk Kitten Feral cat Manx (cat) Guinea pig Garfield RuneScape quests Estrus cycle Hamster Gray Wolf Fancy rat Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Jam (TV series) Lion Tobacco smoking Feral Housebreaking Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart Nuclear power Code: Lyoko Paranoia Agent God Emperor of Dune Tick Ren and Stimpy Chinese astrology Badly Drawn Kitties Dean Koontz Theory of conduct Characters of Lost Shaggy dog story Joke Tigon Prisoner (TV series) One Piece minor characters Chinese calendar Traumatic incident reduction Azumanga Daioh House Mouse European Rabbit Menstrual cycle Sheryl Crow Social rule Inception of Darwin's theory First aid EastEnders Okashina Okashi The Marshall Mathers LP Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Golden Retriever Cat litter Pet store Glossary of climbing terms Entropy Fire fighting The Death Gate Cycle Oh My Goddess!

i think my husband gave our cat away our friends came over monday to go swimming at our apartment and brought over a couple of their neighbors their one neighbor works for the same company as my husband but in a different building they all went swimming and when they came back our friends' neighbors were talking about wanting another cat and since we had several cats they asked for one of ours my husband was a little tipsy and was supposedly joking around with them and was telling them they could have one of our cats the girl said something like are you sure you aren't particular about which one we take and that's when i said we were not giving any of our pets away our cat was there that night and all of tuesday and also on wednesday morning arthur is a weird cat that comes out for attention in the morning before i leave for work and at night before we go to bed it dawned on me wednesday night that i hadn't seen arthur since that morning so i searched the entire apartment with no luck arthur is a very skittish cat who has never been outside in his life and won't even go into our apartment hallway when i told my husband about searching the place for the cat and that he wasn't in the apartment my husband got very defensive and asked me if i was trying to say that he did something with him i told him that i didn't even say that only that arthur was not in our apartment we have cats so i'm thinking my husband was hoping i wouldn't notice because my husband is stupid i'm not really sure what i'm asking i guess i'm trying to vent and see what i can do about this i don't really know these people because they are our friend's neighbors if my husband did give him away i guess i can just start giving away things that belong to my husband and not tell him see how he likes that i have a very strange update my husband just called and said he went home and looked for the cat and couldn't find him my husband never goes home during the day when he's supposed to be at work maybe once in a blue moon he will go home for lunch but it's too early for lunch right now and he didn't tell me the reason for going home i'm wondering if it was because he went and got the cat from these people and took him home or something like that seems very strange for him to even go home during the day in the first place and not only that but on the same day i was complaining about the cat being gone sounds like your man is up to something if he's gonna get defensive you might as well accuse him and ask if he did it i understand just wanting to vent you go girl i would be so pissed if someone took one of my pets and i would totally notice too i have cats and a dog but foster kittens and always catching and releasing strays and i would notice that's just effin' rude and disrespectful if he has a problem with there being too many cats he should have talked to you about it not just gotten rid of it and then lied ugh men  Shaggy dog story Garfield Paul Is Dead Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Inside Avenue Q Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) EastEnders Knots Landing Blood on the Tracks Phoebe Buffay's songs Ocean's Twelve One Piece minor characters AFI 100 Years series Russian joke The Star Wars Holiday Special Kodocha Social rule Good Morning, Vietnam The Catcher in the Rye Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Tree Hill (TV series) Piccolo Junior Saga 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Fiddler on the Roof Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Oasis (band) Dead Like Me Badly Drawn Kitties Little Britain Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans The Shining (film) Jon Secada Abigail Folger Sin City Doug Girly Good Times Operation Market Garden Pok__mon Live!

are there treatments for cats being depressed i am moving next monday to school and can't take my cats with me i have two but i am more worried about the younger one aspen both are rescues and my older one is more tough and she's a diva so she won't miss me but aspen follows me everywhere loves being petted played with sleeps all over me all the time and runs between my legs trying to trip me because it's a game for her lol they are staying here with my dad so no change in environment except that i won't be there they love my dad but aspen doesn't have the same bond with him that she does with me with her nature and people personality i really think she's going to get depressed i'll come back to visit often but it's the not same what can my dad to help her that's not even remotely close to what i asked jr i really love when people are arrogant enough to think that cats don't think or feel emotions beyond their immediate needs it is impossible to say exactly what emotions cats feel but when a close companion goes missing they are certainly aware of the absence and may search for that person or cat it is unlikely that they mourn in the human sense of the word but there will be some behavioural changes as they adjust to the gap in their lives as the cats will be staying on familiar territory with your dad whom they already know and love this will help them feel reassured any items of yours that are still in the home will have your scent which they may also find comforting cats are creatures of habit so ask your dad if he can try not to change the daily household routine too much as this will cause them additional stress in your absence your dad will become the primary caregiver and this will strengthen the existing bond between him and your cats hopefully both cats will be fine especially as you plan to visit often the web article when cats grieve contains information that you may find helpful http www messybeast com cat grief htm  Cat Grief Dog Transsexuality One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders Miss Saigon Friends The Amber Spyglass Ranma __ characters W.I.T.C.H.

what is it about baths that cats find so fascinating my cats will go and just sit in the bath no water obviously for hours on end i just don't understand why your cat may be sitting in the bathtub because they like to catch the water that drips from the faucet and drink it or they like the feeling of the cool surface on a hot day or it's a quiet place where no other family members go and it can just relax if your cat starts using the tub as a litter box or if you don't want your cats in the tub try putting water in it this should keep them out after a few days with water in it they won't venture back in again  Sento Sauna Bathing Customs and etiquette of Japan Tap (valve) Hydrotherapy Hot tub Urban beach Coriolis effect Shaggy dog story The Inside Onsen Swimming pool Plumbing fixture Japanese tea ceremony Social rule Jackass: The Movie Dundas Square Abstraction Hyperthermia Nudism Punt (boat) Dishwasher Coffee Cat on a Hot Tin Roof Dymaxion house Water Fountain Hamster Hot air balloon Blink-182 The Cat in the Hat Siphon Chinchilla Textile manufacturing Bidet Bird bath Mid-levels Hard water Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Ren and Stimpy Bathroom Water (molecule) Drowning Gay bathhouse Ankara Tooth enamel Swimming Fujian tea ceremony United Airlines Flight 93 Ben Johnson (athlete) Genericized trademark Casting Fancy rat Jazz Richard Chase Kodocha Carlsbad Caverns National Park Bocas del Toro Province USS Taylor (DD-468) Big Brother (USA TV series) Felis sapiens Japanese toilet Hot spring Saga (band) Hersheypark Solar power Turbulence Diving Drink Baptism Dairy Menstrual cup Paul Newman Caffeine Socrate Finnish sauna Kyle Broflovski Cat litter Chinese tea culture Temperature Chronic fatigue syndrome Toxoplasmosis Cruising (maritime) Ice Ocean's Twelve The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Friends Saw II Sleep Geyser Turkish Van Saw (film) Ganesha Hammam The Shining (film) Indianapolis 500 USS Sea Cat (SS-399) Cannabis cultivation

whats wrong with my kitten theres something wrong with jake my week old kitten his brothers and sisters are fine yesterday he wasnt playing like normal and he's gone limp and cold i took him to the vets and they injected water in him but its not done anything i'm feeding him kitten milk every hours by syringe he cant walk and isnt meowing anyone got any ideas the vet said he will probably die keep him warm firstly get a hot water bottle but make sure you cover it well with thick blanket then place him on there you're doing good by keep feeding him and the fact he wants to take milk still is good does that mean he isn't feeding from his own mother because there's no replacement for their own milk and being with his mother and the others might give him the will to live he must not give up if the vet injected water in him then he sounds like he's really dehydrated maybe he needs to go back to the vets or a different vet he might need a shot of vitamins too or something or glucose to stimulate him my mum used to breed pedigree kittens and a couple of them did seem at deaths door but my mum never gave up hope and tried everything she could it's tiring and upsetting she even had one that had brain damage and couldn't walk but she kept with it even though the vet said it would die and it made a massive turn around and ended up fine it's now got a loving home to sum up keep feeding yourself if it's not feeding off mother if mother is there keep kitten with her all the time keep kitten warm take back vets there's always something else they can do believe in yourself ps if the kitten does die then obviously you will feel sad but at least you will have done all you could the absolute best of luck to you o  Guinea pig Atomic Kitten Kitten Cat Ferret StarCraft: Hybrid Chocolate Breastfeeding About a Boy Garfield Insulin EastEnders Protein-energy malnutrition Social rule Yoko Ono Dairy Domestic rabbit Little Britain Hypoglycemia Hey Jude Milk Bat Boy Knots Landing Pet skunk Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Shaggy dog story Singlish Red Hot Chili Peppers Sin City Dehydration Hamster Alanis Morissette Nutrition Badly Drawn Kitties One Tree Hill (TV series) Hip hop rivalries Poker jargon Charmed Bong Joy Division (band) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pitaten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory RuneScape quests Coffee Manx (cat) YuYu Hakusho Carburetor Limp Bizkit Teen Girl Squad The Marshall Mathers LP Tea Kodocha K' Fancy rat Diabetes mellitus Spice Girls Marilyn Monroe Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Doors Items in the Metroid series Tofu Hypothermia Paul Is Dead Chicken Sarah Kerrigan Vitamin C Father Ted Arthur Laffer Premature birth Big Brother UK series 6 Fancy Crane Customs and etiquette of Japan Characters in the Smurfs Comanche About Schmidt Salad Fingers Saturday Night Live 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Days of our Lives Humphrey Bogart Drowning Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Silent Night, Deadly Night Stroke The Shining (film) Dieting 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Rabbit Another World (TV series) Pulp Fiction Phoebe Buffay's songs The Smoking Room True Crime: Streets of LA Phoebe Halliwell Tire

how do i remove the glue off a glue trap from my cats hair the glue traps for mice are really sticky my cat layed on one of them and he has that all over his belly my cat is a persian cat with a lot of hair and i cant get that glue off i need help ok this could be tough as glue is designed to stay put the first thing you could do is to rub some mineral oil like caster oil or vasaline into the area and then with a mild detergent like washing up liquid wash the affected area remeber not to get any into the eyes if the glue comes out t might be agood idea to wash the cat a full bath using a special cat shampoo if the glue stays put then i'm afraid the only answer is to cust the fur to be honest it would be best if you could take them to a professional animal groomer who will have the special shavers to safely remove all the fur down to the skin as the glue might cause a reaction and is a much safer option than trying to cut the fur yourself good luck  Shampoo Leather Fur Hamster Garfield Tanning Upholstery Trapping Solvent Tattoo Soap Acne Cheetah Fancy rat Ranma __ characters Dandruff Smoke-screen Sulfuric acid Multiple chemical sensitivity Psoriasis Spider Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Laundry detergent Tarantula Comanche Dragon Booster Sento Washing machine Hydrogen peroxide Pet skunk Sewage treatment House Mouse Road Rovers Depilation Clinker (boat building) Professional wrestling match types Shaving Cat coat genetics Pepper spray Textile manufacturing Felis sapiens Printed circuit board Carnivorous plant Social rule Peanut Stomach cancer Clothing Piccolo Junior Saga Casting Domestic rabbit Motor oil Fecal incontinence Pitaten Salad Fingers Guinea pig Care Bears Baldness treatments The Star Wars Holiday Special Fishing Pok__mon Abilities Diving suit Manicure Hard water Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma RuneScape quests Dry cleaning Fur trade Dean Koontz Chinchilla Genericized trademark Fur farming Animal communication Hyperthermia American Bison The Secret of NIMH Hand washing Hair conditioner Violin Nuclear power 2003 North America blackout Knife The Amber Spyglass Tenchi Muyo!

cat walks funny ever since my cat was spayed over a year ago she walks funny its kind of hard to explain how she walks but her legs kinda go outward first kinda like shes waddling like a duck she also started getting fat around the same time she has one of those cow bellies going probably the worst thing of all tho is she sheds more then any cat i have ever encountered i have never had less then cats my entire life i consider that alot of experience with cats by sheds alot i mean she will shed handfulls of hair with every stroke i can comb her outside on the deck for hours straight and she will still be shedding as much as when i started when you look at her you can see the hair just barely hanging on ready to fall off if i pick her up my shirt is instantly covered would take an hour to pick each hair off she never has any bald spots tho i feel bad for her cause people want to play with her less due to the shedding i would never trade her for anything but i want her to be well first off the spay was free as it comes as part of price you pay from spca so i certainlly didn't choose the cheapest vet i could find i just went to the local vet i sure hope the vet didn't just do a poor job i have taken her to the vet since the spay and the vet didn't seem to think there was any problem i can't help but feel there is tho also for the shedding i have tried buying some of the more expensive brands of catfood i had recommended to me to help with the shedding that didn't seem to help severe shedding can be a real nuisance to groom your cat a steel toothed dog comb will get down to the skin and remove more of the loose hair when you're done combing wet your hands and pet her that will also pull off loose fur but not all of it as a last resort you can get a furminator which is a special de shedding tool that gets off more cat hair than i've ever seen you need to use this in an easy to clean place like the bathroom because every time you pass the tool over the cat you will get more and more off it took me different sessions my hand got tired before any significant reduction in the amount of hair coming off the plus side of this is that the cat loved it apparently it's something like humans having their backs scratched his coat felt much better after a couple of sessions with this tool you can get it in most pet stores and on line through pet supply places or amazon it was definitely worth the price  Domestic rabbit Cat Guinea pig Dairy Dog Fancy rat Shaggy dog story Poker jargon Hair Garfield Pet skunk Ferret Knife Textile manufacturing Conker's Bad Fur Day Aerial (dance move) Trailer Park Boys Drill bit Hamster Microeconomics Manx (cat) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Breastfeeding Keeshond Baldness Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mattress 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Death Gate Cycle Siberian Husky Clothing Plastic Laserdisc The Amber Spyglass Horse 1957 World Series Sin City Dog training Time Out of Mind Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Socialization Red Dwarf characters Hypoglycemia Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Friends Jackass: The Movie Escape from New York The Price Is Right Glossary of climbing terms Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Baldness treatments Dilbert Housebreaking Jennifer Lopez Social rule Feral cat Equine conformation Sears Holdings Corporation Randomness Textile manufacturing terminology Weaving The Inside Kodocha Androgen insensitivity syndrome The Apprentice 2 Menstrual cup Rent (musical) W.I.T.C.H.

what would you do i am a registered cat breeder i do not get along with my mother have basically cut her out of my life when i became a breeder she made it very clear she thought this was a bad idea recently when i was ill she came around it seems she has fallen in love with an older kitten i have that i just cannot find a home for in may i had asked my mother a few key questions about getting a second cat as i knew she wanted a friend for her current cat i was going to offer her this kitten i have as i know he is exactly what she would want she made it clear that she did not want another cat at the time now she has met the kitten she is constantly dropping hints that she loves him thinks he's gorgeous etc etc i am still tempted to offer him to her again but since she basically flung my offer back in my face when i last made the suggestion i am reluctant to do so also i think my husband has fallen in love with the kitten what should i do to linda c thank you for your honest answer i'm well aware of all the costs involved as i have been a registered breeder now for quiet some time i think overall i am still about au of even coming close to breaking even not that it bothers me or my husband i want to do the right thing for this kitten as he is a real little sweetheart at this point i am figuring he will remain with us as he is a very timid but trusts us plus who wouldn't want to keep a kitten that smooches up to you under the doona everynight although having said that i might never sell a single kitten if i keep every kitten that does that cat breeding is not all kittens and cuteness it can be an expensive hobby with a lot of responsibility as a cat breeder we want to get the best possible homes for our cats irregardless of the money involved if you do it right you can't make money breeding cats anyway then there's the kitten that just doesn't find a home right away he still deserves a good home so the question is would your mother make a good home for the cat since she already has one cat and has told you that she was clear she did not want another cat i think that 's the end of the story i'd plan on talking to my husband about it and plan on keeping the kitten for now if your mother truly wants the kitten all she has to do is ask rather than hinting around because hints have a way of being misinterpreted if she loves him and says he's so gorgeous she might not necessarily want him she might just want to visit him because you and your mother don't get along you could be reading this wrong and she could be giving you mixed signals you offered the kitten once she said no she could always change her mind but then that would mean she'd need to talk to you about it i can also see that you're reluctant to offer the kitten because it's hard to accept being shot down so i'd say give it time and the answer will reveal itself as far as i'm concerned there is always room for one more cat or two  Pitaten Friends Social rule EastEnders Badly Drawn Kitties Avenue Q The Amber Spyglass Kodocha Miss Saigon Theory of conduct God Emperor of Dune Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Little Britain Knots Landing About a Boy One Tree Hill (TV series) Ferret The Ashlee Simpson Show Extreme Programming Inception of Darwin's theory Jam (TV series) RuneScape quests Microeconomics The Lovely Bones Bad Wolf Current teachings of Prem Rawat The Emancipation of Mimi Kasparov versus The World Lie Characters in the Smurfs The nature of God in Western theology Neighbours Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Girly Transactional analysis Great Teacher Onizuka Time Out of Mind Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Apprentice 2 Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Good Times Manx (cat) Ocean's Twelve Atomic Kitten Days of our Lives Doug Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Cat The Invisibles Mojave people Children of Dune Philosophy of mathematics Trailer Park Boys Rocko's Modern Life Monster Rancher monsters Gross domestic product Charmed Philosophy of language Incarnations of Immortality Piccolo Junior Saga Ranma __ characters Socrates Milton H.

tips on introducing a new kitten to our cat hello all we already have a female cat who is year her name is lala we also just recently got a new kitten who is a boy and his name is meatball we figured she might like having a new companion yet it seems like shes not having it at all i was wondering if anyone had any tips on introducing them to one another and creating a kitty harmony right now we keep meatball in a seperate room and we havent really let them see eachother we also have been switching them in and out of eachothers rooms so they can sniff eachother lala seems kind of aggresive towards him shes always hissing at the door he is behind and she hisses at us if we smell like him it just seems like she hates him i would hate for them to never get along i would really love for them to get along and any help is very much appreciated thanks lala has been our only baby for awhile so i can understand her jealousy thanks for all your answers yes miss lala is the alpha diva and yes she is spayed there hasn't really been much going on except for her hissing at us and meatball we have also been sticking a sock on our hand when we pet meatball and pet lala with it too to swap smells that doesn't bother her really also has anyone heard of or used feliway spray i heard that that can also help in introducing cats thanks again hissing and growling is usual cats hate change and lala considers herself alpha and now there is competition if there is only hissing and no blood drawn then there is no need to keep them separate any longer time is the best healer of disputes witchie gave you good advice you can also take a towel and rub each of them in turn transferring the scents to each other that works best when they simply don't recognize each other however like on a return from a vet visit when they come back with the dreaded 'vet scent' let them see each other and simply watch unless it gets real serious let them do what they want and by serious i mean fur really flying and serious biting or clawing growling and hissing is to be expected perhaps this might go on for several weeks and then lessen and perhaps they become even bosom buddies just be sure to have meatball neutered at the appropriate age i hope lala is spayed  Cat Pet skunk Garfield Ferret Dog Domestic rabbit Shaggy dog story Kitten Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Guinea pig Feral cat Phoebe Buffay's songs Skunk Housebreaking Badly Drawn Kitties W.I.T.C.H.

do cats and dogs know each other's language your cat can propably better detect what you dog is saying better than you can and vice versa cats and dogs are closely related in the animal kingdom their strongest source of communication is through scent your dog can detect if your cat marked that spot and vice versa your dog will spend more time sniffing a used scratching post than he will a new shirt cats and dogs can also better detect warning and welcome signals humans may over look a cats ears setting back on it's head but a dog knows that means leave me alone of course the dog may still want his way and try to mess with the cat anyway although dogs have been domesticated longer than cats for nearly the past hundreds of years cats have been domesticated right alongside dogs most important though is that dogs and cats are very similar even long before they were domesticated although cats are primarily lone hunters and dogs pack hunters they still communicate primarily with scent  Cat Dog Housebreaking Hunting Leopard Beagle Gray Wolf Ferret Cheetah Olfaction Obedience training Rabies Working dog Skunk Domestication German Shepherd Dog Manx (cat) Catgirl Feral Dog training Road Rovers Morphology (linguistics) Hybrid Scent hound Lion Hedgehog Tasmanian Devil Sabretooth (comics) Puma Microphone Teacher's Pet (Disney) Fancy rat Guinea pig Sight hound Lycanthropy Basset Hound Horse Kakapo Boar Carnivore Mickey Mouse Pitaten Pig Azumanga Daioh Taboo food and drink Vampire Philosophy of language Livestock Rose Pet skunk Asteroid Socialization RuneScape gods Selective breeding Tai shogi Spotted Skunk Fox hunting Scooby-Doo Police dog Coat (dog) Elephant Kevin and Kell Fox Fur Slovak language Treecat Animal Liberation Front Felis sapiens Tooth enamel Polish language Democratic Party (United States) USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Wallace and Gromit Spot the Dog Dalmatian Feral cat Objective-C Invader Zim Chimera (genetics) Stone Age Phantom cat Medieval hunting Wild Cat Coyote H5N1 House Mouse Paranoia Agent Melanin Characters in the Smurfs Black panther Radar American football Shaggy dog story Lady and the Tramp Alaskan Malamute Computed tomography Animated television series

wild cats with a wolf worm question i have a small wild cat that i feed and she has got a large worm wolf inbeded in her chest it is all pusy and big how can i help this poor cat with out having to shoot it by the way the cat is too wild to catch just wandering if their was something i could put out in a pan or some thing to help it aslo how did a worm get in its chest what are symptoms of wolf worm in cat wolf worm is a nick name for the larvae of a cuterebra fly also known as bot fly it is most commonly seen as warbles in wild rabbits and squirrels but has also been found on the domestic cat bot fly larvae appear as a hole in the skin that moves and or tumor like lumps under the skin that can be seen to move or wiggle with a hole dead center this is the worm under the skin the hole is there so they can breathe contrary to the old wives tale that bot fly eggs are ingested and kill the animal from eating from the inside out the larvae is from an egg that the bot fly lays on the animal it hatches and burrows into the skin they are most commonly found around the head or neck bot fly larvae in the skin are serious due to the secondary infection that they can cause but the living larvae themselves do not contribute to the problem where they become deadly serious is when the animal scratches and kills the larvae causing a secondary infection that can be extremely serious if it goes unnoticed also they may affect the trachea or brain as can be common in cats the symptoms of a trachea infection are coughing chocking gagging and respiratory brain infestations manifest with various neurological symptoms if you suspect bot fly larvae please take the cat to the vet while you may believe you can safely remove the larvae the risk is too great that there are other larvae and or that some of the larvae remain in the wound causing a possible fatal infection trap it and take to a vet if not it is going to die  Fancy rat Rabies Trichinosis Baylisascaris Gypsy moth Ascariasis Cat Pneumonia Tuberculosis Guinea pig Ferret Cancer Schistosomiasis Lung cancer Domestic rabbit Diseases of the honeybee Tsetse fly Tick Mosquito Chicken Spider Hookworm Botfly Traumatic brain injury Cephalic disorder Beetle Aspartame Group A streptococcal infection Scabies AIDS Tarantula Chagas disease Anthrax Snake Urinary incontinence First aid Werewolf Dracunculiasis Rocky Mountain spotted fever Cysticercosis Vampire The Legend of Zelda series enemies Dog H5N1 Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Decompression sickness Toxoplasmosis Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Anopheles GunBound Bat Biological pest control Echinococcosis Myxobolus cerebralis Hamster Kakapo Common cold Diarrhea Allergy Radiation therapy Pet skunk Crohn's disease Toxocariasis Diabetes mellitus Chronic fatigue syndrome Hypoglycemia Onchocerciasis Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Turner syndrome Taboo food and drink Asthma Paracetamol Bubonic plague Syphilis Multiple sclerosis Animal Myiasis Reptile Strongyloidiasis Brain Whipworm Stroke Diphyllobothriasis Myasthenia gravis Creatures in Bionicle Piccolo Junior Saga Dinosaur Poliomyelitis Gray Wolf

my cat was kidnapped and dropped off in another town by my neighbor i recently went to the beach for the week and left my cat at home he is an in outdoor cat so i knew he would be fine i left him plenty of food and water as well as access to his usual shelter when i got back my neighbor announced to me that he took my cat to the vet to have him euthanized but then he decided to give the cat a second chance so he dropped him off in a nearby town i was furious so i asked him why in the world he would do that he said that he thought that the cat had heartworms so he didn't want his dog getting them too i told him to put his dog on heartguard and he wouldn't have to worry about it anyway what should i do is there anything that the spca humane society etc could do about it who do i report it to i want my cat back and i don't want my neighbor from hell to get away with this help i'd actually call your local police dept and try to report him through there and if they don't handle these kinds of issues than ask them who you should report him to if your cat went in his yard than i'm not sure how much you can do but hopefully he'll get in trouble enough to get him to not be such an ass besides the fact that he's a moron and heartworms aren't contracted by other animals they are contracted from mosquito bites if his animal is outdoors and isn't on heartworm preventative than his animal is totally wide open to the potential of getting heartworms even if no other animals are present if you find your cat and hopefully you will i'd just make your cat an indoor cat to keep your jerky neighbor from getting his hands on him if he wants his dog to stay healthy than he needs to do what's right for his dog ie heartworms tests yearly heartworm pills monthly and vaccinations not take out your pets  Heartworm Rabies Pet skunk Socialization Shaggy dog story Dog training Ferret Animal shelter Knots Landing Garfield Domestic rabbit EastEnders Theory of conduct Hamster Humphrey Bogart Gray Wolf Social rule Animal euthanasia People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Animal rights RuneScape quests Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Anopheles Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Taboo food and drink Richard Chase Organic farming Kodocha One Tree Hill (TV series) Microchip implant (animal) The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Trailer Park Boys Tooth enamel H5N1 The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe 2000 Australian Grand Prix Kitten Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Malaria Pitaten Feral Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Housebreaking Livestock Radio Yerevan The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Feral cat colony Sin City Zoophilia Fancy Crane Cancer Phoebe Buffay's songs Rent (musical) Marilyn Monroe Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Fancy rat 2001 UK foot and mouth crisis Tenshinhan Futurama (TV series - season 5) Dilbert The Inside Avenue Q Coprophagia Kakapo Abortion debate Tick Flea The Lovely Bones SMTV Live The Death Gate Cycle DDT The Critic West Nile virus The X-Files (season 1) The Amber Spyglass Goldfish Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Greyhound Ren and Stimpy Feral cat The Invisibles The Subtle Knife Rabbit Whaling Haven (TNG episode) Donald Rumsfeld Elvis Presley Doraemon Ranma __ characters 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Ron Weasley Ultimate (sport)

help from people who have cat rescues plz we had a cat that my son took to his house a years ago well he has to move an the cat had to come back here were it grew up we have adult cats when we brought the old new cat in an let it out of the cage it was a fight bad and the cats we already have dont really get along well with one but never any fights just hiss at him this time the got into the fight then they went after the the one they dont like how do you get them to get along we put the new cat in a bedroom alone can we ever get them to get along an if so how i do not want any more cat fights an one get hurt how do you people who take in adult cats make them get along always always put a new cat in a safe room when you're first bringing it into the house where there is already an adult cat it will help you avoid situations like this until they get accustomed to one another now to answer your question i would leave the cat in a safe room and not let the other cats in you can take a towel or similar object and rub it on the cat that the others dont like then put that towel in your lap when you leave the room and let the other cats come and lay on your lap and pet them just get them to associate the scent of the other cat with good things like being petted etc then always monitor meetings between the cats i would only introduce one cat at a time to each other that way they can't gang up something you can try if this doesn't help over time is a product that calms cats down some are pet ease spray and comfort zone spray of diffuser these release pheromones that calm cats down and may make meetings between the cats a lot more calm  Fire fighting Pet skunk Cat Hamster Ranma __ characters Pitaten Domestic rabbit Friends Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) God Emperor of Dune Dog Upholstery Socialization RuneScape quests Sauna Shaggy dog story 2000 Australian Grand Prix Spanking Mixed martial arts Menstrual cycle Dog training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Cube (film) Housebreaking Sin City Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fancy rat The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Towel The Amber Spyglass Ron Weasley Jam (TV series) Garfield Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy The Death Gate Cycle Theory of conduct Conker's Bad Fur Day Canary Guinea pig Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Kakapo One Piece minor characters Land use forecasting EastEnders Skunk Breastfeeding Professional wrestling match types Columbine High School massacre Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Chinchilla Atomic Kitten Lie Ferret Jumpstart 3rd Grade The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tenchi Muyo!

will two male cats get along i have a yr old male cat and my step sister needs to find a home for her yr old male my cat is very territorial and i am worried that they will never get along the other cat is very easy going and never gets upset it's important to have realistic expectations when introducing a new pet to a resident pet some cats are more social than other cats for example an eight year old cat that has never been around other animals may never learn to share her territory and her people with other pets in the household however an eight week old kitten separated from her mom and littermates for the first time might prefer to have a cat or dog companion cats are territorial and need to be introduced to other animals very slowly in order to give them time to get used to each other before there is a face to face confrontation slow introductions help prevent fearful and aggressive problems from developing please note when you introduce pets to each other one of them may send play signals which can be misinterpreted by the other pet if those signals are interpreted as aggression by one animal then you should handle the situation as aggressive confinement confine your new cat to one medium sized room with her litter box food water and a bed feed your resident pets and the newcomer on each side of the door to this room this will help all of them to associate something enjoyable eating with each other's smells don't put the food so close to the door that the animals are too upset by each other's presence to eat gradually move the dishes closer to the door until your pets can eat calmly directly on either side of the door next use two doorstops to prop open the door just enough to allow the animals to see each other and repeat the whole process swap scents switch sleeping blankets or beds between your new cat and your resident animals so they have a chance to become accustomed to each other's scent rub a towel on one animal and put it underneath the food dish of another animal you should do this with each animal in the house switch living areas once your new cat is using her litter box and eating regularly while confined let her have free time in the house while confining your other animals to the new cat's room this switch provides another way for the animals to experience each other's scents without a face to face meeting it also allows the newcomer to become familiar with her new surroundings without being frightened by the other animals avoid fearful and aggressive meetings avoid any interactions between your pets that result in either fearful or aggressive behavior if these responses are allowed to become a habit they can be difficult to change it's better to introduce your pets to each other so gradually that neither animal becomes afraid or aggressive you can expect mild forms of these behaviors but don't give them the opportunity to intensify if either animal becomes fearful or aggressive separate them and start over with the introduction process in a series of very small gradual steps as outlined above precautions if one of your pets has a medical problem or is injured this could stall the introduction process check with your veterinarian to be sure that all of your pets are healthy you'll also want to have at least one litter box per cat and you'll probably need to clean all of the litter boxes more frequently make sure that none of the cats are being ambushed by another while trying to use the litter box try to keep your resident pets' schedule as close as possible to what it was before the newcomer's appearance cats can make lots of noise pull each other's hair and roll around quite dramatically without either cat being injured if small spats do occur between your cats you shouldn't attempt to intervene directly to separate the cats instead make a loud noise throw a pillow or use a squirt bottle with water and vinegar to separate the cats give them a chance to calm down before re introducing them to each other be sure each cat has a safe hiding place  Animal communication Fancy rat Pet skunk Guinea pig Ferret Socialization Housebreaking Dog training Shaggy dog story Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Garfield Breastfeeding Social rule Milton H.

cats and dogs do you think that even though my cat and dog aren't particularly fond of each other they don't fight or anything they just don't cuddle or get excessively close that they prefer each others company as opposed to being alone like when we aren't home they probably are better being together and from my experience i would say that the dog probably likes that cat more than the cat likes the dog cats usually want you the owner all to themselves and get moody when the dog is sniffing their bottom haha hope i could help  Cat Housebreaking Characters in Bleach series Rottweiler The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Dog Domestic rabbit Trailer Park Boys The Jetsons American Pit Bull Terrier RuneScape quests Oliver and Company Morphology (linguistics) Azumanga Daioh Reservoir Dogs Ferret Obedience training Manx (cat) Pet skunk Steven Wright Minor Harry Potter Beasts Dog agility Scooby-Doo Felis sapiens The Strangerhood Carnivore Buttocks Dog training German Shepherd Dog Sphynx (cat) Leopard Teacher's Pet (Disney) Socialization Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Staffordshire Bull Terrier Fancy rat Puma Philosophy of language Diazepam Tom Waits People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Little Britain Happy Tree Friends 2 Stupid Dogs Okashina Okashi Inspector Gadget Pekingese Hachiko Princess Tutu Coprophagia Lion Alley Cat The Smoking Room Humphrey Bogart Kangaroo Saturday Night Live commercial AFI 100 Years series Phantom cat Selective breeding Squidward Tentacles Animal shelter Maison Ikkoku Newshounds Mickey Mouse Hot dog RuneScape gods Dog show Pet Wall Street Waylon Jennings Lindy Basic Russian joke Feral Andrew Lloyd Webber Data (Star Trek) Border Terrier Ranma __ characters Kakapo Paintball Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Snoopy Tiger George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron Muttley Police dog Felix the Cat Friends Microchip implant (animal) Estrus cycle Carnivora Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers Mutts Glendale, California Monster Rancher monsters Chuck Jones Ren and Stimpy Domestication Basset Hound Road Rovers

my cat was diagnosed with renal failure her vet wanted me to put her down but i didn't feel it was time yet her vet prescribed several meds to be taken x a day this was extremely stressful on my cat got to the point she'd vomit when she saw me getting them ready one month ago i quit all meds because i wanted her last days to be good not a constant battle the vet told me she'd die in days not so she is doing pretty well acting normal even playing she is however very thin but still eating my question is before i quit the meds her urine did not have any odor to it now it has a very strong amonia smell as it did when she was well does this mean her kidney or kidneys are functioning no it's just a stage of kidney failure kidney failure is very common in old cats and some younger ones if cats don't die of an accident or an acute illness or cancer the cause of their death is usually kidney failure cats didn't used to live long enough for kidney failure to develop but now that cats are commonly living into their late teens we see it more and more often your situation with your cat is not unusual the medicines and special diet can slow the progress of the disease but nothing can cure it or reverse the damage eventually the cat is so stressed by the medicines that it ruins the relationship between the cat and the owner at that point most owners stop trying to force the medicine on the cat and stop insisting on the kidney diet which most cats dislike and let the cat eat whatever it wants the vet i work for does not oppose the owners doing this the illness is terminal the cat might as well enjoy what time it has left usually there is a period of time like you describe when the cat is happier and seems better it may last for months usually there will be a sudden dramatic turn for the worse the cat stop eating entirely it drools from sores in its mouth and it may have seizures it's obvious that the time for euthanasia has come so what you're doing is common for owners of cats with terminal kidney disease and you're not harming your cat she might live longer if you were insistent about the medicines and the diet but that would not make her happier it's a question of quality of life i have a cat with early kidney failure and i expect i will do the same thing you are doing when the time comes  Diabetes mellitus Stomach cancer Medicine Prostate cancer Pneumonia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hypoglycemia IgA nephropathy Urinary incontinence Kidney Paracetamol Gout Tobacco smoking Acute renal failure Nephrology Vitamin C Cat Ferret Breastfeeding Traumatic brain injury Palliative care Hypertension Chronic fatigue syndrome Rabies Psoriasis Abortion debate Diabetic nephropathy Multiple sclerosis Weight training Coeliac disease Multiple myeloma Charles Darwin's illness Glycogen storage disease type I Acute respiratory distress syndrome Epilepsy 2000 Australian Grand Prix Alcoholism Tocopherol Guinea pig Anorexia nervosa Theory of conduct Paget's disease of bone Dialysis Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Fancy rat Euthanasia Group A streptococcal infection Myocardial infarction Autism Crohn's disease Cephalic disorder Lupus erythematosus Alternative medicine Coronary heart disease EastEnders Turner syndrome Growth hormone treatment Milton H.

will a kitten help my cat loose weight i have a year old mixed breed neutered male cat who has been diagnosed as obese he weighs lbs when he should weigh about or less i am trying to change his diet but i fear that exercise is what's really missing i am not home enough to exercise with him enouh to really get him to work out and when we do play he usually lays down after a few minutes i am wondering if getting a more insistent play mate wouldhelp him exercise do you think it would just stress him or otherwise piss him off he is indoor outdoor before you start getting preachy about how it isn't safe for him to go outdoors please note that i live in the country and he comes in for the evening every evening so save your words on that topic hi amy i just went through the same thing myself my year old cat was alone a lot during the day so he was starting to get a little overweight and would terrorize the house when i was away b c he was bored i adopted a kitten and while it wasn't easy at first he became much more active and has been on better behavior now that he has someone to play with the tough part of your situation is that you have a year old cat his activity level and diet are going to be tough to change right now but if you're interested in getting another cat anyway it sounds like you have the space so why not try it there are lots of stray kittens that need loving homes and even if it doesn't improve your cats physical health it will definitely be good for him to have someone around all the time to love good luck  Cat Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Anorexia nervosa Garfield Kitten Pet skunk Hamster Binge eating disorder Dog Manx (cat) Treecat Cats (musical) Hypertension Socialization Fancy rat Exercise Puma Pitaten Breastfeeding Richard Feynman Species Livestock Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Autism Coeliac disease Body mass index Elephant Kim Possible RuneScape quests Time Out of Mind Super Size Me Softball Diabetes mellitus Equine conformation Piccolo Junior Saga Gender Feral cat Chronic fatigue syndrome Bulgarian language USS Waters (DD-115) Weight training Maine Coon Theory of conduct Paragliding Pound Physical attractiveness Little Britain Giant Panda Stuttering Atomic Kitten Housebreaking Social rule Dieting Friends M16 (rifle) Human sexual behavior Cancer The Ashlee Simpson Show Clinical depression Land use forecasting Scientology beliefs and practices Raw food diet Shit Atkins Nutritional Approach Space Shuttle program Pump It Up Robert A.

my oldest cat has problems with my oldest cat is nine years old and well he has problems with keeping food down i have taken him to the vet to check for any underlaying problems and there are none i have switch brands of food and still he throws up food on a regular basis is there anything that might help the cat keep food down i also give him special food that is made for sensitive stomachs and it doesn't help i also don't buy the bargain brands of supermarket pet food what does anyone that gives their cat at this stage when nothing helps and the sensitive stomach foods cause more problems to him throwing up when i went to the vet he told me to try vaseline for the hairballs since both cats are long haired i used it on both and well i took him to three different vets who all said to change him over to a sensitive food diet did that the last vet gave him all sorts of tests and my cat came out clean for all of them including some stomach biposies so had him tested and all came back with a negative both cats get feed four times a day in small amounts but i've never heard of giving a cat pumpkin before i already get the sensitive stomach cat food it just seems to upset his tummy more have you tried feeding him small amounts more often he may be throwing up because he eats too fast an indication of this is if they throw up right after eating you can also try canned pumpkin unsweetened kind it will help settle his stomach if it is upset and put some nutrients in him but even with that give small amounts more often instead of a lot at once pumpkin is generally given to dogs but i also give it to my cats if they need it it helps with diarrhea constipation and upset stomach given it is just a condition stress food related got into the human food etc and not a symptom of an underlying problem pumpkin can als be used as a fill in for regular food for overweight animals so they have something in their stomach but are not getting the fat and calories from their regular food as far as i know they can eat as much as they want and it will not hurt them but it will make their poop orange the other posibility is he is allergic to something in the food if that has not already been tested for and yet a rd thing is he could just be a vomiter if he is keeping enough food down to maintain his health and otherwise acts perfectly normal he could just be a cat who throws up a lot my oldest cat did that off and on for a few years i changed foods but the vet said he was normal and healthy and seemed to be getting enough to eat and since he was not acting sick that he would be fine and he is he has stopped vomiting frequently it has been several years he is years old and long haired  Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Food Cat Breastfeeding Anorexia nervosa Nutrition Chocolate Fancy rat Hamster Gastroparesis Adjustable gastric band Vitamin C Prostate cancer Diarrhea Fecal incontinence Dieting Hypoglycemia Ferret Binge eating disorder Vomiting Dietary fiber Veganism Pneumonia Tocopherol Kashrut Urinary incontinence Healthy eating Diabetes mellitus Foodborne illness Insulin Chronic fatigue syndrome Chemotherapy Egg (food) Cancer Dog Vegetarianism Tooth Tooth enamel Aspartame Raw food diet Kodocha Milk Taboo food and drink Super Size Me Dairy Little Britain Atkins Nutritional Approach Lactose intolerance Multiple chemical sensitivity Animal testing Pitaten Cirrhosis Fugu Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Pet skunk Crohn's disease Charles Darwin's illness Livestock Paracetamol Homer Simpson Sauerkraut Pumpkin Theory of conduct Natural Hygiene Foie gras Cat food Weight loss Shark Food allergy Colorectal cancer Organic food Polycystic ovary syndrome Botulism Clinical depression Welding Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Menstrual cycle Gastroesophageal reflux disease Folic acid Kitten Characters of The Sandman Calorie restriction Carburetor The Ashlee Simpson Show Chicken Burdock Animal rights Obstetrics HIV test Fasting Genetically modified food

cat hissing please help very concerned i took my year old cat to the vets today to get his shots updated when we got home our other cat he is months old started hissing and growling at the cat who went to the vets and at myself this was about hours ago and it has not stopped at all any help regarding what i can do about this would be great thanks my guess is the cat that went to the vet and you smell funny to the other cat it would be just like introducing the all over again the younger cat can smell the vet on you and the older cat and it is strange and scarry the younger one may avoid the of you for a couple days you could try luring the younger one with canned food or a treat or something if the younger one is hissing when either one of you approach and generally avoiding you it is because he is scared sometimes they take a while to get over it watch the younger cat and see if he is sneaking up on the older one like he wants to see it but does not want to get too close if so that is a pretty good indication that given time things should get back to normal of my cats one hissed at our new dog for a month now he hugs and plays with him i usually have a cat fight if i take one cat to the vet and not the other as long as there is just hissing and growling and no inguries i usually do not worry about it too much it usually resolves it's self with mine the best way to get them over the thinking the other cat is strange is by giving them all wet food it changes their mind set and by the time they are done eating they realize it is still the same cat  Cat Garfield Dog training Sin City Shaggy dog story Phoebe Buffay's songs Kakapo Social rule Fancy rat Cockroach Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Milton H.

how do i train my yr cat to stop pulling up my carpet i have a new burberry carpet and she is addicted to pulling up the loops in the carpet she loves string i have given her sistic posts as well several toys to play with to deter her i have used a spray bottle when she is in the act but she's has already done the damage usually done when i'm sleeping near sunrise i've sprayed the carpet with pet organics no scratch from petco but the cat still insists on the pulling up the carpet i've also yelled no when she is lowering her head to start the act of pulling up the carpet but doesn't work either does anyone have any suggestions to help me out yes i had the same problem so i can certainly relate to your dilemma here are a few possible solutions to your problem i read about them and they worked for me first i would like to just ask if nothing works please please do not declaw her it is the equivalent to us having the tips of our fingers cut off down to the first joint many many cats suffer permanent pain from nerve damage it makes many cats unable to use their litter boxes because scratching the gravel hurts too much or if they still use it they are suffering also many cats start to bite this is because they no longer have their main form of defense this can make them bite out of fear and if heaven forbid she should get out get lost she will have no way to defend herself or to catch food anyway that said here are several suggestions i don't know if you have any of the carpet pieces left but if you do or if you can get a small piece this is what you do take a scratching post and nail a piece of the carpet around it put the post somewhere and bring the cat to it take her paws gently pull them down the post giving her the idea it worked for one of my cats if you do not have any carpet pieces left try this i know you said you bought her sisal posts they also sell scratching posts made with carpet around it that's for cats who obviously love to scratch carpets buy her or of those train her the same way every time you see her start to go for your carpet yell no and pick her up bring her to the post train again it takes a lot of dedication to train some of them away from carpets for one of my cats i had to buy a very small area rug just for her i didn't put it on the carpet she liked because that would have been too confusing i put it outside the room with the carpet so when she started on my carpet i picked her up put her on her own little rug it worked with my current angels i have come to enjoy the beautiful wood floors that were under my carpets best of luck to you  Cat Piccolo Junior Saga Ferret Drill bit Carpet Pittsburgh Steelers The Inside Milton H.

my cat has just had kittens minutes ago help she gave birth minutes to good looking kittens this ismy first experience to my cat having kittens she has cleaned then up nicly and the of them are snuggling together in a box that i have set up for them how long will it be before they start feeding and how can i check if the mom has milk to be honest i don't think she does so how to check and if she doesn't what can i do she doesn't seem to have teats just tiny nipples congratulations i so wish i had little kittens to care for right now most likely mama cat does have milk the last cat i was fostering had very tiny nipples when she gave birth but was also producing milk her nipples got bigger later on the kittens should suckle every two hours or so you can check and see if any milk is coming out when the kittens are suckling the area around the nipples should be puffy however if you're not sure you can ask a vet i've never milked a cat before to check i've raised many new litters of kittens and i'll tell you all the advice i know do not handle the kittens at first if you want to pet them or hold them do so but only for a few minutes and then let them be with their mother each week of their live increase your time with them at week hold them for minutes at two weeks hold them for minutes at three weeks hold them for minutes etc soon they'll be playing with you and you can spend all the time you want with them it is very important that you do handle the kittens some so they will become socialized to people the fact that you are handling them now will mean they are most likely going to be sweet lap cats however again do not handle them too much at first they need to be with their mom for the most part and learn how to be a cat and what the rules are for their species the kittens should be ready to begin weaning to solids around weeks but they will still continue to suckle during that time do not pressure them as each cat has its own time when it is ready to eat solid food do not force feed them solid food most likely your kittens will play with the food and roll around in it before they ever eat it however they're becoming exposed to it use a mushy wet kitten food at first instead of crunchy food they will see mama eating it and understand that they are to eat it too with my last batch i had kittens kitten ate right away another kitten ate a week later the last kitten the runt didn't eat solids until two weeks after his brothers began eating it however if the kitten isn't eating solids around weeks you may have an issue there also get a small shallow pan and put a very small amount of water in there again mama will drink the water and the kittens will observe also again they'll end up rolling in the water which is hysterical to watch i hope you don't need sleep if the kittens and mama stay in your room with you you'll be awake for the next few months it's worth it though kitten proof your house as they get into everything do not give cats cow's milk it gives them diarrhea my advice is to never give away animals in the newspaper i don't know if you're keeping these kittens or already have homes lined up for them contact a local cat rescue when they are ready to go i recommend weeks not weeks if you need help finding a local cat rescue in your area you may send me an email and i will be more than happy to help you cat rescues will give the kittens to fosters where instead of your kitten being in a cage at the shelter waiting for adoption the kitten will live in a house with someone who is qualified to give them all the care that they will ever need the kitten will get to run around a house and cuddle up on the couch while it is waiting for adoption plus the kittens will have their shots and be spayed neutered before they ever go to their new homes it's a great first start in life for kittens don't give them away for free in a paper there are some sick people out there who will do anything to a free cat it's sad but true get mama a very good brand of kitten food to eat instead of her adult cat food she'll pass on those nutrients in her milk to the kittens go to wal mart and get some toys for later kittens are just too cute again i've delivered so many kittens in my life and raised them email me if you need help  Domestic rabbit Hamster Dog Ferret Dairy Feral cat RuneScape quests Garfield

why do kittens go crazy at night her name is delilah and she's almost two months old she lives with with two other dogs in the house but is alone when it's bed time every night before i'm about to go to sleep she goes nuts bouncing from the bed to one corner at lightning speed she will also attack anything that moves the slightest bit i'll try to play with her for a bit so i can get some rest but nothing works and if i try to ignore it and go to bed she'll attack everything from my toes hands shoulders and eyes is there anything i can do cats are crepuscular which means they are most active at dusk and dawn however they play all throughout the night she is just being a very normal healthy playful kitten the only thing you can do is learn to sleep with a bouncing kitten around you if you put her in another room make sure that room is kitten proofed kittens will get into everything and they learn how to climb very quickly get her some toys to amuse herself with a cardboard toilet paper roll is a great toy for kittens i wouldn't give her string actually as she could get tangled in it and choke herself when you're asleep wal mart has a bag of assorted cat toys for and it's well worth the investment my cat zoe got of those bags and he plays with them every day also get her a scratching post for at wal mart it will save your furniture later just be patient your kitten is still a baby and she will eventually tire herself out and hopefully cuddle in beside you before you go to bed though give her a long play session i use one of those cat fishing poles with the feather thingy on the end and i made my kittens run around chasing it for about half an hour before i went to bed they still played for a little while i had kittens bouncing around on me but soon they became exhausted and curled up next to me and went to sleep however once the sun was beginning to come up they were back to playing again just be patient with delilah  Ferret Fancy rat Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mattress Toilet humour Guinea pig Hamster Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Dean Koontz Blood (computer game) Manx (cat) Urinary incontinence Four square EastEnders Sin City Pet skunk Dog Out-of-body experience Thermoregulation Shen Gong Wu Kitten Shaggy dog story Fast bowling Softball Professional wrestling holds Narcolepsy Phoebe Buffay's songs 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Professional wrestling attacks Table tennis Dialysis The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Professional wrestling throws Palindrome Ron and Fez The Contender (television series) Jam (TV series) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Insomnia Kodocha 1957 World Series Strap-on dildo Darkwing Duck Badly Drawn Kitties 2000 Australian Grand Prix Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Bon Jovi Milton H.

introducing new cat not upd on shots i found a tame stray kitten outside recently and i guess he's about months old i had been keeping him at my boyfriends till i could get him fixed upd on shots but he's tired of him so i'd like to bring him to my apartment but i already have a cat and dog the stray cat appears healthy playful etc but i haven't wanted to bring him yet b c i worry about contagious diseases this cat might be carrying and give to my cat so basically i'm wondering if it's okay to bring this cat over to my place he's getting fixed shots upd on or is there a high risk of him possibly giving something to my cat also would indirect contact be okay like letting the kitten walk around my apartment to get his smell around but keeping my cat locked in my room my cat is fixed and utd on shots if the stray has not been tested for feline leukemia then you are placing your other cat at high risk not sure where these other folks got their info from but you should never mix cats until the newest addition has been checked for things like feline leukemia because it is highly contagious and once spread it cannot be stopped and it kills read any cat health books about integrating new animals if you must keep it away from your other animals in a totally different room with totally different food bowls water bowls and litter boxes i have a multicat household so i know what i am talking about also things like ear mites etc are very contagious easily cured but contagious so why risk it it is the same basic reason as to why they do not let kids go to school without being vaccinated first get a clean bill of health before you risk an outbreak same with our animal friends  Cat Pet skunk Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Dog Garfield Tobacco smoking Tuberculosis Smallpox Rabies Manx (cat) Kitten Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Hamster Kevin and Kell Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Measles Columbine High School massacre Diseases of the honeybee H5N1 Canine parvovirus Leukemia Prostate cancer Feral Guinea pig Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Fast bowling Ferret Herpes simplex virus Ebola Foot-and-mouth disease Canary Tick The Inside Taboo food and drink Cancer Pneumonia Sin City Psoriasis Jam (TV series) The Star Wars Holiday Special Dairy Felix the Cat The Cat in the Hat Socialization Marburg virus RuneScape quests The Invisibles Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Transmission (medicine) Avian influenza Colorectal cancer Feline leukemia virus Azumanga Daioh Quarantine Thimerosal AIDS Care Bears Influenza Livestock Dog agility Kodocha Animal rights Diabetes mellitus Stem cell Vaccination Cytomegalovirus Avenue Q Feline immunodeficiency virus Heartworm The X-Files (season 1) The Shining (film) Bioterrorism Phoebe Buffay's songs Common cold Island Fox Cheetah Japanese tea ceremony Team Fortress Classic Folic acid Great Teacher Onizuka Pandemic Coeliac disease Catwoman Foodborne illness Puma Infectious disease

how do i transition into using new cat litter without my cat peeing outside the box i just rescued a cat and he came with a ton of unused litter unfortunately it smells awful and i found some new stuff that doesn't smell like litter at all and i want to use it i put a new litter box with the new stuff in his room with the old box he isn't using the new box which isn't a surprise to me because he's used to it if i take away the old one will that cause him to pee on my carpet instead it could cats do not like change he is also probably still traumatized from moving to a new environment i would suggest slowly mixing the new litter in with the old gradually increase the new litter and decrease the old you may even have to do it a handful at a time until he is ok with the new stuff  Cat Toxoplasmosis Hamster Pet skunk Tobacco smoking Shaggy dog story Jumpstart 3rd Grade Cat litter Domestic rabbit Kurt Cobain Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Deforestation Toilet humour The Best Page in the Universe Computed tomography Aqua Teen Hunger Force Guinea pig Magical objects in Harry Potter Kitten Collision detection Invader Zim Fancy rat Eucalyptus The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Manx (cat) Vegeta Kim Possible Fruits Basket Entropy Ozone depletion Phoebe Buffay Feral cat Mac OS X The Star Wars Holiday Special Red Squirrel Rei Ayanami Naruto jutsu Esperanto grammar Codename: Kids Next Door Major League Baseball television contracts Enzyme Dog Brown Bear RuneScape locations Ozone hole Cheshire cat Russian joke The Strangerhood Traumatic brain injury Menstrual cycle Firefighter SpongeBob SquarePants Litter Sleep Sin City Diseases of the honeybee Albatross Sulfur V (TV series) Wonder Woman (television series) The Inside Particle in a box Apt Pupil Dean Koontz Bong Combine (Half-Life 2) Alien (film) Species Tank Electrophysiology Guns, Germs, and Steel Jackass: The Movie Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Steel The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Red Dwarf characters Mercury Cougar Time travel Tick Characters of Naruto Gross domestic product Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Ron Weasley Ron and Fez Natural Selection (computer game) W.

female tabby cat is very territorial loyal help there was a time where all three of us my parents and i left my cat at home and had my grandma come to the house to feed maui our cat while we were gone the cat attacked grandma from behind by grabbing and scratching her leg and biting her leg my grandma got cut pretty bad and had to go to the emergency room today my family and i were at our various jobs and grandma had to come by to tidy up the house because potential buyers of our house were going to come by and look at it my grandma wore long pants and taped her legs to protect herself once again the cat attacked her but this time not from behind my grandma was facing her when maui attacked her luckily she wasn't hurt as bad because of the extra protection maui doesn't act like this with my parents and i but she really doesn't like any strangers she is not the kind of cat that hides she will confront people and growl and hiss any suggestions please help it's true that cats are very territorial they also rely very heavily on their sense of smell does your grandma have any pets of her own perhaps the scent of another animal or even the fact that your grandma doesn't have the communal scent of your home might have made maui feel threatened when cats are afraid they have two basic reactions flight or fight maui might have lashed out at your grandma because she was the source of the unfamiliar scent or simply because she was the nearest person to take her aggression out on it also sounds like you may be in the process of moving home is there a lot of upheaval and packing going on at the moment this could be making maui feel stressed territory is very important to a cat it's their source of food love and shelter if they feel that they may be about to lose all that they can become very aggressive in defending it is she allowed outside at all if she's an indoor only cat would you consider allowing her outside for brief periods either on a harness or under supervision this would help take the focus off your home as the centre of her existence and make her less likely to exhibit territorial behaviour indoors feliway is a produce that containing pheromones that have a calming effect on cats perhaps you could purchase a bottle and spray visitors just before maui next meets them to see if this will help her to be more accepting of them eventually she will become accustomed to them the web sites below offer advice on feline aggression towards humans and moving to a new home with your cat http www sniksnak com cathealth fear html http www allaboutpets org uk web site aap factsheetlist asp mainpettype hope your grandma is okay she must be a real animal lover to have risked being attacked a second time good luck in finding a solution  Cat Dog Animal communication Housebreaking Pet skunk Dog training EastEnders Pitaten Ferret Social rule Theory of conduct God Emperor of Dune Breastfeeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fruits Basket Ranma __ characters World Wide Web Maison Ikkoku Domestic rabbit Skunk House Mouse Kakapo SpongeBob SquarePants Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Shark Tenshinhan Felis sapiens Natural Selection (computer game) The Death Gate Cycle Fancy rat Insect The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Ant Olfaction Hamster Trademark Fiddler on the Roof Aikido Ajax (programming) The Amazing Race Attachment theory Paranoia Agent Socialization Garfield Rocko's Modern Life Friends Mutual fund Cross site scripting Professional wrestling holds Kasparov versus The World One Tree Hill (TV series) Martial art Beavis and Butt-head Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma LiveJournal Gray Wolf Galaxy Angel Narcissism Spanking The Amber Spyglass Plame affair Organic farming Royal Assent Karen Horney FoxTrot Neopets Force (Star Wars) Monster Rancher monsters Tyrannosaurus rex The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Alignment (role-playing games) Emergence The Star Wars Holiday Special Glossary of climbing terms Poker jargon Storytelling Uniform Resource Locator American Black Bear Agriculture The Dalek Invasion of Earth Infantilism Equine conformation Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism HTTP cookie Battle of France Oh My Goddess!

i am fearful that the euthanasia didn't work is it possible i'm scared my cat wasn't 'put to sleep' properly because when she was passed to me wrapped in a blanket she was still warm the vet did check for a heartbeat afterwards he said there wasn't one i even looked at her and pressed my hand against her stomach chest and she wasn't breathing she has since been buried and i'm so scared i buried her when she was still alive i'm just so scared her heart could have restarted is this just an irrational thought because i am grieving purrs and prayers to you for your loss a cat's normal body temperature is a little higher than ours averaging about degrees so she would feel 'warm' to you the drug used for euthanasia is very effective and causes a quick and gentle death the concerns you are having for burying her prematurely are part of your grief over her death you are going thru the natural and normal grief process the steps are shock denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance please go to petloss com they have excellent pet grief help  Grief First aid Cat EastEnders Anxiety Characters in the Smurfs Cardiac arrhythmia Drowning Milton H.

my pregnant cat just had a bloody stool is this indicating the time is near it was confirmed that she's pregnant by the vet however he said he couldn't tell us the delivery date it would be based on when she was last in heat so we're counting days from when we heard the mating lol she's pinking and showing and very affectionate and it appears she's nesting however if our calculations are right she shouldnt be due till next week i know you are worried and that's great it may not be much comfort but cats are way better at having babies than humans are they rarely need any help the number one indicator that her time is near is that she'll disappear you'll find her in a closet or something and there will be pairs of eyes just don't stress keep petting her keep loving her make her a little nest of towels and old sheets nature will take it's course  Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Garfield Cat EastEnders Animal communication Obstetrics Childbirth Hamster Pet skunk Friends Toxoplasmosis Neighbours House Mouse Upholstery Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding T'Pol Cytomegalovirus Phoebe Buffay's songs Knots Landing Code: Lyoko Dog Fecal incontinence Series finale Bengali language Dead Like Me Something Positive Melanie Wilkes Schistosomiasis Shaggy dog story Chinchilla Guinea pig Felis sapiens Days of our Lives Diarrhea Jon Secada Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Infantilism Laci Peterson Maya calendar Ferret Episodes of Lost (Season 1) New Zealand English Estrus cycle Platypus Abortion Sharon Tate Psoriasis Coeliac disease Stewie Griffin Douglas Adams Negima Elephant Dairy Zoophilia Domestic rabbit Richard Chase Street-Legal Solar variation Panthera hybrid Albatross Giant Panda Chinese calendar Socialization Red Squirrel 10cc Stuttering Pink Pigeon The Pet Sounds Sessions The Marriage of Figaro Gregorian calendar Grief Philip J.

is it ever too late for a cat to get shots i got my cat in the beggining of last summer and she was already like a couple of months old so right now shes like years old she already had litters but i'm thinking about getting her spayed no it really isn't too late for either one even if your cat is already infected with one of the diseases they are vaccinating for the vaccines will not harm the cat and according to some studies they may even help slightly when i found my cat she had a respiratory infection that was likely caused by one of the diseases she was later vaccinated against of course the best reason is to make sure that she is protected against diseases she does not already have i also agree with the poster above who recommended getting her spayed at the same time there are too many cats out there and not enough homes my cat was a stray herself and she was so sick she almost died as a kitten it breaks my heart thinking about it as soon as she was old enough i got her spayed so that i would not contribute to the problem please help reduce the number of strays by spaying your cat good luck here's to many happy years with your healthier vaccinated kitty  Cat Domestic rabbit Dog Feral cat Kitten Pet skunk Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Rabies Vaccine Influenza AIDS Pneumonia Tuberculosis Smallpox H5N1 MMR vaccine Autism epidemic HIV vaccine Ferret Herpes simplex virus Cancer Guinea pig Vaccination Malaria Chronic fatigue syndrome Poliomyelitis Diphtheria Human papillomavirus Asthma Measles Marburg virus Medical analysis of circumcision Antiviral drug Bioterrorism 2001 UK foot and mouth crisis Toxoplasmosis Asbestos Tobacco smoking Socialization Foot-and-mouth disease Vaccine controversy Thimerosal Influenza pandemic Cytomegalovirus Andrew Wakefield Alzheimer's disease Sickle-cell disease Cervical cancer Pertussis Autism Cocaine Lyme disease Virus Diabetes mellitus DDT Chagas disease Microeconomics Group A streptococcal infection Breastfeeding Anthrax Colorectal cancer HIV test Rocky Mountain spotted fever Natural Hygiene Mumps Medicine Tick Streptococcus pneumoniae Mathematical modelling in epidemiology Heartworm Biological warfare Animal shelter Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Sexually-transmitted infection Pitaten Omega-3 fatty acid Pathogen Disease Hamster Tetanus Urinary incontinence Spanish flu Infectious disease HIV Sleeping sickness Legionellosis Psoriasis Adverse effect (medicine) Louis Pasteur Leptospirosis Prostate cancer Cystic fibrosis Obesity Luck Avian influenza

my best friend is really getting on my nerves please help it's important okay so my best friend and i have been best friends for over years we know everything about each other and that could come as a problem if i ever wanted to leave i know her and she would spread every secret i had to the entire world she gets really annoying and immature at times when it is not appropriate she tries to hurt my feelings saying she is so much prettier than me and she can do everything better etc after years of her saying this i believed it and now i see what she was really trying to do break down my self esteem i have been depressed for about and starting just this summer i am finally happy again every time i talk with her she tries to tell me these things and that's why i hate talking with her we also make plans and then an hour before she is suppose to pick me up she's like oh didn't i tell you i already went yesterday she hasn't come to my birthday parties ever she's sick the sad part is that she is really the best best i know i am in the cat section i forgot to change the things i've had friends like that before and it took me a long time to realize what they were really up to good for you for realizing that this isn't a healthy relationship and reaching out for help you don't say how old you are so it's a little difficult to give really age specific advice when it comes to friendships things change a lot between the ages of and after that we're supposedly mature adults and it's basically the same my suggestions are as follows talk to her about it she might not really realize that she's doing these things and you may really do her a favor by bringing this to her attention phrase it by saying something like you know insert her name here the other day my feelings were really hurt when you did whatever she did or said or didn't do and i don't think that you intended to hurt my feelings but i feel like i need to bring it up from there hopefully she'll say something like oh no i never meant to hurt your feelings i'm sorry or something like that ask her to please be aware of when she is saying these things and whenever she does something that hurts you let her know your feelings are important and they deserve to be respected what should raise red flags is if she starts making excuses for why she did that thing starts telling you that you're a wimp or something like that for feeling that way or other berating such as that real friends help build you up they don't push you down if that doesn't work then i suggest spending less time with her don't allow yourself to be her punching bag don't just stay her friend because she knows your secrets if you feel the need to confide in someone i suggest that you look to other friends who you know won't hurt you a person in the clergy or even a parent or sibling you deserve to feel safe hopefully you don't feel so alone in this i had a friend who i would have run in front of a bus for who i loved dearly but who i ended up needing to break off the friendship with because her morals and priorities were completely out of sync with mine i finally realized that her calling me names was not what a real friendship was about and after a whole lot of tears and sadness i decided that i would not and could not subject myself to that kind of friend i mourn the loss of her friendship but i feel much stronger within myself because i know i did what was right for me good luck and i hope everything works out  Pitaten Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule Theory of conduct Kodocha EastEnders Knots Landing Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Piccolo Junior Saga God Emperor of Dune Big Brother (USA TV series) Ty Cobb The Smoking Room Narcissism Cindy Sheehan Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jon Secada The Emancipation of Mimi Pok__mon Live!

crazy wild cat help needed i found this tiny kitten about two years ago in the gutter she had oil on her and was desperately hungry she was so young definitely not young enough to leave her mother she wasn't even ready to eat regular cat food yet the way she acted and bonded with my dog i am guessing she never ever had a mother she was wild she treats my dog like her mom unfortunately she hasn't taken to humans i played with her as a kitten and held her everyday i still hold her and interact with her all the time giving her lots of attention however she stil hisses and spits and acts crazy all the time she acts very wild and is very susipicious of anyone even me she sees my other two cats walk on me and let me hold them and i can play with my crazy cat and my other cats all the time and she joins in and loves it she gets along with my youngest cat pretty well however she still doesn't let me love her what do i do sad to say that some wild cats never really change even with years of love we have four barn cats that were born there and have had them for four years they still will barely let us touch them let alone hold them some cats just have it set in their mind that they don't won't adjust to humans but slowly they are coming around letting us pet them a little more each day they still scatter sometimes when we come out to the barn try seeing if ignoring her will make her curious to where she will come to you most of the time cats will choose when they want to be loved and when they don't one of my indoor cats trip hisses or growls even swats when he doesn't want to be held anymore it is just their nature and way of saying okay thats enough she is young it will take alot of time for her to adjust just as it is with my wild barn cats it has been years and we can't even hold them so don't get discouraged the good thing is is that you can hold her and pet her when she starts acting crazy leave her alone until she decides to come and get more goodluck  Cat Phoebe Buffay's songs Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Pet skunk Socialization Garfield Milton H.

puncture wounds they are healed fine one leg was just broken laying sideways splinted she is learning to use it second back leg had a bone sticking out vet splinted it gave it antibiotics we change the dressing every days per vet it is better but still has a dime sized open area right over the bone but appears to be closing up slowly in no pain it just looks so terrible when this cat walks with the foot on the leg laying sideways sweetest cat you ever seen she wants to keep it her parents said ok to staying indoors but her parents will not help do anything with food vet etc amputation costs vet said i cannot afford it for her is it possible this open area can heal more still the cat live pain free or do i need to fork out the additional bucks to put it to sleep for her i buy it's food vet now before you do anything talk with the vet and see if it does need amputation also you probably have already done this but make sure the cat is current on its rabies vaccinations as raccoons are

crime property loss or a job layoff and are experiencing a temporary financial hardship making it too difficult to afford pet care and some animals brought to clinics by good samaritans don't have an owner to pay for treatment whatever the situation the fact remains the same when sick or injured animals are unable to receive veterinary care they suffer through the aaha helping pets fund veterinary

cats sick my cat has been sneezing since yesteday nothing major i think he might have a cold problem is i do not have money to spend to take him to the vet i dont even have moeny for my own health care right now i was wondering if it would be safe to take a very small dose of dayquill and mix it the water again just alittle bit or will he get better on his own also can i give him herbs such as ecancheia sp thanks tom cats have a phenomenal ability to heal themselves i would not give him any cough syrup or herbs if you think he's sick check his temp rectally cats run around normally if he has no other symptoms than sneezing it could be a seasonal allergy or time to dust if the sneezing turns into wheezing and difficulty breathing or any nasal discharge he probably will have bronchitis or pneumonia you can get a nasal bulb syringe to suck out the discharge and use otc saline spray to break things up go to an herbal store for specifics on cats by the way cats are not used for animal testing of products because they are radically different from us so don't assume if it's ok for a person it will work for your cat we have worked out a barter system with our vet we seem to get all the strays in the county currently cats kittens your vet might appreciate having someone do some cleaning or other work in exchange for services  Hay fever Common cold Asthma Cat Influenza Pneumonia Guinea pig Allergy Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Sneeze Pet skunk Ferret Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Medical prescription Fancy rat Aspergillosis Medicine Domestic rabbit Rabies Urinary incontinence Nasal congestion Computed tomography Tuberculosis Traditional Chinese medicine First aid kit Cancer Jala neti H5N1 Pulmonary alveolus Barter Homeopathy Haloalkane Prostate cancer The Secret of NIMH Abortion Traumatic brain injury Hepatitis C Natural health Aloe Sinusitis Nasal irrigation Thermal power station Hamster Disease Patent medicine Legionellosis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Biological warfare Cough medicine Diabetes mellitus Mercury (element) Vampire Vitamin C Decompression sickness Veterinarian Herbalism Diazepam Anesthesia Coffee Babe Ruth Aspartame Nasal spray Nuclear fallout Blood (computer game) Bronchitis Yarrow The Amber Spyglass Coeliac disease Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Diagon Alley Hyperthermia Alternative medicine Group A streptococcal infection Dog Hypoglycemia Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Charles Darwin's illness Cocaine Ayurveda Chlamydophila pneumoniae Smoke-screen Feral cat Garfield Fecal incontinence Brewery Botulism Clinical depression Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Azumanga Daioh Mosquito Vinegar Social rule Fire extinguisher Nepeta

pulling a tooth on a kitten a few days ago my cat looked like it broke its bottom canine tooth i was hanging out of his mouth hurting his lip in the process it was only hanging on by a piece of the roots so what i did was grabbed a needle nose pliers and removed it from the mouth after removing the tooth we found that his adult tooth was starting to come out i'm just wondering since it broke off and the roots didn't come out will this hurt the cat in anyway the cat doesn't seem like its in anymore pain and can eat normally again anyone gone through this and did it turn out okay let me clarify for you gramma's baby the tooth was already out was only hanging on by a thread of root haven't you had a parent pull out a tooth that was already loose so its not like i had to hold him down and work for mins to get it out it took me seconds to remove it because it was already broken and my cat couldn't eat because he was in pain from the tooth jabbing him in the cheek i'm looking for people to answer that have gone through this if the root didn't come out with the tooth will that harm the gums your cat will be fine my question is are you talking about a cat or a kitten it sounds like a kitten i had to take my kitten to the vet to get a tooth pulled because it had been really bothering her for two days and she wouldn't let me anywhere near her mouth the vet reached in and gave a quick yank and it came right out a week later i managed to reach in and pull two more teeth that were hanging on and causing her similar discomfort after a little while the bleeding stopped and my kitten was fine she didn't even remember it had happened all of these teeth that we pulled were just like you said hanging on by a thread the kitten just need a little help getting them out this is normal there is nothing wrong or cruel about what you did i think most people would have just used their fingers instead of pliers but those little teeth can be difficult to grab because at least with my cat they tend to salivate more and there can be some blood when they are about to lose a tooth the pliers probably just gave you leverage so you could get in and get out as quickly as possible to minimize the discomfort on the kitten  Ferret Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Garfield Drill bit Piccolo Junior Saga Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Diving Characters of Naruto Domestic rabbit Cocaine StarCraft: Uprising Textile manufacturing Tobacco Professional wrestling holds Breastfeeding Dental caries Tooth enamel Milton H.

how at risk is my cat my sister owns both a diabetic and a felv cat and a few other cats the diabetic and felv are kept in seperate rooms however the diabetic has some interaction with one of her other cats the diabetic must travel with her to my house when she comes to visit is this putting my cat at risk i am not concerned about the diabetes that is just the reason the cat needs to come out with her when she visits it is the felv that concerns me diabetes is not contageous so that won't affect your cat but my bigger concern is that felv cat because it can spread it's germs to the diabetic cat she is bringing and then it can carry those germs to your cat is your cat vaccinated against felv if not then i suggest you get it vaccinated and also that you ask your sister to keep her cat she is bringing in a cage the entire time it is at your home and keep the cage away from your cat i'm talking about a run around cage like the two decker ferret kitten cages or a large dog cage that can contain a liter box and food and water if she won't bring one then i would purchase one myself and request her cat be kept in it or then she can't bring the cat you surely do not need a sick kitty yourself if the felv spreads good luck i hope her diabetic cat is vaccinated against the disease but even if it is it can still carry the germ to your cat even if it doesn't get the diesease itself check with your vet very soon on that  Ferret Hamster Pet skunk Domestic rabbit Rabies Malaria Guns, Germs, and Steel Influenza pandemic Guinea pig Cat RuneScape quests Garfield Socialization Hypoglycemia Adverse effect (medicine) Tuberculosis H5N1 Colorectal cancer Leopard Coeliac disease Kitten Prostate cancer Smallpox Dog Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cats (musical) Pneumonia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Fancy rat Precautionary principle Poliomyelitis Milk Hyperglycemia Insulin Betting (poker) Stroke Alzheimer's disease Animal Crossing Obstetrics Louis Pasteur Crohn's disease Professional wrestling match types Bioterrorism Medicine Kakapo Singaporean measures against avian influenza Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Genetically modified food Vaccination Feral cat colony Equine conformation Ionizing radiation Microchip implant (animal) Vegetarianism 2001 UK foot and mouth crisis Felix the Cat Poker jargon Care Bears RuneScape locations Feral cat Ron Weasley Siamese (cat) Livestock Tooth enamel The Amazing Race Dialysis Badly Drawn Kitties Ernest Hemingway Island Fox Little Britain Public health Externality Luck Domestication Chagas disease Cat on a Hot Tin Roof Biological warfare Pet store Autism epidemic Glucokinase Chronic fatigue syndrome Atkins Nutritional Approach Cancer Sexually-transmitted infection Folic acid HIV vaccine Andr__s Galarraga Veterinarian Canary Thimerosal Dieting Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Sheaf (mathematics) Immortality The Catcher in the Rye Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Clozapine

introducing week old kitten to my month old kitten i have had my month old male kitten for a little over a month now and i wanted to get him a friend i brought home week old male kitten my month old kitten keep pouncing on and wrestling with the week old kitten it seems like he is being really ruff at times and its constant he isnt giving the other kitten a break is this normal or should i be concerned i seperated them the first day between bedrooms i let the little one out once in awhile is this ever going to end that should really be not much of a problem your boys are still both kittens and are going to roughhouse and chew on each other at least it's each other and not your furniture or your shoes and congratulations for having two kittens they need each other to keep one another company if you decide that your older boy is being too rough you can push them apart it won't hurt to separate them for a short while but if you leave your house let them be together the little guy can fend for himself they're just playing and getting to know each other they're just kids tell them to knock it off and settle down for a little bit separate food bowls are recommended they can share water when you get them fixed i know you don't have any females but if you get them fixed early you avoid much chance they will learn to spray they need to recover from the anesthesia totally separately and can then spend time together your vet may want to wait until your week old is months old but you really don't have to wait that long we've done boys as early as weeks but most vets will want to wait this was a mass population control thing  Atomic Kitten Ferret Cat Phoebe Buffay's songs Garfield Guinea pig Kitten Pet skunk Eddie Guerrero Social rule RuneScape quests Dog training Big Brother UK series 5 Kurt Angle Breastfeeding Socialization Urinary incontinence Shaggy dog story Shawn Michaels Pet Sounds Hamster The Contender (television series) Vegeta Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) The Jazz Singer She Loves You Jon Secada Piccolo Junior Saga Manx (cat) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Prostate cancer TNA Unbreakable Sin City Treecat National Football League Big Brother (USA TV series) Pretty Good Privacy Journey (band) Good Times About a Boy ALGOL 68 1957 World Series Cleveland Browns Son Gohan Friends Super Bowl XXVII Elephant Planet Jarrett Domestic rabbit Poker jargon Super Bowl XXXVI Chris Benoit Feral cat Equine conformation Hey Jude Ron and Fez Yom Kippur War Second Battle of the Atlantic Sarah Kerrigan Fancy rat The Marshall Mathers LP Cliff Richard Sewage treatment Michael Garibaldi Professional wrestling slang Full Metal Panic?

please help i just found out that my really sick cat has an upper respiratory problem and the vet is making him stay for the night he has problems breathing and has a high fever the vet says that he has some fluids in his cavity and that made me worried sick i need to know any website that could help me understand this better the vet sounded as if my cat could die please help me find another way to heal my cat if not keep him alive longer ' hi hun i am so sorry that your kitty is so very sick but your best bet all the way around is listen to your vet and anything that he she says that you don't understand ask them to explain speak up you say the vet sounded like your cat may die come right out and ask them what the prognosis the outcome best case scenerio worst case scenerio is for this type of respiratory infection a lot depends on the age of your cat and you didn't say how old he is unfortunately i do not believe that any web site can be of much help to you because they all speak in generalities and you can't do this when you are dealing with a serious medical problem i surely would not trust any web site including the forum right here with the life of my cat my child or my own life your own vet has your cat right there in front of him her and your own vet knows what is going on now i know that this may sound cold but it surely is not meant to be but depending on the age of your cat yrs or younger probably a good chance that he'll pull thru much older and depending on what your vet tells you as to the expected out come of this sometimes as much as it hurts and yes it is going to you just have to let go and have the cat put down i cannot imagine why you would want to extend his life if the poor thing is going to be in constant misery this is very cruel to your kitty yes i know that many many people do this keep them alive under any all circumstances this is for strictly selfish purposes because these people just can't let go and sometimes we just have to as much as we hate to do it but if your vet tells you that this does not look good and that he is not responding to the medications do yourself a favor and i hate to say it this way because i'd be shattered too but cut your losses now and have your vet put him down and get him out of this misery if this infection is really bad all you're going to do by trying to extend his life is continue to have a sick cat perhaps many more trips back to the vet who will most likely die on his own if he is gasping for every breath he is not going to be able to eat or drink and if the infection itself doesn't kill him he will surely die of dehydration and or starvation please don't do this to your kitty in the end all you will be left with is one dead cat and still an enormous vet bill to pay off now it's a totally different thing if your vet says that he is responding well to the medications that his fever is down and you can tell yourself just by looking at him if he appears to be breathing much easier then yes you will want the vet to perhaps keep him in there another day and this would be for reasons to ensure that your kitty is getting the best of care and getting stronger before you bring him back home and ask your vet if this type of infection is infectious contageous and if there is anything special you need to do to your home kitty's bedding etc to prevent him from getting re infected with this and if so you will need to keep him at the vets office for that extra day while you do some serious cleaning with a product that is an anti bacterial anti viral cleaner ask your vet what to use they may carry some type of product there in the office that you can buy right there that you cannot get at any store i'd start with the litter box and go from there and if by chance the litter box is getting a little worn out quite frankly i'd replace it rather than cleaning it if it's in good shape take it to the bath tub put to ths cup of bleach in the litter box and fill the whole thing up with very hot water under normal circumstances you never want to use bleach to clean the litter box cats have very sensitive noses and they hate the smell of bleach also pine sol and citrus cleaners but in this case if you thoroughly rinse it out with hot water then take it outdoors and allow it to sun air dry leave it out there most of the day this will kill any of the bleach smell then follow your vets instructions as far as cleaning the rest of your home and finally before you're ready to bring your kitty back home ask your vet if there is a vaccine to prevent this sounds like pneumonia to me your cat from getting this again if so how soon can he be given this i doubt that the vet will give him the shot while he is still on anti biotics and still recovering from this 'bout but if available do make sure that just as soon as possible you get kitty in there to get this shot i know you don't want him going thru this again and finally on behalf of all of us on this forum we're all pullin' for you and your kitty for the very best out come on this situation and for a speedy recovery for kitty also if this has been an indoor outdoor cat after this please consider keeping him as an inside only cat this is just one example of what can happen to cats who are allowed to go outdoors they catch these type of infections and worse from other cats there is really nothing good out there for a cat to get into except trouble it is a proven fact that indoor only cats live at least twice as long as a cat who is allowed outdoors best of luck for a good outcome and a speedy recovery for your kitty please let us know or at least you can e mail me and let me know how he is doing god bless you for getting kitty to your vet asap  Poker jargon Common cold Social rule Guinea

what colour is my cat my hubby insists rio is a silver tabby i say tortoise shell http img imageshack us my php image riopiccx jpg nommo you're so sweet to me xx the vet told me he was a tortoise shell i thought he was a bit dark to be a silver tab he looks a bit greenish black oh well hubby wins so i am slave for a day your cat is definitely a tabby the definition if you will of tortoise shell is a female cat that has a mixture or patches of orange and brown could be solid or tabby markings if rio is a male cat then that alone would disqualify him from being a torti because the color combination of orange and black can only occur in female cats same with calico cats which have orange black and white coat colors if a cat is a torti or calico then you can bet your bottom dollar that the cat is female the reason why the colors orange and black cannot co exist in a male cat is complicated and cannot be explained without giving you a lesson in genetics and how the genetic codes for those two colors are not compatible to produce an offspring with an xy chromosome i e male so take my word on this one either way male or female just by looking at this pic and seeing the lack of orange coat pattern in this kitty plus the presence of white patches on neck and end of toes makes your cat a tabby of sort and not anything like a tortoise shell  Tabby cat Tortoiseshell cat Cat Tiger Turkish Van Horse Color blindness Color theory Dog Maine Coon Bengal cat Siamese (cat) Leopard Liger Maneki Neko Lion Iris (anatomy) Species Manx (cat) Cheetah Ferret Panthera hybrid Puma Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Southern Pacific Railroad Mitosis Silver Intersexuality Biology and sexual orientation Tincture (heraldry) White tiger Wallpaper group Colours, standards and guidons Roan (color) Chocolate Black Tortoise Casting Object-oriented programming Parthenogenesis African American Vernacular English Pysanka Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Race Oriental Shorthair Black (people) Emergence Eye color Baldness Sex Gene DNA Vehicle registration plate Human skin color Drill bit Androgen insensitivity syndrome Mink Orgasm White (people) Angora (cat) Chlorine Meiosis Traffic sign Fancy rat Hair color Butterfly Discus (fish) Turkish Angora OpenBSD Spider Guinea pig Sulfur Heraldry Sega Dreamcast Felix the Cat Keeshond Rum Photographic film Aluminium Power Rangers Dice Melanin Cell (biology) Y chromosome NTSC Tea Mendelian inheritance Control character Red hair Chimera (genetics) Hamster Tom and Jerry (MGM) Tai shogi HTML element James McNeill Whistler

why does my week old kitten scratch why does my week old kitten scratch around his food bowl the above answer is so far off cats have scent glands in their feet next to urinating and defacating they use those to mark their territory this is also the most important reason why cats scratch their nails on treebarks scratching posts etc to mark their territory yes they get sharpened in the process but they could also sharpen them by removing the top layer that comes off with scrating with their teeth which you can also see many cats do your cat is marking his territory by scratching around his food bowl clearly stating to everyone around i might not be here but this food belongs to me i don't think he would be so protective of his food if he didn't like it  Cat Ferret Pet skunk Kitten Animal communication Guinea pig Territory (animal) Rabbit Fancy rat Hamster Tooth Knife Kakapo Acne Sugar Glider Garfield Skin Socialization Stanley Cup Tattoo Nine Inch Nails Ron and Fez Domestic rabbit Menstrual cycle Manx (cat) Tooth enamel Seabird Potto Gray Wolf Prostate cancer Essential oil Drill bit Insulin Feral cat colony Perfume American lobster Opportunity rover Billboard Hot 100 Pantera Thermoregulation Leaf Treecat Chinchilla Vitamin C Glacier OpenBSD Skunk Cats (musical) Kangaroo House Mouse Azumanga Daioh Clomipramine Discordianism Slide rule Pottery Survival skills Ted Nugent Avalanche Toilet humour B3ta RuneScape quests Ultraviolet Dog Compact disc StarCraft: Hybrid Super Bowl XVII Penis Shark Feline leukemia virus Fur Feral cat Asiatic Golden Cat Sharpening stone Chocolate Chainsaw Saga (band) Burial Spotted Skunk Team Fortress Classic Mandible Human anatomy Housebreaking Rust Bird Phoebe Buffay's songs Kidney Airsoft Fluoride Certified Nursing Assistant Abortion Tlingit Minor Harry Potter Beasts Laserdisc Marking out Philmont Scout Ranch Brown Bear

do you think cats can sense something is going to happen before it happens i had a cat a couple years ago and i was sitting on my bedroom floor placing some good food down on the floor for the cat to eat i don't remember what i think it was some chicken or something point is it was definately a yummy treat that i expected my cat to gobble up instead all of a sudden the cat got all tense and freaked out and was staring inside my closet it just kept looking in there and it's eyes were real big she lost all intrest in the food and ran under the bed no more than minutes later a fire started in that same closet i swear to this day i still don't know how that fire started but it was a serious fire the whole place burnt my family and i made it out unharmed thank goodness but sadly i don't think my poor cat made it out i never saw her after that does anyone besides me think that this cat sensed that something wasn't right or am i crazy for even thinking that thanks and sorry this is so long cpinatsi i'm sorry but i was more worried about getting my two small children out of there than my cat the front door was open while the house was on fire but i think my poor cat died while trying to save her litter of kittens of course i was sad about it but there wasn't much i could do for her cpinatsi by the way i did not give you a thumbs down catloverami i would hope that if when you have children your first thought would be to get them out by the time we realised the fire and got ourselves out the whole bedroom was aflame the house was filling with smoke and windows were exploding so no i did not go back in and try to save my cat they do did you read about all the animals and their reactions during the big tsunami there was another article recently in the paper about a cat in a nursing home who would go to the rooms of patients who it sensed were gonna die the cat has a perfect track record i believe  Shaggy dog story RuneScape quests Milton H.

why does my cat get violent when she smells certain things for example usually its things like dirty clothes but it got really bad when my mom used some icyhot earlier that ointment stuff for pain shes just sitting there growling wont let me pet her scratching and biting me whats up with her shes usually not like this at all and yes she ate but she has me really worried i had the same type of experience with my cat only it was vanilla scented hand lotion that sent her over the edge whenever i used this hand lotion she attacked my hands and did not want to be petted when i stopped using the lotion she returned to her normal sweet self the only thing i could figure out was that cats have very sensitive noses and some scents just hit the panic button in their brains i'm sure some scientist can give a full explanation of what's going on but once the offending odor was removed all was okay as far as the icyhot is concerned that is an odor that can stick around for awhile so air out your house and lock up the icyhot and see what happens i hope kitty will settle down  Cat Teen Girl Squad Olfaction Skunk Sin City Flatulence Eric Cartman Dog Pet skunk Hamster Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Blood (computer game) Sense Fancy rat Animal communication Ferret Poker jargon Domestic rabbit Shaggy dog story Odor Ginny Weasley Inspector Gadget Eczema EastEnders Red Dwarf characters American Black Bear Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Pep__ Le Pew Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Psoriasis Burial 2000 Australian Grand Prix Perfume Kim Possible Kakapo Guinea pig Felis sapiens Static Shock Professional wrestling holds Scent hound Teacher's Pet (Disney) Abduction Phenomenon Fast bowling Catscratch Garfield Tobacco smoking Shoe Phoebe Buffay's songs Police dog Aromatherapy Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Aerial (dance move) Sluggy Freelance Knots Landing One Piece minor characters FoxTrot W.I.T.C.H.

does anyone ave any success stories from taming a wild or feral cat if so how long did it take and what did you i have cats of which were feral for my th cat moggie it only took two days believe it or not i had just moved into my new house and i'd put a powder poision around the perimeter to repel scorpions and spiders one morning i came outside and noticed that there were little kitten prints in the posion and the trash can had been overturned and eaten out of this was my first sign that my other animals and i were not alone lol xd i saw him a few days after that he was a little orange tabby very young and he was sunbathing on the porch i came out quietly and he saw me but he was too afraid to move and so he stayed frozen where he was i sat down at a distance and waited until he got comfortable with me being there and when his attention wavered from me i would quietly scoot closer to him eventually i was right next to him and i snuck up and gave him a pat on the head he tensed for a minute but then started purring and a few minutes later he was snuggled in my lap having a grand old time my newest addition abigail a kitten as well was a harder job to tame i found her on the side of the highway and she followed me all the way back to my home though she hid in the brush and stayed at least feet away from me the whole time a storm was coming so i had to catch her when her back was turned and i put her in my room for the first few days she hid under my bed and hissed and spat at me if i reached for her realizing she was more of a playful kitten than the lap cat type i got a string and lured her out of hiding i distracted her with the string and every now and again i would gently pet her for a split second then withdraw my hand eventually she got used to me and she would let me pet her without the aid of a distractor  Cat Shaggy dog story The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Feral cat RuneScape quests 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Curse of Fenric Poker jargon Aerial (dance move) Xiaolin Showdown Tag Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an New York Giants Socialization Sin City One Piece minor characters Dog training Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Piccolo Junior Saga Tiger Milton H.

why do cats bury their poop they bury it for hygiene and safety reasons cats are by nature very clean animals and the mother teaches her kittens to bury their waste away from the nest so that it doesn't attract parasites in the wild they do it to conceal their scent from predators or in an attempt not to upset more dominant cats in the neighbourhood however cats who live indoors consider us to be the dominant animal and therefore cover the faeces so as not to offend us  Feces Cat Ferret Pet skunk Animal communication Kitten Allergy Manx (cat) Pitaten Dog Feral Feral cat Guinea pig Hamster Kakapo Felis sapiens Puma Alien (film) Domestic rabbit Socialization Dream Sewage Fancy rat Housebreaking Shampoo Hunting Burial Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Predation The Cat in the Hat Cheetah Fox hunting Coprophagia Domestication Camouflage Nile crocodile Asiatic Golden Cat Hedgehog Leopard Livestock Treecat Red Fox Human feces Bat Red Squirrel Toxoplasmosis Albatross Skunk Serial killer Foodborne illness God Emperor of Dune Metroid (video game species) Island restoration Internet phenomenon Beaver Capercaillie Myxobolus cerebralis Tiger Gray Wolf Introduced species Cats (musical) Japanese toilet Rat Boba Fett Taboo food and drink Brown Bear Biblical scientific foresight Perfume Tokyo Mew Mew Leopard Cat Hygiene Ecology Garfield and Friends Composting toilet Ranma __ characters Golden Lion Tamarin The Smoking Room Azumanga Daioh Nest box Kashrut Trailer Park Boys Phantom cat Lavos Olduwan Tenchi Muyo!

my cat's too skinny any ideas on what to feed her to get her to gain some weight my cat about years old seems too thin to me i feed her regularly and keep regular checkups with the vet she's healthy but even the vet said she's a little thin but i don't know what to give her to get her to gain some weight does anyone have and ideas to share with me i've tried canned food treats i don't want to give her table scraps but she still isn't gaining weight thanks i talked to the vet about a prescription food but right now i can't afford it i'm saving up for it but i'm not sure how long it will take you see i'm an intern with a part time job in college so money is tight right now she does eat when i feed her sorry about not making that clear i feed her iams dry food meowmix wet food i follow the feeding instructions even give her more sometimes too as your vet has checked her over and you're saying she's healthy i'm assuming that there are no health problems to explain why she's not putting on weight if she's only a little bit underweight and otherwise in good health you probably don't have to worry too much about her to put weight on her your best bet is to feed her a food formulated for kittens and or lactating queens as these will have the highest calorific content the premium foods are better quality but if you can't afford them some of the better supermarket brands are reasonable if she's happy to eat whatever you feed her hopefully you can change her food over without too many issues even so change over a few days to a week to prevent any gastrointestinal upsets  Breastfeeding Guinea pig Chocolate Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Obesity Hamster Theory of conduct Garfield Domestic rabbit Health insurance Fancy rat Anorexia nervosa Stomach cancer Milk Cat Atkins Nutritional Approach Dairy Folic acid Medical prescription Publicly funded medicine Organic farming Adjustable gastric band Mutual fund Confidence trick Binge eating disorder Food and Drug Administration Dieting Livestock Insurance Gasoline Poker jargon Prostate cancer Nutrition The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Life insurance Wal-Mart Fecal incontinence Diarrhea Veganism Organic food Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Education in Germany Rabies Genetically modified food Kitten Time travel Foie gras Hormone replacement therapy (trans) English grammar Mattress Social rule Knife Phoebe Buffay's songs Peanut Insulin Handloading The Amazing Race Sugar substitute Scientology beliefs and practices Diseases of the honeybee Raw food diet Gastroparesis Super Size Me Omega-3 fatty acid Ramen Year 2000 problem Neopets Intellectual property Internet fraud Urinary incontinence Little Shop of Horrors Goodness and value theory Ron and Fez ITV Vermicompost Credit card New Coke Inflation Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Eric Bischoff Open access Fasting Internal ballistics Annuity Tooth enamel Equine conformation Health care in the United States Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Potassium bromide Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Taboo food and drink Kashrut Animal rights Draw poker Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Pretty Good Privacy Tuition Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an

question about my diabetic cat my cat is approximately yrs old and a rescue when i took her to the vet the first time i thought she was dying it turns out that after a full physical she was suffering long term effects of diabetes she is now eating special diabetic cat food and i'm giving her insulin injections daily she has been gaining weight and looking a little better but today she has really bad diarrhea and she hasn't urinated at least not in her box or where i can find it i called my vet but he can't see her until thursday he's on vacation does anyone know about cats with diabetes should i be really concerned and try to take her to another vet tomorrow or am i getting alarmed too easily i wouldn't worry if she weren't so ill to begin with does anybody have any experience with this i think it would be a very good idea for you to at least call another vet tomorrow speaking to someone directly will let a vet get a better idea of her condition and they can advise you whether or not you need to bring her in as the first person said if she seems not to be urinating she does need to see a vet it would be less common for a female cat to block usually more of a male problem but it's certainly possible bad diarrhoea is a bit of a concern too she may become dehydrated if she's losing a lot of fluid that way and any sort of infections or inflammation will change her body's energy demands which could upset the control you've got over her diabetes at the moment is she eating you probably already know this but if she's not eating or is eating a lot less than normal you should be careful about giving her her insulin a good idea to reduce the dose usually to about half as she may become hypoglycaemic low blood sugar her blood sugar may also drop because her body is using more energy than normal if she starts looking really flat rub some honey on her gums talk to a vet you're not being too easily alarmed never mess about when you're dealing with a sick animal with diabetes hope she's okay o  Diabetes mellitus Insulin Hypoglycemia Nutrition Diarrhea Guinea pig Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Atkins Nutritional Approach Chlorpromazine Stomach cancer Hyperglycemia Diabetic ketoacidosis Prostate cancer Dieting Domestic rabbit Ferret Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Growth hormone treatment Vitamin C Folic acid Crohn's disease Coeliac disease Gastroparesis Intensive insulinotherapy Pneumonia Stroke Raw food diet Diabetic neuropathy Diabetic coma Breastfeeding Milk Caffeine Low-carbohydrate diet Aspartame Diabetic nephropathy Penis Insulin resistance Sugar substitute Social rule Chronic fatigue syndrome Dialysis Oral contraceptive Terri Schiavo Tooth enamel Diabetes insipidus Garfield Blood sugar Fancy rat First aid Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia Binge eating disorder Gout Obstetrics Growth hormone deficiency Chocolate Cat Obesity Diabetic retinopathy Gastroenteritis Glucocorticoid Polycystic ovary syndrome Glucokinase Protein-energy malnutrition Osteoarthritis Dietary fiber Hamster Bodybuilding Childbirth Psoriasis Urine Cystic fibrosis Housebreaking Pet skunk Medicine Omega-3 fatty acid Blood pressure Alzheimer's disease Theory of conduct Glucose meter Rabies Atherosclerosis Intravenous therapy Equine conformation Diabetic hypoglycemia Clinical depression Death Hypertension Glycemic index Dexamethasone Clozapine Acromegaly Charles Darwin's illness

my cat has a flesh wound please help my cat has been attacked by something and it's too late to take him to a vet he wont stop licking it what can i do it is way to big for peroxide or something i can like see his muscle and s t by the sound of it you need to find an emergency after hours vet it's obviously an open wound is it fresh and bleeding if the wound is deep enough to expose the muscle it needs to be properly investigated and cleaned before anything else and he will probably need some sedation for this to be done it will also need stitching and possibly a drain as well he's probably also in need of pain relief and antibiotics animal bite wounds can be seriously nasty not only is there a high risk of infection but the skin around the wound can die off a few days later because of damage to the blood supply that cannot be seen at the time of the injury if there's no emergency vet that you can get too keep him inside somewhere warm and quiet as he's probably in some degree of shock if he'll let you you can clean the fur around it with warm slightly salty water but don't touch the wound itself let him have water if he wants to drink but it's better not to feed him you're going to have to take him to a vet first thing in the morning if you can't find one tonight and i said earlier he'll probably need to be sedated which can be done much more safely if he hasn't eaten hope that helps and hope that your cat is okay  Wound Hiking Tattoo Childbirth Traumatic brain injury Dialysis Bleeding Cat Shark Chlorpromazine Myocardial infarction Paracetamol Group A streptococcal infection Domestic rabbit Acne Guinea pig Shock Diving Anthrax Pneumonia Hydrogen peroxide Equine conformation Tuberculosis Pet skunk Aortic dissection Avalanche Tooth enamel Fecal incontinence Body piercing Breastfeeding Diazepam Rabies Taboo food and drink Stopping power Naruto jutsu Jackass: The Movie Miscarriage Mouth ulcer Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Intravenous therapy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Menstrual cup Tooth Ferret Diabetes mellitus Prostate cancer Weight training Escherichia coli O157:H7 Social rule Skin Legionellosis Psoriasis Chronic fatigue syndrome Stroke Blood Rocky Mountain spotted fever Drowning Gout Terminal ballistics Leech Needle aspiration biopsy Vampire Coronary heart disease Ebola Marathon (sport) Gastroesophageal reflux disease Narcotic Wound healing phases Cellulitis The Legend of Zelda series enemies Bruise Cancer Coprophagia Pneumothorax Nuclear power Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Trench warfare Atherosclerosis Ulcer Vomiting Lyme disease Electroshock gun Hip fracture Bone marrow transplant Local anesthesia Dracunculiasis Toxoplasmosis

how long do allergy shots take i am allergic to cats but i love them more than any other pet we couldn't have a cat at our house because it affected my mom more than it affected me i am about to move out and get a place on my own i feel the need to get a cat to keep me company and i miss having one so much i plan on getting shots to stop me from being allergic the question is how long do shots take if the allergic reaction isn't that bad around cats would it just be okay to own one while i am getting the shots please let me know i have two cats which i am allergic to about a year after getting the second one i started getting allergy shots my symptoms had gotten so bad that i was getting sick all the time and was starting to have symptoms of asthma i started taking shots about a year ago i only got sick once last winter until about a month ago i would only wheeze if i was running the vacuum but now i don't wheeze at all my kitties are now allowed in my bedroom and the youngest sleeps snuggled up to me almost every night before pollen season came about this past spring i was no longer taking any medication your symptoms will go away gradually but for me it has taken less than a year for the cat allergies to completely disappear in the meantime you can still take allergy meds so i don't think you need to wait i was taking allegra and nasonex ever since i first got the cats now i only take nasonex but it's because i still have symptoms of pollen allergies definitely get the cat and get the shots both are worth it  Allergy Hay fever Asthma Chronic fatigue syndrome Food allergy Eczema Multiple chemical sensitivity Immunoglobulin E Aspergillosis Common cold Hypersensitivity Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Decompression sickness Medicine Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story House dust mite Pitaten Conjunctivitis Coeliac disease Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Charles Darwin's illness Clomipramine Homeopathy Tuberculosis Breastfeeding Antihistamine Friends Urinary incontinence M__ni__re___s disease Sulfasalazine Nasal congestion Wheeze Psoriasis First aid Multiple sclerosis Mast cell Pok__mon Live!

kitten has sack between legs we have a month old kitten she has a sack of sorts between her hind legs is this normal it's where her nipples should be but its the whole area that is sagging not just one nipple is this just cat fat or something else it could possibly be a hernia depending on the size of it but it could also be what's called a fat pad many cats have this small bump of very soft fat that hangs from their stomachs right in front of their hind legs it is often part of the breed or just because she's a bit overweight if you have any doubts at all get a vet to check it out it won't cost you much at all if anything if it's just a normal part of your cat if you know anyone who has cats perhaps have a look at them first to get an idea of what a healthy cat looks feels like it will give you some indication of whether your kitten is abnormal or not as always though if in doubt have a vet check it out  Ferret Breastfeeding Manx (cat) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Obesity Guinea pig Stomach cancer Kitten Fancy rat Menstrual cycle Mattress Strap-on dildo Chocolate Rabbit Egyptian Mau Hamster Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tasmanian Devil Domestic rabbit Prostate cancer Japanese Bobtail (cat) Virginia Opossum Siamese (cat) Puberty Brassiere Abdomen Garfield Feral cat Horse Thermoregulation Milk Cats (musical) Pet skunk Breast Body mass index Tyrannosaurus rex Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Puma Poker jargon Azumanga Daioh Hernia Androgen insensitivity syndrome Cheirogaleidae File Allocation Table Adjustable gastric band Dog American Black Bear Bobcat Internal ballistics Wood Socialization Hypoglycemia Sugar Glider Clouded Leopard Hair Cartridge (firearms) Dressage International Phonetic Alphabet Ham Kangaroo Fecal incontinence Kakapo Gastric bypass surgery Intersex surgery Iris (anatomy) Vampire Cirrhosis Super Size Me European Rabbit Undergarment Cancer Deer Anorexia nervosa House Mouse Soft tissue sarcoma Tabby cat Elephant Felis sapiens Dairy Goofy Chair Epistemology Bonus Stage Chronic fatigue syndrome Platypus Cornish Rex Horse gait Colorectal cancer Turkish Angora Normal distribution Phoebe Buffay's songs Feral Armored Core Gastroparesis Little Britain Diabetes mellitus Sport rowing

is there somewhere that i can go to find out about on types of cats and their behaviour fur type etc is there somewhere that i can go to find out about on types of cats and their behaviour fur type etc i am looking for direction to any website or comments from individuals who are cat lovers i am interested currently in persians himalayans and siamese but i am mostly looking for some guidance i became very interested in finding a gentle loving breed that doesn't constantly want to go outside and isn't too crazy athletic i found that for me the scottish fold is exactly what i was after if you get a fold it's parents must be one straight ear cat one fold ear cat if bred fold to fold the kittens will more than likely end up with polycystic kidney disease or a bone fusion problem a straight ear fold has the same sweet personality as the fold ear type the ears aren't that important unless you're looking to show plus straight eared folds will run at least a few hundred less folds are a bit timid they also like time to themselves a few hours a day they are love muffins and follow you around they are gentle and if you get another cat it should be the same breed or another that you have researched and learned it is gentle my little fold kitten was lonely my big cats wouldn't play with her i got her a persian himmie they love each other one of the best places to find cats is through rescues there are rescues that are breed specific i just got a himmie kitten and let me tell you while she is one of the sweetest cats i've ever had we have had nothing but health problems from day my vet says himmies are like that i would think a persian from a rescue or a good home breeder who is not over breeding you need to check out breeders would be healthier i suspect mine was from a mill a great way to research cats is online you can find personality and 'type' information from cfa cat fancier's assoc and from breeder information gosh i personally wouldn't recommend siamese thier care isn't high maintenance but more often than not thier personality is also they are really too smart for their and your own good there is also a site called petfinder com where you can adopt cats if you went online and looked up 'persian rescue' you could find stuff in your area there is also a magazine called cat fancy that is fairly easy to find wherever magazines are sold they profile a different breed each month people who get a 'designer' cat without researching the personality type can end up with a handfull of cat they just can't handle a good example is the bengal a beautiful animal with striking markings whose personality is about as wild as a housecat comes i mean they're tame and all but they are swing from the chandeliers' kind of cats well if you read all this hope it helped  Cat Dog Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Fancy rat Manx (cat) Guinea pig Labrador Retriever Siamese (cat) Ferret Hamster Great Dane Theory of conduct Poker jargon Monster Rancher monsters Azumanga Daioh Care Bears Social rule Feral cat Humphrey Bogart Maine Coon Dobermann Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Nuclear power Kitten Horse Gray Wolf Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Socialization Crossword Turkish Van Livestock Tasmanian Devil Human sexual behavior Arabian horse German Shepherd Dog Draw poker RuneScape quests Nutrition Diabetes mellitus Show cat Species Platypus Golden Retriever Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Turkish Angora Garfield Angora (cat) Serval Tiger Animal Liberation Front Rabies Breed standard Balinese (cat) Hearing impairment Canary Bengal cat Psoriasis Rabbit Zoophilia Breastfeeding Treecat Perl Pet store Iris (anatomy) Characters of Naruto Equine conformation Recurring South Park characters Mixed-breed dog Aerial (dance move) Tooth enamel Friends Surveillance The Amber Spyglass Girly Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Chronic fatigue syndrome Hypoglycemia Toxoplasmosis Shaggy dog story Keeshond Expert system Beagle Blood (computer game) Selective breeding Domestication Eugenics Kodocha Egyptian Mau Cats (musical)

there are stray cats in my backyard should i feed them will they be my pets if i feed them i try to see if they have collars some will run away some will sniff my hand let me pet them they are so pretty i love them if you feed feral cats they will come back regularly for more it is unlikely that an adult feral cat will ever become a pet they are just too used to being wild what you will accomplish is to make more cats as well fed cats breed more often than those who are poorly nourished  Feral cat Dog Cat Feral Feral cat colony Domestication Island Fox Albatross Pet skunk Taboo food and drink Puma Socialization Domestic rabbit Introduced species Seabird Hamster Wild Cat Island restoration Rock Dove Horse Ferret Bobcat Bat Zoo Fancy rat Hunting Kakapo Hybrid Guinea pig Wraith (Stargate) Boar Kitten Chicken Serval Domestic pig Petplay RuneScape quests Pig Cheetah German Shepherd Dog Panthera hybrid Lady and the Tramp Kim Possible Ralston Purina Company Red Dwarf characters Canary Rabbit Maine Coon Tick Cat food The Pet Sounds Sessions Pet Sematary Falconry Agriculture Feral child Skunk Animal euthanasia Hunter (World of Warcraft) Liger Treecat Invasive species in Australia Monster Rancher monsters Teacher's Pet (Disney) Livestock Dog training Ork (Warhammer 40,000) The Fairly OddParents Microchip implant (animal) Dairy Diseases of the honeybee Dove Burial Pedigree pet food Leopard Mixed-breed dog Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Puppy mill Pep__ Le Pew Pekingese Turkish Van Mountain Gorilla Chinchilla Animal shelter Catscratch Our Gang Pet Sounds Show cat SpongeBob SquarePants Pet The Beach Boys Tigon Gray Wolf Exotic pet Spot (Star Trek) Axolotl Redbone Coonhound House Mouse Cloning Rat

i want a cat but my parents say no but they r willing to negotiate any ideas ummm ok c i had a dog but my parents had to give it back cuz my sis had asthma taht i couldnt argue with then we got cats from egypt my homeland and one of them died naturally u noe got old died but the other one got sick and died and see my parents are like refusing to let go of these past experiences they say that it is too painful to go through again and i swore up and down and on my life that if they let me get a pet i would devote my self entirely to it they thought that sounded pretty good but then when my neighbor offered us a cat they freaked and said no and now that i noe what its like to have a pet my life feels so empty without one animals are my life please give me some answers and it is summer and that means i would have ample time end energy to train and bond w this cat w out a pet i feel empty and lost i know that sounds cheesy but its true please help and my b day is coming up should i ask them for a pet then help help help ok i dont want any other pet i want a cat and financially yes i can take care of this cat so that will not b a problem its just that whole parental responsibility thing that parents are so paranoid about and think that their kids cannot handle an animal and believe me i have had pets in the past and i was able to take care of them i know how hard it can be loosing a pet and having that empty feeling inside that only a pet can fill i understand your parents not wanting that disappointment again but if you really want another animal than it is up to you to call a family meeting and sit down and without drama explain the best way you can on how you feel give the plus side of having a cat there are many give your parents the respect they deserve in the decisions they make but maybe if you show how really grown up you are by the way you present your case to them maybe they'll cave in its worth a try good luck  Domestic rabbit Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pet Sounds Simone Weil Care Bears Meaning of life W.I.T.C.H.

why are cats afraid of balloons idk my cat just sniffed my balloon on the floor and she got spooked its a stupid question but im waiting for a special answer in my many experiences with cats and sams at first they are easily frightened by new and different things than they are used to given time they will eventually just accept the intrusions and perhaps or turdhats rather than simply accepts they will embrace if you found a strange object in your room suppose a tom in a t string laying on your bed with the word 'love' written on the scantily cladding undergarmant then you would probably be a little spooked too before reaching for a guage pump shot gun to blow his head off love always tom  The Human Stain Shaggy dog story Cat The Curse of Fenric Prolog Spooks The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath Metaphysics Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Anti-aircraft warfare Vacuum Roswell UFO incident Characters in the Smurfs Fancy Crane Bad Wolf Dilbert The Subtle Knife Tom Waits Calvin and Hobbes Trailer Park Boys Housebreaking Trench warfare The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Little Britain Felis sapiens Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Socrates Angel The Invisibles Sin City The Strangerhood Vegeta The Time Machine Meaning of life Epistemology The Mysterious Planet Robert A.

cat roams for up hrs before returning home is this normal cat behaviour i recently adopted a rescue cat he's neutered vaccinated de flead and gorgeous he has settled well and is very friendly i have recently started to let him go outside but he only returns after hrs usual he doesn't seem that hungry too after such a long time out is this normal cat behaviour as i have never owned a cat before is it possible he's going elsewhere for his food or filling up on mice i am thinking of keeping him indoors just so we can see him once in a while because he takes so long to come back any advice forgot to mention he is years old i would love to put a webcam on him to see where he goes lol that's not unusual cats like to roam but i think it's more likely that he's finding a comfortable spot and napping for a good part of that time cats will spend a lot of the day sleeping if they can assuming that they are fed and that they're someplace they feel safe enough to nap that is he could be out under a bush somewhere dozing for most of that time try this when i feed canned food to our cats i tap the spoon on the edge of the saucer to get them to associate that sound with being fed if you want your cat to come in earlier try standing at the back door and tapping a saucer with a spoon it sounds funny but ours will come running more often than not  Cat Ferret Garfield Homer Simpson The Amber Spyglass The Dalek Invasion of Earth Shaggy dog story Animal communication Salad Fingers The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Friends Guinea pig Feral cat Dog Housebreaking Siesta Sampling (music) RuneScape quests Invader Zim Dilbert Domestic rabbit Social rule Kakapo Dog training Dean Koontz Futurama (TV series - season 5) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Breastfeeding Seabird Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Kitten Time Out of Mind Halloween W.I.T.C.H.

anyway to stop my cat my cat is very jelous when it comes to other cats he will come and bite you when you pay attention to one of the other kitties or when you brush one of the other cats he'll come and push them out of the way im fine with it but it kinda ticks me off when the other cats dont get much attention and it hurts when he bites you people are nasty i would never hurt my kitty it might help to set aside a few minutes where you tell this cat you are going to focus just on him but after that it is the other cats' turns give him that focussed attention brushing playing petting whatever he wants then move on to the next cat if when he tries to butt in on the other cats' attention you can give him a time out by putting him under an upside down laundry basket for minutes if you see him coming you might snap your fingers and point at him while making a shht sound to tell him to back off use this to make a boundary say feet or so where he cannot come any closer if it is not his turn if you give him a time out make sure the laundry basket is in the middle of the room and you might need to put something heavy on top of it to keep him from escaping this should put the social pressure on him to change his behavior because he will be embarrassed and also it will give him a chance to cool down if he is angry i do this with my two cats when they get to fighting or when they insist on jumping up on the table during our mealtimes after a couple firm no s have been tried the first time it's a minute time out if they keep fighting i increase it by a couple minutes and that usually is plenty when they interrupt meals if they keep it up after the first time out i leave 'em in the basket until we have finished eating but i certainly would not advise leaving a cat in the basket for too long and also it is best to not use a cat carrier for a time out because you don't want them to associate the thing that takes them to the vet with a punishment that will make the trip to the vet even more unpleasant for them whenever he bites you tell him a firm no and push in toward the bite you aren't trying to stick your finger down his throat but to show him you aren't scared like a mouse then shut him out of whatever activity is going on by simply ignoring him for a time yay for social pressure or by using a time out do not under any circumstances let him get away with biting your nose this is a play for social dominance i have dealt with attempts to bite my nose by holding the cat's head and placing my mouth around her nose and mouth not biting down just holding her there for a moment any time he is good and patient while you give attention to another cat be sure to praise him and reward him either with a treat or with some more special attention  Aerial (dance move) Milton H.

overweight cat hello my cat is very overweight it weighs about pounds and it only gets like a half a cup of dry food twice a day once in the morning and once in the afternoon it's been eating like this for about a year and a half now and hasn't lost any weight what should i do my cat is about years old by the way the previous owner of this cat overfed it big time just about every time i'm in the kitchen my cat is begging me for food why does he do this why hasn't he lost any weight oops mistake it only gets a cup of dry food not a half as you've found out you can't get a cat to lose weight eating dry food unless you put them on starvation rations no one is happy but if you feed species appropriate food your cat can eat a reasonable amount and still lose weight species appropriate food for carnivores is meat protein and fat low or no carbs you will find this to varying degrees in good quality canned foods you can go the raw feeding route which really is the best way to go but it does require some research i decided to stick with canned food so that's what i'll suggest the average cat can eat oz per day one can and still lose weight poppy once weighed pounds too this is what i did to get her to lose weight and it worked wonders but remember it takes time cats should only lose about pound per month so don't expect dramatic results  Atkins Nutritional Approach Obesity Milk Dieting Dairy Anorexia nervosa Food Cat Guinea pig Brown Bear Domestic rabbit Raw food diet Vitamin C Hypoglycemia Tyrannosaurus rex Adjustable gastric band Garfield Insulin Vermicompost Salmon Dodo Peanut Chocolate Carnivore Breastfeeding Hamster South Beach diet Veganism Tofu Binge eating disorder Hamburger Low-carbohydrate diet Tasmanian Devil Coeliac disease Food preservation Cheese Ferret Livestock Famine Protein-energy malnutrition Crohn's disease Dog Puberty Taboo food and drink Terri Schiavo Healthy eating Sperm Whale Orca Homer Simpson Fancy rat Blue Whale Pet skunk Herring Albatross Bread Kosher foods Fasting Protein Jewish cuisine Ham Mountain Gorilla Kitten Sewage treatment Domestic goat Ostrich Hot dog Sea Otter 2000 Australian Grand Prix Tocopherol Kashrut Chicken Ramen Little Britain Gastric bypass surgery Whaling Phoebe Buffay's songs Minor Harry Potter Beasts Little Shop of Horrors Tooth Falconry Acorn Weight training Sugar beet American Alligator Gold standard Stomach cancer Apple

how do you introduce two new cats to my cat that we've had for several years it's a long story but we have a cat and now we got two more but when we gently tried to show them to the cat we've had for several years one at a time our older cat and the newer cats hissed and growled every time we don't want to stress out the older years kitty but she needs to learn to get along with the other two who are both sisters right now they are seperated but the older cat freaks out when we show her one of the other two is there a way to make them friends i'm sure they will get along eventually and we aren't forcing them to become friends with the older cat any one know of a solution anuolf i know what you mean about how it's like someone coming into your home and eating your food sleeping in your bed all that lol and chicki thanks for the great information is was hard to pick the best answer and on the good side the two new cats get along extremely well with us because long story but we've actually had them for almost a year but they were outdoor cats long story though lol i'm assuming you have the two sisters living in one section of the house the other cat living in another section of the house the easy way is to swap the cats over they will then get used to each others smells before they actually meet face to face and will reduce the amount of hissing you get however no matter how you go about it hissing will occur it usually only lasts a week and they will sort out who is boss and then once that is done it's back to normal they will soon be friends  Cat Friends The Cure Phoebe Buffay's songs Alger Hiss Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Pok__mon Abilities Kakapo Dominoes Sin City Polish language Gramophone record RuneScape quests Garfield Dog training Mattress The Amber Spyglass Ron and Fez The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Days of our Lives Badly Drawn Kitties 2000 Australian Grand Prix Social rule W.I.T.C.H.

how do u stop cats from going potty in the neighbor's planter box my neighbor is a big gardner and he has a planter box right below his bedroom window my cats use it as a bathroom and he can't sleep at night he claims he has tried everything and something has to be done nothing works we have bought products from the pet shop sprays powders everything we have used things from the kitchen such as chili powder and cayen pepper we have used human hair from the barber shop and even rose thorns which they just push aside to go i have heard that coyote pee works but am not sure where to get it i also think that if we got coyote pee it would defeat the purpose because i am sure it smell as much as cat pee so please help plant some cactus in there  Toilet humour Phoebe Buffay's songs Moe Szyslak Jackass: The Movie Chile pepper Ron and Fez Flea Cat Richard Chase SpongeBob SquarePants Coyote W.I.T.C.H.

quirky cats my cat is very quirky and very funny lately though she has been acting like a dog she jumps up on your leg when you walk in the door and wants you to pet her head she wants her belly scratched and she fetches last week i decided to have fun with my new dog i have recently taught her to shake lol i was just wondering if anyone else's cats have a special talent oh and i've started calling her puppy kitty and she answers me also she not a kitten she's almost i don't have a dog either my oldest cat loves to have his belly scratched by anyone that comes along and he just flops and rolls over my little kitten takes my shirt in her mouth and then starts to knead where ever she is at plus they both love to cuddle into me personally now my parents cat i have to say is a little more quirky she'll only play with rubber bands and only rubber bands she chatters consistently out the windows to the birds and she won't eat unless she get brushed or petted all cats tend to have their quirks but i think that because the personalities of their owners and what their owners need want from the cat is how they act but that is my personal theory  Garfield Cat Ferret Dog Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Manx (cat) Dog training Guinea pig RuneScape quests Socialization Invader Zim Housebreaking Shaggy dog story Pet skunk Trailer Park Boys B3ta Dean Koontz Pet Aerial (dance move) Sinfest Kitten Puma Mutts One Tree Hill (TV series) Pet store Fleetwood Mac Atomic Kitten Game show Badly Drawn Kitties Cats (musical) Azumanga Daioh Richard Chase Doug Feral cat The Fairly OddParents Dilbert Shetland Sheepdog Domestic rabbit Cyndi Lauper Spidey Super Stories German Shepherd Dog "Weird Al" Yankovic Ren and Stimpy The Beach Boys Fancy rat Hello Kitty Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Petplay Catscratch Rabbit Rod Stewart Internet phenomenon Calvin and Hobbes The Beatles bootlegs Cheetah Marc Antony and Pussyfoot Pet Sounds Whose Line Is It Anyway?

something is incredibly wrong with my kitten i have no idea what happened an hour ago my kitten seemed perfectly healthy i went ahead and let the two sleep on their own i took a quick nap for about minutes i went into the kittens room and i find one of them lying on the floor appearingly dead i went to pick it up it couldnt move its body at all it could only meow and it had the most ear defying sad meow i've ever heard there was a big white streak along its belly looked almost like liquid and it had severe diarrhea a couple hours ago i saw it poop and its waste seemed just fine i dont know what to do with him and there are no vets open and there is nowhere for me to take him what should i do hes still alive and im feeding him water through a feeding syringe because he's probably dehydrated i'm just incredibly confused and sad i feel like its my fault this happened to my kitten they were on a perfectly normal diet for that age i had been giving them kitten formula and canned kitten food and water there is only one emegerncy vet thats miles from my house i live in the country and the only vet closest to me is miles and its closed for the night no one is there i am home alone im only and i only have my drivers permit i honestly cant go anywhere and i have no idea what the number is for the emgergency vet i know this may seem cruel but if i have no options i was thinking of killing it and putting it out of its missery i have a in my shed i really dont think i can kill the poor thing but if its my only option i will i cant stand to see this poor thing suffer anymore i have a heating fan and hes bundled up my baby blanket he's keeping warm and drinking water but the diarrhea isnt stopping any time soon i doubt they got in a fight there are no blood marks on the other kitten i only have two these kittens were at first orphans they were dying and abandoned on my doorstep and were severly cold from the rain i can't leave my house i have only began to start driving with my permit and i highly doubt i'd be able to make it on the highway alone i really dont know what to do is it possible that this disease my kitten got is contagious the yellow one is beginning to sneeze the black one hadnt began to sneeze at all and if it did im sure it would've been longer before whatever happened to it i was just about to call my nearest neighbors so they can give me a ride to the emergency vet as i was about to call them the kitten died i did what i could i dont know what happened i am curious though if it is contagious and how it got the disease in a matter of hours thank you for all the help you guys gave me i will defintially remember this for future reference i called my parents and they said they'll be able to take my other kitten to the vet first thing tomorrow i still have to pay for all the shots and everything there goes my new computer processor anyways i'm going to go bury the poor kitten thanks agian for all the help everyone supplied first time i've cried in years oh kay is there any chance that the cat could've eaten something in the room something on the floor or on a table if so here is the number for the aspca animal poison control center and here's the number for the pet poison control hotline if poison definitly isn't the cause then i urge you to call someone for help humane societies have emergency contact numbers in the phone book and they have access to vets or if you have an animal control department in your area then you can call them to ask for help many animal control departments have contacts at the humane society or a vet's office worst case scenerio look up the non emergency number for the police in your town and ask them if your town has any services to help you they may be able to help you contact the animal control the humane society or a local vet call your parents cell phone if you can and ask them what to do call a neighbor and see if they can come over and help or see if they can give you a ride somewhere i took an online pet first aid course and here's the text from our vomiting and diarrhea section it may help you vomiting may be caused by a variety of factors including change in diet overeating poisoning disease parasitic infections car and motion sickness and food allergy although vomiting is not uncommon in dogs and cats it may indicate a serious problem and should not be taken lightly particularly if other symptoms are present other factors to consider include repeated vomiting over a short period of time vomiting accompanied by dizziness or seizures higher than normal body temperature diarrhea along with the vomiting presence of blood in the vomit diarrhea may also be caused by a large number of factors like vomiting it may result from ingestion of something inappropriate or may be caused by parasites or other factors and could indicate a serious problem the presence of blood in the bowel movement warrants the immediate attention of a veterinarian the presence of black charcoal black bowel movements indicates bleeding from the stomach or small intestine and also warrants immediate attention by a veterinarian black bowel movements can occur in dogs or cats receiving nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs such as rimadyl deramaxx metacam and aspirin animals experiencing vomiting and or diarrhea may become dehydrated do not feed your pet until you have consulted your veterinarian never give your pet any medication without the specific advice of a veterinarian chew on this should pets be fed milk people often wonder if pets especially cats need milk the correct answer is no many pets have an intolerance to milk that can actually lead to irritation of the digestive system and diarrhea contact your vet the causes for vomiting and diarrhea vary greatly it is best to contact your vet for guidance if your pet experiences either or both symptoms the presence of blood is especially urgent and requires immediate attention do not give your pet any medication unless your veterinarian has instructed you to do so also in case you decide to transport your cat somewhere here is the text from our section on transporting pets in emergency situations carrying and transporting when you are transporting an injured or ill animal you must be careful not to inflict further pain or injury move slowly and speak in a low calm voice taking care not to frighten the animal create a makeshift stretcher using a board or other hard surface use towels or blankets for comfort take precautions to protect yourself as an injured animal may be afraid and attempt to bite any animal that is vomiting coughing or experiencing breathing problems should not be muzzled small dog gently lift and cradle the animal in your arms with the injured side softly against your body place the animal in a box or carrier to transport to your emergency animal facility medium or large dog place one arm around the neck and the other arm behind the hind legs unless the hind legs are injured place the animal on a solid surface to transport cat use either the small dog technique or hold the cat by the scruff of the neck with one hand while supporting the body with your other hand place the cat in a box or carrier to transport the most critical action you can take is to get an injured or ill animal to an emergency animal facility as quickly as possible perk up your ears key points to remember never muzzle an animal that is vomiting coughing or having difficulty breathing exercise caution when moving the animal to minimize further injury or pain move slowly and speak in a low calm voice taking care not to frighten the animal further make the animal as comfortable as possible using blankets towels clothing or other materials use a hard surface such as a piece of plywood as a stretcher secure the animal to the surface with rope or tape secure the makeshift stretcher in a truck or preferably open vehicle for transporting transport the animal to an emergency animal facility for immediate care i'm so sorry you have to face this alone but try to remember that this is in no way your fault and you can only do so much to save the kitten's life a lot of it is out of your hands

why is it that my apt smells like cat pee and i wanna know is it pee or do you think the cat sprayed in the apt cuz it stinks and we wanna know please answer me this question cuz i love my bootsie woo i would not ever wanna give him up for anythingand moms wanting too give him away if he doesnt stop in order to answer your question you either need to catch bootsie in the act or use a black light or your own nose black light is more definitive although most people know what cat pee smells like unfortunately you can get an inexpensive blacklight search for blacklight urine on the internet and see where bootsie has gone then clean up those places with an odor neutralizer like nature's miracle or similar product if you don't clean things up completely bootsie is likely to go again to refresh things in general although not always pee on a vertical surface is scent marking while that on a horizontal surface is a litter box problem once you figure out if he is spraying or having litter box problems you can take steps to modify his behavior by removing the scent removing stress and finding other things for bootsie to do  Cat Skunk Pet skunk Phoebe Buffay's songs Animal communication Toilet humour Jon Secada Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Odor Sexual orientation Olfaction Ultraviolet Crossword Tobacco smoking The Marshall Mathers LP House Mouse Dog Urine Menstrual cycle Halitosis Diseases of the honeybee Happy Tree Friends Ron and Fez Philosophy of language Guinea pig Felis sapiens Cat litter A Course In Miracles Japanese toilet Spotted Skunk Sinfest Cheetah James Brown (musician) Foot odor Housebreaking Polarization Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Sage National Kidney Foundation Singapore Bart chalkboard gags Theodicy The nature of God in Western theology Shaggy dog story Ren and Stimpy Heinkel He 100 Cosmo Kramer Skateboarding trick Alignment (role-playing games) Camp Lazlo Red Fox Polish language International Phonetic Alphabet Whose Line Is It Anyway?

anyone out there have experience with pets who've gotten the big c from second hand smoke my kitten is months old he is so sweet one of my roommates smokes and i've told them i wish they wouldn't do it around my kitten however last week my worst fears came to life my kitten had a hacking episode so i took him to the vet they did some tests and an examination in the end they prescribed an antibiotic and said if that doesn't improve his breathing then they'll have to do an x ray they said they suspect cancer but they want to try this med before they do the x ray i got a second opinion and they agreed i know the best thing i can do is to put some air purifiers around the house keep smoke free areas for the cat to hang out in and groom him more often so if he gets any residue in his fur he won't ingest it during grooming i've worked with animals my whole life and i've faced death and disease many times i'm even applying to college to become a vet tech yet i'm scared i love this cat i just need some emotional support does anyone else have a similar story ty we're not sure if he has cancer yet that's why he's on the antibiotics both vets agreed that we should try the medication before putting him through the stress of an x ray according to the first vet the blood tests were inconclusive the second vet we saw didn't take more blood they just looked over the results from the first test and agreed i understand that if he has cancer it will be most likely caused by both a genetic disposition and irritation from second hand smoke it is not hard to believe that he might have a genetic disposition to cancer because he does have food allergies anxiety issues and all in all he's been a rather sickly kitten from day one i've had him since he was weeks old i know he was young to be weaned from his mother but there were difficult circumstances i've done all the medical research needed and i understand whats happening and whats possible vs whats probable i'm still scared can someone whose been through something similar help me feel better and we are moving out soon i can't stand the smoke any longer either i think you should move out do you think your feline is the only one at risk you saw it happen to him so it could just as easily happen to you as well unless you stop this situation you could end up just like your poor kitty there  Cat Chronic fatigue syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Tobacco smoking Eczema Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breastfeeding Cancer Guinea pig Hypoglycemia Coeliac disease Lung cancer Garfield Asthma Aspartame Stroke Cannabis (drug) Medicine Stomach cancer Multiple sclerosis Abortion Folic acid Ferret Common cold Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Domestic rabbit Kitten Urinary incontinence Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Colorectal cancer Tuberculosis Diabetes mellitus Pet skunk Hypertension Traumatic brain injury EastEnders Mesothelioma Paracetamol Undergrads Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Androgen insensitivity syndrome Acne Hamster Teen Girl Squad Vitamin C Friends Stuttering Alzheimer's disease Tocopherol Humphrey Bogart Dog training Dog Tooth enamel AIDS reappraisal Crohn's disease Atherosclerosis Fancy rat Growth hormone treatment Kodocha Cardiovascular disease Taboo food and drink Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Schizophrenia Angina Stress (medicine) Diarrhea Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Azumanga Daioh Drowning Ionizing radiation Hypnosis Health issues and the effects of cannabis Medical analysis of circumcision Post-traumatic stress disorder Causality H5N1 Chlorpromazine Anxiety Baldness Nutrition Animal testing Controversies in autism Borderline personality disorder Homeopathy Randomness Menstrual cycle Legionellosis Bipolar disorder Ovarian cancer

diarrhea in cats i have three indoor cats brothers age who share litterboxes approx days ago we noticed fresh diarrhea in the litter i assumed that it may have been due to a switch in their food fancy feast grilled to normal fancy feast so i switched them back to their original food and we didn't see any more diarrhea for a few days yesterday my longhair cat had new diarrhea stuck in the fur on his rear he clearly did not try to clean it off himself i gave him a bath and cleaned up the skid marks he left on the bathroom floor by the box i noticed that his anus seemed a little red and swollen today i found more light colored diarrhea stuck on his bum though not nearly as much clearly i need to bring at least the longhair to the vet i'm only here to ask for some educated guesses as to what this might be since i'm at a loss aside from the diarrhea everyone's acting normally eating fine nobody's dehydrated their skin snaps back when pulled heat stress something else the cats got their full kitten shots but they didn't keep up on the annuals their gums are pink and they aren't sticky they all have very healthy appetites they're playful they aren't particularly dehydrated the longhair is just a little more lethargic than usual but that could also be due to the heat since we don't have ac basically they're all acting normally aside from the runny stools on the occasions while they're indoor cats the longhair got out recently about weeks ago for days so there's a chance he brought some intestinal parasites with him do you think that anything else could cause these symptoms though okay it could be a number of things internal parasites there is also something it could have it isn't a parasite but i don't remember what it's called a cat i had recently had it and had the same symptoms and it could also be flv fiv i suggest taking your cat to the vet immediately  Diarrhea Fecal incontinence Fancy rat Cat Stomach cancer Guinea pig Dehydration Ferret Garfield Pet skunk Kitten Toxoplasmosis Escherichia coli O157:H7 Hamster Manx (cat) Dog Nutrition Dietary fiber Cheetah Phoebe Buffay's songs Hyperthermia Vitamin C Cancer Myxobolus cerebralis Diseases of the honeybee Allergy Protein-energy malnutrition Maine Coon RuneScape quests Prostate cancer Chocolate The X-Files (season 1) Pneumonia Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Happy Tree Friends Labrador Retriever Clinical depression Carnivorous plant Hemorrhoid Common cold Foodborne illness Chicken Ebola Schistosoma mansoni Babe Ruth Breastfeeding Siamese (cat) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cirrhosis Carpal tunnel syndrome Lactose intolerance The Shining (film) Urinary incontinence Milk The Inside Rotavirus House Mouse Conker's Bad Fur Day Malaria Dialysis Ascariasis Japanese tea ceremony Thermoregulation Trichinosis Japanese toilet Gray Wolf Hirschsprung's disease Giant Panda Homer Simpson Tooth Potato Sento Crohn's disease Social rule Raw food diet Menstrual cycle Asthma Coprophagia Taboo food and drink Gastroenteritis Captain Thunderbolt Cuisine of Laos Feline Panleukopenia Comanche Cryptosporidium Insulin Turkish Angora Poker jargon Shaggy dog story Intestinal parasite

any suggestions on why a cat bites draws blood and hangs on to people like a monkey can't afford law suit the cat has been spayed along time ago he is a male tuxedo cat approx years old and is an inside cat i really need help my guess is that he has been doing this since he was a little kitten and no one has trained him differently if it were another cat they have an innate sense of how far to go before harm is done so you need to train him he already has been neutered so that should have calmed him down some he needs to get disapproval for what is is doing punishment is not what you want to do since he has no idea of the damage he is doing you get his attention immediately when it does it usually by a gentle tap on the nose and the word no since this has probably been going on for some time it will take awhile a squirt bottle really isn't of use here since the quarters are too close a squirt bottle is good when he is on the counter etc most cats want to please and hearing the word no and a tap on the nose will often change behavior if he is hanging on someone else you go over and say no and a tap on the nose don't get into a punishment tap it is not his fault  Cat Pet skunk Dog Ferret Socialization Domestic rabbit Dog training Housebreaking Kitten Morality Theory of conduct Feral cat Sharia Characters of Naruto Gender Phoebe Buffay's songs Manx (cat) Philosophy of language Baldrick Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ranma __ characters Tobacco smoking Joke Lie Capital punishment Characters in the Smurfs Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Guinea pig Milton H.

would you put your cat to sleep if it was healthy okay so here is my dilemma we rescued some feral kittens and one of them was really sick i got rid of the fleas and wormed him but he was still skinny and not growing i took him to the vet today and found out he had flv i had to put him to sleep i am very distraught about this as it is and come to find out it's very contagous so my two eldest cats have already been exposed although vaccinated but we are keeping of his sisters who have also been exposed so in your opinion if the sisters test positive for flv but are normal and healthy would you still opt to put them to sleep it's not about exposure anymore i've read that the of cats develop an immunity to it and still lead normal lives and some may never have any complications with the disease would you wait until there were any complications before putting it to sleep so it could at least have somewhat of a normal life or would you do it as soon as the positive test occured btw the sisters are very active eating well growing and healthy i think many vets would recommend putting a cat to sleep as soon as it tests positive for felv but to be honest i would have trouble doing that if the sister kittens test positive for felv which is not a sure thing some kittens in a litter born to an infected mother will somehow fail to develop the disease they will have a short life most cats born infected with felv die before they are two years old i would have the kittens tested and retested a couple of months later if they are negative the first time if they are positive i would keep them till their health began its inevitable decline and they were no longer enjoying their life and then i would have them euthanized i don't think a complete isolation of cats who test positive for felv is necessary but i would keep them away from your other cats while they go through the phase of biting and attacking that all kittens go through they will have each other for company twenty years or so ago i had at different times kittens who were born with felv both died before they were months old i had other cats at the time who had had their felv vaccinations so i did not isolate the kittens none of my other cats ever developed the disease  Cat Rabies Kitten Pneumonia Pet skunk Ferret Socialization Tuberculosis HIV Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Malaria Chronic fatigue syndrome Influenza Cancer Dog Tick Guinea pig AIDS Multiple sclerosis Feral cat Toxoplasmosis Coeliac disease Herpes simplex virus Chagas disease Heartworm Domestic rabbit Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Vaccination HIV vaccine Group A streptococcal infection Human papillomavirus Poliomyelitis Common cold H5N1 Louis Pasteur Mumps Sleeping sickness Psoriasis Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Myxobolus cerebralis Streptococcus pneumoniae Mantoux test Smallpox Allergy Vitamin C Measles Hepatitis B Sickle-cell disease Infantilism Duesberg hypothesis Garfield Autism Ulcerative colitis Insulin Feral Pharmaceutical company Autism epidemic Vaccine controversy Tuberculosis treatment Legionellosis Asthma Sleep Rocky Mountain spotted fever Colorectal cancer Cirrhosis Ebola First aid Hepatitis Marburg virus Nutrition Kakapo Rotavirus Island Fox Tooth enamel Cephalic disorder Avian influenza Schistosomiasis Theory of conduct Breastfeeding Feline leukemia virus Mathematical modelling in epidemiology Friends The Amber Spyglass Narcolepsy Infectious mononucleosis Decompression sickness Stomach cancer

what temperature do cats like their living space to be my house is always really cold cuz i like it that way but i don't know if my hobbes does is there a temp thats to cold oddly enough cats like heat although each cat is different one woman i knew had a hothouse one summer during a heatwave when the temperature was about her cat would go into the hothouse where it was much hotter she wondered if this was safe so i asked my vet the vet said it was fine as long as the cat had a way to get out of the hothouse by itself and that water was available to the cat she said that animals know when they have had enough and will go where they feel most comfortable hobbes can adapt to many temperatures don't worry about it even though you say your house is really cold i assume it's not like the middle of winter during a blizzard also he can always jump onto your lap when he wants to get warm what you might consider doing for hobbes is buying him a nice fleece cat bed this way if he feels too cold he can go snuggle up in his warm bed also their fur acts as an insulator holding in both the heat the cold as needed there is one way to tell if a cat is too cold they will lie down with one arm draped over its nose to keep it warm its nose is not protected from the cold so when i see my cat do that i get her a small blanket i warm blanket available to him on a chair and or a fleece bed should be enough to ensure hobbes has a place to go if he feels too chilly  Thermoregulation Cat Brewery Sauna Temperature Autonomous building Water Greenhouse Ice Air conditioning Comanche Warm-blooded Wool HVAC Dinosaur Mattress Climate of the United Kingdom Chinchilla Sento Heat Mars Exploration Rover Spark plug Passive solar Calvin and Hobbes Milton H.

why'd my friends cat bite me he was sitting on my lap purring and the second i glanced down at him he kind of jumped up and put his paws on my chest and started rubbing his head face against my face it made me uncomfortable but i was like whatever so i started rubbing the cat on its' back and it continued to purr then it suddenly turned its' head really fast and put its' teeth around my hand he didn't clamp down but still i put him on the floor after that he jumped back on the couch five minutes later tried to nuzzle me in the face again but i ignored him so he left the room and got in the window sill that means the kitty wanted more attention don't be afraid soon enough the kitty will get tired and walk away but kittys bite to get and keep your attention well not really bite kinda stick their teeth into your skin or their claws and sometimes they meow really loud just to get your attention so that's all it is never neglect the kitty because you never reallyy know how sensitive they really are some may feel reall neglected rejected til' where they will go into hiding for hours and some will just go to their spot and lay there wont really move  Cat Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story Milton H.

my new sofa is getting attacked by my cat help i gave advice last week to someone with the same problem now my answer to her is not working i tried sticky tape my suggestion i tried misting water at him i don't want to spray anything on my sofa the tape worked just last year on a new loveseat but he is scratching this one my wonderfull new pillows too he has a scratching post and toy's everything he needs it must be the great fabric i have never had a piece of furniture costing this much before what do you think thanks everyone i am trying to find a slipcover to put on the sofa it is a custom made so the size is not regular i'am having a hard time finding one quickly so i temporalily put king size sheets on it covering it completely he started to scratch the bottom but stopped i have had a scratching post next to the last sofa and it is in the same spot next to this sofa that is his space he loves that tall post he sleeps on the base when not on my bed the material on sofa is soft like chenile that may be appealing to him he does dammage overnight thats common for cats i believe it's hard correcting him at that time and i clipped his nails the day before he started the sofa was there days i had a lot of cats but i can not sit on my sofa unless i remove all that tape then replace it i am going to try the nail covers and the spray thanks again soft paws are a start and will help curb the destruction while you retrain him first off try adding more scratching posts both horizontal and vertical so he has more options of where to scratch put a nice tall sisal post next to your couch where he's been scratching generally the sisal post is more appealing to cats than couch fabric is if possible you can confine him to a different room during the times that you're not home to ensure that he's using the post if you see him scratching the sofa immediately relocate him to a scratching post and scratch the post with your own hands in my experience cats usually like to show you up and scratch the post when you're done they just can't help themselves have treats on hand and praise him extensively when he scratches the post taping aluminium foil to the side of the couch may also dissuade him from scratching there there's also training aids that make a startling sound when your cat goes near them which frightens them away they're fairly expensive though  Upholstery Chair Cat Gramophone record Couch M16 (rifle) Seismic retrofit Bed (furniture) Textile manufacturing Laserdisc Strap-on dildo Plastic Floppy disk Ferret Drill bit The Shining (film) Compact disc Thermal power station Brewery Equine conformation Bulk vending Atari 8-bit family Dog training Woodworking Dog Welding Guinea pig Dog agility Volleyball Gas metal arc welding Shaggy dog story CPU design Casting The Time Machine Geodesic dome View camera Planet Waves Aerial (dance move) Carpet Billiards Mars Exploration Rover Rail tracks Bong Cheating in poker Fire fighting Rail transport modelling Fancy rat Housebreaking Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Windows XP Betting (poker) Glossary of climbing terms Heinkel He 112 Dilbert Semiconductor device My Little Pony Gothic rock Remix Bread Public transport Ron and Fez Marching band Whose Line Is It Anyway?

help my cat might dye omg omg my cat is an outside and inside cat and has fleas so i bought this flea spray and decided to spray him outside cause then the fleas will jump off him inside the house so thats why i did it outside well i started spraying him and he didnt like it and ran around the yard but you have to wait min and wipe the spray off before the cat licks himself cause its poison so he jumped over the fence and went somewhere but i know he'll come back he always does but im afraid he will lick himself will it affect him and kill him what should i do it could make him sick try clinking his dishes together or running the can opener or whatever you do when you feed him then wipe him down immediately don't panic he'll sense your anxiety and won't come back just be calm and do the food thing he should come if he doesn't and comes back later sick take him to the vet right away and next time treat him with advantage or front line or some other kind of flea treatment that stuff you buy at wal mart can make cats sick get it from the vet it's the safest best option  Cat Fire fighting RuneScape quests Red Hot Chili Peppers Full Metal Panic?

cat rescuers what would you do we have a stray it took days of feeding before he would let me pet him i have treated him with cestex for tapeworm and advantage for other worms he is now incredibly affectionate finally putting on some weight and is respectful of our other two cats he has eye discharge and a cough so when we took him to the vet's today for a booster they said to wait two weeks to see if the respiratory infection clears before vaccinating if it doesn't he may have herpes virus or calicivirus and is not a good longterm pet he did test negative for felv and fiv though my question is even if he does have one of the viruses would you euthanize or try to give him as much help as you can my other cat's are vaccinated and spayed he still needs a neuter and booster if he improves i am in a financial position to treat him long term i disagree with the vet for the first time ever about euthanization that's all thank you everyone for your kind words the little fellow will be named lucky the calicivirus and herpes virus are not a death sentence for your little rescue the herpes virus will always be in the cat's system it is when the cat is stressed is when it will resurface with symptons of runny eyes sneezing and runny nose this can be treated calicivirus can be prevented with regular vaccines the school of thought now is vaccinate every three years not yearly it sounds as if this little guy has the will to survive and fight if you are in a position to provide the veterinary care and vaccines he's gonna need go for it and give him another chance he'll probably turn out to be your biggest fan  Pet skunk Common cold Herpes simplex virus Domestic rabbit Rabies Pneumonia Antiviral drug Guinea pig Dog Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Influenza Measles Feral cat Tuberculosis Herpes zoster Fancy rat Ferret Computer virus Virus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer Ebola Influenza pandemic AIDS H5N1 Hepatitis B Pertussis Cytomegalovirus Rabbit Smallpox Chronic fatigue syndrome Hepatitis HIV vaccine Avian influenza Garfield Dog training Anthrax Medicine Hepatitis C Allergy HIV test Poliomyelitis Transmission (medicine) Hay fever Marburg virus Urinary incontinence Human papillomavirus Animal shelter Heartworm Feline immunodeficiency virus Socialization Pathogen HIV Feline leukemia virus Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Asthma Red Dwarf characters Childbirth Sterilization (surgical procedure) Lung cancer Vaccine Hamster Castration Infectious mononucleosis Genetically modified food Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Rabbits in Australia Monkeypox Lassa fever Duesberg hypothesis Theory of conduct Diarrhea The Ashlee Simpson Show Rubella Autism Kitten Progress of the SARS outbreak Prostate cancer Multiple sclerosis Medical analysis of circumcision Diseases of the honeybee Extreme Programming Drowning Silver Gonorrhoea Chickenpox Guillain-Barr__ syndrome Streptococcus pneumoniae Colorectal cancer Insulin Spanish flu Louis Pasteur West Nile virus Vaccination Henipavirus Otitis media

will my full grown cat attack my new kitten my cat attacks the dog we dont have another cat and me aswell no one else but me lol but he only does it to play once he calms down around the dog he is very cuddley and even rub's on him i suggest that when introducing your cats you give the new kitten a bath at a friends house if possible as this will neutralize the kitten and helps prevent you cat getting unsettled give your new kitten a seperate room to begin with so he can get used to it give him his own tray and food bowl only let him out of the room when you are ready let the new kitten search the house and explore on his own to begin with while the other cat is in another room to begin the introduction let the kitten smell the other cats blanket or something first introduce them only for a short time to begin with and gradually extend the periods that they are together until you are sure that they are okay it's normal for them to have a bit of a spit at each other it may take a couple of months for them to get along good luck  Kitten Cat Socialization Domestic rabbit Cats (musical) Ferret Feral cat Manx (cat) Fancy rat Feral Garfield Puma Pet skunk The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Housebreaking Jam (TV series) Natural Selection (computer game) Atomic Kitten Japanese tea ceremony Azumanga Daioh Tick Dean Koontz Xiaolin Showdown Skunk Menstrual cycle Sluggy Freelance Sarah Kerrigan Care Bears B3ta Shaggy dog story Sento Trailer Park Boys Hamster Felix the Cat Vegeta The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Dog training The Beatles bootlegs Ron and Fez Internet phenomenon Tooth enamel Toilet humour Vampire Big Brother UK series 5 Ranma __ characters Galaxy Angel Heartworm Spot the Dog Cat on a Hot Tin Roof Rabbit Chuck Jones Guinea pig Breastfeeding Louis Wain Piano Sonata No. 31 (Beethoven) Ron Weasley Tobacco smoking Lion Kakapo Siamese (cat) The Aristocats Nepeta Sonic the Hedgehog Brown Bear Catgirl Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Little Britain Reservoir Dogs Aztec Abu Dhabi Asiatic Golden Cat Tokyo Mew Mew Lisa the Vegetarian Great Teacher Onizuka Garfield and Friends Dog Abd al-Rahman ibn Sakhr Badly Drawn Kitties God Emperor of Dune Age of Mythology Philip J.

house was just repainted inside how do i help my kitty feel at home again she isn't acting out but you can tell that she doesn't feel quite as secure as before is there any way to make the house more like home cats rely very heavily on their sense of smell when they rub up against doorways or furniture they are very subtly marking their territory the decorating has removed both hers and the communal scent of your home which may be making her feel a little insecure or it could simply be that the fresh odours of the paint etc are offensive to her in which case air the house as much as possible and she should settle down when the smell fades if she has a favourite blanket or something else she likes to sleep on you could try wiping that over the paintwork at cat head height you could also try stroking her with a soft cloth and then wiping that over decorated areas as that will help reinstate her scent be patient and offer her lots of reassurance to help boost her confidence good luck  Cat Skunk Comanche Kakapo Odor Animal communication Characters in the Smurfs Little Britain Fancy rat Discworld gods Ginny Weasley Olfaction Pitaten Violin Perfume Tofu Races of Final Fantasy Trademark Flower Coffin Mattress Pep__ Le Pew Kim Possible Felis sapiens Fruits Basket Sento Diablo II: Lord of Destruction The Smoking Room Japanese tea ceremony Poker jargon Door Volleyball Grace Cossington Smith Bong Sulfur Mach kernel Menstrual cycle Animal Crossing Characters of Naruto Floppy disk Mid-levels Transformers: Energon Cheating in Counter-Strike Knife Theory of conduct Dutch Golden Age Hamster Shaggy dog story Strap-on dildo Territory (animal) The Critic Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Battle of Kursk Social rule Rei Ayanami Ferret Flatulence Russian joke Dog Windows XP Buckingham Palace Singlish Naruto jutsu Battle of France Shoe Katana Clothing City of Heroes Durian Housebreaking Chronic fatigue syndrome Jam (TV series) Continuation War Time Out of Mind Angel One (TNG episode) Cosmo Kramer Urinary incontinence Henri Murger Abstraction Table tennis Radiohead Demon W.

why is my cat pooping everywhere and how can i stop it i've had my cat for a year but recently she started pooping all over the house couch my bed kitchen chairs my bedroom floor sometimes right in front of me at first she was still peeing and pooping a bit in her litre box but now not at all i am getting very frustrated of coming home to poop everywhere i don't know what to do and i don't know why she's doing this nothing in her life has changed so far as i know her litre is the same her litre box and location are the same her diet is the same the amount of time i am home spend with her is the same she is the only cat in the house the only thing that has changed is that a couple months ago i started letting her go outside and she's been fighting with the neighbouring cats i live in a basement suite and the room she stays in is small so i feel guilty not letting her go outside i've had her on a leash and usually go outside with her when i can but lately i've let her go on her own more since she's used to it she is spayed and she recently had all of her shots first i would take her to the vet to rule out any medical problem she could be experiencing have you had her spayed if it is a behavioral problem it really could be brought on by the fact that she has been going outside she may now feel the need to mark her territory and unfortunately once they mark a spot it is so hard to get all of the odor out they will tend to go back to the same places no matter how much you clean check out the website the first guy gave you i bet it will have the name of a good cleaner i can't think of it right off the top of my head good luck  Cat Pet skunk Poker jargon Kitchen Guinea pig Dog training The Brady Bunch Domestic rabbit Hamster 2000 Australian Grand Prix Ferret Sailing Milton H.

why are animals like cats kept as pets are they not meant to live like other animals in the wild this is just for school thanks rocher i like your avatar too originally cats were domesticated tamed and brought in as pets because the ancient egyptians discovered that they were the ideal guards for grain grain was and still is a valuable item in the desert climate if the middle east and people suffered from famines so they stored lots of grain in case they had a bad year however mice and rats thought this was a great treat people needed a way to keep them from eating and peeing and pooping in the grains so people could eat the grain cats were perfect as they ate and kept away the rodents but cats are pure carnivores eat only meat and so they weren't interested in eating the grain themselves at all from there they were revered as gods and people felt important keeping them as pets and they have always been kept around by humans as pets since then there are little wild cats in africa that are thought to be what the early untamed cats we now keep as pets must have been like  Cat Ferret Domestication Guinea pig Famine Carnivore Fancy rat Hamster Pet Brown Rat Taboo food and drink Rat Dog Pig House Mouse Feral cat Mouse Domestic rabbit Animal rights Tiger Cheetah Caracal Meat 613 mitzvot The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents Skunk Hunting Livestock Pet skunk Hedgehog Bat Chicken Stone Age Feral Kangaroo Gray Wolf Lycanthropy Kashrut Wild Cat Vegetarianism and religion Ecology Ancient Egypt Bast (goddess) Nile crocodile Island restoration Phantom cat Food Veganism Brown Bear Rabbit Predynastic Egypt Goat Dingo Flea Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Great Famine of 1315-1317 Creatures in Bionicle Neolithic Revolution Leopard Rabies Dream Black Death Kevin and Kell Fauna of Australia Burial Puma Rodent RuneScape quests Yam Vegetarianism Deluge (mythology) Domestic goat Socialization Porcupine House Cuisine of Africa Food storage Maize Lion Serval History of ancient Egypt Garfield Pet store Raw food diet Jade Emperor Agriculture Laotian Rock Rat Kosher foods History of Africa Cannibalism Minor Harry Potter Beasts Pet Sounds Internet phenomenon RuneScape gods Unclean animals Guns, Germs, and Steel Mustelidae Meaning of life

vets kitty drool so everything seems fine with both cats i've got two kittens male and female litter mates five months old last vet visit the girl weighed lbs and the boy lbs in and of itself it is not a concern and both cats check out healthy well adjusted and they are the delight of all the vet techs they are sweet and friendly not easily frightened i'm worried about one teeny tiny thing sometimes my little girl drools i got the new kitten package at my vet so they have had every shot and all the usual tests feline leukemia worms distemper rabies etc like i said they are healthy it's just that the boy is growing so much faster than the girl a few times a week when she hops onto my lap for cuddles there will be a drop or two of drool on the side of her mouth i'm sure it is not water either i guess i watch too much discovery health and animal planet but i am worried about a neurological disorder or something spay and neuter is this monday help update occasionally adult cats will drool while they are being petted massaged or while nuzzling into fabrics this drooling is usually accompanied with the kneading of the cat's paws this paw kneading action is identical to that performed by nursing kittens and it is this behaviour that the cat is reproducing involuntarily in adulthood those adult cats that do drool knead often choose sweaters coats or other clothing reminiscent of their original suckling environments there the nursing kittens kneaded their paws on their mothers to stimulate milk flow from their teats the anticipation and smell of the milk caused the kitten to salivate and drool http www pets ca pettips tips htm talk to your vet sorry to yell but you seem like a very responsible pet owner people don't realize that they can call and ask questions to animal shelters and vet's offices i recommend doing this or especially talking to them before the operation you can also find information about cat drool by googling kitty drool or drooling cats i'm looking into it now  Dog Kitten Guinea pig Garfield Ferret Pet skunk Feral cat Domestic rabbit Breastfeeding Socialization Rabies Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dairy Manx (cat) Hamster Fancy rat Phoebe Buffay's songs Gray Wolf The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Liger Prostate cancer Puma Puberty Kangaroo The Super Milk-chan Show Sin City Domestic goat Autism RuneScape quests Tick Shaggy dog story Platypus Tobacco smoking Chocolate Animal communication Maine Coon Elephant Child sexuality B3ta Menstrual cycle Cancer Ranma __ characters Microchip implant (animal) Infantilism Trailer Park Boys Animal shelter Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Mixed-breed dog Hello Kitty Coffee XML Azumanga Daioh Marc Antony and Pussyfoot Dream Codename: Kids Next Door Little Britain Nerpa First aid Bottlenose Dolphin Toilet humour Mutts Treecat Chronic fatigue syndrome Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Happy Tree Friends Ron and Fez Veganism EastEnders Ren and Stimpy Heartworm Housebreaking El Goonish Shive Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Milk Insomnia Coeliac disease Massage Internet phenomenon Tigon Rabbit Rugrats Growth hormone treatment Catgirl Hip hop rivalries Pet Sematary Urinary incontinence Adult attention-deficit disorder Cheese Chlorpromazine Traumatic brain injury Taboo food and drink Stomach cancer Tooth enamel

are my cats messengers sent from on high to help me in my spiritual walk i think so yes i think that cats can be messengers sent from on high to help us on our spiritual path i'm a believer fourteen years we lived in a farmhouse the barn and land was leased to a local farmer one day my son came to me and told me that the cat in the barn who had just had kittens wanted him to have one of her kittens i asked him how do you know his answer she told me that cat is still with us and yes i believe he was sent to to help him by the way he named him merlin and merlin and my son are very close four years ago i was rushing off to work one morning when a kitten no more that a few months old jumped into my car as i opened the car door i couldn't just leave him so i brought him into the house separated him from merlin who was then years old as i didn't think merlin would take too kindly to this kitten and planned on finding out who he belonged to when i got home after knocking on doors later that day and no one in the neighborhood claimed him i was torn about what to do i thought that introducing this kitten to our family would really stress merlin he was getting old and made it known that he didn't like the kitten and hissed at him every chance he got even though we kept them separated i planned on trying to find a home for the kitten a few days later i came home from work and found my son merlin and the kitten playing and merlin wasn't hissing my son told me that he had a long talk with merlin and the kitten apparently the kitten had chosen me my son told me that the kitten's name was arthur and merlin's apprentice they have been great friends ever since and as for arthur he has been a god goddess send in fact he is sitting on my shoulder as i type this just as merlin senses when something is wrong with my son arthur senses when things are wrong with me i firmly believe these two cats are messengers who were sent to help us and for those sketpics out there who are thinking something is wrong with my son he is a wonderfully intelligent and spiritual person who is currently a senior at the university of wisconsin madison majoring in biological anthropology and zoology  Shaggy dog story EastEnders RuneScape quests One Tree Hill (TV series) StarCraft: Hybrid The Inside The Amber Spyglass Knots Landing Miss Saigon The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Milton H.

i'm thinking about adding another male cat to my house and i need advice i already have one female spayed and one male my male has not been neutered yet and neither has this new kitty the new one is a full grown cat as well my male has not started spraying yet and he's about months old so i don't think that he's going to spray if he hasn't started doing it already my thing is that with all of the hormones i'm not sure how these new kitties will take to each other also i'm wanting to know if anyone thinks that he will start to spray if i bring in another male maybe they will both spray i don't know these boys are brothers but have been separated since weeks any ideas or thoughts would be great thanks so should i get this other kitty or not and if not then why first of all my cats never ever go outside i had already planned to have him fixed but i haven't had the money to do it just yet my female has been fixed since i got her so no worries of kittens around here i know that my male isn't spraying because he's indoor only and i have searched this entire house with a black light to make sure i know that the two males will not remember each other but it would be nice for him to have a friend this other male is the sweetest cat i have ever seen in my life that's why i want to get him i just want to know what the chances are that they will not spray if i get both of them fixed before i move the new one in with unaltered males in the house you can pretty much bet they will both start spraying even if your female is spayed they will not recognize each other as brothers cats don't have that kind of conceptual memory they will simply see another male and instinctively mark their territory if you get them both neutered then you shouldn't have a problem  Cat Kitten Pet skunk Feral cat Ferret Theory of conduct Poker jargon Friends Domestic rabbit Dog Shaggy dog story Housebreaking Socialization The nature of God in Western theology Nine Inch Nails Castration Debugging Milton H.

kitten wont sleep i just got a kitten she would not sleep at night and keeps me up all night some days she passes out if she is tired if not she wants to play help plz having a kitten is like having a new baby you don't sleep because they don't sleep it's a difficult situation that many people who adopt one kitten don't realise they are going to have to deal with really the best idea is to get another kitten they will wear each other out and can be kept in their own space through the night and have each other's company and allow you to get some sleep so i hope that's an option from you plenty of kitten available now otherwise it can be six months or more before she settles down a little and gains some respect for human sleeping schedules  Atomic Kitten Narcolepsy Kitten Social rule Sleep Feral cat Apollo 8 Socialization Ferret EastEnders Siesta Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Phoebe Buffay's songs Treecat Tupac Shakur Gemini 7 The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Softball Polyphasic sleep STS-61 Urinary incontinence Feral The Rutles Tire Daylight saving time Big Brother UK series 5 Cats (musical) Mattress Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friends Cat Theory of conduct Monday Night Football Stanley Cup Pitaten RuneScape quests Dream Sleeping Murder The Night's Dawn Trilogy Public transport Insomnia Goatse.cx OpenBSD Undergarment Carpal tunnel syndrome Sukkot First English Civil War Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Doug Saturday Night Live Knots Landing The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The Children of Men Abu Dhabi Macbeth Cuteness Crew Exploration Vehicle Thermoregulation Breastfeeding Vampire Every time you masturbate___ God kills a kitten Avenue Q Hikikomori RKO Pictures Internet phenomenon El Goonish Shive Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Sleeping sickness Euphemism AFI 100 Years series The Subtle Knife Science fiction film Planet Waves Journey (band) The Contender (television series) Jewish services United Kingdom corporation tax Hernando de Soto (explorer) Infidels Brandenburgers Silly Symphonies Zhuge Liang Edward Gibbon Wakefield Venom (comics) Bon Jovi Sleep deprivation Thor (Marvel Comics) Satchel Paige Ric Flair Irna Phillips Rosa Parks Cliff Richard Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man The Amber Spyglass Kurt Cobain Gregg Alexander The Beatles discography Surveillance The Marriage of Figaro Oasis (band)

cat flea infestation please help we've had cats for a number of years but for some strange reason we have massive problems with fleas and it's driving our youngest one mad he's about years old if that matters we don't use flea collars as we don't believe in them especially as they could get hung by accident or after hearing some horror stories on purpose we've also tried a couple of flea sprays powders but with little success so what other methods are there what do people recommend should we take them to a vet my mother vaguely heard that there should be an injection please help my sympathies my two cats had this problem some years ago they were totally infested and nothing worked until a new product came out called frontline it is widely used now and most vets stock it though not usually pet shops as it is prescription strength it kills the fleas ticks and lice stone dead in hours you just put the drops on at the back of the neck so they can't get to it and it keeps them free for a month i use it on my two every month a three month supply or one month for three cats is around but is well worth the money as it really will totally rid them of it mine haven't had a single flea since and that was over a decade ago you may also need to get some proper flea spray for the house if there has been an infestation the vet can recommend a good one some of them just don't work i seem to remember there was a good one called something like nuvan but i'm not sure you will only need it once as the frontline will prevent re infestation from good luck it drives you mad  Red Hot Chili Peppers Heartworm Fancy rat Guinea pig Diseases of the honeybee Plagues of Egypt Pet skunk Dog Livestock Sarah Kerrigan Cat Domestic rabbit The Marshall Mathers LP Flea Theory of conduct Equine conformation Tick Socialization Shaggy dog story Dog training The Amber Spyglass Hair Poker jargon Dairy Friends Bat Boy Kakapo Bedbug Combine (Half-Life 2) Rod Stewart Glossary of American football Phantasms (TNG episode) Microchip implant (animal) StarCraft Secret Missions Little Britain Blood (computer game) Lethal injection Conker's Bad Fur Day Rabies Donald Rumsfeld Joker (comics) Fire fighting Luck Arguments for and against drug prohibition Methamphetamine Garfield Terran (StarCraft) The Shining (film) Treehouse of Horror VII Richard Chase Hyperinflation Great Depression Keynesian economics Sin City Headcrab Neighbours Typhus MapleStory Blonde on Blonde Mad Money Girly Good Morning, Vietnam Ron and Fez Ceramics Donald Neilson The Suffering (game) Jam (TV series) The Dalek Invasion of Earth Pet Sounds 2000 Australian Grand Prix StarCraft Episode VI Monopoly (game) Tiny Toon Adventures Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Bubonic plague Night (book) The Death Gate Cycle Piccolo Junior Saga Capital accumulation Siege Password Clinical depression Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Gypsy moth Docking Feral cat Medical prescription Butters Stotch DDT One Piece minor characters Suicide methods Chris Amon Paracetamol The Subtle Knife Kalimdor StarCraft: Hybrid Dr. Seuss Controlled Substances Act Space opera in Scientology doctrine

what's easier grown cats or kittens my seven years old daughter adores cats and we are looking to adopt two cats or two kittiens i am concerned about the amount of time required to care for them any tip to make the job easier is also appreciated thank you very much this is just my opinion but i think that grown cats will be easier to take care of although they most likely won't live as long as the kittens some cats that are older don't like any attention at all and will just leave you alone but most kittens love to get affection from anyone and everyone any time like i said before though older cats will not need as much play time and affection time as kittens hope i helped lil' princess  Atomic Kitten Kitten Cat Cats (musical) Feral cat Big Brother UK series 5 Pet skunk Pitaten Hamster RuneScape quests Azumanga Daioh Catgirl Badly Drawn Kitties Nepeta Softball Siamese (cat) Ferret Fancy rat Treecat Puss in Boots Elizabeth Taylor Socialization Guinea pig OpenBSD Purr Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Every time you masturbate___ God kills a kitten John Forsythe Tokyo Mew Mew Phoebe Buffay's songs Lynx Bengal cat Puma Trailer Park Boys Doug Turkish Angora Diesel Sweeties Care Bears Prostate cancer Ragdoll Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Theory of conduct Garfield Richard Feynman Shaggy dog story Angora (cat) Usher (entertainer) Internet phenomenon Lazarus Long Feral cat colony Marc Antony and Pussyfoot Princess Sally Acorn Wood Dean Koontz Pet store Manx (cat) Saga (band) Ja Rule The Aristocats Violin Enzyme Serval Balinese (cat) Morphology (linguistics) Cuteness Koko (gorilla) Snooker Anorexia nervosa Jade Emperor Jon Secada Through the Looking-Glass Garfield and Friends Maka dai dai shogi The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Japanese Bobtail (cat) Cat o' nine tails Supergirl Saint Phil Collins Felix the Cat Internal ballistics Bobcat Girly Elektra (comics) Dog Economic inequality Louis Wain Paragliding Janet Jackson Fruits Basket Pet Sinfest Darkwing Duck Bob Hope Chocolate The Apprentice 2 Kimi Finster Ranma __ characters Lil Hardin Armstrong

are my kittens play fighting or i know this question has been asked several times and i've already looked at those answers so i'm pretty sure they're just playing but i had an additional detail to throw in there i have month old kittens from different litters had the female for about months now and the male for about days recently got him as a playmate for her when classes start again of course there was the usual scared threatened response by the female including arched back hissing growling etc well they're now fighting i'm pretty sure it's play fighting but they do it a lot i mean a lot and the female almost always hisses they can eat from the same bowl go to the same litter box and be in the same room together but when they fight it looks violent hissing growling scratching biting is this normal should i worry about them as long as no one is getting really hurt with bloodshed it's normal kittens that age are obsessed with hunting and attacking it's their instinct preparing them to kill their own prey instinct hasn't caught up with the fact that cats are no longer wild animals the kittens being from different litters also have to work out their pecking order who is dominant and there won't be peace till they do additionally they don't yet know when enough is enough and when to stop because they have no adult cats to teach them proper cat behavior so one will get too rough for the other and the other has no way to protest except by screaming and hissing all perfectly normal the uproar should settle down in a month or two as they mature and learn to work things out believe it or not it's easier to have two kittens than just one if you only had one all that killer kitten energy would be directed at you  Cat Kitten Gray Wolf Ferret Puma Dog Domestic rabbit Manx (cat) Pet skunk Feral cat Animal communication Guinea pig Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct Columbine High School massacre Fast bowling Asiatic Golden Cat Lion Shaggy dog story Dog training Spider Azumanga Daioh Hamster Garfield Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Piccolo Junior Saga Kakapo Brown Bear Treecat The Star Wars Holiday Special Sin City Serial killer Unreal YuYu Hakusho Milton H.

my kitten has gel like pee with blood in it has anyone experienced this before i was in the room when he was using the litter box i heard a strange noise kind of like a bubbling sound when he got out of the litter box i noticed it didn't look right i am pretty sure it was pee it was clear gel like with blood in it i have only had my kittens for days now i have week old males i am really conerned i already have a vet appointment for tomorrow morning for the regular shots and check up i gave them a call to let them know what i saw today and want me to try and bring in a sample they both seem to be acting normal they are playing and eating but again i am really concerned they are my babies has anyone else experienced something like this what you describe sounds more like mucoid diarrhea since you could not tell where it was coming from that is what i would assume watch for normal stool and see if it has any blood or mucous involved but the 'bubbling sound' would be it passing colon gas with the mucous take in a sample of the 'discharge' and any stool that you can get your veterinarian will want to check for intestinal parasites as a cause of the colitis also a note while males don't come into heat female cats also never bleed in association with heat you are confusing them with dogs a different species  Pet skunk Cat Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Crohn's disease Kitten Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ferret Toilet humour Ron and Fez Flatulence Ulcerative colitis Schistosomiasis Fecal incontinence Human feces Feces Poker jargon Veterinarian RuneScape quests Prostate cancer Irritable bowel syndrome Manx (cat) The Legend of Zelda series enemies Colorectal cancer Hamster Coeliac disease Escherichia coli O157:H7 Oral sex Ebola Clostridium difficile Ascariasis Urinary incontinence Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Endometrial cancer Dog Explosive material Sampling (music) Carbon dioxide Gastroenteritis Garfield Sento Vitamin C Animal testing Cancer Gonorrhoea Obstetrics Little Britain Randomness Chocolate First aid Time Out of Mind Lactose intolerance Origins of baseball Childbirth Laxative Trichinosis Anal sex Morphology (linguistics) Schistosoma mansoni Milton H.

what do you think i should do with this feral kitten first of all let me tell you the situation where i live not in the us there are no shelters etc and there are many feral cats in the streets these cats are care for by the people who feed them and everything but of course there is no medical care for them and there are many accidents now to the point i found a feral kitten recently whose eye was hanging out it lived in a nice neighbourhood with low traffic with other cats and kittens eating at the tavernas there i took it to the vet who operated the eye and neutered him there is no question of keeping the kitten as i have already and i am not allowed or able to take more in a flat so there are options take the kitten back to his old neighbourhood with his family at the place which he knows supposing he will remember my husband says to do that since i wouldn't have taken it away if it was healthy take it to a friend's garden in another neighbourhood she feeds all the cats who come to her garden however she doesn't keep them in the house if the kitty strays away he will be found in an unknown area all alone which option is better if he stays at my friend's garden though he will have good food and no danger but will he stay there will the other cats accept it the ideal of course would be for you to find someone to adopt this unfortunate kitten and keep it indoors of the two choices i would choose giving the kitten to the friend with a garden hopefully the kitten would stay in the garden where it is fed and be safe it will have to fit in to the group of cats your friend is already feeding but if you return it to the place you found it it will have to re establish itself there too because it has been gone and it will smell different when it returns thank you for going to the trouble and expense of helping a little stray cat  Feral cat Socialization Kitten Feral Pet skunk Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Garfield Ferret Hamster Social rule Mid-levels Manx (cat) Animal euthanasia RuneScape quests Health insurance Terri Schiavo Pitaten Theory of conduct Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Treecat Kodocha Feral cat colony Animal shelter Phoebe Buffay's songs Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Taboo food and drink Stomach cancer Girly Breastfeeding Honeybee Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kakapo Goldfish Spider Air-raid shelter Azumanga Daioh Poker jargon Albatross Through the Looking-Glass Internet phenomenon Domestication Physical attractiveness Flat tax Animal communication Divorce Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Badly Drawn Kitties Stray Cats Organic farming Hello Kitty Happy Tree Friends Little Britain Prostate cancer Transformer Gas metal arc welding Toxoplasmosis Alcoholics Anonymous Jumpstart 3rd Grade Veterinarian Rabbit Chocolate Livestock 2000 Australian Grand Prix Cats (musical) Sam and Fuzzy Friends Japanese tea ceremony Infantilism Big Brother UK series 5 Paintball Anorexia nervosa Microchip implant (animal) Food and Drug Administration Raw food diet Arguments for and against drug prohibition Minor Harry Potter Beasts Hunting Veganism Dairy Tick Rescue group Swimming pool Koi Airport Seabird Trailer Park Boys Ultimate Spider-Man Sailing Brian Griffin Fugu Prisoner's dilemma Discus (fish) Gray Wolf House of M Paradox

how to get my cat used to the harness my cat is starting to get curious about our garden and she really wants to be let out shes not spayed yet so i cant let her go on her own i bought this harness but she just doesn't seem comfortable walking with it she runs away when i try to put it on is there anyway i can get her to get used to it i can't get her spayed yet shes too young and the vet won't do it till next month i'm also not sure if she'll be allowed out on her own yet so i really need the harness try associating it with a treat show it to her and give her a treat after you've done that a few times pick her up and touch her with the harness just press it against her body briefly and give her a treat work up to draping it over her and give her a treat put it on her and buckle it and give her a treat you get the idea cats aren't as food motivated as dogs but if you associate the harness with something she enjoys i think you can get her used to it later of course the something she enjoys will be geting to go outside and explore she'll probably run around like she has a monster on her back the first time you actually get it on her so have the leash attached so you can reel her in from behind the washing machine or whatever or she may collapse into a pathetic heap like one of my cats did the first time i put a harness on him trying to convince me that it was simply too heavy for him persistence and food usually works by the way i wouldn't let her out to roam free even after she is spayed there are too many things that can happen to a cat outdoors exploring on a leash is enough  Dog training Pet skunk Cat Strap-on dildo Ferret Guinea pig Leash RuneScape quests Dog Kitten Kitesurfing Paragliding Shaggy dog story Textile manufacturing Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Socialization Garfield Wheel of Fortune Housebreaking Equine conformation Fancy rat Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Price Is Right Hamster Lawn mower Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Ecco the Dolphin Parachuting Characters in the Smurfs English grammar Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling match types Doctor Octopus Alfred Hitchcock Montreal Screwjob Beer Hall Putsch Ben Johnson (athlete) Punisher Mid-levels The Twelve Labours The Amber Spyglass Satchel Paige Swimming Horse Dog agility Milton H.

weaning a kitten i recently weaned my kitten who is now weeks of age and i was wondering how much water he should be drinking a day since he's getting kitten food he doesn't have many teeth yet so we're still wetting his food down with water also is it okay for young kittens to sometimes throw up since their stomachs are getting used to a different diet make sure there is always water available to your kitten if you're feeding wet kitten food then there is a lot of water in that so he'll consume less actual water but it should always be available if your kitten is eating dry food then he'll need more water as an adult he'll need about fluid ounce of water per pound of body weight and as a kitten probably more it is normal for a kitten to throw up once in awhile as long as it's not constant or excessive if it seems to be a lot or chronic then you'll want to consult your vet instead of wetting down the dry food you might want to consider switching to canned kitten food at least until his permanent teeth appear at approx weeks of age  Breastfeeding Kitten Cat Guinea pig Garfield Protein-energy malnutrition Chocolate Dieting Domestic rabbit Tooth Ferret Elephant Urinary incontinence Hyperglycemia Bee Caffeine Dehydration Hamster Atkins Nutritional Approach Soft drink Coffee Diarrhea Raw food diet Fishing Botulism Ham Fancy rat Tocopherol Coeliac disease English unit Alcoholic beverage American Black Bear Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cheese Hypoglycemia Nutrition Coca-Cola Cooking weights and measures Stomach cancer Omega-3 fatty acid U.S. customary units Coconut crab Folic acid Tooth enamel Fecal incontinence Pepsi-Cola Pet skunk Vitamin C American Alligator Genetically modified food Obesity Lactose intolerance Milk Vitamin D Food Bread Dialysis Diving suit Squirrel Insulin Veganism Dietary fiber Garlic Kinkajou Diabetes mellitus Carbon dioxide Anemia Eating Ramen Homer Simpson Red Squirrel Low-carbohydrate diet Nerpa First aid Adjustable gastric band Shark Treecat Blue Whale Atomic Kitten Red Fox Paget's disease of bone Vomiting Capercaillie Fly fishing Sugar Halitosis Rabbit Cuisine of Brazil Brown Bear Metrication Fasting The Coca-Cola Company Water Sugar substitute Sperm Whale Anorexia nervosa Giraffe Bird migration Frog

first time cat owner help please hi i have never owned a cat until yesterday when my kids talked me into getting them one yes they brought out the tears and all anyway i don't mind her the cat she seems really sweet and doesn't mind the kids at all my concern is that she will start to climb on my tables and counters how do you teach a cat to stay down in the outside world cats do not live only at floor level that's why you see them walking along fences or sitting on top of a wall cats like climbing and sitting up high it makes them feel safe from attack but being the curious creatures that they are it gives them the opportunity to watch everything going on around them the best way to train a cat not to do something you don't want it to is to offer them an acceptable alternative if you can provide your cat with a cat tree or jungle to climb this would be ideal as an alternative perhaps you could allow her to sit on top of a book case or on a shelf cover work tops with tin foil as they dislike the feel of it physical punishment of any kind will only make a cat fear and resent you just like kids cats respond best to positive reinforcement lots of praise affection or food treats when they do something good works much better than punishing them for bad behaviour cats are smart and they will quickly learn to adopt behaviour that brings rewards as kittens i've always taught mine basic words such as no out and down if i caught them doing something i didn't want them to i used the appropriate word and physically moved them aside now i only need to say the relevant word and they behave i know a lot of people like using a squirt bottle but personally i never have for the reasons mentioned in the web article below http www littlebigcat com index php action library act show item squirtbottlespunishmentandcatbehavior as you've mentioned that this is your first cat you might find the web sites below helpful they offer both health and behavioural advice http www sniksnak com cathealth http www messybeast com catarchive htm health enjoy your new cat  Dog training Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fancy rat Milton H.

my cat got lose last night he's an indoor cat he is neutered he's years old with no front claws i think when my father was talking to someone he managed to slip out without my dad seeing him we've checked the house so many times last night and we tried to look outside for him i put some put out on the steps and someone said if you put a peice of clothing you've worn they can smell you and come is he going to come back will he find his way home the food is untouched i've stayed up the whole night checking and checking he's my baby he can't survive outside i can relate to how you're feeling because when i lived with my parents my father left the door slightly open and my indoor declawed by previous owner cat got outside at night i was frantic finally after calling her name and looking all over for over an hour i suddenly saw my cat walking from the next door neighbor's house to our house my cat was so laid back about it like what is all the fuss about then my father made the same mistake again and my cat got out but she stayed close to the house anyway it's a good idea to keep going outside to call his name and to walk around the neighborhood to look for him keep looking for him and call his name loud enough so he can recognize your voice ask the neighbors if they've seen him call all the vets and shelters in your area put up lost posters at your vets and shelters you can place a lost ad in your local paper i know how you must be feeling because even though my cat went missing for about an hour it felt like an eternity it's possible that your cat is exploring or that someone thought he was a stray cat and either took him to a vet shelter or has him in their home for the time being cats have a way of finding their way home they are very smart i pray that your cat turns up on your doorstep very soon  Cat The Shining (film) Pet skunk Rais massacre Housebreaking One Tree Hill (TV series) New York Giants Dog training The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Garfield The Amber Spyglass Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Good Times Social rule Rent (musical) The Dalek Invasion of Earth Japanese tea ceremony Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Avenue Q The Inside Domestic rabbit Kakapo Aerial (dance move) The Empty Child What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

do cats purr involuntarily i've always pondered that i have now decided it is time to learn the real answer it's totally voluntary they can stop and start when they please it's not just because the cat is happy your cat might even purr when he's dying the older a cat gets the more its purr changes newborn kittens purr while they feed when they get older some cats purr when they're happy however really scared cats purr sick cats purr and female cats purr while giving birth some cats even purr when they are close to death scientists believe that stressed cats purr to reassure or comfort themselves kinda like when we sing most scientists think purring is a vibration of the muscles of the larynx and diaphragm others think blood flow to the soft palate at the back of the mouth causes the vibrating noise purring happen when nerves are activated within the voice box apparently cats purr only when they want to did you know that lions leopards tigers and jaguars can't purr but raccoons can hope this helps  Cat Purr Cheetah Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Leopard Jaguar Tribble Vowel Lion Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Carolina Panthers Skull Nepeta Lung Kitten Breastfeeding Sleep Spot the Dog Felidae Dog Autonomic nervous system Place of articulation Guinea pig Obstetrics Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Maine Coon Treecat Onomatopoeia General anaesthesia Drowning Childbirth Panthera hybrid Reptile Pitaten Hiccup Azumanga Daioh Asiatic Golden Cat Massage Crocodilia Kim Possible Liger Flatulence Carpal tunnel syndrome H5N1 Infant Urinary incontinence Skeletal muscle Vomiting Mac OS X Tiger Polish language The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases 2000 Australian Grand Prix Black panther Cephalic disorder Brain Rabies Spasmodic dysphonia Dai shogi Whale song Phoebe Buffay's songs Equine conformation Vishnu sahasranama The Cat in the Hat Shark Snoring Hun-Apu Xiaolin Showdown Taikyoku shogi Microphone Maka dai dai shogi Trumpet Voiceless velar fricative Brown Bear Vibrator Avenue Q Traumatic incident reduction Clouded Leopard Brain-computer interface Initiation (phonetics) Johann Philipp Reis The Star Wars Holiday Special Cloning Prostate cancer Flea Hearing impairment Milton H.

vets cat owners please help i need to know asap until i can get to my vet i noticed last nite my cat sneeze on the odd occasion then i woke up to him having a sneezing attack in the middle of the nite when i got back today he is having several sneezes together again my husband and i have had a bad flu is it possible to pass it to the cat his personality is the same he seems happy is still playing eating etc and i will be taking him to the vet monday morning anyway to make sure but until then i need peace of mind someone told me they can die from the cat flu is this true what do you all think the vet will do thanks alot for all of your answers p s he has no eye discharge thanks for all the answers so far a cat cannot catch a cold or flu from humans just to put your mind at ease it could however be anything from allergies to the beginning of an upper respiratory infection does he have any discharge coming out of his nose or eyes if so what color is it if there is not discharge or it's clear the problem is most likely allergies now a green mucousy discharge can be a sign of an infection unfortunately you can't get a proper diagnosis without the cat being examined if the vet feels it's just allergies they'll send him home on an antihistamine for an upper respiratory infection he may just be sent home on antibiotics if it's not too serious as for a serious upper respiratory infection he may have to be hospitalized since you say he's acting normal and still eating and drinking it's most likely allergies if he does become lethargic or stops eating try to get him to a vet sooner  Common cold Fancy rat Cat Upper respiratory tract infection Allergy Guinea pig Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Asthma Sneeze Hay fever H5N1 Domestic rabbit Tuberculosis Oh My Goddess!

i have just rescued a siamese cat i already have a cta hw would u introduce them i laready had a tabby cat which is now just months old which i have had since a kitten which is male and i have now rescued a older female siamese cat which is yrs old we introduced them for a few mins but she hisses at him but he just doesnt respond will they eveentualy get on and any ideas on introducing them and ideas of what could help them to get along thanx my younger cat just isnt bothered by her and doesnt responds to the hissing he justs carrys on playing oh and yes of course they are neutered lol hi there when introducing a new cat you should always separate them for the first couple of days to allow your current cat to get used to the scent of your new cat what you need to do is set up a room for your new cat perhaps a spare room if you have one if not any other room that is safe and you can close off keep your new cat in the room for the next day and night your boy cat will most likely sniff at the door and be very curious you can of course visit your new cat regularly don't feel cruel putting her in one room at the rescue shelters cats are kept in relatively small pens anyway so as a temporary measure it won't be a problem on the second day put your boy cat in your new cat's room and close the door bring your female cat out so that she can get used to her new surroundings without having to face your boy cat it's not surprising that she hissed at him she felt threatened she's in a brand new environment doesn't know who she can trust and to top if off she's faced with another cat who she of course does not know whether to trust allow your new cat freedom of the house for an hour or so this will also give your existing cat a chance to get used to the new smells of your female cat then put her back in her room and let your male cat have his house back it's very important that for the first few weeks you give extra attention to your male cat and reassure him that he is still loved you do not have to ignore your new cat of course but make sure male kitty gets double the normal amount of attention it is also useful to try to stroke each one of them directly after the other in order to mix their scents you can also switch their bedding over every day to do the same thing as long as there is no hissing through the door from either cat if there is wait a little while longer you can let your new cat out some recommend putting the new cat in a carrier but we found that when we did this with our kitten to introduce to our existing male he hissed continuously when we let her out of the cage there was no hissing at all for the first month or however long it takes never leave the two cats alone when you are out or asleep even if they appear to be getting along better to be safe than sorry some hissing growling and posturing is normal so don't worry it's just a cat's way of asserting his her dominance whilst also showing that they feel threatened if they didn't feel threatened they would not feel the need to show their dominance therefore do not scold or punish either cat for hissing let them work it out on their own the only time you may intervene is if they get into a fight that causes pain squealing blood being drawn etc in which case you should rattle a can of pennies car keys or spray lightly with water don't go in there with your hands it may take a little while for them to adapt seeing as your new cat is older than your current cat generally younger cats or kittens are easier for the existing cat to accept having said that i'm sure your cats will get along eventually i've had my kitten for about weeks now and it took about weeks for my male cat to stop showing his dominance he would pounce on her and bite her neck as soon as he saw her it's not perfect still but they are getting much better these things take time i hope you and both of your cats will be very happy together you may want to read the following articles http www messybeast com first impressions htm http www cat world com au catintroductions htm http www workpad com index item aspx objectid http www veterinarypetcare com catintroduction html xx emmie p s i hope that both are neutered  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Domestic rabbit Social rule Ferret Sin City Dog training The Amber Spyglass Fancy rat Milton H.

what is catnip and why do cats love it so much i am due to get a cat for the first time and someone has said to get it some catnip as they love it but what is it what does it do for the cat anyone help nepeta is a genus of about species of flowering plants in the family lamiaceae the members of this group are known as catnips or catmints due to its famed liking by cats nepeta pleasantly stimulates cats' pheromonic receptor the genus is native to europe asia and africa with the highest species diversity in the mediterranean region east to mainland china it is now common in north america as a weed catnip and catmints are mainly known for the narcotic and hallucinogenic effects they have on cats particularly domestic cats both true catnip and faassen's catnip have a sharp biting taste while the taste of giant catmint is bland approximately two thirds of cats are susceptible to the effects of catnip as the phenomenon is hereditary the fact that it only elicits such a response in a proportion of cats and that it is such a dramatic response suggests that a genetic element is involved that is enriched in domesticated breeds when cats sense the bruised leaves or stems of catnip they will roll over it paw at it chew it lick it leap about and purr often salivating copiously some cats will also growl and meow this reaction only lasts for a few minutes before the cat loses interest it takes up to two hours for the cat to reset and then it can come back to the catnip and have the same response as before young kittens and older cats are less likely to have a reaction to catnip lions and tigers are also sensitive to the effects of catnip  Cat Dog Kitten Ferret Cannabis (drug) Mosquito Cheetah Hybrid Leopard Ant Domestication Maize Felidae Carnivorous plant Aloe Cannabis Flowering plant Allergy Banana Menstrual cycle Oak Chinese language Cocaine LSD Signal transduction Drug addiction Peanut Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants Rice Long-term potentiation Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Sea-lavender Retina Sage Psilocybin Maine Coon Yarrow Prunus Color Hamster Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor Chile pepper Guns, Germs, and Steel Dandelion Evidence of evolution Elephant Lion Southeast Asia Puma Salvia divinorum Race Glucokinase Giant Panda Cranberry Hop (plant) Carnivora Dogwood Addiction Species Cloning Asiatic Golden Cat Tobacco smoking Tobacco Illegal drug trade Psychosis Elm Final Fantasy Legend III Fugu Plant breeding Tiger Sorghum Honeybee Bladderwort Lilium Gypsy moth Purr Ketamine Iris (plant) Manx (cat) Treecat Ivy Primate Palearctic Mickey Mouse Diazepam Elderberry Planetary nebula Felis sapiens Skunk Lycanthropy Domestic rabbit

can cats learn to ride bicycles what an intriguing question i am assuming that you are talking about a small cat size toy bicycle and also that you do not wish to harm your cat i don't really have the answer except that cats are not as intelligent as dogs and are certainly not as biddable because cats don't have the leader of the pack instinct that causes dogs to be somewhat subserviant to humans but i can't really see why you would want to  Dog Cat Team Rocket Dog intelligence Alaskan Malamute Turing test Socialization Kevin and Kell Felis sapiens Fox hunting Border Terrier Calvin and Hobbes Animal communication Dog training Hamster German Shepherd Dog Pekingese Ferret Domestication Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Yorkshire Terrier Tour de France Philosophy of language G-Man (Half-Life) Animal rights Shaggy dog story The Strangerhood Morphology (linguistics) Wolf's Rain Pet skunk Schr__dinger's cat Sid Vicious Bengal cat Regular expression Toy dog God Emperor of Dune Friends The Death Gate Cycle Discordianism The Doctor Dances Feral Pomeranian (dog) Blue's Clues SMTV Live Darby Conley Sabretooth (comics) Inspector Gadget Kangaroo Azumanga Daioh Comparative psychology Leopard Ocean Beach, New York The Smoking Room Brian Griffin Poodle The Real Ghostbusters Human Cheshire cat Care Bears Beast Wars Obedience training Plame affair Richard Feynman English grammar Road Rovers Puma KaBlam!

is it fair to a cat to neuter it before it has fathered mothered one litter from the cat's point of view it seems cruel and i feel guilty about taking my cats to the vet to be fixed would you feel guilty too thank you all for your answers so far i cant help thinking that if i was male i wouldnt want my bits snipped off but i'm probably just imagining that my puddytats have emotions which they dont really have but it must be a natural instinct to reproduce cats aren't humans and they don't think like we do if you take away their reproductive organs they don't have a sex drive and they lose it without knowing it's gone if you're feeling guilty think of the health benefits as they'll have a longer life expectancy males won't roam as much lessening the risk of traffic accidents they'll be less likely to fight and be injured reducing the risk of catching illnesses including serious ones such as feline leukaemia and fiv there'll be less scent marking and spraying and no caterwauling to 'serenade' a queen in heat a female comes into season up to times a year each time lasting about weeks during these times she'll howl loudly and her behaviour will change on top of which she'll have lots of attention of caterwauling toms she'll still look and act like a kitten when she first becomes sexually mature and i've known people who've been caught by surprise when their little kitten became pregnant the younger the cat the more difficult traumatic and problematic the pregnancy and delivery once she's neutered she'll have less chance of catching certain diseases through bites and reproductive activity she'll have reduced risk of some illesses such as mammary cancer note that a queen neutered after it has first come into heat has a times greater risk of having this cancer than a cat neutered before its first one in short cats have sex to satisfy hormone induced instincts not for pleasure like humans they don't miss what they've never had and you'll be giving them a longer life there are no benefits at all in letting your cat have a littering before being neutered the bare fact is that neutered cats have twice the life expectancy of unneutered ones on top of that there are enough unwanted kittens in the world many being destroyed for want of a good home why bring more kittens into the world even if you manage to find good homes for all the litter would it not have been better not to have kittens and let the homes take unwanted cats from shelters we've cats all neutered males and they are all affectionate we've had since they were kittens and we had them neutered their behaviour has changed for the better since the operation and they seem more contented if you're still not sure have a look at these http www oregonvma org petowners spayneuter asp http www vetsmart co uk html factsheets cat asp id http www catsinternational org articles feline care benefits spaying neutering html http www cats org uk catcare key cat care neutering asp http www rspca org uk servlet satellite pagename rspca rspcaredirect pg catspetcare marker articleid  Dog Ferret Guinea pig Pet skunk Domestic rabbit Prostate cancer Castration Pregnancy Human sexual behavior Abortion debate Cancer Oral contraceptive Gender role House Mouse Garfield Child sexuality Sexual abstinence Androgen insensitivity syndrome Hamster Socialization Sex AIDS Tobacco smoking Sexual intercourse Toxoplasmosis Sex education Grammatical gender Manx (cat) Heterosexuality Elephant Sexual orientation Altruism Infantilism Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Species Housebreaking Estrus cycle Milk Abortion in the United States Liger Divorce World Wide Web Puberty Consensual crime Reproduction Childbirth Teenage pregnancy EastEnders Sigmund Freud Cheetah Grief Postpartum depression Nerpa Endometriosis History of intersex surgery Alignment (role-playing games) Happiness Theory of conduct Zoophilia Gender identity Fox hunting Oral sex HIV Clinical depression Sterilization (surgical procedure) Transgender Baldness Herpes simplex virus Medicine Traumatic brain injury Rabbit Turner syndrome Breast Tocopherol Ajax (programming) Motivation Gray Wolf Sadism and masochism Growth hormone treatment Melanie Wilkes Anal sex Medical analysis of circumcision Poker jargon Schizophrenia Female genital cutting Antidepressant

i have six week old kittens why is the mother cat starting to hiss and growl at them the kittens are drinking water and eating food on their own but still want her milk at times the reason this is happening is because the kittens are starting to get teeth and her nipples are getting sore it becomes painful for the mother and she expresses the pain from the kittens through hissing and growling it is also natures way of telling the kittens to stop biting mom or they can eat some where else great question i gave you a star  Cat Kitten Breastfeeding Tooth Guinea pig Garfield Ferret Mouth ulcer Domestic rabbit RuneScape quests StarCraft: Hybrid Chocolate First aid Ron and Fez Taboo food and drink Socialization Purr Asiatic Golden Cat Dog training Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Manx (cat) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dental caries Azumanga Daioh Hamster Hera Shark Stomach cancer Diarrhea Cindy Sheehan Big Brother UK series 5 The Marshall Mathers LP Internet phenomenon Rabbit Kodocha Nipple Elephant Squirrel Marathon (sport) Coeliac disease Felis sapiens Puma Phoebe Buffay's songs Bart Sells His Soul Atomic Kitten Pet skunk Nipple piercing Alger Hiss Tooth enamel Dave Lister Fancy rat Every time you masturbate___ God kills a kitten Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Kashrut Treecat Platypus Hansel und Gretel Dentition Great White Shark Janet Jackson Sluggy Freelance Richard Chase Drink Oral sex Evil reptilian kitten-eater from another planet Teacher's Pet (Disney) Body piercing "Weird Al" Yankovic Rocko's Modern Life Dieting Girly Fecal incontinence Tarantula King Hiss Soy milk Childbirth Breast Hiberno-English Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Sefer Yetzirah Kosher foods Double entendre Lie Breakfast Nestl__ Fiddler on the Roof Goanna Jackass: The Movie Ganesha Joy Division (band) Hathor Vegetarianism Milton H.

how do i stop my cat from doing his business and on my sofa my cat is yrs old and was neutered when he was months old and lately he keeps going back on sofa to do his business not sure why but any advice on how to stop this thx cats are by nature extremely clean animals so when they begin inappropriate toileting they are trying to tell you that something is wrong if your cat hasn't been seen by a vet recently then take him for a check up as there might be an underlying health problem if the vet rules out any illness then the problem is behavioural and could be anything from a litter box not being clean enough for his liking or changes in the home such as new pet furniture or even decorating the web article below explains various causes of this problem and how to solve it http www bluecross org uk web site pawprint allaboutpets spraying and soiling indoors asp cats should never be punished for inappropriate toileting it's pointless and cruel to smack them or rub their noses in it and it will just make a cat fear or resent you the cat won't understand that you are upset because they went to the toilet in the wrong place they will simply think that they are being punished for the act itself  Cat Housebreaking Pet skunk Fancy rat Ferret Hamster Upholstery Feral cat Socialization Economics The Subtle Knife Dog training Kitten Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Psychiatric hospital Web design Toilet paper Dream Tobacco smoking Menstrual cup The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Manx (cat) The Smoking Room World Wide Web Veterinarian Violin Website The Cat in the Hat Toilet KaBlam!

if a cat is desexed will she still mate with male cats i just assumed that they didn't but i was recently talking to someone and they had assumed that they do but just don't get pregnant now we are both confused also if male cats are desexed do they still mate with female cats cats that are fixed do not mate they do not have the hormonal drive to do so after the procedure humans are the only mammals that mate for pleasure if the cat doesn't have the ability to mate they don't desire it they only do it to procreate once that is gone they have no interest they also don't go into heat or emit the same odors males can smell a female who is ready to mate and once she is fixed she won't have that smell so the male won't have any interest in her  House Mouse Kakapo Skunk Estrus cycle Lion Sexual attraction Orgasm Sex Guinea pig Animal communication Vulcan (Star Trek) Spider Elephant Bird Menstrual cycle Sexual dimorphism Kangaroo Red Squirrel Giant Panda Tigon Physical attractiveness Dog Kiwi Polygyny Sexual differentiation Sexual arousal Olfaction Sulfur Semen Sense Sexual reproduction God Emperor of Dune Milk Biology and sexual orientation Nerpa Cat on a Hot Tin Roof Great White Shark Liger Non-human animal sexuality Platypus Parthenogenesis T'Pol Brain Castration Sleep Panthera hybrid Minor Harry Potter Beasts Demon Hermaphrodite Penis Chess strategy and tactics Monogamy Bottlenose Dolphin Sweating Homer Simpson Ovulation Bat Sexual intercourse Pregnancy Species The Amber Spyglass Sexual selection Anglerfish Leatherback Sea Turtle Heteronormativity Friends American lobster Zoophilia Treecat Whale song Artificial selection Woman Breast Gender identity Puma Shark Pep__ Le Pew The Smoking Room Coconut crab Hybrid Transgender Cat o' nine tails Smegma Inheritance (computer science) Feral cat Tobacco smoking Mating system Wolfrider Gray Wolf Love Testosterone Aquatic ape hypothesis Black Cat (comics) Birth control Prolog Testicle Whale Yerba mate Life extension

kittens too skinny need them to gain weight how do i do that i just adopted two kittens and both are very underweight what do i use or feed them to fatten them back up yes they've been to the vet to get their first shots de wormed and de flead just so you all know first off have they been to the vet to get vaccinated and wormed parasites can cause them to lose weight because they will eat the kittens fat stores if the vet says they are healthy then i would get a good quality kitten food and let them eat as much as they want for now you can also add a few tablespoons of canned cat food everyday this will add calories just don't give them too much of it because in kittens it can cause diarrhea if the vet feels they are emaciated he will probably prescribe a special food to feed them that is very high in calories fat and protein don't give them any milk though since it to can cause loose stools and bloating you can also get nutri cal for cats from any major pet store chain just be sure that they get a health check and are wormed and vaccinated please have them fixed as soon as they are healthy  Milk Dieting Kitten Guinea pig Diarrhea Pet skunk Fecal incontinence Obesity Atkins Nutritional Approach Stomach cancer Ferret Dietary fiber Garfield Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Anorexia nervosa Healthy eating Insulin Omega-3 fatty acid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Weight loss Veganism Dairy Calorie Cat Nutrition Egg (food) Low-carbohydrate diet Tocopherol Super Size Me Food Olive oil Tofu Food preservation Cheese Vegetarianism Fat Fasting Junk food Vaccine Adjustable gastric band Hypoglycemia Foodborne illness Food guide pyramid Foie gras Body mass index Rotavirus Phoebe Buffay's songs Schistosomiasis Kashrut Fast food Rabies Animal Protein Lactose intolerance Protein-energy malnutrition Ascariasis Coeliac disease Dog Chicken Colorectal cancer Fugu Aspartame Genetically modified food Calorie restriction Earthworm South Beach diet Allergy Folic acid RuneScape quests Weight training Cirrhosis Escherichia coli O157:H7 Organic food Soft drink Sesame Street 613 mitzvot Internet phenomenon Atomic Kitten Rabbit Trichinosis Chili con carne Binge eating disorder Energy Domestic goat Feral cat Prostate cancer Peanut Raw food diet Hedgehog Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Soy protein In-N-Out Burger

kitten's eyes are puffy and red and her inner eyelid is half closed does anyone have any idea what is wrong i'm giving her polysporin eye drops right now to see if that helps is there anything else i could give her she did have an eye infection when i brought her home and the eye drops cleared it up that was a few weeks ago i was hoping it would help again but i'll definitely take her to the vet tomorrow if it still looks bad thanks for the advice everyone i took her to the vet today and it wasn't an eye infection at all she has a fever so i was given some medicaion to take care of it i would recommend taking her to the vet so that they can take a close look with a scope to make sure she doesn't have an injury to her eyeball or cornea she may have something stuck in her eye the redness and puffiness is probably caused by her pawing at her eyes because they are causing her pain or distress she may have an infection that needs treated with a prescription eye drop or gel made especially for cats you could apply a clean cold compress to her eyes for as long as she will allow without stressing her out too much the cold would help to alleviate the swelling so call your vet asap to get her checked out if this isn't treated properly she could lose her sight  Eye Common cold Guinea pig Conjunctivitis Psoriasis First aid Cat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pet skunk Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Traumatic brain injury Fancy rat Herpes simplex virus Childbirth Garfield Contact lens Chronic fatigue syndrome Urinary incontinence Medical prescription Chalazion Acne Diving Intraocular lens Cancer Poker jargon Asthma AIDS Gonorrhoea Ferret OpenBSD Domestic rabbit Abortion Chlorpromazine Dialysis Snake Malaria Breastfeeding Dog Sickle-cell disease Pneumonia Group A streptococcal infection Sin City Bates Method Diseases of the honeybee Theory of conduct Hay fever Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rosacea Cornea HIV test Extreme Programming Fecal incontinence Diabetic retinopathy Gun safety Rabies Vulcan (Star Trek) Stomach cancer Babe Ruth Infectious mononucleosis Tuberculosis Aloe Social rule Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Wound Cornea transplant Prostate cancer High-heeled shoe Coma Equine conformation Carpal tunnel syndrome Leptospirosis Mouth ulcer Obstetrics Pitaten Professional wrestling holds Al-Razi Tears Randomness Hip fracture 2000 Australian Grand Prix Computer virus Dog training Gout Glaucoma The Marshall Mathers LP Syphilis Diabetes mellitus Escherichia coli O157:H7 Repetitive strain injury Time Out of Mind Acute respiratory distress syndrome Cellulitis Multiple sclerosis The Contender (television series) LASIK Penis Otitis externa

i can't take my cat with me i'm going to my mom very soon for about a month my cat is almost years old i never been away from her for even a day and i've had her since she was a kitten i'm i'm really attached to her so much that when i migrated i took her with me even though it was a very hard task since certain countries has certain regulations about taking pets along very difficult i can't take her with me when i go to see my mom my mom is in my home country do you think my cat will run away or go looking for me when i'm not there my dad plays with her as much as i do my dad goes to work in the morning feed her come back at lunch time feed her in the evening he feeds her too and plays with her often so i hope she will be satisfied with just my dad company but i'm scared that my cat runs away go looking for me i'm also scared that when i get back she might forget me what do u think i'd prefer cat owners to answer my post pls basically make sure your dad keeps your place secured and locked up when he is not there so she doesn't escape it's hard to tell how a cat may react they're very individualist animals so no one cat will act the same as another however cats are also attached to places as well as people unlike dogs who mostly just attach to people so i doubt she'll want to leave a familiar place especially when she's being fed and taken care of she'll likely kind of forget about you in a matter of days but she'll recall you quickly enough when you come back i left my cat behind for months and she needed a couple days and familiar responses interactions from me but she remembered me again  Feral cat Cat Pet skunk Garfield Socialization The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Shaggy dog story Pitaten Social rule Ferret Strap-on dildo The Fairly OddParents Breastfeeding Dog training Grandview, U.S.A.

need kitten advice i have three kittens two are months and a few days ago i got another that is months one of the older kittens is hissing at the younger one and batting at her is there any advice on how to get them to adjust better and get along thanks for any help we've had cats for a couple of years got at separate times and recently adopted another the secret is to introduce the new cat very gradually and by gradually i mean even up to a month there is no hard and fast time frame you need to set up a room for the new cat with its own litter tray food drink bowls and sleeping mat play with and stroke the new kitten then go play with the established ones so that they can smell the new one and vice versa once they are used to the smell they are allowed to see each other once they are used to that they can finally meet each of these stages needs to be done thoroughly and can take days weeks any new cat kitten being introduced into a cat household will result in hissing and aggression this is because the dynamics of the 'pack' have changed and the leader needs to be confirmed usually a younger cat will happily be submissive but the more dominant ones will want to assert their authority regardless and it sounds like this is happening with you you need to leave them to it as it is natural behaviour it's like you starting a new job and trying to work out who is friendly or not who's your boss without anyone telling you etc all you need to do is monitor it to make sure it doesn't get out of hand and the batting doesn't become violent i doubt it will unless the kitten is challenging the authority of the older cat it should settle down on its own as it's rare cats in a multicat household don't get on  Cat Kitten Dog Feral cat Badly Drawn Kitties Ravi Shastri Friends RuneScape quests Big Brother UK series 5 Social rule The Amazing Race Domestic rabbit Kakapo The Smoking Room West Indian cricket team Ferret Pitaten Sin City Laws of cricket Pet skunk Bat Manx (cat) StarCraft: Hybrid Treecat Blonde on Blonde Violin Fast bowling The Shining (film) Garfield Cricket Shaggy dog story Feral EastEnders Fancy rat Joy Division (band) Socialization Purr Gregorian calendar Babe Ruth Table tennis Alex Ferguson Japanese tea ceremony Breastfeeding Batting (cricket) Knots Landing The Ashes Tobacco smoking Janet Jackson Ranma __ characters Plame affair Karl Rove Tasmanian Devil Parliament of the United Kingdom Transactional analysis Bubble Bobble Homer Simpson Kodocha Timpani Ginny Weasley Politics of Russia Traumatic brain injury God Emperor of Dune Softball Gray Wolf National Football League Ocean's Twelve Sound recording Sluggy Freelance Dualism (philosophy of mind) Girly Little Britain Bottlenose Dolphin Mormonism and Judaism Harrow School Tyrannosaurus rex The Wotch Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 OpenBSD Professional wrestling match types Pok__mon Live!

does it hurt when u scruff an adult cat just curious i dont want to hurt my kitty it does if you let them dangle unsupported unlike kittens they're too heavy to hang by the skin of their neck and shoulders but if the cat is on a table or something or you are supporting its weight with your other hand scruffing is not painful and the reflex that makes them go limp and stop struggling can be useful when you are doing something to them that they don't like such as giving them a pill  Spanking Cat Guinea pig Aerial (dance move) Garfield Kitten Professional wrestling holds Diving Atomic Kitten Chair Conker's Bad Fur Day Pain Manx (cat) Domestic rabbit Professional wrestling attacks Puma Inspector Gadget Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Foie gras Casualty lifting Reflexology Scoliosis Equine conformation Swimming Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breastfeeding Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Tai Chi Chuan Horse tack Treecat Cat o' nine tails Hello Kitty Puberty Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Repetitive strain injury Trapping Leopard Decompression sickness Suplex Violin Carpal tunnel syndrome Cheetah Weight training Fancy rat Childbirth Neck Suicide methods Muhammad Ali Massage Doom enemies W.I.T.C.H.

kitten help animal hospital closed what to do until morning today i found an abandoned stray kitten about weeks old i took her to the vet who gave her antibiotics and vitamins to take i've been feeding her regularly her eyes opened tonight and she seemed to be doing well then recently tonight she started breathing very heavily and hasn't stopped i called the spca and the animal hospital we took her to and they're closed so there's no one who can tell me if this is normal or what i can do so can anybody help i'm looking around online but not finding much she doesn't have trouble sleeping but breathes very quickly sometimes when she's awake she breathes through her mouth what can i do until the animal hospital opens in the morning thank you so much my mom found a animal hospital and i called and talked to someone she told me that as long as the kitten wasn't breathing through her mouth and her tongue is still pink she'll be okay i was told she probably has an upper respiratory infection but the antibiotic she's on will help fight that i just have to keep a close eye on her and make sure she's getting enough oxygen if she starts breathing through her mouth and her tongue looks kind of blue we're rushing her to the emergency vet but for now i'm told she's doing well for a stray thanks everybody she may have been sick before you found her and for that reason her mother may have abandoned her many of the kittens found all alone have been abandoned by their mothers because they are sick or defective a mother cat does this instinctively so as to reserve her milk and attention for her healthy kittens and to prevent a sick one from attracting predators to the nest the kitten may have a cleft palate that allows food to enter her respiratory system or she might have an abnormal opening between her esophagus and her trachea with the same result or she may have a heart defect or some other internal defect such as a hiatial hernia an abnormal opening in its diaphragm which allows its intestines to move up into its chest and crowded the lungs that would explain why she developed trouble breathing after you fed her for tonight i wouldn't feed her much more but offer her water from a spoon or eye dropper keep her warm if she has pneumonia from aspirating food a steamy bathroom may help her breathe hopefully she has a cold that can be treated successfully but many of these abandoned kittens are beyond help when kind people find them don't feel guilty or inadequate if she dies despite your efforts if that is the case remember that you tried and that she was warm and safe and cared for because you found her let us know what happens  Cat Breastfeeding Guinea pig Lung Stomach cancer Cystic fibrosis Traumatic brain injury Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Drowning Atrial septal defect Common cold Domestic rabbit Cephalic disorder Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Hamster Premature birth Kitten Legionellosis Sleep apnea Acne Ferret Garfield Prostate cancer Dog Anemia Vomiting Liquid breathing Respiratory system Diarrhea Reptile Pet skunk Hypoglycemia Rabies Kodocha Chicken Diving regulator Gastroesophageal reflux disease Shock Vitamin C Urinary incontinence Escherichia coli O157:H7 Duchenne muscular dystrophy Tetrapod Asthma Decompression sickness Acute respiratory distress syndrome Androgen insensitivity syndrome Scuba set Folic acid Antibiotic Blue Whale Salad Fingers Psoriasis Rebreather Coprophagia Theory of conduct Cocaine Radiation therapy Poliomyelitis Friends Human lung Protein-energy malnutrition Esophageal cancer Emphysema Nutrition Halitosis Myocardial infarction Stroke AIDS Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Childbirth Fugu Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Pneumothorax Cardiopulmonary resuscitation Tocopherol Crocodilia Aspergillosis Lung cancer Botulism Whale Cancer Sin City Turner syndrome Anthrax Spider Anorexia nervosa Kakapo Fecal incontinence

some advice on my new kitten please the week wait is over and i finally got my gorgeous little ball of fluff on sunday she is just adorable and very clever using her kitty litter straight away thanks to everyone for advice on kitty litter a few weeks ago i also asked for some names for her and for those of you who answered i have named her isis pronounced ice ess my little boy calls her icy which i think is very cute to anyway i m so excited i m rambling so i ll get to the question i was concerned about how my little dog would act with a new kitten but my dog is being wonderful with her it s the kitten that is terrified of the dog she is aching her back hissing and scratching my dog when she comes to close and they keep having these staring standoffs the kitten is fine until the dog moves what should i do i know its only day so should i just be supervising and letting them sort it out themselves do you think kitty will get used to the dog and stop her hissing and scratching i m just worried that our dog will lose an eye the way they are going but the dog is so good with her she just wants to say hello but is scared of the kitten and backs off lol anything i should be doing or some advice would be great thanks so much hi all just wanted to say i m about to pick a best answer but it s so hard because you all gave wonderful answers so thank you all so much for your stories and advice a quick update its been a week with isis now and we had some problems and already have an expensive vet bill as isis got sick last week but she is doing much better now thank god as for her and my dog chelsea well they aren t the best of friends yet but isis is way more curious of chelsea now she likes to play with her and she seeks the dog out for some play time this of cause involves isis chasing the dog s tail then rolling over in a ball of fluff as if to say i m so innocent it wasn t me lol chelsea is still being good with the kitten she has learnt to lick and play with the back of the kitten as there are no claws at the back lol and although isis gives the occasional hiss and scratch to warn the dog off its mostly all fun and games oh and the cutest thing is that they fall asleep in my lap together i took the advice some of you gave me and got kitty s claws trimmed when we were at the vet last week and i am glad to say that the food bowls are now side by side just be patient the kitten is very young and probably isn't sure what exactly a dog is the hissing arching of the back and scratching are perfectly normal and a way of trying to demonstrate that although she's small she isn't a pushover the dog being older recognizes isis as another animal since he isn't being aggressive in retaliation he obviously understands that she doesn't really mean any harm and i'm guessing that he backs off more in disappointment than anything else like i said just be patient continue to supervise them you could try setting their food bowls out at the same time on different sides of the room and each day bring them closer together by the time the bowls are side by side i think you will find that the two animals will have figured everything out good luck  Garfield Shaggy dog story Ferret Dog Piccolo Junior Saga Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an B3ta Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pet skunk Sin City Fast bowling Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 RuneScape quests Guinea pig New York Giants Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Avenue Q Kodocha Dog training Poker jargon Winning Streak Haven (TNG episode) Characters of Naruto Hamster Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Kitten Pitaten Little Britain The Catcher in the Rye Coming of Age (TNG episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Milton H.

i have a month old kitten who pees on my bed some times she was born at the foot of my bed that's where her momma felt comfortable i guess she used to go there every day no it's only once in a while after i got a new bed any ideas on how i can stop this honey it sounds like you need to get her fixed she smells your scent it's the strongest on your bed so that's where she pees i only know this because i had a little female kitten years ago that did the same thing she would literally hop up on the bed and pee twice she did this on me as i was under the covers it was really annoying the vet said i needed to get her fixed i did and she stopped doing it it has something to do with marking their territory and smelling your scent or the scent or feeling in her case of her momma getting her fixed will increase her lifespan so i'd recommend just going ahead and doing that before you run out of fabric detergent good luck kitties are the best  Cat Ferret American Black Bear Mattress Kakapo Sin City EastEnders Guinea pig American lobster Fancy rat Poker jargon Angel One (TNG episode) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Stop and Smell the Roses Dog Shit Trademark Kitten Pet skunk Shark Felis sapiens Strap-on dildo Garfield Sampling (music) Ron and Fez Proprioception The Critic Atomic Kitten Social rule Phoebe Buffay's songs Perfume Milton H.

help with sick cat okay i have a cat that is primarily an outside cat he still comes in sometimes well last week when he came inside we noticed he looked a little thinner he ended up doing nothing but laying in practically the same spot for whole days only getting up to use the cat box and to eat he still pretty much just lays and sleeps all day but he's gone back outside voluntarily a few times and goes throughout the house sometimes now too his belly still seems fairly plump and not skinny but if you run your hand along his back you can totally feel all his back bones and everything any idea what would cause anything like this thanks it sounds like he needs to be wormed with his tummy feeling plump but his frame being skinny it's a good sign that he's eating and using the litter box it's not an infection look around his backside and see if you see white pieces around the anus about the size of a grain of rice you may even see them move you can also check the litter box for stool sample and see if you see the same thing there easiest thing to do it to take a stool sample to the vet and they can confirm if he has worms or not and if so will give you meds to eliminate them the tapeworms are from fleas either what he's picked up roaming outdoors or from rats mice birds that he has caught hope this helps  Cat Hamster Fancy rat Pet skunk Guinea pig Animal House Mouse Dog Diarrhea Care Bears Garfield Hedgehog Aerial (dance move) Ferret Kakapo Breastfeeding Coeliac disease 2000 Australian Grand Prix Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Toxoplasmosis Skinny Puppy Poker jargon Equine conformation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Chicken Knife Snake Mattress Spidey Super Stories Chopsticks Obesity Mickey Mouse Sin City Tlingit Who Framed Roger Rabbit Skinny Dip Ron Weasley Colorectal cancer Sleeping sickness Coprophagia Ascariasis Wood One Piece minor characters Red Fox Skunk Urinary incontinence The Secret of NIMH Origins of baseball Felis sapiens Trichinosis Cliff Richard Vampire Opportunity rover Red Squirrel Housebreaking Diphyllobothriasis Taikyoku shogi Brown Rat 1957 World Series Mnemonic Stomach cancer Sampling (music) Tick Kashrut Tai shogi Bat RuneScape quests Tasmanian Devil House music Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prostate cancer DDT Taboo food and drink Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Time Out of Mind Leopard Ren and Stimpy Textile manufacturing Dai dai shogi Domestic rabbit First aid Ocean's Twelve Oral sex Chronic fatigue syndrome Medical prescription The Cat in the Hat Blink-182 Cestoda Creatures in Bionicle Violin Piccolo Junior Saga Maka dai dai shogi Malaria EastEnders Cleveland Browns

my cute sweet kitty my kitty looks like a little tiger or some wild cat like not domestic look to her she is super loving and great but she will not take a collor i put it on her twice and she almost broke her jaw on it it got stuck on he lower jaw and any tighter it would have hurt her so we were going to get her chiped any how what do you think i think that being chiped is about right any one know for sure did you get your kitty spayed usually your vet can do it while she's under anesthesia for that and then you don't have to worry about it but if she already is spayed i'd call your vet and then your local animal shelters and see who offers the best prices for chipping just make sure if you do the animal shelter that someone knows exactly what they're doing chipping is definitely a good idea in fact i can't think of one reason why it could be considered a bad thing but as someone else mentioned if your kitty wanders off and someone else picks her up without a collar that person might keep her still that is a long shot and if your cat won't wear a collar don't force it esp if her jaw almost broke yikes you could try every so often to slip it on her maybe when she's sleeping and calm but if not then at least you have the chipping and hopefully if she does wander off she won't go far and everyone will know she's yours good luck and thanks for being a responsible owner  Cat Dog Ferret Pet skunk Garfield The Fairly OddParents Kitten Microchip implant (animal) Craps Guinea pig Poker jargon Domestic rabbit Fruits Basket Luck Feral cat Dog training Shark Hello Kitty Pitaten Equine conformation Girly Social rule AFI 100 Years series Inspector Gadget Trailer Park Boys Sin City Knots Landing Ranma __ characters New York Giants Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Something Positive Socialization Humphrey Bogart Happy Tree Friends Marc Antony and Pussyfoot Cleveland Browns Power Rangers Manx (cat) Housebreaking Nintendo Animal rights Galaxy Angel Maneki Neko Darkwing Duck Atari 8-bit family Animal euthanasia Eric Cartman Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) Mutts Feral Okashina Okashi Cowboy Bebop Paul Is Dead Twelve Swords of Power New England Patriots Dental brace Great Teacher Onizuka Hearts (game) 1957 World Series Detroit Tigers Animal Badly Drawn Kitties Random Harvest 2000 Australian Grand Prix Little Britain Cheating in poker EastEnders Banana Trigun characters Monster Rancher monsters Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Manual transmission Game show Animism Animal shelter Phoebe Buffay's songs Kodocha Domination & submission (BDSM) Philip J.

whats wrong with my kitten she's about weeks old a stray that we adopted she had been the life of the party acting like a normal cat maybe a little more evil than most i came home from work today and she had gotten sick nothing strange about the mess now its like she's in slow motion she doesn't meow or wanna play she still follows me around and wants to be loved all the time but her zip is gone she eats and drinks and uses the bathroom i can't figure out what is wrong with her she won't clean herself either today is the first day this has happened do cats get sick like humans where she will get better in a few days i dunno but i'm worried she's my baby she's my kismet yep thats her name i sure would appreciate some advice plz first did you have her to the vet yet cats that are stray can harbor illnesses and not show any symptoms until they are really sick she needs to be vaccinated and wormed asap could she have gotten into anything that could be harmful maybe a chemical or a house plant i would recommend getting her into a vet right away take a stool sample with you that is no more than a few hours old they will want to check it under the microscope to see if she has any parasites do not feed her for hours only give her fresh water this will allow her stomach to rest after that time boil a small amount of chicken and rice for her to eat this is bland and easier on them just like humans after you get sick you don't feel up to par and are not very active have you given her any hairball remedy since adopting her since she is not grooming herself she may have a hairball that needs to work itself out rub about a half inch of the stuff on her paw she will instinctively clean it off and get it into her system this will help her pass anything that may be a minor blockage i would recommend brushing her several times a week especially during warmer weather and giving her the hairball remedy twice a week as a future preventative do you have a vet already if yes then call them most vets have an emergency number even if they can't see her tonight they may offer you some additional advice watch her closely until you can get her in if she woud seem to get worse take her in immediately be sure she is drinking water you can do a quick check for dehydration by pinching up the scruff of her neck it should go back into place quickly if it doesn't and kinda stays up she is most likely dehydrated that is a good sign of illness in a cat or dog it is also very dangerous so closely monitor her keep her inside cats are notorious for trying to escape to hide when they are sick collect a fresh stool sample and keep it refridgerated until the vet appointment try to keep her calm and comfortable so she doesn't get stressed out i hope this helps you and her out i commend you for taking in a stray i just hope you will follow through and get her the proper care prevention such as shots a fecal test and simple bloodwork are much less expensive than emergency treatment i would also recommend having her spayed asap since she is already old enogh for the procedure but will need her shots before having it done this will keep her from wanting to escape as much and will also prevent any unneeded litters  Pet skunk Hamster Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Fancy rat Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Diarrhea Ferret Prostate cancer Urinary incontinence Kitten Hyperthermia Cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pneumonia First aid Garfield Dog training Medicine Thermal power station RuneScape quests Common cold Vitamin C Schistosomiasis Colorectal cancer Dairy Sin City Hypoglycemia Kodocha Equine conformation Characters in the Smurfs Hiking Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Malaria Raw food diet Poker jargon H5N1 Diseases of the honeybee Escape from New York Obstetrics Decompression sickness Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Certified Nursing Assistant Chicken Japanese tea ceremony Housebreaking Chronic fatigue syndrome Social rule Nepeta The Ashlee Simpson Show Sleeping sickness Menstrual cup Nutrition Diazepam Vomiting Diabetes mellitus Escherichia coli O157:H7 Pitaten Water Aerial (dance move) EastEnders Time Out of Mind Chocolate Cocaine Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Entamoeba histolytica Richard Chase Stroke Insomnia Taboo food and drink Rabies Tuberculosis Dehydration StarCraft: Uprising Ron Weasley Mattress The Shining (film) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March G-Man (Half-Life) Insulin Childbirth Coeliac disease Textile manufacturing Anxiety

why is my arm swollen around cat scratches puncture wounds my cat attacked my saturday night because something outside our door scared him he scratched me gave me a couple puncture wounds the puncture wounds are swollen tender what is wrong will it go away before you start looking up six syllable words for diseases that could be transmitted realize that cat induced scratches and punctures are not to be dismissed but they are more likely to result in a simple infection although that can be nasty in itself you likely have an infection usually you immediately want to treat the wound with soap and water followed by an antibiotic like neosporin you might want to try and clean the wound area and apply something like neosporin try a warm compress to try and draw out some of the swelling monitor the site and if it expands you will need to seek medical help otherwise if you are healthy your body will fight off the infection and please don't blame your cat he didn't mean it what happened is displaced aggression they saw something and immediately attacked the nearest object i e person and that person was you  Wound First aid Rabies Traumatic brain injury Group A streptococcal infection Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tattoo Chronic fatigue syndrome Common cold Acne Tuberculosis Sexually-transmitted infection Tarantula Cellulitis AIDS Otitis externa Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Abscess Herpes simplex virus Lumbar puncture Eczema Body piercing Multiple sclerosis Pneumonia Snake Carpal tunnel syndrome Guinea pig Cytomegalovirus Dialysis Fancy rat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Aloe Triage Virus Oral sex Escherichia coli O157:H7 Allergy Hip fracture Leukemia Chagas disease HIV test Medical analysis of circumcision Meningitis Gonorrhoea Tire Sickle-cell disease Anthrax Tsetse fly Pharyngitis Conjunctivitis Prostate cancer Diarrhea Domestic rabbit Gout Lyme disease Diabetic nephropathy Intravenous therapy Blood Psoriasis Diabetes mellitus Rocky Mountain spotted fever Nazi human experimentation Toxoplasmosis Infectious mononucleosis Trench warfare Cancer Legionellosis Traditional Chinese medicine Scabies Vomiting Violin Hepatitis C Dracunculiasis Deir Yassin massacre Antibiotic Pelvic inflammatory disease Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Purple Heart Shock Asthma Boil Antiviral drug Fireblight Abortion Transmission (medicine) Acupuncture Medicine Duesberg hypothesis Bleeding Shaggy dog story Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Cat Syphilis Breastfeeding Benign intracranial hypertension Hearing impairment Influenza Dog Diving suit Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway

just a fun question for cat lovers why do cats bring home mice and other little creatures uneaten do you think its 'cause the treats at home taste better than wild kills wait a minute sararoy i have two cats that are kept indoors i am asking a question for fun and not to get some totally random pointers because cats don't always hunt to eat they hunt because it's their nature to hunt also they like to leave gifts for their humans my kitty used to be an office cat we needed a mouser and she was great at it she always left them for the people she liked which i became one of once she got to know me eventually i became the one who took care of her all the time and most of the mice were left for me she left them mostly dead then all dead then headless i asked a friend of mine who'd always had cats and was involved in the humane society what that meant why the progression she said she wasn't sure about the headless but there was a reason for the mostly dead then all dead my kitty was telling me she loved me but i was a moron the first one was mostly dead so i could finish it off and have a lovely meal the second one was all dead so i could have a lovely meal but since i was too stupid to figure out how to finish it off myself i turned girly and called a guy in she would just kill it for me now that she's a house cat and has no more mice to kill she leaves me her favorite toys where i can find them  Cat Garfield Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Poker jargon Pitaten Zagreus (Doctor Who audio) RuneScape quests The Amber Spyglass Shaggy dog story Taboo food and drink Animal rights Invader Zim Ghost The Three Musketeers Recurring South Park characters Trailer Park Boys Random Harvest Tiger Treehouse of Horror V The Invisibles Anna Karenina The Lovely Bones Dog Kevin and Kell The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) EastEnders Jumpstart 3rd Grade South Park Death Note YuYu Hakusho Black Sabbath The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Minstrel show Meaning of life Kindaichi Case Files Girly Elektra (comics) Shannara creatures About a Boy Futurama (TV series - season 2) 613 mitzvot Survivor (novel) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Knots Landing Rose (Doctor Who) Mickey Mouse Sherlock Holmes Social rule Dilbert Chicken Ferret Bob and George Narnia Friends Witch-hunt Death (personification) Baxter Stockman Ren and Stimpy The Cat in the Hat Houston Astros Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Mouse (computing) Dr. Seuss Angel Sanctuary Care Bears Characters of The Sandman One Tree Hill (TV series) Badly Drawn Kitties Shadowcat Time Out of Mind Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Catscratch Livestock History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Neo (The Matrix) Eric Cartman Joke Micronauts Trigun characters Shot of Love The Death Gate Cycle Sea-Monkey Phoebe Buffay's songs Incarnations of Immortality Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Baldrick Sin City John the Baptist Mabinogion Theory of conduct Peter Griffin Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist ReBoot

what should i do i paid a lot of money to have my cat declawed and found a claw tonight before anyone gets upset with me for having him declawed i want to explain he is double pawed and has an unretactable claw often times it would start growing into his paw and caused him a lot of pain he is a very difficult cat for others to handle although he was tranquilized he kept willing himself to come out it he is a very large part siamese alpha male the staff was afraid of him to the extent that i had to come in for most of the handling i had to take him from his cage and hold him while they unbandaged him it was a very tramatic situation for both of us we specifically took him in to remove primarily that claw he had issues with i was snuggleing with him tonight and found that the claw is growing back i am furious not just for the money we spent but for the pain and suffering he has had to endure he is also considered a companion pet and helps with my depression please don't write to tell me to take him to the vet duh i want to know what i should say when i call thank you for being supportive i did not make this decision lightly even clipping caused him so much pain the act of clipping when it was growing back he would limp around it killed me to see him go through that i love him so much now my heart is in my throat thinking about what he will need to go through again the whole reson we got it done in the first place was to eleviate his pain i have always had cats but he and i have a special bond he has a sister who had the same problem with her paws she had the same procedure at the same time she is easier to handle although not much and has no problems since i will call the vet tomorrow but i need to be very sure what i will say before i call thank you everyone for your suggestions this had nothing to do with bad behaviors although he does lol getting rid of him will never be an option for me i pray that he lives another years painlessly wow first of all i'm going to tell you that you did the right thing by declawing him alot of polydactyl cats those with the extra toes have problems with the middle toes they often turn sideways grow at weird angles and rub against the other toes i have a polydactyl and had to have her declawed too as far as what to tell the vet i would call and have them pay for you to take it to another vet when you properly declaw a cat there is no and i mean no way for it to grow back they actually amputate the first joint on the toe they have to do something and if they refuse threaten them with the better buiseness bureau you can call them and have them on these peoples behinds  Cat Ferret Pet skunk Garfield Equine conformation Professional wrestling holds Guinea pig Shaggy dog story Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dog Domestic rabbit Pitaten Procrastination Friends Poker jargon M16 (rifle) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Volleyball RuneScape quests Miss Saigon Goodness and value theory Ranma __ characters Trapping "Weird Al" Yankovic Brown Bear The Inside Callus Knife Veterinarian Rent (musical) Cheetah Great Depression Knots Landing Milton H.

when is it too late to get a cat declawed my cat was two years old this past july we are getting new furniture and he destroyed my old furniture is it too late to get him declawed before the new furniture arrives meaning is he too old don't worry i know his front claws are his only defense but he is a total indoor cat never outside a cat can be taught to not claw furniture in about days provided you do it right and keep up the maintenance first get some kind of scratching post even a little foot high one is perfect next get some cat nail clippers and cut your cat's nails don't use people nail trimmers as this will split the cat's nails and it's really painful to cut the cat's nails grab your cat's foot and push on the back of one of his fingers this causes the claw to stick out cut the nail just below the pink quick make sure you get the cat's thumbs too whenever the cat tries to sharpen his claws grab the cat and tell him no then take the cat to the scratching post and move his paws up and down on the post to simulate the scratching motion praising your cat the whole time be consistent and do this every time your cat claws something you don't want him to never get upset at the cat and be sure to praise him when you move him to the scratching post and especially when he does it on his own he will trust me the maintenance is then up to you you should trim the cat's nails about once a week eventually he'll lose all interest in your furniture and fall in love with his scratching post  Cat Manicure Nail (anatomy) Professional wrestling holds Woodworking Aerial (dance move) Wood carving Pet skunk Ferret Claw Milton H.

why do cats climb trees my cat will just randomly run at the trees and climb it for no reason really why does she doe this cats are predators and very clever i have seen a cat watch and then mimic a squirrel in the way that is climbs a tree i kid you not there are some big cats that also use trees to hunt not only is a tree a great place to stay away from other predators like dogs who rarely figure out what a tree is for rather than marking its territory love dogs brilliant creatures it is a great place to store food to rest top spy prey on the ground and of course to hunt birds and bird eggs which cats actually hate with an animosity that goes far beyond anything i have ever seen i think it is because they prune and clean themselves as much as cats do and they are just as arrogant a bit like the english vs the french both as bloody arrogant as each other  Cat Gray Wolf Leopard Kakapo Ferret Red Squirrel Hamster Dog Acorn Squirrel Capercaillie Garfield Tyrannosaurus rex RuneScape quests American Alligator Bat Charge (heraldry) Animal communication Climbing Kevin and Kell Seabird Puma American Black Bear Brown Bear Cheetah Flea Nile crocodile Gypsy moth Creatures in Bionicle Albatross Minor Harry Potter Beasts Fancy rat Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Biological pest control Hunting Invader Zim Peafowl Apex predator Shark Fox hunting Azumanga Daioh The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius Camp Lazlo Goanna Europe Ostrich Falconry Predation Bird Lion Ranma __ characters Coconut crab Taboo food and drink The Fairly OddParents Kangaroo Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Fauna of Australia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Asiatic Golden Cat Conker's Bad Fur Day Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Orca African Hunting Dog Tiger Animal rights Beetle Gunsmith Cats Mutts Hun-Apu Feral cat Birdwatching Clark's Nutcracker Caracal Pet skunk Discworld gods Treecat Eastern Gray Squirrel Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sinfest Polychrotidae Egg (biology) Oddworld Kosher foods 2 Stupid Dogs Feral Kagu Xenomorph Andalite Scooby-Doo Slayers Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Taikyoku shogi Fictional crossover European Magpie Carnivore Aye-aye Yosemite Valley Teacher's Pet (Disney) Shannara creatures

trying to fix my feral cat i took in a male feral cat months ago when he was just a kitten his name is wyner because when i go outside all the feral cats know it's time to eat he would always whine alot when it's time to eat he walked in my house all the time i need to get him fixed but to pick him up and put him in the carrier forget it he will let you pet him when he wants but generally he will hiss and put up his paws to fight you he is the only one not fixed in my house as i have several cats and theirs usually a fight with him he causes it or my other males do he howls at night i saw an answer on a question here about someone giving their dog dramamine would it be ok to give a pill to my cat so he'll relax enough so i could put him in the carrier or any suggestions i had left the carrier in the living room with the door open i've placed canned food and other stuff in there he will not go in i have cancelled his appts so many times any suggestions all my cats live indoors wanttoknow i had a similiar problem with a feral cat and my vet suggested this confine your cat in a small room such as a small bedroom and bring in your carrier make sure that the carrier is open and ready to take the cat get a towl preferrably a beachtowl and use that to either throw it on top of the cat like a net and then scoop him up and place him into the carrier or using your hands cover him with the towl and then place the cat in the carrier the towl will provide the illusion of cover for the cat so that he may not put up a big fight and it also provides a shield for you from his claws should he decide to fight when my cat was the same way as yours but this system has worked for me everytime you don't need drugs for your cat that could lead to bigger problems and bigger medical bills when all you need is a big cheap towl good luck  Cat Socialization Hamster Shaggy dog story Feral Kakapo Garfield Conker's Bad Fur Day Guinea pig Fancy rat RuneScape quests Dog Housebreaking Feral child Feral cat Sin City Bobcat Customs and etiquette of Japan Cable television The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Brown Bear Gray Wolf Rocko's Modern Life Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Japanese tea ceremony Draw poker Poker jargon Piccolo Junior Saga Tobacco smoking Apollo 8 Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Aerial (dance move) The Smoking Room Richard Chase Sabretooth (comics) Maneki Neko Domestication Teacher's Pet (Disney) Betting (poker) Sento Invader Zim Phoebe Buffay's songs Kitten Little Britain The Fairly OddParents Carolina Panthers Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) American Black Bear English grammar 1957 World Series Island Fox Magical objects in Harry Potter The Time Machine Major League Baseball television contracts Game show 2000 Australian Grand Prix Andr__s Galarraga Eric Bischoff The Brady Bunch The Dalek Invasion of Earth Dean Koontz Kangaroo Second Battle of the Atlantic Dilbert The Ersatz Elevator Ron and Fez Puma Friends AFI 100 Years series Feral cat colony Oasis (band) Ben Johnson (athlete) Ron Weasley American lobster Combine (Half-Life 2) One Piece minor characters Metaphysics SMTV Live Pet Sounds Janet Jackson Bart Sells His Soul Stomach cancer USS Forrestal (CVA-59) USS Yorktown (CV-10) Big Brother (USA TV series) Kill Bill Luck Satchel Paige Taboo food and drink RuneScape Random Events Battle of Midway Cannabis cultivation Singlish Diablo II: Lord of Destruction

does anybody have a cat diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and kidney insufficiency the vet prescribed methymazole for the thyroid and this medication can make the kidney function worse please if you have gone through this experience share your thoughts i'm very nervous about giving this drug to my dear cat the problem is that hyperthyroidism increases the cat's blood pressure and in doing so increases the rate of a process called 'glomerular filtration' basically it actually makes the kidneys better at filtering than they would be if the cat had normal thryoid function the reason that the kidney function can get worse is that by using methimazole and treating the overactive thyroid you're revealing the true state of the kidneys it is true that some cats with kidney insufficiency may go into full blown kidney failure but most vets are very aware of this risk and will start treatment carefully and monitor closely the advantage of this treatment is that it's reversible so in many cases it's possible to find a balance between the thyroid and the kidneys neither is 'perfect' but both are good enough for the cat to remain in pretty good condition maybe talk to your vet again and get him her to talk the whole process through with you it might help to set your mind at rest i know at least one person above has mentioned radioiodine treatment but if your cat has already been diagnosed with kidney insufficiency this is not going to be much of an option once done it can't be reversed and without the influence of the overactive thyroid this is when the kidney function really does get worse actually something else that's just occured to me as i'm writing this when your vet did blood tests for the kidneys and the thyroid did they also check your cat's urine untreated hyperthyroid cats are often a bit dehydrated which increases the same things in the blood that the kidneys do and looking at the concentration of the urine is the only way to reliably tell the difference between dehydration and kidney insufficiency the vet will probably re check kidney function at the same time as they check the thyroid levels anyway so will be able to monitor what is happening i hope that has helped you and that i haven't been too technical i've spent the last years leaning to speak vet and am now having to learn how to translate it back into english if something doesn't make sense please let me know in a comment or drop me an email all the best to your cat o  Hyperthyroidism Diabetes mellitus Urinary incontinence Prostate cancer Kidney Hypertension Traumatic brain injury Hypoglycemia Turner syndrome Thyroid Paracetamol Chronic fatigue syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Insulin Dialysis Cardiac arrhythmia Pneumonia Dehydration Coeliac disease Medicine Schizophrenia Graves-Basedow disease Folic acid Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Growth hormone treatment Vitamin C Diazepam Diabetic nephropathy Bipolar disorder Autoimmune diseases Decompression sickness Obstetrics Glycogen storage disease type I Clomipramine Renal physiology Psoriasis Cephalic disorder Stroke Psychosis Asthma Gout Acute renal failure Multiple sclerosis Nephron Lithium salt Aortic dissection Post-traumatic stress disorder Maprotiline Thyroid cancer Shock Doxepin Amiodarone Urine Prolactinoma Cirrhosis Clinical depression Endocrinology Theory of conduct Kidney stone Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Diabetic ketoacidosis Atrial fibrillation Heartworm Autism Paget's disease of bone Fibromyalgia Psychiatry IgA nephropathy Crohn's disease Epilepsy Tuberculosis Lupus erythematosus Dieting Weight training Stomach cancer Stuttering Myocardial infarction Radiation therapy Scientology beliefs and practices Chernobyl accident Group A streptococcal infection Mesothelioma Anxiety HIV test Leptospirosis Diuretic Malaria Escherichia coli O157:H7 Malignant melanoma Aphasia Addiction Cocaine

car travel with cats i'm planning on moving to the west coast and i'm going to drive from texas between hrs with my two cats i was wondering if it would be better to put them both in a large breed dog carrier or keep them in seperate cat carriers the cat carriers have just enough space for them to stand up lay down turn around but aren't really very big so i feel kind of bad for cramping them but i'm afraid that a dog carrier may be too big they may get tossed around more or something cat carriers will be ok the cats will mostly sleep anyway they won't eat or drink anything i have made it available to them at rest stops and they ignore it i also put shredded newspaper in bottom of cages and could never see any evidence of use they made themselves at home and ate ok at motels except for one i had that liked to hide under the bed  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hamster Domestic rabbit Fancy rat Shaggy dog story Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sonic Adventure Cat Andr__s Galarraga Poker jargon Invader Zim Livestock Richard Chase One Tree Hill (TV series) Professional wrestling match types Equine conformation Cat on a Hot Tin Roof Episodes of Lost (Season 1) 1957 World Series The X-Files (season 1) Sin City Vampire Hansel und Gretel Naval mine Ferret Fiddler on the Roof RuneScape quests Ron Weasley Rest area Steven Wright Pok__mon Live!

do you agree with this around here in all the small towns people just go around shooting cats and kittens becase there are too many or they think they are pest they will also do the same with dogs once in a while but not as often just as a way to get rid of them the things is there is really nothing we can do because there are no humane soceitys or shelters the closest one is miles away and they only have a mile radius and the cops just ignore the complaints we and my freinds have been saveing wild kittens out on a farm just because the lady is going to shoot them for no reason and it happens all the time got other ideas and what do you think about these situations and what the people do call the state police tell them your local cops are ignoring the complaints and you want something done also at the same time write call your local congressman and explain what sort of backwards podunct people live in y our town at some point someone's going to miss and kill a kid or someone's pet this is something that does indeed happen but that doesn't mean that it isn't animal cruelty and if your stupid local cops won't listen go to the state police and explain what is going on and why you want it to stop where are they discharging their firearms is where they are shooting in an illegal place if so your cops need to listen round up as many friends and adults that are sick of this behaviour sign petitions and give it to the police state police and your congressman  Cat Ferret Sin City Socialization Garfield People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Theory of conduct Dog Great Teacher Onizuka Puma Animal rights Feral Feral cat Kitten Kyle Broflovski Pet skunk Dilbert True Crime: Streets of LA Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Taxi Driver Jam (TV series) Ranma __ characters The Holocaust Baldrick Shaggy dog story Ron Weasley Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Trailer Park Boys Papa's Got a Brand New Badge Pet store RuneScape quests Ren and Stimpy Zoophilia Jack Thompson Badly Drawn Kitties Silent Night, Deadly Night Tiger Hunting KRS One Rabbit The Untouchables Police Beltway sniper attacks The Invisibles Blood (computer game) Reservoir Dogs The Marshall Mathers LP Azumanga Daioh Palestinian National Authority Sharon Tate Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Pitaten Taboo food and drink The Price Is Right Dogville Grand Theft Auto III The Inside Rent (musical) Grand Theft Auto (game) Domestic violence Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Kim Possible Cruelty to animals Teacher's Pet (Disney) Terminal ballistics Mumia Abu-Jamal The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Bob and George Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Barry Horne God Emperor of Dune Poker jargon 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Pet George Michael Prisoner's dilemma EastEnders Ed, Edd n Eddy Kodocha Doug Firearm The Flintstones Working dog Organic farming Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Punisher Jean Charles de Menezes The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Concealed carry (USA) Domestic rabbit Pok__mon Live!

does multi purpose home and insect spray by zodiac work probably works as good as any similar product but this is not to be sprayed directly on the cat if that is what you had in mind good for furniture carpet or wherever your cat might spread fleas and other parasites to if the cat has these a good thing to use directly on the cat would be frontline avoid the cheap stuff from the grocery store these don't work to well and some of the chemicals are not the best thing for a cat you can get frontline from any good pet supply store also can get it from the vet there are similar products which are on the market which should do the trick these come in a small plastic tube you cut it open and apply directly to the cat's neck works for a long time pricy but worth it  Hamster Flea Plastic Solar power Fancy rat Chicken Cat Fire fighting Guinea pig Irrigation Department store Oscilloscope Wood Target Corporation Biological pest control Pesticide Beetle Tokusatsu Supermarket Tofu W.

i'm going to strangle my cats if they dont stop someone help ok here is my situation i adopted kittens exactly months ago everything was great no spraying peeing or any problems getting along with my other cats i did the isolation until they were all scratching at the door trying to get in to play with eachother they like their litter i scoop it twice a day sometimes more no food switches yet all of a sudden about weeks ago they started peeing and spraying all over the house now i've heard dont punish or upset your cat this is what causes this but nothing has seemed to upset them they should be the freakin happiest cats ever they are so spoiled of our furniture is cat furniture they get toys treats they have a whole garage and private potty area to themselves they roam the whole house as they please what is going on today for the first time i also found poo on the floor when the litter boxes were clean its not a matter of the litter boxes as i have one for each cat they are always clean help they also decided to use our bed as a pee litter box days ago ruining our blankets and matress topper that cannot be cleaned or dry cleaned why are they doing this i have tried spraying natures miracle using feliway and other products that supposedly work but they dont ok my indoor outdoor cat that is usually well behaved just now came in and went strait over to the wall and sprayed she is a female and fixed what the heck is going on thanks for all the responses but keep in mind that i have a lot of experiences with cats my whole years of life and have done fostering through shelters this is the first time i've had kittens and my well behaved adults acting in the same way my kittens aren't neutered spayed yet but will be soon the vets want me to wait as they are only months but i think its time all of my other cats are fixed no litter changes in fact when i tried changing the litter they had problems they are still using the litter box but seem to be enjoying just going in the house right now i have the kittens isolated but i dont know what to do about the adult cat that did this right in front of me any ideas i'm wondering if this is a dominance fight which is why there are so many markings i have never seen this before even when i had more than cats in my house at once while fostering get them neutered your vet is wrong the procedure can be done at eight weeks of age as long as the kitten is at least two pounds in weight if this vet doesn't do early spay neuter go to one that does your local animal shelter or humane society should be able to refer you to one or you may even be able to get it done there sounds to me like they're reached sexual maturity and this is the cause of their spraying  Dog Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Kitten Guinea pig Ferret Feral cat Socialization Housebreaking Hamster Manx (cat) Fancy rat Toilet humour Ron and Fez RuneScape quests Japanese tea ceremony Garfield Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Atomic Kitten Dog training Flea Treecat Pitaten Social rule Infantilism Animal shelter The Fairly OddParents Tick Genericized trademark The Contender (television series) Human Castration Liger Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong House Mouse Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Salad Fingers The Star Wars Holiday Special Diseases of the honeybee Fire fighting David Hume Spanking 2000 Australian Grand Prix Toilet Fiddler on the Roof Grammatical gender Milton H.

question about cats i've never owned a cat so don't know too much about them but theres one that keeps coming into my garden i've been out to stroke it gave it some milk its been coming in my house the past few days scratches at the cupboard meows as though its hungry but the fact its not my cat i can't feed it can i just wondering what to do it only comes in the garden about every night so i'm pretty sure someone must own it as i don't see it in the day what i was wondering was will cats just eat eat like a dog or would they only meow for food if they were hungry obviously if its being looked after fed properly i could stop worrying about it just the fact that it was scratching at the cupboard as though it was hungry it also ate some grass in the garden right so basically what i'm trying to say is would a cat still 'ask' for food even if it had a full belly lol well let's put it this way cats can be gluttons when they want to be they are non stop eating machines and have to be shut off once in a while even tho this kitty is most likely being taken care of by someone else he's going to put the sympathy routine on you to make you think he's starving to death which i'm sure he's not with him scratching on your cabinet door the way he does he's trying to convince you that he's in dire need of food cats can be great actors too lol once you start feeding any outside cat you made a friend for life all it takes is one bowl of food or milk and the cat will think your house is his house too cats like dogs eat grass once in a while to clean their stomachs out it's something that animals have done for ever so the only thing i can tell you to do is don't give him anymore milk and don't feed him if you continue to do this he will come around more and more and probably not want to leave your house it's okay to pet him and talk to him but don't feed him anything i hope this advice helps you out  Cat RuneScape quests Garfield Shaggy dog story Fancy rat Hamster Domestic rabbit AFI 100 Years series Taboo food and drink Breastfeeding Salad Fingers Pet skunk Kodocha The Amber Spyglass Dog Chicken Trailer Park Boys The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Star Wars Holiday Special Livestock Homer Simpson Animal communication Kashrut Hedgehog Fecal incontinence The Time Machine Pitaten Ron and Fez Catscratch Little Britain Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Animal rights Dairy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Abstraction (computer science) One Piece minor characters Kitten Andrew Dice Clay Spanish verbs Kim Possible Stomach cancer The Fairly OddParents YuYu Hakusho The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Phoebe Buffay's songs Ralston Purina Company Friends 1957 World Series Toilet humour Rent (musical) Spot (Star Trek) John the Baptist Neighbours CatDog Ranma __ characters Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Anorexia nervosa Bat Neopets Social rule Organic farming Kakapo Chocolate Invader Zim Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Hansel und Gretel The Super Milk-chan Show The Lovely Bones Lycanthropy Johnny 5 The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Japanese tea ceremony Kangaroo Goat English grammar The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Kosher foods 613 mitzvot W.I.T.C.H.

changed cat's feeding schedule strictly indoor cat my cat was eating cup x a day she asked for more so i asked the vet and he said a cup a day was fine so i started feeding her cup x a day occasionaly i go out of town for few days i haven't since i've had her my mom will come over twice a day to feed her but not x so i started feeding her a cup twice a day at noon and midnight she eats all of her food within hours she has not begged for more is it ok for her to eat like this all of the other cat's i've ever had ate their food slowly over the course of a day when she was being fed three and four times a day she would eat all of her food at once she's been to the vet recently and she is healthy she appears to be happy also once in a great while she will produce a stool that is tinged with blood the vet says it should resolve the next day and it always does will her feeding changes affect her getting a blood tinged stool she's had several negative fecals and the blood is always gone the next day she eats dry food only it makes sense what one person said about wet cat food i am a little worried that introducing something new might give her a diarhea cats need canned food as well as dry food each day can food supplies the oils and vitamins that they need in their daily diet for healthy skin hair nails and bones it's best to feed canned food in the morning and have dry food available throughout the day with fresh water sounds very much to me that she is not satisfied with what you are giving her something is missing in her diet and her body is sending her that message serving dry food only is rough on the digestion system and this could be the cause of the blood in the stool good luck  Guinea pig Stomach cancer Nutrition Cat Domestic rabbit Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dairy Dietary fiber Anemia Vitamin C Hamster Fancy rat Coeliac disease Ferret Pet skunk Raw food diet Vitamin D Dieting Veganism Botulism Feces Ramen Tlingit Vegetarianism Prostate cancer Peanut Folic acid Atkins Nutritional Approach Vitamin Taboo food and drink Omega-3 fatty acid Protein-energy malnutrition Vermicompost Hypoglycemia Domesticated turkey Vomiting Garlic Diarrhea Healthy eating Sea-Monkey Escherichia coli O157:H7 Entamoeba histolytica Garfield Albatross Acne Food Irritable bowel syndrome Fasting Domestic goat Fugu Dehydration Livestock Tasmanian Devil Colorectal cancer Foie gras Paget's disease of bone Cat food Radiation therapy Vegetarian nutrition Adjustable gastric band Chili con carne Carbon dioxide Binge eating disorder Gastroparesis Chronic fatigue syndrome Shaggy dog story Coffee Chinchilla Crohn's disease Terri Schiavo Sauerkraut Coprophagia Apple Bread Bat Certified Nursing Assistant Seabird Jewish cuisine

how often should you feed indoor cats i feed them whenever they run to their bowls but they are getting too fat and i'd like to get them on a regular schedule what's good once a day twice a day how much per serving thank you if they're getting fat feed them twice a day once in the morning and once in the afternoon both in the morning and afternoon fill the bowls and don't refill it until the next time choose a time for morning and afternoon and only fill at that time in the morning try to make it before and afternoon after but before pm move their bowls to different places so that you know how much each cat is eating because normally when you limit your pet's food intake they might eat out of each other's bowls if you go to fill at afternoon or morning and there's some food left just fill the bowl again but try to make it less eg if you put mg and by afternoon there's mg left only put mg not more you can lessen the food also if they're taking eating less also change the food to a weight control diet which consists mostly of fibre so it has less energy thus lessening the fattening effect of the cat food just tell your vet to give you a bag of weight control cat food whatever cat food it is if you buy from a supermarket just check the bag for the amount per serving the bag normally says how much is good but try not to make it more than two cups since it makes the cat fat two cups should equal about mg as for what's good prescription diets the ones that you get ffrom your vet are better than brand names iams isn't bad but it's not as controlled as prescription because they go dor taste not as much as health which i personally think is more important also if your cat doesn't like the food alot it would eat less so less fat if you have anymore question just email or write on the question warning this is if your cat is under years old remember young cats need more food so never limit them but this is only if they are under  Ramen Dieting Chocolate Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Domestic rabbit Garfield Tofu Anorexia nervosa Guinea pig Milk Fancy rat Dietary fiber Low-carbohydrate diet Hamster Nutrition Super Size Me Obesity Hypoglycemia Cat Breakfast Customs and etiquette of Japan Tea Livestock Chili con carne Stomach cancer Omega-3 fatty acid Ferret Vitamin C Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Vegetarianism South Beach diet Bodybuilding Food guide pyramid Veganism Folic acid Pet skunk Breastfeeding Meal Raw food diet Little Britain Weight training Japanese tea ceremony National Football League Dairy Sugar substitute Fecal incontinence Weight loss Dim sum English cricket team Homer Simpson Hamburger Chicken Binge eating disorder Adjustable gastric band Caffeine Neopets Cuisine of Malaysia Healthy eating Flatulence Tooth enamel Mattress Insulin Ron and Fez Cuisine of Denmark Chinese food therapy Fasting Publicly funded medicine Fast bowling Acorn Cat food Carburetor Soft drink Domesticated turkey Daylight saving time Fugu Cuisine of the Philippines Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Hypertension Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Stanley Cup Overpopulation Margarine Oreo Diabetes mellitus Fast food Food Bread Poker jargon Famine Roman eating and drinking Dorama Thermoregulation Weight Watchers

how do i integrate my cats into my mom's house with her old cat i moved home a month ago after being on my own for a month and brought my two female cats with me they're a year old the problem lies with my mom's year old female cat who doesn't want them in 'her' house i keep my cats in my room all day their food and litter is in there so when anyone gets home after work we let them out and they run around and get their energy out like they're supposed to any time they encounter my mom's cat they get into hissing fights and 'bat' each other with their paws it hasn't gotten really bad yet but it's literally been four weeks since we moved there and it hasn't gotten any better any suggestions how we can improve the situation has anyone else gone through this and if so how long did it take for the dust to settle i can relate to your situation in that i brought two kittens into my home after my oldest cat succumbed to thyroid disease complications i had one surviving older cat who may or may not have been happy to have the house to herself the kittens were four and seven months and my older cat was sure there was growling and hissing but while they had no choice but to mingle my older cat was not happy part of her unhappiness was the fact that they had so much energy the older cat is used to being the alpha cat in the house part of her hissing and growling is to tell the newcomers who is boss but some of it may be annoyance at these new turbo charged balls of fur four weeks is perhaps a bit too soon although if all you are dealing with is hissing that is really not a big deal your two youngsters are used to each other and will likely take a lot of energy out on each other allowing the older cat to adjust and batting i found that more amusing than of a concern fortunately i was able to be around for most of the time so i never kept them separated if there really isn't any blood being drawn then i would suggest it be 'open house' so the older cat understands they are here to stay by keeping them separated all these weeks but only letting them out at night may be comparable to a new situation each night it has been almost four years since the kittens came into my house it has worked out wonderfully and it didn't take anywhere near four years to have that result probably a couple of months and the kitten that was continually put into the submission position by my older cat are now good friends and the smallest kitten thinks she is alpha  Cat Ferret Pitaten Friends Dog training Garfield Theory of conduct Pet skunk Kitten Phoebe Buffay's songs Poker jargon Cats (musical) Alger Hiss Doomsday argument Babe Ruth Domestic rabbit Shaggy dog story Akuma (Street Fighter) Dog Piccolo Junior Saga Manx (cat) Badly Drawn Kitties Ron and Fez Thermoregulation Feral cat Pok__mon Live!

how do you think 'my' cat's doing it's about a stray cat that comes to my house every day about weeks ago i found out that she got pregnant and bought some cat food and fed her quite enough to be nurtured yesterday she was gone for whole day and when she showed up i noticed that she was no longer obese in other words i guess she gave birth as soon as she finished her meal she left but showed up few hours later to stay only about ten minutes do you think her babies are doing okay i looked at the nipples to get some clue and noticed they were pink and exposed than they used to be also do cats usually leave their babies for a while after giving them birth i think her babies are doing fine and that she is doing okay too she needs to come eat and they are in a safe place sometimes she just needs to take a break and sleep for a bit before going back to them write down the date you noticed she had given birth it may be hard to remember what day it was later when it is time to estimate their ages the best thing you can do is to gain her trust feed her good quality kitten chow so that she has all the protein and nutrition she needs to feed them well purina is good and pet the kittens when she starts bringing them to you the kittens will be much easier to find homes for if they are used to people my two beautiful cats were kittens from stray moms who had them they are both very wonderful because they were socialized very well to love and trust humans http cats about com od kittencare ss track weeks htm here is very good advice for you as well as good pictures and what to expect of the babies at each week by the way talk to a vet about possible fleas if you see the mom or babies scratching some over the counter medications are too strong and are dangerous to a normal cat let alone to a nursing mom  Guinea pig Garfield Ferret Kitten Phoebe Buffay's songs Dog Pet skunk Feral cat RuneScape quests Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Childbirth Pregnancy Ralston Purina Company Neighbours Coeliac disease Hamster Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kodocha Fancy rat Elephant EastEnders Flea Stomach cancer Piccolo Junior Saga Hey Jude Nutrition The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Friends Cliff Richard Obstetrics Girly Nestl__ Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Domestic rabbit Infant Laura Schlessinger Jon Secada Obesity Chicken Knots Landing Socialization Bat Egg (food) Fasting The Adventures of Pete & Pete Manx (cat) Blue Whale Raw food diet Big Brother UK series 5 Rent (musical) I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Folic acid Shaggy dog story The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Terri Schiavo Premature birth Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Code: Lyoko B3ta Atomic Kitten The Inside W.I.T.C.H.

my ne year old cat was wearing a flea collar and got her bottom jaw caught in it and was like that for at least two hours or so until i arrived back home and her mouth was really chapped with a little blood what should i do will she get poisoned from this i'd call the vet and ask his opinion if i were you it probably won't do her any harm if it was only in her mouth a couple of hours but use of flea collars is associated with x chance of mouth cancer in cats take the collar off permanently though flea collars don't kill fleas worth a darn and since they aren't stretchy or breakaway something like this is always a danger the collars can also get caught on twigs and fences and the cat strangles or is trapped there as it starves dies of thirst or a predator finds it for flea control get some advantage or frontline from a vet a dose that kills fleas for at least a month only costs about and it won't harm the cat stay away from flea stuff you can buy over the counter at a pet store or grocery store most don't work anyway and some are very toxic to cats  Dog Feral cat Ferret Flea Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Richard Chase Fugu Fox hunting Tobacco Stomach cancer Cat Red Hot Chili Peppers Shaggy dog story Trapping Ragwort Equine conformation Kakapo Guinea pig Collar Hamster Chocolate Fancy rat Spider Pet skunk Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Manual transmission Gray Wolf Dog collar Poison The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Mosquito Menstrual cycle Jaws (film) RuneScape quests Radiation poisoning Shark Diseases of the honeybee Tasmanian Devil RuneScape locations Cigarette Wal-Mart Rat poison Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Microchip implant (animal) Flea market Hyperthermia The Dalek Invasion of Earth Tobacco smoking Rabies Snake The Inside Birth control Phoebe Buffay's songs Tooth enamel Garfield Vegeta Suicide methods Nile crocodile Glossary of American football Rebreather Poker jargon Deadly nightshade Chronic fatigue syndrome S__rla ____ttr Dilbert Sin City Bladderwort DDT Diabetes mellitus Animal communication Taboo food and drink Alien (film) Minor Discworld characters Hedgehog Cheetah Siege Tooth Coffee Cyanide Bone marrow transplant Piccolo (Dragon Ball) People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Minor Harry Potter Beasts Raw food diet Ozzie, Slash, and Flea Bat Boy Kryptonite Phantom cat Death Comes to Time Neopets Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Ionizing radiation Tiny Toon Adventures Blue Whale Chinchilla Cancer Hydrogen peroxide Dog training

my cat died of suspected kidney failure have you experienced this my beautiful cat whom i've had for seventeen years was put to sleep last night by a vet for a while she'd been going downhill but was still so so loving only that morning she had jumped on my bed for a snuggle late yesterday i had discovered she'd vomited a clear foamy vomit i also noticed blood drops on the floor she had blood in her urine and couldn't control the dripping as any responsible pet owner would i rushed her to an emergency vet clinic i was then told that if i was to medicate her it would only prolong her life not make her better i was given the option of euthanasia and after assessing my fear of losing her to her pain i chose the right option to have her put to sleep it happened so fast and i'm shocked i just need to know if i didn't chose to have her put to sleep would have the blood in the urine have stopped did i make the wrong decision i just miss my cat so much and would like to hear from anyone who has experienced this i can't thank all of you enough i have tears running down my face at your kindness thank you for helping me through this loss this has made such a huge difference i buried her under our mandarin tree with a jumper i made her i have just been reading the answers to your question and it has helped me make the very difficult decision for my cat blue he has had ongoing kidney problems for along time now and just spent more days in the animal hospital on iv he's had a lot of stays there we are so reluctant to put him down because he is only years old and such a beautiful loving cat also we have his brother who will be lost without him they are so close we brought him back home hoping he would come around but he is only getting worse we cannot watch him suffer anymore and are taking him back to the vets today to be put to sleep we have cried oceans of tears but we love him enough to let him go thank you for showing us that our love for him as your love for your's makes it the right thing and the best thing thank you and god bless  EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Shaggy dog story The Amber Spyglass Miss Saigon Urinary incontinence Sin City Milton H.

help for newborn orphaned kittens ok i found a newborn kitten in the road by my parked car and there was no mom anywhere but there was a trail of blood and birthing fluids leading to my shed where i found another kitten and still no mom so i moved the kitten from the road to the shed and wiated in my house and the mom never came back and they were still wet they hadn't even been cleaned yet so i took them in and did what most websights say to do all of the websights said to stimulate them to go potty however they don't poop when i stimulate them too they do pee but they just started going on their own but it's pretty runny is that ok they are eating good also all the websights said that there poop should be a mustard yellow but it is a dark brown is that ok i heard greyish and white are really bad but i didn't hear anything about dark brown finally i am sure they didn't get their mom's first milk what are their chances fro survival will they have long term health problems it is wonderful that you have taken on such a daunting task i have posted a link on newborn kitten care and they likely have worms having gotten it from their mother the mother gets the worms from the critters she catches but that is a vet issue right now keeping them hydrated is a key concern in the link i posted there is a section on orphans which you definitely have the special milk that is sold in pet stores will be adequate just a doll baby bottle would probably be the right size again there are hints in the link i provided as far as survival you are giving them a far better chance than they would do otherwise consider that a step towards victory  Breastfeeding Kitten Childbirth Infant Pet skunk Cat Guinea pig Milk Cytomegalovirus Domestic rabbit Chocolate Dairy Toilet humour Kodocha Ferret Pitaten Phoebe Buffay's songs Hamster Premature birth Kyle Broflovski Garfield Urinary incontinence Futurama (TV series - season 2) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder The Marshall Mathers LP Hypoglycemia Married... with Children Knots Landing Eric Cartman Ron and Fez Fancy rat Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Insulin Kashrut Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Terri Schiavo Internet phenomenon The Fairly OddParents Kimi Finster EastEnders Blood (computer game) In vitro fertilisation Joke Joy Division (band) Aerial (dance move) Time Out of Mind Elephant Prostate cancer Shit Herpes simplex virus Tag Snake Jackass: The Movie Social rule Chicago Cubs Adoption Red Hot Chili Peppers Grandview, U.S.A.
