when do you start potty training how my son is months old i was wondering when i should start potty training him he's expressed an interest or should i say a fascination with the toilet lately he loves to flush it thinks it's neat when mommy daddy use it to pee i read one of the signs of readiness is if they have a dry diaper for a few hours but he's never had that anyone have any good tips dry diapers for a few hours dry nighttime diapers able to tell you he has to potty wanting to try sitting on the potty knowledge of when he has to potty like if he pees and realizes he peed or knows he has to poop and goes away to hide to potty the average boy is years old when they pottytrain boys take longer they have to learn to eventually stand to pee then they have to sit to poop so they find it more confusing at first let your son watch your husband pee and he will learn faster how to stand and pee but remember to be patient when you do start until he can tell you he has to potty or he did potty he isn't even close to ready he also needs to be able to get his pants up and down by himself  Toilet training Toilet Urinary incontinence Elimination communication Infantilism Diaper Japanese toilet Shaggy dog story Milton H.

has anyone's child actually been expelled from preschool for potty accidents my son is years old and has been pretty much potty trained for a few months wears a diaper at night only he starts preschool next week and the school requires all children to be fully potty trained they said that they understand kids sometimes have accidents and that's why we'll need to provide extra clothing just in case my son always knows when he has to go and will go on his own to the potty though sometimes he has accidents from waiting too long what has your experience been with preschools that require children to be potty trained before enrolling how many accidents are too many do the teachers ever remind the children to go to the potty my friends who have children who go to this school say not to worry but i can't help it of course i'll be asking the teachers these same questions at orientation but i'd like to know what other people's experiences have been thanks so much regards mari relax the only reason your child would be expelled from any great daycare and obviously you picked a great one or else you wouldn't part with your child is because they are too agressive and endanger other children every daycare i've worked at with or observed i used to work for the state has a schedule with at least potty times built into it through out the day if not many more plus the children are free to tell the teacher when they need to go usually before and after nap and around snack or meal times the whole class will have a chance to go its great because it also teaches kids to wait in line to respect others etc like you said kids do have accidents and you should provide extra clothes and undies for such situations but in my experience unless a child was not fully trained before daycare of is having major issues that they can't deal with i e parents are fighting at home so child regresses kids continue to be potty trained at school and do well good luck  Day care Kimberly-Clark Corporation Kindergarten Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Diaper Parenting Infantilism Education in Japan Education in Taiwan Education in Germany McMartin preschool Montessori method Social rule Urinary incontinence Elimination communication Early childhood education Martial art The Fairly OddParents Education in Romania Teacher Education About a Boy Recess (TV series) No Child Left Behind Act Daylight saving time Dissociative identity disorder Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Housebreaking Japanese tea ceremony Kodocha Education in Albania French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Tripartite System The Catcher in the Rye School choice Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Separation of church and state in the United States The Contender (television series) Education in Hong Kong Hikikomori College Reiki The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Education in Portugal Education in France Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Education in Australia The Karate Kid, Part III Aikido Crate training Danish Folkeskole Education Transsexuality Humphrey Bogart Boarding school Laura Schlessinger Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Bash Street Kids Hillary Rodham Clinton Dog training Culture of the United States Charter school Professor RuneScape Brown v.

how do you feed a very picky child my daughter is and wants to eat nothing but peanut butter and bread if she is made to eat something else she makes herself sick she eat just a few bites of food of her choice yesterday and has eat nothing but two little bites of biscut and gravey today she got sick this evening from not eating and said she was ready to eat after eating very little got sick again i don't have any idea what to do to get her to eat different types of food i had her doctor tell me that she'd eat when she gets hungry to make her eat what we eat that doesn't work and now i am at a dead end as to what to do please help okay your daughter is actually 'making herself throw up' and isn't actually 'getting sick' this is something i learned from a person who did that even as young as three and did it all of his life his mother was a terrible cook what you need to do is to 'distract' your daughter from her 'pickiness' by 'accenting it' tell her that you know that she 'loves peanut butter and bread' but that you think that she's 'just picky enough' to learn to 'really enjoy' other 'foods' that most kids never try then the two of you should 'go out to lunch' at someplace where she can't get her 'peanut butter and bread' and 'try something totally new' perhaps some 'steamed fish' with some 'fresh vegies' steamed don't make her eat 'a lot' but let her 'decide' what to try and when she's 'done' you can 'pull out' a peanut butter brownie she loves peanut butter which is actually a very good source of protein and she won't want to 'throw up' with that 'brownie' sitting on 'top of' the other food then 'go shopping' and don't buy peanut butter or 'her type of bread' but buy 'lean and tasty fresh foods' that she can 'nibble on' and then have 'half' of her 'peanut butter on good bread' for 'dessert again with that peanut butter on top she's not going to want to 'throw up' give it time and be 'extremely patient' but engage your daughter in 'buying and preparing new foods' and emphasize that 'other kids don't have your good taste in food' and your daughter will soon be a 'real foodie' and will stay 'slim' but be 'engaged in eating healthy' her whole life  Breakfast Bread Cuisine of Denmark Tofu Peanut butter Cuisine of the Philippines Peanut Hamburger French cuisine Japanese cuisine Pizza Jewish cuisine Butter Ramen Cuisine of Malaysia Food German cuisine Peanut butter and jelly sandwich Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Vegetarian cuisine Cuisine of Singapore Comanche Cuisine of the Southern United States Cuisine of Brazil Veganism Pancake Bagel Chinese cuisine Garfield Singlish Fecal incontinence Passover Chocolate Sandwich Fish and chips Dim sum The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Dairy Hot dog Chili con carne Shaggy dog story Porridge Dieting Cookie British cuisine Kodocha The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Cuisine of Africa Domesticated turkey French fries Hansel und Gretel About a Boy Yakitate!!

what are your thoughs on baby leashes or harnesses i recently bought my month old one i feel a little embarrased sometimes but i do it for her safety last month she ran out in front of a car and her grandma yanked her by the arm and pulled her arm out of socket so now im afraid to even touch her arm my daughter likes to walk and she's too heavy to carry ive heard people say how degrading they are and mean but i feel its ok since its for her protection what are your thoughts only serious ones please excuse me destiny but i am grateful to my mother in law i'd much rather she hurt her arm then get hit by a car and no my child wont hold my hand she's a baby she wants to run around so if your not going to be helpful to my question why dont you go answer someon elses question to all you people who said that a leash is for a dog and to either teach your kid to stay by your side or use a stroller do not take their young children for walks it is hard for a young child to understand that running infront of a car is dangerous it is even harder for them to hear even the best of parents that tell them no stop or any other appropriate word of caution it is not at all comfortable or natural for a young child to hold hands all the time when walking if you are tall it can actually become painful when they don't have to stretch to hold your hand they are old enough to not need a leash and be able to mind you this can be anywhere between and it is a great idea for any child under the age of to be leashed or harnessed when they are in a place the that can slip out of your hand and get hurt or kidnapped be it the sidewalk supermarket or amusement park also there is no exercise benefit or independence for a child in a stroller not to say that they won't like it for people that don't have access to large areas that their children can run about a walk around the block or through the mall is great for them it lets them explore things and help promote an active lifestyle any parent that does think that a leash is degrading should also remember that these are little people that poop in their pants suck on bottles and scream and throw themselves on the floor when they don't get their way the degrading part is to the parent who is more worried about their image than that of their childs safety  Dog training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breastfeeding Aerial (dance move) Humphrey Bogart The Shining (film) Baby transport Kodocha Shaggy dog story Jon Secada Obedience training EastEnders Kitesurfing Escalator Futurama (TV series - season 5) About a Boy Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Satchel Paige 2000 Australian Grand Prix Infantilism Professional wrestling match types Strap-on dildo Singlish Father's Day (Doctor Who) Yoko Ono Trailer Park Boys Professional wrestling holds Ten Commandments Knots Landing Sin City Rose (Doctor Who) War of the Worlds (2005 film) Ayyavazhi mythology Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Reservoir Dogs Equine conformation Jam (TV series) Horse tack Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Death Gate Cycle Ben Johnson (athlete) Rais massacre Glossary of American football Scenes from a Memory Childbirth Maison Ikkoku The Human Stain Social rule Characters of Lost Jackass: The Movie Adoption Journey (band) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Time Out of Mind Hitchhiking The Inside Sailing Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Professional wrestling throws Toilet humour Paragliding Columbine High School massacre School bus The Apprentice 2 Kyle Broflovski The Curse of Fenric Montgomery Burns Bondage (BDSM) Fathers' rights Piccolo Junior Saga Transactional analysis Ty Cobb Swingout The Life and Times of Juniper Lee A Course In Miracles The Parting of the Ways Melanie Wilkes The Lovely Bones Theory of conduct Volleyball Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Infant Russian joke The Marshall Mathers LP Incarnations of Immortality

does anybody know a fool proof way to potty train a boy i have tried almost everything but nothing seems to work personally i dont think he is ready but everyone else think he should be trained by now he is years i just potty trained my son and daughter and i used the potty stool http www thepottystool com i started by just setting it at the toilet my kids immediately climbed up on the stool and discovered that they could safely use the toilet this got them very interested in using the toilet and they were potty trained very quickly it really helps boys to pee standing up so they can see what is happening and connect the sensations i like that i don't have to double the steps of potty training by training them first in a potty and then training them to stop using a potty and not dumping and cleaning a potty each time is great the best thing is that kids use it for years i hope this helps you  Toilet Toilet humour Toilet training Fecal incontinence Elimination communication Sento Japanese toilet Urinary incontinence Shaggy dog story Aerial (dance move) SpongeBob SquarePants The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Urination Kimberly-Clark Corporation Stomach cancer Feral child AFI 100 Years series El Chavo del Ocho Parenting Bristol Grammar School Kimi Finster Washroom Uniform Resource Locator Alan Arnett McLeod Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Jackass: The Movie Urine Train station The Sims West Bromwich Albion F.C.

i need tips for babysitting ok im going to be babysitting two little girls ones about the others a year younger ive known them since birth but this is my first time babysitting and im only it will be darkish outside from any ideas they will probably be going to bed by anyway so you don't need to worry too much about things to do with them i suggest playing with them indoors letting them show you how they play with their toys and maybe having a favorite childhood movie on in the background babysitting is easy just don't give them too much to do let them decide what to do and just have fun doing it and supervising just make sure to follow any house rules to the letter and that they are in bed on time  Calvin and Hobbes The Fairly OddParents Tag EastEnders Garfield Lizzie McGuire Stewie Griffin FoxTrot The Adventures of Pete & Pete Social rule Milton H.

best sling carrier for toddler hello i would like some advice on the best sling for carrying a toddler i would like something that will work up to lbs personal experience only please the ergo is the best i still use it for my lb yr old when she gets too tired at the zoo the ergo baby carrier's ergonomic design supports a correct sitting position for the baby's hip pelvis and spine growth it disperses most of the baby's weight between the hips and thighs which helps to eliminate compression of the spine when hanging by the crotch which most other designs require the ergo also balances the baby's weight to parents' hips and shoulders and alleviates physical stress for the parent here's a photo gallery http www ergobabycarrier com gallery they also sell an insert for infants to be in a sling type cradled position soooo worth the money mei tai styles are good too but my husband does not like the look of them too girly the ergo is more backpack like and has man buckles so for us it was the more versatile choice  Professional wrestling holds Breastfeeding Equine conformation Urinary incontinence Mattress Professional wrestling throws Breech birth Casualty lifting Childbirth Sling (weapon) Glossary of climbing terms Human position Aerial (dance move) Duchenne muscular dystrophy Scuba set Glossary of partner dance terms Tai Chi Chuan Backpack Strap-on dildo Prostate cancer Car safety Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chair Puberty Infant Undergarment Obstetrics High-heeled shoe Gas metal arc welding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rigging Weight training Piledriver (professional wrestling) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Abortion debate Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Osteoporosis Scoliosis Spanking Deadlift Alexander Technique Sniper Hip (anatomy) Tire F-16 Fighting Falcon Truss Infantilism Adoption Premature birth Swingout Horse Bicycle Breaststroke The Sims 2 Wan Chai Bass guitar Dyspareunia Cancer Osteoarthritis Iliotibial band syndrome Human anatomy Glossary of ballet terms Airbus A380 Professional wrestling attacks Nutrition Crash test dummy M16 (rifle) RX-78 mobile suit series Weapon Paget's disease of bone Lead and follow (dance) Sexual differentiation World Wide Web Tank Wireless Application Protocol Repetitive strain injury Climbing equipment Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk Pole vault Pelvis Kimberly-Clark Corporation Federal Standard 1037C MS-06 Zaku II Helicopter Holster Jet engine Airsoft Hydrogen economy Phonograph Orthopedic surgery Truss bridge Double bass Abortion Butterfly stroke F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Cerebral palsy Hip dysplasia

is taking your child to the playground every day a bad idea i've been taking my daughter to the playground everyday for the past week and today i just felt like i let her down cause we couldnt go and she kept asking all day to go to the playground now i feel bad the playground isnt that far from where we live either it's about blocks and she's only so i wouldnt dare let her go alone so was it a bad idea to get her into the idea of us going every day i have free time now and i want to do something fun with her here at the house to hopefully take her mind off of the playground until at least tomorrow or the next day what do you think i don't think taking her every day is a bad idea at all children need physical activity you just need to explain to her that you there will be times when you can't take her she would most likely be upset even if you said no and you hadn't taken her every day don't feel bad about not taking her she has to learn that not everything in life will go exactly the way you want it  Playground Pitaten Scientology beliefs and practices Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Milton H.

tantrum question for toddler months old ok so it goes you'd think i'd have this down by now seeing she is my rd but boy oh boy is she feisty and demanding she's even more strong willed than my other two were at this age i feel like i've met my match my little twin she was born on my birthday march th my dad told me when i was her age i used to hold my breath and turn blue when i would get mad last night she woke me up and decided she wanted to go into the living room at am i said no go back to sleep she threw the biggest tantrum for min do you think putting her in her crib when she throws a tantrum during the day is ok or will she then associate her crib with discipline she's too little to stay in time out anywhere else she sleeps with me at night because she's still nursing so she'll be sleeping with me until we're done with that how do i deal with her tantrums and how if possible can i avoid them the issue here is not nursing and that is a choice that i have made it worked fine for my other two and they both sleep fine in their own beds i know she doesn't need to nurse at night i'm asking about the tantrums not if i should still be nursing my daughter and when thx my husband used to hold his breathe and turn blue too when he was little our son just turned months and he's a fiesty little kid too you can use the crib but run the risk of associating it with tantrums i'm sure its hard enough to get her to sleep in it since she's used to sleeping with you its great that your still nursing but shouldn't she be sleeping through the night without waking for food my son wouldn't sleep through til we moved into his own room and crib as far as the tantrums go we have a playpen we use for those moments when our son needs to be seperated from the issue it's more for me than him though so i can let him scream and know he's safe and i can go into a another room so i don't have a tantrum too most times he responds well to just removing him from the situation distraction with something he is able to do don't respond until she is calm i've discovered that he tends to fuss more if i respond to him also try not to let things go one day and then say no to it the next with time she'll learn whats expected and whats not sometimes though we just need to think about that our kids are people too haven't you ever woke up at night and not be able to sleep or haven't you wanted to eat chips and cookies instead of your veggies i'm not saying to just let her do what she wants just remember that kids have their own needs ands wants and sometimes they don't jive with ours  Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Teen Girl Squad The Shining (film) EastEnders Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Sin City Friends Breath of Fire III Avenue Q The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Theory of conduct The Big Sleep Social rule Humphrey Bogart Miss Saigon The Death Gate Cycle 50 First Dates 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Amber Spyglass House of M The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Urinary incontinence Vegeta Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Autism Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Little Britain Babe Ruth Big Brother UK series 6 W.I.T.C.H.

how can i make him stop throwing things hello i have a son who is almost years old he has autism spectrum disorder and sensory needs i have him in behavior therapy hours a week as well as hours of speech and ocupasional therapy i can not get his behavior under control he throws everything toys food drink etc everything he gets his hands on he throws he even hurts people by throwing toys intentionally at them i don't know what to do i have tried spanking tried slapping his hand tried time out tried re directing him to something else to play with tried picking up the toys and asking him to hand them to me or put them away i have tried everything i have heard to try i even did what the therapist sugested and still he keeps throwing argggg if you have any sugestions please help thank you most year olds experiment with cause and effect and throwing is unfortunately a great way to learn how things work he throws something at someone and it gets a reaction be it positive or negative so a perfectly normal year is likely to experiment with throwing objects since your son has a spectrum disorder you may be battling with it for a bit longer than others but if you are consistent it should subside with time how is your son at communicating the throwing behavior especially at other kids may be his way of expressing frustration or distaste for the situation being autistic he is likely easily upset and if you are able to get him out of the situation before he reaches the boiling point you can avoid some of the throwing scenarios you can also offer him plenty of soft toys so that if the throwing continues at least he won't hurt other children around him good luck and remember that at he really isn't doing this behavior to hurt others or cause you any heartache he is simply trying his best to figure out the world around him  Autism Controversies in autism Traumatic incident reduction Sensory Integration Dysfunction Dog training Obsessive-compulsive disorder Autistic spectrum Transactional analysis Pervasive developmental disorder Spanking Milton H.

how do i make my daughters th birthday special we have just moved from virginia to texas last month and my daughter just started at her new daycare today her birthday is on the st of august what can we do to make her th birthday special i feel really bad that she really doesn't have any friends yet i know we could have a family party but really there are no kids in the family to invite would it be too early to give her classmates invitations to her birthday party if that is a good idea should the party be at our apartment or maybe chuck e cheeses or gymboree maybe i could really use some advice and suggestions for my children their th birthday was really the first time that they were conscious of having a birthday and a day in your honor i wouldn't focus so much on the birthday party itself but rather on making the whole day special maybe a big happy birthday sign when she wakes up with balloons everywhere instead of a single orgy of unwrapping presents which can be so overwhelming try distributing the gifts throughout the day so she can appreciate each one alot more the institutional birthday parties a la chuck e cheese are pretty simple and cheap to organize but i have yet to see any kid really enjoy themselves at them and believe me i have been to plenty the birthday kid feels they are not sufficiently the center of attention and the rest of the kids are ground down by the noise and crappy food cupcakes in the preschool classroom if permitted will definitely make her feel special i would suggest inviting two or three kids from her class over to your house for a playdate with a birthday cake instead of all of the kids she could care less about out to some noisy place some of the gymboree parties that i have been to have been pretty successful but if she doesn't have a bunch of friends to invite i think she would prefer just going someplace that she loves to go with her family and maybe a restaurant where they can make a big deal out of dessert  Birthday Cuisine of Denmark Kindergarten Spidey Super Stories Day care Friends Boston Public 50 First Dates The Ashlee Simpson Show Humphrey Bogart Happy Birthday to You Avenue Q Dr. Seuss W.I.T.C.H.

my month old son came home from visiting his father scared to death to take a bath does anyone know why he would be this way he loved the bath before he left and would sometimes take a day and does anyone have any ideas on how i could ease his fears well if i were you i would talk to his father and ask him if your son had taken a bath while he was there and if he says yes i would then ask if anything accidental happened while getting his bath such as slipping in the tub or choking on the water be very careful when asking him because if you sound as if you are accusing him of any wrong doing it won't end in a very good way usually when children get hurt doing something even if they loved it before will tend to get upset when having to be involved with whatever they got hurt on the next time it just might take a few times for him to start liking it again if that is the case i would start raising questions if everytime he gets back from his dads house he's afraid of taking a bath because then something could be going on that shouldn't be just pay very close attention without seeming obvious and if it happens again then notify someone that you are concerned with your sons safety at his fathers house  Social rule Shaggy dog story About a Boy Pitaten The Shining (film) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fathers' rights Plame affair Kodocha Customs and etiquette of Japan Diving The Human Stain Ranma __ characters Scenes from a Memory Milton H.

potty training hi im potty training for the first time i have read the books but not as good as people who have really been through it im training my first child i have the potty and she has done a wee wee once has any got any hints tips on how too make this go as smooth as possible i mean in the sense of do i let her walk around the whole day with no nappie how long do i sit her on there for when do i put her on there any help would be appriciated thanks first congrats to your little girl this is a big deal for her so let her know how grown up she is becoming when buying her new big girl underwear make it special for her by having a big girl's day out also letting her pick out her own underwear makes it a special event the thing with potty training you have to make it fun not a chore think up some neat little games i was lucky i have a boy so we just threw fruit loops in the toilet and told him to try and sink them teaches good aiming skills too since you have a girl why not get her a go potty doll i've seen them at toys r us and walmart little mini potty included she will be responsible for training her baby and will learn by teaching also learning by example works great take potty breaks together rewards work well too i used my little boy's favorite candy m m's keep them in a jar where they are visible but out of reach each time she goes potty allow her to pick two or three out of the jar if you don't want to go the candy route toddler cookies work great too any of her favorite bite size snacks will do try making a potty chart each time she goes to the potty she gets a star or she can mark it off herself when she goes potty a certain number of times then take her to her favorite park or chucky cheese's or let her pick out a new toy and most important lots of praise and hugs applaud dance sing whatever it takes to show her what a good job she is doing usually after drinking she should be ready to go in about to minutes unless she's got a large bladder pay attention to her after she drinks to pick up her potty habits she may stand still or crouch when she has to go potty some kids even hide especially if they know they are being trained if you can't catch any visible habits just start checking her pull up after about or minutes this will give you a timeline so you can time her potty breaks accordingly just remember keep a cool head kids are wonders at sensing stress and frustration this could have a reverse effect on her and she will associate going potty with mommy getting all tense and making a mad face in other words she will avoid the potty with a passion to avoid your reactions i wouldn't make her sit on the potty for an extended amount of time either this leads to more stress especially for her keep it a positive experience for her and you it will take time and perseverence and lots of patience so don't get too worked up about it if she doesn't pick it up immediately kids learn at their own pace and in time she'll get the hang of it just don't give up and revert back to diapers sends her the wrong message and allows her to think she can continue going potty however and whenever she pleases and when you get frustrated just remember how good it's going to feel when you get to finally bypass the diaper aisle best of luck  Urinary incontinence Dog training Rugrats Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jackass: The Movie Diaper Kimi Finster Fecal incontinence Kimberly-Clark Corporation Avenue Q Milton H.

how often do your kids change interests i am enjoying watching my daughter grow into her own individual self she is almost years old and i can't help but wonder what kinds of things will interest her later on in life right now her favorite things are babies animals and music which these have been her favorites pretty much since she was born she will either be a caregiver a vet or a singer when she grows up lol just kidding of course her interests can easily change as she gets older i'm wondering just how often those interests will change and how drastically lol right after we spend alot of money on one of their interests they decide they don't want to do it anymore  Humphrey Bogart Milton H.

strange toddler behavior beating up her imaginary friends i have a year old and she had imaginary friends already she will yell and kick them she will tell them to go away and dont touch her i dont know why but it kinda worries me is this normal sometimes she'll tlk to them and be friendly but most of the time she just yells and tries to get them to leave her alone imaginary friends show that your child is highly intelligent so please ignore the answers about sending her to see someone about this does your daughter have siblings the fact that she can show a distinction between her imaginary friends and everyone else just proves her intelligence my three yr old yells at her brother to leave her alone and does all the things you describe that yours is doing with her if please do not worry about this just make sure you are doing plenty with her to stimulate her congrats on such a bright child  Piccolo Junior Saga The Fairly OddParents Autism Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends The Smoking Room Tag Father's Day (Doctor Who) Knots Landing Le Malade imaginaire Asperger syndrome Big Brother UK series 6 Color Intelligence quotient Salad Fingers The Flintstones Beat generation Child sexuality The Marshall Mathers LP Atheism KaBlam!

dealing with my almost year old girl my daughter is almost four and i am watching an awful transformation we have gone from a completely angelic baby in every way to a whiney moaney child with horrendous selective hearing she breaks down at any minute little thing which has been going on for months i have tried all sorts of disciplining and more attention etc of this to no avail she is very selfish with her brother and screeches at him and lashes out at him he is two i want to know if the mood swings i am witnessing are normal for her age or if there is something we are doing not doing for her they talk about terrible twos but i think they are easy in comparison to three and four year olds your advice and experience would be greatly appreciated in this matter help mums p s she is in a lovely mood today i have implemented her going to her room anytime she screeches this morning which seems to be working so far but then it is only half way through the first day ah the fabulous fours it seems like every two years you get some new wild beast possessing your once wonderful child but here's the good news it's perfectly normal for your angel to turn into a screeching monster time to try a new tactic she's screeching and hitting because things aren't going her way she's getting frustrated and losing her temper these are emotions she's going to have to deal with her entire life she may as well start learning to cope with them now next time she starts getting crazy crouch right down to her eye level hold her shoulders or her head so she has to look right at you and tell her in a calm and soothing voice to take a deep breath then demonstrate for her by doing it yourself make her continue doing the deep breathing two or three more times until she's a little more calm then ask her to use a nice voice and tell you what's going on don't let her get ramped up again if she starts crying or screeching make her take a deep breath then remind her to use her nice voice let her tell you the situation in her own words then ask her questions to try to get her to see it from the other person's point of view was brother being mean when he did that or was it an accident then ask her what she thinks you should do about it ask her to come up with a fair solution you'd be surprised at what kids can come up with at four she's starting to see that other people have feelings too finish up by reiterating the positive outcome and making sure everyone apologizes if needed then it's hugs all around and happily ever after until the next blow up you accomplish several things this way you teach her some self control you end on a positive note and you involve her in the problem solving process plus all your friends will marvel at what a great parent you are strangers will approach you in the grocery store to tell you what a brilliant mom you are and teachers will be calling you to thank you for such a wonderfully behaved student okay maybe not but your life will be a little more calm until the next crisis  Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Jon Secada EastEnders The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Humphrey Bogart About a Boy Past teachings of Prem Rawat Milton H.

my month old won't drink anything two days ago my husband picked up our son from the babysitter's house and discovered his favorite bottle had a large hole in the side of the nipple he unthinkingly threw it away and gave him a sippy cup instead with his dinner my son who usually enjoys drinking out of sippies and cups with straws refused to drink out of it i went out and bought a similar bottle that same night but he still refused to take it it has been days now and i can tell he is so dehydrated from his dry diapers he will occassionally take a drink of milk or water from one of our cups but won't drink enough to keep him hydrated how can i remedy this before it gets ugly it's not that he doesn't want milk or juice or anything it's that he doesn't want to drink it out of anything but his old bottle since he is old enough to use even a normal cup the reason he refuses to drink is because of the emotional attatchment to the old bottle the older it gets the more the attachment my son stopped at yrs it was hell i suggest trying to rehydrate him by feeding him sips of water like a baby rather than leaving it up to him because u have a serious health issue on your hands i would be reluctant to offer sweet drinks because that is not healthy also while it is not enough liquid juicy whole fruits like oranges and strawberries will hydrate him a bit as a special treat take him out to buy a new cup babies that age are not impressed by ur a big boy now but the novelty of selecting a cup allow him any cup will create a sense of ownership  Baby bottle Breastfeeding Tea Breakfast Milk Wine Infantilism Dairy Alcoholic beverage Yerba mate Fecal incontinence Coffee Hamster Soft drink Bong Dehydration Cuisine of the Philippines Rehydration Ice cream Rum Infant Urinary incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart Drink Ship naming and launching Gatorade Champagne (beverage) Knots Landing Bubble tea Sin City Diarrhea Chocolate Beer Indianapolis 500 Hyperthermia Sake Cuisine of Denmark Tofu Vitamin C Rooibos Guinness Joke Characters in the Smurfs Piccolo Junior Saga Fanta Soy milk Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Coca-Cola Fasting Textile manufacturing Sugar beet Milkshake About a Boy Mountain Dew Watermelon Water Mango Poker jargon Jackass: The Movie Alcohol Insomnia Hangover Yoghurt Ron Weasley Chlorpromazine Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Cat Escherichia coli O157:H7 Cha chaan teng Gin Phil Hendrie The Super Milk-chan Show Drinking Japanese tea ceremony Tomato Nalgene Drinking game Domestic rabbit Phoebe Buffay's songs Food Wu-Tang Clan affiliates Shaggy dog story A Clockwork Orange Food preservation One Piece minor characters Fancy rat The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Ocean's Twelve Baby Blues Kitchen Diaper Vitasoy Beer Pong Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Genericized trademark Toilet humour Vodka

school background check my older sister has an austictic child who will be starting school soon she'll be in april well my sister is really afraid that the school will mistreat her daughter nobody else is worried and we all think it's a good school my sister has had to schedule meetings with the staff so they can see the child and make sure she's eligible for the special start program i don't think a school that checks out the children numerous times would abuse them but my sister says she's having nightmares she's worried that they're not going to see her as a child but as a retarded kid who's worthless i've tried talking sense into her but she's letting the stress affect her health i'm stationed in japan and i can't do much for her but tell her it will be ok how can she check out the school to see if it's ok she thinks if she asks the school directly they would lie to her would you admit to child abuse so how can she put her fears to rest i have an autistic child and she will be fine once the child is in school as parents of autistic children we tend to be overprotective anyway if she has scheduled meetings with the staff already met with them and toured the school that should alleviate some of her worries quite honestly my son's teachers always tell me how bright he is and the fact that he is so intelligent they have had to increase their standards for him to hold his interest i have had one problem with a teacher in his preschool she was of the mindset that all children should always sit still and never speak i teach kindergarten and was appaled by what i saw there so out he went her best bet is to do precisely what she did the visiting meeting etc it will be ok just keep reassuring her thank goodness you care so much even though you are so far away god bless  Education in the United States Autism Education in the People's Republic of China Gifted Infantilism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Autism rights movement Kodocha Controversies in autism Ethical challenges to autism treatment Milton H.

my mother in law thinks i should put bars across my yr old's windows so that he won't fall out is she crazy a lot of young children are seriously injured in falls from windows and one of the suggestions to fix that is to put bars on the windows so that they can not fall out especially if you are not in a one story although significant injury can occur then too in my personal opinion the bars are a bit extreme there are certainly other safety measures you can take here are a few ideas get a locking unit for the window which your child can not open but you easily can in an emergency very important make sure there are no toy boxes or other furniture near the window which could be used to climb upon and try to open the window or fall through the closed window just as dangerous if not more so than falling out of the open window talk to your two year old about the danger if there has been behavior that has your mil worried two year olds understand a lot more than we give them credit for and if you say mommy does not want you to open the window because you could fall out and get hurt they understand better than if you only say do not do that i always told my children why they could not do something and i think it helped basically just use your common sense as i said i think the bars are a bit extreme but it is a valid recommendation perhaps an incident has happened in her life or to someone she knows that makes her extra sensitive to the issue i do not think she is crazy she sounds like a concerned grandma i wish you the best  Traumatic brain injury Hamster Theory of conduct Rape The Shining (film) Autism About a Boy Second language acquisition Philosophy of language Infantilism Kodocha Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Microsoft Windows Salad Fingers Social rule Political economy Psychoanalysis Sexual orientation Road traffic accident Dog training Gravity Road safety Extreme Programming Milton H.

my daughter just turned years old please give me some discipline methods or what works for you she must always be the center of attention and is in the talk back stage and repeats a question hundreds of times until she gets a response she will start pre school next month and i hope that can calm her somewhat i am the man of the family and my wife does nothing to assist with discipline how does time out work and how would i use it put her on time out either on a cushion on the floor or on the couch same place each time if possible no toys no books no tv etc leave the room so she has no one to talk to but check on her secretly if you can if she gets up put her back only do this for minutes because that is a long time for a child it worked great for my son i even found him on time out once when he was five and he had put himself there for something he had done although i appreciated that i let him off it wasn't something i would have given him time out for anyway but anyway after a few time outs when she knows you are serious her behavior will change as far as the repeating of questions not to be a smart ass but it is far easier just to answer them when they are asked then she won't keep repeating them to get an answer good luck  Shaggy dog story Dog training Social rule 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Zhao Yun The Newlywed Game GED Plame affair timeline 1957 World Series Milton H.

how can i encourage my year old daughter to poop in the toilet she'll only pee she does all her urinating in the toilet but won't poo help i need to have her fully potty trained in a few weeks for preschool hmm a little bit more information from you would help where does she do poo if not in the toilet is she holding on to it i helped toitlet train my cousin she was having the exact same problem she would ask for a nappy to be put on so she could do a poo we discovered that she didn't like sitting on the toilet for too long because it was too hard and also she was afraid of the splash haha so we wrapped some handtowels around the seat and put a wad of toilet paper in the bottom of the toilet and sat her there and i painted her tow nails while she sat there which was very exciting for her and she did her first poop on the toilet she was so proud of herself and never had a problem again as a childcare worker i have also toilet trained children by reading to them on the toilet it helps to relax them and then the poop just happens good luck oh and with the preschool thing it she hasn't trained by then she will probably just hold onto her poop til she gets home so don't stress too much about the time frame she might feel your urgency in the matter and this won't help the situation  Shit Toilet humour Toilet Diaper Kimberly-Clark Corporation Urination Japanese toilet Fecal incontinence Toilet paper Ron and Fez Toilet training Dog training Pitaten Elimination communication Shaggy dog story Milton H.

how old should a child be before you can leave them alone in the bath tub i was talking about it at work with some ppl and we all said different things other than it depends on the child what is your thoughts on this topic that is a question that no two mothers will agree on you will get a range of answers it's really up to you when it comes down to the deciding factor i do agree it has a lot to do with your child if your child sits down and knows not to stand up then i think at the age of is ok to leave the child alone for a little while i'm not talking about hours i mean like min while you run to do something else if your child is very active in the tub then leaving the child is not a good idea until he she is years old you have to make sure there is only a little water in the tub and you have a skid proof mat so the child won't be sliding around me personally i think at the age of is ok i will leave my two kids in the tub for minutes while i get there pj's ready but for the most part i still always sit in the bathroom with them so at the age of years old i will probably trust that they will be ok in the bathtub you alwys make sure your in ear shot of the bathroom  Sento Customs and etiquette of Japan A Tale of a Tub Social rule Bathing Have I Got News For You Bathroom Hot tub The Inside Sant Mat Big Brother (USA TV series) The nature of God in Western theology Theory of conduct Columbine High School massacre Textile manufacturing Dymaxion house B-47 Stratojet Extreme Programming Aerial (dance move) Childbirth Justification (theology) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Coriolis effect Toilet Shawn Michaels Our Gang The Brady Bunch Shaggy dog story Brett Whiteley Sant Thakar Singh John Glenn Shake It Off Japanese tea ceremony Blood Simple SAT Current teachings of Prem Rawat Good Times GED Child sexuality Hearing impairment About a Boy Dutch Schultz The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

why does my little cousin eat dirt all the time my little cousin is like and whenever he is outside he just shoves handfuls of dirt into his mouth i swear its so weird and if we are with him we tell him no spit it out but he has a sandbox and when he gets in it he shoves it in his mouth whats wrong with him it might be a vitamin deficiency it could also be that your cousin is very oral some children at the age of two still are in that oral sensory stage the feel of sand may be a texture thing i would have him tested for the deficiency though you could also try offering him objects that give different oral experiences popsicles teething ring a frozen sponge can also help good luck  Teen Girl Squad Oral sex Cyanocobalamin Hypoglycemia Anorexia nervosa Condom Golden rice Acne Piccolo Junior Saga Hush...

why do you think toddlers and kids in general are all about pushing boundries i just posted a q about a day trial my year old and i had where she was trying to see what she could get away with lol shaking my head stubborn one she is and i'm all about consistancy and not giving in wonder where she got that stubborn streak so why do you think kids especially toddlers are consumed with pushing to see how far they can stretch the rules children push boundaries because they are testing to see how far they can go this is a normal part of development for all children some parents get angry and think children are being disrespectful and react to it by punishing them negatively if parents were to look at this kind of behavior as a normal part of childhood development they would be able to maintain control and help the child make better choices children don't know or aren't born knowing what is acceptable behavior or boundaries so we have to tell them what to do rather than telling them what not to do when you tell a child what not to do you are giving her negative attention plus telling them what not to do doesn't tell them what to do an example of this and try it your self and you'll see the difference in behavior is when your child is running in the house rather than saying don't run you can tell them what to do you can say walk automatically you'll see the the child walk its ok if you repeat yourself if the child is testing boundaries she'll continue to run then you can say would you like me to hold your hand and walk or would you like to walk on your own children under the age of six are searching to be autonomous they want to do it on their own this is why choices that you set up work so well with young children they are so eager to make their own choices it makes them feel big another popular phrase used by parents is your mean or rude these phrases only judge making the child feel bad or defensive its not helpful its hurtful instead it doesn't tell the child what to do instead you can say you can give her the doll in her hand the doll is for playing the doll is not a ball lets go outside and play catch the ball it all depends on the situation and its important that adults and teachers are there to see what happens when children make the wrong choice so that the teacher or parent can guide the child to problemsolve children are not stubborn they are persistent and it's a good thing that means that the child doesn't give up very easily this is part of a childs temperment it's important not to label your child as stubborn or tell anyone else that your child is stuborn because it gives her a negative image teachers should never label a child as stubborn as well instead you can say my child very persistent this says that she doesn't give up very eaisily this is not a bad quality the label stubborn is negative understanding your childs temperment is essential part of guiding your child positively there are lots of good books that explain temperment in children good luck  Social rule Theory of conduct Fast bowling Transactional analysis Infantilism Autism Nicomachean Ethics Milton H.

will the hospital allow my toddler to be there with me i'm scheduled for a cesarean in days i have a month old daughter who recently caught lice from a babysitter's house who failed to let me know she was having this problem since that was my planned babysitting option for my daughter while i was in the hospital with my newborn son i now don't have a babysitter i refuse to take her to that house of lice after this week of hell i've been through trying to get rid of the nasty bugs will they allow her to spend most of the day with me and my husband at the hospital my only plan we thought of was to have her spend most of the day with us in the hospital and for my husband to take her home during the night to rest and play and stuff he doesn't like the idea of leaving me alone at night in the hospital but my daughter's health is more important to me besides i'll have my newborn son to keep me company i wanted to ask just in case anyone else had experience with this will the hospital allow my daughter to be there daily to that first answerer i asked on here because that saves me from having to call the hospital and wait for a long time for an answer i asked for anyone who had experience with this for advice if you don't don't answer the question as for having family to watch her the babysitter was grandma who can't control the traffic in her house and hasn't been honest with me about it at all so i can't trust her any other family i have lives hours away lol so i'm kinda in a bind with that i thought about her getting pretty restless there so we're going to try to have lots for her to do hopefully it'll occupy her for most of it we've been in the hospital before where she was strapped down to the bed with rsv so hopefully she'll be happy she isn't on the hospital bed this time thank you for your answers as long as the baby's healthy and your daughter doesn't run wild she should be fine but from experience she will probably get restless after a few hours and will be hard to deal with my sister went through the same thing so her husband rented a hotel room next to the hospital do you have family that can help with her i would get a backup plan incase they don't let her or if she gets tired and cranky good luck with everything and congrats  EastEnders Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Knots Landing Avenue Q The Lovely Bones Breastfeeding Baby Blues Day care Calvin and Hobbes The Fairly OddParents Fiddler on the Roof The Catcher in the Rye Little Britain The Ashlee Simpson Show 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Soap opera Donald Rumsfeld Neighbours Pitaten Babe Ruth Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Irna Phillips About a Boy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Grandview, U.S.A.

i don't know what to do i'm and every week from pm on friday until am on saturday i babysit this crazy child he just turned five he has no sibilings or anything and gets his way all the time i think he may have autism or adhd or something but there is no way of telling until he is in school his mom is really nice but she doesn't believe in time outs or anything i don't exactly know what to do i want to keep the job but everything i've tried fails he runs around screaming he cried when he couldn't get his shoe on then cried when his mom helped him he punches and kicks people and kicks people for no reason also he will never go to sleep i need help thanks everybody i know you are all right about this the thing is the mom is really nice and i feel sorry for her because she is a single parent doesn't have enough money to afford a real day care service and has to work all the time also even if she did have enough money for one she lives no where near one thanks for your advice though this is what i would do i have been babysitting for a really long time and never really had a problem with the kids what you can do is plan crafts and stuff for you two to do together because his mom is single and he doesnt have his dad around he is probably wanting attention so you can buy construction paper glue glitter scissors etc anything that you think a year old would like it really isnt that expensive it will probably cost like dollars max then when you get there tell him you have a surprise and if he is good he will get to see what it is kids around his age love to do projects i babysit for a six year old and a four year old and i always find stuff i can make for them for example you can do projects centered around the holidays or make things that he can give to his mom like puppets out of lunch paper bags or animals out of paper plates it will keep him occuppied and happy another thing that kids love doing is building forts this is sooooooooo easy all you need is kitchen chairs and a blanket then pop in a movie make some popcorn and chill when he goes crazy on you and kicks and screams take a deep breath and just relax tell him you cant help him if he is acting crazy ask him to use his words so that you can solve the problem dont let him see that you are getting frustrated because he will feed off of that i have had trouble getting kids to bed and this is probably one of the hardest things a babysitter has to do because will come up with the most randomest things so they wont have to sleep you have to think of everything ahead of time before he goes to bed make sure he has went to the bathroom brushed his teeth has water by his bed then you can read him a book and sit with him for a while only if he closes his eyes and tries to sleep but if he starts playing around that you are going to leave another thing that you can do is play a lot with him during the day so when it is time for bed he is super tired  Shaggy dog story The Fairly OddParents EastEnders Calvin and Hobbes Avenue Q About a Boy Humphrey Bogart The Catcher in the Rye Tag The Marshall Mathers LP Garfield The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Theory of conduct The Inside Pitaten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kurt Cobain Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Grandview, U.S.A.

at what age can i use bumper pads in my daughters crib ok i know they are dangerous and should not be used under a year to prevent sids my daughter is now almost months what age did you put bumbers in your toddlers crib any sites that do not recommend using them even over a year you shouldn't use them once a baby can stand because they can be used to assist climbing out of the crib also there is more chance of an older child becoming entangled because they are more inquisitive basically they are useless http www hc sc gc ca cps spc legislation pol bumper bordure e html however when used correctly bumper pads should not protect infants from bumping against the sides of a crib or from having limbs become entrapped between the slats of the crib this is because bumper pads are supposed to be removed from the crib by the time that the infant is able to roll over and sit up unaided a development milestone normally reached between and months of age which represents the same time frame in which it is expected that the infant would be able to move over and approach the side of the crib it must also be noted that for the most part infants do not sustain major injuries from banging their heads against the sides of their cribs because they are incapable of generating enough force to seriously injure themselves through head banging the frontal bone which is the part of the head most frequently struck during crib head banging is the thickest bone in the body and therefore is capable of absorbing the shock associated with this type of behaviour it should also be noted that it remains possible for an infant to entrap his or her limbs over or under the bumper pads and that infant limb entrapment between the slats of a crib in the vast majority of cases results in no injury or minor injury such as bruising in summary aesthetic value the risk of limb entrapment and the risk of a child hitting their head against the side of their crib are overshadowed by the hazards of entanglement entrapment strangulation and suffocation potentially leading to death that children are exposed to through the use of bumper pads  Airbag Equine conformation Sudden infant death syndrome Cascading Style Sheets Cytomegalovirus Wound Diving Breastfeeding Breech birth Bleeding Abortion debate Glossary of climbing terms Spanking Crash test dummy School bus Fast bowling Cephalic disorder Urinary incontinence Fire fighting Mattress Hip fracture Cancer Aerial (dance move) Tooth enamel Volleyball Professional wrestling holds Traumatic brain injury Androgen insensitivity syndrome Decompression sickness Childbirth Pneumonia Bone marrow transplant Drowning Professional wrestling throws Medical analysis of circumcision Insurance Bruise Combine (Half-Life 2) Road safety Tobacco smoking Asbestos Penis HTML Infant baptism Tourniquet Chair Myocardial infarction Bicycle helmet Kimberly-Clark Corporation Bone fracture Seat belt legislation Boxing Empress L__ Zhi First aid Bodyline Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stroke AIDS Anorexia nervosa Seismic retrofit Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Milk High-voltage hazards Abortion Tocopherol Assassination Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Skull Tsunami Glossary of wildland fire terms Infantilism Growth hormone deficiency Sailing Race X James Bulger Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Tank Prostate cancer Star Wars: Galaxies Swimming Intracranial pressure BASE jumping Baby transport Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Infant Pinball Intersex surgery Avalanche HyperText Transfer Protocol Terminal ballistics Chevrolet Camaro Snakebite (bite) Survivors of the September 11, 2001 attacks Year 2000 problem Oasis (band)

my year old is driving me crazy by not listening i just asked her to clean up a mess she made by the table she threw some melon during breakfast she said no mommy you do it i again asked her to do it she just looked at me and refused to do it i put her in time out for awhile and then got her out and told her again to pick it up she refused so now she's back in time out i don't know what to do she needs to learn to clean up her messes when i ask her to i don't think this time out is even working any ideas discipline only works if the parent is more relentless than the child let this be your mantra i will not let a three year old boss me around throwing food is unacceptable and you are right not to tolerate it let the girl sit in her corner until she is ready to clean it up you gave her the three minute time out now the choice is hers she can chose to sit in a boring time out or she can chose to ask politely to clean up her mess then play if you make it very clear to her that those are her only two options she will eventually chose to clean up the melon if she wants to sulk in the corner for a little while first don't let it bother you take the time to do something quiet that makes you happy like read a book or magazine or eat a cookie you will be surprised at how quickly she will be a helpful respectful girl again stick with it because it's worth it  Shaggy dog story The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe St. Elmo's Fire (film) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Avenue Q The Amber Spyglass Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Singlish Time Out of Mind Cleveland Browns Garfield One Piece minor characters Grandview, U.S.A.

month old pulling out her hair my friend's month old daughter is pulling out her hair at night when she is sleeping she now has a bald spot on the side of her head because she only pulls it from that one area every night she has seen a doctor and he has ruled out any physical ailments to be the cause they also just took her to cut her hair in hopes that will help does anyone have any ideas on how to stop this behavior before it gets worse things already tried telling her pulling out her hair is a no no putting a hat on when she sleeps she just took it off cut her hair really short yes she for sure is pulling it out when they get up the hair is balled up in her hand i heard a story about a child who did something similar when he was weaned from the breast he would pull his hair out and rub it on his face after many specialists it was discovered that his mother had hairy nipples while this is probably not the case with your friend for some reason her daughter really likes to pull her hair out so much so that it is a self soothing method too bad she doesn't suck her thumb i would recommend giving her an alternate hair pulling option put a very fuzzy stuffed animal in bed with her and see how she does or even a barbie doll or something like it they could also try to teach her to pet her hair instead of pull on it as an extension of the 'touch nice' lesson failing all else i would recommend mittens or socks on her hands so she cannot get a good grip on her hair  Breastfeeding Sin City Salad Fingers Kodocha Avenue Q Dog Eric Cartman Baldness Textile manufacturing Aerial (dance move) EastEnders Hair Characters of The Sandman The Critic Ranma __ characters Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Cheating in poker Dog training Knots Landing Barbie Hormone replacement therapy (trans) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Garfield Cat The Shining (film) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The Subtle Knife The Addams Family Little Britain Humphrey Bogart W.I.T.C.H.

what is the ideal sleep schedule for a month old my month old daughter sleeps for about hours every day she sleeps at about pm am every night and wakes up at about am every morning then she sleeps again at about am and wakes up at about pm then she sleeps for about hour at about pm our pediatrician keeps saying that it varies from child to child but we have a feeling that it might be less for someone of her age our daughter weighs lb and she is not gaining much weight either she is a very active kid additionally we have a feeling that this sleep schedule might be contibuting to it as well any suggestion on her sleep schedule as well as ways to gain some weight might be helpful my month old has been on a regular sleep schedule since he was about or months old i followed the plan in the book babywise and have been so pleased though i know all babies are different and some may just not require as much sleep my little guy is a good sleeper he goes to bed at night around and wakes up around though i don't ever get him until he is just content to talk and play this is a good sign your child is well rested they should never wake up crying or fussy if they do that means they have not slept enough and you should not consider the nap over he does still take a morning nap if we are home he has cut it down to about an hour between or his afternoon nap is from about or if he has missed his morning nap it may last until sometimes i know it sounds crazy but i have found it to be true every time the earlier they go to bed at night the longer and better they sleep plus the better they are at napping sleep breeds sleep don't worry about the weight from the weight chart my doctor gave me a lb month old is close to the th percentile which is not of concern my month old weighs about pounds he just went through a big growth spurt before months and then totally reversed and i couldn't get him to eat a quarter of what he was eating before i think with him it is teething issues that can disrupt eating and sleeping for quite awhile also babies grow more when they sleep than when they are awake so the two are connected i would suggest working on getting your little one to bed much earlier and i would guess that would help immensely on her sleeping habits my little one stayed up until after two nights in a row last week but still woke at the same time in the morning was extra cranky and had a hard time getting back into nap mode it will take you awhile to adjust the schedule but stick with it and you will be fine you should strive for at least hours of sleep at night there will i'm sure be crying at first but after about days of sticking to your guns your little one will catch on good luck  Sleep Insomnia Daylight saving time Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Urinary incontinence Siesta Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Mattress Narcolepsy Apollo 8 Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bodybuilding Jon Secada Fertility awareness Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March The Shining (film) Avenue Q The Contender (television series) Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Ron and Fez Cat The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Good Morning, Vietnam Blonde on Blonde Spirit rover timeline for 2004 April Futurama (TV series - season 5) Ty Cobb Puberty Delayed sleep phase syndrome Lucid dreaming Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Social rule Attack on Pearl Harbor Adjustable gastric band Kodocha Oasis (band) Cliff Richard AFI 100 Years series Knots Landing House of M Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Slow Train Coming The Catcher in the Rye Guinea pig Phoebe Buffay's songs Grandview, U.S.A.

my yr will pee on the toilet but refuses to poop it has been mos how do i get her to poop on the potty she has been peeing on the toilet for the longest time we don't put her in diapers anymore we use pull ups for long road trips and at night during naps and during the day she wears underwear she can get on the toilet all by herself and wipe and flush she can pull her own panties down and everything but she refuses to poop on the potty we have tried all we know including punishment from toys tv books everything she will only poop on the toilet very occasionally in the almost year she has been trained she has pooped on the toilet maybe times it is really frustrating and we just would like to know how to change it i don't like to spank my child and we even tried that a couple times i felt terrible and felt it wasn't the right way to do it this was recently so it wasn't like the spanking made her not want to do it also it wasn't even a hard spanking it was a pat on the bottom we were told that had worked for some kids but not for us i am years old and have been working at a childcare center since i was i also have brothers and a sister ages and im also in my third year of school for a degree in early childhood ed pooping on the potty is one of the hardest things to get a child to do i was currently given a head teaching job at the daycare i work at for a group of year olds years old is when the children begin pre school however one of the requirements for leaving the toddler group is to be potty trained there is a little girl who has been going pp on the potty since she was litterally she turned two and her parents tried potty training and it worked she did great but she still wont poop on the potty my brothers never pooped on the potty either he would wait until somebody put a diaper on him my mom didnt rush him and in time he did it on his own in most cases this is normal i dont know if children feel embarased my brother used to hide in the corner when he'd poop one thing is that punishment usually doesnt work all children grow and develope at different speeds and your three year old is simply not ready for this task she will be though dont worry too much also taking away toys and tv espically books you shouldnt take books away from a child punishment can turn the whole expierence into a bad one which could possibly make the process even longer please know that i'm not repremanding you at all or trying to teach you how to raise your children in most cases taking away toys or tv would probably be effective these are some things you can try reward for going potty even just pee at my work when a child goes on the toilet they get a sticker one mother had a great idea which was a 'treasure box' she filled a box with lots of goodies fruit snack packs big stickers like at the doctors office mini packs of m m's little bracelets and rings and whenever her daughter went pee pee on the potty she would let her pick a prize from the treasure box i know it sounds like a bribe but its actually positive reinforcement but perhaps you can pick out a bigger toy than whats in the treasure box something not too big maybe just a barbie or a doll and tell her that when she goes poop on the potty she gets the big prize you can also get so many books and videos dvd's about it if you go to your local library into the childrens section tell the librarian that your having trouble potty training you dont have to get into details and that you were wondering if they had any books or movies for kids she should direct you to where they are good luck  Toilet humour Rugrats Pitaten Parenting Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infantilism Kimberly-Clark Corporation Kimi Finster Kodocha Humphrey Bogart The Inside The Fairly OddParents Diaper Spanking EastEnders The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Urinary incontinence Poker jargon Social rule The Adventures of Pete & Pete Professional wrestling match types Doug Toilet training Atomic Kitten Jackass: The Movie Shaggy dog story The Family from One End Street Futurama (TV series - season 2) Housebreaking Fecal incontinence Baby Blues Toilet The Contender (television series) The Star Wars Holiday Special Japanese toilet Calvin and Hobbes One Piece minor characters Great Teacher Onizuka SpongeBob SquarePants Sin City Ranma __ characters The Sims Rocko's Modern Life Milton H.

i have a year old son who is kind of shy how can i do to change that fact you cant change his personality but there are a few things that can help socialise him introducing him to other playmates his age and perhaps sending him to preschool or a centre that offers activities for young children like gymnastics or art this will help him get used to socialising with children also because this is what i found as a child my parents because i was quiet would often talk for me and i ended up getting too used to this try to give your child as many opportunies to speak for himself and maybe if he has trouble start him off and give him prompts but encourage him and praise him when he expresses himself even at home make it okay to be quiet but at the same time gently encourage him to meet other children and express himself through words even if he remains shy the rest of his life if has adequate conversational and social skills then he will be able to cope  Education in the People's Republic of China Social rule Autism Property (ownership right) Kodocha Education in the United States Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Aesthetic Realism Education in Taiwan Alcoholics Anonymous Rudolf Steiner Sant Thakar Singh A Course In Miracles Dyslexia Jiddu Krishnamurti Hillary Rodham Clinton Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Traumatic incident reduction Baby Blues Humphrey Bogart Adoption Kender Montessori method Playmate Transactional analysis Homeschooling Autism rights movement Breastfeeding Socialization Past teachings of Prem Rawat Jacob Child sexual abuse Ludwig Wittgenstein Religious Society of Friends The Human Stain Grief Hikikomori Religious conversion Suzuki method Franklin (television series) Latin Early childhood education Percy Bysshe Shelley Yelena Davydova Mental retardation Hearing impairment Lou Gehrig Scenes from a Memory My Parents are Aliens Playboy (magazine) Milton H.

any ideas on how to stop toddlers from playing with feces i have twin year old daughters who are currently potty training some days when i put them down for their nap we have no problems however there are the days that i walk into their room after they wake up and find them diaper less and the carpet and walls smeared with poop i am at my wits end on how to deal with this my sons nieces and nephews never did anything of this sort so i have no previous experience in dealing with this kind of behavior for some reason my daughters don't seem to use their poop for paint when they wake up in the morning only after their nap i have twin year old daughters who are currently potty training some days when i put them down for their nap we have no problems however there are the days that i walk into their room after they wake up and find them diaper less and the carpet and walls smeared with poop i am at my wits end on how to deal with this my sons nieces and nephews never did anything of this sort so i have no previous experience in dealing with this kind of behavior for some reason my daughters don't seem to use their poop for paint when they wake up in the morning only after their nap i have tried ignoring it and just cleaning up the mess but they just did it more often i taped their diapers on but they just ripped the diapers making a bigger mess i taped shorts on over their diapers but they figured out how to get the tape off i tried telling them what it is and how disgusting it is but that hasn't seemed to help either i tried making them help clean up the mess but they made it worse i have tried ignoring it and just cleaning up the mess but they just did it more often i taped their diapers on but they just ripped the diapers making a bigger mess i taped shorts on over their diapers but they figured out how to get the tape off i tried telling them what it is and how disgusting it is but that hasn't seemed to help either i tried making them help clean up the mess but they made it worse boredom none of my children acted out in this way playing with poop but they did in other ways messier ways lol but easier to control i suppose for example baby powder all over the entire room vasoline everywhere including in the hair lol you need to try and emphasize that for one poop is disgusting to play with you need to tell it like it is poop is waste from our bodies just like garbage is waste from our family no one plays with the garbage do they no so then its not okay to play in poop yuck you also might want to highlight how bad poop smells and that when they get it on them because they are playing in it they smell that way too also try to not have a huge reaction when you walk in and see this like i said boredom they will enjoy your reaction so you need to hav a reaction it just needs to be the right one an action and disposition of disgust disappointment and love for your children would probably work best in this situation tell them that you are disappointed that instead of doing 'something else' that they enjoy craft going to park watching a tv show you all need to spend that time now cleaning up a big poopy mess it isn't funny or cute its gross and a lot of work that they are capable of helping you clean up which they definatly should do if anything hand them each a wet cloth and have them wipe down the walls children aren't born knowing whats right and wrong and why its our job as parents to teach them while loving them to bits don't scold them for it just teach them why this behavior is not acceptable and why it is disrespectful to themselves to you the entire family daddy other siblings and to their room and things this won't be a miracle and work after one time but eventually maybe a couple times they will get it hang in there till they do also as a preventative measure you may want to try timing there naps if you know that they usually sleep for about hour then go in at about mins and start puttering around putting laundry away tidying up etc this way you are already in the room and ready to start the second part of the day with them when they are ready its all about boredom kids get into the most trouble when they are bored p and you've got teammates on your hands lol  Social rule Infantilism Diaper EastEnders Friends Sin City Pitaten Theory of conduct Kimi Finster Toilet humour Milton H.

response to my carseat law question whats with the haters i asked this question last night and i was suprised by people saying i was just jealous of her and wanted to get her in trouble etc i mentioned the fact that she is rich and has a bmw and fake boobs because i thought people would say maybe she cannot afford a carseat some people on here are just haters and her daughter is the same age as mine and is shorter than my daughter both thin as rails so to the person who said that pa was height and weight requirements as well as age read up http answers yahoo com question index ylt aglyi w lenppx wp zsy ix qid aait eu i am sooo glad that there are more people like me out there i wasn't sure that there was i'm am a huge car seat fan i hate to see kids not buckled in in front seat or not buckled in their car seats right you'd be surprised how many people don't know how to buckle their kids in right but are afraid to ask just ask people it could be your kids life that you're saving i could go on all night i will tell you though definitely turn her in i've said something to a stranger before about the fact that their child wasn't properly restrained it was hard to do but i felt much better after knowing that the child would be a little safer i wish they made parents take a car seat class because there's a lot for people to learn i've called someone in driving down the road before so you go girl don't ever be afraid to turn someone in know that you're probably saving that child's life  One Tree Hill (TV series) The Human Stain EastEnders Shaggy dog story About a Boy 24 Hours of Le Mans Piccolo Junior Saga Theory of conduct Survivor (novel) Charmed Eddie Guerrero Car safety The Contender (television series) Sharon Tate Knots Landing The Ashlee Simpson Show Motorcycle Iron Maiden George Costanza Boston Public Kyle Broflovski Year of the Spider Paul Is Dead Seat belt Fight Club Sin City The Adventures of Pete & Pete Transactional analysis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Radiohead American Psycho The Marshall Mathers LP The Apprentice 2 Time Out of Mind The Subtle Knife The Catcher in the Rye Spanish verbs The Dukes of Hazzard The Emancipation of Mimi Humphrey Bogart Ty Cobb Car handling Tire Wolfrider School bus Rent (musical) Night (book) Mazda RX-7 Sport utility vehicle Avenue Q Social rule Kurt Cobain The Death Gate Cycle The Fairly OddParents Good Times Characters in the Smurfs Plame affair Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Milton H.

question about child a d d i have a very very very active yr old he's been that way since he was about now i've notice that he can't sit still or keep quiet for like more than seconds its getting on my ever lasting nerve no matter how i discipline him or try to get him to stop moving he can't he fidgets all the time he either has to be moving or making noise and any and all noise i think he has a add because he serious lacks any and all focus but when i asked my doctor she of course said he was way to young to be diagnosed so my question is for moms who thought there child had add and then was told by doctors they didn't what age the hyperness goes away and to moms of kids w add did you have a feeling that your child had it before he she was old enough to be diagnosed hey tha g child go fuck yourself i don't my child to have problems in school and not get a proper education and become some jackass that mooches off of society like you p s i don't want to put him on drugs i have a niece that had it and her mom drug the hell out her and i don't want to do that w my kid i have had two of my children diagnosed with a d d and yes they were definitely different from my other were tha g child is an idiot who doesn't know what the hell he's talking about and probably doesn't have any kids at all my other children loved to sit and have me read stories to them at like yrs old the with a d d were just like you described yours i can tell you that discipline is a waste because they cannot control these actions tough it out until he gets into school and then ask to see a specialist because it is not fair to the child to try to make them adapt to such a structured environment when it is impossible for them to do so and i wouldn't wait until he was my son was on meds for year then told me that once he realized how things were supposed to be he didn't need the meds anymore i took him off of them and he's doing fine this was yrs ago my daughter however still needs them for school and she is a junior in high school she doesn't take them on summer break though i agree that these meds can be way over prescribed but when it effects the child's learning something has to be done i hope everything works out for you  Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Shaggy dog story Kodocha The Marshall Mathers LP Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Piccolo Junior Saga The Amber Spyglass Ben Johnson (athlete) Humphrey Bogart Milton H.

my daughter has a phobia of spiders need help my year old within in the last mos has become extemely phobic or spiders she hyperventilates screams cries shakes at the site of a spider there was no incidence that has caused this and no one that i know is scared of spiders i'm not sure why this is happening but could use some advice from anyone who wants to help thanks when i was young i was afraid of spiders i think that was largely because of my mother's fears i had a bigger problem with daddy long legs harvestmen which are not true spiders when i lived in georgia for two years nevertheless i overcame my fear of spiders and harvestmen by learning more about them how beneficial they are etc indeed i began to develop a fascination for them i caught a wolf spider as a teen one summer and kept it for awhile when i entered college i bought my first tarantula it was a beautiful pink toe sadly it died so i bought different one a zebra leg it died too i now own a beautiful rose hair and i've had it since i bet you didn't know that tarantulas can live that long anyway i understand your daughter's reaction toward spiders but i advise you strongly not to reinforce her emotion by injecting your own fears and dislikes you'll only make the situation worse don't kill spiders either use every occasion when you encounter a spider as a teaching experience educate her about the many different species of spiders go to the library and check out some books about spiders visit the pet store and look at the tarantulas when you find a spider in your home capture it and release it outside some event precipitated your daughter's attitude toward spiders it might have been a family member or another relative or friend who reacted negatively she may have encountered one in an unguarded moment and it frightened her so severely that she now reacts the way she does nevertheless i think it's important that you uncover the root cause of her fear and educate her so that she overcomes it there are only two species of spiders in the united states that you should really worry about one is the black widow but if you keep a clean house you shouldn't have to trouble about it all because it's a cobweb weaver and it prefers undisturbed locations most often outside the other is the brown recluse and it's largely found in the southern midwest and southeastern united states if you don't live in these areas then there is little to fear from recluses you may want to consider buying a tarantula i know that seems counterintuitive given your daughter's present feeling towards spiders but it may in fact help her overcome her fear of them i've let spiders crawl on me without reservation including my tarantulas it tickles tarantulas have tiny little claws in their feet that they use to grip onto surfaces as they climb them she could watch you feed the tarantula too i especially loved watching my pink toe eat i'd add some crickets to her glass aquarium then she'd climb down from her perch pink toes are arboreal and hang within an inch or two of the ground cover and snatch the crickets as they hopped around the perimeter of the tank it was amazing to see her feed because she was lightning fast and she converted a mass of crickets to a bolus in short order if you're lucky and you take good care of your tarantula you might even see it molt while i've not actually watched my spider molt i've found her shedding later it was so cool to examine the fangs in particular closely i overcame my fear of spiders through immersion that is i learned a lot about the various species and i developed an understanding of how they benefit humankind i suspect that if you truly educate your daughter about spiders she can do the same here's a link you might find useful for your own edification http science howstuffworks com spider htm  The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Shaggy dog story Minor Harry Potter Beasts Anxiety Fast bowling Ranma __ characters Dragon Booster Darth Vader RuneScape quests Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Moult Blood (computer game) Garfield Dog Diving Brown recluse spider Spider-Man Doom enemies Milton H.

is it okay to let a years old boy to try to masturbate a years old boy is trying to masturbate while watching a cartoon for example and he can do this when he is with others i would like to know if it is the age or what ever reason there can be to let him behave this way you should not reprimand him at all it is perfectly normal just tell him that it is something done in private to him it is not sexual this answer was posted on the parenting magazine website about a young girl age i think who was mastubating the doctor gave this answer your daughter has discovered what is pleasurable and makes her feel good just as she's exploring the feelings and workings of other parts of her body she's also appreciating the feelings that touching her genitals give her this is a normal stage of body discovery and does not mean that your child has an underlying psychological problem like all pleasurable activity however genital play can become emotionally and physically harmful from a physical standpoint excessive rubbing can result in urinary tract infections especially in girls due to the shortness of the urethra the urinary opening between the bladder and the vagina if the genital play becomes so frequent and intense that the child withdraws from other normal childhood activities and interactions as your child seems to be doing it's wise to intervene try these techniques distract and substitute get her attention and substitute a more attractive activity such as an outing to the park a movie or some playtime together continue to keep her occupied with social activities by inviting friends over and arranging for her to go to their homes too be sure the children are supervised when they play together in her room keep an open door policy so that you can intervene when she begins genital massage while her friends are visiting give alternative tension releasers you may be right that she's using genital massage as a tension reliever when she begins touching herself take it as clue that she needs soothing offer to give her a back rub while you play a calming song whatever techniques you employ be sure to encourage your child to appreciate how marvelously designed her body is you don't her to grow up believing certain body parts are bad or that it's wrong to touch them as she matures her preoccupation with her private parts will subside within a couple years she'll be too aware of appropriate behavior to keep fondling her genitals in public  Urinary incontinence Masturbation Infantilism Human sexual behavior Prostate cancer Penis Female genital cutting Intersex surgery Strap-on dildo Massage Child sexual abuse Childlove movement Domestic violence Narcissism Autism Circumcision Drug addiction Milton H.

any rememdies to stop the runs i am an experienced mum but i have never known a year old have the runs the way my daughter has now she is not in any particular pain so i suspect a tummy upset but the poor thing is exhausted she is not able to make it to the toilet so that is adding to her problem she is very embarrassed and putting her back in nappies would be unfair to her i would usually let the runs pass through but these are nothing i have experienced before we have used pairs of knickers no sooner are they washed and dried they are soiled and back in the machine and thats not including the towels and bedding that have also been washed my man is away so anything suggested has got to be bought from the near by shop and no medicines please she is only years old thank you in advance for any remedies she is exhausted because she has been up all night she is certainly not dehydrated and be assured she is drinking sips of water its a tummy upset for that i am sure and as an experienced mother i would take her to the doctors if it continued past hrs poor wee thing well you sound like you know what your doing but the way i see it is if she has caught a wee bug then having the runs is flushing out her system so just keep with the sips of water cool boiled water is best as you no i wouldnt bother to much about food as long as she is drinking if anything try something light like toast or scrambled egg pairs of knickers is a lot to go through sounds like she has it bad erm i would get the doctor in at the hour mark to the house dont take her out to him poor wee thing is going through enough i agree with not putting nappys on her she might feel she is doing something wrong or is being a baby kids minds dont think the same as us you could try the pull up pants they have wee pictures on them might make her feel special or a potty next to her all the time hope she gets better soon  Sento Social rule Urinary incontinence Tea Poker jargon Breastfeeding Japanese toilet Fecal incontinence Milton H.

what age did you potty train your toddler how did you do it mostly for a girl one of my sons potty trained himself before he was two he's three now and it was nice to not have to buy pull ups anymore his older brother was at least three before we could get him out of pull ups i don't have a lot of advice in getting girls out of diapers other than the basics of don't make it a bad thing a lot of parents scold their toddlers for accidents or for not using the toilet that tends to make it worse instead of better praise her when she does use the potty or get through a night without wetting her pull up but keep in mind if she's still not getting through the night without a wet diaper she is not ready yet that's the first thing to look for when potty training  Kimberly-Clark Corporation Rugrats Elimination communication Diaper Toilet training Infantilism Urinary incontinence Parenting The Fairly OddParents Humphrey Bogart Fecal incontinence Bedwetting The Sims 2 The Girl Who Slept Too Little One Tree Hill (TV series) Future-Drama The Isley Brothers Avenue Q On A Clear Day I Can't See My Sister Social rule Captain Underpants Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Miss Saigon Genericized trademark EastEnders Toilet humour The Sims The Contender (television series) Shaggy dog story The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Feral child Toilet paper Theory of conduct 50 First Dates Puni Puni Poemy The Chemical Brothers Housebreaking Masturbation Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Time Out of Mind Toilet Conker's Bad Fur Day Japanese toilet YuYu Hakusho Ranma __ characters Ranma Saotome Cruising (maritime) Recess (TV series) FoxTrot The Catcher in the Rye Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Mad Money Kimi Finster Joy (novel) Dog training Married... with Children Milton H.

parents please respond if you've had this problem too i just want to know how worried should i be and if any other parents out there have this problem and did it change what did you do to change the problem my son just turned years old and will only go to the potty if you tell him too but won't pee or boo boo on his own i tried putting little boy underwear on him but he would just go right in them he can sing one of his cartoon theme songs word for word and has an excellent memory but speaks like this can i have some juice instead he says mommy juicy i want to watch shrek instead he says shrek mommy yes i read to him and have been trying to potty train him for almost a year now he also knows all his numbers colors and can read recognize some smaller words cat mommy daddy his name dog hat etc i would appreciate any helpful suggestions please keep sarcasm to yourself thanks he used to not even want to feed himself at all or eat things that are too hard his doctor suggest to me to take him to a therapist to help him with this problem i just decided to keep working with him instead and now he feeds himself just fine and eats some hard things i think he was afraid of choking but i've taught him to chew his foods for a while before swallowing i'm not against therapy at all but i would rather try to help my son accomplish these hurdles myself first before giving up on him i think it is a year old thing my daughter did it when she was and now my son is doing it too instead of asking for a snack he will say nacky a drink is rinky and so on i know he knows how to say things properly because he does it all the time at grandma and grandpa's house i too read to my children and we play word games all the time on long car rides so it is not from a lack of trying either just let it run it's course and occasionally remind him what the proper way is but don't force it my daughter lost intrest in the baby talk around to years old i am sure my son will do the same expecially once he starts his play group in the fall and is around other kids his age more as for the potty training just keep reminding him and he will get it with time my son was a pain in the hind end to train then it seemed like all of a sudden one day it clicked in his brain and he has been going every since good luck  Milton H.

my son wont talk my month old has issues with speaking and i am need advice he is months old and rarely says anything he only says word at a time like mama dada ball he wont put words together and i think its time he needs to form senteneces i have sessions with him everyday for hours i make him sit and i make him repeat words that i sa and if he dont we sit til he does after the sessions he just runs around and plays and dont even pa attention to what i said he acts like he didnt even learn anyhting im woundering if he is going to have learning issues in school like maybe be in the slow learning class i dont want that my gosh how can i helkp him more whoa jessica take it easy here i am a teacher and in studying to be a teacher i had to learn a lot about child development every child is different plus you have a boy most of the time they are slower than girls in this area making a child that is this young sit for three hours while you are forcing words down his throat is completely useless and abusive of course he just runs around and plays afterwards he's too little to comprehend what you are even doing to him any child would need to run around and play after being forced to sit for that long at that age give him time many times children don't really start to talk until after years old there is not certain age that a child must talk by an example my aunt didn't speak until she was almost seven years old now she is highly successful and the top human resources manager for a huge insurance company even einstein didn't talk until he was and look how he turned out someone above mentioned autism and they are right about that i wouldn't worry too much but if it is autism what you are doing will never work with an autistic child if you are really concerned and he is still not talking more by the time he turns in months then talk to his pediatrician he or she may do some testing or recommend you to a specialist if they are concerned of course it is okay to teach him words here and there show him things and repeat what they are called but not for hour stretches i teach th grade and we don't even let students sit for that long because even at and years old they are not capable of concentrating for that long give your child and yourself a break let him be a toddler forcing him to do otherwise could really do damage and actually cause a problem when there was never one to begin with p s the best thing you can do for your son is you want to help him is to read to him every single day for to minutes this will help with everything his reading abilities his communication skills etc trust me on this as a teacher read read read  Autism Autism rights movement Asperger syndrome Education Ethical challenges to autism treatment Education in the United States Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Gifted Controversies in autism Education in Romania Autism epidemic Graduate school Propaedeutic value of Esperanto IBM PC compatible Education in the People's Republic of China Milton H.

what age should i start potty training my daughter i have a mo old daughter and i was wondering if it is too early to start potty training we just had a baby boy and the sooner she is out of diapers the better for the past months whenever i give her a bath i put her on her potty and let her go while i am feeling up the bathtub then i make a big deal out of the fact that she has gone she can barely talk right now and i dont know if she even knows when she has to go potty should i wait if it is time to go ahead and start how do you start thanks from a first time mom well i think they say certain requirements such as these signs include staying dry for at least hours at a time having regular bowel movements being able to follow simple instructions being uncomfortable with dirty diapers and wanting them to be changed asking to use the potty chair or asking to wear regular underwear you should also be able to tell when your child is about to urinate or have a bowel movement by his facial expressions posture or by what he says in my opinion you give it a try and stay calm with accidents and if she isn't showing interest or acting like she is getting it try again later  Diaper Kimberly-Clark Corporation Elimination communication Fecal incontinence Urinary incontinence Toilet training Toilet humour Infantilism Housebreaking Social rule Japanese toilet Sento Undergarment The Amazing Race Rugrats Prostate cancer SpongeBob SquarePants Milton H.

is it bad that my two year old toddler boy dresses in girl clothes when playing dramatic play my boyfriend freaks out when our year old son dresses in girls clothes and puts on makeup with his sisters he gets angry and wants to punish him he says that he will grow to be a fag and allowing him to freely play this way only teaches him to be feminine i disagree and feel that many young children do this and it shouldn't be an issue it breaks my heart that my boyfriend would think this way what would someone who has experience in early childhood development say to this it's perfectly normal behavior kids need to try out all sorts of roles when he gets to preschool he'll probably move on to dressing up in more traditional boys things your boyfriend can do real damage by making him feel guilty what you can do is to offer him some more choices the girls would benefit too add some uniform pieces some pieces of fabric and lots of job related hats i hope your boyfriend doesn't get upset when one of the girls decides to dress up as a firefighter and by the way how a year old dresses has nothing to do with his sexual identity and anyhow why does it matter  Characters in the Smurfs Friends Pitaten Gender role Cross-dressing Avenue Q Teen Girl Squad EastEnders Theory of conduct Daria Child sexuality Clothing Narcissism Women in Islam Infantilism Recurring South Park characters Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Adolescence Little Britain Transsexuality Knots Landing Phoebe Halliwell Hunter __ Hunter Child Boston Public Great Teacher Onizuka Revolutionary Girl Utena Kimberly-Clark Corporation The Apprentice 2 Pedophilia Urusei Yatsura The Devil Wears Prada Sex and the City Homosexuality Vernon Schillinger Sexual orientation Ashlee Simpson Kodocha Jennifer Lopez Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Ranma __ characters About a Boy French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools The Brady Bunch Everwood W.I.T.C.H.

year old comes into parents bed every night my and a half year old has been sleeping in his own bed for almost a year he has always woken up at least once during the night but up until recently i could put him back and he would go back to sleep within a few minutes however four months ago we moved house and since then he wants to sleep in our bed he will however go to sleep in his own bed at bedtime but comes into our bed during the early hours if i try to put him back in his bed we end up having a tug of war with him screaming and trying to climb out of the bed and he gets very upset about it if i do manage to get him back to sleep in his bed he will often wake up again an hour or so later and i have the same problem again and again sometimes he wakes up or times a night i used to lay down with him at bedtime and thought that maybe this was the problem so stopped doing this weeks ago but it hasn't helped at bedtime i now sit at the foot of his bed until he falls asleep and he is ok with this thanks sharon when this first started happening i was happy for him to snuggle up with us in our bed but he wriggles so much i dont get much sleep and after months i am exhausted my hubby usually ends up sleeping in my son's bed and my son ends up sleeping with me he wont sleep with daddy so maybe it is a bit of separation anxiety i know that this is wrong but at am i am too tired to keep taking him back over and over again he does sleep really well if it is just the two of us in our bed so i am thinking that like you it is better not to pick sleep battles at this time hubby however is not too happy to be sleeping in a single bed every night i could have written a portion of your question myself our year old has always had problems sleeping since the day we brought him home we no longer pick sleep battles since we all need sleep and have to get up early everynight he wanders into our bed and snuggles up against one of us then my husband would carry him back to his bed and lay down with him sometimes he fell asleep and stayed there overnight it's a queen sized bed so there is room for now it works for us because we all get sleep we have tried various methods of laying down slipping out of the room putting him back into his own bed times a night it's a hassle but the reality is that for now my son sleeps through the night when he shares a bed with either me or hubby it works for our family so that is all that matters so all i can offer to you is perhaps allow your son to get some comfort in your room that doesn't have to be in your bed though maybe an air mattress or foam pad at the foot of your bed or even a comforter on the floor for his special place is comfort enough it sounds like the recent move might have been scary and this is his only way to cope with change good luck to you  Sleep Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Daylight saving time Social rule The Amber Spyglass The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Shining (film) Insomnia Out-of-body experience EastEnders Sleeping Murder 2000 Australian Grand Prix Milton H.

should i let my daughter give away her favorite toys i have taught my daughter two things that i think are important that she is fortunate to have things that she desires in addition to the things she needs and to give to others less fortunate this in addition to not wanting my house over run with toys i have a toys at a time limit has led us to pack boxes to take to needy children every once in a while and she gets to choose which toys go but what if she chooses toys that are really sentimental to me and used to be sentimental to her should i let her part with those things or is it a concept taken overboard when her most prized stuffed animals are given away i would love to know what you think i think at this point that it probably depends on how old she is if she is years old and intends to give away something that you think she will later regret you could stash it away until a later date and ask her to decide again explaining that you thought she might change her mind on the other hand if she is a little older and embraces the concept of providing for underprivileged children for you to keep what she chose to give away would be to undermine her decisions you seem to be raising a thoughtful compassionate child good job mom  Predestination Calvin and Hobbes Extreme Programming The nature of God in Western theology Kodocha Free will Supply and demand Israel ben Eliezer Theory of conduct Microeconomics Kevin and Kell Infantilism Summa Theologiae EastEnders Meaning of life Love The Sims W.

how do you keep a crib sheet on the mattress when the child keeps pulling it off my month old pulls her crib sheet off just about every time she is in the crib then she gets upset and doesn't want to sleep right on the mattress but will when she gets tired any suggestions thank you they make elastic straps for just this thing you can usually find them at linens and things and bed bath and beyond or stores like that if you cannot find them make them yourself and attach them with velcro another possibility is to put a second sheet on the bottom side of the mattress so that the sides overlap that might make it harder for her to get it off if your sheets are older they may not be designed to fit the newer thicker mattresses maybe she is ready for a bed with a rail  Mattress Sudden infant death syndrome Strap-on dildo Bed (furniture) Vacuum mattress Undergarment Textile manufacturing Cryptanalysis of the Enigma Shoe Berth Cascading Style Sheets Casualty lifting Brewery Flax Coir Textile manufacturing terminology De Lorean DMC-12 Drill bit Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) M16 (rifle) Pickup truck Bedbug Velcro Basic English Changeroom Paper size Plastic Windows XP Futon View camera Tent Tire Bicycle frame Urinary incontinence Carol Burnett Massage The Fairly OddParents Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Passenger car Equine conformation Avenue Q Social rule Waterbed Glossary of nautical terms Necktie The Critic Linen Archery Ultra Gemini 9A M4 Carbine Krag-J__rgensen Bombe Elastic Seismic retrofit Fecal incontinence Straw-bale construction Apollo Command/Service Module Floppy disk Mechanical advantage Knitting Boom (sailing) Professional wrestling match types Little Girl Lost (The Twilight Zone) SpongeBob SquarePants USS William B.

my father has diverticulosis what would be the best diet for him your diet does have an impact on your diverticulosis let me begin by briefly explaining what diverticulosis is and what the difference is between this and diverticulitis your colon is the final part of your digestive tract where your stool forms for elimination as a person ages pressure within the colon causes bulging pockets of tissue sacs that push out from the colon walls a small bulging sac pushing outward from the colon wall is called a diverticulum more than one bulging sac is referred to as diverticula diverticula can occur throughout the colon but are most common near the end of the left colon which is called the sigmoid colon the condition of having these diverticula in the colon is called diverticulosis it is possible to have diverticulosis and not know many people only find out that they have it when one or more of the pouches becomes inflamed or infected a condition called diverticulitis once the inflammation or infection has been treated the condition is back to being diverticulosis while the medical and dietary treatments are different for each of these conditions you may be able to prevent the pouches from becoming inflamed or infected diverticulitis you asked what foods you should avoid eating and the answer lies in what foods you should be eating the dietary treatment for diverticulosis is also one of the primary ways to prevent it a high fiber diet a low fiber diet is linked to causing diverticulosis and also linked to the onset of diverticulitis your goal will be to cut back on the low fiber foods and increase the high fiber ones the first thing to do is find out how many grams of fiber per day you need to consume the dietary reference intake for fiber is males to years old grams day males to years old grams day males years old grams day females to years old grams day females to years old grams day females plus years old grams day high fiber foods are the ones with whole wheat oat bran whole grain cereal vegetables fruit and legumes incorporate these into your diet by replacing your white bread rice and pasta with whole wheat ones having at least two meals a week where you have legumes in place of meat legumes include beans including soy beans peas and lentils consuming cereal with more than five grams of fiber per serving eating fruit with the seeds and or skin having vegetables with your meals and snacks you can add vegetables to the foods that you are eating or have soup salad or cooked vegetables on the side increasing your fiber intake slowly and taking in enough fluids along with the high fiber foods go for water seltzer club soda and herbal teas it took time to develop preferences for the foods that you eat if these foods are not ones that you are used to eating give yourself time to get used to the taste your health is worth the effort thank you for your question  Stomach cancer Cereal Tofu Soybean Breakfast Dieting Omega-3 fatty acid Atkins Nutritional Approach Tooth Vitamin C Bread Japanese cuisine Ulcerative colitis Urinary incontinence Hypoglycemia Vegetarian nutrition Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Constipation Adjustable gastric band German cuisine Jewish cuisine Milk Food preservation MRE Meal Cancer Breastfeeding Food guide pyramid Cuisine of the Southern United States Guinea pig Passover Cuisine of the Philippines Kosher foods Cuisine of Denmark Bengali cuisine Pneumonia Bran Ramen Flour Korean cuisine Soul food Roman eating and drinking Gout Fancy rat Cuisine of Africa Bean Agriculture Common cold Starch Protein Vegetarian cuisine Soy protein Anemia Cuisine of Brazil Escherichia coli O157:H7 Cheese Peruvian cuisine Cuisine of Singapore Egg (food) Hemorrhoid Domesticated turkey Soup French cuisine Acne Kashrut Flowering plant Raw food diet Coronary heart disease Rice Zinc Obesity Healthy eating South Beach diet Domestic rabbit Irritable bowel syndrome Insulin Chinese cuisine Tomato Weight training Cuisine of Argentina Organic food

how would you know if your year old has adhd i think my daughter has it i don't know much about children but i do know a lot about neurological medications i'm not sure if she really does have adhd since yr old kids can't pay attention anyway but try not to give her medication if she does any alternative is better than medication since a lot of these meds cause more problems than adhd ever will also your daughter may not need meds but nearly all doctors will prescribe them anyway to protect themselves from malpractice suits if a doctor prescribes your daughter try not to go through with the medicine since it's a waste of time and money and probably won't help her here are some links to articles on add meds a lot have side effects of headaches seizures shortness of breath etc  Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Medicine Migraine Methylphenidate Epilepsy Adult attention-deficit disorder Traumatic brain injury Adderall Medical malpractice Malaria Psoriasis Folic acid Chronic fatigue syndrome Decompression sickness Neurofeedback Amphetamine Sleep apnea Physician Traditional Chinese medicine Hypoglycemia Childbirth Alternative medicine Autism epidemic Lamotrigine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pneumonia Antipsychotic Tourette syndrome Procrastination British Medical Journal Clomipramine Physical therapy Psychiatry Urinary incontinence Doctorate Publicly funded medicine Health insurance Diabetes mellitus Multiple chemical sensitivity Anxiety Sulfasalazine Hyperactivity Medical school General practitioner Terri Schiavo Multiple sclerosis Fecal incontinence Controversies in autism Quackery Medical cannabis Antidepressant Clinical depression John Edwards Charles Darwin's illness Chemical imbalance theory Growth hormone treatment Hippocratic Oath Master's degree Stomach cancer Mesothelioma Asperger syndrome New England Journal of Medicine Primidone Osteopathy Natural Hygiene Medical prescription Cluster headache Homeopathy Potassium bromide Drug addiction Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Adverse effect (medicine) Intracranial pressure Chiropractic Maprotiline Cephalic disorder Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Cephalexin Prostate cancer Topiramate Generation Rescue Aspartame Terri Schiavo timeline Pharmaceutical company Tocopherol Stroke Schizophrenia Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders Tai Chi Chuan Methamphetamine Cannabis (drug) American Medical Association Alcoholism Rosemary Kennedy Seizure Buprenorphine Phimosis Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bipolar disorder

how can people yell at their children i work at a daycare i volunteered there for years before i got hired when i had my th bday not long ago i sometimes see parents yell at their kids and i could never do it how do they i mean i may be in a room alone with screaming kids no they don't follow max capacity rules there but i somehow manage to calmly but firmly set the rules and settle the kids down they all obey me pretty well but screaming i never could spanking yelling any of that stuff is just horrible to me i'm so calm around the kids and i love each and every one of them and screaming just seems wrong does anybody agree with me by the way i'm due in december with a boy very excited that is really great and congrats it is different watching other children and raising your own child children are more comfortable with their family and most kids minus the ones who are terrified of their parents act worse for their parents than they do for other people some people think it is bad parenting and some of it is but it is a natural thing don't you remember giving your parents some trouble but that is just an explanation that doesn't mean it is ok to yell or spank or whatever we have all been raised differently and that affects our parenting whether for the good or the worse  Theory of conduct Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Spanking Calvin and Hobbes Miss Saigon Shaggy dog story The Inside Little Britain Codename: Kids Next Door The Jeffersons (South Park) Milton H.

potty training question my daughter has been potty training for about a month but just the last few days we have done somthing that is working great we are keeping her in panties all day long in and out of the house i keep taking her potty and sometimes she tells me she has to go but not often i think if i had a good month with her doing this she will be set but she is suppose to start preschool in two weeks the class she is in don't really potty train but they said they will try and work something out find out more tomorrow i think if they put her in the next class which i doubt they will do they will potty train her but if they keep her in the class she is suppose to be in they won't really make a point to go out of their way for her which they are saying they will try to do if i put her in preschool i will probably work evenings so i will potty train her in the morning afternoon preschool for hours days a week and daddy in the evening my question do you think she should start preschool in two weeks or give her that month and start her next semester or maybe earlier if they have an opening the days she is not in preschool i will be home with her all day my daughter is months and her class does not potty train the class the potty trains is months old but i have already started earlier and doing great annie i have always been big on not changing too many things at once and for some reason that slipped my mind i am almost sure we will wait even though we wasted some money i think what is best for her is more important thanks a bunch everyone don't give her too many things to handle at once some children don't take to preschool right away so the potty training will add to her anxiety i'd potty train her first then put her in preschool next semester when she feels she's a 'big' girl you sound really sensible are putting your daughter's interest first which is great for everyone  Social rule Dog training Education in the People's Republic of China Sydney Riot of 1879 Education in Germany Education in the United States Housebreaking The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Toilet humour Kindergarten Jon Secada Good Morning, Vietnam Slow Train Coming Soap opera Ben Johnson (athlete) Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The Fairly OddParents USS Yorktown (CV-10) Time Out of Mind Dorama EastEnders The Sims Charles Peace Jennifer Lopez James Hanratty USS Waters (DD-115) Avenue Q Friends Blonde on Blonde Full House USS Tunny (SS-282) Moe Berg Extreme Programming AFI 100 Years series 2000 Australian Grand Prix Shaggy dog story About a Boy Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March The Chemical Brothers The Critic Ravi Shastri Wheel of Fortune USS Ammen (DD-527) Rugrats The Citadel (Military College) Ocean's Twelve Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Elimination communication Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Craps Recess (TV series) Ron and Fez David Hume Sant Thakar Singh The Ashlee Simpson Show The nature of God in Western theology USS Ticonderoga (CV-14) Milton H.

what are your opinions on little girls wearing make up like a year old with real make up or the kid stuff do you find it disturbing occasionally i would allow a little girl to put on lip gloss for dress up but not on a regular basis a little one doesn't need makeup to enhance her beauty but they sometimes want to be like mommy and have a little gloss on their lips that would be all i would ever allow sunscreen for their tender skin and maybe some chapstick to prevent sunburned lips but nothing else is necessary they grow up fast enough and don't need to push it further  Cosmetics Sunscreen Sunburn Lip balm Puberty Lipstick Skateboarding trick Tattoo Sunlight The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy KaBlam!

what is going on with my year old she has been going to the bathroom in her pants she is fully potty traines but just these last couple days if you dont take her to the bethroom she will just go right in her pants shes never done this before i dropped her off with her dad today and he called me saying she went poop in her pants and pee like times i think it is because she is just excited to be around the other kids there and to busy playing she just doesnt care she hasnt been around too many kids this summer so does that sound like a reson she was soing that so much today she has only done it a couple times here at home if i dont take her to the bathroom on time she likes to be accomponied sp also she doesnt go over there much so maybe thats another reason excuse my spelling i was typing fast excuse my spelling i was typing fast this is going to sound strange but is there any chance her dad was allowing her to drink caffeinated soda chugging a cola or two can make kids act strangely not to mention act as a diuretic and a laxative if this is not the case she may have been too shy to ask for 'help' in the bathroom causing her to hold it until she lost control not to freak you out but loss of control when accompanied by other warning signs can be a sign of abuse there are many other possible reasons for her 'accidents' much more likely than someone hurting her but if you feel you have any cause for concern it might be something to look into  Fecal incontinence Atomic Kitten Toilet humour Caffeine The Fairly OddParents The Adventures of Pete & Pete Social rule Japanese toilet Urinary incontinence MC Hammer The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Knots Landing Babe Ruth Friends Ron and Fez Hypoglycemia Kimberly-Clark Corporation Vowel The Shining (film) Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Toilet Singlish Paul Is Dead Chris Jericho The Young Ones (TV series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kyle Broflovski Fathers' rights Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Rape Anorexia nervosa About a Boy Minor league baseball War of the Worlds (2005 film) I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can One Tree Hill (TV series) Anger management Crate training Urination Ben Johnson (athlete) Fast bowling Blink-182 Butters Stotch Involuntary commitment Pitaten Hey Jude Mnemonic Buttocks Divorce The Wack Pack Parachuting Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Good Times Characters in Bleach series Manual transmission Homer Simpson Recess (TV series) Softball Dead Like Me Yerba mate Gothic metal Terri Schiavo Diuretic English cricket team Tori Amos Emo Fasting Bart chalkboard gags Thom Yorke Billboard (advertising) Ranma __ characters Non-native pronunciations of English Jackass: The Movie George Costanza Cirrhosis Doug Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

is it ok that my month old son still sleep in my bed as long as you are fine with it who cares what any one else thinks america is the only country that forces their children to grow up and be independent too soon every other country encourages being close with their parents being a baby child and developing normally without being rushed into being a big kid before he's ready like how american's rush to get their newborns to sleep through the night regardless of how hungry they will get during the middle of the night remember their tiny tummy's are only as big as their fists and they need to eat more we rush them into learning how to hold their own bottles potty train them by the time they are okay sorry for the rant but going back to your question i see absolutely nothing wrong with him sleeping with you not only will he know he's safe because mommy is nearby but he'll have the added comfort security and bond with you too many parents force their infants to fend for themselves and sleep on their own what kind of security is that teaching them that they are stuck in their crib or stuck in their room regardless if they get scared or just want a parent to snuggle with they are left to fend for themselves i'd love to see the mentality personality comparisons of each group as adults it would be interesting to see who became the more well rounded adult  Breastfeeding Infant Co-sleeping Sudden infant death syndrome Humphrey Bogart Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Infantilism Abortion debate One Tree Hill (TV series) Urinary incontinence Sesame Street Comanche Child Child sexuality EastEnders Care Bears The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Lisa's First Word The Subtle Knife Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) John the Baptist Milton H.

my kid is about to start school for her first time my little girl just started school today i need some advice on some things that i should watch for she is very sensitive i dont want anyone being mean to her or stealing her lunch money she thinks that all of the kids are going to love her i have not told her that some of the kids may not like her i just need some advice please ask her about her day everyday quiz her on stuff that she did and what people said but make it sound like you're just curious so she doesn't think she has to watch out for people being secretly mean don't want to make her paranoid but you can do it without her realizing that's what you're doing you might also try volunteering at the school if you can to read stories or help with special functions this will make your presence known and kids are less likely to pick on a kid who's mom is going to be around unexpectedly at times been there twice already got another daughter ready to start next year best thing to do is let your daughter know she can talk to you about anything and keep a conversation going she'll be excited by all the new things and knowing you want to hear about it will make her want to tell you  Friends Shaggy dog story The Catcher in the Rye Milton H.

how can you love one little person so much and not burst just feeling overwhelmed with love for my little man tonite i wish he could comprehend just how precious he is to me is that too sappy i am trying to decide whether or not to have another child and i am wondering if my heart feels ready to burst with love for one child how will i ever have enough for i know i know people do it all the time and have way more than kids but i am feeling so ambivalent on one hand i would love for him to have a brother or sister to play with but on the other hand he is my whole world and i don't know if i can love another the same way i do him do other people feel this way too or am i just being a sap i have three daughters and i understand perfectly how you feel sometimes i just want to hug them and never let them go and i hate letting them leave the house for anything i miss them so much as for loving another child the same way you love this one you won't each child is different and you will not love them all the same way don't get me wrong you will love them equally but all for different reasons once you start getting to know their personalities and little quirks and such things as that then that will be why you love that child not because he's your child so much as for the little person he or she is you will love them for themselves and it will be just as strong as the love for all the other children when i talk to my kids ages and i tell them i love them all the same but for different reasons i want them to know that i love them not just because they are my kids but also for who they are i do admit when each new child came along i had a strange sense of loving one child more than the other but this didn't last long i had to really think about it to get my head around the fact that if any of them were harmed it would just about kill me equally no matter what after the period of adjustment i managed to realize that the strange feeling wasn't real or true it was just a mother's protective nature coming to the surface for a more helpless child ie the baby as the baby matured everything clicked back to normal and my kids never knew any different because my love for them never really dimmed at all it's nothing to worry about as for not having any other children there are pros and cons to both sides my sister has one son and he's spoiled rotten he has no other little person to share things with unless my sister finds time to take him to a play group which with two working parents is hard to do i as i mentioned have three kids and they all fight and carry on but they also help each other out and interact with each other on a daily basis one can teach the other about different things and they have someone to talk to if they can't talk to me personally i think having more than one is good but as you can see mine are also spaced out a great deal it allowed me the time to devote myself to one kid without stressing me to the point that i couldn't take care of the others other people might think close together is better because they get all the potty training and teething and such out of the way but i think being able to focus on one at a time to be a better way it's a personal preference though do what you think works best for you good luck  Jon Secada EastEnders Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct One Tree Hill (TV series) Friends The Contender (television series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infantilism The Fairly OddParents Pitaten Knots Landing Charmed A Course In Miracles Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Scenes from a Memory Milton H.

what are some signs that my daughter months needs her hearing checked i have a dr appt in a few weeks so please refrain from that line only respond if you are informed about this subject and not something that is copied and pasted off the internet she does respond to me when i call and when something gets dropped its mostly because of her speech is really muffled my friend said that her son acted the same as my daughter then she took him to get his hearing checked and they had to put tubes in his ears so now i am like how did i not know so i made a dr appt to get her hearing checked and feel so bad not thinking her speech could be cause of hearing problems you've done the right thing if your daughter's speech is delayed less than words or it seems mushy or garbled or unclear having her hearing checked is the first step if her hearing test is normal and her speech does not improve have her assessed by a speech pathologist not a therapist who specializes in young children you will get a report that specifies what stage her language is at from a developmental standpoint and a recommendation for further action for example you might find that she understands at a two year old level but speaks at a month old level this suggests delay due to hearing problems or oral motor problems if she is understanding and speaking at a one year old level then it may be a more global problem if necesary a developmental pediatrician is the next step to rule out autism and other developmental delays this takes time nine months from first screening to speech pathologist to developmental pediatrician for us to get a diagnosis of autism for our son and your daughter's problems may resolve naturally but it's better to get things started and stop them than to wait and be on longer waiting lists later if you are in ontario you should take your daughter to a first words screening clinic they have them in malls and community centers on a regular basis and this will get her on some waiting lists for funded speech therapy but for quickest results you need to go to a private speech pathologist i'm not sure if you have an appointment for a hearing assessment or just a doctor's appointment you can call clinics yourself and set up a hearing screening which is faster our speech pathologist found us a clinic we could see in a week rather that the six months we'd been told shop around good luck you're the best advocate your child has don't let anyone tell you not to worry and wait and see is well meaning but bad advice early intervention can do no harm oh i forgot get copies of every report your child has you may need to request this in writing but you have the right to a copy of anything to do with your daughter's health hope this helps  Prostate cancer Asperger syndrome Controversies in autism Medicine Terri Schiavo Stuttering Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Autism rights movement Clinical depression Traumatic brain injury Stomach cancer Stroke Multiple sclerosis Hearing impairment Alcoholics Anonymous Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Cancer Breast cancer Aphasia Autism epidemic Dyslexia Psychoanalysis Physical therapy Chronic fatigue syndrome Scientology beliefs and practices Breastfeeding Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders CPU cache Tocopherol Hypoglycemia Information Technology Infrastructure Library Sensory Integration Dysfunction Childbirth Asthma Social rule Child sexuality Urinary incontinence Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Colorectal cancer Alzheimer's disease Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Medical analysis of circumcision Hormone replacement therapy (trans) AIDS Androgen insensitivity syndrome Mental retardation Thimerosal Freedom of speech Growth hormone treatment Reparative therapy Canadian Senate Pervasive developmental disorder Folic acid Phimosis HIV Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Domain Name System Transsexuality Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ethical challenges to autism treatment Psychosis Obsessive-compulsive disorder First Amendment to the United States Constitution Hypnosis Religious Society of Friends Ben Johnson (athlete) Radiation therapy Dyspraxia Puberty Psychiatry Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Pregnancy CPU design HIV test Bipolar disorder Cytomegalovirus Terri Schiavo timeline Past teachings of Prem Rawat Anorexia nervosa Singlish Pediatrics Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Infantilism Second language acquisition Alternative medicine Mesothelioma Pathology Expert system Physician Coeliac disease National Institutes of Health Chiropractic

do you find yourself comparing your twins abilities even though you know that you shouldn't for example i have month old twin boys twin a started saying words much earlier than than twin b but now twin b has a much better grasp of language he speaks in sentences and he seems to pick up new vocabularly very well whereas twin a rarely uses any kind of sentence and often communicates by nonverbal yelling and pointing i know both are normal for their age group and i know how to work with twin a to improve his skills but sometimes i still compare them and worry about him all the time i have twin year olds we always compare them we have one who started talking a lot sooner as well he is also the more dominant personality so it seems the other twin just naturally let his brother speak for him i'm sure eventually they'll even out but it's natural to compare them we worried when they were younger but now it's not such a big deal  Autism Milton H.

has anyone done foster care i am thinking about foster care but i don't know of anyone that has done it and i want some tips on it i have boys now is years old and the other is years old any thoughts would be wonderful thanks a lot of people choose to preserve the birth orders in their original family by taking only children who are younger than their youngest child this is important to some people but not so much to others it was better for me to be the oldest child in a family because of my nurturing maternal personality though so it worked well for me to be in a family that did not worry about that a suggestion i would make is to be sure that your first placement is not a child with attachment disorder you might decide to take a child with this diagnosis someday but i would not suggest it for your first placement or while your children are so young because this is one of the most challenging and potentially dangerous diagnoses for the families to deal with when they are caring for a child also think about what you think you can and cannot handle can you handle working with the birth parent and trying to see things from their side can you handle a child going back to their birth parents before you think the birth parents are really ready to have them back can you handle misdirected anger can you handle a child who does not love you as much as you love them can you handle a fire starter a bed wetter a child who hurts animals if not you need to be upfront about all of this when you are working on getting your foster care license there are lots of kids to whom none of those things will apply but unless you say otherwise workers tend to assume you will accept the difficult cases  Transsexuality Adoption Breastfeeding Child abuse Autism Abortion debate Infantilism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Transactional analysis Social work Divorce Postpartum depression Autism rights movement Urinary incontinence Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hikikomori Reactive attachment disorder Controversies in autism Dissociative identity disorder Prenatal diagnosis Friends Childbirth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Anorexia nervosa Fathers' rights Parenting Polyamory Anger management Unemployment Taxi Driver Grief Jon Secada Foster care About a Boy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Childlove movement The Giver Calvin and Hobbes Spanking Hypoglycemia Charles Darwin's illness Anxiety Surveillance Gender identity disorder Melanie Wilkes Dead Like Me Bipolar disorder Cephalic disorder Terri Schiavo Down syndrome Family name Asperger syndrome Evil Epilepsy The Fairly OddParents Narcissism Hamster Milton H.

any ideas of fun pre k activities for a month old im looking for fun but at the same pre k activities to prepare my son for pre school any idea there is no reason at all to try and prepare your child for preschool let him have fun and let him play and that is the best way for him to learn talk to him pay attention to him enjoy being with him share your daily activities with him take him places with you around town and when you are out of town tell him about the world while he is out looking around at it with you reading to him is about the best educational thing you can do i've heard it said that kids need toys sand and water they learn a lot by being able to play with sand and water and a few cups or containers can make it a little more fun and educational i've also heard it said that the most important things to do with your child every day are to read to him and to cook with him play with him and let him enjoy being with you and let him enjoy playing with what he likes to do he will make it clear what he is interested in learning at any specific time by being interested in it if he is not enjoying something that you are trying to teach him don't bother at his age he needs to be able to learn completely on his own pace in fact he will not learn anything until he is ready for it he will just be bored or irritable if you insist on teaching him something and it will not help him to learn anything but rather will end up showing him that learning is boring if he likes to play hide and seek or catch or chase or roll over and get tickled or look at himself in the mirror and have you talk to him or have you point out where his nose and eyes are then do all those things with him and let him enjoy being with you  Avenue Q Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Pitaten About a Boy God Emperor of Dune Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Garfield Bart chalkboard gags Little Britain Milton H.

my five year old cousin keeps saying erotic instead of exotic what should i do he's obsessed with the word like if i show him something in the store he'll say in his cute little voice that's so erotic marlene he thinks it means exotic because when i asked him what he thought it meant he said it's not normal like another country it's far away like hawaii i told him he means exotic but it's hard for him to pronounce so i told him to say cool instead but he refuses and he says you aren't my mom marlene stop telling me what to say i told my aunt but she says she's never heard him say it he says it like four or five times a day when he's around me though should i do something about it you can try to do something about it but it is obvious that he is already closed to your help the majority of people understand that some children have a hard time saying certain sounds and won't look oddly at you or anyone with him when he says that talk to your aunt again tell her that you understand she hasn't heard him say this but he does say it maybe try to get him to say it in front of her not by prodding him but by providing a situation which would make him say that word so that she can hear it herself then ask her what she would suggest doing i would suggest that perhaps he get in for some sort of speech therapy then again he could grow out of it on his own  Milton H.

should i keep my son's potty seat in the bathroom while he is learning to use it my son is years and months and i'm starting to potty train him he wants to sit on the new potty chair we bought for him but only for a short time i was wondering if its a bad idea to bring it out say in front of the tv so he can sit on it longer while being a bit distracted at two years old he isn't going to have a long attention span so don't expect him to sit on the potty longer than a minute at most keep the potty seat in the bathroom give him one of those potty stories to read while he's on the seat in the beginning don't expect him to actually go just get him used to sitting on the seat when i potty train a child and i potty train at least children every school year i start by taking them to the potty about every mins then i also keep a chart in which i write down the times he is wet i do that only for a week to see if there are regular times when he seems to go then i can make sure he sits on the seat if that seem to be his voiding time i have the parents send in about pairs of cloth training or underpants and complete changes of clothing per day in the beginning i find that children cant really tell when they're wet with pullups because they do such a great job of absorbing all the pee even the new ones with the cool sensation isn't quite the same as cloth yes it's more laundry initially but soon the kids are potty trained and it's no more diapers except at nap night time the parents love that good luck and remember not to push too hard or you may stress the child and he could regress best wishes  Fecal incontinence Urinary incontinence Diaper Kimberly-Clark Corporation Toilet humour Undergarment The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Fairly OddParents Elimination communication Milton H.

older sibling and a new baby my son is very very excited for the arrival of his new baby sister but i am wondering about how he is going to react once she is here he just turned not a spoiled child and listens very well i was wondering if there is anything i can do to ease him into the idea of sharing mommy and daddy i have heard to make him feel like he is helping with the baby ie feeding getting the baby dressed any other suggestions to make this transition as smooth as possible with the least amount of jealousy and resentment it sounds like he is pretty much ready for her to show up and looking forward to it not sure there is much else you can do to prepare but i would say once she is here don't make him 'second fiddle' to her you will likely have a lot of people coming by to ooh and aah over the new baby that might make him feel left out make sure to plan some special time for the two of you without the little sister in tow if possible so he is getting just as much attention one thing i always do when visiting friends with a new baby is to make sure to bring a gift for both the baby and the sibling it's easy at that age to feel left out hope your friends and relatives do the same for your little guy good luck and congrats ps forgot to mention a friend of mine who had a son about the same age as yours put a sign up on the lawn that said josiah has a new little brother when the baby arrived he felt totally special that his name was on such a large marquee in front of their house and everyone who came by shook josiah's hand and congratulated him before even looking at the baby josiah's job was to hand everyone chocolate cigars  Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an AFI 100 Years series Jon Secada Friends EastEnders Knots Landing Avenue Q The Ashlee Simpson Show Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Jam (TV series) Piccolo Junior Saga Ayyavazhi mythology Marie Antoinette Sharon Tate Treehouse of Horror IX The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Mojave people Good Morning, Vietnam Customs and etiquette of Japan Pitaten The Apprentice 2 Guiding Light Grumpy's Three Wishes The Contender (television series) Melanie Wilkes Charmed Blood on the Tracks Characters in the Smurfs The Dalek Invasion of Earth Fred Phelps Rent (musical) Time Out of Mind Care Bears The Jazz Singer Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword About a Boy Continuation War Breastfeeding The Star Wars Holiday Special I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Pok__mon Live!

why do children typically like to play with really expensive nice things and not the things they are suppose to i'm going out of my mind i tell my son not to bother things and when i turn my back there he goes even for a second and it's not something that is like the trash can or dishwasher no it's our computer or messing with my vaccuum by the ways these are in dollar form washing machine it drives me nuts then when he messes with it my husband fusses at me when all i did was try to have him a glass of lemonade when he walked in the door from work when do children grow out of this stage when they are made to do chores he's sixteen months old make sure you are giving him stuff that he can play with instead of telling him what not to do don't try telling him what to do for example you can play with the toys on the floor or something like that many young children do not hear the 'don't' part of a direction and don't do something becomes do something further drawing attention to something by telling him not to touch it only makes it more enticing to the child give him plenty of things he can do and try telling him what you want him to do instead of what you don't want him to do i think you'll find that this helps a month old does not 'like to play with expensive things' he has no concept about what is expensive or not draw his attention to other toys and keep an eye on him months is very very young and he cannot be expected to remember directions such as don't play with that you need to monitor him around things you don't want him playing with and redirect him to appropriate toys and activities  Social rule Milton H.

my son just turned two years old and i'm trying really hard to get him potty trained not having so much luck he knows he's supposed to tell me when he has to go but he wants to go sit on the pot after he ruins his diaper any tips or tricks i just potty trained my son and daughter and i used the potty stool http www thepottystool com i started by just setting it at the toilet my kids immediately climbed up on the stool and discovered that they could safely use the toilet this got them very interested in using the toilet and they were potty trained very quickly it really helps boys to pee standing up so they can see what is happening and connect the sensations with the potty stool i like that i don't have to double the steps of potty training by training them first in a potty and then training them to stop using a potty and not dumping and cleaning a potty each time is great the best thing is that kids use it for years i hope this helps you  Toilet Fecal incontinence Toilet humour Toilet training Aerial (dance move) Elimination communication Urination Kimberly-Clark Corporation Urinary incontinence Japanese toilet Jackass: The Movie Shaggy dog story Sento Infantilism Diaper Parenting Dog training Feral child Four square Double bass Volleyball Ultimate Muscle Toilet paper Uniform Resource Locator Humphrey Bogart The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Rugrats Skateboarding trick Social rule SpongeBob SquarePants Vegeta The Body (Short Story) Sin City Violin Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Bristol Grammar School AFI 100 Years series Stomach cancer Captain Underpants Recess (TV series) HyperText Transfer Protocol Paragliding Shit El Chavo del Ocho Married... with Children Qur'an desecration controversy of 2005 Glossary of climbing terms Kimi Finster Phishing StarCraft: Uprising Dairy Milton H.

please any parents out there help me im taking care of a child for a week ive never had any children before he's months old and yesterday the babysitter was horrid she put the child to bed at pm in clothes that were soaking wet with mashed up food and juice now his bedtime is pm so he ended up being awake at pm so i of course changed his diaper and clothes feed him and then spent two hours playing with him to tire him out he ended up being tired and cranky but didnt want to go to bed so i spent minutes simply saying its bedtime sweety and placing him in bed and then he'd cry and get up and come out then id do the same thing sorry sweety its bedtime and place him in bed this went on for minutes i was shocked i didnt think they had that long of an attention span my friend not the parent told me that was compleately out of line i shoulda let the kid stay up i was trying to get back to the schedual was i wrong right what could i have done better that getting out of bed thing you're surprised that it went on for thirty minutes when i was teaching my son to sleep in his own bed alone at about that age he would keep getting out of bed for up to four hours several times a night is he already used to going to bed properly or is he accustomed to sleeping with someone else a parent or sibling a thing to remember is that playing with young kids to tire them out can actually just make them too tired and wound up to go to sleep before bedtime slow down with the playing do boring soft gentle things keep the tv off slow things right down try to stick to the schedule if this child is already used to a schedule on the other hand remember that being with someone else perhaps for the first time overnight is going to be a real surprise for a young child and they may not respond to their schedule as well as they did before it sounds to me like you were really patient and good about it so long as you always respond to problems patiently and kindly as well as firmly there can't be any problems too big to work through young kids are very flexible and the only really important thing is that you are patient and loving good luck  Care Bears Urinary incontinence Sleep Social rule EastEnders About a Boy Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mattress Humphrey Bogart Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Milton H.

my years old likes to hit or struck people when he has a temper tantrum what should i do in return my husband always hits back which didn't help much you cannot teach a child not to hit by hitting them just the same as you cannot mend a broken tap by breaking it or you can't teach someone to stop eating junk food by serving them junk food it is impossible of course your child is hitting people when he is angry isn't that precisely what he sees his father doing hitting him when he is angry with him he is doing what the most important man in his life his major role model is doing of course you have to make your house and your family a no hitting world no one can hit that's the rules that adults in the real world live by isn't it then that's the rules you must be teaching your child if i as an adult woman hit people at work when i disagreed with them you know what would happen to me i'd be charged and possibly arrested allowing kids to hit in anger is setting them up to fail in life when you son hits remove him instantly this is going to really test your abilities as parent you have to put him in his room and leave him there until he is ready to talk about it if he hits again you have to make sure he knows with absolute certainty what will happen that you will start removing his possessions from him one at a time until he has no toys left no clothes apart from the absolute basics no movies nothing this will only work if everyone in the house agrees and supports it if your husband keeps hitting your child your child will never stop hitting others good luck and i really recommend you get some parenting resources like parenting books from your local library find a plan that works stick with it and know that you are doing the best for your child  Kodocha Pitaten Theory of conduct The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe One Tree Hill (TV series) Piccolo Junior Saga Avenue Q Knots Landing About a Boy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friends Tenshinhan Divorce Escape from New York Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Spanking Baseball Characters of Naruto The Amber Spyglass God Emperor of Dune Fiddler on the Roof Rocko's Modern Life Poker jargon Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Child abuse The Shining (film) Ron Weasley Fathers' rights Justification (theology) Jean Grey The Jeffersons (South Park) Infantilism Family Original sin M16 (rifle) 1957 World Series Humphrey Bogart Autism Donald Neilson Second language acquisition Domestic violence Invader Zim Sin City Heinkel He 112 Transactional analysis Hulk (comics) Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Jackass: The Movie Static Shock Marriage Rich Mullins 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Ewoks: The Battle for Endor John F.

my grandson is always swearing and shouting when he plays computer games he even kicks the walls he s really loud i have to get him off their its horrible how can i control this weird behaviour it the same with all the children my grandson is the same when he is allowed to play these games and so his parents restrict him to morning afternoon and perhaps after his tea but not before he goes to bed it seems as though they get possessed when they play these games children need to be monitored and not left to their own devices when playing these games no matter what tantrums they try on to get their own way spare the rod and spoil the child that old adage serves as well today as it did years ago and todays parents would do well to heed this including my own daughter  Avenue Q Jean Grey Tag Shaggy dog story Console game Computer and video games History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) EastEnders Pinball Pete Sampras 2000 Australian Grand Prix Characters of Naruto Book of Joshua Child abuse Sydney Riot of 1879 Football (soccer) Spanking Futurama (TV series - season 5) Slot machine Child sexuality ZX Spectrum Pittsburgh Steelers Nintendo Entertainment System Game Boy The Den (television) Video game console Commodore 64 Kain (Legacy of Kain) Baby Blues Marie Antoinette Computer and video game genres Amiga Power Sly Cooper Nuclear reactor Jacob Water polo Transactional analysis Combine (Half-Life 2) Game controller South Park Rais massacre Sub-Zero The Catherine Tate Show 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Jason Voorhees Atari ST Noah Little Britain Romulus and Remus School bus Atari 8-bit family TV game Super Bowl XVIII Cheating in Counter-Strike Marathon (computer game) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Yu-Gi-Oh! main characters Motion picture rating system Super Bowl XIV SMTV Live Santa Claus Russian joke National Football League Color Super Bowl XV OpenGL Eric Cartman Ryo Bakura Saint Nicholas Domestic violence Calvin and Hobbes WNNX (FM) The Ashes Censorship in Australia Veruca Salt Regional lockout Rugby union Insomnia Super Bowl XIII Canadian football Super Bowl XXV Hearing impairment G-Man (Half-Life) Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Codename: Kids Next Door Comparison of Canadian and American football Rod Stewart Tea Team Rocket Emulator Polyamory Code: Lyoko About a Boy Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Final Fantasy Legend III John the Baptist The Doctor Dances

what would happen if you isolate toddlers from parents last night my yr nephew struck his cousin for attention it was a publicity stunt that failed and toddlers were sent running and crying everyone was watching david blane do tricks on tv leaving the toddlers neglected by their parents and the teenaged and pre teen cousins could only watch as trouble unfolded my nephew ima teen struck ferious blows with giggles and smiles directed toward us at another or yr old toddler making her cry and then the parents came and said bad these parents dont know any severe punishments but saying bad is enough to hurt a spoiled brat so if toddlers were put in a place where no parents could see them where no feel of neglect could ever be felt because its not possible without parents what would the toddlers do ive seen my nephew make messes and throw things around for attention sometimes toddlers trying to understand grown ups cause too much trouble try to answer the main question by something like a thought experime if i sound inconsiderate or mean or unthoughtful or neglectful its just because im curious all i could imagine happening is that the toddlers would become philosophical in nature and try to solve problems and answer questions of their own mysteries children need love without it they become needy and struggle with relationships when they are older kids that are hit hit kids that are yelled at yell toddlers do things to find out what will happen if he hits another child and is laughed at and not told its bad he will continue to do it if he is smacked for smacking someone he will continue to smack people the cries of a child when they are hit by another child arent as significant to the child that hit them becasue they havent yet developed a sense of empathy and therefore dont realsie i hurt them this is learned it needs to be explained to them until they develop further so saying bad isnt as good as saying look what you have done that is very naughty you hurt hurt her him how do you think it makes him her feel and take somethign away that they want eg no more playing left to there own devcies understanding such things at this age particularly would be impossible and learning it wouldtake an extended amount of time give them attentio for being good and they will try to be good dont give attention for being bad or they will continue to be bad  Social rule Theory of conduct Narcissism Autism EastEnders Spanking Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) The Flintstones Friends Teen Girl Squad Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Transactional analysis Pitaten Simone Weil Piccolo Junior Saga Abortion debate Goodness and value theory Jon Secada Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Marshall Mathers LP Avenue Q Humphrey Bogart Mojave people Infantilism Incarnations of Immortality Futurama (TV series - season 5) Theodicy Justification (theology) Silent Night, Deadly Night The Lovely Bones About a Boy The Sims 2 Supernatural Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Current teachings of Prem Rawat Columbine High School massacre 2000 Australian Grand Prix Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Muslim ibn Aqeel Philosophy of language Rugrats Boston Public Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Nicomachean Ethics W.I.T.C.H.

when is it okay to leave toddler in bath alone i have an month old daughter and i do believe she is too young to be left alone i just want to know when you all started being secure with leaving your children in the bathtub without supervision i am a little paranoid about it so i haven't a clue as to when it is the right time thanks for all your input please know that i am not asking if i can leave her alone right now that isn't the question i wouldn't even if every one said i could i am not comfortable with that i am simply asking when you all felt comfortable with it so that i have a general idea of what most parents think is the right time thanks again it depends on the child my oldest didn't start taking a bath alone until he was my daughter is and i am able to leave her alone and have been for about a year now i still check on them both and they are not allowed to lock the door they need help with their hair from time to time but they usually do a good job my youngest is and i don't leave him alone at all while he is in the tub if the phone rings one of the other kids can get it or i will call them back he is all over the tub playing so he could easily slip and hurt himself you will have to be the judge on when your child is ready most likely around age when she is ready make sure you have a non slip mat and make sure your razors are out of site even older children can try to shave and really hurt themselves  The Shining (film) The Inside Customs and etiquette of Japan Sento Social rule Friends Theory of conduct Ben Johnson (athlete) The Giver Professional wrestling holds Textile manufacturing Pitaten Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Good Times Child Shaggy dog story Charles Peace Knife Knots Landing Shaving Good Morning, Vietnam Swimming pool The Amazing Race Have I Got News For You Aerial (dance move) Codename: Kids Next Door Kyle Broflovski Little Britain 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Milton H.

discipline and puncuality in our office life please at least or words it's kinda hard for me to understand your question and i do believe you have it posted in the wrong section unless you have a lot of toddlers working in your office which i do believe goes against child labor laws as far as discipline though time outs and taking away privileges works pretty good for me and if you find a good trick on getting a toddler to be punctual let me know because i am always struggling with my month old when i went to get him ready to go somewhere he likes to run the other way so i try and start getting ready way before hand to give me time for the craziness of a toddler but that isn't always possible  Extreme Programming Kodocha Theory of conduct Plame affair The Sims 2 Abortion debate Infant baptism Slayers Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Child time-out Rich Mullins Article One of the United States Constitution Humphrey Bogart Bernard Williams Current teachings of Prem Rawat Soul 2000 Australian Grand Prix Time Out of Mind Pedophilia 1957 World Series Teletubbies Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Good Morning, Vietnam Past teachings of Prem Rawat Friends About a Boy Goodness and value theory Economics Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Escape from New York Value system The Book of Five Rings Coming of Age (TNG episode) John Howard Yoder Punishment Shaggy dog story Ten Commandments Blood on the Tracks Anarchism and capitalism Contract bridge Rugrats Laws of cricket Charles Grandison Finney Kimi Finster The Ashlee Simpson Show The Flintstones Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Milton H.

parents what do you think of my discipline method just the other day we wrote down a discipline plan for our just turned year old he's overall a well behaved child and we would like to keep it that way we do have our bad days though i tend to be pretty lienent and permissive that's just my parenting style i guess anyway looking for feedback from experienced parents or whomever cares to answer what do people think about this what's missing anything that won't work save yelling 'no' for dangerous activities instead of saying 'no' or 'don't ' show or tell the correct way to do something or simply distract with something else three strikes meaning that he gets two warnings to stop a behavior and on the third he gets the object of misuse taken away reward for good behavior verbally or with hugs etc be consistent about what is and is not acceptable behavior not strict enough any suggestions thanks pardon my spelling errors my checker never works on here brilliant love it also conside the idea of house rules pick three rules and stick them on the fridge leave them there choose really important things that are simple mine are no hitting or hurting others we listen to each other no arguing after mummy says enough is enough but at the same time don't be afraid to show controlled anger if something really inappropriate occurs not anger which belittles the child but anger which is a firm absolutely disapproving emotion mostly because kids do need to understand that humans have a range of emotions and when a child sees that an adult can be angry and still not lose their cool still be respectful and not throw a tantrum then they understand better how to handle their own anger it's a principle of modelling anger management because all kids do experience anger and rage and they need to see safe productive ways of handling and directing those negative emotions good luck oh and i agree that there should not be three strikes it's like saying someone can get in a free hit you know in life we often do not get three strikes if i hit someone i won't be given three chances i'll be charged and prosecuted serious misbehaviour should be given its consequence immediately on the first occasion after two or three occurrences cheers  Theory of conduct Domestic violence Transactional analysis Extreme Programming Social psychology Traumatic incident reduction Spanking Motivation Narcissism Second language acquisition Economics Sexual orientation Autism Goodness and value theory Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Internet troll Theodicy Electrophysiology Dog training Anger management Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Asperger syndrome Milton H.

what should be the best things to do about my son years old when it comes to his attitude he always teased his sister and he is naughty set limits and boundaries and make sure you have clear and reasonable consequences for each offense consistency is key if the behavior is unacceptable it needs to be unacceptable all the time time outs are a good method if they do not work well for him you could try taking away a toy or privilege a good idea is to have a chart maybe laminated where he can track his good and bad behavior all day when he has bad behavior mark it off and after a certain number of offenses punishment then when he has a good behavior you can praise it and reward it this becomes a good bargaining tool too  Evil Child time-out Nicomachean Ethics Theory of conduct Ethics Infantilism Merit Dog training Behaviorism Social justice Goodness and value theory Cheating in Counter-Strike 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Microeconomics Economics Sexual orientation Social psychology Psychoanalysis Contract Michelle Tanner Punishment Capital punishment 1957 World Series Homosexuality Operant conditioning Justification (theology) Religion Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Batting average Gay Mojave people Efficiency wages Volleyball Noam Chomsky Euphemism Seventeen-article constitution Singlish Poker jargon Karen Horney Ultimate (sport) Punisher Theodicy Scientology beliefs and practices Anchor Consensus decision-making Motivation Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) John Howard Yoder Debugging Reinforcement Species Human nature Originalism Billboard Hot 100 Summa Theologiae Moral objectivism Game theory Normal distribution Alignment (role-playing games) Attribution theory Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals Simone Weil Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Politics Supply and demand Religious pluralism Internet troll Martin Heidegger Cricket Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Laws of Form Utilitarianism Atheism Gender role Social rule Soul Human sexual behavior Crime and Punishment C__line Dion PaX Housebreaking Free will Science Meme Taxation in the United States God and gender Article One of the United States Constitution Homosexuality in China Python programming language Password Mind control Dog agility Logic Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Beatmania IIDX Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Hash table Crime prevention through environmental design Clicker training

how do you cure a five year old girl of snippiness can someone give me any solutions for a little girl who likes to sass back roll her eyes at me and bob her head up and down mouth words you know the blah blah blah she just came to live with me from nana's house and has been terribly indulged time outs have proved fruitless i need a powerful solution that sends an immediate message also if i put her in a corner she shrieks at the top of her lungs help here please it is really easy to resort to violence isn't it i was thinking along the lines that the women have handed me thus far lol yes earplugs but what about the neighbours i may look at the book as well but believe me it is very tempting to resort to the spanking and 'popping' on the mouth i had even considered using a spray bottle but apparently that is considered abuse i agree with nick with katknit and maber but definately feel sorry for dani with much support and utmost respect i wish to speak out on this subject without meaning any insult or harm to all of us parents trying so very hard to raise our children or those of others dani with five children it isn't the amount of children you have sweetie you are always the boss and capable of controlling all of what your kiddo's do or don't do if you can't and continue to believe this theory each year that passes you will certainly loose more ground your children into their teens will continue to challenge you you will find you can't control them because you wasted valued time showing them in earlier years who was boss and when they are bigger they hit back and of course we have all heard of those who have turned totally against the parents to cause harm maber i think is the one who said that this is perhaps a larger problem and one that isn't being seen for what it really is with my experience over the years this is correct however the lady asking the question isn't the natural parent from what i understood and the problem is already there and seems to be a carry over from another household the book recommended to read is a good one but she might not have the correct time to read it along with other books i also don't know the family dynamics or the reason the child is now there or how long she is willing to try to care for the child the childs life constantly changing as to where she lives or who is caring for her is also a huge part of the past problem i'm sure my recommendation is the same as most of the ones who said she doesn't like the corner so it is correct information to continue to place her there however do not allow her to shriek at all when children need time out the best form is not into there room or another place as long as they remain quiet this is not a good rule to follow because the truth is they won and you lost no matter how you try to believe otherwise this is why you have a repeat problem if the parents choose the childs room now what about teen years do any of these parents realize the number of year olds and up that committ sucide when sent to their rooms and on another note never let the child close their bedroom door for privacy this is one wrong way parents are allowing children to think they are on the same level as the parents with the same rights and need for privacy an adult feels peace and privacy behind a closed door children tend to feel closed off and this is the first sign of pulling away from the family structure and the reason a child does it or wants to a corner of the room you are currently in is the best solution with the following points to ponder to correct children with problems calmly tell the child while making eye contact your behavior is unacceptable and this will not continue use an even voice tone and do not raise it you must show a flat even tone because this shows the child you are in control if the child refuses to hold eye contact make them by saying your time in the corner won't start until you show respect by holding eye contact i refuse to be rude to you by not having eye contact if they scream yell or other say the samething but change words to suit screaming if they insist on screaming raise the bar by showing control you can do this with severe screamers by telling them they will start standing in the corner till they stop screaming but the clock for the punishment doesn't start till after that time served it will just take you longer so you might want to reduce your time in the corner i do know of one who was such a screamer they told the child that for that part they would serve time in the corner with a book held out in each hand as it was much harder to scream and be rude while holding the books at arms length but i never had to do this myself and still undecided myself but it did work and in theory stiffer crimes stiffer punishment after screaming punishment is served if it was needed then tell them you are in the corner until such time you can tell me what you did wrong why it was wrong and what you can do the next time as a better choice i swear this works in this way you are not excusing the behavior allowing them off with time served allowing them the opportunity to think about it themselves and to be accountable for their actions if you see them playing with the wall or singing gently say don't forget you can't get out and us move on to happier fun times until you have given thought to what you did and we discuss it if they aren't standing tell them to stnad or the clock will get turned back or time added if it is dragging on for too long to mins make a phone call and discuss with the air how you are going to call a sitter because jane is having a problem and you might need one if you and hubby are still going out to dinner when they come to discuss this issue let them talk and answer each point mentioned above if their answer was appropiate then state that fact that they must have really given this correct thought tell them that we all make mistakes but if they repeat the very same one the time in the corner next time will increase if the answers were correct tell them good job but you need to return to keep up the good thoughts your almost done younger children you can ask questions from if they didn't cover all the answers correctly by suggesting correct ones and watch their attitude when you excuse them to walk away it is a good practice to say we all make mistakes but learn from them over and done when we can be consistent with our words it is these very same words later that control our children in the public eye without others hearing the screaming and show that follows the simple words and eye contact showing your displeasure of their actions does work saying your behavior is unacceptable is enough to control a child later on if not remove them into the lady's room and tell them they will be removed if necessary and return home to be delt with don't use the word punishment if possible this tells their small mind that they will punish you back good luck isn't needed you just simply take over calmly and get the job done but you can do it parents must be stronger then their childs will their will as they get older only increases  Scientology

my year old daughter is scared of the dark and wont sleep alone i have a year old healthy daughter who's turning soon she won't sleep alone in the dark in her room unless me or her father is beside her untill she falls asleep she says shes scared if someone comes into the house to hurt her she had a scary dream around a week ago and it made it worse is this normal how can i help i'm almost and i don't enjoy sleeping in complete darkness myself either i mean the kind of darkness where you can't even see your hand in front of your face it's claustrophobic to me i enjoy having the soft light from a streetlight outside my window or at least the glow of the clock our bedside clock has a particularly bright display so it's helpful so it could be something as simple as that or as others said it may be that the fear is stemming from something else something frightening may have happened to her it seems that to be scared of someone coming inside to hurt her might indicate that this has happened to her or almost happened to her does she date did some guy try to do something with her that she didn't want to do did she have a frightening episode at work is there a coworker that freaks her out is there someone at school who is bullying her bullying doesn't just happen in middle school it can take on lots of forms it could be tons of things the best thing you can do is talk to her and try to figure out together what is really scaring her if you can't get anywhere with her and this continues then there is nothing wrong with getting some counseling it is in my opinion abnormal for a yr old to be that scared of sleeping alone something had to have caused the fear i feel awful for her because fear is such a paralyzing thing best of luck and i hope it gets better soon god bless  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Out-of-body experience EastEnders The Subtle Knife The Death Gate Cycle Pitaten The Amber Spyglass One Tree Hill (TV series) W.I.T.C.H.

toddler hitting baby what do i do my month old is hitting her baby brother she also throws things at him separating them isn't really an option this doesn't happen when she gets angry with him she'll be in a perfect mood and all of a sudden throw something at him or she'll be talking to him and holding his and and all of a sudden hit him so i can't really stop her because i don't know what to expect right before it happens sometimes i am holding him when it happens and other times he is in his swing he's weeks old i have tried time out saying no telling her what to hit instead of her brother etc nothing seems to work are there any tricks to getting her to stop doing this and i hate to say it but she has gotten a spanking from doing it that didn't work and i don't want to do it again how do i get her to stop and i don't want to tell her that she can't touch her brother at all because i want her to continue the loving relationship she shows towards him the other of the time she's very attuned to his needs and i often ask her what the baby wants so far she's never been wrong i am going through the exact same thing my year old is very protective of his little brother now mos he asks where my friends are taking him in his car seat won't give permission to others to hold him and watches him like a hawk things have been very different recently these past few days while i am out of the room from both of them he's grabbed one of his toy bins and put it over the baby's head and pushed on it pushed him over hit him with toys he's thrown food at him covers his face with a blanket and just today he bit his finger i'm beginning to think he likes making him cry i know he's doing it at least twice a day the baby is pretty mellow and barely cries and now it seems he's crying for no reason when i rush to investigate i hear little feet thumping away from the scene he seems to even do it on the days where i sit with him and do puzzles and draw the only thing i can think of is to ask advice from my doctor you may want to try too  Humphrey Bogart Milton H.

is it safe to take an month old to a swimming pool to swim with a life jacket fitted to him and i have first aid and also was a lifeguard only taugh teen adult lessons no longer certified though i think it's great to take young kids in the pool at that age they're going to learn to splash around and get used to the water and maybe even put their faces in i agree with all the others i would definitely stay with him and within reach at all times i would forego the lifejacket though if you are actively swimming with him he won't need it without it he will be able to splash around and play more freely greatly increasing the chance that he'll enjoy the water also he'll learn about his body's natural bouyancy which will help get him ready for learning to swim also if he thinks he can swim because of his life jacket he might go running into the water sometime without it when you aren't close by thinking he can swim  Personal flotation device Drowning Diving Lifeguard Swimming pool Breaststroke Swimming Tag Diving suit Triathlon History of swimming Scuba set Cartoon Network Adult Swim Shark Boy Scouts of America Backstroke Fountain Splash pad Butterfly stroke Kitesurfing Infantilism Mojave people Final Fantasy: Unlimited Urban beach Bathing Bottlenose Dolphin Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Platypus Aerial (dance move) Frogman YMCA Front crawl Kender Jeans Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Beavis and Butt-head Baptism Sport Futurama (TV series - season 5) German commando frogmen Body piercing Sauna USS William B.

potty training questions ok i have questions about potty training my son just turned and i have no idea when to begin potty training i would like to start now but he doesn't talk so it's not going to be easy what are the signs that he will show of being interested in potty training do you have any tips or advice on potty training i put him on the potty before he gets a bath but he hasn't peed while on it yet when he does i will make a big deal about it to encourage him to keep doing it just get a little potty and every time you go to the bathroom sit him on the potty while you sit on yours talk to him about peeing and pooping tell him mommy is pooping can you poop to make sure to use these words often when changing his diapers if you are uncomfortable with your child being in the bathroom with you then do not use this method since he will pick up on your tension and think something is wrong i started maya this way at months not taking off her clothes just letting her sit while i sat until she asked to take down her diaper and pants and there was never any pressure no tears and no stress it was easy as pie she also couldn't talk well when we started but i didn't let that bother me there are other ways for him to tell you and you will know when he needs to go it needs to be a process and go slow let him take the lead in mast things also the first time he actually 'goes' in the potty cheer him and show him what he did but do not go to wild since chances are he will have no clue how he did it but if he knows it made you happy then he will try to do it again this helps him develop those muscles and get to know this part of his body without you 'hovering' since you will be busy with 'business' of your own also let it be a process do not expect him to be trained in a month or even two this will cause disappointment for you and him just be relaxed and laid back maya took until months to be daytrained and even then i put a pull up on her when going out of the house but i have not bought pull ups since she turned we have a couple in case she asks but she never does anymore  Toilet humour Urination Fecal incontinence Aerial (dance move) The Inside Shaggy dog story Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Toilet training Theory of conduct Avenue Q Garfield Jackass: The Movie Japanese toilet Infantilism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Buttocks Sento Diaper Dog training The Ashlee Simpson Show Toilet 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Elimination communication Slow Train Coming Kodocha Jam (TV series) Friends Parenting Crate training Wheel of Fortune God Emperor of Dune Humphrey Bogart Diving Equine conformation Big Brother (USA TV series) John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Textile manufacturing Norway national football team Pitaten Joke The Smoking Room Babe Ruth Traumatic incident reduction Combat stress reaction Extreme Programming Knots Landing Tai Chi Chuan Little Britain Professional wrestling holds Condom Time Out of Mind Coming of Age (TNG episode) The Amber Spyglass Sin City Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Identity and change Swingout 2000 Australian Grand Prix Piccolo Junior Saga Moe Szyslak Grandview, U.S.A.

month old biting my daughter bit me yesterday now other people have been telling me over the passed couple weeks that she has bit them but i didn't think she did it on purpose but she straight out just bit my leg yesterday out of nowhere then after i yelled at her for it she tried to bite me again while she was crying i really couldn't believe it all other people talk about is how sweet and gentle she is and she is but this was kinda scary i was wondering if all kids go through a stage like this or is it because she's in daycare and learning it if your kid s did go through this stage were they in daycare or have older siblings they learned it from or is this like a 'natural' thing they figured out just for the record i don't believe in spanking anyway i know that only results in her thinking that hitting is okay plus i just think it's wrong i'm thinking about trying time outs for discipline on biting but i'm not really sure she'll 'get that' just yet we'll see i'm surprised it took her this long most toddlers bite when they are teething you have to understand that she doesn't understand that it hurts you a child of that age has a very limited understanding that others have feelings and the reaction can be quite amazing to a little one hehe mine has recently learned to hang up the phone while mommy is talking generally speaking if a behaviour doesn't get them what they want then it stops pretty quickly then again it can be hard not to scream depending on where they bite and whether you were paying attention  Piccolo Junior Saga Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Milton H.

my two year old son doesn't answer me when i ask him a question what is another approach i can take rather than simply asking the question again get down on his level tell him to look you in the eye if he looks away stop and tell him to look you in the eye make sure he is looking you in the eye while you ask don't let him walk away or not answer he must then answer and will stand there till he does another thing to add to this is if the question is asking him to do something he is not allowed to go do it till he responds with a yes mom while looking you in the eye or something to that equivilant that is right for his age eye contact is a huge thing cause then he can't say even later in life i didn't hear you cause he was looking you right in the eye he might not talk lots yet but he understands so much more start the good habits while he is still young this takes some consistency but when he figures out what is expected it works wonders  Social rule Milton H.

he wont listen what do i do my son is in general a very good kid most everything i tell him to do not do he listens the only problem i have with him is he keeps playing in the bathroom it is attached to his room so unless im supervising every move of the time i dont know if hes in his room or the bathroom i cant lock him out or anything cuz its the bathroom i took all the chemicals out so thats not a concern but thats gross i dont want him playing in there and every time i catch him at least times a day i ask him what are you doing he always responds with playing in the bathroom i know im not supposed to so i know he knows better i have spanked him taken things away done time out and nothing is working its frustrating the hell out of me if he knows hes not supposed to how do i make him stop unless he is playing in the toilet then you might just have to let it go if he is in the toilet then get a toilet lock keep it super clean and let him play in it it could be worse give him a clorox wipe and let him wipe up the area he usually plays in so he has some responsibility sounds like he is old enough the bathroom is actually not even as germy a room as the kitchen in most houses so it isn't so bad or just lock him out of it if you are really against it if there is another bathroom in the house he can use that one but eventually you will have to let him back in it and then the problem starts again perhaps ignoring the problem will make it less attractive to him good move to take everything out of it though  Japanese toilet Toilet Toilet paper The Shining (film) Bathroom Fecal incontinence Shaggy dog story Bristol Grammar School Friends Social rule Beavis and Butt-head Punk ideology Kitchen Washroom Bidet Dormitory Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Toilet humour Changeroom Pitaten Saw II The Brady Bunch Colony in Space The Inside Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan Patrick Star Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Video game music Euphemism Theory of conduct Operation Market Garden Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Kimberly-Clark Corporation Utilitarianism Property (ownership right) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Jam (TV series) About a Boy Queensbridge Blood Simple Menstrual cup Rugby union positions StarCraft: Uprising House Chinglish Knife 1957 World Series EastEnders Urinal Ron Weasley Poker jargon Russian joke Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide 2000 Australian Grand Prix Vegeta Chess terminology The Time Machine Piccolo Junior Saga Professional wrestling holds Phoebe Halliwell Ariel (Firefly episode) Operation Petticoat Treehouse of Horror V Paul W.

single mom with little boy need advice my son is two months away from his th birthday he sees his dad on the weekend sometimes for the day and sometimes overnight the issue right now is that if a man ie his dad uncle grampa asks him to do something he does it if i ask him he fights and throws himself on the floor or runs away i literally feel like i have i have no control i have read and used the theory of magic for discipline advice and had fairly good results but being in his room he throws things and breaks thing and i do not want to do time out any other suggestions on dealing with this one pick your battles carefully your son is learning to think and prioritize for himself and he may have a different set of priorities than you do he is comfortable and trusting enough with you to say no without fear that you will whack him so when he does say no think carefully about what you have asked him to do and whether or not it s worth the effort and let him have his say on the unimportant battles when you do let him have his way tell him he s right or tell him he s wrong but it s not worth fighting about teaching children they can have opinions even if it runs counter to popular opinion and authority is not a bad thing two don t get mad at him when he says no smile at him and be his friend maybe even laugh if the task at hand is important enough buddy up to him and inspire him to do it come on you can do it gently very gently with an arm over his shoulders lead him to what he needs to do keep smiling true leadership inspires without fear three a lot of different techniques can accomplish what you want with your son but it s important you pick one and stick with it four remember that your son is learning a lot from you and not always what you think you re teaching him so you may think you re teaching him to brush his teeth pick up his room get ready for bed etc and in fact he s also learning how you get other people to do things so if you opt to whack him guess what he s learning if you choose to bully and belittle him guess what he s learning and if you choose to gently lead and inspire guess what he s learning none of this is easy and i don t suggest that what i advocate is a cake walk but then raising our children is the hardest most important and most rewarding thing we can do  Theory of conduct Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Spanking The Adventures of Pete & Pete Current teachings of Prem Rawat The Fairly OddParents Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Little Britain About a Boy Calvin and Hobbes Dog training Avenue Q Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?

can i start potty training before my son can talk my son is years old i assume he is like every other normal child he can say a few words here and there can't put any words together yet though or if he can he just hasn't done it he knows what his mother and i are saying to him when we ask him questions and give him commands he answers our questions and obeys our commands for the most part and he knows when he has done something wrong does anyone have any good suggestions about how you can potty train a child that can't talk or should we wait until he can put words together so far our efforts of showing him the potty and getting him to sit on it alongside mommy and daddy and trying to anticipate his potty times aren't working we can sit him on the chair and he won't do anything but right after we get him off like minutes not always that soon later he will go in his diaper please help out of ideas father just continue what you are doing when you go to the bathroom just sit him on his little potty while you go have mom do it as well he may take a while but do not make a big deal when he wets his diaper or anything i started doing this with maya well before she could talk we started when she began walking and it took about months for her to become completely potty trained granted we started a lot earlier but i think that this no pressure way is much better for the child then just one day telling them oh you have to use the potty now no matter what age you start it needs to be a process maya started at about nine months we did it not for potty training at first i just did it because she would freak if i tried to leave her when i went to the bathroom just be patient wait until he accidentally uses the potty then do the praise thing don't go overboard just say wow look you peed in the potty like daddy good job he probably won't even know how he did it at first but he will try to do it again once you are sure that he has control over those muscles then start trying to put him on after meals and drinks etc also the best time to start getting the first accidental pee or poop is in the morning when he wakes up or after a nap it is almost an automatic reflex so watch for him to start stirring and get him on the potty as he is waking up  Shaggy dog story Toilet humour Urinary incontinence Milton H.

why aren't modern playgrounds built in the shade my four year old loves to go to the playground but it's summer and i've discovered that most playgrounds have no shade whatsoever here we are in a beautiful park with huge beautiful shade trees all around us and in a flat treeless area out of range of any shade whatsoever sits some plastic and metal playground equipment on a bed of wood chips not even the parent benches have shade most of the time they're hard metal uncomfortable and blazing hot after ten o'clock in the morning i know there must be a good reason for this probably some silly liability issue but i can't imagine what it would be how would it increase the park's liability to build the playground in range of the shade trees any ideas money it's cheaper and faster to clear out the trees and pull in the playground equipment my dad has been in the construction business for years i asked him once about residential subdivisions being totally cleared of any tree before construction begins why couldn't they leave some big old trees and build around them i understand not leaving all but some he said it was much more time on the clock for the designers architects engineers to come up with a safe and aesthetically pleasing plan and time consuming for the crew to put together something that had be built around an existing structure our town has some great playgrounds with canopies on them and on that recycled rubber flooring that's got a spring to it rally your fellow parents to city hall and get one of these built shade http www shadesystemsinc com gallery htm floor http www floorscore com playground  Plastic Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Seismic retrofit Architecture New Urbanism Tag Drill bit Paintball Dundas Square Drag racing Lechaina Ludwig Mies van der Rohe Whitton, London Garfield Chatsworth House Sento Yosemite National Park Deforestation B-47 Stratojet Passenger car Sewage treatment Computer Sundial Atari 8-bit family Wood carving Naval mine Parliament House, Canberra Shaggy dog story Pebble bed reactor Mouse (computing) Fountain Central processing unit Baseball Crime prevention through environmental design Sugar Land, Texas Solar power Application-specific integrated circuit Cerritos, California Heinkel He 100 Wood W.

my toddler is very attached to his poo my year old has always hated his nappy being changed but recently the tantrums have gotten worse whenever he poos he always runs off to do it and the reason i know he has done one is because he wont bother me at all he stays away because he doesnt want to be changed today when i found him hiding with his pooey nappy he screamed when i went to change him like really screamed and then screamed for minutes afterwards and kept trying to get it out of the bin and put it back on he got himself into a real state until he eventually fell asleep i have heard of male toddlers being more attached to their poo anyone know about this i think its the poo because he is fine getting a wee changed and its not the changing bit that upsets him its that he actually wants the poo back out of the bin and to put it back on he doesnt want a new clean nappy why is it you think he is attached to his poo and not that he just doesnt like being changed sometimes yr olds can do uncommon things to show a like or dislike for something id put my bet on him just not liking being changed than him being attached to it jmo edit ok well if you think its the poo then maybe use it as a start for potty training it sounds strange but kids go for some weird things that work when training make it a goodbye like memorial service when he poos in the toilet make it fun sing a song or something and tell him if he poo's in the toilet instead of in his diaper lol or nappy i guess youre not from the us you can say bye bye to the poo etc if you make it fun for him it might solve this problem and also help gettin him outta diapers  Diaper Conker's Bad Fur Day Ron and Fez Atomic Kitten Salad Fingers Recurring South Park characters Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Elimination communication Jackass: The Movie Toilet Rugrats Social rule Shit Kimberly-Clark Corporation Toilet humour The Angry Beavers South Park The Curse of Fenric Family Guy Sin City Rammstein Infantilism The Marshall Mathers LP Pitaten Scenes from a Memory "Weird Al" Yankovic Captain Underpants Hey Jude Viz (comic) Infidels Pok__mon Live!

my son wants to use potty when he's bored argh my year old son has been potty trained daytime for about months now at home he can go a few hours in between potty breaks when we go out especially at restaurants he insists on using the potty every minutes i think he's bored so going to the potty is interesting for him after a few trips to the potty nothing even comes out but he insists that he has to go i'm happy that he tells us he has to go instead of having accidents but it's getting kind of difficult to have to take him over and over when he doesn't have to go is this just a normal phase for kids his age thanks for the advice mari it's normal but i'd suggest bringing cars and small toys he can use at the table explain that he can go potty before the food comes and again when you're ready to leave the restaurant but that he will need to hold it if he has to go in between if your son actually needs to go to the bathroom twice in that half an hour timespan then i'd take him to the doctor once he realizes that you won't take him he'll get the hint and stop asking or he won't be able to go out to eat anymore if he insists on getting up and he has a false alarm then his treat of going out to dinner is over and you need to take him home he'll get the idea very quickly  Kitchen Colony in Space Episodes of Lost (Season 2) SpongeBob SquarePants Knots Landing Urinary incontinence The Fairly OddParents The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Little Britain 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Restaurant Toilet training The Apprentice 2 History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Stomach cancer Haven (TNG episode) Pok__mon Live!

what does everyone think did anyone hear on the news last night about the educational videos out for babies and toddlers no names being that in recent studies they have slowed the develpoment of children's vocabulary and speech does everyone think that this is because of the videos or beacuse they are not used correctly or because parents use them as babysitters all day long and don't interact with their children etc just looking for everyone's opinion hi christy i think you hit the nail on the head my daughter had a few of these we watched them together from time to time i would talk to her about what we were seeing do you see the blue doggie look at those hands where are your hands and so on she even started to speak some sign language which was amazing the videos are not to blame and probably are not worth what we pay for them but as a parent you try not to buy into everything you hear but there is this driving force that says what if my kid doesn't have or do this and then lacks in some way later on my daughter spoke early i have video of her at months saying things like bottle talk talk talk to your babies and read to them also ask them questions as they learn to speak to sort of encourage them speaking listen to them even when you don't understand them  Autism Baby Blues Second language acquisition Humphrey Bogart MTV Wheel of Fortune Sharon Tate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hearing impairment Milton H.

sahm's how do you spend your day with your children stay at home mom's i am curious how you spend your day with the children i am always interested how other families spend their time together what kinds of games do you play do you stay at home a lot or prefer outings how much tv does your kids get to watch any special bedtime rituals what frustrates you about your child just would like a run down of your day with your children maybe you'll have an idea of something i can do with my children thank you in advance for sharing at the moment i have children soon to be a year old boy a one year old boy and a one year old girl to be honest we don't do nearly as much as i would like to i know they watch way too much tv and i feel bad about it and i am in the process of weaning them off of it this pregnancy i am due in december has left me completely and totaly exhausted and my parenting is suffering because of it i think a routine is key for stay at home families not necessarily a schedule but more like a certain order that things happen if i had the energy i wish i had our day would go something like this i would get up at about to get myself showered and dressed before the kids wake up around diaper changes fix breakfast while the kids watch a baby einstein movie or something else educational eat clean up get the kids dressed then spend some time outside if the weather is cooperating or some structured play we would all play with musical toys or play 'store' with the shopping cart and groceries or build a fort or a tunnel with the couch cushions blocks or big legos inside if it's raining or cold around the kids would all sit in their high chairs and color or play with play dough something stationary so i wouldn't have to sit them in front of the tv again already while i fixed lunch then we would eat clean up change diapers and lay down for a nap at this point i nap with the kids i really need the extra rest but if i didn't i would use nap time to wash the dishes and pickup the toys then sit down with a book or magazine they usually sleep for about hours sometimes as long as hours when they woke up we would have a snack something healthy like fresh fruits or veggies and dip then we would change diapers we go through a lot of diapers and have some unstructured play time with each child doing whatever catches their eye i would use this time after snack and before dinner to go somewhere once or twice a week like the park or the parent resource center or a playdate then i would try to get the kids involved with something that would keep them busy for a half an hour or so a board game when they get a little older or coloring or music a movie if i have to so i could fix dinner daddy gets home just before dinner and the diaper changes for the rest of the night belong to him then we would eat clean up and try to keep the rest of the evening relatively calm we try to eat dinner all together at the table every night i feel that's really important for the kids to grow up with as a ritual and it's a nice time to re connect with daddy after dinner daddy plays with the kids while i wash some dishes he gets to pick up the toys after they go to bed around the babies get their milk everyone brushes their teeth then they all have a bath i take them out of the tub one at a time and they each get a rub down with the night time baby lotion lavander scented then into clean diapers and pj's then we read a book or lol and they get into bed around or as soon as they are in bed i try to finish up whatever else needs to be done so i can wake up to a relatively clean house most of that was what i wish i did with my kids like i said it will be easier to accomplish once i get a little energy back and there will be a lot more i can do with them when they get a little older i can't wait until they're old enough to play board games and do arts and crafts there are lots of books that have ideas for things you can do with the kids the toddler's busy book tv free activities you can do with your child i plan on picking a couple of these idea books up very soon good luck i hope i helped at least a little  Breakfast Infantilism Urinary incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Comanche Hamster Care Bears Breastfeeding Poker jargon Shaggy dog story The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Garfield The Family from One End Street Sento The Contender (television series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Textile manufacturing New York Giants Milton H.

how to motivate my years old girl to play she is always depend on me she will play if i am playing with her she will draw if i am seating near to her she will seat near to me in playground and she will watch tv all the time that i am waching and it doest matter what is that she doesnt whant to do anything herself she has brother y who is always can find somthing to play with and he wants her to paly with him but she is still so bored what can i do i cant seat ner to her and play with her all the time and i don t what her to tawch tv help it is not that she will cry without me she is very friendly but she doesn't whatn't to do things byherself my daughter was similar i think a good way to ease her into playing more without you right there is to slowly stop actually playing with her and ease into just being right there and then ease into being nearby and then ease into just being in the room etc for instance my kids are pretty good at doing their homework by themselves but they are much better at doing it on their own when i am right there with them in the room doing something else but being with them i am usually in the kitchen cleaning or cooking and they sit at the kitchen table they can ask me questions but i'm sort of busy but not too busy i'm not looking over their shoulder but i'm nearby if she will draw when you are sitting near her try sitting just a little further away and see what happens if she needs you to be drawing with her try starting out drawing with her and then stop and stay there and see if she will continue drawing even though you have stopped it's a process of getting her to slowly not care that you aren't participating quite as much and slowly she will be able and willing to do more and more as you do less and less  Kitchen Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Aerial (dance move) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Baroque chess The Amber Spyglass Silent Night, Deadly Night EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ben Johnson (athlete) Milton H.

what's the best way to potty train a year old as a mother of two kids one who is my advice would be wait until your child is at least and a half you will know when thay are ready if you try and force the issue it will not happen i believe if a child is ready you can crack it in a couple of days you will always get the odd accident just remember spare clothes when you go out dont try and rush the child as when it is an issue they retaliate and at they have enough emotions to deal with i find toilet training seats work better than potties dont all toddlers like to be grown up like mummy daddy enjoy them for what they are now and dont compare their progress with other children around you they are all individuals and get there in the end not necessarily in your time scale even if he is it doesnt matter if potty training hasnt been sorted good luck and stay clamand positive  Toilet training Kimberly-Clark Corporation Atomic Kitten The Fairly OddParents Recess (TV series) Housebreaking Phil of the Future Parenting Diaper Toilet Elimination communication Marriage Divorce The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Infantilism Situation comedy The Sims Mr. T Martial art Father's Day (Doctor Who) Japanese toilet Social rule Controversies in autism Breastfeeding Jennifer Lopez Good Times John Harrison Maison Ikkoku Fecal incontinence Train station The Family from One End Street Shaggy dog story 1984 Anti-Sikh riots Gender role About a Boy Niddah Human sexual behavior Poker jargon The Contender (television series) Luck Feral child Gun politics Urusei Yatsura Stroke F-104 Starfighter Emperor Yuan of Han Ethics Sin City GWAR The Notorious B.I.G.

my month old wont look me in my eye when i put him in my face but if i ask him where are my i eye he looks at me and says eyes or i he wants me to pick him up he says up and holds his arms up a looks at me should i be worried about autism because he wont look at me close up my sister said he just wants you out of he face or that could be intimadating him but what do you think i never said i was yelling i just tell him to look at mommy i dont yell at my son for any reason i don't think it sounds like autism if he is looking at you and requesting up then it sounds okay does he have a 'social smile ' in other words does he laugh and smile at things can you play little games with him and sing songs and have him laugh and look at you in the eye does he look you in the eye at other times when you are just playing and having fun and laughing if he does then i don't think it's autism some children just look away when a face gets a little close try backing up just a bit and see if that helps autism has a lot of characteristics besides lack of eye contact like the loss or lack of language i think your child is probably just fine  Autism Social rule Asperger syndrome Autism rights movement She Loves You The Ashlee Simpson Show Hall & Oates Highway 61 Revisited Time Out of Mind Avenue Q Autistic community Autistic spectrum Spidey Super Stories Controversies in autism Piccolo Junior Saga Unreal Three Stooges Shaggy dog story President (game) Neurodiversity Squidward Tentacles I Want to Hold Your Hand I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Treehouse of Horror V Milton H.

cild pros why will my yr old only sleep on the floor at the moment if moved he wakes gets back down up until a few weeks ago he would go into his bed sleep through without any bother but now insists on sleeping on the floor is this ok should i perservere in moving him or let him get it out of his system children can sleep in the oddest places it bothers us because it looks either unconventional or uncomfortable but if your son is getting the sleep he needs and shows no ill effects from snoozing on the floor there's really no problem the key is to remember the goal you need him to have a good night's sleep so that he'll be healthy and have the energy to get through his day it sounds like he's doing that it's almost impossible to figure out why he's chosen this sleeping place maybe he gets more light from the hallway and likes that maybe he finds the bed too big too high or too lonely he might like falling asleep to the sounds of his parents' conversations maybe he just tried it one night on a whim and liked it it doesn't really matter though because he is taking care of his sleep needs and will move into his bed when he's ready  Sleep Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Insomnia The Emancipation of Mimi About a Boy Co-sleeping Urinary incontinence Out-of-body experience Shaggy dog story The Amber Spyglass Mattress Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Catcher in the Rye Avenue Q The Big Sleep The Death Gate Cycle Sleeping Murder Sin City Apollo 8 Blankets (graphic novel) W.I.T.C.H.

how do i get my year old to stop wetting the bed at night and in the daytime i have children is about to be next month in september and i have a newborn who is three weeks old i have been giving my oldest daughter attention but not as much since the new baby has arrived because of the demand for some reason though ever since the baby has been home my year old has been wetting the bed at night and in the day time she does wet the bed sometimes but this is beyond she has wet up all her clothes and when i ask her why she just stares at me i get her up in the middle of the night she still wets the bed limit her liquid intake by i even make sure she feels important and a part of this new change by letting her help me i set time aside for her and if she doesn't wet herself i give her a treat but somehow she keeps on doing it i have tried everthing asking her whats wrong i dont know what elese it could be or how i can change this situation any suggestions sounds like you're doing everything you can to stop the bedwetting perhaps it's a temporary thing because of the baby could be she's trying to get your attention even though you're doing the right thing by making her a part of things the clue is that it started when the baby came home my guess is that it's temporary i know you have a lot to do and you need your rest but somebody needs to get her up at night this shouldn't last long best wishes and congratulations on your newborn  Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Kimberly-Clark Corporation Bedwetting Social rule Theory of conduct EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Avenue Q Jon Secada Dog training Pyramid (game show) Infant Shaggy dog story Childbirth The Apprentice 2 Milton H.

attention potty trainers haha for those of you who have or are potty training your toddlers right now what were the first signs of them being ready my daughter is months old and while i know that she's not ready to be in big girl undies and using the potty i think she's ready to start trying to potty let me give you my situation twice last week we went to get her up from her nap diaper was off and she was upset she didn't wet or mess in the bed but she had the diaper off yesterday i sat her on the pot and encouraged her to tee tee of course she didn't but she thought it was fun to sit on it so last night we tried again she didn't go and i didn't leave her on long enough either because it was time for bath so we got her down and i got in the tub to find the water was too hot she reached over to lift the lid of the pot daddy said no she does it all the time and secs later she tee teed on the floor what do you all think sounds like she is ready to know about the potty just not ready to pottytrain yet the important thing about pottytraining is the child needs to be able to communicate to you in some way that he she has to use the potty and they need to be able to get the pullups underware up and down themselves or atleast willing to attempt it if she does happen to go potty in the potty give lots of praise girls are usually faster about pottytraining good luck and make sure daddy is with you on the pottytraining thing too when she shows interest in the potty make sure he puts her on it just like you do and she will be pottytrained before you know it good luck  Social rule Customs and etiquette of Japan Shaggy dog story Elimination communication Teen Girl Squad Dog training Kimberly-Clark Corporation Housebreaking Infantilism The Emancipation of Mimi Textile manufacturing Jackass: The Movie The Chemical Brothers Milton H.

why do children drag around a favorite blanket i always wondered i dont have children so i dont know but i have friend son is four and he is still going around with it he goes nuts if he dosnt have it and her one year old daughter is the same is it something that all children do not all children do it but it's common it's a security device it helps them to feel comforted in unfamiliar situations it's roughly analagous to an adult fidgeting with keys in their pocket or picking at their nails or even crossing their arms it's a defense mechanism and there's no real harm in it they will grow out of it eventually or may need gentle weaning off the item  Breastfeeding Milton H.

what are some good ideas for flying with a year old in septemeber i will be flying with my year old son for the first time and it goes without saying that i am a bit nervous like all other year old boys my son is not a fan of sitting still for long periods of time my plans are to bring books movies and games for him with that said are there any other items i should bring or any tips or tricks that anyone can provide to help make this flight a little more enjoyable for those around us on the plane i've been flying internationally and domestically with my children since they were months now at least three trips a year are the children and i traveling internationally alone here are some tips and advice that have always worked for me and i hope will help you you will need to have all your son's documents in order it is a good idea to keep a copy of this notarized birth certificate with you if it is an international flight you will need a passport and possibly a visa for your son as well verify what travel documents you will need in advance to make sure you have everything you can take a stroller and gate check it this means that you will be able to use it all the way up until the time that you board and one of the handlers will take it and put it in a special compartment for you when you exit the plane it will be waiting for you at the door as well since your son is at the age where he has to have a seat i advise using a crs child restraint system because it is safe for the child especially during turbulence makes them feel secure is more comfortable for both parent and child and gives both of you the opportunity to relax a bit a crs is a hard backed child safety seat car seat that is approved by the government for use in both motor vehicles and aircraft in order to be certified for use on an airplane the car seat has to met the federal motor vehicle safety standards check the labels on the side of your car restraint for a sticker words will be printed in red for verification that your seat is safe for airplane use many airlines offer half price tickets so parents can be guaranteed that their child can travel in a crs device you should call your airline to ask for a discount and or ask what the airline's policy is for using empty seats for take offs and landings the best thing you can do to help with the ear popping is give your son a bottle or something to drink formula milk water juice it doesn't matter or a pacifier baby formula is fine to take and you are not limited to the amount you can bring aboard as long as your child is with you do not worry http www tsa gov travelers airtravel children formula shtm new regulations allow you to take beverages including water from home as long as they are less than oz or beverages including water of any size that you have purchased from inside the security area onto planes you can bring a limited amount of baby food onto the plane with you other good things to bring are just add water packets of food cheerios goldfish animal crackers dried fruit etc http www tsa gov travelers airtravel prohibited permitted prohibited items shtm save your money when it comes to buying water though because the flight attendants will provide you with hot or cold water or any other drink free at any time that you request no matter how many times you request it another trick is that if your son is not taking to the pacifier or wanting to drink gently rub his neck from the chin down to the chest several times this will cause a swallowing motion which will help with the ears popping make sure to pack plenty of things to entertain your son such as a few books toys a portable dvd player or a laptop with a few movies and one or two comfort things such as a favorite blankie or stuffed animal my children like to bring along their own coloring books a doodle pad their leap pads with a few booklets and scrap paper so that they can make their own drawings with and play games such as tic tac toe my daughter used to like to bring along a doodle bear when she was younger so that she could draw on that as well you might also consider going to the store and letting your son pick out his own carry on bag and a few inexpensive toys that will be used only once on the plane be sure to pick out a few toys without your son seeing so that he has an extra surprise when he opens his carry on don't be afraid to get up and walk the aisles with your son this will help to break up the length of the flight and let him stretch his muscles it's actually a good idea for the whole family to do be sure to pack changes of clothes for your son you will need this in case he gets sick spills something on himself or in case your luggage gets lost keep your diaper bag well stocked with plenty of diapers wipes ointments and other essential things baby nail clippers and scissors are not allowed though just remember the new regulating liquids gels and such and pack accordingly you can usually find travel size baby products in stores and they are wonderful for plane use if your son is still in diapers you should be respectful of other passengers and always change your child's diaper in the restroom they do have diaper bed changers in there although they can be a little small keep your doctors name and number with you also get the name and number of a doctor where you are visiting in case an emergency should come up it is a good idea to have a check up with your doctor before leaving to make sure your child is healthy enough to fly if he has even a slight cold the pressure in his ears during take off and landing even if you do the precaution methods could leave his ears aching for days after the flight most doctors recommend that if anyone is sick such as being stuffed up or already having an earache not to take the flight because of the potential damage to the ears i know my husband and other pilots do not work if they are sick because of this danger bring any medications that you might need for your son should he get sick or that he takes regularly remember that if they are not prescription medications the oz rule applies to them and they must be kept in a clear plastic bag do not give your son medicine with the hopes of it making him sleep this is not only cruel but dangerous as well keep your calm if you get stressed out your son can pick up on it and it will make the travel that much harder last but not least if help is offered to you take it try to get your older child to help from time to time as well if i can be of any more help or assistance please feel free to

i don't want to breastfeed forever my son will be one year in about three weeks and i am not sure how to go about weening him it took him and i about three months to get nursing down and now i am not sure how to go about stopping everyone else i've talked to said that their children weened themselves but i find that he is a bit addicted to the breast and i really just do it out of habit he is drinking out of a sippy cup and he will take a bottle when he has a babysitter but i am planning on going back to work and feel a year of nursing is enough i do love breastfeeding and will be a little sad when we won't have that time together but practically speaking it can't go on forever i've heard the longer you wait the harder it is can someone please give me some tips i am willing to go gradually but not willing to nurse until he is thanks in advance i knew i came to the right place for answers just to rest some concerns he is eating solids throughout the day and we have cut our feedings to about what they were it really is the night time and naptime that is the problem and how do i ease engorgement lettuce leaves your ideas so far are great and i will start on many of them in a few weeks probably not cold turkey though really for my own selfishness and not his not ready to cut the apron strings completely lol thanks again holy sh t i knew i would get a breastfeeding freak sooner or later lithiam seriously i never said that my son was addicted to breastmilk only that he is addicted to the breast just as a figure of speech since he doesn't always need feeding just comfort i understand the complete benefits of breastmilk but i don't think that my child should be able to lift up my shirt saying 'booby mommy' if i had asked this question when he was you would probably be b tching that i should wait til he's or or hell let's wean him when he's in gradeschool get a grip i'm a pro nursing mother who just had a simple question i'm not on here to be lectured by some breastfeeding nazi the longer you go the harder it will be i know this one there is no doubt about it if he will take a bottle and a sippy cup then give him these instead it probably will not be as hard as most are that wait longer and have breastfed without a bottle or sippy cup just tell him he has to take the bottle and cup when he disputes it take him and hold him similar to the way you do when you breatfeed and give him the bottle or cup babies should be broken from the bottle as well at one year so try to stick with the sippy cup as much as possible stay consistant with it even if he cries or it will set the process back majorly i had a hard time taking the bottle away i told them that the dog got it and took it away the hardest was nap time and bed time good luck and god bless also get a back brace that is all cloth that you can wrap around your breasts this will help them not be so sore and not leak milk only take it off during your shower make it as tight as possible this is what i had to do and within a few weeks they were not sore a bit  Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fertility awareness Social rule Pitaten Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Baby bottle The Amber Spyglass Futurama (TV series - season 5) Little Britain Childbirth EastEnders Milton H.

how do you get a yr old to go to bed at night i guess it's our fault for never starting him out with a bedtime but he was little and we didn't really think about it now he's and if he doesn't take a nap he'll go to bed at or but even if he takes an hour hour and a half nap which is required he lay down at least that long at daycare he is raring to go til at night he is always awake by no later than it's getting tough because my husband and i never get any alone time by the time our son goes to bed we're ready for bed too any helpful suggestions and no he doesn't eat candy all day or drink sugary drinks or any kind of pop with caffeine in it if any at all it's just a habit he has we had the same problem here is what you do you set a bed time and minutes before that time you start to settle him down don't let him play up until bed time with us a bath worked good right before then say goodnight place him in his crib and close the door with a monitor he will cry for about an hour maybe more but eventually he will go to sleep make this your nightly routine and by the end of the week he will not make a sound and just go to bed the first night is going to be very hard because he will cry but you have to let him cry himself to bed each night after that the crying gets less and less until one night you will both realize he is asleep one warning if you go in at any time during the night and he sees you it will restart the clock and you will start over with the hours worth of crying but once they realize you will not come into save them they will roll over and go to sleep we also left a stuffed animal to cuddle with so they had something to comfort themselves with good luck  Insomnia Pitaten Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Siesta Grandview, U.S.A.

year old throwing tantrums in store everytime i go into the store with my year old if something catches his eye he begins screaming for it at the top of his lungs and i mean loud and dramatically i have a new baby also so this is making things very hectic for me during shopping usually dad goes with us to help out but dad is deploying so i need to learn to cope with both of them together while shopping back to my two year old i have tried just about everything from ignoring him to spanking rewarding it has continued even worse now i had one friend suggest dropping everything i am doing to walk out to the car with him but that seems unrealistic due to having a newborn and not near enough time in the store in the first place i am in need of some advice on what i should do to get these tantrums to stop he acts fine at home and the tantrums are very mild as opposed to the ones in public the tantrums are worse in public because he is aware you wont punish him as much there i suggest getting a babysitter for shopping you should take some time off while your husband is deployed anyway hire a young girl to puch the children in a cart or to take them for a walk while you shop arrange for someone else to go with you a few times dad will do and at the first sign of tantrum have dad take him to the car for a few minutes until he calms down worse comes to worse buy the child a treat to munch on while you shop hes less likely to melt down over something else when he has something already patience soon he will start to be able to behave better in the store depends a lot on verbal abilities he will understand a lot better when you say if he is good he can get something if you have no money tell the children this is a free day they can be good for mom and she will give them a treat when you get home and he will understand it better an hour seems like an eternity to a and year old so an hour in the store must seem like a long time  Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct The Adventures of Pete & Pete Autism Infantilism Treehouse of Horror V Asperger syndrome Hearing impairment Dog training The Inside Microeconomics The Family from One End Street Social rule Mr. and Mrs. Turner Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Babe Ruth Breastfeeding Jam (TV series) Motion picture rating system The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Teen Girl Squad Garfield Static Shock Public transport God Emperor of Dune Calvin and Hobbes Unreal Married... with Children Shopping cart RuneScape quests Doug Child abuse Baseball Spanking Child time-out Tag London Congestion Charge MapleStory Charmed Avenue Q Friends Father's Day (Doctor Who) Fred Phelps Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Earth Girl Arjuna Free will Contract 2000 Australian Grand Prix For Better or For Worse The Apprentice 2 Scenes from a Memory Grandview, U.S.A.

could use some advice i just had paternity done and i am suppose to find out soon if i am the father of a year old girl that i didn't know about until last aug i would like to get visitation rights so i can get to know her if she is proven to be my daughter but at the same time i don't want her to get scared of me cause she has never seen me and doesn't know who i am i could really use some of your opinions or advice i think its great you want to know this little girl should she turn out to be your daughter every child deserves parents whether they live together or not i think you should take it slow at first see if mum will agree to meet at a park and spend a few saturdays getting to know her if she responds well step it up a notch to spending time at the park without mummy for an hour then you pick her up and take her somewhere then its overnight visits as she is older and better able to cope if you can help her make the adjustment over a mth period by the time she is she should be ready and willing to stay with her daddy without her mummy around her mum needs to help in this transition phase though because if she is being hostile towards you then it won't work and daughter will pick up on it and not want to be around you don't insist on just finding out shes yours and then demanding that every weekend she spend with you she needs stability and a transition phase so she doesn't feel scared but rather secure safe and loved it might be hard at first and but if you explain to the mother this sort of scenario i think she would agree as you are putting in time and effort to get to know her before spending time nights alone with her the mother is also going to feel that her daughter is in a safe and secure place with you trust is going to be a major hurdle but i'm sure you'll do fine good luck and well done for making the decision to be a part of her life  About a Boy Sin City Little Britain Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Avenue Q Maison Ikkoku Social rule Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Saturday Night Live Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Fathers' rights movement in the UK Mina Mongoose 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Yoko Ono W.I.T.C.H.

should i be worried i have a year old daughter who is obsessed with anything masculine she only has boys around to play with so i suppose it's no wonder that she only likes to play with cars and such not dolls she also likes to wear boy clothes and sometimes says that she's not a girl but is a boy i have allowed her to wear some boy pajamas but not everyday clothes she is very active and has played t ball soccer football karate and basketball in fact basketball was her first word she is very good at sports has been riding a bike without training wheels since she was three and excels in most everything my husband insists that she is just a tomboy and will grow out of it there are times that she wants to wear dresses but those times are becoming few and far between i'm wondering if anyone else has had experience with this when should i be worried thanks i think that it is great that she can hold her own with the boys i have boys and little girl who is also and let me tell you she can hang in there right with em lol my daughter likes cars karate soccer etc but she also enjoys her barbies and dresses i would probably feel a little sad if she wouldn't let me dress her up and paint her nails just because she's my only little girl she has her time being a tomboy but we also make time to do girly things together like dress up tea party's and such i wouldn't be so worried about this right now she is only and this is probably just a phase i have a cousin that was raised by a single father and i remember as a young child watching her dressed in overalls helping her dad work on lawnmowers and cars with greese all over her head to toe lol she loved doing all the boy things and now she is beautiful woman with a husband and a little girl of her own my opinion is as long as she is happy and healthy then let let her be who she want's to be you only get one childhood if she would rather throw a football around or play in the mud then let her  Tomboy Kodocha Sport Ranma __ characters Comanche Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Barbie Infantilism Friends Marilyn Monroe Little Britain EastEnders Pitaten Trailer Park Boys Shaggy dog story Sin City Urusei Yatsura Australian rules football Humphrey Bogart Characters in the Smurfs Kim Possible Azumanga Daioh Ghastly's Ghastly Comic Totally Spies!

help with carseat booster i have a year old and a month old they both have the britax roundabout but my oldest is about grown out of it i love the britax and also would like to stick to a point harness but have no objection to boosters either i was looking at the britax regent does any one have this carseat and what do you think about it what are some other ones that you recommend i would like something that i can get for my youngest now too i have the britax husky but they don't make it anymore the regent seems really nice i'd go with it i've tried graco cosco safety st and evenflo seats the britax is far superior all of their straps twist easily and don't seem as thick and secure as a britax seat however at age your son doesn't require a pt harness if he's over lbs he's too big for the latch attachment for your car and you need to use the seatbelt to secure the seat in your car i'm all for a pt harness but a booster's fine i'd get a high back booster as opposed to the backless booster as long as he's yrs old and lbs he's fine to use the booster seat if he's slightly less than that he'll be fine the boosters can be used at years and inches tall  Car safety Seat belt Textile manufacturing Dragon Booster Equine conformation Knife Paragliding Kitesurfing Horse tack Crash test dummy Baby transport Parachute Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Climbing equipment Skateboarding trick Carburetor Textile manufacturing terminology Yu-Gi-Oh!

parents of boys ok i have a yr old son and yesterday he was playing and he ran into the coffee table and he hit his pee pee he was in so much pain and crying and i could just see the pain in his eyes i started crying cause it hurts me to see my child in pain and my husband was just sitting there like nothing i yelled at my husband cause i would think him being a man that he knows the pain and he did nothing to comfort my son i was angry and hurt is it cause he is a man and he knows the pain and that it will be alright and did i just over react cause i am female and i don't know that pain idk i was just mad and was very sad for my son also what can i do to teach him to be more careful there well i didn't run to comfort him i was sitting on the floor with my daughter when it happened and he just stood there grabbing himslef crying and i started crying cause i could just see the pain in his eyes and my husband did nothing so i called him to come to me and i more like cried at my husband cause it hurt my feelings that he just sat there when i had my daughter in my arms and i thought it was more of a male thing and he should have comforted him i have seven children and two boys i think i would have jumped up and looked to see if it was still attached but i might even chuckle at that scene not in a mean way but just to distract the child from the pain and tears one thing i'm not sure you understand about male genitalia is that being hit in the penis is just like being hit in the finger its when his testicles drop in puberty then being struck in the testicles will make most men nearly pass out or be totally paralized in pain for a minute or two dont be too mad at your husband your boy will have countless moments of tears and pain as your husband has also had so you try as a man to not be a baby about it and just get through it in silence it is good to have a nurturing mom to tell you it's going to be alright but dont expect your husband to be that way its not in his nature as far as teaching him to be more careful there its the first time when he really gets nailed in the ba s he will never forget it and will always remember to protect that area good luck swequin  Jon Secada Shaggy dog story Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Milton H.

did my toddler have night terrors this has only happened nights while on vacation one night at my fathers house and one night at my house here is what he did woke up screaming crying grunting he was all red and his head would jerk each time he took in a breath i tried to hold him to comfort him and he just kept crying and screaming he would push me away with his arms after a while he would open his eyes kind of calm down then do it again for a while i could not calm him down eventually he opened his eyes and calmed down on his own and was really quiet for a while is this what children do when they wake from a night terror on all of the nights where he woke up like this he had not sleep his usual amount from naps it sounds like he was overstimulated with missing his naps and being on a vacation it is a combination of being over active and a bit of night terror but it was cause by his activeness of his days children like patterns bc they know what is coming next but because you were on vacation he didn't really know what was going on i will bet that when you get home he will calm down and go back to being himself i know because at times when my daughter was overstimulated by going to the pool then missing her nap would wake in the middle of the night screaming this happened twice on different occasions i hope this helps and good luck  Sleep Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Miss Saigon Poker jargon Futurama (TV series - season 5) Urinary incontinence The Shining (film) Pitaten Insomnia 50 First Dates Salad Fingers L__ Bu Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Siesta Blitzball Narcolepsy The Amber Spyglass Michael Garibaldi Jon Secada Hip hop collaborations Donald Neilson The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Contender (television series) Hansel und Gretel Sin City Tris Speaker Breath of Fire III Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an House of M Three Stooges Kodocha Hulk (comics) Rovers Return Lisa the Vegetarian Rapid eye movement Betting (poker) Babe Ruth Reservoir Dogs Sonic the Hedgehog Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Autism World Series AFI 100 Years series The Legend of Zelda series enemies Craps Scenes from a Memory Vincent Price Charles Bukowski Sukkot 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Inside Characters of The Sandman Lucid dreaming Time Out of Mind Scream (film) Waking the Dragons Piccolo Junior Saga Make Believe Jam (TV series) The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask characters Random Harvest Breastfeeding Bob and George Kibbutz Cleveland Indians Have I Got News For You A Night in Heaven The Sims Srebrenica massacre Swimming Mattress What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

yo points and whines to get something his mother gets him everything he wants but never asks him to tell her what he wants so he doesnt talk his mom doesnt give him to change and he doesnt need to at home at our daycare we are trying to get him use his words and that whining is unacceptable that he has to ask politely to now i know it will take time for him understand this new concept we brought it up to his mom and she said that he's just a baby he's should we be working with him even if his mom doesnt see that it's a problem what a crazy women she is i think you should still work with him to encourage him to speak thats a normal thing you do at a daycare centre so it doesn't need permission from mum but you could give her some information on language development to show her that children of this age are very capable of speaking if she realises that her child is behind others in his development she might take it more seriously it will be very rewarding to you if you are able to help the child start talking and very helpful for the child too if you can find something he is really interested in this can help him to want to speak because he'll want to talk about it hope this helps some good luck  Laura Schlessinger Kodocha Social rule About a Boy Thai royal and noble titles Day care The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Infantilism Atomic Kitten Baby talk Eric Cartman RuneScape quests Pitaten Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pok__mon Live!

how can i stop my little girl my little girl likes sleeping on her belly there for being months she stills wear nappies i change her nappie everytime she wokes up but most times i have change everything everything she has on and her bedding becuase she sleeps on her belly everytime she does a wee it goes right up her belly its getting to much having to keep changing her and i cant let her sleep wet any ideas on how to give her a dry night sleep no rude replys please the nappie im using on her is a boys and its the biggest i could get hold off seeing that she is months old you really can't change her sleeping style she likes her belly and there's nothing you can do about that as for the peeing you can do what the other gals have suggested try changing her diaper size or brand if you are using cheap ones sometimes using the more expensive ones work better maybe getting a good brand for night time you could also get ones designed for night time also cut the amount you give her to drink nothing to drink for an hour before bed and change her right before she goes to bed as bad as this might sound letting her sleep wet might be better than waking her up she probably wants more to drink and you being a good mom get her another bottle or cuppie this only adds to the cycle of drenched nights giving her less to drink before bed and letting her sleep through the night will actually encourage the dry nights she's only months so you have a while to go before she really starts sleeping dry you might be one of the lucky ones where she hates the wet so much that she actually potty trains herself like my little sister did she was about months i wish you all the luck in the world i know it's tough but you can do it i have boys that pee in every which direction my youngest is been potty trained for nearly years and still misses the toilet also you can try incontinent pads they come in disposable and washable types available at most health care stores if you can't find the disposable ones at your local walmart in the adult diaper department attends depends try the dog section they have puppy training pads they are the very same thing you could also get diaper inserts i don't know if they have them in the baby department but you can get them in the adult section i think they're called poise pads they're basically big maxi pads good luck  Diaper Urinary incontinence Kimberly-Clark Corporation Infantilism Fecal incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mattress Sanitary towel Sin City Jackass: The Movie Breastfeeding Humphrey Bogart Menstrual cup Social rule Toilet humour Genericized trademark Avenue Q Recurring South Park characters The Shining (film) The Fairly OddParents Japanese toilet Rugrats Knots Landing The Sims Wal-Mart Great Teacher Onizuka Urination Friends The Catcher in the Rye The Lovely Bones Insomnia Procter & Gamble Sleep Good Morning, Vietnam EastEnders Dog Trailer Park Boys Rooibos Housebreaking Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Subtle Knife The Adventures of Pete & Pete Fancy rat Daylight saving time Kimi Finster Ranma __ characters Public transport What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

generic brands what baby or toddler product would you never buy a generic brand of i use coupons so i have never had to buy store or generic brand diapers or wipes but i have nothing against it i nursed all three of my son's and i have never bought formula in my life if i didn't nurse my son's i would never buy store or generic brand formula i can't think of any baby or toddler product that i would never buy the generic or store brand other than formula i am good at saving money i can't think of one time that i didn't buy diapers on sale with a coupon or both i am fortunate that i have never had to buy generic brands for diapers or wipes if i didn't have a coupon then i bought luvs which i think is the cheapest don't get so offended about the formula if you read my question you see that i breastfed so i never had to buy formula name brand store or generic brand my son's are nine six and two and a half so this question does not really apply to me i was just interested in mother's opinions on this matter i used parent's choice formula and diapers with my son the only problem i found with the diapers was that they are short through compared to pampers or huggies i used zeller's store brand diapers and didn't like them at all i buy him store brand clothing if i like the look of it i won't buy generic wipes from anywhere i bought dollar store wipes before my son was born and the only thing there are close to good for is my hubby wiping his hands after using modeling clay i would never use them on our son's butt it is too cute to do that to i don't particulatly like the wal mart store brand toys they break too easily one thing i have to say about store brand formula is that all formula's have to pass quality inspection so there are not lacking nutrition in any way i realize that you breastfed and are not mentioning it to push breastfeeding on other's i just wanted to say that so that other parents using store brands for formula or diapers or whatever don't feel bad about it my son will be in the fall he has always been above the th percentile for height and weight for his age and aside from asthma caused from our last house he is healthy as a horse and strong as an ox no word of a lie  Breastfeeding Kimberly-Clark Corporation Infantilism Procter & Gamble Childbirth Wal-Mart Infant Diaper Inflation Nestl__ The Apprentice 2 Charles Ponzi Genericized trademark Knots Landing Human height Rugrats Alcoholic beverage Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Advertising Abortion debate Spanking Urinary incontinence Microeconomics Characters in the Smurfs Electronic commerce Commodore International Atkins Nutritional Approach Fertility awareness One Tree Hill (TV series) Gross domestic product PlayStation 2 Infant formula Bulk vending Pitaten Humphrey Bogart Adoption Milton H.

need ideas on how to wean month old twins off of their night time bottles we have tried many things already sippy cups with milk before laying down going to bed with a toy or blanket mixing water with the milk etc please help us they haven't used pacifiers since they were months old but we can't break the bottle habit at bedtime and naptime we recently went through a spell with my mth old daughter where she was waking in the middle of the night asking for chocolate milk and getting it from her daddy when this was just once a night it was sorta acceptable but it soon became two or even three times a night which was far from ok i eventually convinced my husband that we would have to stop as she didnt need it although she really wanted it and it was causing all of us to miss out on our precious sleep so we went cold turkey on her and the first few nights were very difficult we could just tell her no she would get breakfast in the morning and she would have to wait she cried for probably half an hour the first night then min the second less than the third and for the past few weeks she either has slept through or has come in to see us in our room pretty quietly and goes back to her own bed and to sleep without any problems at all i think she just wants to reassure herself that we are in fact still there in the room next to her i dont know if this would work it sounds like you've tried the gradual approaches and they havent worked can you stand to let them cry for a little while i really hate to hear my daughter cry but i realise at this age there are some things she shouldnt get no matter how much she begs for it my daughter does have a favorite stuffed animal that she sleeps with which really helps her to soothe herself i would probably keep trying to get your twins to get attached to something besides a bottle like a stuffed animal so they can cuddle with it while they drift off good luck  Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Insomnia Breastfeeding The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Mattress Breakfast Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sleep The Shining (film) Sin City The Star Wars Holiday Special Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Big Brother UK series 6 Apollo 8 Pitaten Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Romulus and Remus Milton H.

is it rude to tell your mom to shut up i normally am very respectful to my mom and would never tell her this but oh my god she is driving me nuts my son is we dont live with her i am a good mom to him and he is an awesome kid however she needs to put her cents in about everything you need to do this you need to do that do this do that what you need to do is blah blah blah believe me i know she means well and she is only looking out for him and me but i have tried explaining to her that i am his mom he is well taken care of but she wont stop she literally calls me every morning at to ask me did you feed him breakfast like i would forget she calls at least times a day and i am sooooo fed up she even came and broke into my house one day because i took my son to see a movie and didnt bring my phone in with me so i didnt answer calls in a row so she thought something happened and actually broke my sliding glass door what do i do this is very out of hand you must have a talk with your mother i don't think shut up will do if she thinks she has to tell you to feed your kid and she's literally breaking into your home when you don't answer your phone long enough to see a movie there is some kind of psychological issue going on with her because this is not normal healthy behavior ask her straight out if she sincerely thinks you will forget to feed him if she doesn't tell you to then go through her other behaviors and explain that the constant calling and for pete's sake breaking down a door are very inappropriate ask her why she feels the need to act this way you would be surprised how much people examine their own actions when forced to explain them to others if she just can't help herself explain to her that you will answer the phone to her no more than once a day you simply can't parent or even lead your life effectively if you have to answer the phone that many times a day that would make me go insane and she will be responsible for any damages she causes to your home one thinks of tough love in regard to children but you may have to use tough love for your mother and keep her at a distance from your life and your son's until she learns some boundaries  Shaggy dog story About a Boy Theory of conduct Cindy Sheehan Humphrey Bogart Social rule Laura Schlessinger Friends The Amber Spyglass The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Rich Mullins Rent (musical) Customs and etiquette of Japan Theodicy Sexual orientation Eric Cartman Evil The Smoking Room The Shining (film) Kodocha Human sexual behavior The Marshall Mathers LP Narcissism Muslim ibn Aqeel EastEnders Little Britain A Course In Miracles Charmed Grandview, U.S.A.

spoiling your child do you think spoiling your child is a bad thing i have a year old son and most of the time i buy him what he ask for but i always make sure he has what he needs first he is the only child so i can't help but to spoil him but are there any parents out there that spoiled their child and now regret it well i grew up without alot have you heard the saying dirt poor and worked hard to get college scholarships and worked and paid my living expenses through college while taking out loans for what i couldn't afford so initially i thought i don't want my kids to go through that i don't want them to ever have to worry about money and i just want them to have the things they want and enjoy their childhood so i bought them whatever they wanted had elaborate birthday parties and christmases by the time my son was five and daughter was they had everything they could possibly want and were getting bored now what they weren't ready for a jet ski or car yet i also see how things have no meaning after a while and the expectation of just getting things without working for them makes them feel entitled do we really want to raise kids who feel entitled without having to work what happens when they reach adulthood think about the masses of adults who are raised with that self centered mentality what is our society going to be like so i started making my kids do chores clean up around the house and help me out it was hard at first but it got easier when they reaped rewards i still give them a dollar a week for their ages ex year old would get dollars a week i think this has helped teach them that you have to work hard for your money nothing is given to you and they get really excited about that toy when they have worked hard and saved up their money thought about it and wanted it and planned for it and earned it even on three year olds or younger there are still things they can do like put the toys back in the toybox i hope this helps i want my kids to grow up and succeed in life and be hard workers that won't quit when things get tough i hope you do too  EastEnders Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Infantilism Jon Secada Knots Landing The Apprentice 2 The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Social rule Education in the People's Republic of China Justification (theology) Procrastination Capitalism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Contender (television series) Child The Fairly OddParents Tony Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) About a Boy W.

my son will be years old this month is legoland a fun place to take him legoland can be alot of fun for toddlers but be aware that the lines can get kinda long all it takes is one early meltdown to turn the day into a disaster for a two year old don't even bother with the more extreme sections of the park when we lived pretty close we got a membership so we didn't feel we had to do every ride every time if you can go on a weekday that isn't too hot and get there early hit the safari ride and the fairytale boats right away before the lines get too long try to get to the car track early on also cause i think that can be the longest wait in the back of the park the king arthur horse ride was a big hit the king arthur playground was great fun for the kids but kind of a panic for the adults as it is extremely hard to keep track of where your kid is unless you feel like following him around through the rope mazes and such i would suggest giving your son time to unwind in the playgrounds which are very well done though your parental instinct might be saying what i paid all this money for him to climb around in a playgroud it will ultimately be worth it you can take your time later in the day perusing the incredible lego world sculptures in the middle if its a hot day don't bother with the king arthur show it was rather boring as was the big fire show in the middle of the park but the puppet magic show near the kiddie coaster was good and i would suggest you don't try to visit every possible ride pick the five or six things he would most like to do and then call it a day before amusement park meltdown takes hold congratulations and have a great time  LEGOLAND Windsor Amusement park Roller coaster The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Lego Hersheypark About a Boy Milton H.

doe my baby send too much time in her bed shes months old the last months she has been sleeping close to hours at night and when shes ready to take a nap she actually takes me to her crib to put her down she will play in her crib for about an hour then go to sleep for about an hour to an hour and a half and then again in the evening for her nd nap i dont object to it for obvious reasons lol but im concerned that maybe shes spending too much time in her crib is that possible when she is up i spend plenty of quality time with her so she is definately getting enough love care and attention should i be concerned it sounds like your daughter is craving a little personal time kudos to you for getting this lucky with a child i watch my niece and nephew several days each week and we have appointed personal private time where they spend minutes alone in their rooms while i play with the other one it really helps them to calm down and get ready for dinner etc if your daughter does this before naps it's fine i wouldn't be concerned if you're worried ask your pediatrician about it or drop him her a line  Sudden infant death syndrome Apollo 8 EastEnders Sleep Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Time 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Rule of St Benedict Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding About a Boy Luke and Laura Spencer Narcolepsy Fertility awareness Co-sleeping Big Brother UK series 6 Insomnia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Phaedo Knots Landing Daylight saving time The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Fancy Crane Le Malade imaginaire John the Baptist Siesta Humphrey Bogart Avenue Q Dorama Futurama (TV series - season 5) Oasis (band) Planet Waves Melanie Wilkes James Hanratty Friends Shaggy dog story Blitzball Miss Saigon Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Polyphasic sleep USS Tunny (SS-282) Infantilism Big Brother (Australian TV series) Delayed sleep phase syndrome Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!

don't know what to do my son is months old and he will randonly come up and throw toys at me hit me and kick me i have tried putting him in time out but it isn't working my boyfriend the father has also tried saying no to him and putting him time out but when we take him out our son would be mad and start throwing toys at me and hitting me some more what should i do i don't believe in hitting a child so please don't tell me to do that this is to linda d i am not allowing him to do this if you spank a child then the child will only want to hit you more because that is what you are teaching him or they will grow up scared of you and no i do not want that to happen i want my son to feel free to come up to me and talk to me whenever he needs too well mom here's the thing your son is trying to communicate with you and there's a breakdown somewhere he is showing signs of becoming a bully and i'm guessing that's not what you want my friend has a son who was turning out to be a bully too and we talked extensively about it she read articles on line about it and talked to her ped basically she tried time outs she tried threats and even yes gasp spanking spanking was about the only thing that worked but eventually she realized that if she got really busy with him and just occupied all of his time and kept him busy busy busy then he wouldn't be so angry so she basically burnt him out with activity now he is a bit older and can communicate with language and things are alot better so keep working on the language aspect b c the base of this is he can't tell you what he wants but he sure does want it also don't be afraid to keep putting him in time out he needs to understand that you are sorry he can't have anymore crackers before dinner but throwing a toy at mommy is unacceptable now sit here until i tell you that you can get up thank you hang in there and stick to your guns let him walk all over you now and it will never stop  Shaggy dog story Kodocha Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart About a Boy Milton H.

my month old son doesnt talk yet my son still doesnt speak i am wondering maybe its because i am bilingual and am speaking languages to him he is giving signs of communication like pointing grunting and is saying only words which one of them is ''gimmie'' it is proven that being raised learning two languages does delay speech it takes time for them to process all the words and understand that many words mean the same thing they also need to figure out which words go with which language however once a bilingual child begins talking he is fluent in two languages it is well worth the wait delayed speech can also be the result of many other things such as hearing probs older siblings to do the talking for them or medical probs my son had delayed speech as a result of being tongue tied this means the skin under his tongue came too far forward and prevented his tongue from moving enough to make proper sounds this should be caught by the ped when they are newborns or even by a speech pathologist after speech evals a few hearing tests an ent finally found it in seconds when he was years old it requires a simple minute surgery in our case he was talking normally in less than a month to check for it yourself play a tongue game together see how far he can stick out his tongue see if he can touch the roof of his mouth with the tip see if he can curve it up or down can he touch the back of his teeth my son could do none of these things and at the time i didn't know enough to look for these things i suggest a trip to the ent for a hearing eval and a quick check of the tongue and probably a trip to a speech pathologist but it is probably due to the privilege of being raised bilingual  Hearing impairment Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Traumatic brain injury Stuttering Prostate cancer Multilingual Second language acquisition Australian Aboriginal languages Aphasia Hangul Sesotho language Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Languages in Star Wars Ice hockey Vowel Speech synthesis Hypoglycemia Asperger syndrome Chopsticks Autism Origin of language Phoneme Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Languages of France Poker jargon Stroke Snake Androgen insensitivity syndrome Manually Coded English Viterbi algorithm Milton H.

parents we have a year old son since he has been off the bottle at one year of age we have given him the soft nipple spill proof sippy cup now we are moving to a big boy cup during the day but at night he stilllikes to have milk before he goes to sleep help how do we get him off the sippy cup completely night time is the worst because i think he sees it as his comfort he loves his cup full of milk before he goes to sleep i hope this makes sense please help is he only having a drink before he sleeps or does he wake thirsty in the night i only ask as my almost yr old has always had water to drink if he wakes up thirsty and he drinks a lot i would never say he can't have a drink if he needs it if he is contantly sucking from a sippy cup it can be damaging on thedevelopment of their teeth same as thumbs and dummies pacifiers if it is a comfort thing maybe try something like this tell him about a week or days ahead that the sippy cup fairy is coming to take away the sippy cup because at his age boys are big boys and move to big boy cups mark it on a calendar and let him help you cross off each day and count down when she will come explain that she does not just take away his sippy cup but she replaces it with a very special gift go and buy something else that he will like to go to bed with a nice soft teddy of sorts that maybe he can snuggle easily into make it sound so exciting and special then when you do this you need to stand your ground if he cries for the sippy cup within a few days he will forget about the sippy cup just give him his bedtime milk in a regular cup at a regular time before he brushes his teeth good luck  Breastfeeding Shaggy dog story Baby bottle Tooth Mattress The Shining (film) About a Boy Avenue Q Hiberno-English Characters in the Smurfs Cat Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Dairy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Insomnia Care Bears Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Stanley Cup The Lovely Bones International League Humphrey Bogart Otello Coffee Battles of Lexington and Concord 50 First Dates Roxette Sleep Sola fide Drink 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Friends W.I.T.C.H.

would my yr old be affected long term by my occasional angry moods and frustration like everyone i get very frustrated with daily things ie chores why is baby crying spouse problems ect would things like occasional yelling or frustration mentally or emotionally scar a yr old in the long term i have a year old and a month old so i can definitely sympathize with occasional mood swings and frustration being a stay at home mom don't know if you are but i am is a hard thing and it doesn't get much easier into the toddler years but i have found that when i am about to blow up i try not to direct it at my kids it's hard especially when the year old pees on the carpet and the month old is screaming for the th time in an hour and if i do direct it at my kids and my year old seems affected by it i explain to her that i am frustrated apologize to her for yelling and give her a hug and try to calm myself down i don't think you are going to permanently damage your child as long as you're not being violent towards him her and as long as you let him her know that it was nothing that he she did that you are just frustrated good luck take a deep breath  Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Marshall Mathers LP Pitaten Piccolo Junior Saga The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Fairly OddParents Traumatic brain injury Electroconvulsive therapy Grief The Inside Father's Day (Doctor Who) Hypoglycemia Kodocha Jon Secada Asperger syndrome Ron and Fez Fecal incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Anger management Domestic violence Hulk (comics) Stuttering EastEnders Fruits Basket Procrastination Recurring South Park characters Characters in the Smurfs Jam (TV series) Rent (musical) Dog training The Adventures of Pete & Pete Blood (computer game) FLCL Ranma __ characters Bart chalkboard gags Infantilism Oh My Goddess!

my almost year old son likes to get into the litter box it's disgusting and i have done everything in my power short of duct taping him to the wall any suggestions thank you for all of the wonderful suggestions everyone awesome i would like to add a few things on here at first it was an open litter box and i thought that it would alleviate the issue if we got a covered one we faced it towards the wall and he turned it around and then eventually learned how to take the tabs off so that didn't work i really like the suggestion about pleasing him with different textures but i am afraid that if i give him something similar it will encourage him even more there is no place that is not high enough that he cannot get to he is a really tall little kid i do not appreciate being told to get rid of my cat because it's beyond disgusting i believe with a little effort we can work things out so thumbs down to those answers does he for sure understand that it's the kitty's potty maybe he's just going through a phase sometimes when a child is trying to figure out something he she will be preoccupied until the concept is worked out is it possible to make litter box maintenance a scheduled activity set a timer for a certain time when the timer goes off let your son assist as much as his age allows with the scooping wash your hands together and say no touching the kitty's potty until tomorrow when the timer goes off  Extreme Programming Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Poker jargon Saw II Genericized trademark EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Milton H.

i need potty training help i have been attempting to potty train my son who is a year and months old he sometimes grabs at himself when he has to go number one but i have to take him to the potty he wont go by his self i guess im looking for some tips on how to get a system going for myself and him cany any of you parents out there help children teach themselves dr maria montessori the key is to let him potty train himself whenever you go pee ask him he wants to go too if his answer is no let him pee in his diaper when he is ready he will not want to wear a wet diaper if his answer is yes place him seated on the adult potty seat facing the wall hold him until he learns to feel confident i filled a tiny cup with life savers and gave him one every time he pee'd i always followed that reward by saying grami is so pround of you by the time that cup was empty it was already habit and he didn't need a reward pooping may take longer my grandson potty trained himself in days note when the potty training began he picked out his own big boy underpants pull up were only used for naps and night time trust your child and have great expectations but do not be disappointed if he backslides he will want to please you i am the mother of boys grandmother of boy and it was my grandson who taught me the most about potty training he was initially potty trained at months but his parents weren't ready to trust his bladder so they put him back in a diaper they sent him back to me at age and he did it again  Urinary incontinence Diaper Kimberly-Clark Corporation Toilet humour Infantilism Fecal incontinence Elimination communication Toilet training Tupac Shakur Rugrats Housebreaking Montessori method Urination Language acquisition Shaggy dog story Mnemonic Kimi Finster Captain Underpants Little Britain Breastfeeding Jackass: The Movie The Fairly OddParents God Emperor of Dune Pitaten Menstrual cup Professional wrestling match types The Contender (television series) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Boy Scouts of America The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Friends Aerial (dance move) Emperor Xuan of Han Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Dog Comanche Norway national football team Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Son Goku (Dragon Ball) House of Bourbon Diving Paris Hilton W.I.T.C.H.

cheap easy ideas for a year old girls birthday party my daughter just turned and i am trying to think of a good theme that will be cheap and easy for her birthday party this weekend i've racked my brain and can't come up with anything help i did a fairy party for my daughter at our house we wrote on the invitation for all the girls to wear their princess dresses i ordered fairy wings in bulk from birthday express or oriental trading when the girls arrived i told them they were fairies in training we had a little scavenger hunt where they had to work as a team to find the clues so that they could earn their wings and become real fairies the last clue led them to the stash of wings the girls wore the wings for the rest of the party and took them home as favors we also made fairy wands as a craft a couple days before the party i bought a bunch of dowel rods from the local craft store and painted them silver and i used a hot glue gun to glue foam stars to the tips of the dowal rods at the party i let the girls decorate the stars on their wands i put glitter and shiny beads in bowels on a table and let them glue them on to the wands once they were done i sprayed the wands with a little sealant to hold the glitter in place they also took their wands home as favors my daughter loved it her friends had a great time and her friends parents loved that the girls got to be creative and make their own wands it was cheap because we had it at our house and didn't have to worry about the fees to rent venues etc and that way you're in total control of the food that is served etc we served a number of healthy options  Comanche Avenue Q The Inside The Amazing Race The Fairly OddParents The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Teen Girl Squad Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Magical objects in Harry Potter Spidey Super Stories Link (Legend of Zelda) Cardcaptor Sakura Ron Weasley Humphrey Bogart Upholstery Wand Paul Is Dead Rent (musical) Viva La Bam Negima Radio controlled airplane Neopets The Family from One End Street Shrek 2 Queen of Wands We Belong Together Table tennis I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Abigail Folger Prom Little Snow Fairy Sugar Storytelling Cosmo and Wanda My Little Pony W.I.T.C.H.

my baby will only sleep hours per day but acts tired all day long what can i do all the books and experts seem to say that the average month old baby needs about hours of sleep per day my month daughter will only sleep hours per day no matter what i do she sleeps hours of naps and hours at night also she acts sleepy rubbing her eyes yawning fussing all day long even within only an hour of waking up from a nap is it normal for her to act tired all the time i try to make her nap more often but she fights it and if i try to put her to bed earlier she just wakes up earlier and won't go back to sleep right now this is her sleep schedule am wake up for day am first nap pm second nap pm bedtime i hate seeing her so tired and trying to keep her going for hours between sleeps but if i put her down after hours she will fight the nap for another hour anyway if i put her down after only hours she will usually go to sleep but then it throws off the rest of her schedule for the day any suggestions i haven't started her on solids yet do you think she might sleep more after we start her on solids ooops i meant to put this question in the newborn baby category sorry i'll go post it over there instead while it is a commonly believed idea that eating solids will help a baby sleep more there really is no reliable evidence to show this to be true i think her sleep schedule sounds pretty normal and you must remember that when you read guidelines for milestones that the numbers are just averages all babies are different and if she won't sleep more or longer than it is not for her right now the fussiness with yawing and eye rubbing may not have anything to do with sleepiness but may be a sign of boredom or a sign of needing a quiet time even if she seems content most of the time in her swing or bouncy seat move her to the floor more often take walks with her either in the stroller or in a snugli or just go outdoors for a bit some babies are very social and like to have someone interacting with them a lot but may fuss rub their eyes or turn away when they just need a little down time the same can be true for babies who entertain themselves alone well some fussiness and eye rubbing my indicate they are ready for someone to pay attention to them now it takes a while and requires some detective work but eventually you'll be able to know what different signs mean from your baby i would suggest that you try changing her physical location such as holding rocking her putting her on the floor using a swing carrying her in a sling going outside somehow change her position first if you have been talking a lot to her stop for a bit or turn on a music cd for babies if she has been doing something quiet such as looking at her toys try something more active such as dancing with her singing interactive baby rhymes such as insy winsy spider patty cake or anything that you can help her hands body do the motions to read her lots of books if you don't already do that she will love the sound of your voice and the bright pictures it will help her language skills develop plus instill a love or reading it is also helpful to know that sometimes babies just plain are fussy and there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with them this is ok there is no need to always try to make your baby happy as it will be impossible to do if all her basic needs are met and she isn't happy with anything your try it is fine to let her fuss it out a bit in her crib you should be able to tell a mad cry from a hungry cry from a scared cry if not try listening to her closely she will have different ways of crying for different things she wants she may just need to get it out of her system with some fussiness for a bit each day many babies have a fussy time  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sleep Cat Shaggy dog story Social rule Milton H.

my toddler years is pinching kicking hiting and biting my two month old baby what can i do i am quite aware that her behaviour is normal and age appropriate and that she is jealous of the baby and testing boundaries she'll hurt him and then say sorry and immediately do it again i know that this is normal behaviour and that toddlers think it's funny for them to cause a baby to cry how do i make her understand that it is not acceptable and that it is sore i have smacked her put her in the naughty chair and corner pinched her back ignored it punished her by taking toys away nothing helps i know she'll grow out of it and the phase will pass but i cannot have her hurting her brother has anyone experienced this what can i do i have twin toddlers and a baby who is months i think that you may need to reassess the reasons for your toddler's agression sometimes toddlers hit kick and bite only as a way to relate to others also i have never seen a toddler that thinks that it is funny to make a baby cry in my experience they usually get upset when another small child is crying although the behavoir is age appropriate from your descriptions assuming that it just jealous or testing boundaries could be too simple it sounds like she may be looking for the attention that you give her when she is aggressive towards the baby you could try as someone suggested separating yourself from her when she is aggressive and paying special attention to the baby i found saying ouch that hurt we are not going to play with you any more and then leaving the general area gets the point across when you do use this tactic be sure to follow it up with something postive she can do to help you with the baby maybe throwing the diaper in the trash when you change the baby or bringing you something you need then be sure to lavish her with attention when she does the helpful thing the same way you did to the baby when she was mean another thing i have noticed with my kids is that one of my sons seems to frequently hit the baby when he is already crying i have a theory that he is actually trying to comfort him but gets kind of carried away so when he does this i try to teach him gentleness by modeling the behavoir with the baby and encouraging him to do the same with a doll until she stops the behavoir these are some of this things i have done to keep my baby safe first when the baby was little i never left the twins alone with him if that meant the baby spent all day attached to me in the snuggli so be it next as he got older and started needing more tummy time i would spend the time with him guarding him from his siblings now if i want to leave him alone i fence him off from his siblings we have a play yard that fences off about the same area as a 'x ' rug so either the twins or the baby can go in it if i need to run downstairs and get the laundry or something good luck  Milton H.

my yrold seems to have regressed to a younger age we are having a nother baby in a month and for about the last wks he has wanted me to feed him rock him hand him things he can get him self thankfully he has kinda stopped and became the little independent boy he is has anyone else experienced this yes and it's very normal it will be hard on him trying to understand that he's not the baby anymore expect him to try and get in your lap while you are caring for the new baby when i went into labor i talked to my kids and told them that i was going to be gone for a few days and that they were going to meet their baby brother soon as soon as baby and i were presentable my kids were the first ones in the door i gave them hugs and kisses then i introduced them to their new brother year old might not understand very well so you may need to let him check out your smaller belly let him visit you and baby at the hospital as much as possible when you go home have your arms free so you can give those hugs and kisses to your son it encourages him to understand that you haven't forgotten him and still care it's very hard to split your time between little ones but try your best let the older one help with the baby by letting him put the diaper in the trash getting wipes for you ect he'll soon feel pretty special and will start to take on the big brother role best of luck and remember it takes patience as he will need time to adjust  Care Bears Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Childbirth Infantilism Milton H.

my year old is displaying this odd behaviour help my little boy has picked up the 'f' word from the chav brats next door they don't play together but we can hear them shouting and swearing in their garden which means i have to whisk him inside everytime they come out anyway i explained to him that it is a very bad word that he must not say it and he seemed to understand but now he keeps coming up to me in tears saying 'mummy i said f ' we could be sitting playing together and he will tell me he has said it but in truth he hasn't becuause i have been sitting with him that whole time and he hasn't said a word the only way i can explain it is that it's as if he is hearing himself say it in his head and then he is telling me he has said it it sounds bizarre i know but he is getting very distressed about it i keep punishing him each time he says it but it's not working it seems a bit pointless when he isn't actually doing it to be naughty it's like he keeps thinking it and feels guilty for doing so and telling me about it i would appreciate any advice from other parents on this i feel like i am constantly telling him off all day for this it seems to come no matter what we are doing seems to come up i will try the ignoring thing today and change the subject when he does it and see what happens thanks for your help sometimes it's hard to see a solution for yourself when you're so close to the problem i feel terrible for telling him off now im going to give him a big hug and say sorry to my little angel thank you all so much what most of you have said makes a lot of sense i will put it to good use xx by the way when i say punishment i just mean the naughty step i never smack my little boy something similar to this happened with a friend's child if he's crying and feeling so tough on himself for saying thinking this your constant telling him off could be causing him to develop a little self asteem problem or by telling him off every time for this and punnishing him he may have decided that this is a good way to get attention from his mother therefore he keeps it up this does not mean you dont provide him with enough attention and love just that he adores your company and will do anything for more of it tell him the other children are bad boys he's a good boy and that's why you love him be effectionate and spend extra time together at this point where he seems to be having a strange problem try devoting more time to him and praising him alot more you may see an improved difference in his strange behavior dont punnish him and get irritated over him saying a bad word it'll only imflame the situation especially if like i said he does it for attention from his mother you give him that attention he'll seek more and use his method bad word more often definitly continue to keep him away from those brats  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct Milton H.

how do you make a boy stop playing with himself my son is and has been playing with himself for quite awhile probably since about age i let him do his thing or asked him to go in the other room but now its getting to a point where its too often for me i dont want to tell him not to but when were in public its embarassing when teachers friends family etc ask does he have to go to the bathroom because hes grabbing at himself and i have to explain to them no he doesnt how do you approach this without making him self concious about it i dont want him to have a complex but i also want him to learn to be respectful about it what to do with my kids i likened it to going to the bathroom there is nothing wrong with going to the bathroom but it's very private you can tell him that he wouldn't go to the bathroom in front of other people at the store or at school so he needs to touch his privates only in the bathroom or his bedroom start making privacy a routine in your home if you don't already make sure to close the door when you change or go to the bathroom and encourage him to do the same make sure he understands clearly that privates are private as long as you are respectful to him like it seems he will learn privacy not shame  Friends Rick Santorum Shaggy dog story Japanese toilet The Shining (film) Current teachings of Prem Rawat Buckingham Palace Blood Simple Infantilism Humphrey Bogart Milton H.

my mo is not sleeping through the night because his diaper is leaking i have him in s it is very hot here right now so i've been having to give him extra fluids so he keeps waking up and wanting to sleep in my bed i had just convinced my hus that it was time to end our co sleeping and my son slept a few nights alone in his bed he normally wears size diapers but the s were still not enough has anyone gone through this did you find any diapers that would hold up all night i need some sleep in a bed without a toddler who doesn't want you to touch him while he sleeps don't say don't give him liquid it's degrees warmer here than normal and we've broken heat records for the last days the house is not getting below degrees at night he's too little to go without liquid in that i thought i had remembered there was a huggies product for night time but when i went shopping i didn't see them i'll try wal mart nan i started to do that last night but i thought maybe it sounded crazy if he wakes up tonight i'll try it by the time i get in there to change him he is wide awake and mad lol i have to go through my night time routine to get him back in bed and most nights i'm just too tired to try plus i have school m f and i need my sleep lindsey if the house wasn't so hot i'd try that but he's very hot natured and he'd still be up screaming i'm using huggies but if i can't find the overnights tomorrow i think i'm going to try a pack of luvs if they don't work for him i'll just send them to daycare they change him every hours anyway mayasmom he's not developmentally able to put pullups on yet especially not in the middle of the night my bff's three yo can't even do that without some help i guess girls are able to do those things faster i agree with the diaper doubler if they don't sell them around where you are you can buy them online and also try the night time pull ups as they seem to hold more for my little boy through the night and he doesn't relaly wake up too often at night anymore and depending on the weight you may consider the good nights they're more expensive than pull ups but i think they're wonderful plus they have better odor control than pull ups i know what you mean about the heat it's been well into the 's this past week and if the pull ups and goodnights can survive a night after hydrating a kid for that then it's very well worth it i have found that pull ups do leak quicker than the goodnights though  Kimberly-Clark Corporation Urinary incontinence Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Jon Secada Futurama (TV series - season 5) Sin City The Shining (film) Slow Train Coming Bedwetting Miss Saigon Winning Streak The Amber Spyglass Aerial (dance move) The Emancipation of Mimi Avenue Q Billboard Hot 100 We Belong Together EastEnders Procter & Gamble Milton H.

how do i get my yr old girl to poop in the potty right after she turned we went crazy with the potty training and she was really starting to catch on then one night she was constipated and couldn't poop because it hurt we had to give her prune juice and put a pull up on her ever since that incident over a year ago now she has not wanted to poop in the potty we have tried everything we've sat down and talked with her telling her that she's a big girl now and she needs to poop in the potty she'll watch me and even tell me to push and we've bought a few really big toys that she can have when she poops in the potty she knows this because every time she pees she says poop in potty get toy and i repeat to her every time yes if you poop in the potty you can have a toy but you have to poop in the potty first a few weeks ago we even decided to leave her in underwear at night because she holds off until we put the pull up on her to poop but that just left about dirty sheets a night please help we have a potty chair which was a waste of money she never used it she has always used the seat on the toilet and it's not like she is going into kindergarden tomorrow she won't go for another years i feel your pain i have a year old that refuses to use the big girl potty she is my rd child and so far the hardest to train however from experience the time will come where they will make the decision and do it just be patient and do not force the potty thing all the time it will just become a point of contention for her i would put pull up's on her at night if she is still peeing at night there is no harm in that keep up the positive talk and a little bribery will eventually work good luck  Toilet humour Pitaten EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shawn Michaels Shaggy dog story Urinary incontinence Humphrey Bogart The Catcher in the Rye Toilet Kodocha Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Milton H.

help my yr old son is having elimination problems he wet's and soils himself often in the daytime and i do not know why he does this i have had talks with him but that has not worked i have taken him to the doctor and we figured out that he apparently holds it as long as possibble and has little accidents because of this but it still happens i have taken him to my therapist and she says he shows no signs of abuse that he seems psychologicaly fine he will be in months and i am embaressed that this continues to happen it is also expensive i have to buy him new underwear all the time because it is just too soiled to wash my therapist suggested that i make him wash them in a bucket as well as washing himself off in the shower this has been a horribble ordeal for me and him he makes an awfol mess trying to clean himself up so i usually step in to help i am absolutley sick of this does anybody have any ideas why he's doing this and ideas to deal with it please help this is complex to fix and takes much parental involvment as a infant and toddler was he constipated often did he have very solid bowel movments familiarize yourself with the term nasal fatigue older children who still soil themselves suffer from it your going to have to set times during the day that he must sit on the toilet and go the best time is after a meal because chewing and swollowing kick starts the digestive tract while you are in this set potty time mode you must alter his diet feed him things that will make it easier for him to go peas corn beans fruit veggies etc stay away from starches or anything white pasta alfredo sauces bread tortillas you may also want to add a childrens laxitive for a period of time but only after consulting your pediatrician as for the urination you must go back to basic potty training ask him every minutes if he has to go make him try to go at least every hour if he has a night time problem with soiling as well as daytime you must set your alarm drag him out of bed and make him try to go i believe if you stick to this for a month solid you and he will be rid of your problem it's alot of effort and trial and error but it pays off a child i cared for had this problem and working this plan his mother and i were able to fix it remember be patient with him this more than likely stems from sub concisous memories of painful bowel movements and or urination in his early years i wish you the best of luck and if you have any questions or need advice feel free to e mail me at isisrocca yahoo com  Fecal incontinence Hypoglycemia Coeliac disease Crohn's disease Japanese toilet Folic acid Breastfeeding Stomach cancer Housebreaking Diaper Hamster Milton H.

for anyone who runs a daycare either a center or private home i heard read somewhere that throwing up on purpose can be a behavioral issue is this true and what can i do about it to give a little history so you know why i'm asking i watch a couple pre school age boys and it never fails the one child vomits daily at lunch time i've done everything in my power to remove any reasons why he might be doing this smaller meals longer time in between meals etc and i'm at my wits end and am tired of cleaning my carpet and upholstry every day the little terrors are coming back tomorrow so any suggestions or advice are highly needed i'm about to rip out my hair or give their mom a week's notice thanks in advance i have spoken w mom she says he doesn't do this at home it all depends on the child but it usually means they work themselves up to the point of throwing up he could be getting more attention at home if his mom knows he throws up maybe you should try putting him by his self away others on hard floors he might not like being away from the others kids and stop hopefully this works  Laura Schlessinger Treehouse of Horror V Stomach cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Inside 1957 World Series 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Surveillance Tag RuneScape quests Ben Johnson (athlete) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Baseball Day care Aerial (dance move) Recurring South Park characters 613 mitzvot Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ultimate Spider-Man Jackass: The Movie Prostate cancer Shaggy dog story Hikikomori Kodocha Volleyball Breath of Fire III Blood Simple Jumpstart 3rd Grade Little Britain Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jiddu Krishnamurti Drowning The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Fairly OddParents Meal Toilet humour Avenue Q Escape from New York Glossary of partner dance terms Social rule Sub-Zero Futurama (TV series - season 4) Domestic violence Traumatic brain injury Belinda Stronach Poker jargon Korban Ron and Fez Tenshinhan Rent (musical) Boom Town (Doctor Who) Hard disk Phil of the Future Royal Assent Doug Sharon Tate Sin City W.I.T.C.H.

how do i get my month old to stop pulling hair my month old son loves pulling hair not his own but everyone elses he tends to do it when he's in playful mood so i think he thinks he's playing problem is he does it to my friend's children makes them cry i scold him for it once or twice he's cried over it but then he still does it i tried ignoring him when he does it to me or distracting him but he just pulls harder what should i do when it comes to pulling other children's hair i would start by telling him that the kids won't want to play with him if he pulls their hair if that doesn't work then i would have the child who has had their hair pulled be asked to pull your son's hair i know it sounds cruel but i actually put this into practice once and it worked i was babysitting a little boy and he pulled my older son's hair my son was older by about years and although i had told the little boy previously that the other kids wouldn't want to play with him if he pulled their hair he only seemed to remember that for a short while so on the next occasion i said to my son to pull the little boys hair lol my son was horrified and didn't want to do it but i said to just do it softly so that the other little boy could see what it felt like my son did it the little boy looked extremely surprised cried for only a minute but it seemed to get through to him because he never did it again when he does it to you i would tell him he is hurting mummy and if he continues to do it that mummy will have to put him down if you are holding him or that mummy is upset and needs to be on her own for a few minutes remove him from your immediate 'space' each and every time he does it to you he needs to know that it is not a nice feeling and that you won't accept him doing it to you and that when he does do it to you that you don't want to be around him i know that is a hard thing to get across to someone his age but if you continually put him down remove him from your lap or you leave the room when he does it i think he will understand that you are not going to continue to allow him to do it good luck to you it's awful when our children begin anti social behaviour but you have to 'nip it in the bud' as soon as possible  Kodocha Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Pitaten Theory of conduct Piccolo Junior Saga The Shining (film) Social rule Humphrey Bogart Blood on the Tracks Time Out of Mind Tenshinhan Knots Landing The Inside The Contender (television series) Milton H.

at what age should i separate my kids into own beds room do you own twins boy girl twins or irish twins like myself my kids are months apart in age they slept in their own rooms until this recent move in late april may they are yrs old boy and girl they refuse to sleep in separate rooms much less diff beds they sleep in a double bed and since they actually hate touching ea other i have the bed turned so that they sleep in it horizontally so it is wider and shorter but since kids they don't notice the length and have a body long pillow down the middle so they won't bump into one another cos they hate that however they won't sleep alone no matter what i try is this weird and at what age do you think i should 'make' them sleep alone i mean they see mommy n daddy sleep together so it has to be hard on their brains to understand why they have to sleep alone parents of siblings only respond or will get a thumbs down omg i only now reread question and saw i typed 'own' twins omg not what i meant please don't osterize me i meant 'have' wow thanks for sooo many great answers and responses have made my husband esp feel better he slept in same bed w his brother for years and has of them so this was really his 'concern' i know an old friend that lived in subsidised housing and had many kids and she wasn't allowed to let boys sleep in same room as girls etc but yet lived virtually free those who dont have that have to make kids share rooms however i live well off it is just mine want to share anyway to one who asked what 'irish twins' are it is when having siblings or less months apart common in ireland catholics ideally in the same year say had a baby jan rd and birthed another baby anyways this is going to be hard to choose best answer lol that's kind of funny because that's the first thing i noticed own hehe i wouldn't have ostrasized you just teased a little lol well in my opinion i think it is probably appropriate until they notice a difference and become uncomfortable i gave my son and daughter baths together until they started asking questions about eachother ect i think there is nothing wrong with it at this age especially as they are comforted by eachother's company i like to encourage closeness anyway  Friends Milton H.

how to stop a year from picking his nose thanks to a gym daycare for hours a week our year old has picked up the nasty habit of nose picking at first it was just inappropriate but now he's picking it to the point where his nose bleeds make it inappropriate and unhealthy any ideas we've called his doctor and she's basically told us nothing helpful well you shouldn't have to worry unless it bleeds uncontrollably for a few hours two things we don't believe in smacking especially fingers love the band aid idea it apparently doesn't hurt him to pick his nose until it bleeds while i understand all kids pick their nose this is getting way out of hand my friend's daughter did the same thing her husband put a big old bandaid around their little girl's finger so she couldn't get it up there eventually the behavior stopped they basically had to keep catching her and they'd give her a short time out it's absent minded behavior and from what my friend was told by their pediatrician they had to keep drawing attention to it until the little girl stopped the other thing they did is that once she went a whole day with no picking she got a very nice treat eventually they stopped treating her for not picking because the behavior was over but they found something else to give treats for our big problem has been to get our year old son to stop scratching mosquito bites as they were starting to infect so we used a similar approach but didn't put anything on his hands i made sure his nails were kept very short and used time outs and rewards it has worked wonderfully he now catches himself scratching and immediately comes to get something put on the bite ps i have to disagree strongly with both of the other posters for one picking can damage the nose lining and cause infections it does not help a child breathe as to putting hot stuff on the fingers hello the child can rub his eyes i don't agree with slapping the child's fingers hitting isn't the answer and no i'm not anti spanking but if a parent is going to be vigilant enough to catch the behavior to slap the hands the parent can use other methods of discipline you can make him stop it's a matter of working at it it's causing nose bleeds so it's a problem and it may not stop just because other children stop my girlfriend's brother picked his until he was and he ate it too remember kids like that some behavior you can ignore some is just dirty i can't believe folks are saying just let him do it if he played in the toilet would they say just let him do it two year olds try that one too  Dog training Milton H.
