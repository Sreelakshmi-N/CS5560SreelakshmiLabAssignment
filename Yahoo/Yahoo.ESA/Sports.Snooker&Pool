uk pool players are these rules ok this selection of pool rules i have disagreed over but should be ok given consensus they differ from epa and world ball rules but i want to establish if these issues are common in the pub or snooker hall what is preferred and what sources if any can back me up after a foul the incoming player gets an extra turn and still carries the extra turn following any additional shots won by potting some claim the spare turn only applies if the first shot is not potted a player on the black isn't awarded a spare shot following a foul by his opponent if the foul is deliberate he wins the white is only repositioned if in a foul it is potted or leaves the table in that case it should be positioned inside the d some say it can be positioned behind the line either way it can then only be shot forward if the cue ball rests on another ball it must be shot away from the ball in question shots where the cue ball jumps over other balls are fine the cue ball can be repositioned if you are foul snookered even though the cue ball remains on the table push shots are allowed jump shots are only allowed if your snookered the white ball goes behind the line and your only allowed to shoot forward unless by doing that you cant see all of one of your balls in which case you can move it anywhere spare shots are still awarded on the black aslong as other object balls remain on the table there the rules everyone in my local club plays  Billiards Water polo Rugby union Volleyball Football (soccer) Table tennis Nine ball Poker jargon Ice hockey Basketball Tennis Betting (poker) Pinball American football Beer Pong Winning Streak Baseball Cricket Free throw Jimmy White Big Break Field hockey Backgammon Glossary of American football Golf Croquet Rugby union positions Racquetball Canadian football Internal ballistics Squash (sport) National Football League Personal foul Badminton Fast bowling Rugby league Tai shogi Dai dai shogi Draw poker Four square Australian rules football Fischer Random Chess Mark Williams (snooker) Rasheed Wallace Glossary of partner dance terms Dog agility Scrum (rugby) Professional wrestling aerial techniques Pot Black History of rugby union Items in the Metroid series Candlepin bowling Ko shogi Golf club (equipment) Harrow Football World Snooker Championship Japanese tea ceremony Shogi Tenjiku shogi Floorball Taikyoku shogi Table football Geoff Hurst Football (soccer) positions Professional wrestling match types 2004 World Series Draughts Canasta Arimaa Guilty Gear Counter-Strike Texas hold 'em Tackle (football) John F.

finally lost a game in indiana next stop california r ball clubs please so i finally lost a game on my us trip at nevada bobs in bloomington i was talked out of it possibly jet lag catching up with me i did come from ireland but hey i ain't crying i've won every other game i'm rolling into california soon so top clubs lay them on me the difference between a professional and a top amateur has a lot to do with being honest with themselves a good player will recognize when they are jet lagged and adjust their game accordingly they may play a more conservative game they may pass up on a shot that they might usually try and play a good safety instead the amateur player will use jet lag as an excuse for losing i'm not trying to lay into you but i don't want you to fall into that trap you're better than that incidentally when you say game do you mean match how many games do you play in a match or do you just add up the money at the end of the night to determine the winner i'm just wondering if you're doing this for money or to beat people let me know if you'll be in the wisconsin area anytime on your trip again best of luck m d bca instructor referee  Rugby union Golf Football (soccer) Norway national football team Cincinnati Bengals Snooker World Series Billiards Tennis Jack Charlton The Football League American football Australian rules football Eight ball Poker jargon Paintball English cricket team History of Test cricket (to 1883) Ice hockey Hulk Hogan Super Bowl XXVII Winning Streak Bryan Robson Sydney Riot of 1879 Paul Morphy Cork City F.C.
