integrated fridge freezer ok i've searched the net and found nothing so i need an expert to tell me what to do here i've just fitted an entire kitchen and feel like a complete fool that something which seems so trivial is stopping me completing it but we've bought an integrated fridge and freezer which has the little screw points on the front door which look like they are supposed to act as spacers i've also got doors the right size to fit so how do i fix the door to the fridge there has to be a better way than just glueing it hi you should have with the appliance a set of plastic probably fittings one part fits to the appliance door and the other to the unit door this allows the appliance door to open at the same time as you open the unit door this way you dont have to open two doors to access the fridge obviously you don't want to fit this assembly to the freezer section if the appliance is combined fridge freezer otherwise everytime you open the fridge then the freezer door opens also if it is a separate fridge and freezer then the process is the same for both the part that fits to the appliance door is static fixed and it slots into andslides along the part fitted to the unit door it is imporatnt to ensure that appliances are properly positioned in relation to the doors and units otherwise the appliance door can sometimes fail to seal properly i hope this is clear  Refrigerator Screw BS 1363 Glossary of firefighting equipment Hash table Bong Spontaneous human combustion Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Floppy disk Freezer Sento CPU design Dental brace Poker jargon Drill bit Violin National Electrical Code (US) RISC Thermostat Manifold Domain Name System Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Carburetor Appliance Fuse (electrical) The Brady Bunch Vehicular cycling Sears Holdings Corporation Species Upholstery Genericized trademark Electrical wiring (UK) Tire John Bull (locomotive) Domestic water system Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Seismic retrofit Washing machine Dentures Ground and neutral Station wagon Elevator Construction Natural Selection (computer game) De Lorean DMC-12 Stage lighting Integrated circuit Black Mesa Research Facility Artificial neural network Common electrical adaptors in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom Redundant array of independent disks Cross-country skiing Badminton Lock picking Burglar alarm Basement Screwdriver Weight training Window Combine (Half-Life 2) Glossary of climbing terms Boat building RuneScape quests Betting (poker) M60 machine gun Unicode Protoss Strap-on dildo Internal ballistics Atari 8-bit family Patent Field-programmable gate array Product Lifecycle Management Bike lane debate Radio controlled airplane Bristol Grammar School Java programming language Plastic Dairy School bus Virtual memory Circuit design View camera Freezing The Star Wars Holiday Special Carnivorous plant Visual Basic TARDIS The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Food processor Sailing Fuzzy logic Wrench Burglary Enterprise application integration Organic food Clinker (boat building)

hot water out of the cold tap i asked this question awhile ago but now i think i've narrowed it down and need some more specific information we have never had cold water from our cold taps it has always been at best tepid sometimes almost hot i have looked at several probable causes and think i have it narrowed down but need help on what to do to fix it when the taps in the house are all turned off the cold water inlet pipe on top of the water heater is cold when we turn on any cold water tap in the house you can immediately feel the cold water inlet pipe begin to get warm i am assuming that there is some kind of siphoning going on drawing hot water into the cold water pipes is there some kind of valve that i can install in the cold water pipe to prevent the hot water from entering oh yeah its an electric water heater about years old we had the same problem with the original water heater thanks for your help you can purchase an anti syphon valve install it on the cold water inlet on the hot water tank to stop this back flow the pressure drop at the open tap cause the pressure in the tank to try to equalize thus causing back flow if you have trapped air in the water heater it will act like a pressure tank on a water well pump check for trapped air by opening the safety valve only if you have the discharge plumbed to the outside or a drain good luck  Siphon Carburetor Thermal power station Solar power Flush toilet Glossary of firefighting equipment Tap (valve) Furnace Thermostat Ocean thermal energy conversion Autonomous building Irrigation Two-stroke cycle Water heater HVAC Plumbing fixture Jet engine Brewery Fire hydrant Three Mile Island Bong Dam Steam engine Hydraulic ram Hydraulic machinery Pump Rebreather Rail terminology Turbocharger E85 Water hammer Diving regulator Apollo 13 Fossil fuel power plant Glossary of firefighting terms Sewer Novelty (locomotive) Newcomen steam engine Vacuum tube Heat Carbon dioxide Basement Four-stroke cycle Snorkel Cruising (maritime) Diving suit Water supply Hydropower Dodge Neon Samovar Turbojet Air conditioning Poker jargon Drowning Canal lock Radiator Turbofan Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Space Shuttle external tank Water turbine Kitchen Hot air balloon Apollo Command/Service Module Steam locomotive nomenclature Soldering Home repair Gas compressor Stirling engine Axial compressor Water organ Central heating Fire fighting Scuba set Sewage treatment Eldfell Nuclear power Seismic retrofit Chevrolet Corvair Motor oil Welding Refrigerator Transformer Sento Energy development SR-71 Blackbird Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Water Glossary of wildland fire terms

i have a leaky window in the front of my house the front window leaks when it rains really hard and i was wondering if anyone knew how i could fix it also i am not if it is only the window it does it every once in a while and the water comes out of the bottom of the base board the caulking around the window is probably dried out i would get some caulk and a caulk gun a simple tool not a real gun and run a bead of caulk where the window casing meets the house don't pay attention to mj your house is not going to burn down the reason i know it is not the roof is because all houses have an overhang so the roof leak would have to be a couple of feet back from the edge of the roof the window probably only leaks when the wind is blowing the rain against that side of the house you should try to fix it because the water inside the wall will wet the insulation if there is any and mold could form  Geodesic dome Basement Glossary of nautical terms Window Straw-bale construction Seismic retrofit Soldering Passive solar Insulation Asbestos Thermal power station Air conditioning Architecture of the California missions Casting Plame affair Boat building Deck (ship) Autonomous building Shotgun house Diving suit Wood carving Campfire Tire Glossary of firefighting equipment Light-frame construction Vinyl roof Roof Home repair Fan (implement) Noah's Ark Electrical wiring Drill bit Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Lake District Glossary of climbing terms Fire fighting Door Glossary of firefighting terms Internal ballistics Spark plug Strap-on dildo Hamster Sento Windows XP Kitesurfing Syphon Filter Guns N' Roses Solar power Precipitation (meteorology) Wildfire Wrigley Field Molding (decorative) STS-114 Xanadu House Irrigation Natural building SS Morro Castle Timber framing Blood Simple USS Tunny (SS-282) Circuit design Glass Mud People Karl Rove Carnivorous plant Skateboarding trick Bicycle brake systems Collyer brothers Transformer Diving Jon Secada Car body style Rail terminology Volleyball Windsurfing Aztalan State Park, Wisconsin Furnace Knife ITunes Naval mine Windows Vista The Empty Child Sin City Climbing equipment AmigaOS Microsoft Windows Mattress Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ice Escape from New York Stage lighting Naruto jutsu Fenway Park Supercell Anemometer Cruising (maritime) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Hurricane Rita Rigging

another laminant question i need to know how prepared does my tabletop need to be prior to re laminating it with the pre glued heat activated new laminant this table is probably pre and appears to have had the orig laminant applied with hide glue i have removed this original laminant but there is still a bit of the laminant backing firmly attached and i have made several minor gouges in the table surface when removing the orig laminant i plan to use wood filler on the deeper gouges and to lightly sand with a hand sander or perhaps by hand the surface of the table prior to re laminating now my question is this just how smooth ie perfect does this table top need to be keeping in mind that the laminant i will be using will most probably not have a very thick backing i really want to do this right and i'm willing to work on the table top until it is as smooth as the perverbable baby's butt but if i really don't need to expend this energy i'd rather not recommendations please thanks if you sand it too smooth then the glue wont adhere properly hide glue is some nasty stuff heat will soften it but it does cool quickly maybe try using a solvent based thinner like lacquer thinner or acetone the easiest thing to do i think is to put some gt sand paper on a sander either a jitter bug or an orbital grind it off with the digs and divots the best thing to use is bondo it drys hard and stays hard using putty wont work cause it cracks and its brittle when you apply the new laminate make sure your iron is hot and press firmly and use a laminate roller to get it smooth you can purchase at home depot happy laminating  Woodworking Drill bit Glass Casting Brazing Pottery Upholstery Welding Printed circuit board Table tennis Plastic Seismic retrofit Leather Radio controlled airplane Equine conformation Table saw Knife Mattress Volleyball Paint Explosive material Hamster Cast iron Soldering Sand casting Manifold Japanese tea ceremony Parquetry Horseshoe Printmaking Stucco Boat building Adhesive Drawing Hand grenade Friction Guqin Nacre Piano Opportunity rover Combine (Half-Life 2) Tofu Sphenoid bone Repouss__ and chasing Strap-on dildo Coffee Cello Iron Textile manufacturing Sandpaper Cross-country skiing Tire Carnivorous plant Transformer Brewery Fire fighting Manicure Gas metal arc welding Campfire Screw Internal ballistics Enceladus (moon) Dairy Ramen Impact crater Laser engraving Aerial (dance move) Powder metallurgy Aluminium Spark plug Skin Chisel Disc brake Metallurgy Poker jargon Frontal bone Solar cell Tank Steel Spider The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Water M16 (rifle) Lacquer Electrophysiology Guitar Mouse (computing)

can i use florcent bulbs with a dimmer switch short answer is no there are some special florescent fixtures that you can use with dimmers you can sometimes buy special ballasts to replace those in standard fixtures that will allow for dimming also some of the compact florescent bulbs will work on a dimmer they are harder to find and you do have to check to make sure even with these special ballasts or bulbs some dimmers will not work so you have to check the requirements there as well these options are generally expensive and do not give off the same amount of light as a standard florescent at the same wattage  Lighting Dimmer Stage lighting Incandescent light bulb Fluorescent lamp Compact fluorescent lamp Headlight Bicycle lighting Light-emitting diode Reef tank Electrodeless lamp Mercury-vapor lamp Transformer DMX (lighting) Light switch Pulse-width modulation Strap-on dildo X10 (industry standard) Light pollution Street light BASIC programming language History of street lighting in the United States Clifford algebra Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Diablo II: Lord of Destruction System/34 Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Houseplant Color temperature Pickup truck Wayne Corporation Poker jargon System/36 Floppy disk Switch Slide rule Windows 2000 Crossword Airbus A380 Aluminium Cannabis cultivation Traffic light Rotor machine Diode Rail tracks Quiz Call Railway signal Embedded system Digital photography Oxygen sensor DVD Taikyoku shogi Windows XP Wheel of Fortune Vacuum tube Ethernet CPU cache Lightbulb joke Handloading Betting (poker) Amstrad CPC Sail-plan Elevator Dim sum Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Electric motor Lattice (order) Bus models used in New York City Transit Toyota Prius Sailing ballast Modem Halting problem Dual gauge Tri-Stat dX Pocket cruiser Draw poker Prostate cancer Lithic flake Mutual fund Leica United States Postal Service Compact disc Enterprise content management Rail terminology School bus I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Stomach cancer Onion Nonblocking minimal spanning switch FairTax Monetary policy Gramophone record Predictive dialer The Amazing Race Screensaver Compact audio cassette Binoculars Drag racing Tire

i want to build a wall to replace a door in my basement foundation wall i have a house with a set of stairs that someone dug to get into the basement the wall of the basement was broken through and a door was added i want to replace the door with cinder blocks and fill the stairwell in i had the same problem in my attached garage i hired a company to fill in the stairs and build a wall to fix it but at i can't afford to do that again even if i could the job they did wasn't that great as i had to support the framing myself after they said they were done the foundation is still under the door and solid my thought is to drill some holes add some rebar and build a wall am i crazy thanks not sure why exactly you would want to close this door off it would be great access for bigger items that you would want to store also being that if this is a basement where your furnace hotwater heater or even washer and dryer is that if these need to ever be replaced or if you move that getting them through a normal entry door would cause havok if you still want to for whatever reason it will take little more than basic knowledge you want to match up the brick the best you can remove the door clean area well take sill sealer avaliable in concrete isle of home improvement store using construction adhesive glue the sill sealer on bottom of door mix some mortar and lay a starting row of mortar on top of sealer llayout your bricks using a level and level it out on next row apply about of mortar on brick apply next brick keep going up about bricks up you might want to stop to let the previous mortar start to set once the bottom is set you can continue up caulk any wide caps with a bituminous caulk let set up then apply a sealer damp proofing to the exterior brick let dry then add nd coat im not sure what the stairway is filled with but if its concrete then you can just fill in with dirt add ' of dirt then compact continue every ' if the stairs is wood remove them then fill in dont pour dirt over wood add enough dirt and taper it down to allow water to glide away from house apply top soil and plant grass or however your going to finish it off  Masonry Stairway Light-frame construction Upholstery Casting Air-raid shelter Architecture of the California missions Concrete Hamster Poker jargon Mortar (masonry) Cinder block Thermal power station Natural building Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Chatsworth House Kitchen The Brady Bunch Pavement (material) Textile manufacturing Dam Mattress McMansion Dairy Motor oil Combine (Half-Life 2) Stave church Clinker (boat building) Screw Anchor Bungalow Glossary of firefighting equipment Passenger car Door San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Geodesic dome Pile Building material Fire fighting Timber framing Stucco Volleyball Boat building Arlington House Rathfarnham Antioch, Pisidia Elevator Wrigley Field Fancy rat Wood carving Glossary of firefighting terms Aztalan State Park, Wisconsin Adhesive Professional wrestling match types IPod Adobe Boulder Dash CPU cache Pottery Indianapolis 500 St Albans Cathedral Piccolo Junior Saga Refrigerator Irrigation Chimney Bristol Grammar School Paint Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Orthogonal matrix Drainage Big Dig Japanese tea ceremony Christiansborg Palace Hard disk Wood M16 (rifle) Passive solar Campfire Mid-levels Strake Golf Brewery Top-bar hive Wound healing phases RuneScape quests Erie Canal Lathe Floppy disk Dundas Square Washington Monument Diseases of the honeybee

any ideas on hand carving a crochet hook measurements please if you cannot attend one of nancy nehring's create your own crochet hook classes offered at the crochet guild of america's national regional conferences www crochet org then you might want to check out this website http serendipity gpvm com straight html measurements differ based upon the individual's taste in hooks you would need to determine if you like a rounded head like the susan bates or a pointed head like the boye then determine if it's an inline or an a line the bowl of the hook that resides under the lip how long the neck is where the loops of the stitches reside and if the body will be round or if it will include a thumb finger rest the overall length of the hook matters too because stitches requiring more yarn overs will require a longer neck to ensure the loops are uniform in size same deal with tunisian or crochet on the double type hooks as for the stitch measurement that the hook will create there are a variety of websites books that include charts of the american sizing like size h and the metric sizing this is most important an example would be this website http www hassdesign com basicfilettechniques crochethooksandthread i hope this helps dee stanziano cyca certified crochet teacher owner of many types of crochet hooks  Textile manufacturing Textile manufacturing terminology Knitting Bass guitar World Wide Web Knitting needle Sewing machine HTML element Boy Scouts of America Uniform Resource Locator JavaServer Pages Fast bowling Double bass Anchor Handloading Professional wrestling holds Drill bit HyperText Transfer Protocol Tatting Professional wrestling throws Harp C plus plus New England Patriots CPU cache Cricket Mixed martial arts Archery Mattress Compiler optimization Sin City Dreadlocks Screw Suplex Copyright law of the United Kingdom Website Aerial (dance move) Vowel Gesture Shotgun Supply and demand International Phonetic Alphabet Equine conformation Trombone Boxing Brassiere Japanese tea ceremony Bookbinding Cat Dynamical system Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Software engineering Vector (spatial) Clarinet XHTML Snooker Uniform Resource Identifier Phishing Textile Metric system Mass Saxophone SAML Champagne (beverage) Quizbowl Web crawler Evolution of the Horse Scapula Transmission Control Protocol Ship model Types of bowlers in cricket HTML Einstein-Cartan theory Mathematics of general relativity Conducting Professional wrestling attacks Firefighter Fly fishing JavaScript Passenger car Antenna (radio) Backstroke Velcro Yarn Space elevator Aikido Lute Umpire (cricket) Poker jargon Debate Hangul United States House of Representatives Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma GED Color Common Unix Printing System

how to fix miter saw blade guard and is the blade too loose my miter saw was in storage for the last few months and when i took it out to give it a test run i noticed that when you lower the blade the guard does not lift up the guard can be moved with my hand so its not stuck how can i fix this any ideas also the blade itself seems to be a little loose like swaying from side to side but only a very tiny tiny bit it doesn't seem to bother cutting any wood but i was afraid it might loose too much this i can lookup in my manual the blade guard is what i am trouble with the most the guard issue is difficult to address there are several ways that these can be configured without a model or even a manufacturer it is hard to guess there is some kind of linkage between the guard and the pivot point of the saw part of this is loose again hard to know where to tell you to look more specifically the loose blade is a different story a few possibilities there could be the wrong blade there are different sizes and shapes of arbors and holes in the center of the blade putting the wrong blade on the saw will cause a problem i doubt that this is your problem could simply be that the nut that holds the blade on is a bit loose if this is the case it is hazardous to operate the saw you need to check this before you operate the saw again sometimes the bolt or nut holding the blade will become a bit rusted and feel tight before it is so remove it clean if needed and reinstall this should not come loose from storage if it is loose it probably was loose when you put it in storage last possibility is a bearing problem as the bearings in the saw wear they will allow the spindle to wobble a bit if you can wiggle the spindle a bit with no blade on the saw this is your problem it should take a bit of use to wear the bearings but they can go early if you try to cut material that is too heavy for the saw or try to cut too fast cheaper saws will tend to wear faster than a more expensive saw this will cause your cuts to be a bit less accurate but you can use the saw with a bit of wear once it starts to wobble it will get worse quickly so plan to repair or replace soon  Drill bit Table saw Knife Floppy disk Gramophone record Internal ballistics Hard disk Wind turbine M16 (rifle) Radio controlled airplane Screw Motorcycle Equine conformation Textile manufacturing Violin M60 machine gun Lawn mower Lathe Glossary of climbing terms Heinkel He 112 Carburetor Woodworking Miter saw Mattress Upholstery Oxy-fuel welding and cutting CPU design Tire Helicopter Rifle Electrophysiology Windows XP Poker jargon Central processing unit Table tennis Bicycle brake systems Strap-on dildo Hash table USB flash drive Drill Rail tracks Virtual memory Computer virus IBM PC Space Shuttle program 2000 Australian Grand Prix Floyd Rose Car handling Computer Katana Axe Bullet Mach kernel E85 DVD Manual transmission Chainsaw Figure skating Fast bowling Mouse (computing) Seismic retrofit Extreme Programming Keynesian economics Laserdisc Loudspeaker B-47 Stratojet Clinker (boat building) Phonograph cylinder Fecal incontinence Plane (tool) Digital photography Operation Market Garden Glossary of partner dance terms Bicycle lighting Circular saw Linked list Anchor Second Battle of the Atlantic Lathe (metal) Wood router Modem Parachute Bicycle frame Welding Space elevator Motor oil Menstrual cup IBM PC compatible Redundant array of independent disks Jet engine Tariff

does anybody know how to use timber sleepers for decking g'day i am planning on using timber sleepers to create a walkway around my pool however i am not to sure how to go about it ie how to prepare the surface to lay the timber and the best type of oil to use to prevent the wood from rotting thanks the hardest thing about laying down sleeper is to create a level finished surface it requires a solid and level surface this is done by excavating down to the clay using a tamper to compress the clay and a layer of loose gravel raked and levelled place down some landscape cloth to prevent grass and weeds from growing up through you walkway and lay down the sleepers it might be a good idea to drill holes through the timbers and drive spikes or rebar through the holes into the ground to limit movement then work down the walkway and level the timbers on both sides using shims its a detailed process which will be significantly easier with a laser level or transit but an ordinary straight edge and level will work a little pl on the shims should suffice as a way of securing the shims to the timbers the final stage is the cutting and placement of the decking material for all exterior wood projects pressure treated lumber is the best choice however any wood which comes in contact with the earth needs to be pressure treated most pressure treated lumber has a life span of years when exposed to the weather non treated lumber has a life expectancy of about half as long you can extend the life of your walkway by using a thick tar like sealant on the bottom and sides of the timbers but it makes for a messy job  Seismic retrofit Drill bit Wood Deck (ship) Rail tracks Anchor Glacier Lumber Upholstery Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Professional wrestling holds Masonry Knife Poker jargon Sewage treatment Equine conformation Coal Volleyball Suspension bridge Construction Timber framing San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Solar cell Ice core Naval mine Deforestation Tire Screw Welding Diamond Waste management Opportunity rover Plane (tool) Escalator Logging Ship Campfire Desert Dam Diving suit Erosion Hemp Glass Woodworking Drawing A151 road Geology of the British Isles Babbitt metal Brewery Carbon dioxide Textile manufacturing Geodesic dome Flood geology Rail terminology Spark plug Straw-bale construction Dairy Lock picking Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Dundas Square Radio controlled airplane Swiss plateau Petroleum Drainage Saw Pavement (material) Psoriasis Reinforced concrete Rigging Powder metallurgy Sutherland Shire Billiards Stonehenge Nuclear weapon design Floppy disk Lawn mower Professional wrestling throws Vacuum Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Tooth Pok__mon Abilities Cricket Microphone Land mine Wood fuel Table tennis Clinker (boat building) Black hole Mars Exploration Rover Laserdisc Geology of the Alps

whats the difference or when would i use varnish eurethane or shellac all three of these products serve a similar purpose the properties of the finish are a bit different so you select the finish based upon what you want it to do for you varnish is a very old type of finish it can be difficult to work with and can get gummy after several years if not maintained it is a good choice for use on a furniture piece that needs a rich antique look finish but for general purpose i would avoid it shellac is another very old finish the main reason it is not often used is the orange red cast of the finish it is actually the easiest finish to work with very forgiving the finish is fairly hard and will take a reasonable amount of abuse it will stick to darn near anything and will seal in most bleeding stains and odors it was the earliest form of stain block and is still the base component of the best ones in my opinion shellac can be used on nearly anything interior floors trim windows furniture cabinets etc i suspect you mean polyurethane as your other option true urethane is hard to find outside of some specialty applications two varieties of polyurethane both are a general purpose sealer for wood either over stain or bare wood the old style poly is oil based and is still a viable option requires mineral spirits for thinning and cleanup and gives the finished product a bit of a yellow cast the product will sometimes turn more yellow over time water borne polyurethane is the new version another very good general purpose finish water to thin soap and water to clean up it dries clear and most will remain clear over a long period of time either polyurethane can be used on nearly any wood product inside but check the label if doing floors as some are a bit too soft and will state they are not suitable for floors can be used outside as well if the product is labeled for exterior use so my choice for most products in order of preference waterborne polyurethane shellac where appropriate sometimes it is actually first choice oil polyurethane varnish very rarely  Paint Polyurethane Plastic Wood Mattress Lacquer Drill bit Violin Woodworking Gramophone record Pottery Hamster Upholstery Casting Dodge Charger Shellac Poker jargon Menstrual cup Knife Sento Carburetor CPU cache Screw Wood finishing Epoxy Condom Visual Basic Japanese toilet Thermal power station Radio controlled airplane Diamond simulant Bong Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Kitchen Steel Diamond Transformer Bulk vending Wood carving Anchor Japanese tea ceremony Opportunity rover Expert system Aluminium Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Amber Fancy rat Welding Jute Bicycle lighting Single Transferable Vote Glass Peanut Skateboard MP3 Pump It Up Cookware and bakeware Light-emitting diode Carpet Mouse (computing) Chromium Hydrochloric acid Gas metal arc welding Campfire Central processing unit Bass guitar Chevrolet Corvair Liquid crystal Lighting Leather Table saw The Amazing Race Psoriasis Handloading Dialysis Cell (biology) Perfume Fire fighting Oscilloscope Laser engraving Solar power XML Bladderwort Bubble Bobble Mushroom hunting Diving suit Tlingit Equine conformation

ingredients for making cementitious acrylic stucco stucco products like total wall drivit etc should be fairly easy to make rather than buying the combined powdered mix no i'm afraid they are not easy to make you can make a material that will stick using mortar fine sand and an acrylic additive such as acryl but the plasticity will not be the same nor will the final texture the companies that produce the products you mentioned use proprietary chemicals for binders and plasticizers that are not easily duplicated you would have to do a bit of trial and error and may not realize that you have a problem until a few years down the road  Stucco Plastic Paint Polymethyl methacrylate Portland cement Concrete Casting Pottery Ceramics Genericized trademark Mortar (masonry) Straw-bale construction Silicon Knitting Hamster Asbestos Fiberglass Polystyrene Epoxy Bong Lacquer Plaster Building material Tofu Pastel Masonry Explosive material Welding Architecture of the California missions Powder metallurgy Acrylic paint Drill bit Bulk vending Fire extinguisher Fire fighting Natural building Ice cream Titanium Shell (projectile) Typewriter Seismic retrofit Chocolate Imperial Chemical Industries Asphalt concrete Illegal drug trade Copy protection Leather Dow Chemical Company Inkjet printer Slide rule Soap Drawing Brush Ammonia Tablet Wood Bread Black powder Dinghy Steel Magnetism Lighting Floppy disk Coffee Brewery Traditional animation Aggregate (composite) Maya civilization Tank Flour Sewage treatment Beretta 92F/FS Violin Fountain pen XML Pavement (material) Gesso Diamond simulant Glass Yarn Polyvinyl chloride Toilet paper Rococo Sintering Turquoise Pencil Marble Bengali cuisine Tamiya Corporation Waste management Cement Textile manufacturing terminology Cataract Hydrogen peroxide Cosmetics Knife M16 (rifle) Gramophone record Testor Corporation Alcohol fuel

dry wall lining is it right that you just level up the bevel edges with plaster or skim the whole board i'm assuming you live in the uk if you do then first the edge of a dry lining board has a recess which you then butt to the next board it is important that every butt edge between boards has this recess you then either nail or screw's the boards to the wall making sure the nail heads or screws are finished below the surface you then use a brown tape which you cover the butted joints with then you apply the white mixture over the scrim med joints leaving slightly proud in the usa this stuff is called mud when it has gone off you lightly rub down the joints till smooth it rubs easily and then you fill and cover nail or screw heads then rub this down that's about it you do not have to skim the walls  Front wheel drive Piney Point Village, Texas Infinite Improbability Drive Driver's license Mulholland Drive Drunk driving (United States) Table tennis Mothers Against Drunk Driving Olivier Panis Marine Drive Michael Schumacher Redundant array of independent disks Driveshaft Prost (racing team) David Coulthard Roush Racing Jacques Villeneuve File system Super Bowl XXI Eddie Cheever Jos Verstappen Andrea de Cesaris Penske Racing Nick Heidfeld Fernando Alonso Screw Hendrick Motorsports Super Bowl XXXVIII Wardriving Juan Pablo Montoya Jean-Pierre Jarier Roberto Moreno Commodore PET Super Bowl XXV Rallying Jacky Ickx Magneto-optical drive Volt Richard Childress Racing Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XXIV PlayStation 2 Matt Kenseth Jeff Green (NASCAR) Martin Brundle Jordan Grand Prix Heinz-Harald Frentzen Modchip Laptop Super Bowl XXXIII Super Bowl XXVI Joe Gibbs Racing Frame of reference Marc Gen__ The Purpose Driven Life Electric vehicle Point Roberts, Washington Super Bowl IX Tide American football Jeff Burton Siphon Spy Hunter Chip Ganassi Racing ThinkPad Niki Lauda Kevin Harvick Mark Webber Team McLaren Carlos Reutemann Jimmie Johnson Space shuttle main engine Ernie Irvan Nash equilibrium Terry Labonte March Engineering Kimi R__ikk__nen Super Bowl III Sengkang Super Bowl XX Chickahominy River Takuma Sato Super Bowl XVIII Faster-than-light Giancarlo Fisichella Sterling Marlin British American Racing Super Bowl XXII AmigaOS New York Giants Attractor Florida State Road 15 Evernham Motorsports Toranosuke Takagi Formula One regulations Jenson Button Golf Volleyball Ayrton Senna Jamie McMurray

professional stud finder in heat i am putting plugs into a room and i'm using a professional stud finder i've gone through two of these already costly every time i use it which i've read on the back exactly how to do it and i do exactly what it says it seems like the thing is in heat or something because its always finding a stud i thought maybe i forgot a detail not that hard to use according to directions so i reread it a few times but its always beeping at different points on the wall never consistent and the light comes on each time at a different point both machines do it what is going on here anything else i can use instead to find the stud thanks for your time responses and viewing you need to move the instrument across the wall at a slower speed moving it too fast make the density meter to reread it self off of the drywall moving it slowly across the area a few times should remedy the problem if it persists then there could be more obstacles inside of the wall like water pipes that are causing the false reading i have found that the best stud finder for me is a cow magnet a magnet that they feed to cows to stop any metals such as wire from entering into the intestines they are about long and in diameter and you can find them at any farm supply store to use it as a stud finder simply glue or tape a piece of string to one end and swing it pendulum style across the wall in question the magnet will stick to the nails or screws used to fasten the drywall to the studs so you will need to raise and lower it accordingly hope this helps  Clinker (boat building) Screw Woodworking Drywall Strake Casting Upholstery Violin Seismic retrofit Textile manufacturing Mattress Boat building Gilding Bong Plaster Knife Timpani Plane (tool) Tire Motor oil Adobe Bacon Architecture of the California missions Stucco Welding Paint Temporal bone Manicure Volleyball Straw-bale construction Scapula Glossary of partner dance terms Shawn Michaels Nail (engineering) Dairy Carburetor Glossary of climbing terms Tofu Wrench Chopped & screwed Radio controlled airplane Sea ice Professional wrestling throws Aerial (dance move) Friction Lighting Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Adhesive Drawing Sand casting Strap-on dildo Electrical wiring Snooker Skateboarding trick Professional wrestling match types Tile Tin can Masonry Ammunition Ham Floyd Rose Oceanic trench Siphon Equine conformation Glaze Geology of the Grand Canyon area Repouss__ and chasing Ulna Mixed martial arts Bassoon Thermal power station Surrealist techniques Rail tracks Climbing equipment Printed circuit board Glacier Skateboard Point groups in three dimensions Bone fracture Painter and decorator Tobacco Nine Inch Nails Callus Montreal Screwjob Drowning A151 road Butterfly stroke Fast bowling Professional wrestling attacks Etching Guqin Soldering Spark plug Wire Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold Billiards Humerus

what's the best way to clean out organize a refrigerator check expiration dates if necessary write the expiration date with a sharpie marker so it is easier to see when buying things like milk rotate the supply oldest towards the front as often as possible store leftovers and foods in see thru containers i keep all fruits together all fresh vegetables together etc use the short plastic baskets to store things like sliced cheese and other smaller items you can use the basket like a drawer to keep the times together yet use as little space as possible for leftover spaghetti sauce soups and other items that come in a can i like to use the glass canning jars you can pour the food into the jar and see what is in it you cna also see at a glance if the food is starting to go bad they also take up less space than the flat square containers when wiping out a refrigerator use a baking soda water solution to deodorize the refrigerator wipe up food spills right away they are much easier to clean when they haven't dried yet keep like items together all diary all vegetables all leftovers etc on you leftovers be sure to label the date you made that food item  Tung Chung Cherokee Park Cranford, New Jersey British Columbia Hiking Grand Forks, North Dakota King City, Ontario Jennings Randolph Lake Lawn mower Potchefstroom Skiatook, Oklahoma Trail University of Idaho Sport in Ireland Brazil at the 2004 Summer Olympics Sport Hamster Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Guadalupe Mountains National Park Lowell, Massachusetts Perth, Western Australia Lawn United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics Washington State University Prospect Park (Brooklyn) Bicycle National parks of England and Wales Central Park Oelwein, Iowa Kolkata Columbia, Maryland Ocean Beach, New York Tennis Romney, West Virginia Long Beach, California China at the 2004 Summer Olympics Coney Island Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Walking North Kansas City, Missouri Gladstone, Queensland Associated Press Athlete of the Year Germany at the 2004 Summer Olympics Bocas del Toro Province Camping Federal Way, Washington Playground Texas A&M University Indiana State University Commonwealth Games University of Houston London 2012 Olympic bid Zagreb Hersheypark Dog Spokane, Washington Burning Man Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Argentina at the 2004 Summer Olympics Brentwood, Los Angeles, California New Zealand at the 2004 Summer Olympics Southeastern Conference Quito Syracuse University Orange King George V School Culture of Singapore St Kevin's College Dublin City University Care Bears Richmond, Virginia Mountain biking The Adventures of Pete & Pete National Basketball Association Humphrey Bogart Sailing University of Kentucky Australian Cattle Dog Woodlands, Singapore Rochester, New York The McGuire Sisters The George Washington University Woodridge, Illinois Atlantic Coast Conference Los Angeles, California Randolph-Macon College Eugene, Oregon Cycling Muir Woods National Monument West Virginia University Toronto Raptors Sports in Puerto Rico University of California, Santa Cruz Wimbledon, London Bend, Oregon Louisville, Kentucky Cape Town Tulsa, Oklahoma Woking Hunter College High School

can the ridge beam for a shed be cut in half i'm building a x shed the ridge beam is to be feet long and it will be thick do i have to use an foot long board or can i use boards and if i can use board do i need to attach them to each other for good advise read this roof rafters connect the ridge beam to the top of the walls if the ridge beam is allowed to deflect then the walls will push out and away from each other this is not good to avoid this you can use a continuous ridge beam but it must be sized and supported to carry a deigned load and eliminate all downward deflection it is far easier to keep the walls from spreading apart by installing ceiling joist that span from wall to wall if the walls can't spread apart then you can use a non structural ridge beam and install it in two pieces the ridge beam butt joint should fall in the center of a roof rafter it's that simple  Paint Pottery Varnish Wood finishing Woodworking Wood carving Arcade cabinet Stucco Violin Casting Tooth enamel Billiards Leather Brush Dinghy Plastic Eolian Pencil Glass Hash table Traditional animation Gambling Amber Pine Pittsburgh Steelers Upholstery USS Sand Lance (SS-381) Diamond simulant Clinker (boat building) Subroutine Stained glass Epoxy Lacquer Campfire New York Jets Hereford Cathedral Grand Central Terminal Technicolor Caedmon's Call Film preservation Chinchilla Pennsylvania Railroad Yellow Desert Soap Oakland Athletics Drawing EIA-708 Toilet paper Color New Orleans Saints Slide rule Marina District Eczema Wood Volleyball Resident Evil (video game) Sand casting Prime Minister of Australia Mattress CPU cache The Last Supper (Leonardo) Shoe polish Blood (computer game) USS Tunny (SS-282) Polyurethane School bus yellow Rosin Printmaking Carpet Carbonated water Super Mario 64 Christmas tree Polymer clay Poker jargon Sandpaper System/34 St. Raphael's Cathedral (Dubuque) Henna Super Chief Araucaria heterophylla Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Game Boy Micro Wall Street Metroid Prime Texas Rangers (baseball) System/36 Cupid and Psyche Sand Dishwashing Abbie G.

how long can i run copper wire for amp service and still meet code i need to power an amp boat lift but would like to keep the circuit rating at amp thanks you didn't specify the service voltage but for vac single phase copper wire amps the voltage drop is a tad over volts per ft the voltage drop is linear so you can extrapolate this means there will only be about vac available to the load at ft for vac the length is about ft since you wish to maintain amp service you'll need to consider that as the load rather than the intended use load some appliances will operate at vac so you can have about ft of wire before the voltage drops to vac the voltage drop will be different for different types of service i e different voltages and or multi phase service see the site below for more info there is a calculator at the bottom of the page http www powerstream com wire size htm  Bong Glass Plastic Door Printed circuit board Manifold The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap Solar cell Wine making Aztalan State Park, Wisconsin Christmas tree Diamond enhancement Drill bit Wheat beer Klein bottle Bottle opener Brewery Bottle Marching band PHP Wine Champagne (beverage) Woodworking Lake Wine bottle Coffee Polyethylene terephthalate Dundas Square Ketchup Cloud Beer Float glass USS Yorktown (CV-5) Great Lakes M__bius strip Milk Seismic retrofit Descriptive geometry Peruvian cuisine Glacier Water Shotgunning Smoking pipe The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Food preservation Sento Guinness Mario Fountain pen Bassoon Bubble Bobble Beverage can Poker jargon Air conditioning Professional wrestling throws Derrick (lifting device) New Orleans Mardi Gras Recycling Simply connected space Wood carving Hand grenade Harp Recycling of PET Bottles Lava lamp Apollo 15 Piccolo (Dragon Ball) I Ching divination Billiards Paul Newman The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Cello Diamond Martini cocktail Sunlight Wampum Inca Kola Homebrewing Geodesic dome Drilling and threading Super Mario 64 Port wine Sushi Motor oil Seine (fishing) Beverly Hills, California The Time Machine Screw Link (Legend of Zelda) Belgian beer Ice core Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Snipe hunt Stairway Banjo-Tooie Refrigerator car Traditional animation Sundial The Glass Bead Game Soldering

creative way to hang pics i want to hang up pics of friends and family in my room but none of them are framed and i dont want to frame them any creative ideas as to what i can put them on to fasten to my walls why not make a collage with them overlapping some of the pics so as to not have them looked all squared and rigid but giving a certain sense of disorder and maybe put a cardboard base behind them so as to protect them from getting bent or damaged of course the cardboard should not be visible it's just to reinforce the back side of your collage then hang it on the wall with a nail it shouldn't be heavy so a nail on top should be enough or maybe even another one in the lolwer part to make sure it stays fixed  Wrench Bong Siphon Screw Domestic water system Plumbing fixture RuneScape Mini-Games Diamond Flush toilet Glossary of firefighting equipment Basement Soldering Professional wrestling throws RBMK Ocean thermal energy conversion Samovar Carbon dioxide Water purification Seismic retrofit Professional wrestling holds Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Urinal Kitchen Sewer Irrigation Drainage Toilet Columbine High School massacre RuneScape weapons Toilet paper Forge Motor oil Saw (film) Pearl Cubic zirconia Pipeline (Unix) Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Toilet humour Naval mine Japanese toilet Geodesic dome Glass Aerial (dance move) Tap (valve) Borehole Dundas Square Blood Simple Castle of the Winds Hamster Anchor Sewage treatment Smoking pipe Coriolis effect Derbyshire lead mining history Nut (fruit) Bathroom Dialysis Guitar Radiator Scar Saw II Cookie Hydropower Rebreather Ground (electricity) Fishing Suplex Glossary of climbing terms Sailing Fire hydrant Climbing equipment Bladderwort Dairy World Trade Center Universal Serial Bus Great Lakes Cashew Metalworking Hydraulic machinery Titanic (1997 film) The Shining (film) Thermal power station The Demon Sorcerers Containment building Autonomous building Vacuum cleaner Carnivorous plant River The Phantom Manor RuneScape skills Furnace Snake Menstrual cup Ship Toilet-related injury Hogwarts Floor Directory Affair of the diamond necklace Ammunition Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II

is there a way to refinish wood baseboards and trim all of my baseboards and trim are years old and beat up looking from the previous home owners i'm putting in new flooring and don't really want to put this trim back down is there a way to strip down and refinish what i have rather than having to just replace it all new if they are wood remove them before laying the new flooring get a grit sand paper and see if you can smooth out the dings as well as remove the old finish then if you are going to repaint them apply a coat of primer and then paint if you are going to use wood stain on them omit the primer step good luck  Oak Drawing Ballpoint pen Daredevil Slavic mythology Restaurant Dining room Rock (music) Chair Billiards Kitchen Temecula, California Manicure Guinea pig Wand Upholstery Woodworking Totally Spies!

what do i do if i have a drill bit stuck is the drill bit stuck in the drill or is it stuck in the material you were drilling if it's stuck in the drill you'll just need a strong grip and some muscle to loosen it if it's stuck in the material make sure the bit is secured very tightly in the drill so the drill won't just spin around it set the drill on reverse and do your best to back it out if that doesn't work take the drill off leaving the material and the bit and use some pliers or vise grips to try and wiggle the bit out if it won't damage the material you can try spraying some wd on the bit to lubricate it and make it easier to remove alternatively you could put some graphite powder on it to encourage it to move more easily  Plastic Water (molecule) Solvent Hydrochloric acid Aluminium Cyanoacrylate Fiberglass Tooth Opportunity rover Soap Steel Explosive material Carbon Seismic retrofit Welding Stucco Protein Ozone depletion Alkane Tooth enamel Corrosion Titanium Gelatin Ammonia Resin Ozone hole Iron Flood geology Acetic acid Sulfur Coffee Biochemistry Ice core Polymer Vitamin C Benzene Knife Brewery Casting Silicon Brazing Portland cement Tissue engineering Epoxy Haloalkane Glacier Terminal ballistics Water Ultraviolet Paint Leather Hydrogen peroxide Teflon Phase (matter) Illegal drug trade Magnesium Alum Wood Glass Carbon nanotube Industrial process Human skin color Crocodilia Sulfuric acid Liquid crystal Concrete Hydrogen chloride Hand grenade Geology of the Moon Alcohol Vulcanization Roof Tuff Sperm Whale Hippopotamus Great Lakes Ceramics Antarctic krill SpongeBob SquarePants Mineral Diving Ethyl acetate Mattress Uranium Coal Cheese Aspartame Zinc Industrial wastewater treatment Dead Sea Sodium Chromatography

how hard is it to change the floor flange under the toilet my upstairs toilet was leaking i pulled up the toilet cut away the rotten wood and still have to replace the floor flange it looks like the drain itself is pvc but i'm not sure my house is in the north east and it was built in ' i think the toilet and the wax ring are original which brings up another question how often are you supposed to change the wax ring if at all i have two other toilets i think one other is also leaking the flange i have is rotten to the point that i don't know what it's made of if the drain is pvc you just cut the flange off and glue one on with pvc pipe glue the problem you may run into is once cut the pipe may not be long enough if that is the case you will have to cut the pipe short enough to add a coupler and a short piece of pipe and the flange if you have a degree elbow just under the toilet cut the pipe back past the elbow add a coupler and a short piece of pipe then an elbow and then a piece of pipe for the flange same thing with abs black plastic wax gaskets are usually good for decades if installed properly but anytime you think it's leaking it should be replaced  Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Autonomous building Sewer Basement Irrigation Swimming pool Drainage Solar power Welding Sewage treatment Derbyshire lead mining history New Orleans, Louisiana Urban sprawl Microeconomics Roman road Construction Mortgage 2005 Maharashtra floods Zuiderzee Works History of the Panama Canal Civil engineering Geodesic dome SimCity 4 Narrow gauge Mars, Pennsylvania Elis Prefecture Grand Forks, North Dakota Eifel Aqueduct Wal-Mart Airport Water supply Erie Canal Cable television Milwaukee, Wisconsin Extreme Programming Road Public good Panama Canal Manitoba Hydro Thermal power station CPU design Tag History of Chicago Air-raid shelter Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory Motor oil M16 (rifle) Dairy Air traffic controller Humphrey Bogart Red River Flood, 1997 West Side Highway Keynesian economics Dundas Square Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans New York City Subway nomenclature Easement Energy development Mount Pinatubo Electrical wiring Education in the People's Republic of China Locomotive Personal rapid transit Hebburn Atlanta metropolitan area King City, Ontario Water purification Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans Gyeongju Columbus, Ohio Gas metal arc welding Sacramento, California 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Stream Watershed Crime prevention through environmental design A151 road Geography of India Salt Lake City, Utah Hydroponics Boston and Lowell Railroad Mach kernel National Weather Service Political subdivisions of New York State Solar cell Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Education in the United States Fire hydrant Sinkhole Parking lot Dam Hollywood, Los Angeles, California Bethalto, Illinois Fraser Valley Regional District, British Columbia Celebration, Florida Virtual memory

how should i clean my newly uncovered wood floors i recently purchased my first home i had the only carpet ever laid over the art deco style wood floors in the living and dining room pulled up the exposed wood floors have some stains which are kind of grayish black and some paint stains other than that i don't think they are in bad enough shape just grime and dirt to need total refinshing what could i use to clean them i've thought of using a buffer machine renting and using a scrubber pad one of the green or red ones and some simple green or murphy's wood soap is this going to give me an ok result you're best off using the most gentle method possible the paint may be hard to remove if the floor has a varnish or polyurethane finish maybe some googone or mineral spirits will soften it up enough to scrape it with a plastic putty knife go with the grain the dark spots may not come out but you could try some extra fine steel wool if the floor is waxed or if there is any raw wood showing do not use anything containing water this includes murphy's oil soap simple green and bleach there are very few instances where any of these should be used on a wood floor if you must use something with water use a hardwood floor cleaner that contains alcohol it evaporates quickly and doesn't leave residue like murphy's or simple green also never use any ammoniated products clean off the paint steel wool the dark areas and reseal then either clean by hand with hardwood floor cleaner or if it has a wax finish apply a very thin coat of paste wax and buff also any type of hardwood floor product that says it polishes is best to be avoided it may be good short term but not long term  Upholstery Paint Diving suit Staining (biology) Gram staining Social rule Mattress Campfire Charles Goodyear Leaf Shoe polish Lacquer Dry cleaning Condom Wood Humidity The Shining (film) Personal lubricant Carbon dioxide Laundry Woodworking Rice Hamster Plastic Soldering Menstrual cup Vacuum cleaner Hemp Social aspects of clothing Flax Bedbug 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Strap-on dildo Toilet Cello Bacteria Great Teacher Onizuka Camp Lazlo Soap opera Eczema Primer (paint) McMansion Carnivorous plant Dye Stained glass Dairy Soap The Human Stain Brush Printmaking Laws of cricket Baptism New Zealand flax Knife Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Home repair Pitaten The Adventures of Pete & Pete Vulcanization Sauna AFI 100 Years series Wood carving FoxTrot Casting Fiddler on the Roof Chair Fire extinguisher Israeli settlement Tattoo The Ashlee Simpson Show The Star Wars Holiday Special Air conditioning Cannabis cultivation Sento Haibane Renmei Carpet Jatob__ Sinfest Taxi Driver Compton Wynyates Wound Washing machine Leather Assonet, Massachusetts Friends Wood finishing Mud People Psoriasis Papyrus Sushi Jumpstart 3rd Grade Glass Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Adhesive Martin Luther King, Jr. Holes (book) Cricket pitch

if you grind up hardened cement can it be re used i've got a fair amount of dust that was produced while cutting some aerated cement breeze blocks and i was wondering if i can treat it like fresh cement and use it to make mortar otherwise i'll have to go out and buy another bag even though i only need a bit more the cement dust is no longer usable due to the chemical reaction that occurs when it is mixed with water the the properties of the cement are still there they are in a different form please wear a mask when cutting concrete of any kind silica is a product of cement and is a fine dust particle with barbs when you inhale it the silica attaches itself to your lungs and does not leave when you exhale  Drill bit Screw Drill Floppy disk Tire Internal ballistics Campfire Metalworking Shell (projectile) Cartridge (firearms) Springfield 1903 rifle Light-frame construction Electrical wiring Air-raid shelter Shotgun Glossary of climbing terms Drill bit sizes Seismic retrofit Snooker M16 (rifle) Knife Lighting Oil well Fabrication (metal) Bicycle frame Window Poker jargon Disc brake GunZ The Duel Hydraulic machinery Iowa class battleship Stairway Violin Wood router Marching band Drilling and threading Tool bit Battle of the Bulge Printed circuit board Do it yourself Pile Drag racing Jam (TV series) Tubular pin tumbler lock Sexual orientation Barbed wire Basketball Ford Crown Victoria Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Textile manufacturing Aerial (dance move) Social rule Woodworking BMW M5 Sonic the Hedgehog 2 BS 1363 Rifle Passenger car Undergarment Timpani Dog agility Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Safe-cracking I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue M60 machine gun Parade (military) Volleyball Vise (tool) Snake Clinker (boat building) Billiards George W.

recently laid tile lost it's lustre i removed as much as the grout haze as i could by simply wiping down it doesn't look like there is any haze left but my tiles don't seem as dark and shiny as they did before grouting i don't think it's leftover grout haze but even if it was there are squares of marble in the design so i don't think i can use the commercial haze out is there any way to get the shine and color back in my tiles should i buff the floor with sheepskin flannel or something like that i scrubbed and wiped the floors more than times the bucket of water was barely cloudy the last time i wiped my arms and knees hurt perhaps i overdid it and etched the tiles the white cloth comes up still clean i guess i should try the gloss sealer if it is grout haze and it is already dry it is best not to try to get it off as it will scratch the floors you could try to treat the tiles with a mop n glow type product but your best bet is to use a product like aqua mix high gloss sealer and finisher it is available at lowes it will cost you about but it should bring a high gloss finish back to your tiles and will seal the grout as well good luck  Textile manufacturing Textile Hair coloring Upholstery Clorox Textile manufacturing terminology Cloth Knitting Plastic Mattress Jute Bleach Wood pulp Kimono Laundry detergent Menstrual cup Weaving Skinhead Washing machine Menstrual cycle Linen Dry cleaning Dye Alpaca Brewery Cochineal Tallit Flax Cashmere wool Social aspects of clothing Photographic developer Niddah Shroud of Turin Heavy metal fashion Hydrogen peroxide Light-emitting diode T-shirt Casting Pigment Carbon fiber Staining (biology) Snooker Tooth enamel Fiberglass Chlorine Sodium percarbonate Sodium hypochlorite Indigo dye Sari Hemp Dishwashing Felt Water purification Clothing Death rock fashion Tire Diaper Billiards Bong Cotton Camouflage Fabrication (metal) Denim Undergarment Sugarcane Hakama Ozone Coir Tofu Drill bit Flag of India Organic peroxide Color theory Indian English White bread Corduroy Flour Egg (food) Reckitt Benckiser CPU design Food coloring Gramophone record Glass Clothing terminology C-41 process Procter & Gamble Leather Pottery Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Yarn Paper Strap-on dildo Gram staining Sewing machine Reinforced concrete Joker (comics) Christmas tree Metalworking

how easy is it to install a bathfan replacing two old bath fans with two new ones very small bathfan for a medium bath i know a little about electrical but not what wires are what do you just take off the old fan and put the wires into the new one will there be a designated place to put the wires and how many wires are there to dis connect thanks not all fans need to be installed from the attic i installed many without needing to go to attic only reason to go to attic would to maybe add additional supports assuming the new fan is same size as the old one there is wires that would be disconnected unless there is no ground which then would be hot black wire and the neutral white wire turn off the power remove the cover remove the fan housing look at the sides of fan there could be some screws remove these screws if you dont' see the screws you can either use a recipicater to remove them or go into attic and remove them manually for some reason they may be up there remove ducting and electrical conections attach ducting and elecrical connections white with white black with black there will be either a green screw or thin copper wire attach this to the bare copper wire if you have one depending on age of your house you may or may not have ground this is a whole nother question use wirenuts for its size and secure it by wrapping electrical tape clockwise around the wirenut and wire this will keep the cap from working its way loose also you may want to istall a grommet plastic that surrounds the metal hole so wires dont get frayed when installing the wire through the hole some fans have this built in some dont' install the new fan in hole flush it with the drywall secure it with screws follow rest of directions that should be supplied with fan  Electrical wiring Electrophysiology Wire Wire wrap Brush Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Overhead lines Antenna (radio) Nail (engineering) Skateboarding trick Naval mine Staple (fastener) Drill bit Transformer Earthing system Coaxial cable Suspension bridge Category 5 cable Overhead powerline Cruising (maritime) Nine Inch Nails Screw Directed-energy weapon Team Fortress Classic Action potential Seismic retrofit BS 1363 CLAMP Guy-wire Ribbon cable Fuse (electrical) D-subminiature Electric power transmission Wall Machine gun Floyd Rose Professional wrestling match types Dipole antenna Financial services USS Turner Joy (DD-951) B-47 Stratojet Firearm Time Out of Mind Economy of Russia Rail terminology Solar power Gambling M60 machine gun Glossary of climbing terms Bolted joint Magnet American wire gauge TIA-568A/B Retaining wall Mad Money Anti-tank Bookbinding Barbed wire Cable television Diving suit Public transport Donald Neilson Radio masts and towers Railgun Energy development Ethernet Anchor Wardenclyffe Tower Memoir '44 Ra (board game) Power cable Agricultural fencing Microeconomics Transmission line Bond Asbestos Die (manufacturing) Telephone tapping Wireless access point Insulator Home Box Office MTV Tesco Archery Conductor (material) McMansion The Apprentice 3 Doom enemies History of radar Rigging Circuit design USA PATRIOT Act OV-10 Bronco Upholstery Bank SCO-Linux controversies Bread Yu-Gi-Oh!

electrician advice needed asap i got a new outdoor floodlight socket to replace the old socket and the old component had wires from the ceiling white and black going into each socket the new socket came with just one black and one white to tie into the existing wires of the house i clipped all four of the old wires and just connected the white w white and black w black giving me three of each tied up i turned the power back on and nothing any suggestions thanks first i would get the voltage ohm meter as suggested above second if you have too many wires then stop what you are doing and try to find out the answer before turning on power you could have and may have shorted out the light it probably would have been better to have two whites together with a connector and out of the way and two blacks together with a connector and out of the way and just use one black and one white wire just don't mix the black and white wires also make sure that your light works and that you turn on the light after you turn on the power  Carpenter Miyamoto Musashi Timber framing Light-frame construction Escape from New York Volkswagen Type 2 Window Wayne Corporation Passenger car Robert Lawson (architect) Almanzo Wilder Gothic architecture Apple Macintosh Yohoho!

how do you get ink out of a leather couch this really depends on what type of leather it is if it is on a pigmented leather then the first thing you should try is an ink stick the fresher the ink the more chance you have of removing it it is a good idea to have one in your house if you have a pale leather and children you should also be using a good quality leather protector on your suite this will act like a 'scotchgard' and will make any more mishaps easier to clean off if an ink stick doesn't work a solvent based remover will need to be used and it may also remove finish and pigment so is best left to the experts using hairspray is very risky ait but can make the matter far worse as it can spread the ink over a bigger area especially on an aniline style leather and can sometimes then be impossible to fix nail varnish remover or any other solvents will remove the finish and pigment which will need replacing do not use baby wipes as they are about the worst thing you can use on a leather as they break down the finish and will eventually ruin it please do not try milk it is a silly idea that this will work and will leave sticky residues on the surface which will help to break down the finish if the ink is on an aniline style there is nothing that will remove it because the ink will have re dyed the leather it may dissipate over time with cleaning and protecting old ink will be harder to remove than new ink and may mean resorting to solvents which will also remove the finish this is probably best left to the experts silicones furniture polish are the worst thing to use on leather as they will form a coating on the surface of the leather which will not allow any moisture to get to the leather and will eventually break all the finish down and make it crack leather needs water and should not be protected against it leather does not need conditioning it needs cleaning and protecting on a regular basis with water based products this will keep it rehydrated and supple oils will make things much worse leather should be cleaned gently not scrubbed so 'elbow grease' will only do damage to the finish nail varnish remover solvents will remove the finish on the leather even if you cannot tell it is doing so and alcohol may do the same depending on the strength of the finish on the leather source s www lttsolutions net leather care consultnts to the furniture and cleaning industries  Clothing Kilt T-shirt Canadian Armed Forces Shirt Kimono Tallit Plaid Fight Club Doublet (clothing) Textile manufacturing terminology United States Marine Corps B-47 Stratojet Casualty lifting Mattress Venturing (BSA) Comanche Heavy metal fashion Epaulette Golf Blankets (graphic novel) Animal Crossing Gramophone record Milton H.

how do i choose and install a radon fan i want to put a fan on our passive radon system already put under house and vented through roof i'd like to hook up the fan in our basement myself but could use some help finding a good resource to choose the fan from is there somewhere online i can go to research buy or would a lowes hd be my best bet thanks p a fan for a passive system needs to be sized for the square footage of your basement and for the method used beneath the floor of your basement to allow the air to flow to the pipe if you don't know how this was done it is good to question the builder typically either drain tile is used or gravel is laid to allow air movement under the floor to the vent pipe in some cases as has been my experience neither of these are done and the pipe is shoved into the dirt and the vent doesn't work at all as far as installing the fan in the basement this not advisable a radon fan must be installed outside the living space of the home in your case in the attic the reason for this is because if a leak were ever to developed above the fan it would force high concentrations of radon into your house this is clearly stated in all radon mitigation protocols a radon fan is a specialized piece of equipment that's designed to run in wet conditions and at lower amperages also a manometer should be added assure that the fan is working and moving the air from the ground that is required to reduce your radon level don't try to buy something at the local big box store if you would like to contact me i could help you out  Tap (valve) Glossary of firefighting equipment Irrigation Thermal power station Bathing Severe weather terminology (United States) Toilet paper Furnace Japanese toilet Dishwasher Hard water Bathroom Fire Sprinkler Siphon Thermostat Samovar Swimming pool Sauna Hot air balloon Plumbing fixture Glossary of firefighting terms Menstrual cup Temperature Urinal Hyperthermia Hydrotherapy Customs and etiquette of Japan Powder metallurgy Vinegar Hand grenade Autonomous building Energy development Vacuum tube Textile manufacturing Mattress Japanese tea ceremony White phosphorus incendiary HVAC Climate of the United Kingdom Pottery Bidet Fossil fuel power plant Equine conformation Refrigerator Air pollution Barbecue Washroom Solar power Social rule Astronomy on Mars Otitis externa Hot tub Sun Geyser Comet Cruising (maritime) Fountain Poker jargon Apollo Command/Service Module Diving Wallpaper Turbojet P-38 Lightning Swimming Hot spring Aluminium Internal ballistics Toilet humour Meteor shower Avalanche Floppy disk Heckler & Koch G3 Gas metal arc welding Knife Instant coffee Onsen Tofu Acetic acid Firefighter Bookbinding Opportunity rover Agar plate Alkane Degree Fahrenheit Chevrolet Corvair Fecal incontinence Sin City Renewable energy Curling Espresso Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Domestic water system Dialysis Steam engine M-209 Polyethylene terephthalate

do you have to have a cold water tank in the loft if you have a combi boiler is it better to have everything on the mains how do you stop the water pressure dropping when more that one outlet is being used at the same time would appreciate feed back thanks combi boilers do not need a tank in the loft space a properly fitted combi system should have all the cold taps direct from the mains water supply so there is no need for a storage tank a drop in hot water pressure when using more than one outlet is a disadvantage of any water heating system where the water is heated on demand particularly if the boiler is working at or near its maximum  Basement Radon Solar power Autonomous building HVAC Seismic retrofit Thermal power station Kitchen Loudspeaker Rebreather Electrical wiring Carburetor Solar cell Furnace Bungalow Airbag Passive solar Nuclear power Stairway Renewable energy Electrophysiology Poker jargon Wind power Hard disk Anchor Air conditioning Diving Jet engine Thermostat Helium Hydroponics Sewage treatment Flush toilet Irrigation Air-raid shelter Residual-current device Domestic water system Dymaxion house Home repair Hydrogen peroxide Mattress Mass Nuclear reactor CPU cache Soldering Oceanic trench Ionizing radiation Fluorine Air pollution Swamp cooler Motorcycle Craps Scramjet Passenger car Betting (poker) Surveillance Urinary incontinence Kitesurfing Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Welding Cable television Lunar Prospector Fire Sprinkler Plumbing fixture Animal Crossing Dog agility Volleyball Glossary of firefighting terms Blood pressure Casting Abiogenic petroleum origin Parachute Decompression sickness Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Password E85 Axial compressor Universal Serial Bus Mach kernel M16 (rifle) Diving regulator Ra (board game) The Brady Bunch Pile Rail terminology Bong Dairy Air traffic controller RuneScape Mini-Games Solar panel Roof Hydraulic machinery Tesla coil Windows 2000

i'm tired of having a blah looking locker at school decotative ideas anyone i just have pictures up it's so boring i'm tired of staring at my locker that looked the same for years do you have any cool ideas i think i might want to use black tarp to cover up the door other than that i have no other ideas memorize your combination write down your combination twenty times once in the morning and once at night just in case you forget it write it in sharpie on the inside of your backpack you probably can't use tape or glue take everything out and clean it well with a spray make sure that there is enough room in your locker for the necessities you can decorate your whole locker so that there s no room left in it but you ll be stuck carrying around your books all day try to imagine everything that you would need to have in your locker at once all of your books your backpack your coat and personal items and then get all that stuff together and arrange it in your locker so you can see how much room you ll have to work with pick a color scheme pink and yellow red and blue your school colors pick a theme music animals dogs or cats sports cars flowers movies get a set or of brightly colored magnets you'll need plenty if you like flowers fill the inside of your locker door with a garden of artificial posies buy artificial flowers and remove the flower heads from their stems glue them to magnets with hot glue and stick them on the inside of your locker door stick a flower scented air freshener beneath the upper shelf to add realistic scent to your flower filled locker install your background if that locker look doesn t go with your theme create a fresh looking canvas by using wrapping paper or construction paper that is cut to cover the entire door or walls of the locker you can also try wallpaper but unless you get the kind that is specifically designed for lockers don t actually glue it in use magnets you can cut a cardboard or better corkboard piece to fit the back and sides individually after you fitted it tightly in the back cover the cardboard cover it in fabric insert bulletin board pins into it and put it at the back of your locker with its sides covering the sides of your locker as well it should be a tight fit use sticky tack to help it stick this becomes your bulletin board to post reminders for tests and homework assignments add a plastic cup cut off the back of it to the board for holding pens add accessories little extras like a mirror a notepad a pencil holder or a clock can be installed in your locker for convenience it s best to install these right after your background so you can plan your decorations around them i've seen ready made mirrors but don't settle for a plain and boring locker mirror jazz up an ordinary locker mirror by trimming it with decorative add ons glue on colorful feathers sequins faux jewels shells polished stones or any other cool embellishments you want another idea for decorating a locker mirror involves trimming it with glitter protect the mirror with a sheet of paper before beginning and protect your work surface with newspaper coat the frame with spray on adhesive and sprinkle it with fine glitter in a color of your choice you ll have a really cool decorative framed mirror for your locker and no one else will have one exactly like yours mirrors fall down if someone slams their locker and it doesn't even have to be you so use a strong magnet and have the mirror in an accident free area how about a wire basket to hold pens hairbrush hygiene products perfume and other small items they have the magnets on the back i've seen them in target office supply stores you can also buy 'peel and stick magnetic sheets in hobby areas of stores or michael's hobby lobby lowe's you can buy magnetic photo frames to slide photos in you can buy a scented air freshener for a nice scent if it as a sticky place on the back replace with a small piece of the magnetic sheet i'd have a memo pad up for do not forget reminders or hang a calendar big enough to write on make a little mailbox out of a small box hung on the inside of the locker place it so that people can stick notes into it through the locker slats if you have them put up some of your favorite quotes for quotes go to a scrapbook store there you can find cute quotes that are all decorated and pretty get some magnetic strips and attach them to the backs of the quote you could try hanging things from ribbon instead of sticking them pin things onto the ribbon that you tie from the top of your locker space or on the clothes purse hook mix it up you can keep the same theme all year or you can redo parts of it or the whole thing from time to time consider making seasonal changes or decorating your locker for holidays or important events keep it interesting all year long don't bring your cell phone to school and leave it on or in your locker don't keep more than in your locker if you do there would be a good chance that most or all of it would be stolen never tell anyone your locker combination someone even your friends could backstab you make sure no one is watching you use the combination locker magazines pictures internet photos school photos etc cardboard board wallpaper construction paper etc for lining locker stickers locker shelf magnets fabric scraps cleaning materials for scrubbing out locker air freshener mirror notepad bulletin board pins pencil holder clock something that's your favorite color that just says you locker kit that has many things on this list in it to save time and money maybe some corkboard make sure to measure your locker before you put it in though make a to do list for your day and week tthe calendar may have enough room for it just keep it up to date your list should remind you of papers tests projects meetings mark those items as things you absolutely must get done that day and pursue those tasks relentlessly until you get them done mark them off as you are successful clean your locker out once a week maybe every friday throw old food away  Kitchen Elevator Dairy Lincoln Continental Porsche 993 Hell's Kitchen (television) In-N-Out Burger Dishwasher

refinishing built in cabinet so i've been sanding a big built in cabinet basically like a dining room hutch that used to be in our kitchen it's so old it has the flour and sugar bins built in our house was built in my question is if i want to stain it again do i have to sand it down to pristine wood or can i simply remove the top layers of the old stain right now there is a shade difference between areas that have been sanded with a power sander and the areas i have had to do by hand we plan on staining it really dark so i'm wondering if it will take and if there will be a huge color difference if i don't have it all matching before we start staining i don't mind if it ends up having some character but i don't want it to look horrible any advice would be welcome oh and the areas i have done by hand feel like wood now but its the color difference i was wondering about no you don't have to take it down to bare wood and yes it will give the piece added character as long as you've removed any varnish or wax that would block the stain stain away if you need to even up the tone simply leave the stain on longer in those areas especially in a functional piece like you've described i think an old piece of furniture cabintery should look old be proud of that time worn patina  Porosity Bathing Dialysis Diode Pottery Textile manufacturing Bong The Inside Top-bar hive Casting Knife Soil pH Sento Otitis externa Dishwasher Drill bit Fecal incontinence Poker jargon Upholstery Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Second Battle of the Atlantic Asbestos Alum Motor oil USS Wasp (CV-7) Tobacco Sauna Internal ballistics Neutrino Sin City Betting (poker) Tooth Australian constitutional law Floppy disk Climbing equipment Hemp Chair Sewage treatment Domestic water system Hard water Dishwashing Shotgun Sodium hypochlorite Carbon dioxide Soap Professional wrestling throws Mattress Firearm Water (molecule) Gold mining Big Brother (USA TV series) Magic (illusion) Gramophone record Mineral County, West Virginia Handloading Nudity Ultramarine USS Wadsworth (DD-516) Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Strap-on dildo M60 machine gun Shoe Smoking pipe Changeroom First aid Water purification Gilding Limestone Headgear Intravenous therapy Jackass: The Movie Solar system Stucco Tuff Siegfried Line Grog Ethidium bromide Air pollution Flue gas desulfurization Tiberium Mesothelioma Tooth enamel Citric acid Psycho Hydroponics M16 (rifle) Vinegar Theory of conduct Computer virus Columbine High School massacre Psychiatric hospital Sugar beet Hard disk Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Professional wrestling match types Asset Team Fortress Classic Caving Futurama (TV series - season 3)

i want to repair a kitchen ceiling so is it better to nail the plasterboard to the joists or screw it would be best to use screws because it helps prevent the weight of the board from pulling out and causing sags in the ceiling nails may hold for a good while but eventually some pull and sag will occur if you must nail the board at least use nails for sheetrock which have a ringed shank to allow better grip good luck  Wood router Table saw Stairway Flight controls Drill bit Heinkel He 100 Straight-6 Radio controlled airplane Lathe Pottery Saw Reamer Antenna (radio) Straight engine Diamond cut Renault 25 Triangle C plus plus Bookbinding Mitsubishi Eclipse Chainsaw Circle Dipole antenna Lawn mower DNA Transformer Mazda Miata Colours, standards and guidons Roller skating Bicycle frame Alkane Helicopter Angle Grinding wheel Sundial Mazda MX-6 Rigging Ford Mustang String trimmer Miter saw Woodworking Ford Cortina Volleyball Mooney M20 Springfield 1903 rifle Windsurfing Knife Lighting Inertial guidance system Plane (tool) Wood Microphone Wildcat cartridge Sailing C programming language Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution Shaper Astrodynamics P-61 Black Widow Volkswagen Jetta Sawfiler Fashion design Textile manufacturing Nissan 240SX Strap-on dildo Ford Crown Victoria Go (board game) Equine conformation Breaststroke Avro Arrow Fixed-wing aircraft Temporal bone Ford Galaxie Honda Prelude Radar Centrifugal force Polarization STS-61 Wrench Buick Trigonometric function Handloading Milling machine Amateur telescope making Tide B__zier curve History of telescopes Dodge Neon Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Capital (architecture) Pontiac Trans Sport Swingout Taikyoku shogi Fishing rod Billiards Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Glossary of nautical terms Geodesy

removing union between pump and filter help i am trying to replace a yr old pool pump with a new hayward hp unit i need a recommendation on how to remove the union that connects the pump to the de filter my issues is that when i turn the union assuming counter clockwise is correct and also having another wrench securing the threadeded side connected to the filter the threaded side connecting to the pump will tighten until it cannot go anymore if the union piece is only supposed to turn then let me know otherwise the hacksaw is comming out to seperate the pieces lol also thinking of using strong flex tubing clamps to connect once i remove additional info if i replace with another union can i buy this from home depot is the standard inch can i use pvc what you are describing sounds like a coupling and not a union it also sounds a little like there isn't even a coupling only a piece of pipe between the two take both the pump and filter off the stand as an assembly one of the parts has to be able to turn completely around this shouldn't be to hard as there are probably some mounting screws holding both the pump and or the filter to a base take both parts off the base remove the filter remove the pipe throw away the pump connect the pipe to the new pump connect the filter to the pipe align the pump and filters to the mounting holes and re attach the assembly to the mounting bracket then connect the power to the pump and check for leaks make sure you use some pipe dope of teflon tape on the threads one last note make sure you leave about a turn in the tight direction on the filter after you screw down your pump then turn the filter in the tight direction to the proper position this will ensure your filter is in the proper postion and the joints are tight no leaks hope this helps  Glass Drill bit Saw Window Boat building Amateur telescope making Weapon Woodworking Snooker Wood router Lawn mower Chisel Textile manufacturing Bong Windows Vista Wood carving Sunroof Obsidian Compact disc Stereoscopy Drawing Diamond simulant 35 mm film Screw Grind Movie projector Parachute STS-114 Radio controlled airplane Textile manufacturing terminology Bicycle frame View camera Spark plug Jute Portsmouth Block Mills Sandpaper Door Stained glass MPEG-2 Fencing Digital Signal 1 Upholstery Panoramic photography Solar power Mattress Lightning rod Electrical wiring Lathe Chopper (motorcycle) Sextant Cube (film) Scissors Stage lighting Laser engraving Lapping Harp EIA-708 Glasses Toilet paper Bowie knife Computer animation Axe Razor Floppy disk Naval mine Ethernet Lighting Die (manufacturing) Float glass Glossary of firefighting equipment Page table Anaglyph image Table tennis Widescreen Gramophone record Timpani Packet Adze Bedbug Cinematography RX-78 mobile suit series Photographic lens Comanche PaX Filter (optics) Crown glass Plough RuneScape Random Events Plastic Hand grenade Table saw Tire Photograph Seismometer Snowboard GIF Time-division multiplexing Chevrolet Corvette Sword

how much is reasonable for wilsonart laminate countertops per square foot i went to lowes and it was sf and at a private contractor it was all big box stores use private contractors to install the products that they sell lowes and home depot basically just take your order and forward it on to thier installers manufacturers to handle and they probably mark up the countertops per square foot just to do that if you can locate a reputable counter manufacturer in your area and know how to speak intellegently construction lingo to them you will get a better price by just going direct in any instance when you get a qoute or see a price tag for countertops that is for a straight run of countertop with standard front edge details if you have bends cut outs above standard backsplash or edge details or some of the better color patterns you will increase your costs but a basic solid color laminate straight run countertop should be about per square foot including a backsplash then your cost will go up from there  Drill bit Wood router Lathe Woodworking Lathe (metal) Table saw Computer-aided design CNC Router Lawn mower Central processing unit Computer-aided manufacturing Saw Multiprotocol Label Switching Radio controlled airplane Table tennis Plywood Knife Virtual memory Rail terminology Wi-Fi PowerPC Textile manufacturing Skateboarding trick Digital circuit Numerical control Welding Wire wrap Screw Violin Drill Grinding machine History of computing hardware Swingout Milling machine Mouse (computing) Telegraphy Internal ballistics TRS-80 Metalworking Fan (implement) Floppy disk Chess Equine conformation Timber framing Computer Laser engraving Pinball Manual transmission Plane (tool) Streaming media Wind turbine Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Transistor Fabrication (metal) Bass guitar Carburetor Seismic retrofit Boat building Elevator Railroad switch Canoe Brewery Computer numbering formats IBM 1620 Helicopter Modem Network address translation Control character RISC Opera (web browser) AmigaOS Linux Turing machine Glossary of firefighting equipment Integrated circuit View camera Enigma machine Routing Atari 8-bit family Voice over IP Paper size Skype Microprocessor M-209 M60 machine gun Octopus card Strap-on dildo Lighting Guitar 64-bit Pickup truck

starting a large do it yourself floor tiling project first time attempting got any tips certainly the free workshops are a good beginning and a better experience than trying to interpret from text and two dimensional pictures i just answered a tile q at length i'll explain again at least my proces i square the room meaning determine in that space whether or not the room actually corners at degree angles i measure to a center point and snap two perpendicular lines squared to each other i lay out a course or two of the chosen tile that allows adjustment in the center point to the perimeters for cuts my thought is when possible have the perimeter cuts equal at least at the two opposing walls then if you happened to be using inch tiles for example you add lose inches for every ft in a layout meaning that even in a ft room you'd still have to make a perimeter cut or two i do that before ever mixing the first bucket of mortar without knowing your sub floor or its condition or transition areas it's difficult to detail prepping that but it certainly should be in your plan once i've taken the time to get the layout figured and the aesthetics in order then i can begin setting and i save all my cuts for last i also remove any cove base molding and allow in my plan that the tile will end with at least the same inch space as the grout lines then after the fact re install the cove base for door molding it's a simple matter of a back saw used with a piece of tile as a shim for the height i'm in the process of re doing sq ft that was poorly installed years ago and i mumble every day lol steven wolf  Trebuchet Wood Lumber Diving Timeline of alternative rock Yacht Peanuts USS Tautog (SS-199) Extreme Programming Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Drill bit Straw-bale construction Grand Central Terminal Passchendaele Pumpkin Siege USS Trigger (SS-237) Decompression sickness RuneScape quests Robot Master USS Vestal (AR-4) Iowa class battleship Hot air balloon USS Whale (SS-239) Shot of Love Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority The Smashing Pumpkins Steel Dundas Square Mercury Atlas 6 Poker jargon West Side Highway Cerritos, California Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Architecture of the California missions Industrial Workers of the World Vladimir Peter Tytla Rise of Nations Harp Tai shogi Ship model STS-114 Wrigley Field Four wheel drive Breath of Fire III Taikyoku shogi Glossary of American football Light-frame construction Sears Catalog Home Natural building Battle of the Somme (1916) Kansas Chess strategy and tactics Phase (matter) Wright brothers Plane (tool) Battleship U.S. Highway 66 Dilbert Aviation history Lathe Station wagon Marching band Medicine IBM PC compatible Truck Portland cement USS Tunny (SS-282) EastEnders McDonald's Panama Canal Locks Junk (ship) My Life as a Teenage Robot Autonomic nervous system Russell T.

how do you build a flying fox in your backyard we have a large garden with a treehouse high up and another large tree which has some lower branches roughly metres away how would we build a flying fox between the two trees what would we need to do it where could we get the equipment and how much would it cost depending on how long the equipment is going to be left in place permanent temperary also depending on your budget best first using a nylon sling of sufficient length to fit around the tree where you are fixing the attachment points this is preferable to be flat webbed strapping so as not to cut into the tree and preferable to have manufactured loops at either end the sling is shackled together at the loops with galvanised d shackle of approxiamately mm or greater if the strap is wound around the tree trunk limb once first before the ends are shackled then this will assist in the strap from moving too much on the tree to these shackle points you fit a rope that is to be the main runner of the flying fox preferably made of silver nylon or better check with rope supplier this should be of say mm or better rope rope is measured in cicumference the best way of fitting this rope is to splice both ends in a loop so as to fit into a shackle the rope is then tensioned at the top end with a large turnbuckle galvanised of at least mm note this turnbuckle should be loosened after each day period of use so as not to put undue strain on the trees and or removed in a storm situation as it could help in moving the tree purchase a suitable snap block stainless steel is better this is usually from a ships chandeler etc should be the correct size for the main rope and of capable weight loading for more than kg depending on the sling arrangement for the seat etc it is better to have a loop or ringed pulley than a hooked type this will not allow the drop rope sling to fall of any hook in general only have a slight downward slope gradient on the main rope do not have the snap block pulley within reach of little fingers do have a safety rope or breaking system for the rider so as not to hit the lower of the support trees etc in all construction make sure safety is paramount use helmets and gloves hope this helps later jim  Teen Girl Squad Shen Gong Wu The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Jon Secada Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling attacks Bomberman Cincinnati Bengals RuneScape quests Poker jargon Escape from New York Bob and George Shaggy dog story The Time Machine Professional wrestling holds New York Giants Tank GunZ The Duel Treehouse of Horror III Toyota Prius Social rule Eye Final Fantasy magic Autostereogram Volleyball Castle Wars Items in the Metroid series Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Equine conformation Stereoscopy Midnight Run Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Motorcycle helmet The Inside Whose Line Is It Anyway?

can't unscrew my showerhead hi i want to change my showerhead but i can't for the life of me unscrew it i've tried with wrenches and it doesn't even budge i think i've even scraped up the side of the nut because it's too tight it looks like there is a white seal in the threads any advice on how to get this darn thing off thanks in advance you must be careful when doing this as you do not want to loosen the pipe joints behind the wall make sure you use one wrench to back up the the wrench you are using to twist off the shower head place the backup wrench on the pipe behind the head and apply pressure in a clockwise direction now with the wrench on the shower head turn the wrench in a counter clockwise direction if it will not loosen perhaps you need a longer wrench to get more leverage use a pipe wrench they tighten as you apply pressure hope it works for you  Portland cement Mortar (masonry) Plaster Casting Stucco Pottery Incineration Calcium Calcium oxide Cement Explosive material Gypsum Masonry Ultramarine Steel Titanium Calcium hydroxide Aluminium Silicon Magnesium Metallurgy Glass Tofu Kiln Silicon dioxide Sand Calcium carbonate Iron Brick Alum Architecture of the California missions Welding Industrial process Sintering Mineral Sulfur Pozzolana Straw-bale construction Terrazzo Caliche Eifel Aqueduct Soil pH Weathering Fire extinguisher Quartzite Drywall Natural building Adobe Aluminium oxide Tile Coffee Plastic Ammonia Dam Hard water Reinforced concrete Corrosion Arch bridge Rust Drill bit Bauxite Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area Aggregate (composite) Toothpaste Igneous rock Compost Building material Plutonium Mission San Juan Capistrano Diamond simulant Pavement (material) Diatomaceous earth Salt Turquoise Soap Alabaster Timeline of materials technology Bridge Fly ash Marble Shotcrete Limestone Gas tungsten arc welding Concretion Tungsten Pozzolanic ash Glossary of sculpting terms Water purification Cerium Coal Glaze Chromatography Blast furnace Shell (projectile) Tuff Sugar Thermite

any suggestions answers fixing a porcerain on steel tub cosmetic i think we are renters that live paycheck to paycheck so unfourtunately we have to budget accordingly we're just trying to figure out an inexpensive way to refurbish our tub that we think is a steel attached to the wall standard tub with a porcelain veneer we're trying to fix rust and general stains to the tub as well as chips to the porcelain some quite large any help you can paint the tub with an epoxy based resinous paint the paint comes in different collers and its consists of two containers one which contains the base and the other contains the activation agent you mix them both together according to the directions and paint it onto the tub with a brush make sure you follow the manufacturers directions otherwise if the mix ratio is not perfect it will lose its strengh and maybe even not dry it should be applied fairly quick since it toughens fast aesthetically it wouldn't be great it would vary depending on ur painting skills but it will seal the tub and it will give it a glossy finish that is highly resistant to scratching  Characters of Naruto Waste management George Burns Rave party Marie Antoinette Hell The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Alaga__sia Dustbin Incineration Anne Boleyn Dean Koontz Shaggy dog story Garfield Roger Ebert's most hated films W.I.T.C.H.

can somone tell me how to wire v lighting from a buss bar in series with switches lights total i have high pressre sodium lights i need to put up in my shop i have a buss bar with v made by bulldog i want to hook into a pull box and run power to three switchs as lights will work off one switch so i need i diagram or some advice i know what you're trying to do you have lamps that run on volts dividing it up in phases would be lamps on each phase that would total v phase to phase delta if wired in series it doesn't work that way i think wiring high pressure sodium lights in series is the craziest idea i've ever heard of these lamps have a ballast and a starter board that kicks the voltage for the bulb up to above volts to fire up once fired up the operating voltage actually drops down to about volt measured across the bulb socket with the unused voltage power rejected by the ballast you cannot wire these lights in series they need to get the proper voltage what they are made for and nothing else my wildest guess is that you would blow one starter board after another once you turn the switch on also the weakest bulb would burn out in a heartbeat you'd be constantly changing bulbs if this would work at all i should try this some day and laugh myself silly about it when it all blows up final advice let an electrician do this this is nothing to play with v hurts real bad i wouldn't want that to happen again you never know when it is the last time on second thought is this one of these tricks growers of particular plants are using to hide the power draw of their growing lights to be detected by the kw hour meter i know very well that very very strange things occur if you create a capacitive and inductive load with the addition of half wave rectifiers on a phase to phase circuit like the meter stopping or even turning backwards  Casting Epoxy Paint Pottery Knife Dishwasher Plastic Welding Varnish Electric motor Glaze Bassoon Brush Stainless steel Boat building Glass Masonry Polystyrene Seismic retrofit Bicycle frame Gas metal arc welding Cookware and bakeware Carbon fiber Corrosion Internal ballistics Slide rule Model aircraft Printed circuit board Transformer Terminal ballistics Lacquer Textile manufacturing Fan (implement) Turquoise Microeconomics De Lorean DMC-12 Woodworking Polypropylene Radio controlled airplane Friction Upholstery Wind turbine Gilding Wallpaper group Paintball Light-emitting diode Drawing Operational amplifier Painter and decorator Aluminium Shoe polish Chinese art Organic peroxide Solar cell Iron Professional wrestling match types Screw Arcade cabinet Bicycle Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Magnetism Graphite-reinforced plastic Electrical wiring Wood carving Eyepiece Fiberglass Golden ratio Billiards Dental caries Seal (device) Bong Stucco Brewery Rail transport modelling Thermal power station Dishwashing Handloading Leica Floppy disk Soldering CPU cache Poker jargon Scale model China Steel Cartridge (firearms) Clarinet Tofu Electrophysiology Tire Diamond cut Canoe Ice cream Antenna (radio) Hydraulic machinery Strap-on dildo Lighting

how do you put out incense without the ashes flying all over the place i use a lighter and light them and ashes fly everywhere when i try to put them out you can put it out under water however if you burn your incense in a censer a bowl dish or ash tray sort of thing and put sand it in then when you are finished you can turn the incense over and push the ember down into the sand to snuff it out then you can pull it out later and relight it again for coil incense you can break off the burning ember and drop it into water  Universal Serial Bus Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Jack plug IPod Secure Digital card Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Spark plug USB flash drive Strap-on dildo Game Boy Advance SP TRS connector Professional wrestling throws Telephone exchange Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Ron and Fez Atari ST Membrane potential Windows 2000 Digital Subscriber Line Fuse (electrical) Verizon Wireless Radio controlled airplane Action potential Erotic electrostimulation Modem Opie and Anthony Telephone tapping Copy protection TIA-568A/B Japanese toilet Wheel of Fortune Toyota Prius M16 (rifle) Residual-current device Volt Three-phase electric power Electrophysiology Lithium ion battery Simpsons couch gag RISC Surveillance Drill bit SCART Category 5 cable Professional wrestling holds Xbox 360 Modchip Current (electricity) Beavis and Butt-head Liquid crystal display 24 (television) Btrieve Programmable logic controller USS Thresher (SS-200) Electricity meter Ignition system Papa's Got a Brand New Badge Earring Xbox Colt Commando Sinclair ZX81 Power line communication Commodore 64 Registered jack Thermal power station High-voltage hazards Electrician Suplex RS-232 D-subminiature Direct current Bed (furniture) Electricity pylon Kalarippayattu Danger Hiptop Ammunition Cheating in Counter-Strike Windows Me Matt Hardy Acanthocephala Model aircraft Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster STS-61 Phreaking Boxing Teletext The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular IPod shuffle Dreadlocks Solar cell BS 1363 Key telephone system Spark gap MSN Messenger Advanced Technology Attachment Digital rights management Aluminium Apollo Command/Service Module Joke

cockroaches in my mr coffee i am a real slob thats why it started i noticed my first one who always came out the top of my mr coffee now i think their in the eggs etc wirring in the bottem though i do see little ones scamper when i pull the grate out and across to remove the basket for the filter this type of mc has a carafe that need no heat from the bottem so the coffee does not burn away in it i do not want to look for another since my money is tight i know to keep kitchen clean though it may not i don't want to use chemicals since they could go back to the coffeemaker now the colony is bigger seeing more mature dudes in other places i know that i probably will need a new coffeemaker if i am serious about getting rid of them is there a problem if i drink very small cockroaches in my coffee lol thank you i am sorta immune to them in an abcentminded attitude since i lived in an old house at college where there were millions that was a long time ago well ew okay now that i got that out how about putting the mr coffee into the freezer overnight let it return to room temperature before running it and watch for condensation that could cause shorting in the wires the freezing temperature may kill the roaches then i'd run a batch of the vinegar water coffee maker cleaning solution it's just white vinegar run through the coffee maker i guess the only problem i foresee in ingesting cockroach babies or eggs would be if they have been sprayed by or have come into contact with an insecticide then you are drinking some of those chemicals when you include those bugs in your brew cheers to a healthy immune system  Band saw Lathe Circular saw Knife Portsmouth Block Mills Wood router Welding Tire Antenna (radio) Guitar Wood carving Movie projector Violin Internal ballistics Sawfiler Fabrication (metal) Gramophone record Metalworking Stairway Textile manufacturing Sword Floppy disk Lawn mower Backsaw Wallpaper group Uniform Resource Locator Machining Casting Shaper P-61 Black Widow Mouse (computing) Heraldry Timpani Milling machine Screw Rail terminology World Wide Web Drill Planetary orbit Forge Tractor Chainsaw VHF omnidirectional range Domain Name System Sawmill Chisel Plane (tool) Japanese tea ceremony Hand saw Fractal Pottery Mars Exploration Rover Wood Radio controlled airplane Figure skating Manifold O scale Open cluster Geodesy Elbow-joint Elevator Bicycle Einstein-Cartan theory Transformer Radar Circuit design Sewing machine Wiki Vise (tool) Bicycle brake systems Website Slashdot trolling phenomena New York City Subway Phonograph Lapping Canal lock Helicopter Rail tracks Oscilloscope File (metalwork) Seismometer Humerus Milling cutter Laser engraving Mandrel Quotation mark Hangul Axe

attaching brick to studs ok so ive given myself a project to build a shelter barn shed well see what it turns out like then see what we can use it for so i can lay bricks for the walls of this barn but how do i attach the upright wood studs to the brick is there anything inbetween i need to know about or can the wooden studs be attached to the brick wall just by concrete screws the rest i have knowledge on like electric plastering but im just stuck on this part i dont wanna start building and end up in a pickle mid way my knowledge is on building is pretty intermidate i ghuess you could say many thanks in advance well for a shed you dont really need to have a timber frame you can just have double brick wall with piers and then you can have your rafters sitting on the brick wall cavities are mainly for protecting the building from moisture but if its not an inhabited building you can just have structural brick walls the rule is you cant have a freestanding brick wall that exceeds square meters so place ur piers as required at the end of the day the most important thing would be ur slab  LaTeX Condom Casting Paint Menstrual cup Primer (paint) Mattress Percy Schmeiser Car wash Tattoo Strap-on dildo Fire fighting Markup language Japanese tea ceremony All My Children Diving suit Carbon fiber Gas metal arc welding Rubber Concrete Brewery Microphone Asbestos First aid M16 (rifle) Radio controlled airplane Herbicide Weed control Geodesic dome Balloon Christmas tree Two-stroke cycle Processor register Latex Toilet paper Gesso Diaphragm (contraceptive) Urban beach TeX Ice rink 64-bit Curling Fume hood Cartridge (firearms) Nitroglycerin Air pollution Distributed computing Trumpet Bullet Airport Endowment (Mormonism) Cave diving Pessary Paper plane Coir Explosive material Fancy rat Thermal power station Dry cleaning Chewing gum DNA polymerase Handloading Air traffic control Carburetor Electrostatic precipitator Autonomous building White phosphorus incendiary Pastel Aluminium Diseases of the honeybee Ira Steven Behr Chromatography Lignin Opium Internal ballistics Dundas Square Hand grenade Friction Soap Vinegar Cell (biology) Fisting Yoko Ono Arcade cabinet Butt plug Mixing console Jason Behr Blue Man Group Canary Ryan's Hope Pinoy Big Brother IA-32 Information warfare Medical prescription Hard disk Earth's atmosphere Sex doll Ozone layer RISC Exxon Valdez oil spill

how to rid ants i have little redish ants all over my pc desk i never eat or drink by it soo i don't know y they are here i am not able to spend very much to get ride of them any low income ideas please would be great i do have kids simple all natural non toxic formula oatmeal you just by old fashioned oatmeal not the instant kind also called rolled oats you sprinkle a handful where the ants will find them preferably close to the hill if you know where it is because it takes them forever to haul it back home they take the raw rolled oats to the queen she eats it and then not kidding she blows up and then they wander off having no purpose left in life it takes a couple of days to see results but then you see less ants in a couple of days and pretty soon they're all gone i've done this several times and i'd swear by it four out of five times it's worked like a charm the fifth time i had to do two different applications because a new colony came and took over the vacated hill but then they left too i can't guarantee it works on all types of ants though since i've only ever tried it on black ants but it can't hurt anything to try and it won't hurt your kids if they come up and start eating it my five year old sister likes to eat rolled oats raw  Clothing Kilt Textile manufacturing terminology Undergarment Skirt and dress Suit (clothes) Shirt Comanche Mattress Textile manufacturing Kimono Diamond cut Salwar kameez Chemise Knife Knitting Violin Playoff Pattern (sewing) Sarong Starfleet ranks and insignia Han Chinese clothing Bob Jones University Horse Academic dress of Oxford University Teen Girl Squad Heavy metal fashion Mario Stocking Dairy Order of the Garter Aloha shirt Quilting Glossary of American football Quilt Whose Line Is It Anyway?

what is the difference between mortar and grout good question i had to pull some books off my shelf because this one peaked my curiosity there is a fair amount of ambiguity with these terms and i ve heard them used interchangeably all of the above responses seem right but from an engineering perspective i pulled this information from one of my books mortar is used for the following functions bonding masonry units together serving as a seating material for the units leveling and seating the units and providing aesthetic quality of the structure grout is used to fill the cores or voids in hollow masonry units for the purpose of bonding the masonry units bonding the reinforcing steel to the masonry increasing the bearing area increasing the fire resistance and improving the overturning resistance by increasing the weight using these definitions grout uses fine gravel in addition to the sand both mixes use the other ingredients seem similar with minor portioning differences  Portland cement Mortar (masonry) Concrete Stucco Pavement (material) Cement Calcium Aggregate (composite) Pozzolana Sand Concrete mixer Building material Gravel Fly ash Ceramics Caliche Natural building Asphalt concrete Plaster Viscosity Desert Rammed earth Shotcrete Hydraulic conductivity Lincoln Highway Roman road Architecture of the California missions Pozzolanic ash Cliffe-at-Hoo Incineration Aquifer Casting Sedimentary rock Bonsai Tile Dune Fr__d__ric Chopin Volcanic ash Erosion Graveler Silicon Reinforced concrete Trinidad and Tobago Alkane Sediment Iligan City Dorset Sandstone London Clay Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area Opportunity rover Silicon dioxide Steel Clastic Arch bridge Geography of Lithuania Tuff Paul Muldoon Bar (landform) Misi__n San Miguel Arc__ngel de la Frontera Gold mining Japanese garden Dam Placer mining Armor-piercing shot and shell Sand Martin Sandbag Pachypodium habitats Cemex Wellingborough Glacier Pottery Open-pit mining Geology of Hertfordshire Petroleum Aztalan State Park, Wisconsin Fire extinguisher Ferrofluid Atlantic Ocean Geology of the Alps Quartzite Flea Greywacke Maya civilization River delta Geography of the United Kingdom Plutonium Geology of the British Isles Pisco Paint Geodesic dome Motor oil Sulfur Athabasca Oil Sands Carburetor A151 road Titanium Till Carbon dioxide

how to paint a high ceiling in a stairwell the basement stairs to the house has a really high ceiling and it's painted a horrid shade of dirty pink even with an extension on a roller i cannot reach it and how would i even get into the corners my tallest ladder is not tall enough and it's scary to contemplate trying to lean the ladder against the back wall setting on one of the steps how do painters reach a really high ceiling when directly below it are steps leading down help how do painters do it they have longer poles than you they have taller ladders they have configurable ladders that can be used to create platforms where one leg is shorter than the other to accommodate the stairs go to the home depot and take a look at configurable ladders they aren't cheap at about but they do let you create nice scaffolding on the stairs from there you can use a shorter pole or get a longer ladder keep in mind that the safest thing you can do is have the bottom of the ladder pushed up against a stair or the wall many people don't trust a ladder on stairs but if it's wedged into the stair it's not going anywhere i have the same situation and when i'm ready to paint this part of my house i might pop for a pro paint what you can yourself and spend the money on a few specific jobs where you simply cannot do it  Kitchen Refrigerator Frankfurt kitchen IPod Knife Drill bit Israel's unilateral disengagement plan De Lorean DMC-12 Gas metal arc welding Internet Welding Mattress Dishwasher Solar cell Viva La Bam Dairy Best Buy Electrical wiring World Wide Web Battery (electricity) Cookware and bakeware Bad Wolf Panzer I Passenger car Steel Wire Krag-J__rgensen De Lorean Motor Company Xbox 360 RuneScape quests Japanese toilet Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis PlayStation 3 Uniform Resource Locator Hydrogen economy Nintendo Apollo Command/Service Module R46 (New York City Subway car) Yacht Toyota Camry Brewery Cathedral of Learning Oplan Bojinka HyperText Transfer Protocol Mutual fund Transformation problem Naval mine XML Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Stainless steel Microeconomics Elevator Pioneer Zephyr Thermal power station Tire Suspension bridge Titanium Experiment Home Box Office Berkshire Hathaway RISC Externality Barbed wire Piano Nintendo 64 Common Agricultural Policy EMD F3 Lionel Corporation Baldness BS 1363 Common Unix Printing System Harp Electrophysiology Vacuum Web crawler The Brady Bunch Supply and demand Economics Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Enron Corporation Columbine High School massacre Tao Te Ching Geodesic dome Baroque chess View camera Electronic commerce Poker jargon Rigging Hell's Kitchen (television) Ethernet Porsche 911 Audiophile Dundas Square Telegraphy Stock Spark plug M16 (rifle) Transformer

looking for a good website w pics for replacing water shutoff valve under sink i replaced my kitchen faucet and in the process knocked some deposits off of the cold water shutoff valve under the faucet it now slowly leaks plus it's old and crappy i tried locating a good website to explain how to replace a shutoof vavle and got frustrated im looking for a site with pictures and good descriptions specifically i want to go to the hardware store once what tools do i need the new valve of course do i need a pipe cutter should i cut directly beneath the valve or just remove the valve and replace it without cutting for a novice if you can remove the valve with wrences turn off the water and do this and take the valve to the store and ask for equivalent otherwise determine size of pipe by measuring around with a string buy a compression fitted valve to match pipe size using the string turn off water cut pipe at each end of valve with a pipe cutter the cutter should leave edges smooth put the ends of the old pipe into the openings of the compression fitting and tighten with a pair of wrenches if you don't have these you may be able to borrow but a true diyer would have these around and true diyers would be willing to go to the hardware store more than once if they are not very far away and then tighten some more if you have a rubber hose connection at the end of the valve that goes to the faucet you would need to instead buy a valve with a compression fitting at one end and the male connector that fits the rubber hose at the other you may just want to replace the connection to the faucet with a hose anyway and then go this route there are cheaper ways to go if you have soldering know how and materials but if this is the only plumbing you will do then this may be best alternative  Casting Polymerase chain reaction Art Paint Upholstery Epoxy Stucco Painter and decorator Light-emitting diode Lead paint Manicure Primer (paint) Glass Rose Poker jargon Pastel Color Collecting fossils Handloading Color theory Blue Wood carving L.

what do you know about re finishing hardwood floors my apartment has hardwood floors and they are not attractive they are scratched dull and stained i want to fix them myself can anyone give me some insight it is a small apartment certainly no more than sq ft what materials will i need what will i actually have to do and how much time will it take also what costs can i expect any details anyone can give me would be great thank you so much my landlord is paying for it i am not stupid why can't people just answer the question and not assume things that aren't even asked you should rent a floor sander the square type at a building supply place such as lowe's or home depot they run about dollars a day probably depends on where you live buy sanding sheets starting with a coarse one then a finer one they are about each and you will probably need or so of each get extra ones they will refund your money for the ones you don't need you will probably spend around dollars on the sanding you will also need a hand held block sander or sheets of sandpaper to hand sand around the edges before you start sanding be sure that there aren't any nail heads or splinters sticking out that will tear your sanding pads start sanding in a out of way spot until you get the hang of it it isn't hard so don't worry sand with the grain of the wood not across the boards be sure to empty the bag of saw dust as often as the machine says too after you sand the floor with the machine first using the coarse paper then the fine take your block sander or sheets of sandpaper and hand sand any edges that your machine couldn't get too or any stubborn spots when you are through sweep vacuum and go over the floor with tack cloth to be sure that you don't have any saw dust left on it now you should decide if you want to stain it or just go with the natural look it will be lighter if you don't stain it but the polyurthane will make it darker than it is before you apply it this is the look that i prefer you can buy small sized cans of stain apply each to a small area as well as applying just polyurthane to a spot and let them dry while you still have the sander choose which finish you want and when it it dry sand over that area again to remove the ones you didn't like again remove any sawdust and go buy your stain and apply it with a brush just like you would paint be careful not to over lap the edges so you won't have darker stripes after hours you should be able to apply the clear polyurthane but be sure that the floor isn't still tacky if it is rainy out sometimes it takes longer to dry apply a coat of polyurthane let it dry hours and lightly hand sand the floor again removing any dust when you are done apply a second coat and let it dry probably hours and you are done it isn't really hard and the results are amazing have fun and good luck  Glossary of firefighting equipment Wrench Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Hydraulic machinery Tap (valve) Diving regulator Spark plug Plumbing fixture Tire Irrigation Bong Flush toilet Drill bit Trombone Soldering Home repair Domestic water system Scuba set Oxyacetylene Fire hydrant Air brake (rail) Mattress Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Seismic retrofit Siphon Electrophysiology Rail terminology Diving suit Plastic Welding Computer Vacuum tube Glossary of firefighting terms Sento Dairy Rebreather Two-stroke cycle E85 Violin Sleeve valve Dialysis Textile manufacturing Gasoline Transistor Radio controlled car Universal Serial Bus Steam engine Anchor Glossary of wildland fire terms Kitchen Toilet paper Energy development Hard water Solar power Geographic information system Manifold vacuum William Murdoch Carbon dioxide Electronic amplifier Lock picking Mouse (computing) Metalworking Milling cutter CPU cache Furnace Table tennis Commodore 64 Diamond Internal combustion engine Circuit design MP3 Tap wrench Reamer Portable stove Cheating in Counter-Strike Password Electrical wiring Renewable energy Glossary of graph theory Chevrolet Corvair engine Naval mine Laserdisc Water supply Combine (Half-Life 2) Panama Canal Mercury 4 Apollo Command/Service Module Urinal

whats a good polish for metal that can really make it shiny and can reduce the appearance of scratches it depends on what type metal you are trying to polish since some metals are harder than others a good brass polish such as brasso have a mild abrasive in them that polishes the scratches out you can also use this on chrome or other polished metal as long as it is not sprayed with a clear to protect the metal from tarnishing if you don't need the mild abrasive a good car polish will give you good results go to a home improvement store and look at their cleaners and polishes i feel sure that you will find exactly what you need  Miter saw Saw Drill bit Table saw Knife Billiards French Quarter Wood carving Seismic retrofit Boat building Screw Wind turbine Wood Hockey rink Bed (furniture) Snooker Woodworking joints Spark plug Chopsticks Woodworking Papal Inauguration Violin Frame and panel Optical fiber Lonely Planet ZGMF-X12 Gundam Astray Out Frame Mitre Timber framing Nunchaku Animation Tip Woodworking machine Call centre Crochet P-61 Black Widow Wrigley Field Oxy-fuel welding and cutting 2005 NBA Finals Cleveland Browns Upholstery Stairway Barbecue Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Telescope Inertial guidance system Platform framing Assault rifle Spruce Box Boxing Lightning rod Piano Drifting (motorsport) .30-06 Springfield Langstroth hive Unreal Digital video recorder Dum-dum Halo: Combat Evolved Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Cello Terminal ballistics Dinghy Argentina Fencing Vending machine IMAX Car handling Mitral valve prolapse Doom 3 Katana Plough Alex Ferguson Thief (computer game) M4 Carbine Punch card USS Wadsworth (DD-516) Fan (implement) Oak Sundial Die (manufacturing) New England Patriots Fly fishing FreeBSD Cheating in Counter-Strike Betting (poker) Stave church Toronto Raptors Broadband Internet access Diamond Sukhoi Su-24 Electric guitar Material properties of diamond Battle of Bazentin Ridge Fabrication (metal) Tribes 2 Dilbert The Rolling Stones Lady Bouvier's Lover Radio controlled airplane

can i build a partition wall with glass blocks i am want to build a partition wall to make a large bedroom and boxroom into smaller bedrooms it is not a load bearing wall so can i use glass blocks to partition it as one of the rooms is dark and the glass block wall would add some extra light any advice another thought could i just use the glass blocks on some of the top half of a partition wall with all due respect can i depends on a few variables certainly the attempt is valid both your notions are valid as well it might also depend on the intended use of either room in as much as some privacy might be an issue i very much enjoy glass block and as a retro thing they certainly do what karma does go around and come around they can also be found in acrylic lighter in weight as durable as glass and in the same general sense with regard to patterns and privacy block is sold also with framing channels etc for installation for exterior butting walls the install is often done with a type of mortar as is the case with regular block your greatest concern might be in the stability of the wall as opposed to the weight load of it framing a block wall top bottom and sides would aid in that stability you mention of using it as a half wall might mean at some point it wasn't enough or aesthetically pleasing enough those are decisions to be made before the fact however i'd probably choose a half wall first  Seismic retrofit Spark plug Drill bit Wrench Plumbing fixture Basement Japanese toilet Soldering Naval mine Tire Kitchen Pliers Bong Residual-current device Solar power Irrigation Handloading Bathroom Knife Toilet Fecal incontinence Big Dig Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Machine tapers Toilet humour Reamer Domestic water system Elevator Rebreather Electrical wiring Menstrual cup Fast bowling Taps and dies Hydraulic machinery Monetary policy Welding The Brady Bunch Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Hogwarts Floor Directory Passenger car Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Strap-on dildo STS-51-L Washroom Glossary of firefighting terms Toilet paper Plame affair Anchor Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Ground and neutral Blood Simple Home repair Atari 8-bit family Rigging Professional wrestling holds Casting War of the Worlds (2005 film) Pipe organ Thermal power station Equine conformation Brazing STS-61 PaX Glossary of firefighting equipment Energy development Novelty (locomotive) HVAC Motor oil USS Trigger (SS-237) Uilleann pipes Soap bubble Super Mario Bros. 3 Pile Universal Serial Bus Trombone Bassoon BS 1363 Fountain pen Daniel Pipes 2000 Australian Grand Prix Electric motor Electrical wiring (UK) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Programming tool Rail terminology Happy Tree Friends Bolted joint Submarine Pottery Johnny 5 Glossary of climbing terms Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Borehole The Sims 2 First Battle of the Atlantic Urinal Dairy

need info on how to build a dog pen using chain link fence over a wood frame pictures if possible i probably wouldn't use chain link for the weight factor but i can't see a need to diagram this all you really need do is visualize a house in its rough stage of framing if you know the dimensions you want just get busy using treated x 's determine a height x width x length and build the frame chain link sold in rolls at farm stores fencing companies even hd or lowes is often ft x ft if that won't work for you then you'll have to find it in ft height using a wooden frame you'll have to use galvanized horse shoe nails perhaps depending on the dimensions you'll have to unclude support beams both upright and across any roof you might want if the dogs are jumpers you might have to enclose it anyway that would also equate if you have any zoning issues regarding animals i'd probably go with inch galvanized plumbing pipe rather than lumber for one thing it would probably outlast any dog and perhaps any owner as well cut or purchase in the sizes you need threaded at the ends adding to that degree elbows and t junctions for the supporting pipes then stretch the chain link using all the usual appropriate hardware used when putting up a chain link fence you can allow for a gate somewhere in the plan and purchase one ready made if your budget allows steven wolf  Seismic retrofit Wood Basement Antioch, Pisidia Nuclear fallout Retaining wall King Khalid International Airport Ammunition Sail-plan Masonry Freedom Tower Nuclear weapon design Bicycle frame Severe weather terminology (United States) Air-raid shelter Great Pyramid of Giza Dam Dundas Square Soil Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Natural building Water (molecule) Las Vegas metropolitan area Hydrogen economy Portable stove Tank Suspension bridge Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Wind Volleyball Civil engineering Radio masts and towers Sport utility vehicle Magnesium Environmental concerns with electricity generation Fan (implement) Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew Passenger car Isotope separation Equine conformation Geodesic dome Great Wall of China Anchor Leather Trench warfare Hobie cat Arch bridge Hubert H.

i want to fix the little dirtpatches in front of my house and of my neighbor's i have pics please help i maintain the front of both houses but i'm not good at it basically i remove all the weeds trim the bushes and remove any trash the problem that we're having with the houses is that the dirtpatches are on an incline and over many years the dirt continues to fall onto the sidewalk whenever it rains especially if it rains hard and then i have to go clean that up too i was planning on laying sod to make both sides look a lot better but i need a diy project that is relativly simple so i can build a small wall or barrier or whatever it's called to keep the dirt where it belongs what is there is not working well at all i don't mind working hard i would just like it to look relatively nice and inexpensive would be just as good when you see the pic of my house it's the one with the ridiculously big bush check out the house on the right i don't want it to come out looking as horrible as their makeshift patio thanks so much i'm about to add the pic links one moment this is my side http img imageshack us img sd jpg http img imageshack us img rq jpg http img imageshack us img rn jpg http img imageshack us img hx jpg http img imageshack us img lf jpg this is their side http img imageshack us img fj jpg http img imageshack us img nw jpg http img imageshack us img lg jpg of course i will ask my neighbors if they mind me doing the work if i actually can diy in the end your side has those rocks which have gaps and just don't do the job i suggest the type of retaining wall interlocking bricks as pictured in the link below they are a couple dollars a piece you should be able to do the job for about or less you will need to remove the dirt closest to the sidewalk to create room for the bricks if you use a spade you can cut horizontally and create a dirt wall before you place the bricks making the job that much easier i see that their side has what looks like a cement retaining wall but it's not high enough you need their wall to be a good six inches above the dirt to make the two sides compliment eachother i suggest that you add one layer of the same bricks atop their cement wall or whatever that is this added layer will also raise the wall enough for you to have room for mulch when you are finished planting and therefore the mulch won't end up on the sidewalk either then there is the question of plants because that loose dirt is the cause of the erosion and those empty patches of dirt will only encourage weeds to grow there because something will always find a way to grow where there is dirt and light after building your wall you need to plant perennials that will hold the soil in place i suggest that you plan the two sides to compliment eachother since they are so close together groundcover would work but it's boring i would plant perennial flowers which will spread over time don't plant grass it's boring and you have a wonderful opportunity to create two complimentary beautiful mini gardens plus if you plant grass there how are you going to cut it i don't know your zone or how much sun the area gets but i assume it must be partly sunny because i see blooms on the gardenia bush if there's sun you can plant some wonderful clumps of perennial flowers near eachother so that you have continuous bloom through the growing seasons with the retaining wall and mulching the area well there should be little run off after rains the link below classy groundcovers has some perennial flowers that retain soil well not just spreading green groundcovers which as i said before are boring that link is wonderful as you plug in all the conditions of your area including your zone and erosion issues and the site will then offer you plant suggestions that work in your spot which you can then purchase what you like at your local nursery but really any perennial will hold in the soil you don't have to limit yourself to groundcover types tear out that overgrown bush there's nothing beautiful about it and it's too large for the area just tie it up to a truck and drive away the bush will come right out of the ground if you try to trim it back you are probably going to end up with ugly brown branches that have no growth on them and sometimes they never fill back in that area look at flowering perennials at the local nursery that compliment eachother covering the entire blooming season and are varied in color something pink something red something blue and some yellows you get the idea the only things i would keep are the gardenia bush and what looks like some type of leaves from bulbs that is done blooming in the pictures next to that clump plant some flowers that will bloom after those have finished and if they are bulbs you need to plant something that will cover the view of the browning leaves which you shouldn't cut back until they are brown because that is how the bulbs are fed for the next season you could however move those to be positioned better in the garden or divide them into several clumps putting a clump in the neighbor's area too you might also plant another gardenia on your side to compliment the one on their side two mini flowering gardens could be stunning there people will love to gaze at those flowers walking past your house and flowers make people happy don't forget to mulch and mulch deep at least to keep the weeds down and retain the rain instead of it ending up on the sidewalk there will be some erosion run off in the beginning until the plants are established and the soil is compacted after you plant push the soil around the plants down firmly with your shoes it should be a fun project  Drawing CPU cache Casting Solar power Floppy disk Sega Saturn

hard wood installation problem i was watching a friend of mine who was doing hard wood installation for the first time he used hydrolic nailer with a noisy compressor for each plank he was nailing special nails into the groove of the plank but when trying to insert the next raw we noticed small gaps even if you hit them with the hammer the gap want go away the cause was that the nails inside the groove in first row where not fully flushed with the surface by using a big nail and hammer we manually pushed those nails inside the groove after that the gap disapeared and with little effort the second plank was fitting perfectly so where did we do the mistake why the nailer didnt insert the nail deep enough thanks for answers there is a depth adjustment on the air nailer hard to tell you where to look without knowing which model or even a brand of the gun but most have an adjustment usually takes a hex key or torx key to make the adjustment also if the compressor is not producing enough air volume the hose is too small or there is a leak in the air system you can have the same problem  Paint Glaze Manicure Casting Stucco Galvanization Mirror Coat of arms Sandpaper Painting Solar cell Vitreous enamel Tempera Primer (paint) Paper marbling Shroud of Turin Panel painting Light-emitting diode Pottery Heraldry Circuit design Acrylic paint Glass Epoxy Abstraction Deck (ship) Plastic Wok Table tennis Friction Optical coating Wallpaper Superconductivity Caracas Seed Szlachta Lacquer Impressionism Gesso Diving suit Corrosion Printed circuit board Gabriel's Horn Capillary electrophoresis Cosmic Era technology Cosmetics Coat of Arms of Canada Oil painting Photographic paper Ultraviolet 2D computer graphics White phosphorus incendiary Teutonic Knights Capacitor Stealth technology Airsoft Flag of Denmark Anti-reflective coating Brazing Aluminium A Tale of a Tub Art gallery Fashion Pavement (material) Unseen University Molybdenum disulfide Pompeii Flood geology Fluorescent lamp American Paint Horse Papal Tiara Coat of Arms of Slovakia Single bullet theory Cadency Powder metallurgy Fur Bonampak Coat (clothing) Thermal printer Varnish Fruit Art Cave painting Fuel injection Masonry Geology Metal leaf Technicolor Graphics Upholstery SS Morro Castle Lane Extreme Programming Production I.G.

how can you test a basement for mold choose sample point choosing the right spot for mold testing where to collect tape samples of surfaces people collect surface samples for mold testing using clear adhesive tape to identify a visible mold on a surface to screen settled dust for mold allergens or to test the cleanliness of a surface after mold cleanup regardless of the reason the adhesive tape mold test method can be very effective in fact more reliable than spot checks of airborne particles which vary widely minute by minute and far more reliable than culture samples which only grow a small percentage of all possible molds but everything depends on the selection of the sample location where you stick the tape this document explains where and where not to stick the tape when sampling for mold random mold samples tape sampling of arbitrary surfaces or sampling the obvious black mold when investigating a building are practices which increase the risk of a serious error missing what's important and finding what's not very important the result of these errors is the waste of time and money as well as the possible failure to find and address the real problem leaving a health or cost risk in a building to be handled again and again until it's addressed properly mold is everywhere you can't eliminate it if you could we'd all be in trouble as nothing would ever decay and we'd all be so buried in junk and debris that nothing could grow on the earth but we don't much like to see mold indoors and certainly not on our walls ceilings or furniture there we remove it or clean it off this paper describes the detection of mold in buildings by visual inspection of mold suspect surfaces a thorough building investigation for problematic mold needs to address hidden mold reservoirs for which our approach is to complete a detailed inspection and building leak history as well as to record occupant observations and complaints use the links at page left to navigate this document or to go to other resources mold information center mold action guide mold detection how to look for mold choose sample point sampling drywall sampling mistakes use a flashlight attic mold basement mold crawlspace mold mold on dirt floors moldy carpets hidden mold more information what mold looks like stuff that is not mold allergens finding mold test kits home page site map environment mold inspect test accuracy bias pledge contact us sampling drywall gypsum board sheetrock and other building surfaces for mold using clear adhesive tape as i've explained in various articles and at my instructions for collecting and mailing a tape sample to our lab different mold genera species will be found growing on the same or nearby sections of drywall on a building surface depending on several variables if the largest contiguous mold area in a building is trivial in amount say sq ft i would not test it unless i thought that the mold i see is representative of a larger mold problem i cannot see small areas of mold should simply be removed for larger areas of mold certainly if more than sq ft of area is moldy or if mold is growing on many surfaces in a building you are looking for the dominant species present and particularly allergenic or toxic species present in the environment collect one tape sample per location do not use the same tape to sample from multiple locations choose a representative sample spot select a representative spot of mold growth on a surface such as a wall cabinet ceiling or floor this means that if you see what appears to be a single coating of mold suspect growth on a surface all rather consistent by color texture and what it's growing on you need only one sample of that material variations in appearance or texture or growth surface or mold growing in different building areas or floors are reasons to sample more than one thing color sample molds of different colors black white green red gray brown yellow pink are often not always different species texture sample molds of different textures hard lumpy big grainy versus fuzzy and easily blowing into the air are often not always different species growth surface sample molds growing on different building materials this is quite important completely different mold genera and species may be found growing in the same building on different growth substrates drywall room side drywall cavity side plywood sheathing wood stud or joist framing painted surfaces exposed fiberglass insulation kraft paper vapor barrier are often not always different species even on the same growth surface drywall for example different mold species appear at different locations according to variations in moisture level explained just below building area basement crawl space living area and attic all have different moisture conditions often different building materials different patterns of air movement and exposure the green mold found on wood subflooring visible overhead from inspection in the basement is very often a completely different genera and species from the green mold found on the roof sheathing in the attic of the same building representative dust samples we will sometimes screen areas where there is no visible mold by collecting settled dust particles from a horizontal surface if you are going to collect a single dust screening sample collect it either from the area of which you are most suspicious a flooding basement or from the area where building occupants spend the most time perhaps a bedroom or family room variations in moisture gradient in the drywall so if a floor was flooded water loving molds grow closest to the floor such as highly visible black molds like stachybotrys chartarum while molds liking the drywall to be a little less wet grow a little higher such as cladosporium sp cladosporium sphaerospermum cladosporium cladosporioides ulocladium chartarum and molds liking the drywall to be still less wet grow higher still on a vertical wall such as aspergillus sp aspergillus glaucus aspergillus flavus penicillium sp etc therefore where the tape sample is collected can make a big difference in what you find in the first photo of moldy drywall three completely different mold genera and species were within a few inches of one another at different heights on this laundry room wall this condition often occurs but the different genera may be as close as inter mixed and even overlapping in the same area to growing several feet apart on the same wall to growing in the same building but on different materials on different surfaces in this case tape sample the bottom mold was stachybotrys chartarum tape sample the middle mold was cladosporium sphaerospermum and the top tape sample was aspergillus flavus of these three the aspergillus is the easily airborne toxic spore which is more likely to be a problem in the building if it is present in sufficient quantity in this photo detail you'll see that using a new and clean zip lok bag we placed several surface tape samples on the same bag if you can't assure that the bag surface is clean between tape sampling use a new bag for each sample interruptions in the moisture gradient absorption path for example at a wet floor which soaks the bottom of drywall moisture wicks up into the drywall material but moisture wicking may be reduced suddenly at a horizontal drywall joint resulting in easily visible borders or lines in fungal growth exact pathway of water on a surface or in a building cavity so tracing the exact water path through a ceiling or wall cavity is very important are you collecting too many mold test samples there are nearly always multiple mold species present in any environment where mold producing conditions are present we sample surfaces likely to host different molds focusing on surfaces which appear to represent mold or mold suspect material growing over large areas in the building don't collect and send samples if you find you want to collect a great many samples it would probably be smarter and more economical to bring in an expert to survey the building and who can sample more strategically  Drill bit Screw Table saw

want to polish hardwood floor by myself i think that i can do it but how just bought a house made awesome deal but there is only one problem that hardwood floors are in very bad condition i mean it needs polish very badly i don t know how many years ago they polished it last time after paying for down for the house and appliances the budget is very tight so i thought that my husband and me should do it by our self i know we can do it so guys please help give me some links to get info how to do it and need tips from your experience too and for supplies home depot or what what is the best store for supplies thanks a lotttttttt in advance star promise for help but more then that my blessings for you all usually with an old house you need more than polish for the hardwood if you see bare wood sand the old finish go back to all bare wood stain if you want or need to hide problems then varithane for the finish if no bare spots and no discolorations dog or cat mess then you can just light sand and varithane the floors again the details home depot rental centers are a great place to start the regular home depot stores may not have all the best tools for this job so go to the rental center they have a good rental policy all the supplies you pick up in the beginning are returnable if you did not need them so stock up to save useless return trips you should ask yourself if you want to replace baseboard at this point be careful these jobs can multiply baseboard paint window coverings and on and on floors are best done with the baseboard removed if you are not planning on replacement carefully remove the old and save door casing can stay but he base should go you will need a good vacuume to clean the floors of dust you will need dust masks and ear protection the total cost of this job will run plus depending on how many square feet and the extent you are going in order to strip the floor to bare wood rent the drum sander with grit to start sanding old finish off floors is difficult to do the old finish is hard to sand a gums sand paper quickly if you start with the very course grit you will remove the finish quickly be careful if the floor sander sits in one spot for even a few seconds you will dig a hole in your floor the idea with the first sanding is to go over the whole floor once always with the grain and get most of the old finish off then change sandpaper to grit it is much more forgiving and you should be able to remove of the old finish in the areas you can reach again keep the sander moving with the grain of the wood you might want to sand the floor one more time with this sander using the next higher grit paper i think but i usually change sanders at this point you should now turn your attention to the edges i return the drum sander at this point and rent a edger hd charges rent on the tools for as long as you need them if only one person is working only rent one tool at a time the edger is a circular sander and it will get right up to the wall it will sand across the grain of the wood so it leaves more visable scratch marks this is unavoidable but if you follow the directions for the drum sander you will get a good job from it course to get the finish keep it moving change paper is it becomes gummed or worn away as you work your way around the room you will need to change grit and move to a finer and finer grit after each completed trip around the room sand with this toold all the way to grit no other tool will get to the edge of the wall like this one this by the way is the worst part of the whole job it is very hard on your back take lots of breaks it will wear you out if you husband does this job be nice to him massage his back after he's done he will need it i do the edges second because after the drum sander i can see all the parts i missed once done with the edges return this tool one last thing corners even the edging tool has it's limits being a circular sander it will miss the inside corners you will need to do this by hand i use a sharp chisel just remember baseboard will cover most of the corner but you still need it to be flat and even with the surrounding floor or the base will show a gap there if your floors were not too bad of shape and they only need a touch up you could skip the previous two sanders and go right to this one rent a vibrating extra large pad sander wide because of the wide sanding surface it is very difficult to hurt your floor with this one start with grit and sand everything you can reach you wont need to be as careful at going with the grain here the key is to even out the floor fix any mistakes you made with the drum sander continue with this one till you reach the grit paper and your floor looks great on a refinish just lightly sand with and do not try to remove the existing finish follow the directions with any wood stain you might use as well as the directions for the varithane mind the waiting time between stain finish as well as between coats of finish i have mixed feelings about the varithane as you have two choices water or oil based water based finish is easy to apply dries very fast two hours for re coat and is crystal clear in fact i think it dries too quickly it many times does not flatten out well and will leave bubbles and bumps in the finish oil based on the other is slow to dry overnight has an amber color but usually leaves a much nicer finish clean up with oil is also a pain and is concidered a hazordous waste to decide concider the weather fumes time allowed for the project coats of oil means staying off the floor for days then you still don't want to move furniture in for a few more days you will also want to lightly sand the finish between coats to completely strip and refinish allow a weeks work it is a big job but is doable for the average home owner it is also not cheap the rentals and the sandpaper add up quickly however the results are well worth it  Ozone depletion Radar Second language acquisition

best bathroom spackle and primer i am getting ready to paint the bathroom it is an older house without vent fan but nice window to allow for moisture to escape here is the issue the old paint appears to be peeling on at least of the wall surface also the old fish border applied by prior owner that i am removing is soft and peeling like skin it is not dry flaky peel but rather moist sticky peeling underneath appears to be a combination of spackle and this brown sheet rock of sorts anybody know what this brown stuff could be it is very smooth i am looking to find a top quality spackle and primer that is guaranteed to adhere to the surface without this future mass peeling if you will i am willing to spend the extra to make sure i don't have to repaint next year i have spackled in the past only to have paint not really stick well any thoughts would be greatly appreciated after a bit more research and due to the age of the home i am guessing that this is called brown coat the layer of plaster between the first and last coats of plaster it is definitely not drywall and definitely not paper coated anything i am aware of kilz but based on past experience i am not certain that it is the best available and now since i am thinking that this is brown coat do i need a more specialized product to seal it or what also if i decided to tile that area what would be needed over the brown coat i guess these questions would be well directed to a plaster person who has worked with the old lath and plaster applications thanks ah good old horsehair plaster it is a pain in the butt to play with i will run a few suggestions by you to hopefully help you out if you are going to tile over there are a few things you should know putting tile over old plaster is a no no small impacts to old plaster could sent your new tile to the landfill in a hurry the best way to cure that happening is to install a cement backer board they sell this at local building supply stores it gets installed using around inch sheetrock screws the only way to make this stuff look good is to rip it out or cover it up don't think twice about applying a or drywall over the top of the old plaster you will thank yourself for saving the headaches with cracks holes and the whole scraping and scaling paint issue i wouldnt be surprised if it wasn't lead paint seeing its got the old plaster hope this helps if you get more info please contact me i have been playing with stuff like this for about years also kilz sucks i always use zinsser primer it has complete stain control and coat seals about anything  Drywall Masonry Sento Tile Basement Drill bit Dundas Square Wall Wallpaper Gypsum Construction Stan Ridgway Plaster Bridgwater Alhambra (board game) Seismic retrofit Sauna Sears Catalog Home Washroom MS-06 Zaku II USS Wadsworth (DD-516) Mahjong McMansion Changeroom Dymaxion house Carcassonne (board game) Customs and etiquette of Japan Alhambra Bathroom St Albans Cathedral Electrical wiring (UK) Ra (board game) Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad Survivors of the September 11, 2001 attacks Autonomous building Hammam Genericized trademark Hemel Hempstead Wallpaper group Bathing Building material Gay bathhouse Niddah Social rule Orde Charles Wingate Roof Stanford University Home repair Thermae Technicolor Toronto-Dominion Centre Scrabble Fort Dodge, Iowa Sydney Opera House Quarantine Mahjong tiles STS-114 Little Britain Meteor shower Architecture of the California missions Central heating Piccadilly Circus Great Wall of China Urolagnia Hydrotherapy Krzeszowice Japanese toilet Ice hotel Toxic mold Fan service The Apprentice 2 Adi Shankara Woodlands, Singapore Michael Bloomberg St. Petersburg High School Antioch, Pisidia Elfenland Al Green (musician) Manorialism Billboard (advertising) King Khalid International Airport Leicester City Centre PRINCE2 Screwdriver Dim sum Mortar (masonry) Boarding school W.I.T.C.H.

is there a less expensive alternative to tyvek tape we use it to seal insulation into frames but at a roll what makes this tape so special tyvek tape is especially formulated for compatibility with tyvek house wrap let me quote from dupont the final step for maximum reduction of air infiltration through wall systems is to help create a seamless protective envelope sealed with dupont tyvek tape dupont tyvek tape is recommended as a best installation practice for sealing seams of dupont tyvek weatherization system to help provide a continuous barrier against air infiltration dupont tyvek tape is constructed of an oriented polypropylene film coated with a specially formulated permanent acrylic adhesive dupont tyvek tape features and benefits strong high tack easy to use portable impact resistant waterproof conformable adaptable to temperature ranges don't complain about per roll white cap construction supply is asking however if you are using the tape to seal insulation into wall frames and not tyvek house wrap there may be other tapes that would perform just as well you should ensure that the adhesive is durable the adhesive in many duct tapes becomes brittle over time and no longer sticks you may find that the savings using another quality tape will be negligible  Closed-circuit television Surveillance Wal-Mart Television The Inside Xbox 360 Videocassette recorder Digital photography Floppy disk Reservoir Dogs Wi-Fi Camcorder Covert listening device VHS SCART Digital camera Gamut DV 8 mm video format Color System/36 Camera Embedded system RGB color model The Beatles bootlegs Daria Universal Serial Bus Suplex Skateboarding trick Tag Ocean's Twelve Mouse (computing) Saw II Light-emitting diode Radiohead Computer Videotape Amstrad CPC Billiards Apple Computer Stereoscopy The Brady Bunch S-VHS Lee Harvey Oswald Amiga S__CAM Traffic light KaBlam!

repaneling walls ok i live in a trailer and it has this horrible dark wood panneling for walls we are looking to repanel is it something someone can do themselves with out professional help is it relitively easy i've looked on the diy websites and i have been unable to find an articles explaining the process i've lived in mobiles and am in one currently i've remodeled every one i've just re paneled my living room with bead board and i'm pretty satisfied the usual situation is in fact that paneling or even cheap inch drywall is ft wide hence the need for studs to be on or near inch centers the problem might likely arie in that the perimeter of the mobile is paneled or dry walled before interior walls are installed hence occasionally creating a situation where you might have a ft room a inch thick wall and the next stud will be approximately ft into the adjacent room in your case and for ease of achieving what you want i suggest you pull any molding be it cove base or window door trim and check for concave or convex of the current wall material if it all seems flush i'd panel over what you'll lose in floor space will equal less than inch probably will suit your desire for whatever you choose and give you an additional sub surface to tack into i'd also get an air compressor and brad staple gun to do the job narrow crown staples are what was and is used often anyway and they do an adequate job you could if you wish use contactor adhesive such as liquid nails as well as the stapling but it's not strictly neccesary the issues will only be in ripping the paneling at corners perhaps where equal multiples of ft aren't the case and measuring from floor to ceiling as some mobile ceilings are slightly less than the ft length of a piece of paneling if you have a cathedral type ceiling you'll have to adjust for that with waste or purchase extra sheets steven wolf  Hazing Diamond Dude, Where's My Ranch?

if you have some metal or steal and want to make a knife how do you do it put it in detail please well i want to make my own knife and how do i do that put answer in detail if possible you have to anneal the steel soften it by heating it in a specific manner before you can easily shape it you can shape it with a belt sander or with files or with a grinder or by heating it up and forging it after it is roughly the shape you want you have to drill holes for the rivets that hold the handle in place then you have to heat treat the metal to make it tough again this involves heating it up until it is a certain temperature the exact temperature varies with the type of steel then quenching it usually in oil but sometimes in liquid nitrogen to freeze the crystal structure of the metal after heat treatment an edge can be put on the knife and the blade can be polished the handle is attached at this point go to youtube and search for knife making there you will find some video tutorials that will show you these processes in detail i've made several knives and it's a good hobby good luck  Thermostat Autonomous building Carburetor Flush toilet Siphon Water Plumbing fixture Solar power Tap (valve) Sento Vacuum tube Japanese toilet Temperature Sauna Urinal Bathroom Peltier-Seebeck effect Furnace Domestic water system Thermal power station Toilet paper Rebreather Cruising (maritime) Diesel engine Basement Psycho Steam engine HVAC Heat Water (molecule) Process control Swimming Apollo 13 Dialysis Coffee Space shuttle main engine Severe weather terminology (United States) Stirling engine Central heating Toilet Urinary incontinence Turbocharger Climate of the United Kingdom Hyperthermia Diode Ocean thermal energy conversion Bong Renewable energy Spark plug Hot air balloon Warm-blooded Brewery Fire fighting Portable stove Alaskan Bush Welding Jennings Randolph Lake Two-stroke cycle Hard water Hydropower Cold fusion Lake Refrigerator Carbon dioxide Water heater Convection Jet engine Bathing Three Mile Island Thermocouple Fossil fuel power plant Electrophysiology Sewage treatment Greywater Hydroponics Chevrolet Corvair engine Menstrual cup Bunsen burner Energy development Customs and etiquette of Japan Liquid breathing Motor oil Coriolis effect White phosphorus incendiary Samovar Nuclear fusion Spacecraft propulsion Glen Jacobs Diving regulator Diving suit Nuclear meltdown Poker jargon E85 Tea Engine cooling PID controller Social rule Atmospheric circulation Astronomy on Mars

what is the proper way to paint over paneling we are ameratures hi and you'll have to first sand i don't mean a big horrendous sanding job just roughen up the surface to give the paint something to stick to then you'll need a primer which will prepair the surface for the paint it will also aid in getting a uniform color use a water based primer and you can have it tinted the same color as your paint but i never have then you can paint using a water based paint the differences in finishes are sheen durability and scrubbabillity high glosses are normally used in the kitchen because of cooking and allot of use where the walls will get scrubbed and the bathroom because of moisture the only downfall to the high gloss is it shows all the wall imperfections lower sheen paints such as egg shell or satins are used in family rooms living rooms and bedrooms they get scrubbed but not quite as often flats are used on the ceilings and in the garage where of course doesn't get scrubbed hardly ever the only reason someone might use flat to paint a room is because it's cheaper don't do that though you won't be happy with the outcome use high gloss on all frames and baseboards i don't use oil based primer it's a mess to work with dries slow and is extreamly smelly unless you plan to never paint again don't buy or use cheap brushes that will only give you a cheap looking paint job if you have you'll see what i mean use natural bristles for oil synthetic for water base as for rollers the more textured the wall is the fluffier the roller use smooth rollers for smooth walls use roller tray covers than just toss them out when finished i could go into great details on what kind of tools you'll need what brand which paint or primer to use even how and what to clean up with but i won't you need to discover some of those things on your own everyone's likes and dislikes are different igave you the basics so have fun with it bye  Screw Seismic retrofit Wrench Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Kitchen Glossary of firefighting equipment Screw thread Spark plug Plastic Bong Stove Thermal power station Hydraulic machinery Professional wrestling holds Drill bit Carburetor Textile manufacturing Diving regulator Clockwise and counterclockwise Soap bubble Tire Furnace Radio controlled airplane Portable stove Genericized trademark Internal ballistics Violin Professional wrestling throws Wire wrap Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Floyd Rose Two-stroke cycle Hand grenade Dog agility Rebreather Fuse (electrical) Metalworking Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Thermostat Organ (music) Pebble bed reactor Motor oil Hydrogen peroxide Hot air balloon Carbon dioxide Printed circuit board Bolted joint Mars Exploration Rover Fire Solar power Welding Naval mine Snake Mercury 4 Irrigation Steam engine Sling (weapon) Domestic water system Glossary of climbing terms Chevrolet Corvair engine Compiler optimization Siphon Anchor Timeline of invention Rocket fuel Oxyacetylene BS 1363 M16 (rifle) M60 machine gun Universal Serial Bus Cruising (maritime) Apollo 13 Jute Amateur telescope making Shotgun Motorcycle CPU design Novelty (locomotive) Swingout B-47 Stratojet Skateboarding trick Hydrogen economy Saw II Motility Floppy disk Beverage can stove Airbag Casting Gaia Online Snowboard Shaggy dog story Reamer Natural gas

how are cable tv cables grounded i'm in an old house and would like to use the cable outlet as electrical ground my landlord won't allow me to drill a hole in the wall to connect to a grounding rod but the cable box outside is connected to one already is the entire cable grounded and would it be possible to connect an electrical ground somehow i e soldering a wire to the connector shell not at all a good idea coax cable does not have a ground conductor the cable does have a shield which just happens to be grounded to dampen interference the shield is not sufficient to serve as an electrical ground if you do this you run the risk of ruining your tv and any other equipment connected to the coax if you experience a short circuit while connected to the shield the shield will burn out rather quickly if it burns between the connection and the ground rod and it will as this is the most direct path to ground any equipment connected to the coax will receive voltage to the chassis not good if there are others connected to the same cable drop they could be affected as well  Canadian football Great Pyramid of Giza Badminton Great Britain at the 2004 Summer Olympics Permittivity Enceladus (moon) Zambezi Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Women's 800 metres Humpback Whale Hurdling Egyptian pyramids Metre Gatun Dam Cross-country skiing Celes Ch__re Archery at the 1988 Summer Olympics Geography of the United Kingdom Cox Plate Geology of Venus Swimming pool Diamond cut Great Belt Bridge Windsurfing St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne Gaillard Cut Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics Volleyball Colosseum Sequoia Meter (poetry) Grand Union Canal Glider Surtsey Copenhagen Metro Noah's Ark Concerto Avalanche Radio Caroline Basking Shark St. James railway station, Sydney Sniper Francis Petre Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sprint (race) Great Britain at the 2000 Summer Olympics Roller hockey World Wide Web Oslotrikken Ordnance Survey Longwave Fixed-wing aircraft Metropolitan and Metropolitan District Railways Final Fantasy VI Original Sound Version Carolina Kl__ft Light-emitting diode Sperm Whale Laws of cricket British national grid reference system Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Women's 400 metres Krypton Western United States Panama Canal Locks Germany at the 1896 Summer Olympics Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's 400 metres Stealth technology Flood Diamond Young's modulus Balikpapan Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's 110 metres Hurdles Lake Burley Griffin Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's 200 metres Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Women's 200 metres Transmission line Giraffe Canoeing at the 2004 Summer Olympics Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Women's 1,500 metres Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's 4 x 100 metres relay Metric system History of the Panama Canal Bosporus Swimming at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's 200 metre Backstroke Spinosaurus 100 metres Stone ship Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Women's 10,000 metres Pinophyta Eifel Aqueduct Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Women's 100 metres Trampoline Australian megafauna Stockholm Metro Ton Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's 400 metres Hurdles Tyne Bridge Opah Siberia Potential energy Capercaillie Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's 1,500 metres

how hard is it to change an outlet from two prong to three prong assuming i am careful to turn off the power is this the kind of thing i can do without an electrician actually changing the outlet is rather easy make sure the power is off by switching off the appropriate circuit breaker or removing the appropriate fuse remove the old outlet transfer the wires to the new outlet and place it back in the box the bigger problem is making sure you have a proper ground so the new outlet will function properly without a ground the outlet will still supply power and most things will work fine there is a safety hazard however if an appliance requires a grounded outlet there is a reason for the ground and simply changing the outlet does not account for this whether or not you have a ground will depend upon the age of your wiring very old wiring used two wires a hot wire and a neutral with no ground a bit later a ground connection was included but there was no ground on the outlet the metal box housing the outlet was grounded and the frame of the outlet was grounded to the box but there was no connection for the equipment sometimes there was a separate wire for this sometimes it was taken care of with a metal sheath on the cable if you have a physical ground connection to the box you should be able to do this yourself if there is a bare or green wire connected to the box this can be connected to the green screw on the outlet to make a ground if you have metal sheathed cable you can attach a bare wire to the box sometimes there is a screw to attach to inside the box sometimes you will need a grounding clip and attach the bare wire to the ground screw on the outlet for either of these methods you will want to make sure the ground wire is actually connected to a ground with the power on carefully remove the cover from the outlet use an electrical tester the kind with two probes and a light is sufficient to check for voltage between the hot conductor and the metal box hold one probe against the bare part of the black wire and the other against the metal box if you get light there is a ground there if not the ground is not connected if you have a ground you are good to go if you do not have a ground a three prong outlet should not be installed in this location it is a code violation and a safety issue you should call an electrician to upgrade the circuit or install a new grounded circuit  Textile manufacturing Sewing machine Professional wrestling holds Skateboarding trick Sewing HyperText Transfer Protocol Spinning wheel LOOM Textile manufacturing terminology Professional wrestling throws Weaving Suplex Crochet Swingout World Wide Web DragonFly BSD Earring Cotton mill Julia Roberts Wire Wget Lace-making Glossary of partner dance terms Wireless Application Protocol Forth programming language Manual transmission Jon Secada Tai shogi My Little Pony PowerPC RuneScape quests Roxette PHP Figure skating Diving RuneScape cheats English Country Dance Bookbinding Theory of conduct IBM PC compatible Apache HTTP Server Knight Rider Placeholder name Springfield Elementary School Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious Spyware Taikyoku shogi Uniform Resource Locator Remix Aerial (dance move) Dai dai shogi Oral sex Kurt Cobain PostScript Nine Inch Nails Zhao Yun Roy Orbison Maka dai dai shogi Domain Name System Van Halen Rich Mullins Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Pretty Good Privacy Fictitious force Revolver Thread (computer science) Contredanse Proxy server Yoga Sutras of Patanjali JavaServer Pages Firearm action Motorola 68000 Squid cache Billboard (advertising) Fontella Bass Quantum field theory Glossary of firefighting equipment Gmail My Life as a Teenage Robot Hammond organ Gary Rossington Transmission (mechanics) Chu shogi Visual Basic Backward message Scapula Babylon 5 Windows API City Hunter Yarn Federal Standard 1037C MSN Messenger Clockwise and counterclockwise Typewriter Mattress Menstrual cup Hot air balloon Futurama (TV series - season 2) Sacred Harp

bats in my attic hi there i know i bats in my attic and how can i get them out i really don't want them there and they have to go unlike rodents bats do not make nests nor can they gnaw so they do not physically harm your home if they roost in a home long enough however large amounts of guano or urine can build up this can be a nuisance and in the eastern u s where histoplasmosis is commonly found in bird and mammal droppings a health hazard bats are mammals like we are and any poison used on them can affect the occupants of the house additionally bats are so important for controlling insects that it would be a shame to kill off this natural form of pest control rather than killing the bats living in your attic you would be better off to get rid of them by excluding them it is a permanent solution and you won't have bat bodies rotting in your rafters the best way to get rid of bats is also the safest for both the bats and the humans involved this is to exclude them but in this area this must not be done during may june or july because these months are when babies are born and still unable to fly bats that live with us must still go out each night to hunt if they can't get back into your house in the morning they will have to go somewhere else to live follow this link to learn how to do a bat exclusion  HyperText Transfer Protocol World Wide Web Web server Uniform Resource Locator Website HTML Uniform Resource Identifier Web browser Unicode and HTML Internet Eric Cartman Wget Character encodings in HTML Kool Keith Garfield WebDAV Van Houten family Slash (punctuation) Virtual hosting Gopher protocol Representational State Transfer JavaServer Pages World Wide Web Consortium XHTML HTTP cookie Guna Web cache Ecclesiastical Latin HTML element Cross site scripting Yoga Sutras of Patanjali SAML Nirguna Brahman Fire Kool & the Gang Hip hop collaborations Kyle Broflovski Little Big Mom Common Unix Printing System Karytaina Digest access authentication DJ Grandmaster Flash East Coast hip hop Hip hop culture Methana This Boy's Life Ajax (programming) Squid cache History of the Internet The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Everything2 KDE Wiki Mr. and Mrs. Turner ASCII art MIME Kool DJ Herc Gmail Java Servlet Cascading Style Sheets Apache HTTP Server Lefkada Kool G Rap Lotus Notes Wireless Application Protocol Web application Mod python Application server Master of Magic Web page Unix TOC protocol Hip hop music Mozilla Firefox Codename: Kids Next Door Freak Strike Turiya Futurama (TV series - season 1) Opera house Dan the Automator Solar variation Transmission Control Protocol The Simpsons KaBlam!

i would like some painting help the exterior paint of my house is chipping and it is time to have it painted previous professional painters have proven to be quite unreliable so i believe it is time for me to do it myself unfortunately i have no idea how the process should go and i do not have any expert tips on the subject could someone please give me a detailed procedure to follow well painting is all but easy its a time consuming and often misunderstood task st preperation im sure you already heard about how prep is the most important and it holds true but its the most painstaking but more critical task as far as painting goes for the fastest step would be use of powerwasher if used properly this can speed up this task keep a proper distance being to close can gorge your siding and spray downward to avoid unnessesary exposure to water my powerwasher comes with a hose that you can put a bleach solution in be careful obviously that the backspash does not come back and hit you bleach is dangerous wear protective suit apply it by hand or purchase a more environmental safer alternative internet search nd is removing scraping away old paint with putty knife i use a sander to feather the edges alot of paint chips can fall from the ground i suggest protection before your job even starts with the powerwashing rd is deciding how you want to apply your primer paint spraying like powerwashing is the fastest but not necessairly the most applicable way in your case th you now need to primer all exposed areas that are bare wood use a latex primer and spot prime with a paint brush allow to dry about hour then go back over you want to try to bring the primer up level with the existing paint you can primer the whole house especially if changing from darker color to lighter one it doesn't hurt and adds a certain level of added protection its not necessary though but you still need to bring it flush to the paint in those areas th choose a good quality paint and paint one area at time or board in this case start from top to bottom and keep your paint lines wet if allowed to dry it will be noticable keeping this in mind choose your breaks carefully don't paint in the sun plan your time where each side you do will be away from the midday hours th on your trim if your painting a different color let the previous color dry first th scaffolding may help speed the paint along alot more paint can be applied at a time and easier to move  Paint Knife Casting William Powell Piet Mondrian Gas metal arc welding Wood How to prepare an onion cell slide Impressionism Violin Leica Bassoon Galvanization Tempera Ozone layer E.

how do you make an outdoor fish pond from scratch i have never tackled a project like this so i need as many details as you can give me i'm going to put in goldfish just regular commet goldfish i'm willing to do anything for this project and it will be in the shade will it need a filter aeration systems how do i protect it against predators i've heard putting wire mesh over it helps i really want my fish to live a good happy life oh and i need to know how to prevent algae growth it will be in the shade but will that be enough the diy sites can be very confusing i try to simplify first you have to dig a hole to the size of pond you wish to have next remove any rocks that are of any size next you will need to put in sand to cover the bottom and pack it down making sure that no rocks can be felt at this point you can do one of two things either buy a premade liner or use ml plastic purchased at any local hardware store to line the hole i prefer the plastic that way you can make the shape the way you want it next place the plastic in the hole and put in enough water to form the plastic just to where the sand ends next pull the side in a little at a time and fill sand in up the side and fill with more water continue this till you reach the top when you get to the top fold the edge on the ground and place a few rocks or other objects on to weigh it down and mulch pebbles or what ever to dress the edges after this you can put in a filter or a fountain anything that adds air to the water now as far as predator go if your in the country bigger predators will be hard ie raccoons etc but village and city simple screen mesh over the pond just below the water so you can lift up to feed will do  Firearm Internal ballistics Cartridge (firearms) Blood (computer game) Fire extinguisher Transformers: Cybertron Shotgun Thermal power station Shotgun shell V-1 flying bomb Barbecue GunZ The Duel Torpedo Explosive material Campfire Battery (electricity) Fire fighting Diesel engine Shell (projectile) RuneScape quests Lighter Electroshock gun Naval mine Balloon (aircraft) Hand grenade Wal-Mart Fire balloon Plastic Seismic retrofit Glossary of nautical terms Paintball Sponge Spark plug Hydrogen Model aircraft Cannon Reading spark plugs for racing Anti-aircraft warfare M16 (rifle) Minor Harry Potter Beasts Lechaina Escape from New York Iron Piccolo Junior Saga Codename: Kids Next Door Steel Robot Master Mattress Two-stroke cycle John F.

tile backsplash on drywall we are thinking about adding small mosaic or stone tiles on our kitchen backsplash we recently went to a short class at home depot on tiling the guy there reccommended installing a backerboard on drywall first is this difficult for a first time diyer several of the tutorials i've found online install directly onto the drywall any recommendations what are the consequences for installing directly onto the drywall thanks in advance backerboard hardiboard cement board different material same purpose it would be overkill on your project whether you do it is up to you but definitly not necessary its mostly used for extreme wet conditions where water is constant in contact such as shower baths or flooring on drywall install the tile directly on the drywall using thinset mortar premixed is fine to use especially for smaller projects use spacers and a good grout let dry about hours then wipe it down again let it dry for hours then apply sealer on backerboard remember applying backerboard to drywall will extend your wall if you use backerboard plus thinset then tile you bring out the wall of inch of course they make backerboard but still remember you have to cap this somehow to bring the tile back to the wall if you want more flush look you need to remove the area of drywall which you plan on tiling when you do this cut the drywall about smaller on all sides smaller than the area you are tiling cause you have to tape and finish seams between the backerboard joints using fiberglass mesh and mortar screw holes need to be filled as well as far as drywall to backerboard joints easier to do what i said above and keep it flush the only consequeces is that without proper installation it could lead to moisture problems but thats with anything that isnt' properly installed  Scale model Monopoly (game) Venus de Milo M16 (rifle) Domestic water system Louvre Upholstery Slide rule Carburetor Shive USB flash drive Option Fuse (electrical) Breast implant Apple Newton Gasoline Power Mac G4 Cube Chios Fume hood Plastic Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Li Ka Shing O scale De Lorean DMC-12 Inca Kola Diving suit Shoe Trafalgar Square Chevrolet Camaro EMD Winton-engined switchers Paper size Snorkel Screw Pallet Bicycle helmet Motorcycle safety clothing Diving regulator South Pole Insider trading EMD F3 Solar power Say's law Model robot Auto insurance Airsoft Hearing aid Atari 8-bit family Surface-mount technology FN FAL Hydrothermal vent Chevrolet Nova Hydrochloric acid Black-figure pottery Space Shuttle external tank Baby bottle Ford Cortina Dental brace Gameking French art Casting BS 1363 Mississippi Company Audio tape length and thickness Floorball Plastic bag Public transport Rigging Internet fraud Violin Prostitution in Nevada Hubbert peak theory MMORPG GLOCK Sunroof N-Gage Unit Load Device Nuclear reactor Let's Make a Deal Herbie: Fully Loaded G.I.

is it fairly easy to convert sliding glass doors to french doors i have a sliding glass door leading to my deck and would really like to convert it to french doors is this easy and inexpensive other than the cost of the new door if you have ever installed a single door window it's pretty much the same except a bigger hole sliding glass doors are about the same size as a french door units i would take off the inside molding and measure the rough opening the frame construction the door is mounted in and take it to where you plan to buy the new door and they can match up a door for the project after that you may need to shim and level for square and ease of operation but with one other person to help with the lifting not a hard project just to add these doors either or are usually held in with screws on the side under the side usually under a molding not sure how much experience you have before replacing inside molding on the new door be sure to insulate for weather with either a non expandable foam or fiberglass  Drill bit Seismic retrofit Mosaic Masonry Tile Sento Plaster Menstrual cup Kitchen Asbestos Thermal power station Architecture of the California missions Tessellation Basement Upholstery Concrete Casting Japanese toilet Mattress Roof Textile manufacturing Drainage Electrical wiring Toilet paper Spark plug Dam Brewery Domestic water system Wood Antioch, Pisidia Stucco Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Lighting Sauna Urinary incontinence Hard disk Violin Sewage treatment Fiberglass Diving suit Radio controlled airplane Carburetor Hamster Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Oscilloscope Textile manufacturing terminology Glass Dundas Square Home repair St Albans Cathedral Bong M16 (rifle) Equine conformation Gas metal arc welding Perl STS-114 Condom Combine (Half-Life 2) Carpet McMansion Woodworking RISC Tent Toxic mold Gypsum Printed circuit board Water Propeller Wildfire Stan Ridgway Mortar (weapon) London Underground Wallpaper group Fire extinguisher Iowa class battleship Wire Stonehenge Straw-bale construction Taikyoku shogi Artillery Windsurfing Ra (board game) Towel Desert Urinal Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February

what is an economical and effective way to tint candles my secret crayons you just have to work a little harder to dissolve them another effective way is to save pieces of old burned out candles especially if they are very dark in color surprisingly there is often lots of this stuff left when a candle burns itself out just melt the old pieces and add more wax until you get the color or amount you need a great candle can also be made by filling the mold with broken pieces of old burned out candles then you add wax that is uncolored or just very lightly tinted then you have a unique candle that is not only beautiful but also a memory of the significance of the old candles  Concrete Casting Seismic retrofit Basement Mattress Terrazzo Drill bit Woodworking Masonry Passenger car Reinforced concrete Glacier Opportunity rover Poker jargon World Trade Center Portland cement Bathroom Coffee Hoover Dam Tofu Glass Enceladus (moon) Conker's Bad Fur Day Kitchen Grinding machine Light-frame construction Polyurethane Combine (Half-Life 2) Pile Tile Fecal incontinence The Chemical Brothers Plate tectonics Drill Textile manufacturing Shotgun Pottery Asphalt concrete Plastic Prestressed concrete King Khalid International Airport Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Brewery Panama Canal Locks Hogwarts Floor Directory Carburetor Eggerland series Hamster Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Dundas Square Solar cell West Side Highway Suspension bridge Bread Natural building McMansion Le Corbusier Blood Simple Dam Professional wrestling match types Domestic water system Wood Bong Thermal power station Volcano Ceramics Plumbing fixture Gramophone record Sand casting Home improvement Xanadu House Professional wrestling throws Francis Bacon (painter) Strake Motor oil Glossary of firefighting equipment Chromatography Houseplant Norway national football team Rail tracks Washroom Chatsworth House Whitewater Hurricane Rita Corrosion Screw Super Mario 64 Borehole Retaining wall Tea Classics Champagne (beverage) St. James railway station, Sydney Japanese toilet Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur Electrophysiology Babbitt metal Color Petronas Towers Columbine High School massacre

how can i achieve a clear second coat of varethane the first coat looks great but trying to acheive the second coat is a challenge what could cause this make sure you are using a clean brush the suface must be dry and smooth and you want to brush in only one direction with the grain if the surface is not smooth it will cause tiny air bubbles in the next coat wait till it's completely dry and then very lightly sand with grit sand paper use a tach cloth to remove sanding residue and always stir never shake top coats  Durham Animal Crossing Stanley, County Durham Wallpaper group Whitley Bay Super Chief Annfield Plain County Durham Bishop of Durham Tyne and Wear Newcastle United F.C.

help how do i fix a wire that broke off from my outlet my water cooler was putting out room temp water so i put my tester in the outlet and it didn't light up i shut off the power removed the receptacle and about inches of the black wire was just laying there connected only to the outlet i gave a tug at where it broke off and it wouldn't budge so there is no slack to use i know i have to cut into my drywall and the box is broken on the bottom screw hole so i will need to replace it but how do i deal with the problem of not having enough wire could there be more slack outside of my outlet box perhaps if you're cutting into your drywall just remove the existing box and put a new box in inches higher that's if the wire comes in from above either way inches lower if it comes from below then you can joint a piece of romex to the existing wire and run it to the original box location and just put a single gang blank on it to cover it up if you take a hacksaw blade next to the existing box and work at the nails holding it to the stud you should be able to get the box loose wihout cutting drywall if it comes from way up high try to get the staples loose good luck and put a receptacle up high then mount a flat screen panel tv up there to cover it up ideally if you could get to th point of origin from that wire you could remove it all and then re run it but i'm sure that's not really gonna be so great but i think that if you've already decided to cut and patch drwall just put a new one in a little higher or lower however much you need to get the wire in the box and on the receptacle code does say at least inches from the point of enterance good luck to ya  Pottery Casting Sandpaper Brewery Brazing Woodworking Leather Upholstery Drill bit Diving suit Gilding Martini cocktail Manicure Brush Friction Violin Bong Solar cell Knife Dry cleaning Wok Sewage treatment Stucco Hemp Plastic Sea-Monkey Nuclear fallout Carbon dioxide Tofu Wine Glacier Paint Printed circuit board Drawing Collodion process Printmaking Sand casting Shroud of Turin Ice resurfacer Car washing techniques Fire extinguisher Dog E85 Repouss__ and chasing Laser engraving Wine making Tar sands Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Soldering Eraser Bread Cosmic Era technology Typewriter Dairy Ink Sand art and play Synthetic diamond Shotgun Water purification Radio controlled car Towel Building material Gristmill Photography Risotto Flour Wood finishing Crucible Glass Bulk vending Glossary of wildland fire terms Eolian Specular highlight Hamster Motor oil Hay Wood Desert Dog agility Vitreous enamel Compact disc Soap Thermal power station Halitosis Vacuum cleaner Mattress Mahangu Textile manufacturing terminology Amateur telescope making Primer (paint) Ice cream Fecal incontinence Wildfire Radio controlled airplane Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Stalag Luft III Collecting fossils Heinkel He 100 Shampoo

eavestroughs consequences of it extended past fascia board my eavestrough picture http hidebehind com cda a contractor recently installed eavestrough to my entire home but noticed that a number of the troughs are extending past its fascia board extending past the house and into the air is that normal or was he suppose to cut it to match the full length of the board so as to not extend past the house are there consequences of having an extra long eavestrough thanks i kind of disagree that it's a good job but certainly the contractor may have had issues to contend with that dictated his decision it looks as if he gave the gutter a grade which aids in water run off with no pictures of that corner of the house or other adjacent pics of the house and gutter install it's impossible to say why there is no down spout at that corner it's also difficult to determine the material used from the pic it could be aluminum but actually looks like gutters used plus years ago fabricated of wood had i done the job and using every consideration i probably would have at least suggested carrying the gutter around the to the adjacent facia but again it's difficult without a total view to imagine all the conditions to more directly answer the contractors notion might have been to hopefully catch some runoff at that corner by extending the gutter not a choice i would have made but again it's difficult to say without knowing the big picture steven wolf other than aesthetics you should certainly be able to determine any consequences in the next heavy rain fall  Drill bit Screw Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Drywall Poker jargon Tire Mattress Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Barbed wire Fuse (electrical) Distribution board Geodesic dome Loudspeaker Oscilloscope Thermal power station BS 1363 Electrical wiring Punch card Dog agility Ammunition National Electrical Code (US) Springfield 1903 rifle Overhead lines Fan (implement) Carburetor Equine conformation Solar cell Anchor Nine Inch Nails Glossary of climbing terms M60 machine gun Thermostat Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Wire Betting (poker) Naval mine 1957 World Series M16 (rifle) Three-phase electric power Residual-current device Casting Professional wrestling match types Propeller Basement Terminal ballistics Universal Serial Bus Temperature Wood carving Harp Woodworking Amateur telescope making Gramophone record Brewery Transformer Floppy disk Langstroth hive Wire wrap TGV Iowa class battleship Boat building Rail terminology Wood E85 Computer case Machine tapers Eggerland series Motor oil Violin Clinker (boat building) The Star Wars Holiday Special Spark plug Atari 8-bit family Bong Electrical wiring (UK) Dodge Charger Table saw Transistor Saw Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Cable television Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Cray-3 Trapping Headlight Rail tracks Plane (tool) Laptop Bassoon Glossary of firefighting equipment Stairway Plasma display

describing facing directions of a house i need to write down facing directions of my house such as front of the house back of the house etc can someone tell me commonly used terms to describe each side of a house i mean do people describe them using north south east west directions but if they do then is that based on worldly coordinates where north means north of the city or does north mean the front of the house thanks for your help if you look out a window and you're looking north then that's a north facing wall if you look out your front door and you're facing south then that's a south facing home and so on it doesn't matter which is the front or back just the direction it faces  Basket Kitchen Milton H.

how do i remove the ceiling fan i actually want to keep the fan but remove the extension arm and have the fan flush against the ceiling i don't know where to start do i have to shut the power off am i going to electricute myself do the blades have to come off too not all fans can be switched from down rod mount to flush mount look at the top of the fan where the down rod attaches then look at the canopy plate on the ceiling where the rod comes out to go down if there are screw holes in the canopy that will match up with screw holes on the top of the fan then it probably will flush mount if not you can shorten the down rod by replacing buying a shorter rod to take a fan down i always take the blades off if there is no light fixture you might get by with leaving the blades on but if the blades hit on something on the way down the blade bracket is very easily bent they're made of soft metal yes turn the light switch off at the wall go to the ceiling and see how the canopy is attached usually it has screws up close to the ceiling that have to be removed once it is loose it will slide down the drop rod and rest on the top of the fan now you can see how the fan is hung in the bracket attached to the ceiling electrical box you will probably be able to see the wires and wire nuts also making sure the power is off take the wire nuts off and separate the wires the wires from the ceiling should be solid copper and the wires from the fan will be stranded wires put the wire nuts or electrical tape over the bare ends of the black and white ceiling wires and push them back up into the ceiling box that way if anyone comes in and turns on the switch the wires cannot short out your circuit remove the screws holding the fan mounting bracket from the ceiling box the fan will be heavy especially if you didn't take off the blades by the way take off the blades at the motor it's much easier that way use a drill with a phillips bit to remove the blade motor screws once the fan is down then see what you have to do to make the down drop shorter and reverse the process to re install the fan  Glossary of partner dance terms Car body style Skateboarding trick Volleyball Exponentiation Geographic coordinate system Shotgun house Potton British national grid reference system Professional wrestling throws Leicester City Centre Vowel Wilton House Contredanse Bringing It All Back Home National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam Abbey Grand Forks, North Dakota New York City Subway nomenclature Window Vehicular cycling Polarization Anatomical terms of location Architecture of Cambodia Assonet, Massachusetts Cardinal directions Central London Coordinates (mathematics) McMansion Professional wrestling holds Manhattan Hogwarts Floor Directory Vector (spatial) North Magnet Heat St. Stephen's Green Butterfly stroke Sento Battle of Berlin Stairway Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey The Jeffersons (South Park) Grace Cossington Smith Essex County, New Jersey Buckingham Palace Equine conformation Microphone 3D projection Theater terms Egyptian language Angkor Wat U.S. Highway 1 Milwaukee, Wisconsin North America Western Front (World War II) Poker jargon Kedleston Hall Xiangqi The Time Machine The House of the Seven Gables Property tax Maxilla Strap-on dildo Operation Market Garden Korean Demilitarized Zone Chess strategy and tactics U.S. twenty-dollar bill Mongoloid Chatsworth House Dai shogi Bristol Grammar School Monticello Blood Simple Lower Manhattan Suburbs of Johannesburg Israeli settlement Rail terminology Piledriver (professional wrestling) Real estate broker North Wessex Downs AONB Kitchen English Country Dance Four wheel drive Anemometer Judkins shogi Battle of Stones River Glossary of ballet terms Cardston-Taber-Warner Glossary of American football Near North Side, Chicago Third World Transportation in Salt Lake City Anglo-Saxons Rwandese Patriotic Front Canadian House of Commons Charleston (dance move) Wayne Corporation

anyone out there make rag rugs with a frame or without im just starting to use a frame i would like a few pointers thanks to make your loom you need straight boards x 's or something like that cut them so that are feet long and are feet long for a rug about x feet you can reposition one short board to make a smaller rug at another time nail the boards together at the ends then reinforce the corners with corner braces now measure across each board and make a mark at every inch pound small nails on every one of these marks all the way around the boards nail them about deep now gather all of your material to make strips use the same type of fabric in one rug ie cotton polyester wool to make the actual strips cut them straight not on the bias cut them in wide sew the ends together with a bias seam taking a strip fold in of left side in towards center then turn right side under about in and then sew down that seam folding and turning seam as you go along this process covers all the raw edges and your rug will look much better when you have enough strips take them to your loom tie one end to the nail on the top left hand side of the loom then draw it down to the other nail at the bottom left hand side of the loom then pull it around the second nail at the bottom up to the second nail at the top around the third nail at the top down to the third nail at the bottom etc until you have completely covered the entire loom all the way to the right side tie the end on the last nail use a firm type of cloth strip for this it will not be visible when your rug is finished now take the other cloth strips and starting at the top and bottom ends tie one to the left side nail and weave it through to the right side then either loop it around the next nail and continue weaving it back to the left side or tie it off match your strips to the top and bottom of the loom and do the center area last while you are weaving the strips you will need to use an old toothbrush handle to push them down tightly at some point you will experience the joy of artistry and the resultant euphoria as you begin to create a beautiful pattern enjoy the excitement of your creation and when you are finished the rug slip the loops off all the nails sew the loose ends to the rug if you have changed fabric strips at every nail you may need to finish the edges by cutting all ends even and covering them with a narrow cloth border or just sew them down all the way around for a more fringed effect have fun  Kitchen Woodworking Furniture Wood carving Lathe Desk Sears Holdings Corporation Secretary desk The Brady Bunch Saw Drill bit Columbine High School massacre Jigsaw puzzle Plane (tool) Wood router Woodworking machine Shaggy dog story Product Lifecycle Management Abbey Passenger car Wal-Mart Apple Macintosh Computer Table saw Dormitory The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Best Buy Chair Frankfurt kitchen The Inside Chatsworth House Screw Copyleft Library Intellivision Oxford English Dictionary Upholstery Japanese tea ceremony Quality control Refrigerator Portsmouth Block Mills Atari 2600 Surveillance CPU design Station wagon Drill The Apprentice 2 Powel Crosley Jr. AmigaOS Mouse (computing) Wooton desk Floppy disk Dave Matthews Band Extreme Programming Emergency preparedness Computer virus Monticello Chopsticks Amiga Trademark Universal Serial Bus CPU cache Commodity Sears Catalog Home Linux File system Berkshire Hathaway Katamari Damacy Knife Software engineering IBM TARDIS Mattress Microsoft Windows Apple II family Culture of Korea Grandview, U.S.A.

how do you attach facing to a neck edge on a shirt i'm making a pajama shirt and i'm completely confused about how to attach the facing do i baste stitch it and gather it like sleeves and then stitch the directions that came with the pattern confuse me at this point also what is grading the seam allowances this is one of these steps where you should have someone standing by your side but lets see if i can walk you through it what the facing is is the fabric that finishes the edge of your pj neckline you do not want to gather it like a sleeve since the point here is to create a finished edge for the neck have you already attached the front neck facing to the back neck facing yet and edge stitched the outer edges the next step is to pin the facing to the shirt this is done by matching right sides together typically you lay the shirt on the table with the right side facing up then invert the facing with the right side facing down pin the two together matching notches circles center backs and seams stitch along the seam allowance do not gather since this will pucker the neck opening if you are nervous about this use a baste stitch the first time through before you do any clipping let's double check to see if you've sewn the facing on properly merely flip the facing around like you are tucking in a collar the seam you just basted should now be the finished edge of your shirt if everything looks like it's in the right place unflip the facing back into it's original position and this time sew it for real grading the seam allowance means that you don't trim the seams at the same length this prevents having a bulky collection of seams beneath the finished edge of your neck line if you are still confused email me and i'll walk you through it in greater detail  Peanut Peanut butter Adhesive Internal ballistics Peanut butter and jelly sandwich Tanning Butter Popcorn Nut (fruit) Genericized trademark Stuck Together, Torn Apart Breast Tofu Wound Spidey Super Stories Cartridge (firearms) GX-9900 Gundam X Clinker (boat building) Christo and Jeanne-Claude Bubblegum Cuisine of Africa Breastfeeding Dairy Cyanoacrylate George Washington Carver The Inside Supernumerary nipple Yarrow M&M's Saturated fat Nipple piercing Cuisine of the Philippines Breast bondage Solvent Pulse (legume) Chili con carne Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Homer Simpson The Wolf Man Tasmanian Devil Screw Domesticated turkey Pubic hair Toplessness Chocolate Cookie Hamster Alice B.

lighting fixtures and ceiling fan problems my father had hooked up a new light and and a ceiling fan whe the switch was in the off position the lights and fan came on whe placed into the on position the lights went off then the fuse popped there are switches that control both one in kitchen and one in the hall unsure if the circuit they are on can handle the wattage they are producing or if there may be a short in the switch any help would be appreciated when the lights came on and the both switches were in the off positioned it acted as a complete circuit but when the switch was placed in the on position the light went off but at that time it popped the fuse the switches on the control both lights at the same time when both fixtures were lights it worked fine but once one of the light fixtures turned into a fan light combo its not working correctly im thinking either bad switches or the area cant handle the wattage but unsure since the main concern is the lights come on when both switches are in off position it sounds to me like you have three way switches so the normal on and off position does not apply and it sounds like the fan light may have been wired wrong or the circuit is over loaded when the fan comes on  Professional wrestling holds Shirt Professional wrestling throws Aerial (dance move) Bookbinding Mattress Suplex Equine conformation Skirt and dress Sewing Powerbomb Knitting Glossary of nautical terms Fast bowling Professional wrestling attacks Skateboarding trick Swingout Knife Piledriver (professional wrestling) Stairway Glossary of American football Comanche Kilt Glossary of partner dance terms Sewing machine Skinhead Glossary of climbing terms Carpet Floppy disk Japanese tea ceremony Cricket Professional wrestling match types Professional wrestling aerial techniques Strap-on dildo Upholstery Black tie Academic dress of Oxford University Colours, standards and guidons Pattern (sewing) Poker jargon Mandible Violin Lindy Basic Panoramic photography Maxilla Chess terminology Textile manufacturing Contredanse Kurt Angle Salwar kameez Double bass Glossary of graph theory Stocking Dice Rugby union positions Casting Volleyball Mark Calaway Adam Copeland Drill bit Starfleet ranks and insignia Oscilloscope Palatine bone Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Clothing Sailing Coin flipping Computer representation of surfaces Wallpaper group Boy's surface Point groups in three dimensions Scapula Dog agility M1 Helmet Sword making Snooker Fencing Humerus Horse Jack plug Chess strategy and tactics Dog training Gurkha Contingent Shogi Betting (poker) Frontal bone Clothing terminology Rail terminology Autopsy Freehand lace DDT (professional wrestling) Welding Necktie Football (soccer)

how can i prevent my child from burning himself on baseboard heaters we're renting a house and that's what we have for heat there's an inch gap in the front across the whole heater for the hot air to come out of he can easily stick his fingers in there and burn them i'm trying to figure out if there's something i can buy i was thinking of a long baby gate but there's no walls for it to hold on to i would have to run the gate from one side of the room to the other and block off the door it's just not possible any ideas you can't protect them forever if he burns himself he isn't likely to try touching it again just make sure you get onto him for messing with it even when it is not in use that way he is less likely to start playing with it later on if you put somehing in front of it you will be creating a fire hazard you could also purchase some space heaters that won't get hot and will shut of if he knocks them over  Crochet World Wide Web HyperText Transfer Protocol Uniform Resource Locator Lace-making Knitting Textile Textile manufacturing terminology Ajax (programming) Web server Apache HTTP Server Website Tatting Knot Wget Proxy server Textile manufacturing Domain name PHP Representational State Transfer Uniform Resource Identifier Secure Shell Internet Domain Name System Arts and crafts SAML Phishing JavaServer Pages Web crawler CPAN Apache Software Foundation Internet censorship in mainland China BitTorrent Extraterrestrial hypothesis Java Servlet User agent Sewing machine VJ Session Initiation Protocol Common Unix Printing System Python programming language Denial-of-service attack Librarian Transport Layer Security Virtual hosting Wiki Visual Basic .NET WebDAV Squid cache Unix Neopets MIME GNU/Linux naming controversy Cross site scripting XRI Tokelau Ragnarok Online Writers Guild of America Jabber Gaia Online Regular expression Federal Reserve Wikisource JSON Baldness Dynamic-Link Library Caterpillar Yarn MSN Messenger Microsoft .NET Open access UK Underground Microsoft Glossary of American football Mozilla Firefox Electronic commerce Scalable Vector Graphics Delta encoding Sun Microsystems University College London Wendy Orlean Williams Google Web Accelerator HyperCard Footbag Television network Pantyhose Warez University of California, Irvine I2P Preston Capitalism Internet privacy Kaisariani Leiden Opera house Gnutella Port numbers Strategic management Stardock

how do i if at all rig up a window air conditioner to work in an attic recently thought i was a genius and installed a btu amp volt window air conditioner in my new nd story additon with the rear of the unit hanging into the attic all is well and good with the unit when the air temp is moderately high but these past few days with the temp in the attic peaking around degrees have been causing the unit to trip the amp circuit breaker i have an attic ventilation fan that i could use via duct work to blow outside air directly on the back of the ac unit or to suck air directly from the back of the unit i could also increase the ampreage of the circuit breaker but am not sure if gauge wire can handle anything above amps another option would be to run a thicker gauge wire to accomodate a larger circuit breaker but i feel that is not adressing the real problem of the cool air ventilation to the ac unit anyone have any suggestions it sounds to me like your on the right track and all you need to do is exhaust the hot air coming off of the back of the a c unit out of there it is trying to cool the area but also pumping hot air back into the same area off of the back of the a c unit if you could hook your attic vent fan up to the back of the a c unit via duct work of some kind like you said and have it exhaust this hot air outside you will have solved your own problem  HVAC Fire fighting Basement Thermostat Thermal power station Softball STS-114 Firefighter Volleyball Spark plug Glossary of firefighting terms Wood fuel Glossary of American football Furnace Apollo 13 Campfire Door Glossary of firefighting equipment Billboard Hot 100 Torpedo Laws of cricket Sento Mars Exploration Rover RuneScape quests Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Diesel engine Stairway Insulation The Ark in Space Seismic retrofit Hot air balloon Casting Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Salad Fingers Solar power Autonomous building BS 1363 Indianapolis 500 Vacuum Space shuttle main engine Tag Violin EastEnders Chatsworth House Vacuum tube Hard disk B-47 Stratojet The Shining (film) Mario Dualism (philosophy of mind) Natural Selection (computer game) Glossary of wildland fire terms The Empty Child Shaggy dog story Fire extinguisher Chevrolet Corvair Table saw Rose (Doctor Who) Dundas Square Kitchen High-voltage hazards Miss Saigon Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious Pebble bed reactor Friends Rais massacre MAME Milton H.

can i use a power shower pump with a seperate mixer valve i assume you're thinking of installing a water pump to increase the pressure of your shower firstly you can only do this to a gravity fed hot water system not a combi boiler or megaflow second make sure the water tank is big enough it's no use increasing the pressure of the shower if you're going to run out of hot water in two minutes so the pump needs to go somewhere between the hot water tank and the shower ideally as near to the tank as possible in the airing cupboard would be best firmly fixed down maybe to a breezeblock to minimize the noise a twin pump will pump the hot and the cold water so they are at equal pressure which is essential for a thermostatic shower mixer you can use pretty much any shower mixer you like with a pump for most showers a or bar pump is enough for large rain heads or body jets bar or above would be best try to buy a brass pump it will be more expensive but will last a lot longer than a plastic one stuart turner monsoon pumps are excellent  Gramophone record Basement Seismic retrofit Vacuum cleaner McMansion UK Singles Chart Casting Carpet Sydney Opera House Tile USB flash drive Plastic Central bank Linoleum Predatory lending Kitchen Plywood Mattress Movie theater Plasticizer Vinyl roof Christmas tree Arlington House Franklin W.

how to i eliminate ripples in our wall to wall carpet they may occur at the seams you need to have your carpet restretched with a power stretcher by a professional a kicker will not work because with a kicker you are not able to get a stretch on the entire room if you remove the furniture from the rooms should only be a service call of around which is a whole lot cheaper than if you bought a power stretcher and tried it yourself while not ripping the carpet i don't know what area of the country you live in but in areas with climate swings if the carpet is not properly acclimated put in the house hours before installation you will usually need a restretch that's because the latex in the carpet backing has not had time to adjust to the conditions and will be expanding or contracting upon conditions one good restretch will ususally fix the problem  Wallpaper Wallpaper group The Shining (film) Autostereogram Wal-Mart Fecal incontinence Menstrual cup Casting Windows XP Animal Crossing Copy protection Drawing Stucco On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Linked list Wood Toilet paper FoxTrot Mach kernel Japanese toilet Wilton House Redundant array of independent disks Retinal detachment Abstraction Unemployment Spidey Super Stories Hard disk Theory of conduct Typewriter Hamster One-time pad Age of the Earth Ebook Equine conformation Craps Internet protocol suite Social rule Mattress Microsoft Windows Three Stooges Tessellation Airsoft Tattoo Jumpstart 3rd Grade Sun Valles Marineris Let It Be...

how to heat outside pool with wood burning stove hi can anyone give me serious answers to how i can use a garden wood burning stove to heat my ft above ground swimming pool solar not a good option nor is leaving sun to heat as we dont get much in scotland and heaters cost too much in electricity thanks nessie see not so mad after all am i didnt think along lines of water tank more of putting a pipe through the fire to heat up and the filter pump puts back into the pool circulating the hot water but need help to explain on how to diy it you need an answer that comes from experience i was in the same boat and don't listen to any of the hare brained schemes previously written here go buy yourself feet of inch convert to metric copper tubing i got mine at a metal scrap yard and paid by the pound much cheaper than at the store by as much as you think you can cram through the door of your stove without crimping the tubing my stove is about inces deep and inches wide and i used feet of tubing coil and bend the tubing so it forms a coil inside you stove cut a hole in the stove for the inlet and one for the outlet and let the tubing stick out of the stove a little in both places be sure there's still room in the box for burning wood too for the rest of the plumbing you can use pvc or cpvc piping use only cpvc on the outflow since it is made for hot water run a 't' off your filter system output so you're not heating the water before it goes through your filter and your filter still has a place to push the excess filtered water to the pool t line runs to the stove input with a gate valve controlling the flow you need to adjust the flow depending on how hot your fire is if you use the full pressure that the filter creates your pipe will never heat up and you'll shower your firebox with condensation i can heat about gallons per minute flow from farenheit to farenheit connect pipe from your firebox output to the edge of the pool and just let the water flow in it can get hot enough to burn people or melt your liner so use common sense i never operate mine when kids are in the pool or i open up the gate valve a lot so the water can't get too hot i live in south carolina so our winters are pretty mild i find that this stove extends the swimming season months for wimps and creates year round enjoyment for me above ground pools lose heat easily so you might want to invest in a bubble cover too hope this helps and find a friend to help search the web for tips on bending tubing without crimping it also always let your fire go out before turning off the water flow most of all have fun and learn from your mistakes  Poker jargon Universal Serial Bus Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Telephone exchange Ethernet Jack plug IPod Drill bit Optical fiber Knife Coaxial cable Floppy disk Oscilloscope Telephone numbering plan RS-232 Dialysis D-subminiature Modem DVD Phreaking Telephone Electrical wiring (UK) Plame affair 25-pair color code Baseball Atari ST Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Residual-current device Condom Ribbon cable Cable television Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Wire Big Brother (USA TV series) Windows 2000 Wire wrap Internet Registered jack Light-emitting diode SCART Space elevator CPU cache Intravenous therapy The Inside 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Die (manufacturing) Explosive material Lawn mower Textile manufacturing Embedded system Glossary of climbing terms Wheel of Fortune Integrated Services Digital Network Musical Instrument Digital Interface Gas metal arc welding Password Surveillance Screw Snooker Amstrad CPC Action potential Cruising (maritime) Internal ballistics Johnny 5 USB flash drive Rail terminology BS 1363 The Strangerhood Telephone tapping Interstate Highway Electrical wiring Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster The Star Wars Holiday Special The Doctor Dances RCA connector Spyware RuneScape quests World Wide Web Digital Visual Interface Computer bus Switch Transformer ITU-T Digital circuit Spark plug New York City Subway nomenclature Advanced Technology Attachment Glossary of graph theory Heinkel He 112 9-1-1 Phishing

gallon swiming pool help pleaze i have a gallon pool and it is slowly turning green because of algeae what can i put in there to help it that is not clorine i heard of putting i pint of clorox in it its an above ground pool for algae you can use either shock or an algacide or a combination of both the chlorox actually is chlorine in a liquid form but a pint is likely not enough it'll all depend on how bad the algae issue is the idea is to get your chlorine levels up past break point chlorination at least possibly higher if the algae is so bad you can't see the bottom so that you have more good guys chlorine than bad guys algae that's the only way to kill it all if you go the chlorine route you could possibly use a good quality poly quat algacide alone if the algae issue isn't too far advanced forget about using the cheaper algacides they don't work well a poly quat algacide can also work still with elevated chlorine levels whereas the cheaper algacides won't one thing you do need to do is take your water in for a full analysis at a pool shop it's usually free there could be an underlying chemistry problem like a low stabilizer level or total alkalinity out of balance that could have helped cause the algae bloom in the first place  Furnace Brewery Glossary of firefighting equipment Carburetor Bong Fossil fuel power plant Welding Siphon Swimming pool Spark plug Casting Rail terminology Space shuttle main engine Hydraulic machinery Diesel engine Portable stove Plastic Hydrogen economy Vacuum tube Energy development Naval mine Thermostat Stove Flush toilet Transformer Autonomous building Cruising (maritime) Irrigation Dundas Square Glossary of firefighting terms Heat Kitchen Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Fire fighting Internal ballistics Sauna Dairy Basement Mattress Drill bit Solar panel Torpedo William Murdoch HVAC E85 Coffee Scuba set Diode Floppy disk Wood fuel Ocean thermal energy conversion Water purification Diving suit Motor oil Fuel injection Seismic retrofit Refrigerator Soldering Pebble bed reactor Three Mile Island Nuclear reactor Tire Gas metal arc welding STS-87 Boiler Dialysis Apollo Command/Service Module Air conditioning Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Jet engine Oscilloscope Tap (valve) Incandescent light bulb Sento Reef tank Steam locomotive nomenclature Gold standard M16 (rifle) Novelty (locomotive) Nuclear power Home repair Transistor Swimming Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Domestic water system

how can i make a deadbolt mechanism that locks the front door from outside via a key fob remote hello i'm interested in either making or buying a device i can add to the inside of my front door which allows me to deadbolt it when i leave the automated deadbolt mechanism would be activated by a remote control and ideally be dual powered battery adapter plugged into the wall i'm looking for a solution that does as little damage to the door as possible and allows me to keep the existing lock deadbolt basically a remote control deadbolt that can only be unlocked from inside or with the remote thank you david m negative the risk is still the same as when you leave your house and lock the regular door your deadbolt remains unlocked if no one inside is there to lock it this is actually extra security even if someone scanned it they'd still be only to unlock the deadbolt not the regular lock so its still a net loss for said bad guy this is also the case w garage door openers but i don't see insurance companies having anti garage door penalties or saying the house is somehow more vulnerable schlage and kwikset both make residential duty remote deadbolts they are not very expensive and will use the same holes as your existing deadbolt no doubt home depot and lowes sell then or you can order one from a locksmith if you go with a locksmith he should be able to key it alike with your knobset if you like i don't recommend any electronic lock without a key over ride sooner or later a battery will be jarred loose or the remote will get wet or some other unforseeable pitfall will cause a lockout you don't want to rely exclusivly on a cheap remote i've seen too many car alarms that couldn't be disarmed on a rainy day  Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Spark plug Fuse (electrical) Electrical wiring Volt Residual-current device National Electrical Code (US) Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis High-voltage hazards Three-phase electric power Leasehold estate Plasma (physics) X10 (industry standard) Toyota Prius Universal Serial Bus Electricity CompactFlash Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Battery (electricity) Vacuum cleaner Spark gap Distribution board Kitchen Laptop Extension Cord Cruising (maritime) Lighting Nintendo GameCube Electricity meter Battery electric vehicle Alcohol fuel Hybrid vehicle Ground and neutral Mains electricity Electrical engineering Electrical wiring (UK) Circuit breaker Renewable energy Waste (law) Membrane potential Ampere Monopoly (game) Computer bus Circuit design Transformer Glossary of firefighting equipment Thermal power station NEC Corporation Ceramics Fan (implement) Bass guitar Solar power Microcontroller Diesel engine Jack plug Voltage drop Tire Operational amplifier Piezoelectricity Lineman (occupation) Oscilloscope Vacuum tube Resistor Power supply Electricity Supply Board Leasing Power cable Electricity distribution Electrical generator Electricity generation Fossil fuel power plant Strap-on dildo Carburetor Locomotive Carbon nanotube Spacecraft propulsion Incandescent light bulb Digital circuit Eviction Microwave oven Electric potential Japanese toilet Adapter Jon Secada Enigma machine DVD Printed circuit board Copyleft Power line communication Plastic Electrician Electricity pylon Internal combustion engine Breathing gas Electrical resistance Carbon dioxide Energy development Water Casting

is it expensive to fit a toilet and small sink into your house how much roughly does it cost to fit a small sink and loo into a box room upstairs in a house currently the only bathroom is downstairs i have no idea how much it would cost so please give me a rough idea i can buy a cheap loo and sink its more the rough cost of fitting it and plumbing etc that id need to pay out to get it done im located in uk the problem is in the waste connections you need to make a drain connection to the waste pipe and need to make a vent pipe from that connection go up through the roof that waste is the biggest and most costly effort connecting hot and cold water is not as complex especially if the new one is located directly above the old one the fixtures themselves are often loss leaders at building supply places so you can get them cheaply the room itself can be very simple to build and could be decorated easily at low cost since it will be small  Do it yourself DIY ethic Hammer Olduwan Hammer and sickle Valve Hammer Editor Tool Super Mario Bros. 3 Diablo II Changing Rooms (TV show) Drill Forge Collecting fossils Axe Chisel Upholstery West Coast hip hop Piano Kenny Everett Rockhounding Stone tool Programming tool Jackhammer DIY audio Anvil Marble sculpture Home repair Repouss__ and chasing Ice axe Thor (Stargate) Metalworking Strategic management Thor (Marvel Comics) I, the Jury DIY Culture James Nasmyth Anarcho-punk RuneScape quests Death rock fashion Mjolnir (The Matrix) Reengineering Chuck (engineering) Hammered dulcimer Lithic flake Anstey, Leicestershire Glossary of climbing terms Game port Supercomputer Blacksmith Jan Hammer Koopa Troopa Usability MC Hammer Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's Hammer Throw Steel John Kennedy Toole Anarchist symbolism Drill bit Operation Flashpoint Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Women's Hammer Throw Lithic reduction Queer as Folk (UK) Mallet Sword making Drill bit shank Death rock Woodworking Machining Enfield revolver Home improvement Punk rock Bray Productions Moon rocks .44 Magnum Richard Roberts Guild Wars Mike Hammer Mercenary Armand Hammer Grommet Marking out Beta Ray Bill Paper Mario Stone carving USS Trathen (DD-530) Casting Technology Mario W.

what are the steps to stripping and re painting a wooden bench seat we want to repaint it white or black is one of those easier than the other how do we make it look professional should we paint spraypaint glossy matte does it need to be coated with something after the paint dries it will be indoors do we need to sand it first i think right now it is just has a varnish on it if it's just varnish i wouldnt bother to strip it just sand it a bit grit or so should do apply a coat of primer and then paint either color will require about as much work as the other just keep in mind you can get primer in white or darker colors too so match the primer with the finish coat spray painting puts on a very thin coat so it will probably take more coats than if you brushed it on but the advantage is that you get a smoother finish after all is said and done sand very lightly between coats to scuff the surface so the next layer of paint will adhere steel wool works well for this if you want to eliminate the wood grain altogether then use a 'filler' before priming have fun  Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Fire extinguisher Olympic Flame Scramjet Swamp cooler Portable stove IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth Gas tungsten arc welding Filling station Reaction control system Tier One Air pollution Gas metal arc welding Hell's Kitchen Plasma arc welding Turbojet Kitchener, Ontario Inkjet printer Jet engine Atlas Comics (1950s) Plasma cutting Solid rocket Urban beach Kitchen Spacecraft propulsion Abiogenic petroleum origin Flue gas desulfurization Akatsuki (Naruto) Human Torch Turbofan Fire breathing Chef Space shuttle main engine Marvel Universe Fountain Epcot 2003 North America blackout Marvels Rydia Fuel injection Torch Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem Human Torch (Golden Age) Syringe Expanding nozzle Port Authority Trans-Hudson Air safety Operation Torch World War Three (Doctor Who) Aviation fuel Turbine Afterburner (engine) Diesel engine Aerial refueling Carrie Jacobs-Bond Rocket fuel Stove Recycling Splash pad Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Knight Lore Olympic Games Battle of the Bulge 10 Rillington Place Zippo Steam turbine Diving regulator PepsiCo, Inc.

how much tar is in camel lights i'm trying to convince my boyfriend the tar and nicotine in a light cigarette is the same as in a regular camel if you look at the filter you will see a series of holes that are poked in in a very specific pattern those holes are designed to take in clean air thru the filter so that when a test is ran on the random cigarette by a testing lab it will pull in more air and less of the bad stuff and the secret is that the testing companies use a device similar to a straw on the end of the filter for the test but those little holes are placed in the filter in just the right place by the company so that when you are smoking a light cigarette you have your fingers covering those holes and well imagine that you got all the tar and nicotine you would have gotten from the regular version anyway if you look at the filter of a light cigarette versus the filter of a regular one after they are smoked you might notice that the light one has a bit more clean spaces around the outer edge thats from not getting all the holes covered every time you inhale but non the less you still got what the tobacco company is counting on your temporary dose of poisons that are in every lit cigarette now that i finished this little novelette i think i will go out on the patio and fire up my cigarette and no its not a light  Paint Woodworking Varnish Pottery Casting Primer (paint) Brazing Wood finishing Brush Glaze Wood Lacquer Drill bit Handloading Knife Upholstery Sandpaper Internal ballistics Brewery Tempera Mattress Epoxy Amateur telescope making Friction Plastic Violin Manicure Painter and decorator Table tennis Stucco Hand grenade Painting Aluminium Textile manufacturing Impressionism Titanium Masonry Wok Polyurethane Nunchaku Gesso Galvanization Hamster Christmas tree Cartridge (firearms) Wood carving Printed circuit board Gas metal arc welding Volleyball Photographic film Light-emitting diode Airsoft Powder metallurgy Bassoon Leather Technicolor Carpet Drawing Transformer Solar cell Diamond enhancement Polymerase chain reaction Gilding Architecture of the California missions Fire extinguisher Boat building Glass Fluoride therapy Dinghy Fire fighting Pavement (material) Sand casting Textile manufacturing terminology Lead paint Wassily Kandinsky Repouss__ and chasing Cosmic Era technology Billiards Corrosion Watercolor painting Arcade cabinet Explosive material Surrealist techniques Collecting fossils Color Professional wrestling match types Trail blazing Seismic retrofit Paper marbling Piet Mondrian Air pollution Panel painting Welding Clinker (boat building) Cigar Tin Compact disc Jan van Goyen Acrylic paint

how do you whitewash a hardwood floor i am a year experienced painter we have whitewashed pickled many cabinets ash panelling and floors actually instead of buying prepackaged pickling you can make your own simply take a latex paint of the color you want mix it with water walla you have it apply areas the whole length or width of the floor depending on which way the flooring runs you can apply with a paint roller then let set for about minutes then take clean rags wipe over the surface with the grain remove as much as you want some prfer to leave a white film all over the entire surface and some like it wiped down to where it is just in the grain let dry over night apply one coat of polyurethane let dry sand it with grit sand paper just buff lightly to remove the raised grain vacuum then apply another coat of polyurethane etc you can do this also with oil based paint but the drying time odor and clean up is terrible alot here get confused when some people say whitewash for in the old days we mixed lime and water together to whitewash or paint exterior beams wood etc now days the term whitewash relates to staining wood etc or also calleed pickling you can also delute your paint of choice if you want it deeper colored practice on some scrap wood of the same flooring you are usuing here is a link also http alsnetbiz com homeimprovement pickling html  Tobacco Bong Cigarette Smoking pipe Hookah Tobacco smoking Nicotine Cocaine Camel (cigarette) Hard disk Tobacco advertising Cannabis (drug) Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Air pollution Kryptonite Hand grenade Bob and George Poison Textile manufacturing Nicotine gum Cigar Snus Smoking ban Cigarette Smoking Man M16 (rifle) Kitchen Lighter Movie projector Late Night with Conan O'Brien Ultraviolet Floppy disk Places in the Wheel of Time series Carburetor Professional wrestling throws Screw Syphon Filter Kretek Asbestos Dairy Drill bit Smoke detector Perl Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Firefighter Imperial Tobacco Computer virus Brewery Pneumonia Chewing gum Condom Glossary of nautical terms Messerschmitt Bf 109 Asthma Stage lighting Jet engine Health issues and the effects of cannabis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Magic (illusion) Polarization Sin City Hashish Causality Tobacco industry Hardware random number generator Cyanide Mattress Glossary of firefighting equipment Compact disc Traffic light Professional wrestling holds Drug test Marlboro (cigarette) Arguments for and against drug prohibition Radiation hardening Items in the Metroid series Nuclear fallout Door Dioxin Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Unix Gas mask Surveillance Mojave people Digital photography Sento Vacuum cleaner Spliff Illegal drug trade Textile manufacturing terminology Modem Courtyard Marine aquarium Motor oil Hamster Laramie Cigarettes StarCraft: Uprising Pinball

how do you make a portable stage out of wood i was wondering how i could make a portable stage ft x ft that could support around people at a time it needs to be easy to transport and get out of the way meaning it can't be too heavy but the platform needs to be made out of wood preferably the simplest thing to do is build it in smaller sections that go together either that or build it onto a trailer for more details feel free to contact me at tootall yahoo com we could possibly figure out a way to make it fold out from a smaller size it will be a bit heavy if only wood is used the pros use extruded aluminum this is nice but ups the price and the skills needed to work with it  Vinegar Diseases of the honeybee Bedbug Drag racing Ed, Edd n Eddy Pesticide Bulk vending Poker jargon Coca-Cola Phoebe Buffay's songs Happy Tree Friends Hamburger The Marshall Mathers LP Insecticide Ant Menstrual cup Cuisine of Denmark Gypsy moth Hunter __ Hunter Reservoir Dogs Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Advertising World War Three (Doctor Who) Charles Goodyear George Costanza Barbecue Pittsburgh English Duran Duran Shaggy dog story Carnivorous plant Insect Vernon Schillinger Sodium hydroxide American Black Bear Knight Rider SimAnt The Human Stain Breakfast Toyota Prius Cheese Mayonnaise Vacuum cleaner Apple Ketchup EastEnders Tire Bread Ant colony optimization Betting (poker) Pickling Terror of the Autons Food preservation New Zealand English Biological pest control Plastic Toilet humour My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Spider DDT Restaurant Citric acid Hamster Japanese toilet Minor characters in Morrowind I, the Jury Diner Chile pepper Sex Pistols Fish and chips Acetic acid Shen Gong Wu Apache Ant Unfaithful (film) Dim sum Good Times Kill Bill Draw poker True Crime: Streets of LA Pesticide toxicity to bees Invader Zim Ramen SMTV Live Toffee Sushi Jackass: The Movie Denji Sentai Mega Ranger Dodge Charger Tooth Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Sea-Monkey Gary Numan Treehouse of Horror XI Isle of Wight Soldering TGV Organic farming Garfield Dairy

how do i fix a very large hole in my ceiling o k so i'm renting an older house turned into an apartment building and a friend of mine went into the attic and fell through the ceiling after we told him not to he's going to help us pay for a fix it but we're not sure how to go about doing it the hole is probably ft long and ft wide and it looks like its drywall i thought maybe get a large peice of drywall cut it nail it to the beams in the attic and then blend it into the rest of the ceiling with some kind of putty its a drywall ceiling with no texture i've been reading about having to get mesh tape and boards with holes in it frankly i'm confused with so much information out there is anyone who has done this before and had it be a success or any best way of doing it my landlord does know about this which is the least of her problems because we're willing to fix it she's got other tenants who broke a toilet fixture and then left letting it leak all over the floor and warp it so she's pretty pleased we're nice enough to fix it haha you already have the basics you state in your q large suggests spanning beams rafters with a piece of drywall at the thickness probably inch making sure that the cut back area is at least centered on the beam even if you remove screwes to replace them the beam is approx inches allowing you inche for supporting the existing remaining adjacent ceiling as well as the patch that may mean cutting away even more than the damaged area and certainly to square up the patch in any case the cuts you make on the patch will not all be at the depressed side sides or the drywall but can be if you enlarge the damaged hole a sheet of drywall is ft wide most usually that would allow that only cut ends would be flush with the existing ceiling mesh tape is best and is usually modestly adhesive don't nail use drywall screws mud is best done in no less than steps as it shrinks in drying think of it this way even if it takes more time with regard to mud in this case less is more even the best can't expect a flush non sandable surface in one swipe hot mud is a technique you should probably not even investigate obviously adding tape and mud will require sanding an eventual repainting the issue with regard to invisible is so often an illusion in that when you mud then sand you're feathering the patch to make it appear in a decent job that it too is flush and vanishes to accomplish that as a diy you can use ceiling paint lightly rolled over your best patch efforts to judge any rise or depression etc i want to assume you're honesty in alerting the landlord but i'm not the ooops police steven wolf thousands of sq ft of drywall hundreds of gallons of mud and paint  Knife Sharpening stone Woodworking Drill bit Mug Sword making Tea Bowie knife Japanese kitchen knives Ceramics World Wide Web Japanese tea ceremony HyperText Transfer Protocol Pottery Essential oil Bong Pencil sharpener Chisel Blade Stone tool Mango Web server Ski Hong Kong-style milk tea Glass Drink HTML Amateur telescope making Mattress Klingon Hiberno-English The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Breakfast Uniform Resource Locator Coffee Cannabis (drug) Cuisine of Singapore Yerba mate Unicode and HTML Crayola Razor Pocket knife Damascus steel Spear Stockade Greasy spoon Alcoholic beverage Turquoise Katana Kukri Textile manufacturing Casting Linear Pottery culture Lightning rod Conker's Bad Fur Day Herbal tea Burns supper Survival skills Drinking culture Yohoho!

do you like organizing all your paper work how do u do it my desk is a disaster plz someone teach me plz specify if you are a businessman or student i am a student and my desk is full of paper i wanted to throw all of them away of course i cant but i seriously think of using dynamite sigh how should i organize it plz help next semester is going to start very soon awww there will be more paper p s i have folders and binders they wont help maybe i am not using it in the right way every piece of advise that i read to your answers are great and i've found in my organizing practice that it may not work for you you have to find your own answers but that doesn't mean you need to do it all your self you have to do what's gonna work for you other people have things that work for them but they could be a completely different person and it may not work for you there is no one organizing box that everyone fits into know that so i don't know you major so i'm making this up obviously if you are a science major you don't need to keep the art history notes after you've finished the semester start by purging stuff from previous classes that are unrelated to your major or that you don't think you will need to reference again as much as i hated accounting i kept the book because it's good to reference and i have used it one of the keys is to know what you will you and what you won't and doing a purge at the end beginning of every semester wait until grades are published things that you think you will need for reference once you get out into your field but maybe you have finished the classes on it can be packed away and well labeled so that they don't take up valuable space that can be a premium when in a dorm room or sharing and apartment as many of us do when we're in college ask youself if you need it ask yourself where you would look for it then get into the habit of taking the time to put it there just remember the more we put off the more we're going to have to do later so take the minute or two as someone else mentioned to put it away whe your done with it another couple for tips if your teachers don't test cumulatively then file away notes after the test so they will all be in one spot for the midterm or final keep the current material with you so you can reference it if a teacher mentions clean off you desk at the end of your day or study time make a note about what needs to be done when you come back to it this will help you feel better about getting started and also help you organize your thoughts as well i used to use spiral notebooks that had pocketed dividers that way i could keep the inportant stuff all in one place and reference it when i'm in class it's was a great place to keep my class syllabus if the teacher mentioned that he had to miss a class it's also a great way to keep the information together i would never tear out my notes so they were always together in chronological order and always focus on how you want it to be not on how bad it is if you focus on the positive then your more likely to create that hope this helped  Seismic retrofit Drywall Casting Screw Tire Wood Textile manufacturing Gramophone record Knife Lighting San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Stairway Asbestos Architecture of the California missions Violin Atari 8-bit family Mattress Woodworking Wood carving Punch card Black hole Nine Inch Nails Leasehold estate Floppy disk Super Mario 64 Straw-bale construction Upholstery Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Clinker (boat building) Poker jargon Textile manufacturing terminology Spidey Super Stories Naruto jutsu Carburetor Solar cell Patch (computing) Welding Anchor Volleyball Flush toilet McMansion Computer representation of surfaces Opportunity rover Electrophysiology Guns N' Roses USS Tunny (SS-282) Genericized trademark Second Battle of the Atlantic View camera Rigging Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Combine (Half-Life 2) Plaster Friends The Legend of Zelda series enemies Dairy Oscilloscope IRT Flushing Line Redundant array of independent disks Keynesian economics Dodge Charger Lathe Transformers: Cybertron Plastic Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Dice New York City Subway Deck (ship) Carbon dioxide GunZ The Duel Fire fighting Wire Urinary incontinence Ocean's Twelve Action potential Pottery Coffee Hard disk Stage lighting Stave church Stud poker Scientology beliefs and practices Tobacco Doom engine Faster-than-light Baroque chess Carpet Metroid Prime 2: Echoes Pretty Good Privacy

how do i fix a worn magnetic strip on a credit card the magnetic strip on my most often used credit card wears out quickly i am in europe right now and getting a replacement card from the us takes time is there a quick and simple way to fix the magnetic strip i have seen cashiers wrap thin plastic around the card and swipe it that way which has led me to believe that applying a strip of scotch tape should do the same thing or is there a better solution short of getting a new card i worked as a cashier for about years we weren't allowed to accept strange looking credit cards putting tape on it would not have been accepted by our store the plastic bag works when it wants to pretty much you have to call the company of the card but you should get a small envelope for credit cards they usually lose their ability to work cause they rub against other cards or things in your wallet putting it in a small envelope that is made for them is the best bet it's only regular paper you could make one yourself sometimes the banks have them but you have to ask for them  Knife Violin Label Screw Snooker Seismic retrofit Drill bit Billiards Timpani Bulldozer NWo Manicure RuneScape quests Scrapbooking Nail (anatomy) Upholstery Car handling Tire Fencing Aerial (dance move) Fast bowling Pottery Textile manufacturing Suture Bulk vending Table tennis 2000 Australian Grand Prix Toilet paper Helicopter Genericized trademark Saw Batting (cricket) Double bass GunBound Terminal ballistics Powerbomb Woodworking The Inside Gramophone record Duct tape Chopsticks Bowie knife Sailing Razor Professional wrestling holds Printed circuit board Chess strategy and tactics Katana Mail Professional wrestling throws The Shining (film) Fan (implement) Volleyball Postage stamp Scissors Shogi Shroud of Turin Textile manufacturing terminology Wind turbine Electrophysiology Autogyro Postage stamp separation Boat building Punch card Kenny McCormick Softball Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Reversi Coin flipping In-N-Out Burger Shaving Cello Drag racing Mattress Professional wrestling attacks Knitting Guitar Paper size Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Champagne (beverage) AC/DC OV-10 Bronco Epoxy Domain Name System Kylie Minogue Sword making Harp Magical objects in Harry Potter Intelligent design Glossary of climbing terms Timeline of alternative rock Friction Glossary of American football Movie projector Tenshinhan Radio controlled airplane Casting

replacing rotten subfloor under toilet how thick is the floor typically it was built in ' in new england i'm tackling this project myself 'cause i haven't got the to pay somebody to do it for me i already pulled the toilet up and most of the vinyl it's probably about cu ft of the floor that's water damaged there are drip marks in the kitchen below it but you can't see through i read in another forum that the floor is probably thick but that doesn't sound right to me the suggestion was to use a circular saw and take off a bit at a time all the rotten stuff to the nearest joist i understand the bit about checking the floor joists for damage and sistering joists as necessary i'm more concerned with ripping the wet stuff up any suggestions all i own is a jig saw so i'll probably rent or buy a circular saw i'm more concerned with the thickness of the sub floor 'cause i don't want to cut too deep also how far apart are the joists supposed to be floor joists are typically on center plywood sub flooring is typically you need a circular saw for the job you can buy one at any home center for around if a blade comes with the saw the blade that comes with the saw should be good enough for this job if no blade comes with the saw buy a carbide tipped combination blade ordinarily to cut plywood you would use a fine tooth plywood blade but that is not the blade to use here you will also need a tool called a cat's paw and a hammer the cat's paw is a tool for pulling nails the guy at lowes or home depot will know exactly what you're talking about pull up the vinyl and find where the plywood is nailed to a joist pull the nails out of the plywood using the cat's paw and hammer mark a line along the nail holes go and find the next row of nails and do the same thing mark a line at a degree angle past the edge of the damaged plywood make sure your cross cut is in good wood you probably will not be able to remove the toilet flange so you will have to use your jig saw to cut as close to it as you can and break the plywood away from it now you will need pieces of x or x that are about long measure the distance between the joists you want to toe nail nail at an angle one piece between the joists at the end of your cut out flush with the top of the joist make sure it is slightly under the original plywood as this will support the joint where the old plywood and new plywood meet do the same thing at the other end take the other two pieces and nail them in on both sides of the sewer pipe under the toilet flange cut out your new piece of plywood and you will have to measure from the end of the cut out to the center of the sewer pipe hole and cut the new piece in two at that point mark the hole for the pipe and cut it out with your jig saw slide one piece under the flange and let it drop into place do the same with the other piece and then use drywall screws to secure them to the joists and screw the flange to the new wood you are using screws so that you do not knock the cieling loose under it by hammering nails as a matter of fact you should use drywall screws to attach the support pieces as well that should have you fixed  Refrigerator Manual transmission Brewery William Perry (football player) Bubble Bobble Dodge Charger Ford Thunderbird Mitsubishi 3000GT Dairy GunBound Aerial (dance move) Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway American lobster Dodge Neon Kitchen Revolver Battle of Perryville Hybrid Synergy Drive Filter (mathematics) Tofu Drill bit Poker jargon Ammonia Sonic the Hedgehog Torque Boolean prime ideal theorem Filter feeder Rum P-38 Lightning Toyota Prius Volkswagen Golf Bloom filter Air conditioning Atomic Kitten Precession Refrigeration Anchor Nintendo GameCube Refrigerator car Ford Torino Nissan Skyline De Lorean DMC-12 The Midnight Sun Volkswagen Jetta Textile manufacturing Dialysis Chess strategy and tactics Pinball Mouse (computing) Knife Super Bowl XX Floppy disk Gag (BDSM) Harp Volkswagen Type 2 (T3) Bottom (television) Spidey Super Stories Ford Mustang Ford Taurus Carburetor Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution Low-pass filter Extreme Programming Piccolo Junior Saga Johnny 5 Nintendo 64 In-N-Out Burger Renault 25 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Daimler Club (weapon) Front wheel drive Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina BMW New Class Lewis Mumford Bong Chevrolet Camaro Alf Stewart EMD F7 White noise Adhesive Plough Happy Tree Friends Gas absorption refrigerator DirectShow Fordson tractor Effects unit Barbecue Diesel engine Rent (musical) Springfield 1903 rifle Bulk vending Leica Traffic light Synthesizer Hard disk Electric motor Wario

we are pretty sure we are going to put laminate tile in our bathrooms however my wife has some reservations the reason we are not going to go with regular tile is time we have a year old and a newborn at home so i don't know when i am going to find the time to do it so i don't have a problem with the laminate tile however my wife is concerned about water we have had water damage under laminate in the past and it buckles but that isn't our concern in a bathroom i don't know how water would get underneath her concern is abotu water from the bathtub and shower what happens to that water that gets on top of the tile does it eventually soak down under and cause problems or is their a sealant i can put down to make sure this can't happen i know this stuff is waterproof but i want to cover all basis thanks your wife's concerns are valid and right on target and are the reason i don't recommend laminate in a full bath there really isn't a way to seal the laminate seams and topical moisture will penetrate and cause the boards to either cup or buckle laminate is not waterproof you can lightly mop it but it cannot handle excessive moisture not only that laminate is a floating floor when you reset your toilet and bolt it to the floor the floor is no longer floating properly because it's bolted down in that area this can make the floor buckle as well i would recommend either sheet vinyl or solid vinyl tiles both have come a long way in styling since they first cam out if you use the solid vinyl tiles i would recommend the ones without the peel and stick back moisture will eventually make those come off the floor  Seismic retrofit Drywall Timber framing Drill bit Masonry Light-frame construction Poker jargon Wall Screw McMansion Insulation Alhambra Platform framing Iranian architecture Stucco Stairway Architecture of the California missions Straw-bale construction Capernaum Kitchen Christiansborg Palace Stud poker Le Corbusier Toronto-Dominion Centre Seven-card stud Siding Sicilian Baroque Radiometric dating Tudorbethan architecture Passenger car Wrigley Field Adobe Door Badshahi Masjid Wood Age of the Earth Arlington House Wall Street Belair Stud Vault Draw (poker) Maya civilization Assonet, Massachusetts Natural building Furnace Kremlin towers Five-card stud Moorgate Capitoline Museums and Piazza del Campidoglio Mission Revival Style architecture Irish Houses of Parliament Wood County, Ohio Social rule Sundial Amalienborg Palace Rococo Angkor Wat Sears Catalog Home Plame affair Texas hold 'em Hoo Peninsula Domus Aurea Navigation Baby Blues Royal Mile Sod Tire Mouse (computing) Stanford University Community card poker The Shining (film) The Wall Great Brickhill Mac OS X Witch-hunt Finders Keepers Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace Earring Rathfarnham White House Diamond simulant 10 Things I Hate About You Pevensey Computer virus Casting Violin Rail transport modelling Passive solar Rigging Massachusetts State House Richard Cassels Braeswood Place Collision detection Lighting Avionics Stave church Portsmouth Block Mills Warren Buffett Miyamoto Musashi Stan Ridgway

assimilating laminate flooring i bought traffic master laminate flooring at the big orange box yesterday thursday today is the one day for a while that i will have the time to install it it says to let it sit in the room for hours now i understand that is the best thing to do i'm just curious if anybody has installed it within hours of bringing it home and if so what were the results i assumed it had no wood product in it when i bought it so there wouldn't be any shrinkage or expansion but i guess the fiberboard material inside will adjust a bit if i do this what kind of problem could i expect to see and if there was wouldn't it be somewhat easy to fix given it's not glued or nailed the area is a small hallway about sq ft it is a very humid area it is currently sitting in there stacked up any response is greatly appreciated thanks first i'm going to suggest that you not install traffic master flooring as it's a very poor product line i think there's still a pergo there on special that i can't stress strongly enough would be a better choice for little money more assimilation whether it's flooring or cabinetry is important especially in high humidity environments hours is the stated time on the box but after with this product you're likely safe just be sure to allow the floor to float by that meaning do not install any planks tight to a wall i hold all the way around the room or corridors sides i would go ahead and install just wait the remaining prescribed hours to install your baseboards best regards mike lonergan tradesprofessional inc http www tradesprofessional com  Sento Wallpaper group Wok Scrubs Car washing techniques Dry cleaning Tile Manicure Japanese tea ceremony Japanese toilet Carpet Tessellation Kitchen Soap Cast iron Brewery The Legend of Zelda series enemies Bong Paint The Brady Bunch Laundry detergent Sterilization (microbiology) The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Queensbridge Hogwarts Floor Directory Brush Richard Chase Dundas Square Tattoo Upholstery Menstrual cup Car wash Laundry Wassily Kandinsky Comanche Fecal incontinence Vinegar Dialysis Color theory Seismic retrofit Plastic Tai shogi Codename: Kids Next Door Vacuum cleaner Chatsworth House Mattress Toilet Toilet paper Jackass: The Movie Columbine High School massacre Basement Dishwasher Five-second rule McMansion Lionel Corporation Jumpstart 3rd Grade Mouth ulcer Bathroom Teen Girl Squad Pai Gow The Legend of Zelda series races Taikyoku shogi Scrabble Time Out of Mind King Khalid International Airport Iron Chef National Statuary Hall Eight ball Dymaxion house World War Three (Doctor Who) Titanium 742 Evergreen Terrace Textile manufacturing Caving Soldering Ra (board game) Bread Color Computer animation Opportunity rover PC Engine Gram staining Mission San Juan Capistrano The Human Stain Yellow Hydrogen peroxide Violin Vitreous enamel Fluorescent lamp First aid Diseases of the honeybee Procter & Gamble Asbestos Billiards Grand Central Terminal Architecture of the California missions Nintendo Entertainment System Discworld gods

how do you kill spiders that seem to be living in one particular room of a house i used the bug spray thing where you spray the room close the door and leave for about hours but now its been weeks and there back anyone i kill them everytime i see them but there inside my computer on my bed on the ceiling on the walls its really frusterating your best bet is to spray insecticide around the exits of your home all window and outer doors as soon as it wears off insects will find their way back so it must be reapplied periodically to keep them away spider traps can be placed by the baseboards in the vicinity of doors that open to the outside to catch the ones that make it inside if the task of exterminating is too much think about the fact that you are never more than ft away from a spider anyway so just relax  Typeface PostScript Apple typography Portable Document Format Unicode Dot matrix printer Notepad TrueType Windows 3.x TeX HTML element Screenplay Mimeograph machine Adobe Type Manager EIA-708 OpenType Killian documents Ligature (typography) Cascading Style Sheets Typewriter Atari 8-bit family Ebook Text editor Arabic alphabet Punch card ASCII art Printer Control Language Floppy disk OpenOffice.org Windows XP Quotation mark METAFONT Display PostScript Adobe Systems 2D computer graphics Topology Kerning Paper size Greek alphabet Adobe Illustrator Hangul Graphical Environment Manager Web design OS/2 TRS-80 Punctuation Verdana Printed circuit board System 7 (Macintosh) Speech balloon Pixel Roman numerals Control character Common Unix Printing System LaserWriter Free software Unicode fonts Serif Screen-printing P__li Emphasis (typography) Text figures Markup language QuickDraw GX Susan Kare Compact disc Dash Raster graphics The National ALGOL 68 Windows Vista Adrian Frutiger StarOffice AmigaOS Word processor Keyboard layout Heraldry John Day (printer) Laser engraving Character (computing) Mac OS X Braille Logo File Allocation Table Planet Bravo (software) Han unification Euro Digital photography Windows 2000 Glagolitic alphabet Stellar evolution Minesweeper (computer game) System/36 OpenDocument Newline Slashed zero Library (computer science) WYSIWYG Tab

i splashed muratic acid on my stainless steel fridge is there anything that will clean off the pitting sorry but no pitting is a chemical reaction that can not be reversed you can try to lightly work rub gently in the direction of the finish the area with a very very fine steel wool you do run a risk of making the area worse it depends on how deep the pitting is and how hard you work the area with the steel wool you could hire a welder who does s s work they are familiar with grinding out metals a custom fabricator for restaurants would know of a person again it really depends on how deep the pitting is and if they can grind to a new surface if it was my fridge i do not think i would try it maybe on a hidden spot first  Table tennis Death metal Bulldozer Sonar Jethro Tull (band) Helicopter The Velvet Underground Noise music Golf club (equipment) Blade USS Sea Devil (SS-400) Art rock John Cage Naval mine Grunge music Blonde on Blonde Thief (computer game) M1 Garand Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) The Jam Wipeout (game) Goo Goo Dolls Knife Frogman Combine (Half-Life 2) Led Zeppelin Springfield 1903 rifle Propeller USS Thornback (SS-418) Metallica AC/DC Razor Pantera Thrash metal Zhao Yun GWAR Gothic metal Judas Priest Def Leppard Bolt Thrower (band) Fan (implement) Power metal Pinoy rock Turbofan Supersonic transport Scarification Rock (music) Bohemian Rhapsody Blacksmith USS Tunny (SS-282) Blade Runner Guns N' Roses Heavy metal music In The Groove (game) Punk rock Weapons of Star Trek Black Sabbath Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Woodworking Chisel Bad Brains Pulp (band) Iron Maiden Nu metal Tom Clancy Megadeth Karsten Solheim Pearl Jam Sepultura Trademark Lightsaber Folk metal Tank Stryper Mortal Kombat II British hip hop Alternative hip hop Foreign branding Dystopia (computer game) Nirvana (band) Gramophone record Grindcore Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope Music genre Red Hot Chili Peppers Girls Aloud Korn Land mine Emo Bon Jovi Europe (band) Van Halen Bass guitar You Really Got Me Football firm Twisted Sister Uriah Heep (band) Pat Boone Dental click Sonic Youth

how do i get a broken bathtub drain out the x shaped thing at the bottom broke off so i can't use a drain wrench because there's nothing for it to grab the best way to this is a little tricky you will need a reciprocating saw sawzall with a metal cutting blade cut notches in the metal ring all the way around i would say notches about an inch apart be very careful as to only cut the metal and not the tub that's the tricky part once you have notches in the ring then take a flat head screwdriver and pry underneath it to pop up the ring when you do this though you will have to replace the tub drain which requires you to cut a hole in the wall behind the drain otherwise you will just have to live with the drain being broken with the piece that you say is broken the x you should be safe against leaks but you just will have to get a rubber stopper that fits inside the drain if you want to fill the tub good luck  Knitting Sewing machine Sewing Textile manufacturing terminology Clothing Kimono Climbing equipment Screw Upholstery Suture Mattress Applique Yarn Textile manufacturing Glossary of climbing terms Tattoo Tire Cross-stitch Undergarment Embroidery Elastic Wood First aid kit Shoe Shroud of Turin Characters in the Smurfs Tie-dye Comanche Punk fashion Windows XP Bookbinding Wound Han Chinese clothing Textile Stocking Tzitzit Sari Dialysis Fencing Kitab al-I'tibar Community emergency response team Dental brace Cloth RuneScape quests Tensile strength Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Leather Isaac Singer Flag Kilt PlayStation 2 Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Death rock fashion Atari 8-bit family Berlin wool work Autopsy Duct tape Silk Cochineal Threshing machine Hair coloring Compact disc Drill bit Strap-on dildo Rip Torn Garrett A.

why does water bubble up from my shower drain if water bubbles up from the shower drain without using the shower then you have a main line stoppage it may be a partial stoppage but i'm willing to bet that it bubbles up when you flush the toilet you'll need a plumber to come out and clean out your line he will either need to pull up the toilet and run his snake through the pipe for the toilet unless you have a cleanout outside somewhere a cleanout is for the purpose of cleaning out your main sewer if you have a cleanout then it will be cheaper than pulling a toilet some plumbers go up on the roof and run their snake through the vent pipe some homeowners try to rent a snake and do this themselves but i dont recommend that due to the fact that if you dont know what youre doing that the machine can hurt you bad hope this helps and goodl luck  Hydrogen economy Petroleum Alcohol fuel Natural gas Propane Nuclear power Portable stove Biodiesel Monopoly Autonomous building Microeconomics Gasoline Explosive material Natural monopoly Gross domestic product Fuel injection Sewage treatment Town gas Energy development Renewable energy Future energy development Alternative fuel Filling station Hybrid vehicle Wal-Mart Gas turbine Nuclear power phase-out Turbocharger __lectricit__ de France Transformer Internal combustion engine Airsoft Diesel engine Fusion power Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Carburetor Enron Corporation Gas metal arc welding Gas turbine-electric locomotive Fuel cell Solar cell Coal Alkane Electricity meter Automobile Toyota Prius Pebble bed reactor Tax Law of value Free trade Liquified petroleum gas Central processing unit Price discrimination Wind turbine Life insurance Annuity Economics Implications of peak oil Publicly funded medicine Energy Policy Act of 2005 Tariff Welding Hubbert peak theory Privatization Wood fuel Jet engine Economy of Russia Wankel engine 1973 oil crisis Tesco FairTax Internal ballistics Broadband Internet access Single-stage to orbit Rebreather Rational pricing Paintball Helium Power station Digital photography Cruising (maritime) Uranium Porsche 911 Inkjet printer Dairy Fire fighting Hydrogen

does anyone know how to effectively level the ground before laying an above ground swimming pool i have read several different idea in which none worked your hekp would be appreciated contrary to what many people may say do not spread sand on the ground to level it the sand will act like tiny ball bearings and let the pool slide down hill always dig out the higher ground to match the lowest grade level within the area of the pool once the ground is level then you may need to spread and tamp debris free masonry sand to a depth of inches to provide a cushion under the pool bottom digging the ground yourself can be a real chore if the ground is hard packed clay or rocky and you have to remove several inches if that's the case then either rent a transit and a bobcat or hire an excavator to dig and grade it level if you choose to dig and level it by hand then start by getting a straight board when laid edgewise ideally as long as the radius of your pool assuming it is a round pool to simplify this discussion you will also need a good accurate bubble level at least feet long you can also use a laser level with stakes and string but it may be more tedious if you are not skilled at using it determine the location for the pool trying to find as level an area as possible mark off the area for the pool and dig out the sod for at least a foot beyond the edge of the pool starting at the lowest point inside the pool area dig out the dirt from the higher area using the level to make sure you don't dig out too much once you have dug out about half the width of the pool you should attach the level to the edge of the straight board with tape have a helper hold one end of the board on the ground at the lowest point where you started digging from you can then move the other end of the board around the area where you are digging and see if you have dug out enough dirt to level the area with what was the lowest spot once you get that half of the pool area leveled then have your assistant hold the end of the board at the center of the pool area you should then move around the pool area with the other end of the straight board on the ground and dig out the high areas to level the ground along the length of the board ultimately you should be able to slide the board on the ground with one end at the pool center all the way around the pool area with the bubble level staying level when you can do that then the ground is level and ready for your pool once the pool is level the pool you may be able to spread and tamp sand to about inch depth to pad and protect the bottom of the pool from roots small rocks and such  Upholstery Textile manufacturing Mattress Professional wrestling match types Sea-Monkey Japanese tea ceremony Floppy disk Changeroom Drawing Loudspeaker Kimono Great Teacher Onizuka Sento My Little Pony Colours, standards and guidons Atari 8-bit family Oscilloscope Textile manufacturing terminology Guitar Pennsylvania Railroad Undergarment Carpet RISC Hamster Garfield Wheel of Fortune Care Bears Dog agility Horse tack Mars Exploration Rover Squidward Tentacles Manifold Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Harp Electric motor Pysanka Francis Bacon (painter) Rigging Violin Scale model B-47 Stratojet Zoids Tire CPU cache Dragon Booster Kylie Minogue Ron and Fez Autostereogram Brassiere Casting Dinghy Traditional animation Bish__jo game Bicycle frame Circuit design Movie projector Fluorescent lamp Teen Girl Squad Dollar store Murdock-Portal Elementary School Wood carving James Kochalka Fischer Random Chess Tattoo Typewriter Poker jargon Door Equine conformation The Contender (television series) Cork City F.C.

a question about bricks i want to buy himley crown buff code on jewsons brick library http www jewson co uk en templates bri how much per brick are they about i know they are all different but a guideline please we are building a large raised bed in the garden and are hoping these bricks are appropriate for the job has anyone any thoughts on these bricks through experience etc i also want a pale mortar to 'match' a nearby wall what should i ask for thank you in advance hi anoni a very nice brick and ideal for what you have in mind jewsons will be very expensive for purchasing these bricks unless you have a trade account or trade with them on a regular basis they will give you minimal or no discount your best price will probably be from a small independent builders merchant for the mortar if you use yellow sand and mix it at a ratio of parts sand to of portland cement this will give a pretty good colour match for these bricks you can mix a small trial batch of mortar and let it dry to see that the final colour is to your liking remember the more cement you use the darker the mortar will be if you require a tinted mortar then you will need to purchase the required 'dye' again from the merchants again it's a good idea to mix a sample batch and let it dry to ensure you get the colour you require it is important to ensure all batches of mortar that you mix are to the same ratios otherwise you will end up with various coloured joints some lighter than others the cost of this brick will depend on where you are located if it is a brick that is used a lot in your area for other work and is therefore readily available then it will be cheaper than if they are not if 'not' they will have to be purchased through a merchant directly from ibstock the manufacturer and i am told the minimum amount would have to be a pallet quantity approximately where i live this is not a commonly used brick and ibstock would require minimum for delivery to a local supplier you may need to allow also for a suitable coping stone to 'top off' the bricks  The Brady Bunch Sea star Rubber duck Rubber Wallpaper group Flotsam and jetsam Peanut Donald Duck Color theory Barium Microsoft Paint Pok__mon Snap Blue Man Group Color Glass James McNeill Whistler SpongeBob SquarePants Blue Piet Mondrian VeggieTales One Piece Paint Colours, standards and guidons The Warriors Casting Brett Whiteley The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Mario Kart 64 BNSF Railway Wassily Kandinsky Koopa Troopa Georges-Pierre Seurat Patrick Star Rubber stamp Zinc Chromium Sesame Street Sea urchin Koopa Kid Pigment Eye color Light-emitting diode Crayola Gamut New York City Subway nomenclature The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap Paul Is Dead Japanese toilet Bathroom Palazzo Pitti Antimony Crown-of-Thorns starfish Camouflage Bernard Palissy Mary Cassatt Ultramarine Yellow Dice Rainbow Islands Plastic Pointillism Starfish Prime Green Queensbridge Common bean Scrubs Nintendo 64 Fairy Tux Paint Harrow School Color blindness Mario Friends British Rail Class 50 The Land Before Time Union Pacific Railroad Seijuu Sentai Gingaman Kingdom Come (comic) Namir Deiter Pysanka Bloody Stupid Johnson Henri Cartier-Bresson Fist of the North Star Oxygen Firework Chlorine Vishnu Toilet humour Impressionism Octopus Handspring Ammolite Animal White House Mercury (element) Pac-Man Soane Museum Air pollution Athens Bikini Bottom

i have an idea for an invention how would i go about making it real i just want it for my personal use i want a large dog to make me feel a little more protected when i'm home alone but i'm allergic so i want to make an invention to help me out when the doorbell rings or someone comes to the door i want to have a recording of a large dog barking loudly what material would i need to do this i don't care about price i'm guessing i'd need a motion detector maybe wow uh no i don't want to make money off of it i want to use it for personal protection this is old school' all you need to do is decide how you'll store your recording on computer aduo disk etc wire that to the motion sensor or pressure sensor so it turns the device on i may consider running my line from the motion sensor to a solenoid the sensor will only give an output if motion is detected this output can activate the solenoid the solenoid can complete the connections for my disk player mp ect now if you really want to get fancy you could use three sets of speakers on your downstairs for example one on the furthest point from the door the next midway and the last right behind the door now make the sound begin from the furthest point and approach the listener to create the illusion of a dog running toward the door i'll leave that project to you its not as hard as it sounds if you're into electronics like you should be if you're considering this project to begin with you would do wise looking at some circuits currently used in similar devices remember too use can use an opamp instead of the solenoid i described i'm old school so this is my way of doing business have fun with it  Burglar alarm Diamond Door Fire alarm control panel Berkshire Hathaway Digital photography Sears Holdings Corporation Retailer Upholstery Illegal drug trade Price discrimination Mutual fund Wal-Mart European Installation Bus Bond Rational pricing Sam Walton Federal Reserve Citigroup Floppy disk Stock Glossary of firefighting equipment Council house Pricing Closed-end fund Tax Arbitrage pricing theory Microeconomics Capital asset pricing model Traffic light Finance Commodore 64 Hard disk Glossary of firefighting terms FairTax MTR Combine (Half-Life 2) Black-Scholes McDonnell Douglas DC-10 Modern portfolio theory Monetary policy Auto insurance Forward contract X10 (industry standard) Domotics Filling station The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Big-box store Smoke detector Inferno (Doctor Who) Washroom Ice core Arbitrage Futures contract Mercedes-Benz A-Class Timeline of computing 1990-forward Eircom Japan-United States relations Enron Corporation Apollo 11 Tesco Electricity market Pizza delivery Video game crash of 1983 Kirby Corporation Grey market Sport utility vehicle Toronto-Dominion Bank Toyota Prius Southwest Airlines Anemometer Federal Standard 1037C E85 SS Morro Castle Diamond clarity Option Telecom New Zealand Day trading Steam (content delivery) Google Technical analysis Knight Rider INSTEON Kazaa Central bank Real estate broker Port Authority Trans-Hudson Market Sales promotion Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Infrared homing Dodge Charger Security guard Al Gore controversies Wayne Corporation Pixel Sobeys

what is the most efficient option for attic ventilation i have a 's cape cod style home the attic crawl space just has small vents on the house under either side of the peak they're small louvered vents that blend in with the siding don't know what they're actually called the upstairs holds a tremendous amount of heat so we're hoping more ventilation could help initially we were going to put in a ridge vent but the roof has a center beam so it's not a viable option the eaves do not overhang so that also is not an option what are your suggestions we had that same problem and had those fans installed on the roof i think they are called roof turbine fans we had two installed because we have a sq ft house it has helped enormously buy them at lowes or home dept ask for someone who can install them if you know a good carpenter he can do it  Electronic commerce HyperText Transfer Protocol World Wide Web Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Web server Ajax (programming) Domain name ASP.NET Customs and etiquette of Japan Application service provider Website Proxy server Microsoft .NET Uniform Resource Locator Phoebe Halliwell Failure rate Top-bar hive Edmund Curll Biz Markie Sento Windows Server 2003 Domain Name System Internet Hot tub Jam (TV series) Motor oil Retailer Piccolo Junior Saga The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Upholstery Harry Clarke Gmail HTTP cookie Shopping Tony Bennett Laundry Internet protocol suite Sobeys Have I Got News For You Narcotics Anonymous Wget Extraterrestrial hypothesis PHP Dishwasher GameFAQs Denial-of-service attack Pharmacopoeia Common Unix Printing System The Source by Circuit City Vendor Managed Inventory Alternative DNS root Radeon The Inside Squid cache Inventory IGA (supermarkets) Teletubbies Web application Internet Information Services Mydoom Kuzari Bong Wal-Mart Representational State Transfer Chinatowns in North America Water (molecule) SAML Session Initiation Protocol Phishing Pet Shop Boys Mahoraba American Psycho LiveJournal Economy of the United States Paul Ehrlich Domain name registry Chemical shift Dishwashing The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Textile manufacturing The Magic School Bus Sergio Leone Web hosting Baseball Dry cleaning Macbeth Yu-Gi-Oh! main characters 1957 World Series Schindler's List Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Kodocha Coin magic Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Shake It Off Nintendo Entertainment System FoxTrot Jabber Product (business) Kazaa

what are the ways in which electrical fires start my neighbor tells me not to perform wiring projects but i was told that wiring is not dangerous if you read up on your stuff it is my understanding that wiring projects only start when you do one of the following cut corners by installing a higher amp breaker than permitted for a given guage of wire to allow too much current to flow through a narrow cable without the breaker tripping when a wire is nicked and then makes contact with another conductor causing a short circuit but even then i believed that shorts of this variety were rendered harmless because such problems are precisely what causes a breaker to trip and turn off the power what other ways do electrical fires start thanks btb is right it's not short circuits those just blow the fuse or breaker but loose connections the wire has to be stripped correctly so it does not have any nicks in it the screws have to be tightened enough and the wires need to be routed so vibration does not loosen them over time it's the loose wires faulty outlets that have been overloaded or have loose wires inside the box that heat up and cause a fire that is why aluminum wire is no longer used in house wiring it cold flows and gets loose heats up and often cracks where it was striped those nice easy backwire outlets switches are a prime example just strip of insulation off and press into the rear of the outlet switch against a spring a few overloads or just metal fatigue will result in a loose connection loose connetctions and heat will buildup even at less than say amps if it's enough to make toast it will toast you before the breaker blows  Fire fighting Paint Milton H.

i just bought a ' palm harbor double wide mobile home this mobile home is in very good condition and i will be moving it to a acre track that i own i would like some advice about setup and whether or not it would be a good idea to make a few changes to the interior i'm going to put the home on concrete runners and from what i understand the home will be approximately to inches off the ground after it is put into place my question is why does it need to be so high off the ground i would like it to look as much like a site built home as possible just my preference can i set the home lower than inches i own the home outright if i do set it up lower than the usual inches will that prevent me from selling later comments please another thing is it doesn't have tape and texture on the inside i am thinking about adding drywalls to the living room and master bedroom is this a good idea would i need to take the paneling off or just put it over it how costly would this be if i did it myself together its about sqft removing the axles and affixing the manufactured home to a permanent foundation such as concrete runners will help in the resale value of your home and help future buyers obtain financing easier financial institutions are more willing to do a loan on a mobile home permanently affixed also all manufactured homes are required to have tie downs they will put metal tie downs in your cement runners before the cement dries and then use cable to more firmly affix the home to the concrete pad it's more stable in storms and another reason the banks like this type of set up to your question about to it is required to have a minimum of clearance you can't put the mobile home directly on the ground because the moisture will eat up the underbelly and start to corrode your plywood floor also plumbing problems septic or electrical problems can occur over time you need for a person to be able to get underneath the home to fix things it would definitely limit the number of people who would be attracted to your home should you decide to resell beauty and practicality will matter to buyers also has one of the answerers already mentioned there are so many great options out there for skirting which really adds a look of stability to the home be glad you will have to to show this off if that does not appeal to you installers offer backfilling this is where they push direct up the skirting and gradually slope it down creating an impression the home is flush with the ground but here is a website for the skirting which looks like stone www stonecote com even if this provider is not in your area it is available nationwide just ask a local manufactured home dealer what company they use to install the new homes they sell pretend you are interested in buying one once you get the name go to that company and get a bid for them to do the skirting or to obtain it they know where to get it i heard tape and texture is needed to help avoid hairline cracks sounds great you own your home outright congratulations on that accomplishment  Floppy disk Seismic retrofit Kitchen Stairway Dundas Square Mantelpiece Drill bit Mattress Magical objects in Harry Potter Wood RuneScape quests Gramophone record Tudorbethan architecture Wilton House Ringo Starr Fireplace Equine conformation Forge Strap-on dildo Brick Wood carving Computer CPU cache Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Mountain bike Mazda Miata Resident Evil (video game) Santa Claus Textile manufacturing Surveillance Chimney Queen Anne Style architecture Light-frame construction 64-bit Punt (boat) Nippur Illegal drug trade Wood fuel Colours, standards and guidons Saw Winchester Mystery House Winslow Hall Toyota Camry Solomon's Temple Odyssey Linux Ford Crown Victoria Mouse (computing) Manifold CP/M Hamster Tire Gideon Mantell RISC Lepenski Vir IPod Unemployment Skateboard Windows Vista Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an New York Giants De Lorean DMC-12 Perl Imperial (automobile) UFO conspiracy theory St Pancras railway station Tribes 2 Sailing Architecture of the California missions Laws of cricket LaTeX Bass guitar Tank Chair Peterhouse, Cambridge Yaodong Table saw Panzer II Sega Saturn Opportunity rover Endgame Rathfarnham Stave church Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Effects unit Red Line (MBTA) Rapid transit Table tennis RuneScape cheats Comics Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Mazda 323 Theory of conduct PIC microcontroller Buick Regal Virginia State Capitol Adobe Panzer I

pulling up parquet flooring to lay tile this is the most horrible job ever surely anyone who ever had to pull this junk up would never ever put it in a house again anyway my question is after you grt it up the floor is torn to shreds from the parquet sticking to the plywood and taking layers of it up with it what is the next step do you just lay the tile board right on top of this bumpy plywood or do you need to pour leveler over the entire floor anyone that's ever been here done that please help by torn to shreds i mean there are two areas where the top layer is peeled away about an th of an inch deep the areas are about inches wide by inches long there are smaller areas of top layers peeling back all over we're still not finished removing it so i don't know how the rest of ot will go you do not want to use a pour leveler it may crack in years to come and cause problems get a floor sander and sand the floor with a rough sand paper grid then do the backer board remember the most important part of the installing is the floor prep  Upholstery Wood Woodworking Baseball bat Chair Staining (biology) Wood finishing Bassoon Leather Glass Violin Fancy rat Pottery Horse Mattress Drill bit Explosive material Melanin Billiards Cello Shroud of Turin Tofu Stained glass Casting Water purification Bong Tooth enamel Wood carving Laser engraving Agarose gel electrophoresis Poodle Drawing Gypsy moth Laser hair removal Suplex Color theory Golf club (equipment) Textile manufacturing Hair color Opportunity rover Fire extinguisher Laundry detergent Bedbug Paint Western blot Plastic Sand casting Malignant melanoma Dye Shaving Primer (paint) Gunsmith Visual cortex Lumber Carpenter bee Frans Hals Architecture of the California missions Saxophone Lathe Diamond enhancement Assonet, Massachusetts The Human Stain Hamster Wassily Kandinsky Olive Varnish Black (people) Knife Table saw Dairy Manicure Professional wrestling throws Uranium Birthmark Scotch whisky Eye color Soap Tanning Tom-tom drum Mushroom hunting Digital circuit Beer English longbow Carpet Gram staining Campfire Beagle Pyramus and Thisbe Crayola Impact crater Blackjack Timpani Bonsai Eolian Brush Osmium Ultraviolet Hair coloring Macbeth Shoe polish

tub lip and stud gap i've just removed the old wall around my tub and it was screwed on resilient channels which were screwed across the studs probably to offset the gap between the studs and the tub lip which is more than i'm replacing the walls with cement board can i just screw it on the channels too the instructions said to screw every around all edges should i add more channels every thanks i'm not sure what you mean by resilient channels perhaps you mean furring strips which are thin strips of wood that are nailed on top of the studs to space the wall out over the bathtub lip they could also be run perpendicular to the studs but that doesn't provide as much support the cement board instructions ask for screws at every along the edges to minimize the movement in relation to an adjacent piece of cement board it's hard to put in a screw between studs when there is nothing to screw into for that reason you might want to put the furring strips perpendicular to the studs and place them on center however i think that a sheet of exterior grade plywood cdx at least thick might be a better choice that way you are assured of having something for every screw to bite into make sure you have a waterproof membrane between the furring strips or plywood and the cement board this could be pound roofing felt or it could be a heavy plastic sheet i would not use tyvek the membrane should overlap the bathtub lip  Seismic retrofit Hoover Dam Antioch, Pisidia Basement World Trade Center San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Air-raid shelter Tunnel Deep Impact (space mission) Great Pyramid of Giza History of the Panama Canal Gatun Dam Temple Mount Decompression sickness Rathfarnham Biblical archaeology Dam Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Drill bit Pile Rapid transit Opportunity rover Aztalan State Park, Wisconsin Gaillard Cut Cathedral of Magdeburg Hoosac Tunnel Stonehenge Big Dig Philosophy of space and time Excavator Ringfort John Hancock Tower National Certificate of Educational Achievement Oak Island Volleyball Archaeological field survey Masonry Archaeology Water well Jericho Hadrian's Wall Tractor Mattress Exeter Bush v.

i have white kitchen cabinets and want to make them look antique is there a stain that does this i saw some at lowes that were almost like an ivory color but looked antique do you use a stain or paint if so how do you do it thanks actually a glaze is easier and faster and cheaper than either painting or staining you can even save more by making your own take water latex or acrylic paint in either burnt umber or burnt sienna and floetrol mix well and you have glaze test on the inside of a cupboard to get the look you want but most of the time i just use a soft rag hubby's t shirts work well for this and use that to apply the glaze work in areas that would naturally show wear and antiquing like in crevaces and edges start out with a light hand because you can always add more to build intensity if you want the cabinets to be easier to clean wipe away grease etc finish with a coat of non yellowing uvb uva protecting polyurethane like varathane  Upholstery Woodworking Wood Drill bit Knife Clinker (boat building) Stairway Netsuke Bamboo Wood fuel Table saw Hardwood Billiards Chopsticks Longbow Staple (fastener) Violin Timber framing Laser engraving Bokken Katana Nail gun Screw 2000 Australian Grand Prix Timpani Clarinet Tofu Guitar Gramophone record Seismic retrofit Saw Tire Wood carving Lathe Lycanthropy Skateboard Nail (engineering) Rigging Go (board game) Lumber Piano Brush Coppicing Textile manufacturing Pottery The Contender (television series) Gypsy moth Cincinnati Bengals Axe Punt (boat) Japanese tea ceremony Robot Wars Extreme Programming Pittsburgh Steelers Los Angeles Clippers Culture of Korea Cheating in poker Plywood Japanese cuisine Staple gun Allegheny National Forest Michael Thonet Paper Southeast Texas Qiang Diamond cut Kitchen Monopoly (game) Oak Tri-Stat dX Transformer True Cross The Nameless Novel Kasparov versus The World Mattress Geodesic dome Gunsmith Nunchaku Sword making Harp University of Tennessee at Chattanooga Monpa Greg Norman Tree Digital circuit Guqin Piney Woods Wood router Arcade cabinet Cello President (game) Chicago Bulls Railroad switch Casting Tariff Whose Line Is It Anyway?

can i spray paint chilren's chairs they are wood i have these wooden chairs i don't want to paint them with a brush because the wood looks dry and i'll need primer i suppose it is just two little chairs will spray paint work yes you can do not use a latex spray as it will not adhere well to the factory finish i would recommend a oil based spray paint to promote adhesion the other thing that you should know is that you need to clean the chairs first if there is any oil or dirt on the chairs the spray paint will have a hard time sticking use light coats two light coats are better than one heavy coat if you would like to have them last for a long time let them dry for about a week and then wax them with an automotive wax this will seal the chairs and harden the paint if anyone spills anything on them it will just run off instead of penetrating into the paint  HyperText Transfer Protocol Web server Ajax (programming) World Wide Web Website Carousel Gmail Hersheypark GameFAQs HTML Web browser Web page Six Flags Over Texas Wget Blog Representational State Transfer Web traffic Cross site scripting Disneyland Apache HTTP Server Spyware PHP Web design HTML element ASP.NET Uniform Resource Identifier Web application HTTP cookie Server-side scripting Phishing Mozilla Firefox Amazon.com CPAN Internet Speculative Fiction Database Java Servlet Coney Island Mod python Solar variation Google Thorpe Park Electronic commerce Web crawler Horse Quicksort Lotus Notes Btrieve Knoebels Common Unix Printing System Unix Proxy server Eventing Captcha Internet Explorer Merrie Melodies Streaming media Television in the United States Alton Towers Sylvia and Gerry Anderson BitTorrent Equine conformation Virtual hosting Hello world program Carousel of Progress Amusement park Domain Name System Saturn V Enterprise content management The Merry Wives of Windsor Slashdot trolling phenomena The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (film) Web hosting Common Gateway Interface Solar system MySQL Geographic information system Amateur astronomy Windows XP History of the Internet Knott's Berry Farm Google search Paramount Canada's Wonderland Google bomb Carolwood Pacific Railroad Domain name Transmission Control Protocol Sesame Workshop The Return of the King Amusement ride Magic Kingdom Search engine optimization Slash (punctuation) Application service provider Neopets PHP-Nuke Maid Marian and her Merry Men Microsoft Library (computer science) B3ta Extraterrestrial hypothesis

damp smell in bathroom a few weeks ago i noticed my toilet cistern had been leaking it soaked into the skirting board and soaked the laminate flooring at the back of the toilet i got it fixed as soon as i discovered the problem but now there is a really overpowering damp smell in the bathroom apart from ripping up the floor which i really dont want to do can you suggest any ways to get rid of the smell i keep the windows and doors open all the time already hi groid lots of other things i'd need to know before i can 'reliably' answer your question but i'll make a few guesses and possibly provide a solution my guess is that the cistern had been leaking for some time and the water has worked through the gaps in the laminate flooring and has soaked the material underneath guess no is that you have chipboard flooring as opposed to traditional floorboards made of solid wood chipboard is often used in modern houses or conversions as it's cheaper chipboard soaks in water like a sponge and takes ages to dry out quite often it needs to be replaced now the gross bit the area at the back of the toilet is usually a bit smelly as over time the area can be splashed with urine from men using the toilet in a standing position hope that's not too graphic this urine can also soak into the material under the laminate the smell is probably the water mixing with the residual urine unfortunately the only way to find out is to lift the laminate floor the chipboard will take months to dry out on it's own honest groid lifting the laminate floor is not as difficult as it seems unless it's been laid under the toilet remove one of the edging strips that runs parallel to the laminate nearest the area it will just be held in with panel pins use a wallpaper scraper to prise it off once you've done that the sheet of laminate underneath should just lift out they literally just click into each other remove or lengths keep them in order so you can put them back the right way you should be able to see very quickly if the area underneath is damp dry chipboard is almost warm to the touch damp chipboard will be cold if the chipboard is as i suspect damp the cheapest thing to do would be to hire a dehumidifier from a tool hire shop should cost around a day remove as much of the laminate as you can and run the dehumidifier for at least days ps don't run it when you have a shower it will have a nervous breakdown dehumidifiers suck a huge amount of moisture out of the area just might do the trick good luck boris  Bubble Bobble Spirit level Rainbow Islands Bubble Symphony Soap bubble Siphon Sonoluminescence Mario Bros.

any suggestions on how to fix a gap left between door jambs and wood laminate we installed wood laminate flooring throughout an entire floor of our house it looks great the only thing wrong is that the instructions failed to mention cutting the door jamb and sliding the laminte underneath now that it's done it seems obvious but we now have to deal with gap between every door jamb or entry way which we left for expansion quarter round won't work in these areas and caulk makes the floor look sloppy anybody else ever encounter this problem and find a clean solution thanks with all due respect and after installing thousands of sq ft of various flooring knowledge is often attained after we need it the issue could have been lessened with a few methods a saw specific to molding cuts for flooring setting a piece of flooring and underlayment against any molding for more accurate cuts lined with a pencil and then even using a back saw obviously those two suggestions are too late expansion issues relate to high humidity and or a floor that floods on a regular basis laminate is already designed to give but no manufacturer could stay in business selling a product that swells expands and contract in any percentage as you suggest you have a daunting task no matter certainly if you can you might find the same molding and cut inch pieces to be glued in or do that for the jambs at this point you might not ever be satisfied  Mouse (computing) Vacuum cleaner Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Universal Serial Bus Carburetor James Dyson Floppy disk Upholstery Poker jargon Relay USB flash drive Cheating in Counter-Strike Toyota Prius Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Violin Elevator Fan (implement) Harmonica Airsoft Bong BS 1363 TGV Wrench Glossary of climbing terms Professional wrestling throws Die (manufacturing) Guitar Atari 8-bit family Glossary of American football Semiconductor device Sega Dreamcast Plane (tool) Oscilloscope Diode Printed circuit board Strap-on dildo Jack plug Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Aerial (dance move) Diving regulator Rail terminology Cartridge (firearms) Archery Internal ballistics Undergarment Hand grenade Chevrolet Camaro Zippo STS-61 Mattress Vacuum Lawn mower Windows XP Embedded system ZX Spectrum Knife Earring Electric motor Vise (tool) Switch Cathode ray tube Spark gap Disc brake Dyson (appliances) Roomba Screwdriver Light rail Hard disk Advertising Object Desktop Drill Light switch National Football League Lore CPU design Secure Digital card Windows 2000 Spark plug Eggerland series Soldering 2000 Australian Grand Prix De Lorean DMC-12 Cruise control The Tomb of the Cybermen Floyd Rose Tungsten Handheld Computer case Opera (web browser) Thermostat Wire wrap Tooth enamel GLOCK P-n junction Steyr Mannlicher M1901 Worms weapons and tools Woodworking ATX Curling

is tensioning necessary for field fencing with t posts i want to put up fencing to keep neighbor dogs and coyotes off my property but know little about it i won't be keeping animals inside just protecting my cats and garden from predators i bought ' high woven wire field fencing and six foot t posts my land is hilly and the fence will be climbing up and down its entire length it is soft dirt in spots hard clay in others with no rocks anywhere i've seen some places say wooden corner braces are unnecessary that you can make braces from t posts using the right widgets i'm interested in that because you wouldn't have to dig post holes however no site describes how to tension this sort of t post only field fence let's say i did install wooden corner braces and try to tension the fence how could i tension that with the land being as uneven as it is is tensioning even necesary in this situation maybe just rounding the corners would work after miles of fence i have a suggestion or two your corner posts should likely be a bit more substantial even using chain link fence corners tension in your type can be accomplished with help and not strictly as tight as chain link though some of the critters you describe might either climb or dig if you are able and have the option you might walk the line and determine the corners then best determine the support mechanism ie anchor wires angled away from each corner concrete poured into the cornet post holes etc with chain link when i do it alone i use a come along in multiples and wire bracket the fence section at each post as i move along in your case you probably can do the same even just with one other person pulling to provide the needed tension don't use wood at the corners if the tension preceding has been accomplished do the same and yes wrap if possible to keep from having to cut and start again again the greater issue might be at ground level and access through under by any critters steven wolf  Dishwasher Dishwashing Menstrual cup Detergent Japanese toilet Dry cleaning Car washing techniques Laundry detergent Toilet paper Urinal Vinegar Sento Sodium hypochlorite Kitchen Soap Wheat Washing machine Manicure Priestly Code Toilet Bathroom Trisodium phosphate E-6 process Brush Vacuum cleaner Tessellation Brewery Water purification Dundas Square 1,4-dichlorobenzene Disinfection Contact lens Halitosis Blood Simple Dymaxion house Listerine Hard water Fecal incontinence Champagne (beverage) Garden Strawberry Copper Wallpaper group Biblical scientific foresight Textile manufacturing Car wash Bidet Hand washing Carpet Paper Ozone Hydrogen peroxide Ice resurfacer Plating Coir Autonomous building Jackass: The Movie Mattress Kosher foods Cheese Upholstery Dairy Pepper spray Water mould Bleach Bulk vending Laundry Water Cleanliness National Kidney Foundation Singapore Nocturnal emission Home repair Domestic water system Tattoo Caving Japanese tea ceremony My Name Is Earl Toilet humour Electrostatic precipitator Pet skunk Salah Ammonia Air pollution Smegma Social rule Unclean animals Body piercing Hebburn Penrose tiling Bleach (manga) Irrigation Xanadu House Queensbridge Genericized trademark Agricultural wastewater treatment Industrial wastewater treatment Fountain White phosphorus incendiary Glossary of nautical terms Drill bit

can some one give me a step by step process to tiling our kitchen floor i am wanting to put tile down in our kitchen could you please give me what products i will need and the step by step process to tiling the floor thanks this q has been asked and answered often and can be checked thru q a search pretty much because detailing it here is lengthy after installing multiple thousands of sq ft of tile though i'd be happy to detail deeper in e mail the obvious is measure the room and choose a tile style and size the size might be best dictated by the size of the area you want to cover the examples are also pretty obvious as for the most part they relate to feet either in inch or larger combined not knowing at all what the finish of the floor is currently that is an issue i remove any existing finish surface once the sub floor prep has been accomplished the floor checked for level voids rises then it's time to square the room the point is to measure and depending on your choice of tile size determine the layout to square a room run two perpendicular lines snapped as close to a center point as possible from those intersecting lines determine the layout i usually do lay out a course in either direction to best get an idea of the finish and any cuts example in a room that measures ft wide for instance and your choice is tiles you'll add an inch to the tile size every tiles for grout lines assume then at the perimeter you'll have cuts lay out the center allowing that cuts are either on one side that might not be so visible or split the difference if need be that equates to actually being able to move off the center lines depending on your room size layout and and obstructions etc it might also be important if you transition to an adjacent room once the sub floor has been prepped well cleaned and your layout determined i suggest remove any cove base molding begin in that middle but allow that you won't paint tile yourself into a corner you can't get out of using the proper mortar i use a poly blend thin set mix a bucket to allow that you work in small easy to manage areas ie sq ft at a time always moving away from the set tiles i use a flat edge blade mortar trowel with inch teeth once the mortar is applied excess moved to an empty space and no voids are left then place your first and every piece use rubber spacers to keep the grout lines and tiles running straight press gently down on the tile no need to mash into the mortar with a heavy hand i use a level and my hand to determine one flush with any adjacent you can use the rubber spacers to remove any mortar squeezed up into the grout lines save cuts for last and make them all at the same time to install the next day hours is usual for mortar set dry the issue should allow that your cuts are the same width at least as a grout line from the perimeter walls cabinets etc for kitchens i usually remove move both the stove and oven not the cabinets if you have pantry or closets in the kitchen they will likely need additional cuts once the cuts have been set and another hours perhaps if you have the time then begin the grout that as should the mortar be mixed to the consistency of mashed potato the issue with grout is that it sets in the bucket a bit faster than mortar so again work small areas again i use a poly blend with a paint stick paint scraper etc and or the rubberized grouting trowel you'll have to buy i suggest or more work the grout into the grout lines allowing that it presses to the sub floor and you get out any possible air bubbles which will become voids trowel at angles to the grout lines the process is designed to use the tool as a squeegie and at angles you aid the leveling of the grout again work small areas and have help if possible one to apply one to clean after in that small area take the flat large grout sponge just damp and wipe at angles as you did with the squeegie to get up any excess grout as the grout sets the sponging can be increasingly more wet that process if the squeegie was done correctly can be stages the grout will be just below the actual floor tile surface but should fill to the depressed edges of the tile piece once you gotten the grout to what seems to be relatively clean stop wiping don't over sponge or over wet in the process water as needed as it is also inhibits or degrades the agents in mortar or grout within another hours you'll see a film on the tile that can be mopped away given the proper procedures and timing the floor can be walked on and used by the third day hopefully when replacing tables chairs bakers shelving etc carry the piece to its place don't drag it across the new floor replace the cove base hiding the free space and any possible ooops buy no less than over what you need for waste and cuts btw my thought about equalizing cuts in size might equate to using one piece of full tile for two pieces of cut tile at the perimeters steven wolf if i've confused you or left out any

how can i remove carpet glue from my concrete basement floor i had berber carpet in the basement and had to remove it to my dismay the concrete floor underneath is now covered in glue what must i do to remove the glue i am looking for an easy solution regardless of cost other than paying someone else to do it of course like diy doc said avoid solvents at best they'll just soften the adhesive and make a bigger mess this requires mechanical removal scraping or grinding if the original carpet was installed with padding under it you probably have snail trails of a rubbery glue zig zagging around the room if the carpet was applied directly to the concrete it's probably a hard mastic like adhesive sort of a yellowish off white color for the rubbery stuff you'll need a scraper with a thin replaceable razor like blade these come in both a short handled version you use on your hands and knees and a long handled version you use standing up the short handled version has a thinner sharper blade and does a more thorough removal but the long handled version is a lot easier on your body you can also use a disc sander with a coarse grit sand paper but you'll go through a lot of sand paper this way fyi the short handled scraper usually comes with spare blades stashed inside the handle easy to miss if you don't know to look there for the hard thick adhesive you'll need a heavier scraper but not the thick bladed ones intended for tile removal the blades on those aren't sharp enough to cut the adhesive you can use the long handled scraper described above but he best fastest tool for this is a pneumatic scraper using an air compressor the pneumatic scraper works kind of like a jack hammer and does most of the work for you you can rent them at homedepot or your local rental yard scraping will get you to a smooth floor ready for new tile carpet wood but if you need bare concrete because you want to stain or paint epoxy it you're going to need a concrete floor grinder a concrete floor grinder uses either carbide cutting bits or carbide abrasive pucks to literaly grinds away a thin layer of concrete along with whatever's stuck to it it's extremely noisy and dusty but if you need to take the floor to bare concrete it's your tool there are two types the larger one uses a machine just like the commercial floor buffers you see janitors using but with a special plate that holds the cutters for spot work there's also a smaller one that looks like a router on steroids if your entire floor is covered with adhesive you'll need the big buffer model if you've got the snail trails either model will work but the hand held model will be less messy because you're only grinding a swath instead of the of the bigger model you may have to call around to find a rental yard that has a floor grinder of my local homedepot's rent them p s manually scraping is hard work it's tough to put in a full day scraping and it will take days unless it has to be done right now consider working at it an hour each evening after work or better yet recruit the whole family and take turns at it if you go with the grinder plan on a day to a day and a half to do a sf room  Pontoon bridge Anchor Alcoholic beverage USS Tunny (SS-282) Beaver Vinegar Anatidae Washington German cuisine Acorn Abbey Fly fishing Cuisine of Denmark Wood USS Wahoo (SS-238) Seismic retrofit Cider Tuff Skittles (sport) Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Water garden Rock, Paper, Scissors Wood Duck Architecture of the California missions Roman eating and drinking Altar Bridge Panama Canal Dinghy Boat Shipwreck Hey Arnold!

should i use colored grout sealer grout dye i tiled my kitchen about days ago everything looks great however the grout lines have already become discolored and i have one oil stain that won't come out i'm guessing that i didn't do a good enough job sealing re grouting is not an option that i want to undertake i don't want to use a harsh chemical to clean because it is a colored grout i wonder if anyone has had any experience with those colorant grout sealers aka grout dye can i effectively recolor my grout line with a colored sealer and once that is cured finish it with a grout sealer finish i've' seen sites like groutarmor com and tilestone ca is this method of restoring grout lines recommended furthermore has anyone had first hand experience and can recommend a brand or company that i can purchase from and do it myself the color of the sealer is a light brown it's called haystack i tried cleaning the grout with vineager water in an inconspicuous area and the grout became discolored i tried again with a different product in a different area and it really discolored the grout line the reason i am interested in the sealer is because i live with messy roomates and the kitchen grout will not last i figured that a colored grout sealer would be best a lot of them have to year warranties where if properly maintained you would only have to reseal once every years if i have to clean the grout before i color the grout that's fine the colorant will evenly coat the grout so the dicoloring from cleaning won't matter after thousands of sq ft of tile and gallons of grout i personally don't like sealers obviously they sell the market pretty much dictates that one must use sigh with all due respect what color might the grout have been most are in colors anyway re grouting would be a mess labor intensive and possibly damage tile i suggest chemicals to at least attempt the cleaning certainly i'd never advise sealing dirt in grout sealer usually is clear as i said i've been at this long time and have always been skeptical of the success rate beyond that sealer needs constant maintenance and re sealing for a dye to be most effective at this point you'll have to clean the tile and grout lines steven wolf  Minute of arc English unit Inch Apollo Command/Service Module U.S. customary units History of measurement Metre New York Navy Yard Angle Opportunity rover Fossil fuel power plant Imperial unit Yardarm Lacrosse Grand Union Canal Metrified English unit USS Hoel (DD-533) Metrication arguments and counter-arguments Mount St. Helens Iowa class battleship Tallit Chain (unit) Hurdling Comparative metrology Dimensional analysis Admiral Hipper class cruiser USS Vincennes (CA-44) Sniper Pressure Hume's principle Super Bowl XIII Comparison of Canadian and American football 3.7 Inch Mountain Howitzer R33 World's Fair (New York City Subway car) Stanley Cup HMS Electra (H27) Textile manufacturing Brown v.

has anyone ever used those self stick tiles they sell at discount stores looking to use some in my bathroom because right now it's just ugly we rent any ideas or advice vinyl tiles with the sticky backs are great i like them they look pretty nice when laid properly when i install them i have laid them directly on top of the old flooring and other times i have installed inch plywood over the old flooring before laying tiles the most important thing to do is make sure your floor is clean dust free and make sure you keep checking for cleanliness through your installation if the floor is dusty the tile won't stick to the floor as well it helps make the job look better if the floor is flat for the tough corners i used one of the backing sheets and drew the pattern i needed out on it before cutting the vinyl tile this helped make for a more accurate job with less waste self stick vinyl tiles are an inexpensive and easy way to make an ugly floor look nice you can find pretty much any sort of pattern and all you need is a good carpet knife or box cutter to work with them i've seen some pretty creative vinyl tiles have fun keep your work area clean at all times and don't cut yourself  Thermostat Furnace Thermal power station Solar power HVAC Apollo 13 Heat Spark plug Stove Vacuum tube Transformer Refrigerator Hot air balloon Electric arc furnace Spacecraft propulsion Thermocouple Air conditioning STS-87 Welding Explosive material Incandescent light bulb Fossil fuel power plant Turbocharger STS-62 Bi-metal Electric motor Two-stroke cycle Burglar alarm Control system Gas tungsten arc welding Ignition system Gas metal arc welding Motor oil Stirling engine Jet engine Three-phase electric power Steam engine Electrical wiring Incineration Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Autonomous building Ceramics Supercharger Fluorescent lamp Thermoregulation Sensor Circuit breaker Fuse (electrical) Fire fighting Peltier-Seebeck effect Mercury arc valve Boiling point Resistor Casting Turbojet Phase change heat pump High-voltage hazards Electrodeless lamp Directed-energy weapon Fan (implement) James Prescott Joule Space shuttle main engine Switched-mode power supply Sun Wind power Powder metallurgy Magnet Fuel cell Cold fusion Hysteresis Solar cell Nuclear fusion Degree Celsius Phase (matter) Thermistor Wind turbine Tesla coil Diode Spectroscopy Negative feedback Renewable energy Specific heat capacity Cremation Internal ballistics Oxygen sensor Water (molecule) Transistor Tank Gas turbine Plasma (physics) Rail terminology

would this work fabric room divider i want a divider in my room to have two sections and i'd like it to be fabric i want to hang the fabric from the ceiling like with a ceiling track my question is would it be easier cheaper to just hang a curtain rod on the ceiling and hang it from there to me it seems exactly like a regular window curtain would work my mom thinks it won't work anything else i could do or things i need to consider when hanging something from a ceiling i'm reading and re reading and re reading to make sure i get everything right you didn't say house or apartment or home so i'm guessing rental i love the track idea there has to be something out there to hang in the studs in the ceiling that you can clip onto the fabric either onto the fabric or onto grommets in the fabric as for the fabric itself wa ha rubbing my hands together you or your mom or someone has to know how to sew it just must be done or learned something then head out to the fabric store buy a gorgeous fabric that accents your living room over buy it in length so that you can get some great not pleats per se but waves like gathers you know what i'm saying make sure it is long enough to go from ceiling to floor depending on how you want it to look with the curtains open to the kitchen you can have it open to two sides and held back or you could do it into three sections and use scraps attached to the curtain sides to tie it as it goes back giving you two sides and a middle that would be just gorgeous now for the kitchen back i'm taking it your kitchen isn't really big enough to have people in it while you are in it so the backing really isn't going to matter however you will need something back there maybe a batting or something to make sure that grease from the kitchen doesn't get onto it also check your fabric to make sure it's washable maybe launder first before sewing to get the sizing correct because it's going to be between those rooms it will soak up the smells from the kitchen and may get stained sounds gorgeous and like something i had wanted to do for our theatre room in the basement have fun and good luck  Kitchen Door Hamster Floppy disk Combine (Half-Life 2) The Brady Bunch Textile manufacturing JavaServer Pages Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Knife Sundial Frankfurt kitchen RuneScape quests Passenger car Refrigerator Betting (poker) Shaggy dog story Poker jargon Mozilla Firefox The Penultimate Peril TARDIS Sento Wood carving Bristol Grammar School Fancy rat Jumpstart 3rd Grade USB flash drive The Shining (film) StarCraft: Uprising McMansion PHP Richard Chase View camera B-47 Stratojet Station wagon Paper size Xanadu House Screw Japanese tea ceremony Bus models used in New York City Transit Laptop IPod Washing machine Unix Bong The Cure Abbey Casting Glossary of firefighting equipment Chainsaw Wrigley Field MTR OpenBSD The Time Machine Stove Animal Crossing Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Mach kernel Bassoon Ammunition House IBM PC compatible Punch card Hard disk Paper towel Asbestos Window Violin Sushi Glossary of firefighting terms The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time The Ersatz Elevator Dishwasher Upholstery G-Man (Half-Life) Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Dean Koontz Glossary of nautical terms Elevator Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory The Truman Show Top-bar hive Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Shoe Spyware Domain Name System Secretary desk Items in the Metroid series Futurama (TV series - season 4) Fire fighting Seismic retrofit Chatsworth House Cyndi Lauper Opportunity rover Blood Simple Sin City Paragliding HyperText Transfer Protocol Kayak

rewiring a ceiling fan reinstalling existing fan lights work fan does not however there is a slight audible hum coming from motor has separate controls is could the wires be connected wrong or is the motor burned out in addition this fan worked before removal so if the motor is damaged can you cause this to happen if it was hooked up wrong also happened to my fan on range hood thanks in advance to all who understand electricity this is so frustrating ok proper hook up sounds like you have swapped a hot wire for the neutral no problem for the motor as it is on the same phase so you have two wires coming from the switch on the wall you say independent controls this is on the fan itself the black wire from the wall switch should be placed on wire going to the light switch and the wire one of them going to the fan motor the real problem is this one of the wires to the switch of the fan is a common the others are for the speeds you need to get an ohm meter and see which wire is common to all the other output wires this is where the black wire from the switch goes to the others go to the coil if the fan for speeds if these are not attached it is nor real important at this time to get those right just hook them to the motor i would leave the light wiring alone as you say it is ok the humm is caused by the wiring being crossed on the switch you won't blow the motor the white wires combine to attach to the white wire going to the switch some older homes may have two blacks coming to the light socket in that case you need to get a volt meter and figure out which is hot and which is neutral a little trial and error it'ss work fine  Tile Masonry Drywall Ra (board game) Wallpaper Dominoes Gypsum Tile-based game Mahjong Home repair Carcassonne (board game) Seismic retrofit Acquire Wallpaper group Atomic Kitten Basement Prim's algorithm Guastavino tile Varnish Warhammer 40,000 Titanium Roof Brush Dundas Square M.C.

how to frame an exterior door window opening i'm making a ft x ft shed and i'm wondering how to frame the exterior door window part i saw somewhere online how to do it using king studs and jack studs and then putting cripple studs under the window opening and above the window opening and similarly for the door i'm wondering if i have to make a header board or is this method of doing it fine it's a foot opening for the door first let's define a few terms a king stud is a full length stud usually that forms the outer part of the frame for a door or window a jack stud which i call a trimmer is a shorter stud that supports the header above a door or window a cripple is a short stud between the header and the top plate or under a window between the bottom plate and the sill the header transfers the vertical load above a window or door opening to the trimmers in your situation the load may not be significant since the shed is most likely single story the international residential code in table r says that the maximum span for a header consisting of two x s or one x is ' for two x s or one x it is ' and for two x s or one x it is ' in your case with a foot door you should use a x header the rough opening for doors is generally inches wider and inches taller than the nominal door size thus if you have a door meaning the width is ' and the height is ' the rough opening should be wide by high that means you will cut the trimmers to furthermore the header is longer than the rough opening to allow for a trimmer on each end in this case for a door you'll need a x header long to assemble the door frame nail each trimmer to a king stud using a penny nail every two feet then nail the x on top of the trimmer using four penny nails on each end driven through the king stud when you nail the frame to the x bottom plate and cut out the bottom plate for the door the rough opening will be by finish the frame by cutting cripples to fit between the header and the top plate you propose to have a foot door i assume you mean a pair of doors the rough opening is inches wide by inches high as mentioned above you'll need a x header cut to long as before the trimmers are long the header is nailed to the king studs with eight penny nails on each end windows are framed similarly to doors except that the space below the window is filled with a sill and cripples unlike doors though the rough opening for a window is usually the same as the nominal window size the rough opening for a window is therefore inches wide by inches high the trimmers are the same as for doors the header for a window is a inch x the cripples under the window are long each window should be checked for the correct rough opening some manufacturers deviate from the nominal window dimensions the window frame is assembled by nailing the trimmers to the king studs then nailing a cripple to each trimmer the x header is nailed in place with six penny nails on each end now a sill is nailed to the tops of the cripples several more cripples are nailed to the sill and the header so that there is a stud every inches actually the entire wall should be framed so that a stud trimmer or cripple falls on centers this may require an extra stud or two but is necessary for nailing plywood or t siding to the wall the nailing schedule is often every on the edges and every in the field center penny galvanized nails should be used  Domestic AC power plugs and sockets X10 (industry standard) Enigma machine BS 1363 Residual-current device Musical Instrument Digital Interface Power strip Modem Fuse (electrical) Vacuum tube Transformer Electric motor Embedded system Game Boy Advance Spark plug Light switch Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Digital circuit Grand Central Terminal Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Remote control SCART Distribution board Ignition system Magnetic core memory IPod Telephone exchange Alternating current Seismometer Switch Electricity meter E85 Headlight Secure Digital card Universal Serial Bus ZigBee Oscilloscope Xbox Thermostat Model aircraft USB flash drive Programmable logic controller Ford Crown Victoria Japanese toilet Armored Core Spark gap Jack plug WEPN Electrical wiring (UK) Floppy disk Transmitter Airbag Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Commodore 64 Printed circuit board Hall effect Federal Standard 1037C Automotive lighting WSCR NBC Carburetor Aircraft engine controls Transistor Disc jockey Digital photography Nintendo Tire Glow plug European Installation Bus Naval mine Power line communication Home Box Office Laptop NVIDIA Digital Personal computer Paul Is Dead Extension Cord Fuel injection The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Burglar alarm Mattress Radio controlled airplane Computer animation Bullet Atari 8-bit family Battery electric vehicle Mercury Atlas 6 Telegraphy Flush toilet Professional wrestling slang Cliff Richard Incandescent light bulb TIA-568A/B Xbox 360 Ethernet TGV

ok diy question now im buying a house and long story short the guys that put the furniture in the house it comes furnished with new furniture banged the legs of tables chairs couches and everything else against the corners of the halls so these dents are like inches long and are like craters in the corners i need to know how to patch the corners and make them not craters i know it can be done but i dont know how i tried getting the seller to fix them but no luck and the seller and his buddies brought the furniture in and im absolutely not going to sue so if i buy that patch stuff how do i get it to stay the shape of the wall steps please or maybe a link to a website that shows how im not going to hire anyone the corners are straight then when you get to the dent they curve in its very unattractive and in some places they curve in and then they curve in more have you ever done anything like that there are numerous types of drywall patch mud available ranging from pre mixed to the boxes of powder you'll also need a drywall putty knife large enough to span the widest portion of the dents and finally you'll need to have sandpaper primer and paint tinted to match the wall's colour the process is relatively simple sand the paint off around and inside the dent try to get it to the exterior paper of the drywall then just scoop out a glob of mud and spread it out into the dent flip the knife over and pull upwards smoothing out the mud and collecting the excess repeat the process until you have a fairly smooth finish when it hardens wrap the sandpaper around a wooden block and sand the surface smooth use a circular motion like wax on wax off you might need to repeat the process for really deep dents or dents which have broken through the backside of the drywall then primer and paint on corners it requires a little more effort on small dents simply work one side then the other sanding and reapplying as needed to get a nice finish the problem with corners are the corner beads a thin soft paper and metal strips that are covered with drywall mud if the corner beads are really badly dented you'll need to cut out the affected section and insert a new piece most hardware stores carry corner beads they're sold in eight foot strips so one should be enough for patches once you've cut out the affacted section clean up any excess drywall slather on some mud and press the corner bead into position let it dry then apply mud over the surface on both sides sanding and reapplying as needed until the corner bead is covered by a thin finished coating of mud then primer and paint  Domestic AC power plugs and sockets National Electrical Code (US) Residual-current device Electrical wiring Kitchen Electrical wiring (UK) Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets High-voltage hazards Extreme Programming The Brady Bunch Ground and neutral BS 1363 Cruising (maritime) Telephone tapping Glossary of firefighting terms Welding 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Elevator Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Distribution board Three-phase electric power McMansion Fuse (electrical) Apollo 13 Earthing system Burglar alarm Airbus A380 Spark plug Scientology beliefs and practices Transformer Insurance Knife Health insurance Thermal power station Syphon Filter Firefighter Telephone numbering plan X10 (industry standard) The Penultimate Peril Current (electricity) Antenna (radio) Internet fraud Japanese toilet Plame affair Incandescent light bulb Explosive material A Course In Miracles Split phase Seismic retrofit Space disaster Loudspeaker Switch Geodesic dome Tesla coil Tank Lawn mower Tire Lionel Corporation Light switch Oscilloscope Electric shock B-47 Stratojet National Weather Service Fire extinguisher Chatsworth House Battery (electricity) Pebble bed reactor Hamster Columbine High School massacre Passenger car Sin City Shaggy dog story Dormitory Wire Universal Serial Bus The Strangerhood Circuit design V.F.D.

how can i get rid of roaches in an apartment i live in an apartment complex and there is a really bad roach infestation we have complained to the office many times and they say they are treating for them we get these little notes from the bug man who say he is going to come spray for bugs but they only spray the outside of the bottem apartments we have them so bad that i have had to move all of my food out of the pantry because of a huge roach nest that is in it yuk also i had to throw away my dogs bed because they made a nest in it they are just all over i am tired of being told its getting taken care of when it is not so my question is what can i do to get rid of them being that i live in an apartment i mean we can't bomb the house and that wouldn't work anyways would it be possible to get some kind of exterminator to come and then we just give them the bill i mean i know you can do that if you live in a house and would it even do any good to spray for roaches in just my apartment we live in one upstairs i don't need to know of an exterminator i know one who wiped them out of our last house for us i just don't know if it would be ok to call him and have him treat only our apartment i don't know if that would do any good and if i did that i would want the apartment people to pay for it ok i'm insulted my apartment is very clean i'm just poor and live in crapy apartments i've complained several times to both the apartment manager and the pest company but they refuse to do anything except spray the bottom outside apartments my neighbors are filthy and their nastiness is coming into our apartment i don't know what kind of legalities there are for such a problem so if you know some texas renting laws let me know if you only have stupid answers don't waste my time i am very serious and am even considering talking to lawyers about this it is unlikely that just treating your own apartment will get rid of the roaches but it would probably help control them a little you can buy boric acid at home depot or some other hardware type store and put it in all of the cracks and crevices you can find you can also buy your own insecticide and spray whether or not you can hire an exterminator and force management to pay depends on your state county or city laws do you have rent control if so try to locate the nearest rent control office and call them if not most big cities have some kind of governmental landlord tenant association whose job is to help tenants and landlords work within the law and to inform them just what that law is they will know if you can hire an exterminator and either force management to pay or withhold the amount you pay from the rent another option is to contact the board of health and explain the situation to them if it's bad enough it may be actionable in which case the board of health will go after management don't feel guilty about complaining if it's that bad they need to be complained about good luck  Whois HTML British small press comics Glacier Postage stamp Plastic Internet fraud Live 8 Drill bit Opera (web browser) Gramophone record Rubber Tax Paper size Textile manufacturing terminology Offset printing Autograph Gmail Diving suit Table tennis Dairy Bank Tire Mach kernel Flat file database Japanese tea ceremony Software engineering Glass Amazon.com Casting ZX Spectrum Cascading Style Sheets The Foundation Series Leaf Landfill Shoe Inventory Mozilla Firefox Grand Teton National Park Motorcycle helmet Phishing MIME Repouss__ and chasing G__del's incompleteness theorem Wallpaper group Denial-of-service attack Sushi Enigma machine Cross site scripting Independent Media Center IPod Internet Explorer for Mac Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Welding Legal research Europa (moon) Minstrel show Binary and text files Sea ice Richard Stallman Vulcanization Mattress E-mail spam Pontianak, Indonesia Online auction business model Bulk vending Botany Coir Homer Simpson RAS syndrome T-800 Spam (electronic) Chlorophyta Typewriter Mirror Programming language Massage Softball Domain Name System Skype Brodie helmet Reactive armour Geology of Venus Internet Group Management Protocol Advance fee fraud Roswell UFO incident Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Continuously variable transmission The Shining (film) Battery (electricity) Direct marketing Kazaa Violin Wal-Mart Nagercoil Congress of Industrial Organizations MobyGames Enceladus (moon)

wood finshing question i made a shelf and i put finsh on it but where i cut it the finsh doesn't look good it's hard to explain i sanded it really good but still the same is there any finsh that will cover the ends really good help surjestions what you are describing is the difficulty with staining the cross grain the other answers are correct in that the cross grain will definitely absorb a much larger amount of stain than the other surfaces here's the reason why a piece of wood is very much like a bundle of microscopic straws laying side by side in multiple layers if you pour water on the sides of the straws it doesn't take much to cover the surface but if you pour water on the end of the straws it takes a lot more water to fill it up so what's the solution now that you've already stained the cross grain there's not much you can do short of cutting the shelf shorter and starting again you could buy moulding or laminate the ends and stain that to match in the future to prevent over absorption of stain by the cross grain apply a coat of shellac to the cross grain before staining the shellac seals the cross grain and limits the amount of stain absorbed  Bedbug Leasehold estate Poker jargon Theory of conduct Social rule Avenue Q Estoppel Housing cooperative Public housing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Apartment Babylonian law Plame affair Rent control Harlem Health insurance The Commons Leasing The Inside Humphrey Bogart Mental Health Act 1983 Vista Way 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Rosa Parks Karl Rove Rent (musical) National Kidney Foundation Singapore Animal Crossing Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Diseases of the honeybee Prostitution Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Leo Frank Friends Monopoly (game) Contract Freeters The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Meat Loaf Eviction Chatham Square Ashton-Tate W.

how do i fix a hole in a plastic children's slide the flap of plastic is still on there but the inch hole caved in at the middle of the slide it doesn't have to look pretty it just has to work the slide itself is part of a play gym and to replace it would be about please don't tell me duct tape you could attach cardboard on the back to support a repair with epoxy epoxy is very strong and should bond to plastic that has been sanded to make it porous once the area is supported mix epoxy and spread it over the area try to make it as smooth as possible if you do a very nice job you may not need to sand it afterwards if it is rough after drying you can sand grind it smooth and give it another thin coat of epoxy to finish it off nice the best epoxy to use is the minute kind it costs about for a modest quantity of it you don't need a lot of epoxy it gets very hard when it cures the minute kind will be easier to work with and will also look better when you're done when mixing epoxy use a piece of cardboard and a popsicle stick you can also use a popsicle stick to apply it too one thing to remember about epoxy is that it is difficult to get off your hands either wear gloves or use tools to spread it around  Australian English Screw Quarters Conan the Barbarian Whose Line Is It Anyway?

when do i need to use a ridge vent and or soffit vents i'm building a shed and the plans that i have calls for putting in a ridge vent and a soffit vent do i really need to put these in i thought vents were for better air circulation and are a necessity for an air conditioned building do i need these in a non airconditioned shed if they are needed can i get away with just putting a ridge vent in or do they both need to work in conjunction with each other venting will prevent moisture bulid up it also helps to control the temp in the summer time with no venting a shed will easily heat up to or degrees inside ridge venting and soffit venting work together so one without the other is far less effective than having both together an easier way to vent is to put two peak vents also called wall vents in each on opposing sides of the shed near the peak of the roof these are usually easier to install and do almost as good of a job as soffit and ridge venting  Basement Kitchen HVAC Central heating Scottish Parliament Building Demolition Air-raid shelter North York, Ontario Seismic retrofit International Finance Centre Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew Mechanical floor Eddie Guerrero Firefighter Japanese toilet Lighting Chatsworth House Dundas Square Furnace Mosaic Palladian architecture Collapse of the World Trade Center Bristol Grammar School Solar power Brewery 30 St Mary Axe Timber framing Villa Farnese John Hancock Tower Sento Autonomous building Dealey Plaza Insulation HSBC Hong Kong headquarters building Eaton's Radiator Hebden Bridge Zhengding Deck (ship) Electrical wiring Cray-1 Renewable energy Singapore Flyer New Lanark Passive solar Roman villa Apartment building Epoxy Edward Lovett Pearce Spark plug Elevator Bloody Stupid Johnson Radon Richard Cassels Heat exchanger New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Tate Modern Stairway Library Carpet Reservoir Dogs Tour CIBC Multi-storey car park University of Central Florida Inventory Spyware Platform framing Virginia State Capitol Shotgun house Multi-level marketing Stove Florida Institute of Technology Sicilian Baroque Emerson College New York Stock Exchange Fire alarm control panel Central processing unit Racquetball Fire fighting American University Portsmouth Block Mills Paul Martin __ras an Uachtar__in Robert Lawson (architect) Geodesic dome The Helix Heat David Lee Roth Windows XP Parliament of Finland Home improvement Caracas Red Ribbon Army Chevrolet Corvair King Khalid International Airport Alain Robert Thermae AMC V8 engine

does anyone know which swimming pool pump has the best value for the money for both pool and spa i had a pool built just years ago my spa is not generating any bubbles or jets as it was the first year it has a hayward pump to filter both pool and spa this was highly recommended by the builder but now my pool cleaner guy cleans the filter every week so the spa can get some pressure he says that he wouldn't have bought a hayward pump also said he would have another pump for the spa i don't know anything about pools and want to learn so i don't have to second guess everyone in the pool business i don't have money to burn like some friends of mine that just keeps paying a pool guy to fix everything for them i would like to do it myself and save my money any comments or suggestions are welcomed thank you in advance if you have a single pump for pool and spa and the pump is keeping your pool and spa clean its not the pump hayward is an industry standard pump out of pools have hayward pumps on them most likely it sounds like a configuration problem with your plumbing maybe its not set up properly or your filter grids which decrease your pressure may need to be changed they can become chemically blocked and inefficient check with your pool store to get some cleaning materials for it that may help you rather than buy new filter grids  Dillard University Colony in Space Federal Emergency Management Agency of the United States Tropical cyclone Singaporean response to Hurricane Katrina Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Flood Hurricane Katrina in historical context Political effects of Hurricane Katrina Opie and Anthony Swedish response to Hurricane Katrina Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Alternative theories regarding Hurricane Katrina New Orleans, Louisiana Hurricane Katrina effects by region Emergency preparedness Russel L.

dryer and range cords the same cord two grounding cords we just inherited a very old electric dryer probably years old not really sure but still working well it had a three prong cord whereas our apartment has a prong outlet i did a little online research and found we could just change the cord i went and bought one and tried to plug it in and it looks like it should plug in but just barely doesn't fit then i noticed it said it was a range cord on the packaging i was under the impression they were the same cords also when i screwed in the three wires black white and red to the dryer there was the fourth wire green that i know is meant to be grounded the dryer had a green wire coming out of it that was grounded but that was not attached to the prong cord we removed does this make sense do i need to ground both green wires or can i unscrew the green one that is attached to the dryer please help since the stove cord is heavier gage it could be used for a dryer but the difference is that the ground on the dryer is a different shape as the stove one so you have to replace the cord or the receptacle its easier to just replace the cord the green wire on the cord is a safety ground and is supposed to be hooked to anything that connects to the case of the dryer including a ground wire hanging loose on the dryer none of these other guys even portray a nice blue hat like i do  Knife Acetone Explosive material Silly Putty Plastic Bong Textile manufacturing Kitchen Dishwashing Hydrogen peroxide Baseball Stars Halitosis Agarose gel electrophoresis Organic peroxide Arcade cabinet Paint stripper Emergency preparedness The Shining (film) Dishwasher Tofu Chromatography World War Three (Doctor Who) Western blot Chemical-mechanical planarization Sushi Woodworking Airsoft Table saw Technology Theory of conduct Soldering Shaggy dog story Cruising (maritime) German grammar Teen Girl Squad Scar Mouse (computing) Jack the Ripper Beavis and Butt-head Glass Upholstery Bagel SDS-PAGE ALGOL 68 Striptease Hannibal Lecter Paul Is Dead Nitroglycerin Mach kernel Water purification Aerogel Macbeth Biodiesel Polyethylene terephthalate Poker jargon M16 (rifle) Phase (matter) Mac mini Gaia Online Menstrual cup Gram staining Radio controlled airplane Oakland Athletics Solvent Acetone peroxide Drill bit Ashton-Tate Staining (biology) YuYu Hakusho Stage lighting Duke Nukem 3D Common cold Comanche Sewage treatment Steely Dan Collecting fossils Catastrophic Florida Hurricanes: 1900-1960 Vacutainer Beatmania IIDX Violin Breast implant Seppuku Silicone Video game controversy Dustbin Tooth enamel RuneScape quests Speedloader Glass transition temperature Mathematician Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Taxi Driver RAF Bomber Command Dimethyl sulfoxide Kosher foods Chair Shaving Molecular biology

help for installing a shower into a tub i have a tub with no shower i need to install the shower and necessary plumbing how much would a plumber charge how much would it cost to do it myself and how difficult is it if you can unscrew the tub spout you're in business if the tub is reasonably modern the spout probably does unscrew but it may take some muscle to budge it at first take that spout to lowes of hd or a decent hardware store and tell them you want the same thing except with a diverter valve and nipple i'm not making this up here's a picture to give you the general iea http www neatitems com images diverter spout jpg note that in the picture there's a white plastci threaded connection the nipple in the botom other kinds will have it on the top or somewhere else anyway when you pull the pop up stem on the spout the water is diverted to the nipple that's where you attach a hand held shower which has a pack so you can affix it to the wall of the shower so it works lie an ordinary shower head cheap fix and you get both shower and tub functionality by the way you may need no tools at all to do this but you should get a spool of pipe tape this is thin teflon tape you wrap around the threads of the nipple to make it water tight when you attach the shower head extension you should also apply it to the nipple coming out of the wall when you put on the new spout enjoy  Wood Stairway Mount St. Helens Opportunity rover Chair 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Terminal ballistics USS Scorpion (SS-278) Newspaper Langstroth hive Grand Union Canal Transport Workers Union of America Volcano Pachypodium key to species Oil well Dundas Square Diamond Yellowstone National Park Mount Vesuvius Pachypodium ambongense Tire Hot dog Torpedo Audio tape length and thickness CPU cache 19-inch rack Unemployment Cremation Pachypodium bicolor Thermal power station Cartridge (firearms) Investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 Wishbone Ash Oldsmobile Toronado Pachypodium baronii Daewoo Nubira Outsourcing Breathing gas Tuff Apollo Command/Service Module Geography of the United Kingdom Mount Pinatubo Coppersmith Narrow gauge London Bridge Dodge Challenger Kurdistan Workers Party Fossil fuel power plant Paper size History of the Panama Canal Laws of cricket Brachiopod Pixel Early IBM disk storage Yellow Grass, Saskatchewan Percussion cap Aspect ratio (image) Dot matrix printer Amateur telescope making Buick Skylark Wayne Corporation Gramophone record Harley-Davidson Poliwag Ford Mustang Dodge Charger Items in the Metroid series Pikachu Scale model Type O Negative History of cricket Micrometer Geologic time scale Large format Billiards Oak Island Shotgun Cookware and bakeware Diode Naval mine Wood router View camera O scale Legion of Merit Seattle Mariners M16 (rifle) USS Nautilus (SS-168) Single bullet theory Pok__mon Yellow Iowa class battleship English longbow Bed (furniture) Quake III Arena Mid-size car Wood fuel Carbine Campfire Diego Garcia Abacus Project HARP

why doesnt my toilet flush all the way my toilet wont flush right even if you try to flush it with nothing in it it wont flush you have to plunge it a couple times and then it will go down why take the lid off the toilet and look inside most toilets have a chain plastic or metal that is attached to the flushing handle on end and to the flapper on the other end there shouldn't be much slack but it shouldn't be taut either make sure that the flapper itself is all the way down so that water can fill up in the tank with the tank lid still off flush the toilet and watch for the flush handle actually pulls the chain and flapper up far enough to let most of the water out of the tank and into the bowl see if anything is stuck where the flapper hole is never use those chlorine bleach tabs or any other kind in the tank look at the mechanism that lets water fill up the tank it should function smoothly and stop filling the tank before the water reaches the tube in the center called the overflow or flush valve the filled tank's water level should be about an inch below the top of that overflow tube if none of that seems to help then consider this probably of the reasons a toilet won't flush when the 'guts' inside are otherwise working normally is something got flushed that won't go out the bottom of the toilet q tips are a common cause as are pampers tennis balls little plastic juice bottles tampons big wads of toilet sanitary napkins etc etc etc buy borrow or rent a closet auger a kind of snake made specifically for toilets also i've found that pouring a wastebasket or or of hot water into the toilet letting the water recede in between basketsful if you don't feel comfortable doing plumbing yourself hire a licensed plumber or handyman to do it for you and look at anywhere from to depending on parts material labor time etc  Drill bit Screw Glossary of firefighting equipment Domestic water system Thermal power station Spark plug Hydraulic machinery Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Hard disk Floppy disk Mach kernel Shotgun Textile manufacturing Solar power Pipe organ Universal Serial Bus Equine conformation Cartridge (firearms) Seismic retrofit Brassiere Sento Japanese toilet Wrench Timpani Flush toilet Plumbing fixture Trombone Chevrolet Corvair engine Electrical wiring Bicycle frame Drill bit sizes Paper size Tire Dundas Square Irrigation Whip Pachypodium bicolor Headset (bicycle part) Central heating Kitchen Marching percussion Nintendo GameCube Supply and demand Bristol Grammar School Best Buy BS 1363 Mark I (tank) Glossary of partner dance terms Hydropower Screw thread Laptop Stairway Eyepiece Machine tapers Rigging Caliper Handloading Apollo Command/Service Module Golf club (equipment) Gong Terminal ballistics IBM PC compatible Kammerlader Firearm Bong Earring Scale model Mattress Strap-on dildo Coaxial cable Caliber Billiards Stage lighting Roller hockey Pachypodium ambongense Mossberg 500 Movie projector Weapon Toilet paper Rail terminology Human penis size Prisons in the United States Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Internal ballistics Gramophone record Digital photography Guitar Basement Uilleann pipes Perl Wind power Torpedo Wood Audio tape length and thickness Anemometer RISC Solar system Anchor USB flash drive

should i finish the basement i was going to finish the basement and noticed the floor is really uneven the house was built in the 's and it has two drains in the floor at opposite corners with the floor sloped towards them highest spot is the center of the basement one isn't used the other is used for the washing machine drain should i try and level the floor and plug the drain s i can add a new one i want to put down carpet but want it to look nice will the uneven floor make it look bad to someone who didn't know it was uneven assuming they never saw it before it was finished also should i paint the existing concrete walls and floor with water sealer like kilz thanks it would seem that answerer and i may follow each other around through diy i'm very ok with that obviously a slab with drainage should be sloped to the drain otherwise where is the logic it would seem that when the house was built the likelyhood of water intrusion was considered sad for that other than a washer drain which should be an up pipe anyway i guess my point is have you any water intrusion probelms have you addressed them in stating you can add a new drain have you considered a sump pump have you considered an elevated floor leaving access to any drainage issues with all due respect as much as i use kilz yet dislike priming it will not seal a basement your home no matter where built with a basement should have been tar sealed outside before any backfilling was done if that isn't the case water seepage and intrusion will always be a problem no matter how many coats of any substance you apply to the interior walls below ground level beyond that what's the condition generally speaking of the floor forget uneven are there stress settling cracks i'm re doing on a constant basis sq ft of tile on a concrete floor in a year old power plant the battle is like the kid with his finger in the holland dike for the uneven and with no offense to contractors plus years ago they likely used different pour support methods than used today perhaps never did screed or float before adding walls you also don't mention whether or not the flooring is uneven due to degradadtion or the initial process perhaps if you have moisture or seepage problems and the floor is wet or damp nothing you apply in the form of leveling mortars will remain intact over the long term if i was contracted to do the job i d probably suggest thinking of losing inches in height from floor to celing and install a faux sub floor other than that can i should i certainly with proper planning and prep why not if only for the aesthetics steven wolf  Animal Crossing Rose (Doctor Who) Amazon.com Care Bears Mnemonic Publishing Economy of Brazil Knife Gross domestic product Electrician Crash Test Dummies Extreme Programming Breastfeeding Do it yourself Kim Possible ISBN Minor characters in Morrowind Goosebumps Characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion Finesse Windows Vista Doctor (Doctor Who) Upholstery Burl Ives Fighting Fantasy Game Books 1986 World Series Retailer Mark Calaway Ron Weasley Insane Clown Poppy Serial Sears Holdings Corporation Binoculars The Karate Kid, Part III Home improvement The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Luck Customer relationship management Management information system Iron Maiden Walt Disney World Resort Neighbours Industrial Revolution UK Singles Chart Electronic commerce Programmable logic controller Industrial engineering Tony Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Printing press World Championship Wrestling Atreyu Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters The Wheezer Bros.

growing your own food i live near chicago area i have a large yard but i also have dogs i am hoping to eventually have a garden that will support two adults all year round i am a long way from that goal though i am just starting to plan it i can not actually till the earth so i have to use planters i am thinking about making my own out of cement blocks and putting a couple of layers of rocks and pebbles at the bottom for better drainage i don't have all the details worked out yet but my main questions are how do i start this garden what plants should i put in how do i protect the plants from winter weather and animals any other advice thank you the whole yard is fenced in but all the fences are covered by overgrown trees and shrubs from surrounding properties it's larger than most urban yards but it's not huge huge i'm not sure exactly how large and it's night right now so i can't measure it right now i'll get back to you on that there is a lot of shade because there are a lot of trees and the fences are covered with plants so it's really shady next to them it's fairly sunny in the middle of the back yard but we need that part for the dogs we can't till because we don't own the property and the owner won't let us is the area walled or fenced off from oter property how large length and width how much sun and shade and why can't you till it tell me those and i'll get right back to you edit ok thanks for the info three problems here owner's regulation on no tilling a lot of shade and very acid soil under the trees here's an approach that might work consider planting pea in theshady areas early in the spring before the trees are fully leaved i assume you are allowed to dig a hole for a plant so instead of a hole scartch up the area with a garden rake lay the peans on the ground and cover them with a mix of sand and bagged garden top soil to a level of about when they grow to or so start gradually adding some top soil to give them some support don't wory about planting them in neat straight rows just scatter them up and down the planting areas defined by the width of your rake later as they reach about put stakes along the row and tie strings between them to give the peas something to hold on to with the peas plant carrots the peas will help loosen the soil for the carrots to take hold get short fat carrots because the skinny ones just won't penetrate the soil well in the first year let them grow right in there with the peas as the the pea vines die off the carrots will come in behind them i would recommend snow peas or sugar pod peas the ones you eat pod and all aside from being fairly adaptable the peas will put nitrogen into the soil carrots actually take years to mature in the second year they put out attractive white blooms that look sort of like queen anne's lace so you can let them take the full years maybe you can put in rows instead of just around the dog area which i assume has some kind of fence of its own plant cucumber just along the outside of their fence as the vines grow train them to the fence so the cucumbers will be suspended as they grow and easy to pcik the dogs won't eat them plant just by making a hole about deep and dropping in a seed or every along the fence inside the doggies' area plant tomatoes and or peppers in pots the pots should be about deep use plants that have been started for you you can use the nice rich bagged soil and some fertilizer for these you'll need to support them as they grow either tie them to the dog fence or drive stakes in by the pots hint it is easier to use wire to tie the plants such as solid wire used for house wiring because you can bend it around plant stems and branches then use it again next year in the base of the tomatoe pots you can plant lettuce and spinach from seed after the season is over gather up the dead stems and vines break them up or shred them as much as possible and put them in a compost pile put vegetable waste peelings etc coffee grounds and broken egg shells in the pile from time to time and toss on some soil you can add some worms if you like the following year you'kll have some rich stuff and won't need to import as much it is tough to create a vegetable garden on an elevated surface or flat because you not only need adequate depth of soil but must control drainage as well if possible without getting into trouble cut away some of the tree limbs hanging over your area to let in a bit more sun good luck  Climate of the United Kingdom Diving suit Sauna Diseases of the honeybee Motor oil K__ppen climate

what is the best way to insulate around in floor heat tubing that is installed between the floor joists i have heard that there is a bubble wrap that is used to insulate around the tubing but i am having my house insulated using sprayed on expanding foam and would like to use that to insulate around the tubing any ideas using expanding foam would be a bad idea the area that is in contact between the pipe and the floor is very small and if you used foam you would get very little transfer of heat to the living area there needs to be an open area around the pipes for the heat to spread out and heat the entire floor space between the floor joists the insulation needs to be a couple of inches below the pipes for this to happen fiberglass insulation works well for this and the bubble wrap type of insulation works very good for this also it is easier to install but costs a little more  Irrigation Autonomous building Dairy Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Brewery Sears Holdings Corporation Hydrogen economy Drill bit Glossary of firefighting equipment Thermal power station Marine aquarium Koi Bong Aquarium Hamster Apollo Command/Service Module Chatsworth House Poker jargon Potomac River Solar power Goldfish Torpedo Glossary of nautical terms Fish farming Great Lakes Dundas Square Carburetor Concrete Fossil fuel power plant E85 Hard disk M16 (rifle) Floppy disk Ernest Harmon Air Force Base Geodesic dome Fountain Shotgun Hydraulic machinery Bladderwort Golf Drainage Wal-Mart Sewage treatment Panama Canal Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Lake Bass guitar Wire Petroleum Transistor Violin Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Huron River (Michigan) Punch card Fire extinguisher Elis Prefecture Zuiderzee Works Orlando, Florida Yosemite National Park Animal Crossing Christmas tree Solar panel Knife Shrimp farm Houseplant San Jose, California Naval mine Niagara Falls Energy development Renewable energy Barbed wire Refrigerator Gramophone record Canal lock Ann Arbor, Michigan Alcohol fuel Snorkel IPod Thermostat Potato Aerial (dance move) Sea-Monkey Smelt P-47 Thunderbolt Reef tank Kayak Murray River Internal ballistics Lighting B-47 Stratojet Carbon dioxide

how do i make a tie dye t shirt with multiple colors can anyone give me detailed instructions on how to make the shirts here's how choose a t shirt that is at least cotton rayon linen or hemp if you want bright colors in your tie dye design fabric mixes containing cotton and polyester don't take the dyes as well and will create pastel shades avoid polyester or nylon wash and dry your garment prior to dying to remove any commercial sizing that has been added during manufacturing the principle of tie dying is that by folding the fabric tying it with string or using rubber bands the dye cannot reach the fabric evenly creating color graduations and designs a scrunch pattern is one of the easiest techniques but is perhaps better suited for fabric than a finished garment simply crumple the t shirt into a flat disk and secure with rubber bands for circular designs grab the cloth where you want the center of the design lift the t shirt and slide a rubber band down the tube of fabric that you've just created twist rubber band several times to hold in place the length of the tube determines the size of the circle use rubber bands at intervals along this tube to create more circular designs within the larger circle to make a spiral lay the t shirt on a flat surface and smooth out any wrinkles make a small pleat where you want the center of the spiral to appear grab the center of the pleat with a clothespin and twist upwards no more than two inches higher than your working surface tie the end of your design with string and leave the clothespin in place as you dye pre soak the garment in washing soda for minutes back in the old days a bunch of friends would get together decide on the colors of the day and tie dye the afternoon away in large pots of rit fabric dye we simply mixed the dye according to directions and dyed entire items or portions of the t shirt by dipping it into the dye using metal tongs it was cheap spontaneous and a creative statement today there are a wide variety of fabric dyes available at craft stores many of which come in squeezable bottles for more exact application working on a flat surface simply spray or squirt the dye in desired areas the key to a lasting design is to keep the garment wet while the dye has a chance to react and set once you have finished dying place the garment in a sealed plastic bag for up to hours wash newly dyed items separately three times to ensure that you've removed all unactivated dye use laundry detergent and wash first in cold then warm and finally hot water wash your tie dyed t shirts separately the first few times to ensure that they are color fast before washing them with your regular wash tips wear rubber gloves when dying speaking from experience i can tell you that it takes about a week to get rid of fabric dye from your hands if you don't use gloves create designs on the front and back of your garment separately the two layers of material are too thick to create an effective design using a single rubber band or piece of string the tighter the rubber band or piece of string around the fabric the crisper the lines of your design experiment with looser tying to create softer graduations of color  A-6 Intruder Mega Man (NES) Voldo The Legend of Zelda series enemies Combine (Half-Life 2) Space Pirate (Metroid) Wing Chun Pidgeotto Hacker (computer security) American Alligator Beetle Burglar alarm VUX Luminoth Paint Computer security Spring and Autumn Period Hyuga Neji Secrecy USS William D.

what is the best way to keep a dorm room organized so that in a small space i can find everything i am looking for good question first advice is to go to www dormbuys com and look at their space savers section this site sells everything for living in dorms and they have everything you could possible think of to stay organized you definitely need to get some bed risers a rackraiser or something else to raise your bed this way you can store some extra stuff underneath you should get some closet organizers to maximize your space they make stuff for shoes shirts sweaters hats etc next buy something to go on the back or closet bedroom and bathroom doors this definitely helps you can also buy items that serve as stand alone drawers for holding food socks misc etc hope this helps  Hydrochloric acid Gilding Building material Titanium HyperText Transfer Protocol Tooth Pottery Web server Biodiesel Typewriter AdWords Brazing Cross site scripting World Wide Web AmigaOS Search engine optimization Coal Common Unix Printing System Shoe polish Web browser Google Uniform Resource Identifier Plastic Kart racing Equine conformation Soap Charles Goodyear Phosphoric acid Poker jargon Aloe Microprocessor Brush Uniform Resource Locator Textile manufacturing Wood Ebook Lionel Corporation Alchemy Mozilla Application Suite Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Punch card Car washing techniques Sulfur Drill bit Logging Stainless steel Floppy disk RuneScape quests Cascading Style Sheets Domain Name System Java programming language Fire Common bean Larry Wallis Chocolate 2000 Australian Grand Prix Piccolo Junior Saga Tin Lumber Paint Sulfuric acid Gopher protocol Hydrogen peroxide Customs and etiquette of Japan Energy development Weathering Cadillac Hemp Portland cement Trail Woodworking Iron Bulk vending Google search Printed circuit board Carnivorous plant Adamawa Province Atherosclerosis Manicure Spirit rover HTML Casting Milk The Drew Carey Show ALGOL 68 NeXT Internal ballistics Carbon nanotube Acid rain AMD BMW Mercury Atlas 6 Human skin color Slashdot subculture Web traffic Tofu Coffee

do you need planning permission to put some glass blocks into a wall to let light in do not want a window just would like to let some natural light into the room talking about glass blocks max assuming you are not within a conservation area and your property is not a listed building and you are talking about an external wall then it is unlikely you will require planning permission however you will almost definitely require building control approval form fee and plan required to be submitted before you start this may not be as straight forward as it seems as the removal of original bricks may affect the integrity of the wall as a whole it will probably require the insertion of a lintel for support above the glass blocks  Tile Masonry Reinforced concrete Seismic retrofit Asbestos Adhesive Pavement (material) Printed circuit board Epoxy Roof Stucco Casting Drill bit Dental caries Plastic Deck (ship) Linoleum Basement Carpet Wallpaper group Tessellation Paint Architecture of the California missions Friction Label Ultraviolet Mosaic Brazing Sandpaper Mahjong Glass Light-emitting diode Primer (paint) Manicure Tooth enamel Ra (board game) Solar cell Aluminium Suture Pottery Psoriasis Tai shogi Sento Light-frame construction Tooth Railway platform Circuit design Prestressed concrete Nacre Toynbee tiles Deadly Rooms of Death Screw Asphalt concrete Solar power Corrosion Electrical wiring Alkane Diamond enhancement Drywall Randomness Apple Caracas Dundas Square Plasticizer Urinary incontinence Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace Oriented strand board Metal leaf Ceramics Symmetry Shroud of Turin Taikyoku shogi Boat building San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Optical coating Galvanization Road Opportunity rover Vitreous enamel Glaze Adhesion Maka dai dai shogi King Khalid International Airport Photolithography Airsoft Skin Queensbridge Mahjong solitaire Fire fighting Gasification Reactive armour Wood Plywood Mirror Guastavino tile Paint stripper PC Engine The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past

how do i paint an outdated ordinary wooden dining room set without sanding it i want a new look without the hours of sanding note the table top is very shiny like it has extra coating of a pretective something on it as some other people have said you pretty much have to do a little sanding so the paint will be able to stick you don't have to remove all of the existing finish just roughen the surface i would use or grit sandpaper go over the surface just enough so that it doesn't have any shine left it won't take very long don't worry next and very importantly apply primer the primer is designed to stick like crazy and will enable the paint to stick to the furniture without it the paint will peel right off in no time kilz is the brand that's common around here but any latex based primer from a hardware store should do it's available in cans or spray on next paint i'd recomment a good quality semi gloss medium shine latex paint for durability also use a quality brush to avoid ending up with bristle marks that will detract from your finished project oil based would be even more durable than latex but it's much nastier and harder to work with so i'd avoid it  Domestic water system Plumbing fixture Bong Sewage treatment Basement Hydrochloric acid Thermal power station Irrigation Diving suit Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Bathroom Plastic Sewer Flush toilet Drainage Lighting Autonomous building Carburetor Motor oil Spark plug Carbon dioxide Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Casting Naval mine Seismic retrofit Siphon Haloalkane Japanese toilet Air conditioning Polyvinyl chloride Toilet humour Solar power Dairy Diving regulator Welding Lake Internal ballistics Glossary of firefighting equipment Brewery Automobile emissions control BS 1363 Fire fighting Water supply Sento Bullet E85 Roof Central heating Sulfuric acid Fossil fuel power plant Toilet Kitchen Disaster Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Coffee Aluminium Renewable energy Electrical wiring River Boy's surface Neutrino Coppersmith Hydrogen sulfide Cannabis cultivation Bathing Dam Severe weather terminology (United States) Desert Water Poker jargon Screw Climate of the United Kingdom Toilet paper Thermostat Hyperthermia Wire Heat Two-stroke cycle Iowa class battleship Tofu Land mine Tap (valve) Soldering Swimming Copper extraction Catalytic converter Incineration Effects of global warming Urinal Top-bar hive Passive solar Incandescent light bulb Geodesic dome Energy development M16 (rifle) Trapped in the Closet Deforestation Furnace

what about a musical keyboard vs an angle grinder who will win be the q i was practcing keyboard just now but my good neighbour decided to perform a fine rythmic accompianment on the cutter grinder thing as he is laying a new patio effort and can hear me playing upstairs next door it is a mix of country sounds good old rock ok who will win the angle grinder could phsically cut my keyboard in half but if i turn the w power amp i can burst his eardrums and mine any bets on who wins actually we are good mates but competetive i will give against the power tool any takers bob the daft boat if he is a professional then he will have ear muffs on and your attempt he will takes a grinder to your keyboard no ear muffs will help you if you are an all round muscian though you could use two clashing symbols to form a barrier this means he will have to change his blade to a metal cutting blade and most people take off the ear muffs as they are not the most comfortable so you could take advantage of this my money would still be on the angle grinder because even if you still manage to blow his and your ear drums he could still either go in a frenzy and cut up your machine or trip and fall with the machine in his hand over your keyboard however if anyone of you is cunning you could disrupt the power supply by pulling the plug and then counterattacking this will not work however if the machines are supplied by battery  Towel Upholstery Customs and etiquette of Japan Douglas Adams Microeconomics Menstrual cup Christmas tree Sento Dollar store Sears Holdings Corporation Inflation Basket Aldi Sauna Happy Tree Friends Berkshire Hathaway Manicure Hot air balloon Day of the Dead Supply and demand Spidey Super Stories Mixtape The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Gaia Online Sharon Tate Humphrey Bogart Tlingit Billboard Hot 100 Hamster Textile manufacturing terminology ITunes Music Store Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Paper towel Green Day Married... with Children Japanese toilet Bulk vending Celebration, Florida Monetary policy Pittsburgh Steelers Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Care Bears Do it yourself Hazing Animal Crossing Shaggy dog story Advertising U2 (band) Massage Ross Perot Apple Dairy Coffee Dry cleaning The Smoking Room Disc golf Order of the British Empire Money Theory of conduct Kitchen Birthday Filling station Book George Costanza Capital accumulation Washing machine Burning Man Characters in the Smurfs Futures contract Hat Hersheypark Marketing Renminbi NBA Finals Fishing About a Boy Bicycle lighting Hybrid vehicle Cliff Richard Elections in the United States Retailer Convenience store Super Bowl XIV Royal Warrant Fancy rat Rice cooker The Malice at The Palace Mattress Gold standard Gross domestic product Procter & Gamble Professional wrestling match types Pysanka Illegal drug trade Gay bathhouse AmigaOS UK Singles Chart Abigail Folger Preston, Minnesota Battery (electricity)

can your pour concrete over and old asphalt driveway yes but to avoid it cracking on loads it should be reinforced with mm mesh reo you should also accomodate expansion joints to avoid it cracking ashpalt is a plastic felxible material so it doesn't crack when loads are applied on it or when temp changes summer winter concrete on the other hand is more stiff so you need to consider expansion also concrete is compressive material and its not good in tension so it needs to be reinforced to enhance its properties a concrete driveway that is done properly will last a lifetime or a few note they don't lay asphalt before concrete in roads it's the opposite they lay concrete first as it is the structural more durable material then asphalt is layed over that for grip as concrete would be too slippery for cars  Seismic retrofit Light-frame construction Drywall Sento Plywood Hamster Carnivorous plant Stoma Genericized trademark Masonry Drowning Carburetor Radio controlled airplane Casting Bathing Architecture of the California missions Bathroom Roof Electrophysiology Boat building Adhesive Wood McMansion Customs and etiquette of Japan Tofu Japanese toilet Polyvinyl alcohol Tanning Paint Carbon dioxide Domestic water system Fast bowling Rum The Shining (film) Fire extinguisher Dymaxion house Concrete Tire Korean War Bonsai Indus Valley Civilization Postage stamp gum Polarizer STS-114 Nacre Taikyoku shogi Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Sydney Opera House Wallpaper group De Havilland Mosquito Pottery Space Shuttle external tank Bath Drill bit Sauna The Brady Bunch Towel Novelty (locomotive) Canoe Swimming pool Toilet Residual-current device Strake Glass Bookbinding Battery (electricity) Bedbug Archimedes Eifel Aqueduct CIE 1931 color space Dominoes Ocean thermal energy conversion Fire fighting Railway platform Toilet paper Portland cement Graph (mathematics) Mosaic Guitar Two-stroke cycle Straight edge Baptism Dairy Menstrual cup Viscosity Metrication Tai shogi Rebreather Diving Maka dai dai shogi Fecal incontinence Manifold Friends Spark plug Punt (boat) Skateboard Coriolis effect Tessellation

stud grade x lumber has splits is this okay hello building a house in georgia they are putting up the walls using x lumber however the lumber is marked 'stud' nice lumber but some of of them have splits in the wood is this okay the lumber is marked stud because that is what it is they come pre cut at so they are the correct and uniform length needed to build the wall when building a home whole bundles are sometimes shipped including some that are bowed to far have knots or defects or otherwise not usable for studs the responsible builder will cull these from the bundle and use them for shorter pieces that need to be cut end splits are common in lumber bought in bulk it doesn't compromise the strength of the stud unless the split is excessive over in longer lengths for wall plates splits are usually cut out but in studs there is no extra length to cut off  Reinforced concrete Pavement (material) Concrete Seismic retrofit Masonry Roof Road Tire Rebar Asphalt concrete Composite material Geodesic dome Aluminium Rail tracks Wood Prestressed concrete Truss Stress (physics) Motorcycle Aggregate (composite) Screw Oil refinery Fatigue (material) Truss bridge Asphalt Building material Boat building Combine (Half-Life 2) Buckling Beam (structure) Casting Suspension bridge Young's modulus Natural building Fiberglass Graphite-reinforced plastic Welding Arch bridge Upholstery Knife Equine conformation Deck (ship) Wind turbine Portland cement E85 Carbon nanotube Beretta 92F/FS Violin Ceramics Metallurgy Rope Straw-bale construction Limit state design Rear wheel drive Mattress Viva La Bam Air-raid shelter Street Balikpapan Bicycle Glossary of climbing terms Gasoline Bridge Pile Textile manufacturing terminology Retaining wall NASCAR Glass Strength of materials Urban heat island Runway Explosive material Space elevator Drill bit Ice core Tensile strength Plaster Anchor Tennis Cocaine Bolted joint Stucco Professional wrestling holds Rail terminology Golf club (equipment) Diving Data Encryption Standard Disc brake Corrosion Deformation Radio controlled airplane Badminton Dam Ridge Route Avalanche Brazing Lincoln Highway Zirconia

soundproofiing i have a room in the basement i want to put drums in and it has concrete walls i need to know how to soundproof them and the ceiling its a small room with small window and i need to do it cheap i need it so my parents wont here right above me the only way to properly create a sound isolated room studio is creating a room within a room sound waves travel through matter and travel best through dense materials so what you want to do is minimise the contact the of the inner shell with the rest of the house drums are the hardest because low frequencies travel furthest through dense material so what you need to do is build a timber structure that is freestanding inside that room have as little connections to the walls and ceilings as possible it would be too much of a hastle to raise the floor so maybe just put that aside another thing is that you can install accousitic insulation accoustic woll in the cavity that will exist between the inner room and the original room walls its very important to have you doors seal as tightly as possible you want to try to make the room as air tight and disconected from the structure of the house as possible to minimise sound waves from taveling out of your studio if the room door opens inwards have it made to open out then when you build your inner structure have its own door open inwards its very important to have two good doors as exits and vents are the most vulnerable points where sound will escape with sound isolation what you pay for is what you get trying to save a bit on it will just not do it the tiniest detail can affect it and it would be pointless a few things to take into consideration would be the internal accousitcs of the room if you can afford installing accoustic panels on the walls it would dramatically improve your studios accoustics especially if you would be recording or jamming in there if you wanna save a bit you can just have the walls carpeted or hang wooden frames with stretched fabric on them like an artists canvas that will improve the accoustics of your room it would also be best if you can seal the window or block it with particle board  Wood Light-frame construction Drill bit Seismic retrofit Poker jargon Screw Welding Stud poker Lumber Textile manufacturing Rigging Timber framing Equine conformation Straw-bale construction Building material Sail-plan Bass guitar Katana Ship Plane (tool) Archery Upholstery Platform framing Floppy disk Panama Canal Passenger car Betting (poker) Dinghy Golf Violin Imperial stormtrooper CPU cache Log cabin Glossary of climbing terms English longbow Stave church Earring Cheating in poker Artillery Bolted joint Zuiderzee Works Bicycle frame Saw Piano Tally sticks Campfire Masonry Einstein-Cartan theory Movie projector Appalachian Mountains Tank landing ship Extreme Programming Casting Optical fiber Rise of Nations Age of Empires Galveston Hurricane of 1900 Universal Century Technology Type VII U-boat Flax Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Rope Construction Nicomachean Ethics Interstate Highway Double bass Rail terminology Atrial septal defect Knot GunBound Mouse (computing) HMS Ramillies (07) Sword Hadrian's Wall Democratic Party (United States) Liberal Party (UK) Sawmill Stairway Woodworking Passive solar Architecture of the California missions RuneScape quests Chopsticks Glossary of nautical terms Geology of the Appalachians Diamond Draw poker Babylonian law Money Radio controlled airplane Hebrew calendar Economic history of Canada Bassoon Wood carving Morse Code Glossary of American football Solar power Carbon nanotube Homebuilt aircraft Age of Mythology

how do i make a pillow i have stuffing and fabric but i don't know how to make one thanks it is a good idea to get some plain cotton or muslin and make the pillow out of that then make a removable cover out of your fancy fabric so that the cover can be removed and cleaned you don't want to do all this work and not have your pillow stay looking nice cut the fabric into two matching squares rectangles circles whatever the size you want the pillow to be when you stuff the pillow it will draw up and seem smaller so you might want to add an inch or so all around plus room for the seam allowance sew the muslin or cotton square around all four corners leaving a hole about the size of your hand so you can put the stuffing in turn the sewn square right side out and stuff the stuffing in until it is as plumpy as you want it to be sew the stuffing hole shut it's easiest to do this closing sewing by hand now sew up your cover fabric leave one side open and install a zipper so you can remove the cover for cleaning if you can't cope with a zipper you can put buttons and button loops or button holes to close the cover or install ribbon ties or you can make the cover big enough so that you can just fold it back on the pillow you can also look in the pattern books at fabric stores they have home decorator patterns in them and you could buy a pattern for the type and size of pillow you want the pattern will provide a cutting template and very detailed instructions  Loudspeaker Wood Fire fighting Seismic retrofit Basement Xanadu House Door Drill bit Window Vacuum Carpet Timber framing Insulation Electrical wiring Straw-bale construction Kitchen Asbestos Glossary of firefighting terms Bullet Casting Autonomous building Diode Diving suit Sento Wilton House Thermal power station Shotgun house Light-frame construction Solar cell Seismometer White House TARDIS The Time Machine Fan (implement) Combine (Half-Life 2) Solar power Dundas Square Speed of light McMansion Equine conformation Tent Transformer Spark plug Rathfarnham Lighting HVAC Volleyball Sound effect Frankfurt kitchen Wind turbine Geodesic dome Particle accelerator Le Corbusier StarCraft: Uprising Radar Violin Blood (computer game) Building material Cube (film) Poker jargon Jet engine G-Man (Half-Life) Sound Michelson-Morley experiment The Parting of the Ways St Albans Cathedral Construction Stonehenge Upholstery Chatsworth House Echo chamber Stairway The Shining (film) TGV Gramophone record Super Metroid Wood carving Abbey Microphone Buckingham Palace Integrated circuit The Phantom Manor Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Masonry Tudorbethan architecture Oscilloscope Bladderwort Natural Selection (computer game) Radio masts and towers Knife Temporal bone

how do i cut an outlet opening in a x ceramic floor tile this is what i would do assuming you have a wet tile saw get your measurements transfer those over and mark the outlet out on the back side of the tile by cutting the back side you wont go past your measurements on the front eventually you can just pop the piece out and chip away at the corners with some tile nippers sold at your local hardware store be patient make sure to mark out the outlet on both front and back i'd use a sharpie or a tile pencil which can be found at your hardware store keep checking the front side of theh tile to make sure that you're not going outside of the lines as you cut but a carbide bit in a roto zip would be very effective  Upholstery Mattress Textile manufacturing terminology Textile manufacturing Clothing Kimono Knitting Drill bit Sewing Carpet Poker jargon Pillow Undergarment Bookbinding Floppy disk Pattern (sewing) Betting (poker) Hat Casting Knife Weaving Tofu Chair Glossary of nautical terms Stocking Aerial (dance move) Wood carving Autopsy Fischer Random Chess Zipper Shoe Violin Parachute Tire Shroud of Turin Loudspeaker Bong Shoelaces Japanese tea ceremony Comanche Wire Trousers Metalworking Cross-stitch Screw Colours, standards and guidons Skirt and dress Solar cell Brassiere Glossary of climbing terms Bread Hamster RISC Professional wrestling match types Hangi Chess strategy and tactics Dog agility Thermal power station Glossary of partner dance terms Punch card Diving suit GunBound Japanese toilet EastEnders Diving regulator Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Lava Wallpaper group Barbed wire Swingout Apollo Command/Service Module CPU cache AmigaOS Tatting My Little Pony Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Gramophone record Movie projector Bedbug Antenna (radio) Tallit Woodworking Kasparov versus The World Nintendo GameCube Shotgun Repouss__ and chasing Wound Snooker Two-stroke cycle Table tennis

any tips for assembling ikea stuff i love the prices i am so so on the quality but i can benefit from a cheap bookshelf the catch is when i take something home even after reading the directions it always looks terrible any tips you guys may have to make my ikea furniture look sturdy what kind of item regardless one step at a time usually works best if you bought a wood unit usually made with mdf now by some wood glue and when assembling the unit use the glue on the joints make sure you plan it out and take your time because you need to have pressure applied on the joint and allow time for the glue to dry i do this because most of their stuff is poor quality and will come loose over time the glue adds some rigidity to the unit so the unit is stronger and less likely to come apart or loosen with use  Air conditioning Mattress Thermal power station Solar power Polystyrene Glossary of firefighting terms Spark plug Hot air balloon Foam Refrigerator IPod STS-114 Coffee Fire fighting Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Rail terminology Water (molecule) Hard disk Casting Circuit breaker The Star Wars Holiday Special Airbag Tire Brewery Volleyball Screw HVAC Microphone BS 1363 Diving suit Lost-foam casting Glossary of firefighting equipment Paragliding MAME Upholstery Floppy disk Printed circuit board Poker jargon Hyperthermia Motor oil Dodge Charger Dairy GunZ The Duel Water vapor Ocean thermal energy conversion Thermoregulation Fossil fuel power plant Capacitor Diving regulator Motorcycle Strap-on dildo Mercury 4 Thermostat Window Ice Transformer Furnace Fuse (electrical) System/36 Sega Saturn Coaxial cable Lightning Space Shuttle program Virtual memory Fume hood Common cold Carbon dioxide IBM PC compatible Iowa class battleship Circuit design Xanadu House Solar cell Reading spark plugs for racing Mercury Atlas 6 Origin of life Nuclear weapon design Vacuum tube B-47 Stratojet Windows XP Mummy Rugby union positions Loudspeaker Visual Basic Swamp cooler Terran (StarCraft) Straw-bale construction Lighting Fog Heinkel He 100 Drill bit Vacuum Internal combustion engine Langstroth hive Sand casting Jet engine

how do i remove an old deck hello we recently started ripping out an old deck that was in our backyard it was rotting and falling apart and so we ripped off the top layer of wood well whoever installed it did a crazy good job there are huge bolts like they use on street lights holding these huge boards together on top of that they cemented posts into the ground not being the world's best at working in the yard should i hire someone to complete the removal if so how much will it cost if you think i can do it by myself where do i start thanks so much it will be hard work to do it yourself you can use a reciprocating saw with a metal blade to cut the bolts having a few metal blades is a good idea as they might break or wear out wear eye protection and gardening gloves for safety maybe a face shield too using saw horses or some other form of support would be a good idea to support the boards when cutting them so they won't move in an unpredictable manner and possibly injure someone be careful and take your time safety first for the cemented posts you can dig around them to loosen them out of the ground using a tractor or a couple people with some strong rope or chain you should be able to pull the posts and cement out in one piece to dispose of the decking i would burn it if it was allowed if that isn't possible you can rent a garbage bin and throw it away there might be a place associated with your local dump where you can take wood waste you could haul it out yourself or hire a guy with a truck to take it away for you to make it more portable you might need to take the reciprocating saw with a wood blade to the boards to make them more manageable in length i think you can probably do it the most important things are to make sure you do everything as safely as possible and that you take your time  Construction Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Home improvement Solar power The Brady Bunch Coalition Provisional Authority Table saw Work of the United States Government Oil-for-Food Programme Elevator Fred A.

any good ideas for making a 'bench' out of a chaise lounge chair so i have a chaise lounge that isn't good for whats its supposed to be used for and i was going to throw it away but then thought if i laid it flat the head part and put on a long cushion it could make a great bench or because its long perhaps couch would be a better word so what i'm asking for is some suggestions for the back of the couch thanks how about a headboard for the back of the bench depending on how long the chaise is a queen or king headboard might work all you would need to do is get some screws the headboard should already have holes where it would normally be attatched to the bed frame just screw the headboard into the legs or frame of the chaise add lots of throw pillows and there ya go instant couch good luck  Lyonel Feininger Sinn F__in Benny Fein Belfast West (UK Parliament constituency) Mid Ulster (UK Parliament constituency) West Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency) Republican Sinn F__in Provisional Sinn F__in South Down (UK Parliament constituency) Belfast North (UK Parliament constituency) Irish Republicanism Democratic Unionist Party Labor slugger war Mark Durkan Upper Bann (UK Parliament constituency) IRA Army Council Armagh George Burns Waxey Gordon Official Sinn F__in European Parliament election, 2004 (UK) Gerry Adams Galway Jacob Orgen Home Rule Act 1914 William Gillies Green Party (Ireland) Alone in the Dark (series) Hawaiian sovereignty movement History of Northern Ireland Steve Lawrence Antrim Borough Council Nancy Witcher Astor Derry City Council Drill Beyond Shadows Provisional Irish Republican Army Winsor McCay East Londonderry (UK Parliament constituency) North Antrim (UK Parliament constituency) South Antrim (UK Parliament constituency) Londonderry (UK Parliament constituency) Greater London Council Belfast South (UK Parliament constituency) Irish National Liberation Army United Kingdom general election, 2005 Bauhaus Terence MacSwiney Armagh (UK Parliament constituency) Acad__mie Colarossi Rip Taylor Radio Telef__s __ireann North Down (UK Parliament constituency) Sean MacDermott Belfast Treaty of Nice Irish Republic Scottish independence Anti-Semitism Nathan Kaplan William O'Brien Northern Ireland Pok__mon Colosseum Monty Python's Flying Circus Republic of Ireland Parliament Building of Northern Ireland The Lumberjack Song The Comics Journal Socialist Workers Party (Ireland) Red Hand Defenders Kenneth Bigley Northern Bank robbery Southern Accents Thomas Mac Curtain Politics of Ecuador Michael McKevitt Billy Bulger Ephraim Eitam Apology Resolution Alasdair Milne South Antrim by-election, 2000 Antrim (town) Robert McCartney (murder victim) Victoria of the United Kingdom Endless Nights United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America __r nDra__ocht F__in Seamus Costello Ian Paisley 20th century Socialist Workers Party (UK) Media in Ireland Harold Bloom Response to the 2005 London bombings Sidney Hillman Tripartite System Irish nationality law February 15, 2003 global anti-war protest Supporting Characters (Xenogears)

removable flow restrictor what is that i'm shopping for showerheads i like the rainfall shower heads i found one i like but it says it comes with a removable flow restrictor does that mean i can adjust the water pressure this would be great since i like less pressure and my husband likes more for years now showerheads have been required to discharge only gallons of water a minute not much water but it is enough anyway in most showerheads it's a small round disk with a tiny hole in the center and is removable it should increase your pressure when you do i find it interesting they 'advertise' that it is removable because it is required to be in the head they make a flow valve you can put on the shower arm that your showerhead screws on to that is what you really need they don't cost much wholesale but i've never really looked at a good hardware plumbing store for one they are about bucks wholesale so expect to pay or so for it  Chair Upholstery Mattress Couch Vise (tool) Royal Assent Equine conformation Furniture Snooker Wood carving Professional wrestling throws Kowloon Motor Bus Palace of Westminster Passenger car Drill bit Theory of conduct Lisa's First Word Screw Pickup truck Teen Girl Squad Friends Lathe Strap-on dildo Bed (furniture) Socrate Cushion The Brady Bunch Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling holds Special relativity Thai royal and noble titles EastEnders The Shining (film) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Cleveland Browns Pillow Seismic retrofit Pittsburgh Steelers Sun Wukong Guilty Gear Futon Kach and Kahane Chai Piccolo Junior Saga Professional wrestling match types Disney's Contemporary Resort Billiards Headboard (band) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Vibes Shawn Michaels Rail tracks Micrometer Clinker (boat building) Cello Tire Poker jargon 1957 World Series Textile manufacturing Ontological argument Brewery President (game) The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular Dog training Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles The Lion King Einstein-Cartan theory Humphrey Bogart The dozens Charles Eames Human position Post office Luminiferous aether Baseball Happy Tree Friends Wan Chai High Court of Justice of England and Wales Milton H.

how do i angle a fence my back yard is not square i have a degree angle most places you don't have to permits for putting up a fence with this in mind you do have to follow property lines you didn't say what type of fence so i'll assume wood since your doing it and worried about the corner take your circular saw and simply cut an angle on your post from top down to ground level or you can simply make angle notches where the runner boards will fasten your choice and your time as the latter one would be quicker but you have to be more precise on your cuts if your installing one of those easy to do confounded plastic fences they are not as easy as sounds where you buy it will either carry or be able to give you the information on ordering what they call angle wedges  Brewery Drill bit Irrigation Carburetor Hard disk Diving regulator Bong Dialysis Urinal Hydraulic machinery Glossary of firefighting equipment Two-stroke cycle Three Mile Island Scuba set Flush toilet Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Plumbing fixture Equine conformation Floppy disk Rebreather Siphon Sewage treatment Glossary of firefighting terms E85 Floodgate IPod Fossil fuel power plant Gas compressor Propeller Black hole Electrophysiology Fire Sprinkler Gold standard Tire Dairy Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Diamond Thermostat Infusion pump Poker jargon Nuclear power Iowa class battleship Autonomous building Spark plug Coriolis effect Turbocharger Vacuum tube Internal ballistics Fuel injection Space shuttle main engine Diving cylinder Pelton wheel Panama Canal Diving suit Hemorrhoid Bulk vending Mattress Fountain Four-stroke cycle Ammunition Tier One Screw Intracranial pressure Gasoline Hypertension Tap (valve) Wal-Mart Thermal power station Barton Springs Water purification Pump Wrench M16 (rifle) Manifold vacuum Carbon dioxide Inventory Tax Dishwasher Windows XP Microeconomics 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Circuit breaker Aquifer test Filling station Dodge Neon Coffee Portable stove Fountain pen Diode Pressurized water reactor Urinary incontinence Fire fighting Inflation NASCAR USB flash drive Handloading Hydrogen economy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Windows 2000

is there a maximum of openings allowed in a shear wall we have a ft wall we want to put ft sliders in we are doing the work ourselves but can use any info on codes extra straps etc thanks i'm fairly certain that it can be done but it may require special anchor bolts http www strongtie com ftp catalogs c c p p pdf and shear panels like simpson strong tie's strong walls http www strongtie com ftp catalogs c c p p pdf obviously these would be easier to incorporate in new construction than a retrofit either way your local building official would most likely require a building permit which in turn means you'd need a set of plans although you could prepare the plans yourself the building official may also ask to see the calculations this is more likely if your project is two stories or more and is located near a fault zone bottom line first talk to your local building official they can tell you which codes they observe and whether a structural engineer should be consulted in your situation as long as you treat the building official as part of the team and not as an adversary they are usually willing to advise the do it yourselfer speaking of codes there is a trend by communities towards the adoption of the international residential code for which the edition is the most current the irc covers all aspects of residential construction including electrical and plumbing and can be purchased for about http www amazon com international residential code softcover dp ref pd bbs sr ie utf s books qid sr however your community may be observing one of the earlier codes like the icbo uniform building code best to find out before you place your order  Table saw Softball Knife Stairway Barbed wire Skateboarding trick Golf Poker jargon Slide rule Drill bit Surveillance Baseball Equine conformation Microphone Archery Volleyball Mattress Golf club (equipment) Fast bowling Eskrima Katana Textile manufacturing Polarization Sundial Radio controlled airplane Glossary of climbing terms Violin Field hockey Radar Glossary of American football Natural deduction Bicycle frame Saw Snooker Long Path Diamond cut Angle Fire fighting RuneScape quests Wire Lawn mower Rail tracks Billiards Woodworking Wind turbine Miter saw Tag Kitesurfing Stave church Fencing Wallpaper group Scuba set Skateboard Parallax View camera Sawfiler Manual transmission Trigonometric function Bamboo Axe Circle Boat building Agricultural fencing Clinker (boat building) Time Out of Mind Wrigley Field Professional wrestling throws Combat Mission (computer game series) Resident Evil (video game) Amateur telescope making Paragliding VHF omnidirectional range Wheel of Fortune Wood TGV Geodesic dome Trail blazing Baseball field Flute Wood router Glossary of firefighting equipment Trench warfare Taikyoku shogi Campfire Clifford algebra Air navigation Tai shogi 2004 World Series Gramophone record Seismic retrofit Car handling American football strategy Faster-than-light Timber framing Punch card Swept wing Battles of Lexington and Concord

adhesive screw head remover hi i'm trying to remove a small mm diameter philips head screw from a cell phone i'm trying to re house i remember hearing a few years ago about a material that acts like a glue between a screw driver and a screw something along the lines of putting a bit of this adhesive stuff on the head of the screw putting the screw driver in this stuff and an amount of time later the screw driver is stuck to the screw head and you're able to unscrew the screw easily enough anyone know if this stuff is real or if so what's it called or would any metal to metal super glue do the same job thanks for the help don't use gorilla glue as it sort of expands as it dries and will glue your screwdriver to the phone as well just try the super glue  Lumber Plane (tool) Drill bit Betting (poker) Screw Woodworking Poker jargon Logging Saw Rigging Portsmouth Block Mills Sawmill Violin Skateboard Montana Dimension George W.

refinishing floors i've just moved into an old farmhouse where the carpet is older than dirt i lifted a piece of the carpet and saw that there is some type of adhesive it's black so it must be ancient under the adhesive there is solid wood floor i'd like to remove the adhesive and refinish the floor shall i sand off the adhesive or is there a chemical i can use to make the removal process less time consuming thanks in advance i would refinish the floors in this sequence remove nasty carpet and underlay using a clean flat shovel paint scraper or razor blade tool gently scrape all the mess off the wood that you can vacuum the floor well rent a rotary sander looks like a commercial floor polisher from the rental store and buy some sanding pads you might need a few of each grit start with a coarse sanding pad because the adhesive will be coming off on it it will get full of material more quickly than it should changing it will help you do a nice job use progressively finer sanding pads until you have the floor smooth as a baby's bottom sand parts that the rotary sander can't reach by hand vacuum floor very well very important seal the wood with your choice of stain or sealer following the directions on the package by using the rotary sander you will be able to do a fairly fast job my father and i stripped the main floor of our house in a day and our sq ft cement floor back room in one day also it isn't hard just dusty please do yourself a favor and wear a mask otherwise you will have green black material coming out when you blow your nose for a day or two afterwards  Adhesive Drill bit Tire Clinker (boat building) Genericized trademark Violin Screwdriver Professional wrestling throws Modem Timpani Hamster Bong Floppy disk Motor oil Electrophysiology Seismic retrofit Spidey Super Stories Radio controlled airplane Aluminium Textile manufacturing Vise (tool) The Inside Loudspeaker Guitar Carburetor Items in the Metroid series Upholstery Woodworking BS 1363 Drill Wrench Printed circuit board Internal ballistics Piledriver (professional wrestling) Drywall Manifold Wonderland (McFly album) Billboard (advertising) Professional wrestling match types Survivor (novel) Dislocation Harmonica Suture Gramophone record Boat building Gag (BDSM) Cello Cyanoacrylate Sandpaper Adhesion Shaggy dog story Staple (fastener) Hand grenade Surveillance You Don't Know Jack Cartridge (firearms) Bicycle frame Die (manufacturing) Propeller Piccolo Junior Saga Plaster Zippo Suppressor Mnemonic Space opera in Scientology doctrine Sin City Piezoelectricity Plywood Drag racing Roswell UFO incident Time Out of Mind Motility Stucco Flash memory Wire wrap Knife Vegeta Friction Bone fracture Ammunition Plastic Metalworking Oxyacetylene Inhalant Snooker Crystallographic defect Letterpress printing Casting Bulk vending Label Straw-bale construction Cell adhesion Hair Incandescent light bulb Battlebots Lighting Cocaine

how doi adjust the water level of a toilet yes you can put a brick in the tank but that us not the correct way and it will discolour the water too the correct way is to if your toilet tank has a ball floating on a rod you can adjust the level by bending the rod so that the ball at the end is lower down this ball floats and as it rises to the top of the tank it shuts off the valve so the lower it is or higher it is adjusts how much water is in the tank some of the newer toilets have a plastic cup that moves up a plastic rod and when this reaches a certain point it shuts off the water valve move this cup or down to adjust the level hope this answers your question  Woodworking Upholstery Drill bit Mattress Knife Casting Plastic Carpet Friction Pottery Textile manufacturing Anchor Brewery Violin Sewage treatment Epoxy Seismic retrofit Vacuum cleaner Printed circuit board Helicopter Hamster Radio controlled airplane Thermal power station Vacuum Bong Soldering Ultraviolet Sharpening stone Chair Basement Shoe Japanese tea ceremony Glacier Animal Crossing Table saw Volleyball Tile Soap Polyurethane Genericized trademark Urinary incontinence Fan (implement) Steel Dairy Toyota Prius Plywood Mouse (computing) Stairway Lawn mower Lathe Diving Bassoon Amateur telescope making Textile manufacturing terminology Screw Leather Fast bowling Fancy rat Tire Hard disk Transformer Welding Movie projector Olduwan Coffee Culture of Korea Computer Plane (tool) 1957 World Series Wood carving Diving suit Explosive material Chopsticks Opportunity rover Aerial (dance move) Drawing Roomba Professional wrestling slang Shroud of Turin Manicure Rolling-element bearing Fossil fuel power plant Gramophone record Eolian Impact crater Ice resurfacer Bernie Sanders M16 (rifle) The Inside Shaggy dog story

squeak in flooring i purchased a fairly new manufactured home am noticing that the floor squeeks around the kitchen area what are my options thanks probably where it squeeks is at the edge of a piece of the plywood in the sub floor it may be that one of the nails that holds it in place has worked its way a little loose and the squeek is the wood moving a little as you step put weight on that part of the floor if your flooring carpet tile etc can be pulled up you might can stop the squeek by securing that section of the plywood sub floor you might want to use wood screws instead of nails when the sub floor is tight so that it no longer has any room to give move when weight is put on it then your squeek will probably stop if you cannot pull up the flooring without destroying it you might want to just keep this in mind for a future project when the flooring is replaced updated this is assuming that there is no sign of other damage that needs more immediate attention rot termites water damage etc  Mattress Real estate broker Mortgage Air New Zealand Bad Wolf Screen Actors Guild Structural engineering Seismic retrofit Wood Atari 8-bit family Oscilloscope Amiga Best Buy Real estate appraisal BC Ferries Wal-Mart IPod The Invisibles Mutual fund Craps Oil-for-Food Programme FairTax Video game crash of 1983 Space Shuttle program IBM PC compatible Dodge Neon San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Ashton-Tate Lost City (Stargate SG-1) Douglas DC-8 Lighting Dennis Kucinich XERF Virtual memory De Lorean DMC-12 Heinkel He 112 History of Adelaide Elevator Bending Battle of the beams Poker jargon Downing Street memo Citigroup Option Intellivision Bulk vending Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Animal Crossing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) RX-78 mobile suit series Crane (machine) Wayne Corporation Great Depression Sony American Motors Eurofighter Typhoon Nintendo Entertainment System Tractor Characters of Lost Microeconomics Hubert H.

how do you keep a small room with no air conditioner fresh my room is a small room but it has no aircoditioner and it usually feels damp and yucky how can i keep it smelling fresh first step would be to get a dehumidifier damp and yucky mildew mold and lots of germs you could get sick if you can't afford one of those i'm not sure how much they run try putting bowls of salt around i know that salt will absorb moisture from the air also you might try putting out some rice i know it might look odd but i'm trying to offer you some cheap alternatives that are going to fix the underlying problem with it not smelling fresh air fresheners may just make it more damp using a fan to cool the room even a little can help freshen it some since cool air holds less moisture therefore there is less chance for mold bacteria and viruses to grow don't leave dirty clothes in your room they can increase the chance that mold will grow if your room is damp also open your window airing out the room can go a long way towards refreshing it also turning the fan so that it blows out of the window will help to blow out the damp musty air and hasten the process also i have seen in a store in my town called central market a product that they sell that is a lamp made from a large piece of rock salt so if you do put out the bowls of salt maybe rock salt will work better and you should probably figure out a way to heat it a little bit maybe nestle a candle in the middle of it anyway what it does is the light inside of it helps the salt to stay even drier and attract all of the excess moisture in the air and it cleans the air and does all kinds of other neat things i'll include the link it should be the last one down there anyway good luck  Inkjet printer Computer printer Plastic Textile manufacturing terminology Drawing Konica Minolta Craps PostScript Upholstery Printing press Digital photography Printmaking T-shirt Mattress Undergarment TeX David Beckham Common Unix Printing System Desk Book Monopoly (game) ASCII art Dot matrix printer Photographic film Mac OS X Bookbinding Ironing Typewriter Paper size Typeface Floppy disk Windows XP Offset printing Open access Solar cell Integrated circuit Commodore 64 Digital camera Universal Serial Bus Printed circuit board Dots per inch RISC Surrealist techniques CPU design Gucci Shirt Textile manufacturing Xerox ZX Spectrum Education in the United States Photography 2D computer graphics HTML Animal Crossing IPod Mars Exploration Rover Outsourcing Polyester Opera (web browser) Mario Postage stamp Bluetooth Redundant array of independent disks Carl Barks Chester Carlson Photocopying Webcomic Linen Editor IBM PC compatible Control character Clothing Staples, Inc.

how much would it cost to build a double size bed will i save alot of money than buying the bed set assuming you're building it out of wood you could create one of x timber for pretty cheap pieces of wood will run between in most parts of the us it won't be fancy unless you invest in a router and some other power tools again tools are pricey if you don't have the basics consider that as a cost factor your time is money so how much do value do you put on the hours it will take to shop prep and assemble the bed today you can buy a bed frame for mattress box to sit on for it won't have a headboard but a headboard is always optional buying used is always a economical option  Hard disk Dishwasher Washing machine Fecal incontinence Thermal power station Chemical reaction Hard water Certified Nursing Assistant Cookware and bakeware Callus Dam Turbocharger Energy development Synthetic diamond Pottery Jet engine Embedded system Novelty (locomotive) Pebble bed reactor Stirling engine Metamorphic rock Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mattress Aerodynamics Snorkel Menstrual cup John Dalton Siphon Spacecraft propulsion Siegfried Line Tire Chemical formula Compound locomotive Hydropneumatic Japanese toilet Textile manufacturing Temple (Mormonism) Hydrogen economy Protein sequencing Linux Industrial wastewater treatment Chevrolet Corvair Iran and weapons of mass destruction Appliance Cheese Fire extinguisher Clothing Bookbinding Internal combustion engine Sense Bleeding Ice Electrophysiology The 64,000 Dollar Question Water purification Supercharger Electric motor USB flash drive 2003 North America blackout Wound New York Giants Transmission (mechanics) Fossil fuel power plant Osmosis Galveston Hurricane of 1900 Sauna Igneous rock Stomach cancer Cadillac Eldorado Expert system Sailing Jute Psoriasis Brush Vauxhall Viva Common cold Stairway Triumph Dolomite Personal computer Fountain Irrigation Diabetic retinopathy Methanol Car handling Tank Fire fighting Game controller Ford Crown Victoria Mooney M20 Fossil Tungsten RuneScape cheats Ernie Irvan Asbestos Torpedo Passover Land Rover (Series/Defender) Antibiotic resistance London Bridge is Falling Down

how do you lay flagstone we just put in a pool and we were wondering how to lay flagstone around it does anyone know it depends on the kind of stone and the surface you are installing it over if you are installing flagstone into the natural scape like dirt or grass you can dig out a small amount under the stone and place it in gradually the stone will settle in to a natural depth as you walk on it just be sure to keep it maintained by sweeping and pulling weeds around it this application will create what looks like stepping stones wherever you install it if you are installing over a hard surface like concrete you would probably want to fill the entire area so it looks like the entire ground in that area is flagstone if you do that you will have to use a thick mortar bed because the bottom of the flagstone will not be flat use a spec mix or quikcrete and spread it generously in your area lay the flagstone down with as little room as possible between each stone try about of an inch if you can before it dries clean the mortar from between the flagstone leaving a noticeable joint after the stone has dried at least hours pick a grout color and install that in between each stone  Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Residual-current device Fuse (electrical) BS 1363 Incandescent light bulb Ground and neutral Alternating current Electrical wiring Distribution board Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Transformer Light switch Electrical wiring (UK) Mercury-vapor lamp Fluorescent lamp National Electrical Code (US) Kitchen Universal Serial Bus Railway signal X10 (industry standard) Street light Enigma machine Spark plug Ring circuit Fireworks Ethernet Lawn mower Wire wrap Circuit design Aluminium Thermal power station Earthing system Dimmer Internet fraud Thermostat Power strip Hand grenade Overhead lines Split phase Buckingham Palace Cliff Richard Seismic retrofit Common electrical adaptors in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom Washroom 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines The Star Wars Holiday Special Family Guy Electrical generator Chandelier Ground (electricity) Three-phase electric power Electricity meter Lineman (occupation) Jack plug Electric motor Episodes of Lost (Season 1) STS-61 Telephone exchange Yoko Ono Surveillance CPU cache World Trade Center bombing Naval mine Sin City Rail terminology Tire Switch Seismometer Suicide methods Modem Light pollution Stage lighting Light rail Computer bus The Matrix Revolutions Relay First day on the Somme Key telephone system Vacuum tube Electrician Railway signalling Love Hina main characters Headlight Fan (implement) Sound recording Telephone switchboard Mains electricity Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Solar power Circuit breaker Automotive lighting War of Currents Mattress George Westinghouse Laptop Piccolo Junior Saga Boom Town (Doctor Who) Care Bears Elevator

how do you make distilled water at home without fancy equipment quick and easy if i just have to boil it how many times no no no boiling water does not distil it it potentially sterilises it but does not distil it after boiling the water will have an even higher proportion of disolved minerals etc in it than before boil it and then condense the steam on a cold surface and collect the water that runs off that is distilled water a slower way also used as a survival technique for getting clean water from sea water or other undrinkable source even urine get two bottles idealy one transparent fill the transparent one with water then join the two together at the neck then position them so that the one with water in it is in the sun so it heats up and the other kept cool in the shade or covered and angled so that water will collect in the bottom the heat causes evaporation of water in the filled bottle which then condenses in the cooler bottle and collects as distilled water in the bottom of the bottle  Drill bit Anchor Seismic retrofit Japanese tea ceremony Textile manufacturing Masonry Tillage Irrigation Casting Flax Equine conformation Drainage Sewage treatment Opportunity rover Naval mine Knife Solar cell Brewery Wood Drowning Eifel Aqueduct Weed control Diamond cut Thermal power station Desert Tuff Roman road Orkney Islands Pile Sundial Death Valley National Park Oak Island Bong Pottery Sento Yosemite National Park Poker jargon Basement Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Diving suit Great Pyramid of Giza Gas metal arc welding Diamond Geography of Bolivia Pavement (material) Illegal drug trade Lighting Mortar (masonry) Paint Blood (computer game) A151 road Architecture of the California missions Upholstery Avebury Skateboarding trick Diving Hamster Sugar beet Lake District 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Stereoscopy Edwards Air Force Base Hard disk Flood geology Manifold Tofu Glass Plaster Lemmings 2: The Tribes Battle of Iwo Jima Aerial (dance move) Geology of the Grand Canyon area Fast bowling Plane (tool) Printmaking Aggregate (composite) Building material Solar power Drywall Lawn Capercaillie Plough Gobi Desert Rail tracks Sidewalk Chaco Culture National Historical Park Swimming pool Chatsworth House Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Wind turbine Fancy rat Strap-on dildo Lechaina Amateur telescope making Fallout shelter

why do the lines on my centeral air unit keep icing up out side its not a leak there are probably a few things wrong the system could be low on freon but that's not always the case it could also b that your evaporation coils on the top of you furnace are clogged with dust and dander this happens a lot if you are mechanically inclined at all you can take the front panel of the evap coils and get in there with a garden sprayer with a mixture of simple green and water it should wash off careful though you don't want to damage the fins looks like a radiator and if the lines out side are freezing these will also be frozen after you clean those coils go ahead and use the same spry on the condensing coils they are the ones out side around the ac unit then run the system if it still freezes you will need to have the freon checked by a professional but they wont be charging you for all the coil washes cause they have already been done it good preventative maintenance and if its never been done you'll find quite a mess up there hope this helps  Distillation Brewery Water Heat exchanger Solar power Bong Water vapor Water (molecule) Water purification Fractional distillation Coffee Autonomous building Agar plate Ocean thermal energy conversion Steam engine Lake Boiling point Helium Alkane Thermal power station Motor oil Fossil fuel power plant Marine aquarium Hydrogen Single malt Scotch Desert Petroleum Furnace Fog Glass Hyperthermia Rum Reflux Perfume Temperature Welding Moonshine Cider Dry cleaning Sulfuric acid Steam Alcoholic beverage Soldering Evaporation Plastic Food preservation Carbon Nuclear reactor Diamond Hydrogen peroxide Thermoregulation Alcohol fuel Desalination Renewable energy Autoclave Hydrogen economy Casting Tesla coil Industrial process Vacuum Scotch whisky Dundas Square Phase change heat pump Carburetor Urine Sea ice Sun Homebrewing Tea Titanium Water resources First aid Geyser Diving suit Sterilization (microbiology) Ammonia Printed circuit board Greenhouse effect Hong Kong-style milk tea Alcohol Microwave oven Heat Tofu Essential oil Mars Phase (matter) Gas tungsten arc welding Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Space habitat Cocaine Solvent Nitrogen Explosive material Phosphorus Soap bubble Distilled beverage

how long do you have to wait to 'seal' a block paved drive and how long does it take to dry how much is the sealant to buy and if you know of any good makes to buy would also be of help also any advice on how this should be done thanks sealants should not be applied to any pavement that is less than months old and not before all traces of effloresence have disappeared there's no point paying good money to seal in the effloresence recent research suggests that sealing could take place as soon as weeks after laying if the paving is treated to remove all calcium carbonate from the surface is allowed to thoroughly dry and then sealed with a low viscosity moisture cured cross linking pre polymer a polyurethane sealant to me and thee power washing is recommended before applying the sealant although this should be done at least days before sealing to enable the bedding layer and sub base to dry and allow for any reactive effloresence to appear and the lance must be kept at a shallow angle to minimise loss of jointing sand prior to any sealing the pavement should be thoroughly inspected for minor faults and to ensure the jointing is complete ie there is no jointing sand missing from the joints make sure there is no chance of rain over the next hours and that the pavement is completely dry by raking out a couple of joints and checking the jointing sand mm or mm deep if that's dry the whole pavement can be considered dry  Knife Saw Equine conformation Canoe Fencing Floppy disk Sport rowing Butterfly stroke Backstroke Batting (cricket) Wind turbine Table tennis Katana Blade Front crawl Professional wrestling throws Table saw Horizontal bar Golf Woodworking Aerial (dance move) Violin Shaper Global Gillette Professional wrestling holds Figure skating Breaststroke Drill bit Kris Textile manufacturing Helicopter PlayStation 3 The Strokes Snooker Welding Razor Diving Backsaw Internal ballistics Naval mine Golf club (equipment) Lightsaber Staple (fastener) Lawn mower Fabrication (metal) Ninja Supply and demand Dog training Perl Universal Century Technology Punt (boat) Shaving Twisted Sister Sword Pottery Lathe Boat building Yari Microeconomics Casting Frogman Bong Strap-on dildo Time Out of Mind Leaf Radio controlled airplane Sword making Swingout Mouse (computing) Bowie knife Windsurfing Professional wrestling slang Heat Railroad switch Glossary of ballet terms Fecal incontinence Simplified Chinese character Gramophone record Laser engraving Trigun B-47 Stratojet Robot Master DDT (professional wrestling) Kayak Harmonica Seppuku United States dollar Scissors Spark plug Floyd Rose Esperanto as an international language VHF omnidirectional range Trapping Fictitious force Jian Resident Evil (video game) Blacksmith Hydraulic machinery Chisel Heraldry

i need to install a ceiling fan but have no idea how i am extremely low on money and prefer to do it myself should i start by turning off the braker box my husband is out of town foe two weeks and it's hot the installation begins with choosing where the fan should be located in almost all homes the fan is installed in the center of the room replacing a central light fixture this spot provides a smooth air flow to most of the room since a fan draws about the same power as a ceiling fixture the electrical circuit shouldn't be overloaded but if your fan includes lights be sure the circuit it's on has enough extra capacity to handle the load if not you must run a new circuit with a new circuit breaker from the house main service panel or subpanel to the fan if there is no central light fixture you'll have to create a place to hang the ceiling fan then you'll need to bring electrical power to it you can tap into an existing circuit to do this check the blade clearance check the floor to ceiling height of the fan blades you can do this by measuring the floor to ceiling distance and subtracting for the part of the fan that will extend below the ceiling down to the lower blade surface an absolute minimum height of ' is recommended building codes in your area may reinforce this if the floor to ceiling distance is too little check into a low ceiling mount for your fan with some models the fan blade height can be increased by as much as remember though that you need at least between the ceiling and the tops of the fan blades for proper airflow having is better if the space is available complete detailed information at link below  Fireplace Kitchen Bong Wood fuel Fireplace poker Hydrogen economy Fire Natural gas Spark plug Firefighter Motor oil Drill bit Siphon Fire fighting Organ (music) Air pollution Renewable energy Flamethrower Internal ballistics Solar power Dog training RuneScape quests TARDIS Seismic retrofit Punt (boat) Apollo 13 Suppressor Sail-plan Coming of Age (TNG episode) Gas turbine Aerial (dance move) Fossil fuel power plant Sorting algorithm Chevrolet Corvair M4 Sherman Pipe organ Oxyacetylene Carburetor Mars, Pennsylvania Jet engine Logging Energy development Chimney The Empty Child Electrical wiring Thermal power station BS 1363 Manitoba Hydro Matroid Spacecraft propulsion Carbon dioxide Welding Common Unix Printing System M16 (rifle) Modem Carbon monoxide Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Sailing Irrigation Saw Radio controlled airplane Gas lighting Textile manufacturing Wood E85 Flush toilet Campfire Sewage treatment Glossary of firefighting equipment Stove Porsche 911 Wildfire De Lorean DMC-12 Diving cylinder Rebreather Glossary of wildland fire terms Dairy Country house Hand grenade Ammunition Rocket fuel Scuba set Windows XP Gas turbine-electric locomotive Pebble bed reactor Airbag Firearm Dinghy Gas metal arc welding Cello Two-stroke cycle Lighting M60 machine gun Hash table Battle of Tarawa Stanley Cup Shaggy dog story Toyota Prius Richard Rahl Tank

made mistake with wall filler how to fix hey i was using wall filler to fill the millions of holes in this concrete wall in my apartment so instead of just filling the holes i put way too much filler on and now the wall has like mm of filler all over it which is very uneven painted it white and it looks horrible so my question is is there any tool or chemical which can remove the wall filler back down to the concrete i tried sandpaper but its too thick thanks dan sandpapers aren't going to work on masonry what you need to get is what's called a rubbing stone go into home depot or lowe's masonry section and pick one up this is a relatively small cementuous block that has a plastic handle similar to a scrub bad on top of it this item is less than use the stone as if your sanding now being you've painted this wall the paints going to clog the stone so have a bucket of water handy to rinse off the paints residue from the stone as you work at feathering out your patches if you use a grinder you'll merely end up with marks and gouges making the problem worse and if you were to float or skim the wall over and aren't a pro at it you'll end up in deeper trouble if you need any additional help with this let me know mike lonergan tradesprofessional inc http www tradesprofessional com  Sheriff Political subdivisions of New York State Counties of the United States Miami-Dade County, Florida Plame affair Police Construction Elevator Logan County, Ohio United States Postal Service Trumbull County, Ohio County Warren County, Ohio Portage County, Ohio Do it yourself California government and politics Electrical wiring Law enforcement in France Fulton County, Georgia Cobb County, Georgia Article One of the United States Constitution Municipal government Medical prescription Water polo Athens, Georgia New Castle County, Delaware Government of Maryland United States Coast Guard ZIP Code Las Vegas, Nevada Montgomery County, Ohio Bay Area Rapid Transit Post-invasion Iraq, 2003___2005 Building code Glossary of firefighting terms Attorney General Unincorporated Dialysis Suburb Democratic Party (United States) Nike, Inc.

when i flush my toilet i have to hold down the handle to make it flush all the way and then the water only fills the bottom on the bowl what is causing this like many have said the chain from the handle to the flapper is probably too long shorten it the other possiblitly is the flappers design or condition the flapper stops the water in the tank from draining into the bowl until the pull chain lifts it out of the seat when pulled up the flapper kind of looks like an upside down cup with air trapped in the cup part it is this air that keeps the flapper up floating until enough water has left the tank to make the flapper fall again some flappers in poor attempts to save water are made with a small hole in the cup part that allows air to escape and therefore the flapper falls earlier allowing less water to to exit the tank if this is the case buy a new flapper that does not have this little hole in the cup part i have done this many times and it has worked every time even without a manufactured hole if the rubber of the flapper is breaking down there may be many small crack that the air is escaping through if your hands are covered in black debris from handling the flapper you may want to replace it with a design that does not have a hole hope this helps  Professional wrestling holds Ed, Edd n Eddy Counterfeit Professional wrestling match types Plastic bag Textile manufacturing Confidence trick Climbing equipment Professional wrestling Jackass: The Movie Krag-J__rgensen Pin oak Poker jargon Autograph Hazing Automatic teller machine Punk rock Cartridge (firearms) The Marriage of Figaro Professional wrestling slang Shackle Comanche Steering Hat BS 1363 Bookbinding Haircut Universal Serial Bus Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Roller chain Professional wrestling throws EastEnders Reamer Ocean's Twelve Professional wrestling aerial techniques Wood United States dollar Christmas tree WWE Unforgiven Pachypodium key to species Gay slang TIA-568A/B Texas hold 'em Hand grenade The Daily Show Mark Calaway Parachute Semi-automatic self-loading pistol Necktie Frogman Katelyn Faber Fractal Repeating rifle Firearm Elections in the United States Glossary of American football Clothing Pine Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Star Wars Holiday Special Jean Charles de Menezes The Big Lebowski Judo Gresham's law GunZ The Duel Upholstery Textile manufacturing terminology Glossary of climbing terms Pin (device) Drag racing Animaniacs Jeopardy!

installed nd thermostat i live in a raised ranch house there was only one thermostat installed in the house for both heat and air conditioning it is located on the lower level which is half way below the earth level it works fin in the winter for heating but not very well in the summer for air conditioning gets hot upstairs and always running downstairs to adjust for this problem i installed a very basic honeywell thermostat upstairs fished up the four conductor wire to the new one the wires go to white to w green to g red to rc and blue to y it works but their is one problem when i set the fan to on not auto the air conditioner kicks in the temperature contol has no affect the air conditioner stays on as long as the fan is set to on i know you might say well don't set it to on but sometimes i want to just run the fan by itself what is going on thanks dan the wiring to the thermostat was intended to go to just one thermostat having two of them connected to the same wiring is likely to cause problems especially if one were set to heat and the other to cool but even in the off setting it could have connected outputs together which normally doesnt matter since it isnt feeding them power that cause strange things to happen when the other thermostat is used red is common hot power white is call for heat the blue and green would be for a c and fan not sure which off the top of my head disconnect wires from original downstairs thermostat that run to the furnace if you connect red to white you should get heat probably after a short delay if you connect red to blue you will either get just the fan or the fan with a c the green will do the opposite once you have proved out what wires do what connect the common and heat wires should be the red and the white to the downstairs thermostat dont connect green blue it will now only have control over the heat feed the red green and blue wires to the upstairs thermostat and connect to the fan and a c connections the upstairs thermostat will control fan and a c but not heat most thermostats have a switch which will turn everything off at least as far as that thermostat is concerned never have them both turned on as it might try to heat and cool at the same time not very economical in the summer turn off downstairs thermostat and control a c with upstairs thermostat in winter turn off upstairs thermostat and control heat with the downstairs thermostat  Carpet Textile manufacturing Chair Mattress Knitting Textile Strap-on dildo Parachute Upholstery Drill bit Weaving Kimono Knife Plastic Persian rug Heraldry Wool Clothing Cloth Climbing equipment Tent Jennifer Lopez Wind turbine Leather Japanese tea ceremony Fur Jute Undergarment Printed circuit board Tire Equine conformation Bong Fiberglass Camouflage Casting Rigging Pottery Condom Hat Professional wrestling holds Transistor Livestock Symmetry Floppy disk Manual transmission Screw Anchor Violin Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Hamster Haircut Gramophone record Mars Exploration Rover Domestic rabbit Stairway Ship Abercrombie & Fitch Co.

electric fence question for anyone that has one or knows this please we have acres of electrical fence also strand of high tensel strength wire we wont to be able to see the remote corners of our fences across at night to make sure that they fence is making a complete circuit we have looked for neon strobes or something that would set of brillant flashes with every pulse of the fence something that works well and for long periods of time something we can see if anyone knows of anything that could help me that i could wire directly into the fence please let me know i cant seem to find anything that will let me know when its working we have the solar charger that blinks when working and completing circuit but the main wire going into the fence was not connected and the flasher was working so we thought it was working and the only reason we didnt know is the horse walked by the window we also have a strand around the house to keep the horses immediately from around the house if you can help i would appreciate it thanks hi no offense meant in this but curiousity i was raised on a acre farm and we had horses though never electrified a fence might there not be some monitoring system similar to an alarm system in a house that would alert you of any disruptions in service one might be in the barns stalls while the other is in the house certainly the mechanics for electrifying the fence have to be accessible somewhere i am in a position as a building maintenance mgr to have access to the alarm system on the keypad for example one sets the alarm with a code if the doors open which are on mag locks closing or opening a circuit the alarm beeps for a specific amount of time until and unless it's disarmed with a code  Elevator Eastern Illinois University Locked room mystery Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Serenity (Firefly vessel) Lock picking Derivative (finance) Jumpstart 3rd Grade Panama Canal Professional wrestling holds Episodes of Lost (Season 2) STS-61 The Dalek Invasion of Earth Wilton House Freed-Hardeman University Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Bristol Grammar School Sin City Volleyball Saw II Shawn Michaels Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Toyota Prius Columbine High School massacre Parade (military) De Lorean DMC-12 Friends Global System for Mobile Communications Dial M for Murder The Doctor Dances Colony in Space Japanese tea ceremony The Sims The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Arlington House M4 Carbine Boom Town (Doctor Who) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Key (lock) Drill bit Rugby union positions Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Situation calculus G-Man (Half-Life) The Visitation Shotgun Legends of the Hidden Temple DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Sento The Shining (film) Microsoft Jet Database Engine Vista Way Option The Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez Pin tumbler lock Marching band Armored Core Chevrolet Lumina APV The Ark in Space Aliens of London Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Ministry of Magic Volkswagen Type 2 (T3) Property tax What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

i need input on installing flagstone pavers my wife and i just purchased about four hundred square feet of flagstone pavers i am not the construction worker type but i am learning how to be a do it yourselfer we live in very temperate san diego so the cold weather is not an issue and in sd earthquakes are not a real concern for us either at first we thought of just putting in gravel and sand and laying them on top but the more i have read it sounds like it really needs to be in at least a mortar sand mixture and definetly grouted what do you think i will choose a best answer and will probably spend a lot of time taking your advice in my backyard the process is quite simple really if the product is regular flagstone it is much easier if you bought the concrete pavers that look like flagstone square tile with a stamped flagstone pattern it is more difficult but still possible we purchase first inches of limestone and pour that into the bed for the patio or walkway next level this out by eye and move anything that will not allow it to be flat ie stones roots etc now install a commercial grade weed barrier fabric and pin in place with landscape fabric pins lapping the fabric uinches over itself at the seams now place your flagstone or tiles on top of this fabric levelling with small amounts of masonary sand as you go once downcover the entire surface with masonary sand and use a push broom to work it in beneath the gaps between the paver stone or tile these gaps should be between and and inches depending only on your taste finally opposed to grout there is a product called gator dust which we use a very high grade of polymeric sand this fills in the last one half inch or so after sweeping the masonary sand in use first a vibratory tamper to seat the surface into the bed and to level any imperfections if you place a sheet of osb or plywood between the tamper and your pavers the breakage will be minimal you will wash the surface with a misting of water do not pressure wash the sand will disappear into the cracks allow it to dry take the polymeric sand and apply with a broom work it into your cracks sweep the excess to one end now gently mist the end until the sand disappears allow to dry sweep the sant to the opposite end mist and allow to dry repeat this process untill the area will take no more sand sweep up the excees and vacuum up remaining surface sand now for a really great look apply a commercial sealer and give it that professional edge makes it impermmeable to the elements just a note a pressure treated lumber frame will add years to the life of your work the polymeric sand will work in concert with the weed barrier fabric to make your hard work free of weeds for years to come good luck to you  Condominium Downtown Cleveland McMansion Disney's California Adventure Jean Schmidt Campbell, California S__o Paulo Cohousing Beverly Hills, California Google Minneapolis, Minnesota Three Gays of the Condo Columbine High School massacre Donald Trump White flight Culver City, California Coney Island The Brady Bunch Milwaukee, Wisconsin Paul Hackett Scottsdale, Arizona Altair 8800 Home insurance Richard Chase Pasadena, California Filling station Walt Disney Concert Hall Japanese toilet Operation Days of Penitence Disneyland Car boot sale Anarchism and society Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts Tenderloin, San Francisco North York, Ontario Crystal City, Virginia San Francisco, California Los Angeles Times Madison, Wisconsin Real estate broker Cabrini-Green Coffeehouse Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Inkjet printer Crowd psychology Genesis (band) Carlsbad, California Shopping mall Dallas, Texas Neighbourhood (mathematics) 1948 Arab-Israeli War Glossary of graph theory Action potential Wall Street Boris Becker Fallujah C__line Dion Nintendo GameCube Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold Time Warner Center Lee Harvey Oswald Rio de Janeiro Tobacco advertising The Vines Norfolk International Airport Eaton's Cupertino, California A6 road Terrorism against Israel in 2002 Mercedes-Benz A-Class Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Great Depression Video game crash of 1983 Edgewater (Chicago) Pentagon City, Virginia Kitty Genovese Neighborhoods of Chicago Door Richard Christy UK Singles Chart Sale Sharks St. Francis, Wisconsin 50 Cent Crystal Lake, Illinois Capitol Hill, Denver, Colorado Best Buy Sun Valley, Idaho Gare du Nord Burnsville, Minnesota Cellular automaton Cerritos, California Oldsmobile Silhouette Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Monster Garage Tiananmen Automatic teller machine Zoning Las Vegas Strip Dave Matthews Band San Francisco International Airport

is there such a thing as an easy to install laminate that looks good or should i forget about it and just pay to have hardwood floors installed laminate wood floors are fairly easy to install the most important part is preparation it's imperative that you prepare the floor well if you have some sort of deteriorated flooring now you will likely have to remove it make sure that your floor is level and smooth take the trim off before doing any installation once you have the floor clean vacuum it well before you lay anything smooth and level there is a backing material that you buy separately from the flooring if you buy the better backing your floor shouldn't squeak as much make sure to keep things clean through every stage of installation when you install the flooring leave a gap of about a quarter inch around the entire room the floor 'floats' and this can help you put difficult boards down try to have the gap even around the edges before you put the trim on for tricky boards i find it useful to make a template with paper first and measure everything a few times before cutting this takes a little bit of time and patience but your floor will look nicer and you will have fewer waste boards also use a piece of x to pound the boards together this prevents damage to the edges of the boards i have assisted in the installation of regular hardwood flooring it's hard on the knees noisy you need to rent a special nailing tool the floors need sanded and sealed etc laminates are vastly easier for a regular person to install i'm a respiratory therapist what do i know about carpentry and a pretty large area can be done in a day if you choose to go laminate there are places like discount stores i e ollie's that might have material available for cheap my bedroom floor for five years was laminate from there and it worked fine it even mated to the laminate we added through the rest of the second floor of the house from home depot my floor squeaked less than the other areas because better underlay was used in my room  Epoxy Plastic Casting Seismic retrofit Deck (ship) Boat building Dinghy Reinforced concrete Printed circuit board Fiberglass Concrete Glass Woodworking Graphite-reinforced plastic Upholstery Xanadu House Fuselage Homebuilt aircraft Stucco Carbon fiber Polyurethane Basement Wood carving Friction Mattress Paint Poker jargon Molding (decorative) Tire Drill bit Geodesic dome Straw-bale construction Timber framing Masonry Radio controlled airplane Brazing Architecture of the California missions Tlingit Anchor Horseshoe Glacier Drawing Composite material Brush Bulk vending Sand casting Drywall RMS Titanic Knife Pavement (material) Passenger car Wind turbine Chevrolet Corvair Glossary of nautical terms 24 Hours of Le Mans Dishwasher Fire extinguisher Betting (poker) Thermal power station Radio controlled car Massage Brewery Ford Mustang Cosmic Era technology San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans First aid kit Leather Windsurfing Wayne Corporation Mosaic Opportunity rover Textile manufacturing terminology Ammolite History of Test cricket (to 1883) Drag racing Las Vegas metropolitan area Plaster Apple Die (manufacturing) Wood finishing Great Pyramid of Giza Pebble bed reactor Radar cross section Varnish Kit Kat SS Normandie USS Ticonderoga (CV-14) Magnetism Tier One Soap Tofu Apollo Command/Service Module Volkswagen Golf Hamster Amateur telescope making Manicure Arcade cabinet Drainage

installing ceramic tile i need step by step instructions on how to install ceramic tile in a bathroom on a concrete slab first of all measure ur bathroom and calculate how many square meters u need then decide on your tile layout where u want the tiles to start and end normally you want to have full tiles in visible areas and have the cut tiles in less visible areas behind doors under basin cabinet behind toilet you should check ur levels to make sure the water runs to the floor drain and if there is no floor drain make sure it runs to one area that is accesible to dry make sure it doesnt run towards the door and that you dont get multiple puddles if the levels are not already done you will need to apply a screed of concrete no coarse aggregate and trowl it to the desired levels once that is set you decide on what type of binding agent glue or mortar that best suites your needs pick a starting point a corner in which u would use a whole tile and as you go keep checking ur levels to maintain the correct slope for the water you will probably need a tile cutting tool for area where you cant use a whole tile that is just a basic idea of what ull need to do  McMansion Microeconomics Xanadu House House The Brady Bunch Bungalow New Urbanism Kitchen Florida Institute of Technology Mansion Bathroom Transformer Construction Wilton House Electrical wiring Seismic retrofit Home improvement Japanese toilet World Trade Center White House Le Corbusier 2Step Orlando, Florida Surplus value Capital accumulation Bloody Stupid Johnson Arlington County, Virginia Campbell, California Real estate broker University of Scranton Zoning RISC Passive solar Dormitory Toilet paper Tax Blenheim Palace Cosmo Kramer Echo chamber Hybrid vehicle Mattress 742 Evergreen Terrace Shotgun house Inflation Francis Bacon (painter) University of Tennessee at Chattanooga Pforzheimer House Carlsbad, California Gold standard Warren Buffett Hurricane Rita Donald Trump Loudspeaker Hamster Solar power Law of value Epcot Panel__k Autograph Computer Toilet Friends Insulation Restrictive covenant Gross domestic product Monticello Concrete Fecal incontinence Mortgage Monopoly (game) Straw-bale construction Urban sprawl Masonry Templeogue Syphon Filter Harlem The Champions Urban planning Sears Catalog Home Mobile home Apartment Diving suit Cerritos, California The Inside Holly Lodge Estate Galactic Civilizations Buckingham Palace Ridge Route The Apprentice 2 Berkshire Hathaway West Side Highway Light rail Knots Landing Capitalism Value added tax Space Shuttle program Steve Jobs University of Central Florida

what do you use to cover a textured wall i have walls that have several layers of paint and paper on them so they look rough and textured i do not want to remove all of that so i want to know what i can use to cover a wall and texture it you can do as sensible man said and paint it with texture pain but my advice would be to strip it down because sooner or later as you add layers of paint it will all just fall off and if as you say there are lots of layers of paint and wall paper on there you chances are pretty high that it could get messy while you try paint it this time so best option is to strip the walls and do them properly  Epoxy Reinforced concrete Varnish Plastic Paint Deck (ship) Resin Casting Lacquer Guinea pig Sharpie (marker) Bong Terrazzo Animal Crossing Manicure Adhesive Carbon fiber Rachel Whiteread Fiberglass Petrochemical Friction Abercrombie & Fitch Co.

how to soundproof laminate flooring effectively we have engineered 'click' laminate floating floor with a thick underlay which comes in panels our neighbors complain about the noise they can hear each step we make how can we make the flooring soundproof while maintaining the strength of the floor try looking for accoustic underlay i dont know of any specific brand what you want is low density underlay which would dampen the sound better sound travels best through higher density material so you want to give the sound waves less matter to travel through also if the laminate flooring is installed over timber construction flooring you should look at installing accoustic foam inbetween floor joists which would reduce the resonance the laminate flooring is installed over high density particle board sheet flooring which is installed over the ceiling joists of the level below the hollow area between ur floor and their ceiling acts like a resonance chambre of a guitar which just enhances the noise transfered through the wood so you would want to install something to dampen the noise in that hollow part of the floor construction don't hesitate to contact me for further details if my answer is what you are looking for  Casting Stucco Drawing Paint Wood Glaze Doom engine Volleyball Menstrual cup Tofu Wallpaper 2D computer graphics Mattress Valles Marineris Canvas Pottery Dundas Square Deck (ship) Opportunity rover Abdomen Roof Polymer clay Fan (implement) Nudity Etching Sistine Chapel Thomas Jefferson Painting Fecal incontinence Condom Xbox 360 Mach kernel Rice Stained glass Geographic information system Equine conformation Manicure Snow Kidney Floppy disk Drill bit Masonry Seismic retrofit Gramophone record Acrylic paint Aortic dissection Super Mario 64 Straw-bale construction Newspaper Pubic hair Sega Saturn Fire fighting Vitreous enamel Typewriter Foreskin Piano Drew Struzan Marble Wound PlayStation 2 Dodge Neon Undergarment Atherosclerosis Cognitive science Rendering (computer graphics) Climbing equipment Pretty Good Privacy Sandpaper Curling Tooth Pompeii Geology of Venus Sacred Harp Black pepper Igneous rock Rococo Chinese painting Nuclear weapon design Aneurysm __atalh__y__k Solar cell Metal leaf Nintendo GameCube Circuit design Depilation Metamorphic rock Vegetation Avalanche Surrealist techniques Transformer Bread Stereoscopy Japanese tea ceremony DVD The Last Supper (Leonardo) Wood carving Transport layer The Wall Street Journal Downing Street memo

do ac units blow at the temp set on the thermostat i am trying to understand how to operate my thermostat i am being told that depending on what i have the temperature set at the ac unit will blow at a temp that is more or less cool i am not in agreeance with this what i have always understood was the ac unit blows at one cool temp and if the fan is set on auto the thermostat will shut the ac off once the room reaches the temp you have set it to if the fan is set on on the ac will blow nonstop regardless of what the temp is set to am i mistaken or can i stuff a sock in my advisors mouth ill try to make it as clear as possible lets look at the components of an ac system the compressor which cycles the coolant through the coils it is either on or off the thermostat switch is a temperature sensing switch it turns the compressor on when the return the air coming back into the ac temeperature rises above the set temperature the fan control switch which controls the speed of the blower fan now lets look at how they all work together lets say you have the thermostat set to degrees c f the compressor will keep running until the room temperature reaches c once the set temperature is reached the compressor will shut down until the temperature goes over c again thats why the noise of an ac changes now about the fan setting normally there are fan settings hi mid low and auto the manual settings hi mid low stay the same once you set them they dont get affected by the temperature and just keep blowing at the set speed the auto setting runs in conjunction with the thermostat if the room temperature is much higher than the set temperature the fan will run at a higher speed once the temperature drops to the desired temperature the fan speed will drop to lower speeds to reduce noise and electrical consumption i hope i made sense if you have any further questions don't hesitate to contact me  Seismic retrofit Guitar Light-frame construction Drill bit Transformer Soundproofing Deck (ship) Glass Laminal consonant Stairway Timber framing Mattress Wood Sound Drywall Straw-bale construction Acoustic guitar Squash (sport) Dishwasher Parquetry Acoustics Equine conformation Casting Nuclear weapon design Piano Cello Tide Nuclear magnetic resonance Violin Gramophone record Wind turbine Volleyball Spark plug Helicopter Solar cell Space elevator Radar Sun Atherosclerosis Welding Asbestos The Parting of the Ways Door Optical fiber Radar cross section Wind power Insulation Plywood Brewery Suppressor Resonance TV-FM DX Fire fighting Fan (implement) Supersonic transport Antenna (radio) Diode Stuttering Bass guitar Explosive material Carburetor Cosmic Era technology Saxophone Naval mine Gas metal arc welding Tank Wood carving Helium Air-raid shelter Jet engine Sound effect Thermal power station Plastic Subtractive synthesis Electronic filter Laser Digital-to-analog converter Electric guitar Ionosphere Microphone Sewage treatment Solar power TGV Equal-loudness contour Vacuum Magnet Big band Carpet Lighting King Khalid International Airport Particle accelerator Upholstery Phase (matter) Golf club (equipment) Quantum mechanics Audio system measurements Vacuum tube

how can i fix a toilet that's leaking out the back and side of the tank i just moved into a new apartment and i suddenly have a weird problem with my toilet whenever i flush the toilet water starts leaking out the right side of the tank into the floor it's like too much water is refilling the tank or something the maintenance people in my apartment take forever and don't seem to be very competent is there a way i can fix this myself any ideas what might be wrong thanks in advance for any help you can give me i think i wasn't specific enough with the place of the leak the water is coming out of the top of the lid of the tank and running down the side into the floor take the lid off the tank and see what is happening if the amount of water of a refill is actually overflowing the tank then you need to adjust the device that regulates the level at which the water stops flowing this could be a ball on the end of a metal arm in which case you may need to ajust a screw that changes the angle of the arm or you may need to bend the arm so the ball engages at a lower water level if it is a float device that shuts off when it floats to a certain level you need to adjust the clip that shuts off the flow when the float gets high enough these are the two most common fixes it all depends on what is inside your toilet if there is something wrong with the refill mechanism other than adjusting the fill level then you probably shouldn't tackle that yourself if you have no idea what you are doing you could break the toilet or cause a flood which would end up being very expensive problems  Jet engine Turbocharger Temperature Axial compressor Thermal power station Turbofan Electric motor Supercharger Fan (implement) Transformer HVAC Refrigerator Diesel engine Turbojet Carburetor Gas compressor Toyota Prius Air conditioning Gas turbine Central processing unit Ocean thermal energy conversion Heat Vacuum Two-stroke cycle Furnace Solar power Phase change heat pump Dodge Neon Apollo 13 Engine cooling Propeller Bi-metal Control system Cray-1 Overclocking Supersonic transport Wind power Ford Ranger EV Welding Thermoregulation Mercury Atlas 6 Skateboarding trick MOSFET Stirling engine Nuclear power Embedded system Nuclear reactor Three Mile Island Digital circuit Transistor Circuit breaker Heinkel He 100 Motor oil Explosive material Pratt & Whitney J58 Magnetic core memory Fossil fuel power plant Rebreather Stall (flight) Equine conformation Helium Bicycle Climate of the United Kingdom Steam engine Oscilloscope Automobile Wind turbine SABRE Audio level compression Ozone depletion Swamp cooler CPU cooling Hard disk Ceramics Ironing Personal rapid transit Electrophysiology Gas absorption refrigerator Spacecraft propulsion Loudspeaker CPU design Monsoon Internal combustion engine Hydrogen economy Mooney M20 Thermocouple Aircraft engine controls Hot air balloon E85 Microphone Fire fighting

we've discovered a big hole in our ceiling help help my husband and i are ripping out our kitchen and going to put in new cabinets lights flooring all that stuff so we ripped down the old cabinets and the old soffit over the sink previously there were two lights sort of recessed in the soffitt but when we took out the soffitt we found two huge holes in the ceiling with the electrical wires coming out the holes about a foot wide each the stove is going to go under this spot now and it's in front of a window so we dont have alot of options for fixing it can anyone give any ideas on what to do we need to have lighting there other than that options are totally open help and thanks if the ceiling is sheetrock drywall or plaster then you can cut the plaster or sheetrock back to the middle of a ceiling joist cut patches out of another sheet of sheetrock and screw them to the ceiling joist use drywall tape and joint compound and a wide blade putty knife to smooth out the joint then texture as needed to match the rest of the ceiling if the ceiling is wood or metal that are hard to match a patch to then you might want to build a shallow wood box around the area over the stove and mount your new lights in that since there was a soffit there before then i assume the window does not go all the way up to the ceiling so this should work o k if the window does goes all the way up to the ceiling then you may need to cut out a section of the damaged ceiling and put in new boards or whatever the ceiling material is  Bong Glass Drill bit Printed circuit board Floppy disk Drill Drill bit sizes Drilling and threading Smoking pipe Ketchup Safe-cracking Metalworking Casting Fiberglass Bottle Solar cell Cannabis (drug) Screw Die (manufacturing) Drill bit shank Diamond enhancement Oil well Textile manufacturing Hamster Coffee Knife Ice core Champagne (beverage) Plastic Woodworking Milk Nalgene Brush Apollo 15 Christmas tree Inca Kola Beverly Hills, California Energy development Wine bottle Float glass Derrick (lifting device) Jackhammer Baby bottle Port wine Compact disc Cathode ray tube Shotgun Molotov cocktail Wayne Corporation Hitler's death Drilling mud Prohibition Recycling Directional drilling Shotgunning Cider Wheat beer Tea ITunes Music Store Piccolo Junior Saga PHP Textile manufacturing terminology Seismic retrofit Polyethylene terephthalate Hand grenade Aluminum can Stereoscopy W.

how do i repair concrete pilasters i have just had the sign to my shop front replaced however in replacement one of the side pilasters capitals has cracked and broken these are made from a concrete mixture i think and painted over the years deteriorated so crumbling was to be expected i have search the net for answers but can't seem to find if the square decorative parts which are only decorative are called pilasters capitals consoles or corbels there are two one either side of the shop front at the top and protrude slightly from the wall my question is how do i repair them i don't want to get someone to do this as we did had them repaired last year and the builder made a mess of the job i would like to get them back to original shape basically like a think key line around a box firstly anything that jutts out of a wall is called apilaster and a free standing one is called a capital you can repair that by simply taking a bag of readymix concreta and fill the fissures or the part that has come out but please be sure that the surface you are putting this mixture is coarse just puncture it if not so so that the mixture binds to it and cure it by covering with wet gunny bags for days hope this helps  Screw Drill bit Vise (tool) Wrench Glossary of climbing terms Clinker (boat building) Screwdriver Screw thread Spark plug Welding Drill Tire Violin Woodworking Hydraulic machinery Lathe Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Gas metal arc welding Seismic retrofit Upholstery Climbing equipment Textile manufacturing Guitar Earring Taps and dies Aluminium Knife Propeller Drilling and threading Printed circuit board Harmonica Clockwise and counterclockwise Rail tracks Floppy disk Bolted joint Socket Incandescent light bulb Floyd Rose Pottery Casting Explosive belt Katana Diving cylinder Lathe (metal) Disc brake Carburetor Sonic the Hedgehog 2 IPod Internal ballistics Timpani Fuse (electrical) Carbon nanotube Die (manufacturing) Derrick (lifting device) Textile manufacturing terminology Fencing Gramophone record Anchor Chopped & screwed Handloading Corrosion Machine tapers Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Drywall Robot Master Oxyacetylene Mercury 4 Equine conformation Hand grenade Sonic screwdriver Mandrel BS 1363 Arc welding Unified Thread Standard Bassoon Reamer Plate armour Protection (climbing) Campfire Motor oil Bulk vending Leica Micrometer Boat building Connecting rod Bicycle frame Knitting Metallurgy Rifle Brazing Dental brace Heckler & Koch G3 Laser Cross-country skiing Stairway Bong Mnemonic San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Nuclear weapon design

how do i build a base for a shed i am putting up a playhouse for my children and dont particularly want to lay a concrete base do you know of an easier effective alternative i know concrete might sound messy and complicated to deal with but if you choose any other alternative you will probably regret it if you go with wood you would have to raise it above the ground to avoid moisture which would rot the wood and attract insects and rodents it shouldn't be to complex if you are pretty sure that ur ground is solid enough you don't need to reinforce the concrete for a building that size unless you will have brick walls just dig out about inches of dirt and lay plastic sheeting membrane as a moisture barrier and then pour your concrete and trowl it if you want to build it to last longer you can reinforce your concrete slab with mm inch steel mesh and just place it on reo chairs or just small wooden blocks to raise the mesh off the ground then pour your concrete and trowl it that will leave you with a smooth solid floor which will prevent bugs and moisture and last you for as long as you want it to if you have any further questions or would like a sketch of it i'd be happy to help  Drill bit Equine conformation Wood carving Screw Timber framing Harmonica Supply and demand Skateboarding trick Krag-J__rgensen Seismic retrofit Nine Inch Nails Woodworking Punt (boat) Tire Glossary of partner dance terms Radio controlled airplane Leaf Cross site scripting Wind turbine AmigaOS Textile manufacturing XML Clinker (boat building) Time Out of Mind Professional wrestling throws Basic English Linked list Gmail Strap-on dildo HTML Katana Preferred number Ajax (programming) Violin Saw Chatsworth House Passenger car Swingout History of the Internet HyperText Transfer Protocol Regular polytope Bicycle frame Ski View camera Fight Club Einstein-Cartan theory Billboard (advertising) M.C.

is there any way to improve plastic scratch resistance hmm was wondering for sometime on this q is there any real way to improve plastic's scratch resistance like spraying some hard coat to uncoated plastic and vice versa we all know plastic is really easy to get scratches in no time even if you are careful the only way i know is overlay screen protector else a plastic sheet over it to prevent but is it possible to add the original plastic resistant to scratches i pretty worried when i going to buy a ps soon and will encounter this issue and heard of so many negative comments about it any ideas for an existing handheld game screen you are pretty much limited to the plastic screen protector films i have heard of people cutting out their own protective films from sheets of vue graph film since that might be a little thicker than some protective films you can however if you have a touch screen then that can interfere with the response i would not try spraying anything on the screen for fear that it might have a solvent affect and make the screen hazy if you are talking about protecting the plastic case then there are adhesive films that you can buy that adhere to the surface of the box these are used on many products nowadays from car fenders when they are shipped to watch faces and swim goggle lenses they are usually meant to be peeled off before you use them but could be left on and periodically replaced as needed as long as you didn't need to be able to see through them very well  Concrete Seismic retrofit Drill bit Masonry Hamster Mattress Straw-bale construction Reinforced concrete Basement Air-raid shelter Rail tracks Casting Building material Pavement (material) Chair Upholstery Geodesic dome Light-frame construction Natural building Cremation Prestressed concrete Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Retaining wall Pile Boat building Vault Knife Vermicompost Pottery Stucco Floppy disk Kitchen Dam Menstrual cup Barbecue Le Corbusier Bass guitar Desert Road Radio masts and towers Fallout shelter Tofu Lumber Cinder block Stairway Shotgun Carburetor M16 (rifle) Drywall Microeconomics Dinghy Golf Passive solar Panama Canal Locks Pok__mon Abilities Ridge Route A151 road Anchor Rathfarnham Opportunity rover Gypsy moth Hoover Dam Ship model Screw Xanadu House Thermal power station Motorcycle helmet Adobe Wind turbine Shell (projectile) Fire fighting Trench warfare Printmaking Acne Fecal incontinence Mouse (computing) Collecting fossils Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Fancy rat Eifel Aqueduct Combine (Half-Life 2) Vacuum Guitar Wrigley Field NASCAR Fender Telecaster Dairy Harley-Davidson Comanche World Trade Center Barbed wire

how can i build anyone here know how to build a wooden notepad holder that uses old printing calculator paper tape ribbons with basic woodworking tools like saw miter box or less there were too many that came up in my search so i was wondering if anyone has come across a plan to make this lately sorry precious j you are most definitely not my therapist i happen to believe in recycling i have a office in my home for years i want to recycle the paper that goes with the calculator that just broke yes i had a wooden note pad holder that used them but broke years ago you must have lots of suicides if you regularly address your patients like that licensing board haven't you heard the phrase if you don't know don't answer btw maybe this explanins my mil who refuses meds but has many hobbies i haven't seen any plans for such a notepad but i recall one my parents had that looked fairly simple to make the paper roll sat in a rectangler box that had a lid with hinges mounted on one of the short edges the lid had a wire tied tight between two screws across the lid at the end opposite the hinge the paper came out of the box over the end of the lid and under this wire another wire was tied tight between two screws across the lid at the end near the hinge or it might have been a strip of serrated metal tacked to the lid like you might find on an aluminum foil or plastic wrap box to tear the paper that was pretty much it except for some decoration you would drop the roll of paper into the box and feed the end of the paper out of the box at the end opposite the hinge under the first wire down the lid and then under the second wire or metal cutting strip you would write on the paper on the lid of the box and then pull the paper down under the metal strip and tear it off to take with you  Basement Home repair Dehumidifier Autonomous building Road Solar power Poker jargon Houseplant Titanium Windows XP Hydroponics MS-06 Zaku II Septic tank CPU cache Circuit design Hydrogen economy Trademark Animal Crossing Midlothian, Virginia Air conditioning Hard disk Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Piccadilly Circus E85 Cannabis cultivation Apollo Guidance Computer Union Pacific Railroad Overhead lines Toilet paper Domestic water system C programming language Rum Mortgage Objective-C AmigaOS Lionel Corporation Erie Canal Boston Public IBM PC compatible Milwaukee, Wisconsin Publishing DD tank Motorola 68000 Chatsworth House System/34 Surveillance Water tower Plastic Trail Thermal power station Debugging Transportation of Los Angeles Eutrophication Mars, Pennsylvania Renewable energy P-38 Lightning Watercooling Inkjet printer Dynamic Systems Development Method Mac OS X Common Fisheries Policy ZX Spectrum United States House of Representatives Nuclear power Automatic number plate recognition Steam (content delivery) Ammonium nitrate In vitro fertilisation Imperial Crypt Town gas Sewage treatment Motor oil Francis Bacon (painter) 2003 North America blackout MDAC Internet fraud Spring operating system System/36 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Betting (poker) Pretty Good Privacy Computer virus The Miracles Docklands Light Railway Penske Racing Torquay United F.C.

how do i cut my flowers so i want to plant some sweet peas flower and i read the back of the package which says care water regularly and deeply cut flowers at least every other day and remove all seed pods what does the last sentence mean cut the flowers cut them off what seed pods help please i've never really planted anything my life and i'm quite clueless as how to start thank you it's too late to be planting sweet peas i would keep your packet until next year and plant them in the spring you do not need to cut the flowers off or the pods when you plant your seeds make sure you plant them where they can grow up against a fence or trellis and let them grow wild they will grow high and look really lovely keep the pods on the plant until they have finished flowering the pods look just like a pea pod which grows on the plant then you have loads of seeds for some more plants when they have finished flowering and starting to die off take the pods off the plant let them dry out and then split them so you have all the new seeds for the next year keep in an airtight container until you are ready to plant out  Legal tender United States dollar United States Postal Service Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Euro Article One of the United States Constitution Fiat money Federal Reserve Monetary policy Money supply Philippine peso U.S. ten-dollar bill Copyright Hyperinflation Salmon P.

can i clean my concrete driveway and or brick wall with bleach i just finished cleaning my deck with straight bleach and it looks wonderful yes you can use bleach or one of the masonry cleaners available from the building supply store you may need to use it with a power washer sprayer since the brick and concrete have a rougher surface pits and cracks that a brush may not be able to get clean be careful using bleach around your plants and grass bleach is also a great weed killer and it will kill good plants too if you do get it on your plants then rinse them well with water to get the bleach off their leaves and to dilute the bleach in the soil  Drill bit Masonry Plastic Seismic retrofit Welding Stucco Liquid crystal display Mortar (masonry) Steel Knife Password cracking Leather Gesso Iron Casting Corrosion Titanium Home repair Gramophone record Glacier Apollo 8 Cast iron Fast bowling Paint Sword making Brewery Compact fluorescent lamp Hard disk Breastfeeding Color Japanese tea ceremony Drawing Motorcycle Diamond cut Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Diamond Polyvinyl alcohol Aquatic ape hypothesis Amber Pottery Toffee Equine conformation Reinforced concrete Seabird Pastel Sebaceous gland Dam Brittle Katana Manganese Mattress Gasoline Korean War Polarizer Impressionism Stainless steel Hubble Space Telescope Cryptanalysis Tocopherol Die making Crucible steel Arcade cabinet Parchment Chimney Minoan civilization Fracture mechanics Cubism Sandpaper Horseshoe Mixtape Sundial Alcoholic beverage On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Laserdisc Floppy disk Metallurgy Cookware and bakeware Flood geology Sound recording Incandescent light bulb St. Peter's Basilica Aluminium Construction Graffiti Springfield 1903 rifle Blonde on Blonde Sewage treatment Queen (album) Concrete Tooth enamel Cocaine Aggregate (composite) De Lorean DMC-12 Alcoholics Anonymous Endowment (Mormonism) Diving Hashish Portland cement Alan Arnold Griffith

why do manufacturers make it so hard to get into a cd and they put a light bulb in a small box with open ends thank you cute question caused me to chuckle at least not to sound sarcastic but we can't play a lightbulb actually the issue is more about just the packaging it's light weight for a bulb and we should assume they are fragile anyway it probably would't matter much if they were packed in foam one might still drop one taking it out of the box the good news is that cd's are pretty much going to go the way of the tracks at some point especially since the advent of mp 's etc my issue with music and most especially on a cd album cassette is that i'm very selective and usually don't want or need the other tracks regarding packaging in general however that business is as large albeit sometimes subtle as what products go into the packaging one of my least faves is anything packed in clear plastic that i have to slice through to get to the product hence possibly voiding any ability to return it as fine print states in original condition good q though steven wolf  Masonry Sodium hypochlorite Seismic retrofit Water purification Hemp Brush Drill bit Brewery Weed control Dishwasher Washing machine Dishwashing Weed Irrigation Textile manufacturing Herbicide Brick Moss Building material Carnivorous plant Detergent Car washing techniques Retaining wall Vacuum cleaner Dry cleaning Upholstery Hebburn Illegal drug trade Tillage Air-raid shelter Architecture of the California missions Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Sugar beet Deforestation Bleach (manga) Leaf Poker jargon Chimney Disinfection Japanese toilet Maize Houseplant Solar power Dam Coal Hydrogen peroxide Passive solar Flowering plant Tea Lawn Organic peroxide Menstrual cup Laundry detergent Water resources Mortar (masonry) Bleach Coir Wetland Contact lens Adobe Environmental concerns with electricity generation Arch bridge Basement Sewage treatment Domestic water system Toilet Halitosis Desertification Tooth Sorghum Chlorine Hamster Concrete Town gas Manicure Gilding Stucco Japanese tea ceremony Natural building Septic tank Essential oil Gypsy moth Cinder block Ozone Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Comfrey Creeping Charlie Fireplace Anchor American Psycho Biodynamic agriculture Tooth enamel Soil Agriculture Sodium percarbonate Nuclear power Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Ammonia Home repair

i want to put curtains up i have very old huge windows with lots of framing around them how much higher do i put the rod above the top of the window i can't seem to find an answer on the internet if you want an elegant look then hang the curtain rod closer to the ceiling or even at the ceiling make sure the rod is long enough to extend past the side framing a couple of inches or more a common postion for the rod wall bracket is inches above and inches outside of the head casing this can be adjusted as needed to fit the size of pre made curtains so you can save some money on custom curtains if the framing casing has nice details and you are only installing the curtains to block the sunlight from coming in and fading your upholstery fabrics then you might want to just install window tinting you will still have full view out the window and not cover up the nice casing and the tinting would block the damaging uv rays  Thermostat Thermal power station Sento Basement Solar power Apartment building Domestic water system United States House of Representatives Plumbing fixture Climate of the United Kingdom Mechanical floor Deep lake water cooling Chatsworth House Children of Dune Water Sandworm (Dune) Dune (novel) Bathroom Bathing Central heating Professional wrestling throws Sengkang Autonomous building Queensbridge Pump It Up Diesel engine Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Apartment Ocean thermal energy conversion Article One of the United States Constitution Solar system Kitchen Diving regulator Housing cooperative Electrical wiring (UK) Steam engine Slot machine Hydropower Concurrent estate Table saw Leasing Diving suit Fountain History of nuclear weapons Cold War Oil platform Brewery Government of France HVAC Renewable energy Leasehold estate Air conditioning Coruscant Warm-blooded Trapped in the Closet Spandau Prison New Lanark Wave power USS Yorktown (CV-5) Concrete House Water supply Iowa class battleship Poker jargon Sewage treatment Newcomen steam engine Firefighter Hubert H.

does blood clog drains i have a friend that is convinced her drain in her shower is clogged because she got a really bad cut on her foot earlier this week and when she was in the shower it bleed profusely and now her drain is clogged but it has been clogged for a while i think that the blood just maybe dried around hair or something but blood doesn't clog drains does it short answer no the way that a p trap is designed it would be nearly impossible for blood to clog a drain after the water runs down the drain there is a chamber that is filled with about cups of water this is referred to as a p trap its purpose is to seal out fumes from the sewer septic system that could be toxic she would have had to fill up the p trap with blood and then not ran the water for a few days to have the blood dry up enough for it to clog the drain there is to much water existing in the p trap it would have diluted the blood to much for this to happen what probably did happen was that there was an existing hair clog already in the drain and it just started to completely clog and flow water back into the fixture a conventional drain clog remover should get her back in business again if you need anything more powerful there is a product that is called liquid fire sulfuric acid that will clear anything that is down there  Burglar alarm Crime prevention through environmental design Surveillance Microeconomics Combine (Half-Life 2) Mouse (computing) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Electrophysiology Traffic light Smoke detector Piezoelectricity Grandview, U.S.A.
