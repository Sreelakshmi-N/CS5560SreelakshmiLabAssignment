can anyone help me fix an acoustic solutions lcd tv model lcd nk hd please help me i purchased a lcd tv it was ok for a couple of days and then all of a sudden i seem get very bad picture roll for which i have to keep switching the tv on and off repeatedly to resolve however the worst problem i have is very bad colour bleed the only way i can describe it is that it's like watching a live action cartoon if that makes any sense at all the background seems to go blue and the objects are red and green as you can imagine this is very frustrating sometimes i can resolve the problem by switching the tv off and on but other times i'm stuck with it please please somebody help me i would be eternally grateful cheers acoustic solutions tvs are made by a company called vestel contrary to what another answerer has said there is nothing inherently wrong with the components but i have noticed that the soldering is rather poor with many dry joints also they seem to have rather poor quality control so occasionally you may get the odd duff capacitor or whatever that slips through when it should have got replaced before shipment the fact that you can fix the problem by effectively putting a power spike through the circuit by switching off is quite symptomatic of a failed electrolytic capacitor the spike will cause the electrolyte to temporarily reform and then things will work for a while until it starts breaking down again if so find the duff capacitor and replace it and all will be well i have two sets one is perfect the other has a minor problem on the power amp which i can't be bothered to fix as i play the sound from it through my stereo however i would concur that unless like me you have access to the circuit diagrams and service manuals then the sensible first step would be to go back to the store but if that fails then take it to an electrical repair shop and get them to remake all the dry joints on the main board and check replace any suspect electrolytics be warned though that isn't a quick job to do so if you don't get it repaired under warrantee you expect to pay a fair bit for the repair mind you as the tv was pretty cheap even if you do end out forking out it would still be quite reasonable  Circuit design Oscilloscope Capacitor plague Poker jargon Capacitor Audiophile Computer Television Bicycle lighting Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Action potential Color 2000 Australian Grand Prix Electronic amplifier Rail terminology Ethernet Impedance Electrophysiology Digital circuit Operational amplifier Service life CPU cache Microphone Central processing unit Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Cold fusion Gramophone record Microeconomics CPU design Theodicy Digital photography Hash table Windows XP IMac Cable television Loudspeaker Eye Procrastination Electric motor Cathode ray tube Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Telephone exchange Heinkel He 112 PlayStation Portable Diode Goodness and value theory Super Nintendo Entertainment System Fluorescent lamp Printed circuit board Apollo Guidance Computer Transistor Tesla coil Objective-C Sound Blaster Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Violin Friends Watch Pixel Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Information Technology Infrastructure Library Democracy Quicksort SCART Switched-mode power supply Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Transformer Gauge theory X10 (industry standard) Cray-1 GunZ The Duel Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Enterprise content management Trademark Nintendo Entertainment System Surveillance Dynamic random access memory Debugging PCB layout guidelines Analog-to-digital converter Thermal power station Bob and George History of computing hardware Plasma display Light-emitting diode The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Seismic retrofit

is the plasma better than lcd outward appearances are definitely deceiving when it comes to lcd and plasma televisions although both types of televisions are flat and thin they employ different technology in an attempt to deliver similar results plasma tv overview plasma television technology is based loosely on the fluorescent light bulb the display itself consists of cells within each cell two glass panels are separated by a narrow gap in which neon xenon gas is injected and sealed in plasma form during the manufacturing process the gas is electrically charged at specific intervals when the plasma set is in use the charged gas then strikes red green and blue phosphors thus creating a television image each group of red green and blue phosphors is called a pixel picture element although plasma television technology eliminate the need for the bulky picture tube and electron beam scanning of traditional televisions because it still employs the burning of phosphors to generate an image plasma televisions still suffer from some of the drawbacks of traditional televisions such as heat generation and screen burn of static images lcd tv overview lcd televisions on the other hand use a different technology see also question for this same explanation basically lcd panels are made of two layers of transparent material which are polarized and are glued together one of the layers is coated with a special polymer that holds the individual liquid crystals current is then passed through individual crystals which allow the crystals to pass or block light to create images lcd crystals do not produce their own light so an external light source such as florescent bulb is needed for the image created by the lcd to become visible to the viewer unlike standard crt and plasma televisions since there are no phosphors that light up less power is need for operation and the light source in an lcd television generates less heat than a plasma or traditional television also because of the nature of lcd technology there is no radiation emitted from the screen itself plasma television advantages for plasma televisions the advantages over lcd are better contrast ratio better ability to render deep blacks more color depth better motion tracking response time and more availability in very large screen sizes plasma television disadvantages however the disadvantages of plasma vs lcd include more susceptible to burn in although this is not as much of a factor now due to technology improvements in the past couple of years more heat generation does not perform as well at higher altitudes and shorter display life span although this too is changing due to technology improvements heavier weight and more delicate to ship lcd television advantages lcd television advantages include no burn in susceptibility cooler running less screen glare more functional at high altitudes longer display life although improvements are being made in plasma screen life looks better in brightly lit rooms also lcd televisions have made great strides in upping the ante in native pixel resolution with a growing number of sets offering a full p x display capability at affordable price levels in screen sizes ranging from inches and up on the other hand the number of plasma televisions offering p native pixel resolution are still few and far between as well as being more expensive in comparison to their lcd counterparts one factor to consider in favor of lcd over plasma at least for the near future is that if you are planning to purchase a blu ray disc hd dvd or upscaling dvd player lcd may be a more cost effective option as you can get a p lcd set from to inches at a lower price than and inch size plasma set that has p resolution one other factor to consider is that lcd televisions are typically lighter when comparing same screen sizes than their plasma counterparts making wall installation easier lcd television disadvantages lcd televisions do have drawbacks in several areas vs plasma televisions lower contrast ratio not as good rendering deep blacks not as good at tracking motion although this is improving and not as common in large screen sizes above inches although the number is growing also although lcd televisions do not suffer from burn in susceptibility it is possible that individual pixels on an lcd televisions can burn out causing small visible black or white dots to appear on the screen individual pixels cannot be repaired the whole screen would need to be replaced at that point if the individual pixel burnout becomes annoying to you finally lcd televisions are more expensive than an equivalent sized plasma television although the price gap is closing the mercury issue also one argument that plasma television manufacturers are making about lcd televisions is that they use mercury as part of the chemical makeup of the florescent lighting used to illuminate the screen surface however this is a red herring with regards to choosing a plasma television over an lcd television in lcd sets the amount of mercury used is not only small it never comes in contact with the user also keep in mind that most common high efficiency florescent lamps also use mercury mercury is one of the earth's elements its existence in nature is a part of natural processes and has both beneficial and non beneficial uses just as most other elements and chemical compounds you are probably in more danger eating fish that may contain traces of mercury a couple of times a week than watching touching or using an lcd tv also with the development of led lighting sources which is mercury free this issue will resolve itself in the years ahead lcd television and hdtv reception on the hdtv part of the equation most lcd televisions already have built in standard tv tuners hdtv tuners must usually be added externally but more are showing up as a standard feature while many plasmas are just monitors only and may require both external standard and hdtv tuners to receive television signals although more are beginning to include either ntsc and or both hdtv tuners this is definitely a point to check when making your buying decision as it will affect your budget my recommendation is to go to a dealer and really take a look carefully at several plasma and lcd televisions and compare the performance based on the above factors and narrow down your choices to one or two of both types and make your decision based on what type will give you the most pleasing image connection flexibility and fits your overall budget expectations however both flat panel plasma and lcd televisions are viable options for home theater and with prices continuing to come down and features and quality continuing to go up both types are quickly becoming a good value for consumers

my hd lpw rca tv after warming up goes to black stillhas sound and then comes back what could it be rca tech told me to replace the bulb i did it still does it when i first turn on in the morning it will run perfect for about two hours then it starts and continues about every minutes the fan powers down screen goes dark seconds later the picture comes back and looks beautiful minutes later the same please someone help i'm in biloxi ms and there are no tv repair places oh great no repair shops in biloxi well call rca and find the nearest town that has an rca authorized service center they can fix it but i doubt you can i suspect either an intermittant fan but i really think it's an intermittant thermosensor is opening up and shutting your lamp off then cooling down a bit and allowing it to relight the lamp the problem is you need a skilled tech to disassemble the light engine to the point you can get to the thermosensor that's like taking the heads off of a car engine if you know how to do it it's not hard but if you haven't it's hard to do it  Incandescent light bulb Fluorescent lamp Vacuum tube Dundas Square Lighting Toyota Prius Movie projector Electrodeless lamp USS Sea Devil (SS-400) Stage lighting Cannabis cultivation Future energy development Bicycle lighting Take That Bus models used in New York City Transit Drag racing Traffic light Gramophone record Compact fluorescent lamp Aladdin (1992 film) Headlight Terran (StarCraft) Waylon Jennings SR-71 Blackbird 2000 Australian Grand Prix Space Mountain New York Giants Rose (Doctor Who) Gliding Light-emitting diode Tag Heinkel He 100 Iditarod USS S-37 (SS-142) Radio controlled car Rolls-Royce Merlin Pebble bed reactor Chevrolet Corvair engine Mercury Atlas 6 USS Tunny (SS-282) Cleveland Browns Mainframe computer Carburetor Bob and George Tire 24 Hours of Le Mans USS Aylwin (DD-355) Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Shaggy dog story X10 (industry standard) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Disc brake Formula One regulations USS Thresher (SS-200) Automotive lighting Pop Will Eat Itself Thermal power station Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) USS Wichita (CA-45) Chrono Trigger The Inside USS Seadragon (SS-194) Digital photography HMV Liquid crystal display The Wedding Present First aid Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March USS Harder (SS-257) Protoss Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Wind power Galileo spacecraft Rotor machine IMac USS S-32 (SS-137) Paul Is Dead Nuclear power Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory USS S-35 (SS-140) Hard disk 2005 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament USS Waters (DD-115) USS S-30 (SS-135) Heinkel He 112 Marching band Ayrton Senna Screw Pinball Indianapolis 500 Embedded system IMAX Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Windows 2000 Nintendo Entertainment System Electric motor Mercury 4 Triage

hdtv vs computer monitor since hdtv is just a buzzword and actually just refers to resolution why is it so expensive for a television to have good resolution but not a computer monitor here is an example i have a regular run of the mill computer monitor i've had for about years when i hook my xbox to it i can get resolution that is higher than p but not quite i however all the televisions i see that are under k can only display p so basically any hdtv i buy for under k is a downgrade from my monitor yet i can buy a new monitor that can display higher than p for a couple hundred bucks so if computer monitors can display hd so easily and cheaply why do they charge an arm and a leg for a television to do that what is different between a television and computer monitor just for comparison my monitor is inches an hdtv that size is more expensive than my monitor and doesn't have as good of resolution why i guess no one really cares or understands what i'm saying since no answers i guess i should jump on the bandwagon and buy an hdtv when my monitor can do it better and cheaper because that is logical very strong and articulated argument tv tech man when you spell it out like that i can see where the extra cost is incurred thanks for your response all though i do think they inflate the cost a bit b c they get to use buzzwords like hdtv or full hd and so on well what are you missing in a computer monitor sound circuits input circuits and the tuner circuits you don't get a remote with your monitor do you what about all the choices in your menu your monitor is beginning to sound a little too basic in my book man you're missing a lot in a monitor all it does is produce a picture with only one type of connection on it it doesn't have circuits for hdmi component and s video and standard video either you can't hook up audio at all and there's no circuitry for digital audio or optical audio and talk about the lack of channels all you have is pc video you don't get channels on uhf band and on cable band and none of the digital sub channels you can't stand feet away from it and turn it on or off or change the brightness or width of the picture you can't select warm or cool color temperatures can't get closed captioning it comes up a little short in the entertainment world hook up your dvd player to the monitor hook up your ps or sony xbox oh you can't can you at least not without unplugging your computer no switchable inputs but you can hook up a computer to a tv if you read the instructions  Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Laserdisc SCART Digital photography Computer Atari 8-bit family Oscilloscope PlayStation Portable Xbox 360 Digital cinematography Xbox Video Nintendo GameCube PlayStation 3 Teletext High-Definition Multimedia Interface Compact disc Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Floppy disk Computer and video games Digital circuit MPEG-2 Digital television Analog-to-digital converter Central processing unit Amiga Original Amiga chipset Digital Visual Interface Nintendo Revolution Amstrad CPC Federal Standard 1037C Home cinema ATSC ATI Technologies TiVo Digital NTSC Transformer Digital-to-analog converter Modem 1080p Aspect ratio (image) Camcorder Liquid crystal display television TurboGrafx 16 Universal Serial Bus Gramophone record High fidelity Karaoke Atari ST Stereoscopy Plasma display 8 mm video format System/34 Musical Instrument Digital Interface PC Engine Computer display Sound Blaster Synthesizer Movie projector Cable television Loudspeaker Apple Macintosh Nintendo Entertainment System Bluetooth Solar cell Kenwood Electronics System/36 Pixel Closed captioning ZX Spectrum Sega Saturn CPU cache USB flash drive Electrophysiology MP3 Warez YUV PlayStation 2 Windows 2000 Videocassette recorder Dolby Digital Compact audio cassette Widescreen RGB color model

can you play a dvd on an hdtv using a pc and hdmi cable we recently bought an hdtv and i'm going to buy an hdmi cable do we need to buy an upconverter for watching movies or could we use one of our laptops instead which both have dvd players will a pc have lesser quality than watching the movie through an upconverter are there any special things we'd need to do to set the resolution with the pc thanks you will get the best picture by getting a dvi cable and connecting a dvi to hdmi adapter to hook it up to your tv you will also need to connect the sound to speakers or to a receiver seperately set your screen resolution to x which equals p and i find that watching with a pc on a hdmi connection gives better quality than an upconverting dvd player if you are using a program like windvd or something very smooth picture  Television DVD High-definition television Home cinema Digital Visual Interface High-Definition Multimedia Interface Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Digital television SCART Laserdisc High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection 1080p Widescreen British Sky Broadcasting TiVo Xbox ATSC Anamorphic widescreen Video Video Graphics Array PlayStation Portable PowerBook G4 MPEG-2 IPod Liquid crystal display television Dolby Laboratories Home Box Office Laptop Blu-ray Disc Karaoke Digital photography Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Motion picture rating system Dubbing (filmmaking) Digital cinematography Handheld game console Xbox 360 Computer and video games H.264/MPEG-4 AVC High fidelity PlayStation 3 NTSC Digital cinema Liquid crystal display Letterbox Musical Instrument Digital Interface Aspect ratio (image) ATI Technologies VHS Warez Anime Display resolution Super Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo Revolution Mystery Science Theater 3000 Video codec Bluetooth Desperate Housewives Sega Dreamcast Law & Order Game Boy Video CD SonicStage Mouse (computing) Amstrad CPC Sound Blaster DVD player HD DVD Movie projector PlayStation 2 Broadcast flag IBM PC compatible Back to the Future Graphics card Console game Videotape CTV television network Camcorder S-VHS Machinima TFT LCD Digital cable IEEE 802.11 Super Video CD Desktop computer VAIO Game Boy Advance Poker jargon Our Gang Atari ST Atari 8-bit family S__CAM Digital rights management Stereoscopy Anchor Quatermass and the Pit Showtime (television) StarChoice Digital video

my tv doesnt work and i need advice i think a powersurge may have affected my television i have a regular inch jvc tv that is only yrs old what could be the problem and how much would i be looking at to fix it tia well pete is the most correct while you only see one glass fuse in the tv there are several fusistors and microfuses that can open up to protect the power supply along with the horizontal output that can short and stop the tv from powering up throwing it away can cost more than the repair and having it diagnosed is a must if you plan on turning it into the insurance company for blown fuses you can look at about to power supply damage about same with horiz outputs insurance companies will look at the entire damage within your home as one event that means you pay the deductible first and any failures of electronic equipment within days to days of that time are covered by the lightning power surge clause of the contract they don't make you pay the deductible for every piece of equipment only the deductible for one event so yeah you have to have any equipment diagnosed by a tv audio appliance garage door repair company that fails within the next days to months  Insurance Fuse (electrical) Life insurance Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Oscilloscope Microeconomics Health insurance Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Transformer Auto insurance Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Videocassette recorder Wind power Uninterruptible power supply Welding Thermal power station Capacitor plague Year 2000 problem Wind turbine Transmitter JVC Circuit design Expert system Best Buy STS-61 Vacuum tube Sears Holdings Corporation Seismic retrofit Wal-Mart Battery (electricity) Reliability engineering Contract Inflation Mortgage Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Items in the Metroid series Electricity meter Screw United States Postal Service Unemployment Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Capital accumulation Carburetor De Lorean DMC-12 Gramophone record Floppy disk 2003 North America blackout Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Embedded system Glossary of firefighting equipment Nintendo Entertainment System Lightning Solar power 401(k) Information Technology Infrastructure Library Hybrid vehicle Chernobyl accident Incandescent light bulb Hurricane Katrina effects by region Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.

when a white flash appears on the tv why does the sound momentarily dip ok i have noticed a few times whilst watching tv that the sound dips when a white flash comes on tv especially in music videos i don't know whether it is to do with the tv itself but it's weird we have a toshiba crt tv approx years old excellent tv better sound and contrast than a sony bravia ok maybe huge but who cares it looks modern regards assuming you're using the tv speakers for sound white is the hardest color for a crt tv to produce and it puts the most stress on the power supply it's possible the sound is dipping because the power supply is being overtaxed and doesn't have enough power to drive the audio amplifier at the same volume try reducing the contrast white level on the tv to ease the stress on the power supply and see if the volume stays more consistent for help on video settings in the tv check out these two articles http www techlore com article how to use your television s video controls http www techlore com article how to adjust your picture using video test patterns  DVD Amstrad CPC Equine conformation Apple II family Television Cathode ray tube Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis NTSC Loudspeaker Sony Audio level compression Prank flash Movie projector Transistor Operational amplifier PlayStation Portable IPod Digital photography Laserdisc Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting MP3 Commodore 64 IBM PC compatible PlayStation 3 Liquid crystal display television Universal Serial Bus Computer and video games USB flash drive Audiophile IMac Home cinema Non-native pronunciations of English Analog-to-digital converter Waveform monitor Panasonic Domain Name System Wood Circuit breaker Hard disk Vacuum tube Personal computer Bluetooth Nintendo 64 Walkman Electronic organ Synthesizer HyperText Transfer Protocol Super Nintendo Entertainment System PowerBook Videocassette recorder Gamut Mixing console Transformer Plasma display Sega Saturn Original Amiga chipset Greek language "Weird Al" Yankovic Dynamic random access memory Apple IIGS Subwoofer Embedded system Prostate cancer Bass guitar DV Pac-Man Electric motor Professional video camera Sound card SMPTE color bars Sinclair Research Ltd Game Boy Sinclair ZX81 Audio system measurements Diesel engine Flash memory Stereophonic sound Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Uniform Resource Locator Carburetor Laptop Phonograph Slot machine Jet engine SCART Oceanic trench Camcorder Secure Digital card Grateful Dead Video game music Decibel Queen (band) Sega Dreamcast Digital audio player Electronic amplifier Sound effect Internet

a few questions about hdtv's and their supported resoulutions lets say you have a lcd tv with a supported resolution of p when your watching tv does that tv show p on screen or does p only apply to when you hook it up to a dvd player or gaming system another question to help me further understand this is what does that number mean p also what is the difference between p and i which is better p only works with games and hd dvd players i is for transmitted tv signals p is progressive scan it scans line line line i is interlaced scan it scans line line line does the whole picture then scans line line line that's why there's an odd field and an even field scanned both fields create one frame progressive's frame rate is the same as the interlaced frame rate the reason to split it into odd even fields is to transmit the signal rather than plug it in like a game or dvd better transmission capability less bandwidth or throughput neither one is actually better enough to see the difference but interlaced gives you some jaggies on circular objects like tires and balls but it does give you better hi speed smoothness in interlaced that's because it's creating semi pictures to progressive's full pictures the brain fills in the missing lines but you'd never know it  Interlace High-definition television Video Television NTSC ATSC Digital video Digital television Frame rate Video codec Telecine Broadcast television system Original Amiga chipset Federal Standard 1037C Ethernet Widescreen Digital Visual Interface 720p 1080i S__CAM DVD Deinterlacing Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Atari 8-bit family Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Stereoscopy Compact disc Nintendo GameCube Radio Antenna (radio) Movie projector H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Anamorphic widescreen Modem Universal Serial Bus Nintendo 64 Xbox Xbox 360 Bluetooth Football (soccer) Warez Digital cinema IS-95 Power line communication Musical Instrument Digital Interface Game Boy Magnetic resonance imaging Konica Minolta SETI Liquid crystal display television Liquid crystal display Video compression PlayStation Portable Electrophysiology Snooker Helical scan Fax Speed of light 1080p IEEE 802.11 Resident Evil 4 Windows Vista Telegraphy Refresh rate CPU cache VHS Items in the Metroid series John Logie Baird Bandwidth Phase-shift keying Oscilloscope Asynchronous Transfer Mode Microscopy Cable television Teletext Electric motor Gravity Newton's laws of motion Coriolis effect Faster-than-light Aspect ratio (image) Videotape Cathode ray tube Redundant array of independent disks Moir__ pattern Computed tomography Digital Luna 3 Surveyor 5

what is the refresh rate on a sony kdl v p lcd i'm looking for the refresh rate in hertz for example hz hz hz the reason i ask this is because i've heard that new lcd tvs have a hz refresh rate and i just bought this tv last month so i want to know if this tv has the hz refresh rate i'm concerned because i just spent on a tv and i hope it's future proof so if they make ps games or br movies that take advantage of a hz tv i'll be covered ok tv tech man so all tv broadcasts are fps but that's not the case with video games most games are fps but some games are fps and sony even claimed that the ps is capable of rendering games at fps lets say my tv has a hz refresh rate how will games running at fps or fps look on my tv will i experience screen tearing and blurriness reality check all signals will be sent to the tv at frames a second or hz the hz refresh rate occurs inside the tv it takes one frame of picture and sends it to the display times why because have you ever seen a fast moving picture on some of the older tvs the background gets blurred because so much information is being changed that the tv does a rough in of the entire picture first then fills in the details on its second pass now the tv has the chance to not only rough in the picture on the st pass it has more chances to fill in the details too before it has to rebuild another frame of video that means your tv will completely fill in the details and provide a sharp clear fully detailed frame of picture on each and every frame while the older ones might only get one chance to provide all the details in the first pass with fast moving pictures there is too much change to accomplish a fully detailed picture in the first pass it takes a couple passes that's why the new hz refresh rates are going to really sharpen up high speed action sony introduced motion flow to the consumer line this year in the higher end models xbr units have them and some of the other models too look at the manual the intro should tell you about this new refresh rate or check the specification page well i did it for you you have the wax f chassis and the motion flow technology is in the wax chassis but you have p which is the highest resolution panel on the market right now  High-definition television Frame rate Liquid crystal display television Movie projector Mouse (computing) First-person shooter NTSC Teletext Television Stereoscopy Super Nintendo Entertainment System Liquid crystal display Nintendo Virtual Boy Refresh rate PlayStation Portable Automatic number plate recognition Sega Saturn Motion capture Laserdisc Casting Light-emitting diode Computer display Xbox 360 Video Eye ATI Technologies Digital cinema Dynamic random access memory MP3 Atari 8-bit family Computer and video games Computer animation IBM PC compatible Apple Computer Interlace Original Amiga chipset History of computer and video games Poker jargon Machinima Camcorder Computer and video game genres Counter-Strike Windows Vista Movie camera Oscilloscope Cheating in Counter-Strike Cathode ray tube Natural Selection (computer game) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Deinterlacing Halo: Combat Evolved PowerBook MPEG-2 Telecine Blu-ray Disc TRS-80 Color Computer Compact disc Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting CPU cache Xbox Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sound Blaster Console game Nintendo S__CAM Internal ballistics 720p Thunder Force Radeon Light gun Web crawler Persistence of vision PAL Widescreen Digital television RISC Laptop Rendering (computer graphics) Sinclair ZX81 Computer role-playing game VHS Guilty Gear Sega Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Hard disk SCART Gameking Nintendo 64 National Weather Service Grand Theft Auto III

television please help it's a long story but someone put a magnet by the tv so now it looks green and purple where the magnet was is there any way to fix this without buying a new tv there's no need to go buy a new television no permanent damage to the tv has been caused by the presence of the magnet however it has temporarily magnetized the picture tube this is what is causing the color impurity in the picture all consumer grade televisions come with an electro magnetic coil that surrounds the picture tube when the tv is turned on for a moment that coil is energized making a buzz sound it's purpose is to de magnetize the picture tube if leaving the tv off for at least minutes and turning it back doesn't cause it to make a buzz sound meaning this electro magnetic coil or degaussing coil has just been energized and demagnetizes the picture tube does not fix the problem then it must be done externally by someone who knows how to demagnetize the picture tube if it's a tv or smaller just take it to a tv repair place and in less than seconds they could fix the problem if the tv is bigger and far too heavy to carry then you will need to have a tv repairman come to your home and do this second job for you just getting him in the door may cost for this second job you could buy a degaussing coil and do it yourself it's not difficult but if you do it wrong you could make it look worse but if done correctly it will look good again  Cathode ray tube Magnet Degaussing Naval mine Transformer Loudspeaker Gramophone record Second Battle of the Atlantic Fluorescent lamp Electric motor Tesla coil Electromagnet Thermal power station Circuit design Vacuum tube Oscilloscope Phonograph Microphone Computer Spacecraft propulsion Relay Mattress Hearing aid Laserdisc Tire Galileo spacecraft Automobile self starter Floppy disk The Midnight Sun Hard disk M60 machine gun Solar power Lightsaber Apollo 8 Welding Star Trek: First Contact Electricity meter Fusion power Digital photography Seismometer Magnetic cartridge Resistor Best Buy The Legend of Zelda series enemies Electrodeless lamp Linear particle accelerator Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Magnetic field Shaggy dog story Titanium Magnetic resonance imaging Diode Television Upholstery 8 mm video format Electric guitar USS Vestal (AR-4) Frogman The Time Machine Electrical generator Equine conformation Helium Wind turbine Light-emitting diode Neutrino Jumpstart 3rd Grade Windows XP Pittsburgh Steelers Items in the Metroid series Television commercial Magnetic levitation train Data remanence Amateur telescope making USS Tunny (SS-282) Bass guitar Inflation Space elevator Aurora (astronomy) Ionizing radiation M16 (rifle) Electromagnetism Transcranial magnetic stimulation Alternator Bob and George Technetium Movie projector Enriched uranium Guitar Mass driver Coil Debugging Wardenclyffe Tower Magnetism USS S-30 (SS-135) Apollo Guidance Computer GunZ The Duel Superconductivity Spin (physics) Serial London Underground

why do commercials get interrupted in commercial breaks sometimes commercials get interrupted a few seconds into or before it ends to show lower quality local commercials other times the local commercials themselves may get interrupted a second before it could actually end the local commercials are notable in espnews sometimes interrupting news and highlights for each day's sports news and always making the sports scores and news at the bottom disappear so the point is why do the local commercials interrupt commercials and sometimes television show footage is well hedgehog hint you're in the wrong forum this is the tv consumer electronic forum where most discussion is about tv electronic and operational problems what you want is the entertainment music tv forum where they discuss tv programing gossip and tantalizing intellectual non technical tv questions like yours try there and you'll probably get dozens of answers each more inane or silly than the others  ESPN Pardon the Interruption Whose Line Is It Anyway?

i used two splitters to split my internet to two tvs and one computer but now i have serious problems first i split the internet with a bi splitter one leads to one tv and the other cable leads to another bi splitter thing one leads to the computer and the second one leads to another tv the problem is that when i turn on the second tv i used to feel a wave come out from my computer monitor and i literally mean a wave like a electronic wave or something over time the wave has gotten weaker to where i cant feel it anymore the wave only comes out during the turning on of the second tv and doesnt continues while the tv is on im just wondering if the wave is dangerous to my health or not i only have analog cable am i splitting my cable incorrectly thanks for your time the wave is an electrostatic field created by the high voltage charging up the picture tubes it won't hurt you and it's really not important that you feel the wave most likely there is a resistance building up over time to soften the effects of the wave it doesn't hurt the units it's just good old aging occurring cable connections do not have any effect on the wave so don't worry about your hook ups  Diode Loudspeaker Cathode ray tube Circuit design Capacitor Oscilloscope Vacuum tube Action potential Transformer Television Digital Subscriber Line Welding Radio Volt Synthesizer Plasma display Tesla coil Transistor Impedance matching Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Hall effect Lightning Quantum mechanics Submarine communications cable Radiation hardening Electronics Speed of light Atomic Kitten Electrophysiology Liquid crystal display Universal Serial Bus Computer Electrical generator Battery (electricity) Transmission line Uninterruptible power supply High-voltage direct current Operational amplifier CMOS Fusor Carbon nanotube Ethernet Klystron tube SCART Modem Michelson-Morley experiment Electrostatics Electric motor Digital photography Photoelectric effect Light-emitting diode Particle accelerator Plasma (physics) Van de Graaff generator Microphone Antenna (radio) Floppy disk Spacecraft propulsion Piezoelectricity Electromagnetic radiation Cosmic Era technology S-Video Information Age Digital Visual Interface MOSFET Electric power transmission Electrostatic discharge Internet Nuclear fusion Electronic amplifier Voltmeter Determinism General relativity Seismometer Nickel-cadmium battery Corona discharge PlayStation Portable Items in the Metroid series Dimmer Debugging Computer and video games Windows XP Computer hardware Surveillance Digital television Aerial (dance move) Wind turbine Federal Standard 1037C Single-phase electric power Low-pass filter Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Wardenclyffe Tower RGB color model X-ray Prostate cancer Explosive material Special relativity

how do i find out who provides cable to my area i'm moving across the country and trying to set up an appointment to have cable installed but i've tried a whole bunch of cable companies and none provide service to the area shouldn't there be a list or something a kind of roundabout way to find out would be to use yahoo tv it lets you set up a personalized list of tv channel schedules for your area enter your new address and it should show you the list of tv service providers in the area then you can do a web search among the choices to get their phone number most areas have only a single choice for cable provider i'd be surprised if your choice was anything but comcast  Password Bluetooth Cable television Wi-Fi Comcast Yahoo!

why do hd channels have smaller screens for instance nbchd espnhd etc what is the reasoning for these channels having smaller screens i have a inch widescreen hdtv by smaller screens i mean you see black bars on the sides or the top and bottom of the visible screen sometimes the graphic hd is displayed on these bars are you sure that you have hd service and are tuning to the hd channels if that's not the problem check the display mode that you are using if people on the screen look tall and skinny then you're set at aspect ratio instead of the that hd uses or you're watching nba basketball there should be a setting to let you switch to i think this is a weak area in the hd system all this aspect ratio setting should be completely automatic based on some flag in the content  Television Widescreen High-definition television Pixel Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Anamorphic widescreen Computer display standard NTSC Letterbox Color Graphics Adapter ATSC Aspect ratio (image) Windows XP Teletext EIA-708 Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Oscilloscope Atari 8-bit family 1080p Game Boy Video Late Night with Conan O'Brien Display resolution Digital photography DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Sega Dreamcast Federal Standard 1037C Gamut TiVo Movie projector Halo 2 PlayStation Portable Gradius ZX Spectrum Air traffic control Windows 2000 Stereoscopy Super Mario Bros.

whats the best lcd tv for video games samsung has a game mode on many of their lcd tv's basically game mode turns off any processing that the tv does so that the picture is instantly transmitted from the game box to the screen processing can cause a delay which takes away from the game play i think samsung is the only manufacturer on the market that actually allows you to disable their video processing for the purpose of better game play  Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Liquid crystal display television Handheld game console Computer display TFT LCD IBM PC compatible Liquid crystal display Atari 8-bit family MSX Oscilloscope Television Game Boy Advance Windows XP Pixel Organic light-emitting diode Universal Serial Bus Sega Saturn PlayStation Portable Photography Stereoscopy Game Boy Sega Xbox Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo Digital photography IMac Random access memory High-definition television DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Spider-Man (games) Canon T90 Sega Dreamcast Commodore 64 Sinclair ZX81 Commodore International Metroid Prime: Hunters Guilty Gear Hard disk ZX Spectrum Blu-ray Disc Mouse (computing) TurboGrafx 16 Acorn Computers Nintendo DS Samsung Multiplayer ATI Technologies SCART Musical Instrument Digital Interface Amstrad CPC PowerBook Amstrad DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Game Boy Color SAM Coup__ RISC Atari ST Teletext Super Nintendo Entertainment System The Legend of Zelda series Xbox 360 Atari 2600 Interlace Commodore 128 Advance Wars: Dual Strike Computer role-playing game Computer and video games Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Amiga Color Graphics Adapter Radeon Modem Minesweeper (computer game) Laptop History of computer and video games Light-emitting diode Apple II family Pop'n Music Computer and video game genres Pac-Man Bally Astrocade Cyberspace Screensaver GunBound Palm OS Acorn Electron Konica Minolta Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Counter-Strike Gamut Gameking Terran (StarCraft) Digital Visual Interface Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Nintendo Virtual Boy Bubble Bobble Nintendo GameCube

how do u know if your tv is digital ready i heard by jan next year there will be no more free tv and if you dont have a digital ready tv you wont even be able to get cable has anyone else heard this im in chicago btw someone is giving you bad information after feb old tv's in the us will not be able to directly receive free over the air programs to receive programs you will need a digital to analog converter box these work similarly to cable boxes your antenna attaches to the input of the converter box another cable s runs from from the converter's output to your old tv vcr or dvd recorder the outputs on the converter box are like the ones typically found on vcr's starting in jan the us government is going to be giving out coupons to subsidize buying converter boxes the boxes are expected to cost about so the price after the coupon should be about each max per household it is very likely that the image quality you see coming through the converter box will be better than what you have been getting in the past so there isn't much reason to put off buying a converter after the coupons become available especially since the demand for the coupons will probably greatly exceed the amount of money that congress has allocated for the program cable satellite tv companies already convert tv signals to match the old type tv's they have a large financial incentive to keep providing signals to customers with older tv's ps beware of bs artists that say you must have a new digital antenna your old one will probably be just fine old type ota tv signals ntsc analog tv new type ota tv signals atsc digital tv dtv ota over the air stuff you get through your tv antenna except for certain low power and translator stations  Cable television Digital television High-definition television Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Satellite television SCART TiVo S__CAM Digital video recorder Bond NTSC Federal Communications Commission Laserdisc Antenna (radio) Loudspeaker Oscilloscope Modem DVD Communications satellite Digital cable Broadband Internet access Price discrimination Operational amplifier Electronics Transformer Terrestrial television VHS S-VHS Software-defined radio Set-top box Digital audio broadcasting Decibel MPEG-2 Privatization Videocassette recorder Gross domestic product Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Telephone exchange Broadcast television system Broadcasting Analog-to-digital converter Atari 2600 Electric guitar Solar power GSM services Wi-Fi ATSC Amateur radio Computer Audiophile Manitoba Hydro Transistor Digital-to-analog converter Digital photography United States Postal Service Video Television in Canada Inflation Telephone Insurance Global Positioning System Hard disk Microphone Arbitrage Radio Voice over IP Digital Satellite System Composite video BBC Synthesizer PAL Atari 8-bit family Electrophysiology 8 mm video format Dimmer Digital signal processing Television channel Capitalism Circuit design Impedance matching Copy protection Electric motor Dolby Laboratories Federal Standard 1037C Oil-for-Food Programme Wind power Credit card Hearing aid Health insurance FairTax

can a p hdtv pick up the signals on cable today hello answers community my outdated tv has recently broke and i've had to face the fact that i need to upgrade to an hdtv unfortunately me and my family aren't knowledgable on this area of electronics i have been told that p will be broadcast eventually but i don't understand why a better tv can pick up lower signals of hd is it just a matter of compatibility or can it really work and people did not want to tell me yes a p hdtv will usually accept all other signal formats then convert them to the tv's native resolution there are some tvs that will not accept p signals but will accept i if you're using a cable box or satellite receiver to receive you hd signals you may be able to set it's output to whatever signal format your tv accepts  High-definition television Television Digital television Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Cable television Xbox Satellite television Laserdisc DVD ATSC S__CAM Digital Visual Interface Widescreen TiVo Home Box Office Digital video recorder NTSC MPEG-2 RS-232 Teletext MP3 YUV Media in Canada Xbox 360 Broadcast television system Modem Oscilloscope SCART DVB Direct broadcast satellite Federal Standard 1037C Satellite dish Camcorder Communications satellite Low-noise block converter Atari 8-bit family Broadband Internet access British Sky Broadcasting Digital Satellite System Nintendo Revolution Musical Instrument Digital Interface Public Broadcasting Service 24 (television) Terrestrial television Video codec Pirate decryption DirecTV StarChoice Global Positioning System PlayStation Portable 1080i Floppy disk Law & Order ITU-T Set-top box Betacam KQED Digital cable Sound Blaster Optical fiber Windows Vista Radio clock Video Morse Code Ultra high frequency Liquid crystal display television PAL TV tuner card Audiophile Ethernet High-Definition Multimedia Interface Television licence Dolby Laboratories Light-emitting diode Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis VHS History of radar 1080p Electrophysiology Composite video Broadcast flag Phreaking DV Serial port Digital-to-analog converter Bluetooth Broadcasting Electronics Advanced Technology Attachment Voice over IP Sega Dreamcast Software-defined radio Anamorphic widescreen CFTO Atari ST Microphone Central processing unit The Late Show with David Letterman

which video standard is better nstc or pal i know some people say pal but to me it looks like the colors have a pastel tint to them pal's resolution was designed with more lines than ntsc plus it alternated the color phase degrees with every line isolating the color signal on each line no bleeding they probably over wash the subject with too much studio lighting that's why it is too pastel but pal came out in the late 's while ntsc color was designed in the 's whoever has the latest signal design has learned from previous designers that's why secam was better than pal so maybe in secam will come out with secam superhd and then we'll design the first d system only available on fiber optic cable years from now  PAL NTSC S__CAM Television Video High-definition television Atari 2600 Telecine Sega Saturn DVD VHS Broadcast television system MPEG-2 Sega Master System Digital photography Laserdisc Federal Standard 1037C Modem YUV Interlace DV 1080i Digital television Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Chroma subsampling Frame rate Nintendo Entertainment System Original Amiga chipset Commodore 64 Satellite television Closed captioning Nintendo GameCube Atari 8-bit family PC Engine Component video Compact disc RGB color model Computer display Jean-Michel Jarre Color space Color theory MOS Technology VIC-II 720p Digital cinematography Optical fiber Oscilloscope Single-sideband modulation DVB Television channel Xbox Digital video recorder Refresh rate DVD player Terrestrial television Super Video CD Ethernet Xbox 360 Pixel Digital cinema Color blindness Liquid crystal display television Dispersion (optics) Composite video Sega Dreamcast Color Radio Light-emitting diode Drawing Video Toaster PlayStation 2 SCART Videocassette recorder MOS Technology VIC Digital video Color temperature Movie camera Universal Serial Bus Nintendo DS Cable television Synchronous optical networking SMPTE color bars Polarization Camcorder Three-phase electric power HSV color space Glass Phonograph RS-232 S-VHS Broadband Internet access Lighting Sharp Zaurus Betacam TRS-80 Color Computer Handheld game console

can you change the dmd chip on a dlp screen from p to p i bought a p when the p's were way high in price and am wondering if i should have waited a few more months my question is if it is possible to change a samsung p to a p by replacing the dmd chip i was sitting around and thought this up but i havent been able to find anything to support my idea so if anybody is knowledgeable or knows whether or not its possible i would much appreciate it first off a dmd is nothing more than an array of tiny mirrors which are individually controlled to either reflect or not reflect light they are not measured by p or i or p or p they are measured the same way any digital display device is measured horizontal vs vertical pixels or in this case mirrors the video scaler is what you are talking about messing around with and it wouldn't make any difference whatsoever in any case the dmd chip is part of the dmd drive assembly which is matched to that specific chip there's a lot more than just the dmd chip in that assembly if you have a product capable of displaying p you are going to be just fine for quite a while there are no sources of video which require a higher resolution than that so to answer your question no it isn't possible to change out a dmd chip  DLP Digital Micromirror Device Digital photography Liquid crystal display Amstrad CPC Atari 8-bit family Light-emitting diode Sinclair ZX81 PlayStation 3 Radeon High-definition television Oscilloscope Atari ST Transistor Television Pixel Video Graphics Array Apple IIGS Xbox 360 Display resolution Nintendo 64 Laptop Radar Commodore 64 Plasma display IMac PC Engine Dynamic random access memory Hubble Space Telescope ATI Technologies TurboGrafx 16 Traffic light Xbox NTSC Nintendo Entertainment System IBM PC compatible Embedded system MSX CPU design Computer display Microeconomics Laserdisc Redundant array of independent disks Dots per inch Timeline of computing 1990-forward H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Digital cinematography ZX Spectrum Flash memory Digital camera Telescope MEMS Computer display standard Digital Visual Interface Stereoscopy PlayStation 2 Sega Saturn Mechanical television Computer ZigBee Overclocking Nintendo Revolution MOS Technology VIC-II Antenna (radio) Machine vision Charge-coupled device Digital Supply and demand NVIDIA Color Vacuum tube Commodore International CPU cache IPod Apple Computer Creative Zen Seismometer Teletext Bluetooth 2D computer graphics Intellivision Holography Graphics processing unit Integrated circuit Nintendo GameCube DVD Modchip Cathode ray tube System/34 MPEG-2 Slot machine

how can i change the video input on my insignia i have a insignia ns htv with a phillips universal remote pmdvr everything works fine on it except i cannot change to the video input on the tv with the remote nor is any option for it on the tv menu and on the tv it self is there anyway to get it to change cause i really dont want to shell out for the original remote if i dont need to when properly programmed the input on your tv will change when you do the following put the remote into tv mode by pressing tv near the upper left corner of the remote change the tv's input by pressing tv vcr dvr which is located about halfway down on the right side next to the if this does not change the inputs on your insignia tv you should try reprogramming the remote using an alternate code unfortunately insignia is not listed on the brands of tvs that this remote will operate so you'll just have to hope that some other brand's codes will work to reprogram your remote do the following turn on your tv press and hold the code search button until the red indicator stays lit release the code search button quickly press and release the tv mode button the red indicator blinks off once press channel up repeatedly until your tv changes channels the red indicator blinks each time you press the button if you overshoot a valid code press channel down to go back to the one that works press and release mute to install the code there may be more than one code that works for your tv so if the video input won't change with one code try to search for another code that may work instead there's a chance that your remote won't work with your insignia tv in this case you will either have to get the original remote more expensive option or get a different univeral remote that has codes specifically meant for insignia tvs  Mouse (computing) Pump It Up SCART Embedded system Traffic light HTML element System/36 Windows 2000 System/34 Macromedia Flash PlayStation Portable Atari 8-bit family DVD Oscilloscope Xbox 360 Remote control Windows XP Nintendo Entertainment System X Window System IPod Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Mozilla Firefox Konami Code Microsoft Windows Xbox X10 (industry standard) AmigaOS Nintendo DS Dance Dance Revolution Bluetooth Palm OS Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Beatmania IIDX ALGOL 68 Windows Vista Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting ITV Internet Relay Chat Danger Hiptop Guilty Gear Gmail Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Visual Basic Linux Slot machine Light-emitting diode DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Original Amiga chipset Compact disc PHP Resident Evil (video game) Minesweeper (computer game) Amstrad CPC Digital video recorder Common Unix Printing System DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution PlayStation 2 Poker jargon History of the graphical user interface Fischer Random Chess United States Postal Service Radio Debugging Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Vertical service code Computer Resident Evil 2 Sinclair ZX81 Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Burglar alarm Rank Insignia of the Galactic Empire Microsoft DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution TiVo Screenshot High-definition television Hello world program Ajax (programming) Gradius Unicode Floppy disk Apple Macintosh Morse Code S__CAM Shirt Laserdisc ZX Spectrum Television Modem Mac OS X Starfleet ranks and insignia Team Fortress Classic Double Dragon MS-DOS Nintendo Revolution Videocassette recorder

in a furnished basement would you go with lcd or plasma hd tv i want a p contast ratio large screen for my basement mostly for hd dvd's and xbox seeing how it is in a large room with no sunlight what is a better option i agree go lcd also you mentioned a contrast ratio here is a bit of information to explain how that is nothing more than a marketing tactic first of all it's necessary to understand the difference between the two types of contrast ratio measurements the one used by pretty much every manufacturer out there is full on white full off black while this can give some amazingly high numbers people don't watch all white or all black screens comparing the brightest whites in one scene to the blackest blacks in another scene is not representative of the picture quality available at the exact instance you're watching each scene the contrast ratio that matters most for the most common viewing scenarios is ansi contrast ratio with ansi contrast ratio the black and white levels are measured at the same time on the same screen using a square black and white checkerboard image what this means is that it is representative of the contrast ratio achievable at any one point in time this is what is really important the reason ansi contrast ratios are not published is because of marketing ansi contrast ratios are much lower than on off contrast ratios an ansi contrast ratio of would be an impressive result and would be outstanding but much too low of a number if casually compared to an on off contrast ratio of  Liquid crystal display Plasma display Television Digital photography Stereoscopy Decibel Light-emitting diode Loudspeaker Video Projection screen NTSC Contrast ratio Pixel Plasma (physics) Oscilloscope Solar cell Laserdisc High-definition television Labour economics Big Bang Common Lisp Gamut MP3 Anamorphic widescreen Color Laptop Entropy Sun Movie projector Nuclear fusion Nuclear magnetic resonance Prostate cancer Analog-to-digital converter White (people) Microeconomics Photography Wallpaper group Gross domestic product Solar power GoldenEye 007 Digital-to-analog converter Supply and demand Cinematography Watch Drawing Labor theory of value Basement EIA-708 PE ratio Widescreen PlayStation 2 Organic light-emitting diode E85 Transformer Welding Planetary nebula Binoculars Inflation IMac Sega Cathode ray tube Aspect ratio (image) Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Quark-gluon plasma Gameking Signal-to-noise ratio Mutual fund Level of measurement Hipparchus (astronomer) Human skin color Pan and scan Tide BASIC programming language Economic inequality Balassa-Samuelson effect Anchor Species Spacecraft propulsion Chess problem Supply-side economics Audiophile Central processing unit History of computer and video games Digital television Neutrino Archimedes Global climate model Motion picture rating system PlayStation 3 Law of value Eyepiece Electrophysiology DVD

does any one have the hdtv sony bravia kdl v need opinions i just bought a sony bravia last week and connected it to my ps i got the blu ray and the picture quality is really bad it looks extremely grainy on some scenes specially when there is a black background i have checked all settings and connected my tv in many different ways and get same results for the people who own this tv is this normal is this the actual image quality of the tv or do you think my tv has some sort of malfunction would appreciate some feedback i'm more concerned about the dvd discs or the games you're using i get the feeling you haven't actually tried anything other than low definition games or dvds the real test is with a blu ray dvd of a recent movie in hd like spiderman that's a good choice that dvd will let you know if there's something wrong with your dvd player or the tv set next if you have hd channels in your home try those channels and see if the tv is bad that will divide and conquer the problem because if your hd station looks grainy then the tv has to be at fault and not your dvd player  DVD Laserdisc Television Widescreen PlayStation Portable MP3 Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Blu-ray Disc Theory of conduct Digital rights management Movie projector Computer and video games Copy protection Software testing Warez Final Fantasy IX Prostate cancer Super Nintendo Entertainment System Video Anamorphic widescreen Sony Nintendo Revolution Nintendo GameCube McFly Audiophile Oscilloscope Family Guy High fidelity Video game controversy PlayStation 3 Monty Python and the Holy Grail MPEG-2 Poker jargon Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma ROM image I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue DualDisc Color MAME Resident Evil 2 Motion picture rating system Extreme Programming Nintendo Video CD Videotape Videocassette recorder Sky Digital Gramophone record Pornography Camcorder H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Cinematography Sony Pictures Entertainment Wheel of Fortune SCART Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Handheld game console Compact disc Sega Dreamcast Delta Goodrem Karaoke Home Box Office Xbox Digital cinema MMORPG Digital television Xbox 360 Gran Turismo (game) Unemployment Resident Evil: Apocalypse Final Fantasy VII DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Sony Computer Entertainment Floppy disk Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Stomach cancer Beatmania IIDX Resident Evil Goodness and value theory Spider-Man Mystery Science Theater 3000 NTSC Final Fantasy XI Modchip Late Night with Conan O'Brien TiVo Volleyball Infantilism Super Video CD MiniDisc Betting (poker) Cheating in Counter-Strike Fahrenheit 9/11

coax to rca adaptor i am considering buying a cheap tv but the coaxial input is broken i want to have it capable of watching cable on it is there a way to convert the cable line to go through the rca ports on the tv so that we can watch cable unfortunately not you would need a vcr or some device that can act as the tuner basically with the coax connection broken you also lose the tuner on the tv if you have a cable box then you can use rca jacks two for audio one for composite video to hook it into your tv alternatively you can try to get the coax replaced or repaired you can do it yourself if you are handy good luck  SCART Television RCA connector Cable television Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Ethernet Composite video Coaxial cable Atari ST IPod S-Video Nintendo Entertainment System Videocassette recorder Digital video recorder Universal Serial Bus Set-top box High fidelity Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis NTSC Composite monitor DVD S/PDIF Home cinema Jack plug TiVo High-definition television RCA PlayStation Portable Oscilloscope S__CAM Laserdisc Nintendo DS Amstrad CPC Xbox 360 Amiga Federal Communications Commission Musical Instrument Digital Interface Camcorder VHS Electric guitar Archos XLR connector S-VHS Synthesizer Commodore 64 Game Boy Advance Bluetooth Transformer Walkman Sound card Apple IIGS Karaoke Loudspeaker Light-emitting diode PC Engine TV tuner card Vacuum tube ABS-CBN TV game PAL HomePNA AT&T Impedance matching NBC D-subminiature Digital television Domestic AC power plugs and sockets SelectaVision PlayStation 2 Atari 8-bit family Cruising (maritime) Input impedance Teletext ITunes Harp Sega Dreamcast RS-232 Decibel Sound Blaster Telephone exchange Analog-to-digital converter Broadband Internet access FireWire Cable modem Satellite television MythTV Receiver (radio) American Broadcasting Company Atari 2600 Betacam Computer hardware Operational amplifier Vision mixer Handheld game console Dynamic random access memory Macrovision Compact disc

sharp lcd tv fuzzy picture with cable channels i just purchased aquos lc d u this lcd tv with regular cable channels the picture is really fuzzy straight out of the box is there anyway to tweak the picture so it is not so fuzzy with the channels well remember the fuzzy channels are going to disappear on february but these new tvs must be able to recieve the old signals until they disappear you might adjust the sharpness control down it's located in the video menu also if it has a noise reduction feature turn it on but don't expect miracles you have a high definition tv and that unit is converting the low definition signal into a usable signal for the hd circuitry in other words they take the picture apart and reassemble it into a signal that mimics the hd signal they call that line doubling so each line is written twice on the screen and that really makes the flaws in the low definition picture stand out when you get an hd picture on your tv set you will really appreciate the difference it is amazing try your dvd on it that is a major improvement right there  Oscilloscope Television Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting SCART Atari 8-bit family PlayStation Portable Stereoscopy Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Laserdisc DVD Fuzzy logic Mouse (computing) Loudspeaker NTSC Bluetooth Digital television RS-232 IMac Transformer Liquid crystal display Digital photography Original Amiga chipset TGV Plasma display Federal Standard 1037C S__CAM Universal Serial Bus Modem Decibel Teletext Digital circuit Home Box Office Operational amplifier Cable television Nintendo Entertainment System Electrophysiology Musical Instrument Digital Interface Widescreen MPEG-2 Light-emitting diode Freeview TV-FM DX Gameking Macrovision Amstrad CPC Aliasing Liquid crystal display television Antenna (radio) Electronics Remote control Railway signalling 8 mm video format VHS Diode Coaxial cable H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Audiophile Cray-1 Compact disc ATSC Drill bit TFT LCD High fidelity Super Nintendo Entertainment System Wind turbine Dynamic random access memory The Walt Disney Company MTV2 Windows XP Macromedia Flash Satellite television TiVo Textile manufacturing Analog signal Nintendo GameCube Analog-to-digital converter Camcorder A Course In Miracles ZX Spectrum Composite video Audio data compression IBM PC compatible Movie projector Telegraphy Cathode ray tube Digital-to-analog converter Computer IPod IEEE 802.11 Dolby Laboratories Karaoke Danger Hiptop Dimmer Sound recording Interlace Balanced audio

would like advice on best tv's to buy flat screen tv favoured the panasonic lx or lm anyone with experience of these or others please advise the panasonic tx lmd panasonic tx lxd are both very similiar tv's however the panasonic tx lmd is panasonic's entry level model so the panasonic tx lxd is buy a far a better model you maybe wondering why that's because the lxd series tv has a higher contrast ratio offering sharper images and a hz processor eliminates flicker and motion distortion the rrp price also helps difrentiate between the models  Digital photography Sound Blaster Television Leica Laserdisc 3DO Interactive Multiplayer Camcorder Radeon X Series Nintendo Revolution Stereoscopy Movie projector IMac Binoculars TRS-80 Floppy disk Microeconomics GeForce 6 Series Apple Computer Liquid crystal display DV Motorcycle Sega 32X Nintendo GameCube IBM PC compatible Mutual fund Electric guitar Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Loudspeaker MII (videocassette format) Mattress Atari 8-bit family NTSC Inflation Projection screen Super Nintendo Entertainment System Tesco PowerBook MIPS architecture Deflation (economics) Commodity Laptop Camera E85 Monopsony Free trade Public transport Windows Vista Panasonic Digital cinema Oscilloscope System/36 Deinterlacing Quizbowl PE ratio Law of value Speed of light Atari Lynx Data General Synthesizer Solar cell MSX Labor theory of value PlayStation 3 Medium format Manual transmission EMac Nickel metal hydride Smartphone Supply and demand Progressive tax Plasma display S__CAM Reel-to-reel audio tape recording High fidelity IPod Xbox 360 PowerPC Interlace Livewires Protectionism Persistence of vision Bass guitar Illegal drug trade Plasma (physics) Apple Macintosh Biodiesel RGB color model Sega Saturn Nintendo 64 MiniDisc 24p Wal-Mart Alcohol fuel Overclocking Game Boy Advance CPU design Central processing unit Pentium 4 Sharp Zaurus Computer animation

i'm curious why more people don't go projection with the price of projectors dropping and the quality already at the p level i'm confused as to why anyone would buy just a regular tv for times the price smaller screen and the same picture quality are people just not aware that projection is an option or do they think that the picture quality is bad or what i'm just wondering why more people don't do it weeder i guess i should have clarified front projection kyality that's all good but any tv less than you will not be able to tell a dif between p and p plus the only thing even broadcasting p is blue ray and hd dvd you can get a p pj for k which is the same if not less than a rear projection tv aman all valid points however i disagree with you regarding it as a regular tv we've been using it for years and it works exactly the same as a regular tv amaan with all due respect that is just not true after the initial setup granted the setup is more complicated but not that much and most people have separate sound anyway for surround we have one system in the living room in the bedroom and they all work just like regular tv you just turn in on and watch and we only have remote that works everything a few reasons why people don't choose projection more complicated setup a longer wire runs from sources to projector b must find a place to mount both the projector and the screen c projector location cannot have any obstructions between it and the screen d separate audio system is required because projector doesn't have built in speakers lamp in projector will burn out every few years and replacement can be costly not everyone wants a really large screen with its large image and lack of built in speakers casual tv watching is impossible with a projector even just watching the news in the morning has to be a big theater production cooling fan for projector's lamp makes noise some people would consider a screen on the wall even a retracting one ugly additional info a projector does not work exactly the same as a regular tv with a regular tv you can hook it up to nothing but power and the coax jack on the wall and be able to enjoy watching tv the tv by itself has everything necessary built in the screen the tuner the speakers are all in one box controlled by one remote and in one place that's conveniently located close to the power and cable outlets with a projection system not only do you need to set up the projector you need a separate screen the location of the projector most likely won't be convenient to the power and cable outlets so you'll have to install new ones or find a way to hide the long cable runs if the projector has a speaker built in not only would the sound be terrible because of the speaker's low quality but the sound would be coming from the wrong direction because that would be unacceptable to most people a separate audio system is required now just to watch basic tv you need to configure the projector the screen and the audio system unless you have a universal remote you're going to have at least remotes to mess with while it's still not terribly complex i assure you that a projection system is more complicated to set up and use than a basic tv in many ways they do not work exactly the same many people either don't have a surround sound system or those that do simply don't want to bother using it all the time i don't need my whole audio system on when i'm watching the news while i eat my breakfast an others are still sleeping sure some audio systems have a night mode that lessens the chance of waking people up but how is that any easier than just leaving the system off and just using the tv's built in speakers response to vicseo b while it may be convenient to put a projector on a coffee table it would still be ugly and inconvenient to run wires from a side wall to the middle of the room whether it's mounted or painted a screen on the wall is an added thing that isn't necessary with a conventional tv d ok so there are some projectors that have speakers so what shouldn't the sound be coming from somewhere in proximity to the screen not from the coffee table ceiling or somewhere behind the viewer just because it has a speaker doesn't mean anyone would want to use it whatever features or procedures are available to extend lamp life doesn't change the fact that a conventional tv doesn't require any of that because it doesn't have a lamp however long the lamp lasts it will eventually burn out and replacements aren't free even quiet fans make a bit of noise if it's sitting on the coffee table in front of you you're more likely to notice it ok so instead of an ugly screen on the wall you just have an ugly wall i don't see how that's any better  Movie projector

why are american tv broadcasts fuzzy and over saturated i live in the uk and for a while now ive wondered why the picture of some american broadcasts appears fuzzy over saturated and with generally poor quality when compared to native broadcasts its not everything series like and csi are crystal clear however things that are shot live in a studio like chat shows and news channels like fox and abc have noticably poor picture watching some footage today shown by bbc news but filmed by nbc i think about the bridge collapse in minesota the difference was very noticable does anyone know why this is because it is most likely a live feed directly from the u s and has to go through several transfers before arriving at your t v pre recorded broadcasts are sent over digitally to your local stations and broadcasts from there but live shows are sent directly from the us stations and relayed via several satellites with each transfer causing a decrease in quality  American Broadcasting Company Television in the United States Australian Broadcasting Corporation Television High-definition television BBC One BBC Cable television Television syndication NBC Fox Broadcasting Company Dish Network Communications satellite Digital audio broadcasting Sky Digital Fox News Public broadcasting Channel 4 WCCO Live Aid CSI: Crime Scene Investigation WWOR-TV WNBC-TV Lists of television channels Radio Telef__s __ireann Television in Canada Media in Canada Television network CBS News program BBC Television CNN NTSC KCAL-TV Digital photography KSTP-TV NFL on television BBC Radio Five Live Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Digital television News presenter Home Box Office WNEP-TV KSDK Prime Television TV-FM DX ABS-CBN Major League Baseball television contracts WTXF-TV Serial Satellite television The Today Show Sound recording WKYC-TV KYW-TV MSNBC Television channel Cartoon Network Studios BBC World Five (TV) BBC Northern Ireland International broadcasting Radio BBC Radio Dubbing (filmmaking) XM Satellite Radio Science fiction on television Freeview WUSA (TV) Saturday Night Live KHNL BBC News 24 Movie studio Sky Sports Timeline of the BBC 8 mm video format ANT1 Regional television in Australia Hubbard Broadcasting Corporation Media of the United Kingdom CBC Radio One Commercial broadcasting KARE KNXV-TV John F.

what does contrast ratio mean with respect to video the contrast ratio is the ratio of the measured intensities i e luminance measurement values for direct view displays and illuminance values for projection screens between the brightest white and the darkest black levels that a properly adjusted display system is capable of reproducing the higher the contrast ratio the better contrast ratio is a major determinant of perceived picture quality if a picture has high contrast ratio you will judge it to be sharper than a picture with lower contrast ratio even if the lower contrast picture has substantially more measurable resolution charles poynton unfortunately the contrast ratio specification is one of the more deceptive specifications much as microprocessor clock speeds were are and is regularly abused or misused by most display manufacturers there are two popular methods for measuring and specifying the contrast ratio of a display system the full on full off method which effectively measures the dynamic contrast capability of a display or image and the ansi now known as the iec contrast measurement which measures the static contrast capability of a display or image though far from perfect the iec ansi method can provide a somewhat better representation of a display s real world contrast performance it is also one of the few official standards that have been established for measuring the contrast capability of displays using the iec ansi method however produces results that are highly dependent on the testing environment unlike the full on full off method i would like to see manufacturers provide a minimum combination of contrast ratio specifications where applicable vesa fpdm full on full off and iec ansi specifications along with the test conditions that were used currently a level playing field does not exist when it comes to the contrast ratio specification because most consumer electronics manufacturers all too often allow their marketing departments to prevail when it comes to product specifications these same manufacturers seem intent on their unwillingness to fully comply with the recommended methods and practices being promulgated by standards organizations such as vesa iec iso etc nevertheless the video electronics standards association vesa has made very good progress with their flat panel display measurements standard fpdm which specifies soon to be different ways to measure contrast and hopefully responsible manufacturers will adopt such standards and practices when it comes to providing consumers useful and or meaningful product specifications you should also be aware that you can increase the ambient contrast ratio of a display by greatly controlling the level of light in your viewing environment using dark neutral colors on the surrounding walls within your field of view and most importantly properly adjusting the brightness black level and contrast or picture peak white level settings on your display in conjunction with optimizing your viewing environment or viewing conditions for more detailed information on this topic please be sure and read the first three references  Liquid crystal display Television Light-emitting diode Laserdisc MP3 Movie projector Explosive material C programming language Unicode Color Pixel NTSC C plus plus Stereoscopy Oscilloscope CIE 1931 color space Computer Plasma display Microeconomics Projection screen DVD H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Loudspeaker Light pollution Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Welding Radar Inflation Windows 2000 E85 Decibel Bicycle lighting Video High-definition television Software testing Lighting Fuel injection XML Solar cell SQL ISO/IEC 8859 Microscopy Supply and demand Carburetor Gamut Diamond Analog-to-digital converter Organic farming Central processing unit Reliability engineering Jet engine International Organization for Standardization Contrast ratio Liquid crystal display television Electric motor PlayStation Portable Ada programming language X Window System PNG Nuclear magnetic resonance Atari 8-bit family Turbocharger Eyepiece Transistor Datatype Antenna (radio) Object-oriented programming MPEG-2 Color space Credit card Extreme Programming Intelligence quotient Windows Vista Widescreen Law of value Photography Digital circuit Konica Minolta Insurance Binary prefix Enterprise content management Information warfare Mouse (computing) Computer-aided design IBM PC compatible Wind turbine Binoculars Measurement Computer display standard

lcd or plasma what's the difference between lcd and plasma lcd tvs versus plasma tvs comparison plasma televisions lcd televisions advantage screen size screen sizes range from inches to inches larger plasmas like a inch unit from panasonic are in production but are still prohibitively expensive for consumer use sizes range from inches to inches as with plasma there are larger lcd tvs made like a inch display recently released by lg but they are not readily available or affordable at the consumer level plasma tvs are the current size champions particularly when comparing tvs that consumers can easily purchase lcds are catching up in size with their developing technology however and may surpass plasmas in the near future this may be due to difficulties in producing glass large enough for larger plasmas viewing angle up to up to lcd tvs have the advantage here but by a small margin your viewing experience is not going to be ideal at or degree angles lcd tvs used to have a problem in this area primarily because lcds were originally used as single person computer monitors screen refresh rates plasma displays refresh and handle rapid movements in video about as well as crt televisions lcd tvs were originally designed for data display and not video therefore refresh rates had to be improved lcd tvs with refresh rates below ms or lower ms show very few noticeable artifacts lcd tvs are now available with refresh rates as low as ms slight edge to plasma technology burn in or stuck pixels plasma tvs can suffer from burn in produced by static images after extended periods stationary images burn in and produce an after image ghost which remains permanently on the screen with technologies such as 'pixel orbitor ' new plasma tvs have addressed burn in and significantly reduced the issues of older models lcd tvs do not suffer from burn in but can have a retained pixel charge which may also produce ghosting stuck pixels are also possible with an lcd display with the latest plasma technology this is less of an issue than ever before pixel orbitor for example is one method of reducing burn in used by plasma manufacturers it requires no additional programing from the end user as some older burn in prevention techniques did if you plan to use a plasma for gaming some games with permanent 'dashboards' may still cause some burn in check user manuals for available solutions by model product life span plasma tvs have a reported half life of to hours half life is the time it takes the lamp to fade to half its original brightness lcd tvs also have replaceable backlights but the expense of replacing one when the time comes may be greater than simply replacing the entire tv both plasma and lcd technology should more than adequately satisfy most consumers the average crt tv the kind most of us have at home has a half life of around hours if the average american household watches an average of four to six hours of television a day even a hour lamp would give you over years of use by then you'll be enjoying your new 'holodeck ' weight plasma displays are fairly heavy and may need additional supports to be mounted onto a wall lcd tvs weigh less than comparably sized plasma tvs lcd tvs are considerably lighter more portable and cheaper to ship durability plasmas are very fragile making them tricky to ship and install unlike the commercials where plasmas are mounted on the ceiling plasmas are best installed by a professional and should be installed on a wall that can bear a good deal of weight much more durable than plasmas end users can easily mount an lcd tv themselves if desired lcd tvs are far less fragile than plasmas shipping due to their fragile nature plasma tvs need to be shipped by specialty carriers overnight or fast delivery options are not recommended special shipping methods and their heavier weight add to higher shipping costs shipping lcd tvs is not difficult and is not as expensive as shipping plasma displays lcd tvs are lighter and far less fragile than plasma displays making shipping easier and less expensive installation plasmas are heavier use more power and run hotter than lcd tvs and therefore require more planning when mounting them plasmas are generally best installed by professionals end users can easily install lcd tvs themselves or can use them just as they use a traditional tv using a stand lcd tvs are much easier to install than plasma tvs brightness contrast plasma tvs report higher brightness and contrast levels than lcds under ideal conditions no ambient light this is a true advantage of plasma technology because lcd tvs are backlit and therefore light must be blocked to create blacks plasmas have individual pixels that either on or off creating deeper blacks and better contrast lcd tvs can often look better in 'real world' situations plasmas are made with a special glass surface that can reflect light which dulls the brightness and contrast of the image lcd tvs reflect very little light allowing them to maintain levels in well lit rooms both lcd and plasma tvs will meet the brightness expectations of most consumers however in 'real world' situations with ambient light lcd tvs will generally look a little brighter thickness as thin as inches deep as thin as inches deep lcds tvs are just a bit thinner performance at high altitude high altitudes can affect the performance of plasma displays because the gas held inside each pixel is stressed and has to work harder to perform some manufacturers make plasmas that are specifically designed for high altitudes but they may be priced higher than standard models lcd tvs are not affected by high altitudes lcd tvs  Hypoglycemia Mattress Xbox 360

widescreen size question i was thinking of getting a '' widescreen lcd but out local cable company and local channels only show programs in regular format i am currently using a '' regular tv if i go with the '' that means i would be looking at a smaller size if i watch it in the regual format right is small no matter how you cut it i tried buying one but it was just too small to justify spending money on an lcd in the first place i went back and got a which is remarkably bigger than a although mathmatically not so much it just seems so much bigger how big is the room you are using to watch the tv how far away from it will you be sitting i would recommend nothing smaller than a  Television Channel 4 Widescreen Cable television MTV Liquid crystal display CTV television network UKTV Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Anamorphic widescreen Mathematics Pixel ABS-CBN Digital television Whose Line Is It Anyway?

are plasma tv sets worth buying seems fewer and fewer companies are making them and more lcd's are being made are plasmas being phased out and are they a outdated product i think they are much better overall in comparison to lcd's they are much better than lcds and also cost a bit more to make many companys are not making much plasma units because there are a few companys that have already prefected them the leader in the plasmas are the pioneer they only specialize in plasma units hitachi and panasonic also make wonderful units at a reasonable price also sony used to do plasmas but have gotten away from it and perfected the lcd line and sony is the leading company that has the best picture best support and overall longest reliability than any other company  Panasonic Plasma display Liquid crystal display Television Liquid crystal display television Sega Saturn Handheld game console High-definition television Blu-ray Disc PlayStation Portable Sega Sony Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting MSX Digital photography Konica Minolta Cathode ray tube Fusion power Videotape IMac Laptop TFT LCD JVC Columbia Pictures Nintendo Hitachi, Ltd.

fixing hitachi tv convergence problem which resistor s to replace http answers yahoo com question index ylt aph lvi k pycpuni f bty ix qid aabihsm i originally posted a question on how to fix a hitachi tv convergence problem i got to removing and replacing the ic but now i am unsure which resistors to replace the kit i purchased came with several fusible resistors axial ranging from ohms which ones do i need to replace and i do i find them the kit should have a pictorial of the ics and the locations of each resistors unless yours is bootleg watch out there are after market knock offs that dont last very long you need an ohm meter and need to check each one usually the resistors dont need replacing but check to see if any look burnt go ahead and put it together and turn it on and see if its still out of wack if so go to menu and try to adjust the convergence if most of the colors will move into the crosshair except then a resistor is out in that circuit ie red wont converge but blue will go to red circuit near convergence amps and check all resistors hope that helps  Resistor Circuit design Electrophysiology Action potential Ethernet Operational amplifier Series and parallel circuits IPod Intellivision DVD SCSI Impedance matching Electronic amplifier Nintendo Entertainment System Potentiometer Galvanometer Transformer Voltage source CPU cache Atari 8-bit family Quizbowl Atomic Kitten System/36 Impedance Canon T90 Electronic color code Volt RLC circuit Electrical network Series (mathematics) View camera Inflation Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Analysis of resistive circuits Analog computer Hard disk Current source Commodore 64 Current (electricity) Photoresistor RC circuit Random walk Heathkit HyperText Transfer Protocol Eye Electrical element Thermistor Circuit diagram Oscilloscope System/34 Inkjet printer Windows XP STS-61 Fuse (electrical) Electrical resistance Capacitor Enterprise content management Motorola 68000 Airport Sinclair ZX81 E85 Loudspeaker Sega Saturn Transmission line Opportunity rover Bass guitar Quantitative marketing research Photography Ordinary differential equation Toyota Prius STS-59 Transistor-transistor logic CPU design Logic gate Legal research Convergence of Fourier series Wind power Vacuum tube Circuit breaker M60 machine gun Negligible Battlefield 2 Genetic algorithm Lighting Railway signal GunZ The Duel Monetary policy Electronics Macromedia Flash Bicycle lighting Texas hold 'em Heinkel He 100 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Poker jargon Google Table saw Jet engine

daewoo dc television help hi i need some help if anyone is a tv expert or has had the same problem i have a daewoo dc dsl d lcd television i've had it for around months now every so often the tv would make a pop kind of noise and then turn off usually unplugging it and turning it back on again would resolve it but the other day when i was watching a dvd it did it and now will not turn back on i've tried the fuse and checked that the gang lead i was using was fine and they all were but the tv is still dead anyone any ideas whats gone wrong and how to solve it thanks ps the tv uses an adapter like halfway between the plug socket and the tv connection point only mentioning this because my dad thinks its a bit odd send it to an authorized service center for repair if it is the tv or the power supply in the cord it needs to be checked and repaired why if it is the power supply it is probably because something is wrong with the tv and why buy a new power supply from them if the tv is going to break it again  Domestic AC power plugs and sockets BS 1363 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Windows XP Universal Serial Bus Fuse (electrical) Digital Subscriber Line Modem Telephone exchange Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Thermal power station Friends Escape from New York Jack plug Electrical wiring (UK) Hey Jude Europlug Error correction and detection Laptop Television Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Residual-current device Liquid crystal display Power strip Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting SCART Poker jargon Shaggy dog story Good Times Super Android 17 Saga Domain-specific programming language Public-key cryptography Oscilloscope Earthing system Broadband Internet access Screw CPU cache Power cord Theory of conduct GM Daewoo Capacitor plague Tire X10 (industry standard) D-subminiature Nintendo Entertainment System Surveillance String theory Hamming code Watch Futurama (TV series - season 5) Time travel Back to the Future The Ashlee Simpson Show Microeconomics R46 (New York City Subway car) Daewoo IPod Death Comes to Time Epistemology U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 STS-61 Cerebellum Operation Petticoat Screenwriting Game Boy Advance Rodney McKay The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Extension Cord AppleTalk Personal computer Undergrads Transformer Asynchronous Transfer Mode Live Aid Cathode ray tube Theodicy Wire wrap Conspiracy (TNG episode) The Daleks' Master Plan PlayStation Portable Ethics USS Vestal (AR-4) Canon T90 EastEnders 11001001 (TNG episode) John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Wallace and Gromit Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Carburetor Electricity meter Keynesian economics Expert system Jumpstart 3rd Grade Protoss Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Battle of the Bulge USB flash drive Integrated Services Digital Network Stem cell

will basic cable be atsc i have time warner basic cable no cable box just a coax into the tv in will the basic cable channels switch to atsc or will they stay ntsc i have a few old ntsc tvs that work and i'd like to use them with basic cable for many years to come thanks i think ken's answer is unfairly downrated but anyway your cable companies may choose to continue providing some signals in analog but not indefinitely they would convert the digital tv content to analog for people with analog cable there is far too much ignorance out there about the dtv switchover and cable companies will be reluctant to alienate the millions of clueless people who only know that their tv has gone away and will be flooding customer support lines government and industry have done an abysmal job of communicating the extent of the coming dtv changes maybe that's why the switchover date is feb just after a new administration takes office let them take the flak  Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting ATSC Cable television NTSC Xbox S__CAM Satellite television Federal Communications Commission Digital Satellite System Broadcast television system ITV MPEG-2 SCART Digital video recorder Analog signal TiVo DVB High-Definition Multimedia Interface Dolby Laboratories Integrated Services Digital Network 8VSB Digital terrestrial television Video Ethernet PlayStation Portable Telephone exchange Xbox 360 Laserdisc Set-top box Home Box Office Television in Canada Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Oscilloscope Freeview Federal Standard 1037C Telephone Time Warner Media of the United States Alabama Public Television Media in Canada Digital Subscriber Line Original Amiga chipset Rogers Communications Atari 8-bit family Electronic program guide KQED Atari 2600 Television in the United States Commodore International RS-232 Manitoba Hydro Commercial broadcasting NEC Corporation Digital photography Direct marketing T-carrier Acorn Computers ITU-T SMPTE time code GSM services Datacasting America Online Teletext Public-access television Telegraphy BBC Coaxial cable TBS (TV network) Bluetooth Broadband Internet access NTL Public Switched Telephone Network British Sky Broadcasting Audiophile Compact disc Terrestrial television Communications satellite Chorus Communications Must-carry Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Dolby Digital Optus Television Rogers Cable Inc.

i just watched on blu ray last night on a hd tv and was wondering whats the deal with blu ray and hd dvd's i could not notice a real difference in the picture compred to dvd's are these more expensive discs even worth it oh they are very worth it was made to look grainy so that's not a good demo disc some movies on blu ray are also made before digital so there's still a little grain but blu ray has much more space allowing the colors to be richer and the image to be times better in clarity then standard dvd you should try watching pirates or especially on blu ray to see the difference  Blu-ray Disc Laserdisc Widescreen DVD Compact disc PlayStation Portable Television Gramophone record Stereoscopy High-definition television Digital photography Warez Nintendo GameCube Anamorphic widescreen Movie projector Technicolor Color PlayStation 2 Sega Dreamcast Microeconomics Astronomical seeing Xbox 360 Video CD Video Film speed Videocassette recorder Blu Cantrell Nintendo 64 Back to the Future trilogy Digital cinema MPEG-2 Super Video CD Film Handheld game console The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film) NTSC Video codec Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Commodore 64 PlayStation 3 MP3 The Ultimate Matrix Collection DualDisc High fidelity CD-ROM CD recorder CD-R H.264/MPEG-4 AVC PAL DVD recorder VHS Babylon 5 Samuel Vimes 8 mm video format Tax Computer animation Game Boy Drill bit The Hand That Feeds Atari 8-bit family Copy protection Telecine Observational astronomy JPEG Super Audio CD Dolby Laboratories Brewery Cinematography Aliasing Popeye Enterprise content management Disc jockey Adobe Photoshop Hard disk Digital video Disk image Titanic (1997 film) Camcorder Nintendo Indiana Jones Weezer Movie studio Film colorization Marillion Resident Evil: Apocalypse Hyperinflation Pornography Eminem Digital rights management United States dollar Motion picture rating system Dither Inflation GP32 Transformers: The Movie Film preservation Video game music Signal (information theory) Blockbuster Video

help with complaint about quality of television now outside warranty i have purchased a lcd television about months ago this product became faulty with the warrenty period but due to a heavy workload and the fact i was told that this may be something that happens with lcd televisions and can go with time the retailer are refusing to look into the matter as it is now outside the warrenty period but i have been told that if you purchase something like a television then you are right to expect it to last a resonible period of time years and anything less than that should be resolved by the retailer can anyone help the workload isn't the fault of the manufacturer you should have taken a sick day and got the tv fixed under manufacture's warranty so why are you dealing with the retailer they didn't build or warranty this tv your only choice right now is to repair it or replace it why because the lemon law does not apply you must have the same exact part fail times in a row for it to apply to your tv and to expect it to last years now that's a gray law fruit last years candles you see where i'm going listen it is your responsibility to contact an authorized service center it's not the retailer's job and why did you listen to their hoo haa about the tv it's normal most tv's do that spit fire and pee on the carpet normal you would have known whether it was right or not now contact the manufacturer directly and tell them your tv failed months outside of warranty and you are really unhappy it didn't last longer they may make concessions to keep you as a customer but do it at the beginning of the month as they are given so much money per month to make customers happy and when they run out you get the robotic i can't help you answer keep calling until you do get a concession do it weekly keep your purchase reciept without it you get nothing and remember it is your responsibility nobody else's  Warranty Grey market Product liability Plame affair Liquid crystal display Trademark Wal-Mart IBM PC compatible Retailer Implied warranty Microeconomics Sears Holdings Corporation Air New Zealand Call centre Parliament of the United Kingdom Nintendo Telephone exchange Inflation Land Rover Bob and George Relationship marketing Contract Nintendo Entertainment System Western Digital Information Technology Infrastructure Library Oscilloscope UK Singles Chart Game programming Overclocking Citigroup IMac London Congestion Charge Outsourcing Theory of conduct Television SCO-Linux controversies Best Buy Value added tax Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Bulk vending Oakland Athletics Probability Software testing Business process reengineering ISO 9000 Social rule ITunes $ale of the Century Divorce Loss leader Windows 2000 EastEnders Mattress The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Sinclair Research Ltd Mediation Windows XP Internet fraud Annuity John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Hubble Space Telescope Billboard Hot 100 The Price Is Right Censorship in Australia The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Economy of Pakistan Insurance Abortion debate Friends Software engineering AMD Rent (musical) Steam (content delivery) Xbox Inventory The Star Wars Holiday Special Sales Second Battle of the Atlantic Quality control FairTax Electronic commerce Babylonian law Family Feud Illegal drug trade Watch The Apprentice 2 Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act 3dfx Economics Year 2000 problem Ethical consumerism Tax Gross domestic product Direct marketing Airsoft Extreme Programming Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis

how to hookup tv cable box vcr dvd cinema system that all depends on what connections you have available basically you want to use the best inputs possible to your tv in terms of signal quality the connections available in order are hdmi best component video s video composite video rf coax cable worst you want to connect the device with the best picture quality dvd to the tv using the best signal you can so if both player and tv have hdmi use that otherwise use component i ran out of inputs on my tv before i ran out of things to connect to it so what i ended up doing was running the output of my vcr into the input of my dvd recorder and connecting the dvd recorder to my tv using component video this causes some loss in signal quality but the vhs quality is so crappy compared to the other inputs i didn't really care the video switches you're likely to find for any reasonable price will only switch composite analog video signals and so are not the best for today's high quality video signals  SCART DVD Laserdisc Television S-VHS Composite video VHS Camcorder Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Videocassette recorder Cable television RCA connector Home cinema S__CAM Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Digital video recorder S-Video Videotape PlayStation Portable 8 mm video format Central processing unit Video codec Loudspeaker Ethernet High fidelity Oscilloscope NTSC DVD recorder Transformer Digital circuit Macrovision YUV Electronic amplifier Atari 2600 Computer Digital Visual Interface Analog-to-digital converter Operational amplifier Atari 8-bit family Xbox 360 DVD player PAL Input impedance Nintendo GameCube PlayStation 3 TiVo Dolby Laboratories Betacam Nintendo Entertainment System Compact disc Video High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection Digital television Synthesizer Copy protection Field-programmable gate array Karaoke Anamorphic widescreen Digital Betamax Composite monitor MPEG-2 High-Definition Multimedia Interface Programmable logic controller Frequency modulation Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Video CD Repeater Modem Rail terminology Phonograph Super Nintendo Entertainment System Film Circuit design Warez Sound Blaster Jack plug Coaxial cable Telephone exchange Analog hole Computer hardware XLR connector IPod Digital-to-analog converter Capacitor Electronics Electric guitar Transistor Component video Atari ST System analysis

rca tv makes squealing noise won't turn on i have an rca tv model number f which won't turn on and when it's plugged in it makes a squealing noise nothing happens when pressing the power button does anyone have any idea what might be causing this the horizontal output is shorted the squealing is caused by the power supply attempting to drive the shorted output if you cut the collector of the shorted horiz output then you can turn it on and it shouldn't squeal if it still does then the horiz output also took out the volt power supply rectifier the horiz output is normally mounted on a metal heatsink near the black box with the red wire connected to the top of the picture tube the collector is the middle pin on the transistor you can cut it using a diagonal wire cutter found at sears or lowe's or home depot in the tools section do not have the tv plugged in when you cut it then plug it in after the collector pin has been cut turn it on for a tech it's a simple fix and would cost you about to if the rectifier is shorted  Operational amplifier Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Transistor Diode Oscilloscope Vacuum tube CMOS SCART Nintendo Entertainment System Electric motor Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets IPod Gramophone record Computer Universal Serial Bus Electronic amplifier Jack plug Loudspeaker Commodore 64 Circuit design Digital circuit Welding Lathe Drill bit Solar power Linear regulator Incandescent light bulb Voltage regulator Fuse (electrical) Xbox 360 BS 1363 Switch Laserdisc Overhead lines Gas metal arc welding Atari ST Switched-mode power supply Mouse (computing) Current source Residual-current device Diesel engine Screw Three-phase electric power Fluorescent lamp Atari 8-bit family Logic gate Mercury arc valve Wire wrap Thermal power station Barbed wire Radio controlled airplane X10 (industry standard) D-subminiature Semiconductor device Integrated circuit MOSFET RCA connector Electrical generator Sega Saturn Personal computer Embedded system Hearing aid Electricity meter Tire Model aircraft RS-232 Seismic retrofit Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Microeconomics USB flash drive Amstrad CPC Field-programmable gate array Kenwood Electronics Microphone Uninterruptible power supply Laptop Capacitor plague Battery (electricity) Lightsaber Wind power Surface-mount technology Analog-to-digital converter Electronics Spark plug Seismometer Commodore C64 Games System Relay Variable Frequency Drive

why do some lcd tvs have component input i have xbox and ive seen lcd tvs without hd that have component input i thought component was only for hd and if i plug my xbox using the component cables to a non hd lcd would the picture be better than regular video component is a video connection standard that has been around even before the first hdtv was ever sold component video is most often used for hd connections but it is also used as a high quality analog connection on some gear it will give you a noticeable improvement in image quality over composite video and a slight improvement over s video with i sources  Television High-definition television Xbox 360 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Liquid crystal display Digital Visual Interface Laserdisc DVD Digital television PlayStation Portable Sega Dreamcast Liquid crystal display television Nintendo GameCube Widescreen S-Video Game Boy PlayStation 3 Oscilloscope Composite video Universal Serial Bus Archos Nintendo Entertainment System RCA connector Nintendo Revolution Atari 8-bit family Handheld game console Game Boy Advance Video codec S-VHS Digital photography Video Spider-Man (games) Impedance Plasma display Pixel Bluetooth Audiophile ATSC Camcorder Video game console Sega Game controller Cable television Light-emitting diode Nintendo DS Sega Saturn Laptop IMac YUV Component video NTSC Input impedance History of computer and video games Videotape PlayStation 2 Gamut Konica Minolta Digital video recorder TFT LCD Nintendo Original Amiga chipset Movie projector Enterprise content management Digital cinematography NVIDIA IPod Operational amplifier Loudspeaker Digital video Warez Nominal impedance XLR connector ATI Technologies 1080p Computer and video games Watch Super Nintendo Entertainment System Computer hardware Modchip Console game VHS Image processing Commodore International 8 mm video format Graphics card Battery electric vehicle Jack plug Synthesizer Digital camera RGB color model Aliasing JPEG Surface-mount technology Game programming Intellivision LCD projector Home cinema

can't get a clear picture on the television i currently have a basic satellite package with dish network i'm considering cancelling the service completely because it's expensive and the majority of shows that my family likes to watch come on the regular television channels problem we don't seem to get a clear picture unless we have cable or satellite of some sort everything is really fuzzy and there's shadows and sometimes even a slight static noise in the background why is this is there anything that we can do to resolve maybe something that we can purchase and attach to the television or an antenna on top of the house if you have a serious answer please be specific as i'm a bit of an idiot when it comes to things like this to drop the dish get an antenna installed at least feet off the ground on a secure mounting location check local laws or home owner rules first use guy wires if it is feet off the ground or more make sure they install a lightning arrestor and ground that properly with a copper or galvanized steel rod in the ground make sure to orient it toward the most local stations or if they are in different directions ask about an antenna rotor or dual antennas and a combiner in fringe locations more than miles from the transmitters get a really good antenna it is better to buy one that exceeds the distance rating because over the year life span maximum time to replace unless damaged by winds it will work better when you do replace it always replace antenna lightning arrestor and cable coax so as to keep these critical parts new enough to do the job if you live in the united states prepare for purchasing a digital over the air tv atsc converter box in the next year or so see this web site for more details as analog tv ends in http www dtv gov  Digital television Cable television High-definition television Lightning rod Federal Standard 1037C Satellite television Home Box Office Communications satellite Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Ethernet Television Coaxial cable Wi-Fi Modem Radar Federal Communications Commission Overhead powerline National Weather Service Oscilloscope Television in the United States STS-61 Radio Media in Canada TV-FM DX TiVo Radio masts and towers Naval mine Wind turbine Transmitter Drill bit WWOR-TV Digital Subscriber Line Wind power Tallest structures in the United States Electric motor Digital audio broadcasting SCART Satellite dish Lightning safety Surveillance Decibel Suspension bridge Set-top box Lightning ANT1 DVD Wardenclyffe Tower Hard disk Broadcasting ABS-CBN Universal Serial Bus Television network Commercial broadcasting Television syndication MIM-23 Hawk DirecTV Television in Canada Telephone tapping Dish Network Telephone Bluetooth Broadcast television system Aircraft carrier Radio controlled airplane WTBS (TV) General Dynamics F-111 Electricity pylon TBS (TV network) NTSC Five (TV) XERF Electric power transmission Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina TGV Integrated Services Digital Network B-47 Stratojet Microphone RS-232 BBC Channel 4 Ford Crown Victoria American Broadcasting Company Internet Royal Navy CVF programme Gramophone record Digital cable Volleyball Circuit design Atari 8-bit family UPN

which has a better picture lcd or plasma here put simply is the differences between plasma and lcd lcd's higher resolution sharper brighter non reflective plasma faster processor for movement smoother images more natural colours because of higher contrasts and dimensional look most people are buying lcds as with hd tv they look that much sharper etc if you are a sports fanatic recommend plasma still because of lots of movement but for general tv and dvds and sports lcd follow the trend both are great technologies just different similar prices across the board too it seems that no matter who you talk too or read reviews about plasma still comes up with the overall best picture but most people would rather have sharper image and non reflective screen than a more realistic image with smoother movement recommend samsung sony lcds samsung panasonic pioneer plasmas hope this helps  Liquid crystal display Plasma display Television Liquid crystal display television Digital photography Computer display Blu-ray Disc Gamut Stereoscopy Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Laptop IMac DualDisc TFT LCD Movie projector Pixel PowerBook Sega Dreamcast Plasma (physics) PlayStation 3 DVD PlayStation Portable Sega Sega Saturn Sharp Zaurus MSX Samsung Photography Hard disk Quark-gluon plasma PlayStation 2 Xbox Tungsten Handheld Windows XP Digital single-lens reflex cameras PLATO Game Boy Advance Cathode ray tube Digital projector Nintendo Revolution Video Panasonic Fusion power Mouse (computing) S__CAM Quake III Arena Xbox 360 Game Boy Creative Zen Digital cinema Sound Blaster MPEG-2 Nintendo GameCube Binoculars Holography Organic light-emitting diode Contrast ratio EMac Gameking Konica Minolta 8 mm video format Zire Handheld Palm OS Microscopy Textile manufacturing Apple Computer Teletext Central processing unit Computer and video games Cassini-Huygens Atari Lynx Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Motion picture rating system Apple II family Screensaver Amstrad CPC Fishfinder Automatic number plate recognition Interlace Windows Vista ThinkPad Nintendo Camcorder Drawing Leica Videotape Nintendo 64 Doom 3 Rendering (computer graphics) 1080p Oscilloscope Particle accelerator DLP Data General

how do i fix the convergence on my tv it is a ge model gw i posted a question earlier in regards to finding a remote control for my tv to see if i could fix the problem i did buy the remote control that was suggested by the ones that answered my question i bought the rca d i went under menu but could not find the option to fix this problem the picture is all over the place i appreciate all of your help thank you very much sorry about the misguidance the picture is notall over the place it is not centered thanks man we might need a chassis number from the back label ctc ptk ptk or or something like that if it's all over the place like you say it sounds more like you have a problem with the output transistors in the convergence circuit unfortunately that's not a consumer based repair as it requires the ability to use an oscilloscope and a digital multimeter to identify shorted transistors open resistors and bad signals driving those transistors ge rca does not use convergence amps if they did it might make it somewhat consumer friendly enough to do it yourself but even then most consumers overheat the copper foils and lift them off the board or solder bridge two pins and blow up the amp also if you find a board located up front with a bunch of pots knobs on them you might want to turn off the tv and disconnect reconnect each plug on the front board about times each i have seen those pins get corroded enough to really screw up the alignment but that's on a ctc chassis only and not all 's have the front board with all the cable plugs either that's why techs are still out there making a living at it  Operational amplifier Electronic amplifier Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Atari 8-bit family BS 1363 Circuit design Embedded system Jack plug IPod Transistor Capacitor plague Universal Serial Bus Nintendo Entertainment System Electronics Resistor Computer Modem Xbox SCART Surface-mount technology Electric motor Printed circuit board Commodore 64 MOSFET Television PCB layout guidelines Xbox 360 Liquid crystal display Kenwood Electronics Sound Blaster Central processing unit Fuse (electrical) Gramophone record IBM 1620 Integrated circuit PlayStation 2 Digital circuit Laserdisc Enigma machine Logic gate Soldering CMOS Digital photography Sinclair ZX81 Cray-1 Remote control Semiconductor device Windows XP Radiation hardening Analog-to-digital converter Modchip Carburetor CPU design D-subminiature Electric guitar Ethernet Transformer Synthesizer Rail terminology Marshall Amplification Bass guitar DMX (lighting) Digital Subscriber Line Copy protection IP Multimedia Subsystem Current source Teletext Fluorescent lamp Linear regulator Volt Musical Instrument Digital Interface Field effect transistor Western concert flute Action potential Computer bus Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Canon T90 Electrophysiology Photography ITU-T Digital video recorder X10 (industry standard) PlayStation 3 Effects unit M4 Sherman Aluminium Dimmer Super Nintendo Entertainment System Potentiometer Walkman Password

why do i have slightly faded black lines going up on my viewsonic hd lcd i noticed this about acouple months that slightly faded lines move up the screen whenever i'm watching tv and playing games i thought it was the component cable and bought of them still the same ok this is my set up i have a component selector box have the main component hooked to the lcd tv and the selector box now switch is where i have the component cable hooked up from the selector box to the cable box switch is hooked up from the selector box to my xbox i still get the lines without the selector box your help is greatly appreciated thank you it sounds like one of your filtering capacitors on your power supply is introducing hum bars into your picture if it's hum you normally see one horizontal bar rise slowly from the bottom upwards it's rare if it moves downwards but it can if it's one of the smps filters you normally see tens of bars moving left to right that's even more rare now let's make sure it's not outside of your tv set the way we do this is to remove all hdmi component and rf cables you should have no signal coming in now the nice thing is if your picture turns blue or gray without a signal if it's still there you know it's the filters if you have a black picture activate your menu and look at it is the bars rolling thru the menu at all then it's the power supply filters if not see if there is a video muting selection in the video or setup icons turn it on and see if the blue appears with lines once again the tv is at fault and you can contact an authorized servicer for your brand and have those caps replaced  Television Oscilloscope PlayStation Portable Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Liquid crystal display SCART NTSC Windows XP Universal Serial Bus Mouse (computing) Electronic amplifier Nintendo DS Game Boy Advance Laserdisc Transformer Cable television Windows 2000 Circuit design Pump It Up Stereoscopy Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 SMPTE color bars Video game console Static inverter plant Railway signal IPod Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Nintendo Entertainment System DVD Electric guitar Operational amplifier Capacitor AmigaOS Loudspeaker Game Boy Phreaking Light-emitting diode Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Textile manufacturing Danger Hiptop Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Nintendo GameCube High-definition television Digital photography IBM PC compatible Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Low-pass filter Sega Saturn Pixel Arcade cabinet GunBound Original Amiga chipset Digital television Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Modem System/34 Thermostat TGV ATI Technologies Bass guitar IMac Pinball Capacitor plague Computer and video games Electronic filter Computer display Watch Manual transmission Photography Xbox 360 Baseball DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX S__CAM International Phonetic Alphabet Karaoke Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Color High-voltage direct current Anchor Polarization Digital Visual Interface Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Mario Yohoho!

is it better to buy a plasma and risk image burn vs lcd and lose color contrast tv guy but i do play games not for hours upon hours but perhaps for up to rarely but possibly hours at a time you would hate watching an image burn all day long you want the best of both worlds sony just developed hz refresh rate in their xbr models it's also in some of the v and s series of tvs too they are all wax chassis sets what does this do it keeps the picture razor sharp with hi speed action so your games don't look blurry when you're moving fast the overall color and contrast on an lcd tv won't be a real problem they are very very close to a plasma in fact i like the anti glare properties of an lcd screen the portability of lcd the sharpness of lcd the color rendition of lcd and a lot more too and plasmas well they're hot and they're heavy the picture is no better than any of the newer lcds i really don't think they look any brighter either  Liquid crystal display television Liquid crystal display Television Cathode ray tube Plasma display Handheld game console Digital photography PlayStation Portable Game Boy PowerBook Stereoscopy Konica Minolta Laptop Sega Dreamcast TFT LCD Computer display Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting IBM PC compatible Nintendo Virtual Boy Pixel Gameking Sharp Zaurus Nintendo Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Tungsten Handheld Sega Saturn Sega Super Nintendo Entertainment System Gamut Movie projector Spider-Man (games) PlayStation 3 Tank Windows XP Oscilloscope Atari 8-bit family Welding DLP MAME Photography PlayStation 2 Quake III Arena Creative Zen Refresh rate Computer and video games ThinkPad Nintendo Entertainment System Game Boy Color Nintendo GameCube Professional video camera Nintendo DS Watch Walkman The Legend of Zelda series Gran Turismo (game) Sega Game Gear Apollo 8 Loudspeaker PlayStation (original) Color Canon T90 Thermostat NTSC 24 Hours of Le Mans Gradius Nuclear fusion Final Fantasy Cinematography Nintendo 64 History of computer and video games Surveillance Screensaver Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Interlace Fast bowling MMORPG Astronomy on Mars Mario Xbox 360 Light gun Bluetooth Hydrogen LCD projector High-definition television TurboGrafx 16 Automatic number plate recognition Starsiege: Tribes Digital camera Internal ballistics Digital projector Persistence of vision Hard disk Cheating in Counter-Strike Fusion power Rendering (computer graphics) ITunes Technicolor

' sylvania super screen tv color problems hi i have a sylvania big super screen tv ' i pulled the back off and i see that the red and the blue guns are on but not the middle green gun i am only getting a very high red with some blue in picture looks like a devil screen do you think that the middle gun is shot or can it be checked first also is this too expensive to replace any help would be appreciated thankyou adrienne sorry to say this but i think it may be time to buy a new tv i seriously doubt that sylvania is still selling parts for this tv and if they do they would probably be pretty expensive and as far as checking it maybe try setting your tv to full green and none of the other colors to see if it still works use a multimeter to check if there is a current running through the wires going to and from the gun other than that call around local tv repair shops  Oscilloscope Light gun Television Game Boy Super Nintendo Entertainment System Super Mario Bros.

i have bell express vu i require to take connection from my bedroom wall socket to decoders can i do it detailed explanation i have one wall socket in my bedroom from which a cable goes to one decoder i require to split the signal from the wall socket to have cables run to decoders can i do this if so what do i need to do please advise thanks no the reason is the wire you have is designed to carry a signal for one receiver not two signals for two receivers if that is the only tv you have in your house you would have to run another cable down from the dish to get another line if you need more then tv you can get a multiplexer and put it near the dish to convert signals into the only way the multiplexer works is coverting to as it needs both inputs so putting it in your bedroom would not work  SCART Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Modem Cable television Satellite television Digital Subscriber Line Digital television Central processing unit Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Satellite dish Loudspeaker Category 5 cable RS-232 Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Time-division multiplexing Ethernet BS 1363 FM broadcasting Jack plug Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Multiplexer T-carrier Dimmer Pirate decryption Low-noise block converter Telephone Telegraphy S__CAM Universal Serial Bus Advanced Technology Attachment Musical Instrument Digital Interface Set-top box National Electrical Code (US) Electrical wiring (UK) Antenna (radio) Communications satellite Digital video recorder Public Broadcasting Service RCA connector High-definition television Integrated Services Digital Network Three-phase electric power Submarine communications cable Freeview Telephone exchange Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Analog-to-digital converter Optical fiber Television Electrical wiring Transformer Fuse (electrical) Digital circuit Radio Coaxial cable New I/O Electronics Solar power Telephone tapping Wavelength-division multiplexing Impedance matching Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line D-subminiature DMX (lighting) TGV Power line communication Bluetooth Xbox Dual-tone multi-frequency CPU cache Oscilloscope Television encryption Teletext Phantom power Digital terrestrial television Apollo Guidance Computer Home Box Office X10 (industry standard) Athlon 64 Public Switched Telephone Network IS-95 IEEE 802.11 Ring circuit Telecommunication Overhead lines Barcode reader Broadcast television system Morse Code UTF-8 Code division multiple access Electronic amplifier Broadcasting Ground (electricity) Digital DIN connector S-Video Operational amplifier Opteron

which should i get flat screen tv or a projector my boyfriend wants to get a projector but the majority use for the tv will be to watch tv daily won't it get expensive having to replace the bulbs is it better to get a flat screen for daily tv watching instead of a projector the lamp replacement is the most expensive defference here as far as flat screen ithink you mean flat panel thats the thin ones that you can hang on the wall flat screens are just the regular tube tvs with a flat screen any way it also depends on what screen size you are looking for the projector im assuming you mean front projectors the ones where you have the small device and it projects the image onto a wall or screen other than the rear projector lcds or dlps any way the projector can give you very big screen sizes pepending on how far away you place the projector but for picture detail and brightness the plat panel either lcd flat panel or plasma will give you better brightness and picture quality over the projectors if you mean rear projection types like lcd rear projection or dlp the picture quality can be very good but it wont be wall mountable as they tend to be inches deep they will be cheaper at first but you do have the issue of lamp repalcement over time so really unless you plan on having very large screen size front projector or low initial cost rear projector i would ultimately choose a flat panel either lcd or plasma hoped i helped good luck  Television Liquid crystal display Plasma display DLP Movie projector LCD projector Light-emitting diode Digital projector Lighting Digital photography Cathode ray tube Projection screen TFT LCD IMac Fluorescent lamp Widescreen Headlight Oscilloscope IMAX Laptop Stereoscopy Liquid crystal display television Digital cinema Solar power Bicycle lighting Movie theater Incandescent light bulb Anamorphic widescreen Screensaver Slide projector Video Drill bit Gamut Pixel View camera Stage lighting Photography Enlarger Vacuum tube Cinerama Contrast ratio Plasma (physics) Mechanical television Compact fluorescent lamp 35 mm film Organic light-emitting diode Wardenclyffe Tower High-definition television Eyepiece Computer display Persistence of vision Perspective projection distortion Automotive lighting Terminal ballistics Welding Photographic lens Light gun Imperial (automobile) Bicycle frame Mercury-vapor lamp Computer 3-D film Atari 8-bit family Out-of-body experience Digital Visual Interface Konica Minolta IPod nano Equine conformation Transparency (photography) Strap-on dildo Bicycle Film Nintendo Mattress Rail tracks Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Temporal bone Gas metal arc welding Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis PowerBook M16 (rifle) Laserdisc Binoculars Computer animation Magnet Bluetooth Microphone Handheld game console Glass Photolithography Map Fire alarm control panel Digital cinematography ThinkPad 19th century in film Inertial confinement fusion PLATO

what's the difference between lcd and plasma tvs here put simply is the differences between plasma and lcd lcd's higher resolution sharper brighter non reflective plasma faster processor for movement smoother images more natural colours because of higher contrasts and dimensional look most people are buying lcds as with hd tv they look that much sharper etc if you are a sports fanatic recommend plasma still because of lots of movement but for general tv and dvds and sports lcd follow the trend both are great technologies just different similar prices across the board too it seems that no matter who you talk too or read reviews about plasma still comes up with the overall best picture but most people would rather have sharper image and non reflective screen than a more realistic image with smoother movement recommend samsung sony lcds samsung panasonic pioneer plasmas hope this helps  Liquid crystal display Television Plasma display Liquid crystal display television Digital photography Computer display Blu-ray Disc High-definition television Gamut Stereoscopy Laserdisc Laptop Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis IMac TFT LCD DualDisc PlayStation Portable Xbox PowerBook Pixel Sega Dreamcast Xbox 360 Plasma (physics) Handheld game console PlayStation 3 DVD S__CAM Sega Sega Saturn Sharp Zaurus MSX Samsung Quark-gluon plasma Teletext Hard disk PlayStation 2 Tungsten Handheld Photography Digital single-lens reflex cameras Windows XP Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Nintendo Revolution Game Boy Advance Digital projector PLATO Fusion power Panasonic Cathode ray tube Video Quake III Arena Game Boy Creative Zen DLP Sound Blaster Mouse (computing) Digital cinema Nintendo GameCube Binoculars Holography Organic light-emitting diode Contrast ratio EMac Konica Minolta Gameking Microscopy Zire Handheld 8 mm video format Palm OS Textile manufacturing Central processing unit Computer animation Apple Computer Digital camera Light-emitting diode Computer and video games Atari Lynx Cassini-Huygens Super Nintendo Entertainment System Screensaver Amstrad CPC Fishfinder ThinkPad Automatic number plate recognition Apple II family Nintendo Camcorder Interlace Leica Windows Vista Oscilloscope Doom 3 Motion picture rating system Rendering (computer graphics) 1080p Nintendo 64 Particle accelerator Videotape Drawing

can you fix a burnt out plasma help i think i may have killed my friend's tv aparently when i turned off the system i turned off the surround sound cable box but not the tv thought i did but aparently it was on for like hrs w out a signal now he says it had no picture is there a way to fix it it is repairable unless it was hit by a lightning strike or strong power surge but your friend should make sure you did not just select an input that is inactive instead of turning it off also agree with answer below mine it might need to be unplugged for a minute or two and then plugged back in to reset some kind of automatic protection that was triggered by leaving it on and hdtv sets with digital tuners can experience tuner lockup and also need to be unplugged to fix by the way did your friend turn the cable box back on sorry i have to ask because some people really do not know how to operate their own audio video equipment once the installer leaves  High-definition television Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting SCART Television TiVo Digital television Cable television Xbox IPod Oscilloscope ITU-T Modem DVD High fidelity TV tuner card Universal Serial Bus Set-top box Telephone exchange Digital video recorder Welding Loudspeaker Digital cable Radio Dolby Laboratories Federal Standard 1037C PlayStation Portable Audiophile Impedance matching Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Diablo II: Lord of Destruction ATSC Freeview Fuse (electrical) Spark gap Lightning Atari 8-bit family Embedded system GSM services Frequency modulation Domestic AC power plugs and sockets ITunes Pirate decryption Phreaking Naval mine Composite video Bluetooth Power line communication Digital Visual Interface Nirvana (band) Videocassette recorder Synthesizer Satellite television Nintendo GameCube Apollo Guidance Computer Windows Vista Johnny 5 Kenwood Electronics Automatic transmission Windows XP Compact audio cassette Compact disc Lightning rod Protoss Windows 2000 FM broadcasting Solar power Jack plug Widescreen NTSC Photography Camcorder Wi-Fi TurboGrafx 16 D-subminiature Ground (electricity) Copy protection Telephone RCA connector X10 (industry standard) Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Musical Instrument Digital Interface Arc welding Digital audio broadcasting S-Video Electronic amplifier Electric guitar Dimmer MPEG-2 Secure Digital card XLR connector DVB Telegraphy Video Digital Subscriber Line Circuit design Mixing console

what really happened to my flat screen tv that after a loud thunder it wont turn back on i know it should be taken to a repair shop but i wud like to know what's messed up a fuse power supply etc in simple english thank you for those that answereed my prior q's regarding same matter thunder isn't the problem it's the lightning very high current surge that creates emp electro magnetic pulse a principle of electric current is the magnetic field it creates and rapidly changing magnetic fields induce currents in other electrical devices that can produce very large voltage spikes large voltage spikes can easly ruin transistor circuits this is why the old soviet union used tubes instead of transistors in many of their warfare devices airplanes tanks they are less likely to get damaged by a nuclear bomb another source of very high emp direct hits by lightning are extremely damaging but induced voltages by nearby hits are also bad news for electronics recommendations to get a new tv are probably your only reasonable solution lightning arrestors bleed off high voltage on antenna connections and may help in the future and ups un interruptable power supplies clean up voltage spikes both should be used you can't always be around when lightning occurs but you can try to isolate the tv from the impact of a nearby lightning strike as for a direct hit consider a lightning arrestor rod on your roof it bleeds off current to a nearby cloud with high potential and does it before the lightning actually jumps between ground and the cloud check out the links for more information  Transformer Circuit design Radiation hardening Diode Spark gap Electric motor Capacitor Vacuum tube Oscilloscope Transistor Tesla coil Lightning Directed-energy weapon Nuclear explosion Digital circuit High-voltage direct current High-voltage hazards Electricity Volt Naval mine Battery (electricity) Fluorescent lamp Circuit breaker MOSFET Fusion power Overhead powerline Electrophysiology Welding Magnet Operational amplifier Impedance matching Resistor Galileo spacecraft Overvoltage Voltage source Cathode ray tube Computer Decibel Electronic amplifier Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Transmitter Solar power Linear particle accelerator Fuse (electrical) Lightning safety Radio Cavity magnetron Magnetic core memory Central processing unit Current source Electronics Switched-mode power supply Liquid crystal display Electric shock Light-emitting diode Spacecraft propulsion Ground (electricity) Alternating current Relay CMOS Field effect transistor Loudspeaker Voltage regulator Action potential Current (electricity) Fusor Solar cell Electric power transmission Terran (StarCraft) Electronic power supply Radar RS-232 Microphone Particle accelerator Energy development Semiconductor device Wind turbine Hall effect Voltmeter Gas metal arc welding Static inverter plant 2003 North America blackout Bipolar junction transistor Cyclotron Geomagnetic storm Earthing system Nuclear weapon design Seismic retrofit Electrical network Combine (Half-Life 2) Renewable energy Plasma (physics) Electricity meter Ohm's law

can i subscribe to digital cable from the states i am in the military but have always been fortunate enough to get stationed places where there is broadband however i've not been so lucky in finding places where i can find high quality english language programming now that digital cable is out is there a service where i can just connect my cablebox to the internet and get stateside programming anywhere in the world it's not likely that you'll be able to subscribe to a stateside cable service over the internet even though their service is digital it is not an internet service however almost all of the networks these days are making their popular shows available for viewing over the internet so if there's a show you like you can just go to the website and you'll likely be able to view the latest episode online by the way the previous answer regarding a slingbox may work but it will be horrendously slow the slinbox is intended to be used within a home network where the speed between nodes is mbps or so the speed at which you'll be able to access that box over the owner's broadband connection will be more like mbps or less so it would take hours to download your shows stick with the network websites  Cable television Broadband Internet access Digital Subscriber Line Voice over IP Internet service provider Internet Digital television Broadband Now Broadband TV NTL Power line communication BBC Telewest Broadband TiVo Communications satellite Telephone Ethernet MTV2 Modem Canadian Broadcasting Corporation America Online GSM services Dial-up access StarHub Xbox Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting IP Multimedia Subsystem Public Switched Telephone Network Integrated Services Digital Network Television in the United States Satellite television Media in Ireland Skype MSN TV BBC Television Austar Vertical service code Cable modem British Sky Broadcasting Gnutella Global System for Mobile Communications Computer and video games Broadband Networks Dish Network Telstra Sky Digital Home Box Office Television in Canada Media in Canada Wireless LAN Ulster Television File sharing Nintendo DS Computer Five (TV) Asynchronous Transfer Mode ITV Pirate decryption Online service provider Podcasting Bluetooth Microsoft Freenet Television syndication Satellite internet DOCSIS Television network Eircom Dorama Commercial broadcasting Public Broadcasting Service PlayStation 2 Universal Mobile Telecommunications System TransACT IPod AT&T Telegraphy Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act National Weather Service Channel 4 Telkom MDAC Digital divide Virtual private network Web crawler Foxtel NEC Corporation FidoNet Xbox 360

what is wrong with my tv member since april total points level points earned this week best answer glddstgpsy s why is the sound so soft on my tv why is the sound so soft on my tv i have a philips hdtv i bought last year its flat screen and has wonderful picture and color my problem is that when i watch a movie on either my sony dvd player or my playstation the sound is so soft i have to increase my tv's volume to around out of when i watch tv on a directv dvr receiver the volume is plenty loud at i have the playstation connected by an hdmi cable and i have the dvd player connected by the three color cords white red yellow when i want to watch something on either player i change the input to either hdmi or av what could be the cause of this difference in volume i think its ridiculous to have to increase the tv volume in order to watch a movie and actually hear what's going on does anyone have any ideas what is going wrong yes i have to turn the volume way up when i watch a dvd but with the tv it is at a reasonable level not sure about the ps but for dvd players i can answer this dts and dolby digital are the audio formats used on dvd and they have a very high dynamic range dynamic range is a measure of the difference between the loudest and softest sounds that a source can produce without losing any sound quality you may have noticed that while watching movies the volume goes up during action fight chase scenes this is the dynamic range in action they intentionally make the usual dialogue etc quieter than the action scenes so that the action is emphasized on my panasonic surround sound htib i normally set the volume to db range is from to db as that is the highest it goes before the subwoofer level is turned down and it is also the volume where the dialogue is at a comfortable level and the action blares having said that i will mention that on most players it is possible to disable and sometimes adjust the amount of dynamic range allowed by adjusting a setting in the setup menu called appropriately enough dynamic range compression turning this on will make all parts of the movie be at the same sound level to me this makes the movie sound bland but it is quite useful when other people are sleeping as it stops you from having to manually adjust the volume during the action scenes so that it doesn't wake them up also i am not sure why you are using the composite video yellow input for the dvd as it is really killing your picture quality i would be using progressive scan through the component video input if the tv and dvd player both have the ports and support it if they don't have component ports i would at least use the s video connection  High-definition television PlayStation Portable Loudspeaker PlayStation 3 Nintendo GameCube Movie projector Dolby Digital Xbox Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Dolby Laboratories Audio level compression PlayStation 2 Warez Xbox 360 DualDisc Widescreen MPEG-2 IPod Sound Blaster Oscilloscope Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Gramophone record Super Nintendo Entertainment System Audiophile ZX Spectrum NTSC Digital Theatre System Digital video recorder H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Resident Evil (video game) Sony Vorbis Video codec Film Compact audio cassette Videotape Subwoofer Digital photography Original Amiga chipset Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Cyberspace TiVo Microsoft Video Camcorder Violin High-Definition Multimedia Interface Amstrad CPC Digital rights management Super Audio CD Computer and video games Mouse (computing) 24 (television) Windows Vista Timpani Copy protection Bubble Bobble Anamorphic widescreen High fidelity Audio data compression Audio commentary (DVD) S-VHS Headphones Nintendo Revolution Cheating in Counter-Strike Digital cinema Atari 8-bit family Enterprise content management Stereoscopy Super Video CD Game Boy Video CD DVD-Audio Mattress Sega Dreamcast Electronic organ Gradius Cable television Microeconomics Circuit design Digital television Volleyball Carburetor System/34 Videocassette recorder Metal Gear Solid

how do you hook up a direct tv satellite dish we have an extra dish that we want to hook up at our camp and want to try to do it ourselves i did it myself and it wasn't as complicated as i expected the dish comes with a cable to connect it to the satellite receiver which in turn connects to the tv there is an installation kit that comes with several different kinds of hardware to hang it on a brick wall anchor it to concrete put it on the roof etc there is also a little compass in the kit and you look up the azimuth compass heading and the elevation angle above the horizon in the instructions based on your zip code you set the dish to this position then the receiver has a mode where it measures the strength of the signal and you move the dish a little big up and down and from side to side looking to get the strongest signal there is even an audible signal on the tv so you can just listen through an open window while you're up on the ladder adjusting the dish i got it right on in about five minutes i expected it to be a lot harder because the satellite is so tiny and so far away but it turned out to be very easy then you call directv and they do some stuff at their end to turn the signal on  Satellite dish Communications satellite Polarization Satellite television Anchor Oscilloscope Modem Sundial Antenna (radio) Glossary of firefighting equipment Global Positioning System Skateboarding trick Solar power Navigation Radar Pirate decryption Poker jargon VHF omnidirectional range DirecTV TiVo Wind turbine Equine conformation IPod Direct broadcast satellite Booting Teletext Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Glossary of American football Elevator Xbox Optical fiber Glossary of nautical terms Stairway Arecibo Observatory Set-top box Ethernet Space elevator Glossary of climbing terms Digital circuit Game Boy Advance High-definition television Huygens probe Cable television Sextant Drill bit Addressing mode Sailing Digital video recorder Rail terminology RS-232 Mouse (computing) Swingout Digital television Bluetooth Aerial (dance move) Radio controlled airplane Cheating in Counter-Strike Chess terminology Home Box Office Professional wrestling match types Charles Wheatstone Enigma machine Universal Serial Bus Atari 8-bit family Loudspeaker TV-FM DX Professional wrestling holds Control character Copy protection Resident Evil (video game) MP3 Rigging Kernel (computer science) Atari ST Electrophysiology Satellite radio Quake III Arena Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Suplex Cruising (maritime) GunZ The Duel Strap-on dildo Carburetor Morse Code Avalanche Digital audio broadcasting Voice over IP Passenger car Broadband Internet access Public Broadcasting Service PIC microcontroller Celestial navigation STS-61 Floppy disk Seismometer

i have a inch rca tv it gives a sound but no clear picture it has lines that runs thru it what can i do if it is an analog tv not digital or hdtv then you need a better antenna better antenna connection or better cable connection or you need to be more specific about what lines you are referring to going thru the picture have a friend who knows something about tvs look at it or seek help from a service professional too many people use the push on cable wires that come with vcrs and those cause picture problems especially on tv cable due to the lack of a good connection and poor shielding always use ohm f connector cables that screw on finger tight  Television Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting SCART Laserdisc Digital television Xbox DVD Coaxial cable S-Video RCA connector S__CAM Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Impedance Decibel Digital Visual Interface S-VHS Advanced Technology Attachment Ethernet IPod Ribbon cable Federal Communications Commission Satellite television Atari 8-bit family Digital cable Universal Serial Bus D-subminiature Xbox 360 DMX (lighting) Nintendo Entertainment System XLR connector Bluetooth Gramophone record Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Set-top box Antenna (radio) Digital video recorder S/PDIF Musical Instrument Digital Interface TiVo Communications satellite Telegraphy Jack plug Videotape Serial ATA Synthesizer Transformer Balanced audio Impedance matching PAL Overhead powerline SCSI Composite video NTSC Apollo Command/Service Module Federal Standard 1037C Digital photography TIA-568A/B ATSC Electrical wiring FireWire Integrated Services Digital Network Modem Category 5 cable Audiophile Digital Subscriber Line Loudspeaker Nintendo GameCube Drill bit Camcorder Phantom power Commodore 64 DIN connector Videocassette recorder BS 1363 Ohm's law VHS Home cinema RS-232 Telephone Telephone tapping Electrophysiology Wi-Fi Nominal impedance 8 mm video format Atari ST Teletext Internet Sound card Betacam ITU-T ITV Hearing aid 10BASE5 Copy protection Broadband Internet access Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Power line communication Glossary of climbing terms

getting a '' lcd that barely fits in my tv cabinet audio question i live in a small apartment where the walls in the living room are sort of rectangular and there is only one place i have space for my tv cabinet and i cannot put the plasma anyhwere else because i have some pretty expensive art hanging off the other walls the problem is the tv dimensions are mm and the tv cabinet can accommodate up to cm on each side of it will that affect the sound of the tv yeah i meant lcd the tv cabinet currently holds a inch tv there would only be cm space on the sides if i get the '' but plenty of room behind and above it just place the tv near the front opening and there won't be any noticeable difference having it toward the rear of the cabinet might cause a few unwanted reflections but that too would be minimal as long as it fits you'll be fine lcds run pretty cool so one centimeter clearance should be okay if you're worried about air circulation just cut a couple of holes in the back of the cabinet one high one low that will provide plenty of air for the tv  Equine conformation Vacuum Kitchen Liquid crystal display Floppy disk Stereoscopy Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Transformer Solar power McMansion Gramophone record Television Wood carving Door Plasma display Solar cell Lighting Car handling Sento Drill bit Internal ballistics Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Laptop Table saw Surface-mount technology Dundas Square Thermal power station Glossary of partner dance terms Paintball marker Stairway Fire fighting M16 (rifle) Movie projector Jet engine Mattress Bong View camera Panama Canal Directed-energy weapon Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Antenna (radio) Wood Compact disc The Time Machine Spacecraft propulsion Discovery One Bicycle lighting Subwoofer Vowel Katana Boeing 737 Laser Hard disk Poker jargon Cloud Bass guitar P-38 Lightning IMac Nine Inch Nails Welding Oscilloscope Bicycle frame American handball Formula One cars Microeconomics Opportunity rover 10 Downing Street Handloading Diamond simulant Tire Acoustics Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Global climate model Changeroom Babylon 5 Dam Strap-on dildo Light-emitting diode Badminton Printed circuit board John Cage Timpani Racquetball Air-raid shelter Mitsubishi 3000GT Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Digital photography Engine cooling Mouse (computing) Sega Saturn Carburetor Kidney Organic light-emitting diode Air conditioning CPU design Vacuum tube Gameking Abbey

is plasma the best should i buy a plasma tv everything i see and hear tells me that plasma is by far the best flat out theonly thing is that when it starts to die it dies how long do plasmas last i need ten years or at least before i totally believe in plasma but the picture quality is by far the best and i have been researching quite a bit lately pretty much all test labs and reviewers agree that plasma has the best picture of the flatscreen display technologies best in this case meaning most accurate color contrast ratio and black level microdisplay crt tube and direct projection technologies can also create great pictures often better than plasma but are not flatscreens lcd the other main flatscreen technology has advantages in bright rooms and non critical viewing but cannot meet the visual specifications of plasma plasma longevity is much less of an issue with current technology than it has been in the past plasma manufacturers now advertise hour half lives time until the picture reaches half its original maximum brightness as the useful life of their sets this equates to years of life if your tv is on hours a day if you run your set at less than maximum brightness and contrast which you should you can expect the higher end of these numbers since this is a gradual effect you can often compensate for dimming plasma by re calibrating your settings lcd technology is actually more of a sudden death scenario than plasma in that when the backlight burns out suddenly it must be replaced however lcd backlights can be replaced as long as they remain available while plasma panels can't be effectively recharged or repaired once they lose brightness having said that plasma is still a bit of a touchy technology in terms of power heat output and fragility it's one of the few types of a v component i would buy an extended warranty for  Television Liquid crystal display television Light-emitting diode Cathode ray tube Oscilloscope Organic light-emitting diode TFT LCD Digital photography Loudspeaker Gamut Central processing unit Solar cell Bicycle lighting PowerBook Screensaver Stereoscopy High-definition television Fuel injection Lighting Solar variation Solar power Sun PlayStation Portable Welding Pixel Big Bang Incandescent light bulb Laserdisc Tesla coil Plasma (physics) Laser Photography Movie projector Nintendo DS Contrast ratio Directed-energy weapon Transistor Particle accelerator Fluorescent lamp IBM PC compatible Lightning Binoculars Gross domestic product Turbocharger Polarization Battery (electricity) Internal ballistics TGV Cold fusion Tank Decibel Dimmer Items in the Metroid series Color Transformer Quark-gluon plasma IPod Galileo spacecraft Apple typography Explosive material Ionosphere Toyota Prius Magnet DLP Nuclear fusion Video Digital audio broadcasting Aurora (astronomy) DVD Phase-shift keying Audiophile Computer Hypoglycemia Computer display Life extension Handheld game console Radar Hydrogen Non-standard cosmology Microeconomics Langmuir probe National Weather Service Plasma stability MP3 Global warming Carbon dioxide Terminal ballistics

coaxial rf cable and hdtv ok im a little confused i have read that coaxial rf cable cannot send hd signals this is off the discovery website so then why does my tv say i on some of the hd stations and why am i receiving hd stations coaxial cable is a popular and cost effective method used to carry digital audio as well as analog and digital rf video signals up to several hundred feet or beyond with minimum degradation or loss depending on the signal cable construction and quality and the electronics within the signal path as i interpreted discovery s hd guru tutorial they are strictly referring to a traditional standard definition analog composite baseband video signal which is normally transmitted over coaxial cable connected to a typical coaxial rf input and should not be construed otherwise however their assertion would no longer apply when it comes to a digital video signal input directly from a cable tv provider to a coaxial rf input on a high definition plug and play digital television cable tv providers and direct broadcast aka direct to home satellite tv providers regularly utilize coaxial cabling most often high grade rg to carry digital high definition tv signals p and i along with their digital standard definition tv signals whether from the catv provider s individual hubs and nodes to the subscriber's premises or from an lnb affixed to an exterior satellite antenna mounted outside a subscriber's premises to the satellite receiver located inside you will find the ubiquitous coaxial cable the professional video and broadcast industry has used high performance high quality coaxial cable for distributing digital high definition video and television signals up to p for more than a decade new technology along with a set of new standards currently makes it possible to transmit p digital high definition video signals over a single g sdi coaxial cable  High-definition television Television Digital television Satellite television Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Coaxial cable Ethernet Digital Subscriber Line Modem SCART Federal Standard 1037C DVD Communications satellite Loudspeaker Digital Public Broadcasting Service GSM services Satellite dish Terrestrial television Broadband Internet access Broadcasting Radio Set-top box Composite video Telephone exchange Xbox Teletext Digital audio broadcasting Wi-Fi Voice over IP FM broadcasting Transistor Digital Visual Interface Digital cable NTSC Pirate decryption Serial Digital Interface Bluetooth Computer Video Oscilloscope Telephone S__CAM Central processing unit Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Direct broadcast satellite Transmission line Synthesizer Electronics Sound recording Digital video recorder Home Box Office Power line communication DVB TiVo Camcorder Musical Instrument Digital Interface Betacam MP3 Software-defined radio Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Electric motor Hearing aid Internet Digital circuit Universal Serial Bus Television channel Digital photography Television in the United States PAL Optical fiber StarChoice Diplexer Antenna (radio) VHS Radar Digital video Television in Canada Cellular network HD Radio Code division multiple access Analog-to-digital converter Freeview Global Positioning System S-Video Phase-locked loop Television encryption IP Multimedia Subsystem Video codec Amateur radio Dolby Laboratories Digital rights management Dish Network Satellite radio

problems with my tv while playing ps i just bought a insignia lcd hdtv from best buy i understand this is one of those you get what you pay for tv's but still i dont think that legitimizes my problem i bought an hdmi cable for the picture quality is absolutely amazing the only problem i have is the sound the only game i've played on it and the only one i own is elder scrolls oblivion as i said the picture comes in great but the sound is almost like the speakers are blown it sounds like an explosion everytime someone hits me in the game then i tried it with the standard component cables and the sound was fine can someone help me with this any sort of help will be appreciated thanks ahead of time the only thing i can think of causing this is the sound settings you have for the ps if you choose a wrong setting then the signal might be too strong for the speakers when you set up the component sound look at what is available and write them down only choose those for the hdmi i strongly recommend getting the hdmi to work so that you can upscale old ps and ps games and standard dvd  Television DVD Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting IBM PC compatible High-Definition Multimedia Interface Home cinema Laserdisc Oscilloscope Digital television Loudspeaker Dolby Laboratories Digital Visual Interface Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Nintendo Entertainment System Cable television NTSC Widescreen 1080p Theory of conduct Audiophile Warez Sound Blaster Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis PlayStation 3 Tris Speaker Sega Dreamcast Video High fidelity Sound recording Xbox Atari ST Shit Mouse (computing) Musical Instrument Digital Interface Atari 8-bit family Xbox 360 Poker jargon Movie projector The Elder Scrolls Digital cable Home Box Office Infantilism PlayStation Portable The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Digital rights management Game Boy Magnet Game theory Hiberno-English ATSC DMX (lighting) British Sky Broadcasting MP3 Hebrew language Liquid crystal display ROM image Dance Dance Revolution Synthesizer Anamorphic widescreen Speech recognition Gramophone record Violin Babe Ruth Decibel Singlish Hey Jude Super Nintendo Entertainment System Digital audio broadcasting Liquid crystal display television DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Computer role-playing game DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Handheld game console African American Vernacular English Ethernet Universal Serial Bus Color Blu-ray Disc Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) The Amazing Race William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin Optical fiber Computer and video games Digital photography Wheel of Fortune Sega Saturn DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Therion (band) Hangul Gross domestic product Bass guitar Spider-Man (games) VHS MPEG-2 Extreme Programming PowerBook

really bad and annoying tv problems recently i just got my dads old tv it worked fine then he got a glistening new hdtv and i got his old inch general electric standard i tv i have a problem with the picture any time i play a game or watch a movie through the av cables any bright colors containing red drag over to the right say i'm playing the elder scrolls iv oblivion on my ps what happens is when its maybe sundown and the sky is red all the red on the screen stays in the same place but also alot of red is being dragged to the right of the screen it gets really annoying any suggestions also every so often what happens is there'll be a little purpleish blue color in the middle right or left of the screen and it gets dreadfully annoying when the tv was in my dads room it never did this all we did was carry it around a corner and up the stairs it never went near any magnets and there arent any magnetic items in my room theres a dvr box to the right of it but nothing else i know of could hurt i had another tv both are roundscreen that had the same exact problems it was also sitting in the same spot as the old tv what sort of thing could cause the tv to do that the tv's are on the second floor its a year old farm house and the only thing in the attic above it are one of the turbine things the metal spinny thingys but i doubt that would have any effect on top of the tv are just a bunch of disks but anyways the tv never did this to my dad only as soon as it got into my room it started messing up whats going on every roundscreen tv i've had in the past has done this to me and only in this room any help or a reason why its doing this would be great btw to the person who said i is needed its not its only if you have an hdmi cable av is for i and p etc but anyways the same problem occurs when im playing on any game console be it my snes n nes gamecube wii ps genesis sega dreamcast or my ps and ps even it also does the same thing with my dvd player vcr and my old dvr box that connects through av inputs rather than a cable line the red bleeding out of it's intended visual area is a sign that the picture tube has aged and is dying it's sometimes possible to rejuvenate the crt and get a few more months out of it but the crt is basically gone at this point if you have a boat and need a new anchor it may be useful in that capacity back down the color and contrast levels to limit this phenomena  Television Computer role-playing game Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sega Dreamcast Super Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo Entertainment System Oscilloscope Nintendo GameCube Sega DVD Nintendo Mouse (computing) SCART High-definition television Xbox Bubble Bobble PlayStation Portable Atari 8-bit family Video game console Laserdisc Cathode ray tube Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Digital video recorder PlayStation 3 TiVo Super Mario Bros. 3 Cable television Sega Saturn Lighting Final Fantasy Computer and video games PlayStation 2 Nintendo 64 Mario Pac-Man Wind turbine Super Mario Bros.

panasonic or samsung plasma i need help choosing between two plasmas and i need to choose fast its between a samsung plasma contrast ratio watt speakers and the rest of the specs include the basic inputs and outputs that you would expect from any plasma the other one is a panasonic plasma contast ratio watt speakers and again it also has the usual input outputs as one would expect ok now here is something the panasonic includes that the samsung does not yet i dont know if this is a feature that should make me want to forget about the samsung its a p digital remastering processor is that good which one would you pick the are both available at sams club incase you want to compare for yourself online thanks i forgot to mention they both are p resoloution but whats the panasonic saying about the p digital remastering processor that it includes thats where i got confused i have been struggling with this same question the samsungs you are looking at ' and ' series currently have the best picture ratings ever per cnet's reviews for plasma sets allow more picture adjustments and tweaking and are typically a bit less expensive the panasonics ' u and ' u series are not far behind in picture quality and are said to run a bit cooler implying energy savings and potential better longevity historically panasonic is a more reliable brand name but samsung has made great recent strides in this area given the nature of plasma technology it's one of the few things i would buy an extended warranty for the difference between the k and k contrast ratio specs is essentially meaningless in the real world i don't personally think the ability to accept p signals is a big deal any source that can produce p such as a ps or an hd dvd player can also output p which is the native resolution of both of these sets note that this is not the same as being able to display at p what you are getting is the opportunity to let the tv rather than the source device do the downconversion which may or may not give a better quality result i am currently leaning towards the panasonic mostly for the anti reflective screen on the u model there are a couple of minor picture issues with the samsung also probably nothing you would notice but they are documented at the avs forum in the link below but honestly i don't think you can go wrong either way good luck  Loudspeaker High-definition television Sound Blaster MP3 Television Digital photography Oscilloscope Analog-to-digital converter Plasma (physics) Central processing unit Blu-ray Disc DVD Laserdisc Home cinema Vorbis MPEG-2 Digital circuit Decibel Windows Vista MSX DualDisc Leica Transformer NTSC Microeconomics Liquid crystal display television Audiophile CPU cache Xbox IPod Plasma display Gramophone record Nintendo Revolution Windows XP Embedded system Liquid crystal display Apple Macintosh PlayStation Portable Laptop Light-emitting diode Holography Law of value Fusion power Inflation Panasonic Laser DV Nuclear fusion Samsung Stereoscopy Atari 8-bit family Game Boy Radeon Anamorphic widescreen Binoculars Computer Tungsten Handheld Digital cinema ATI Technologies Computer display H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Bicycle lighting Gross domestic product Movie projector Electric motor Palm OS Video codec CPU design PostScript Software engineering Cold fusion Fuel injection S__CAM 1080p Musical Instrument Digital Interface Hard disk X Window System Atari ST Super Nintendo Entertainment System Welding Electrophysiology Cheating in Counter-Strike Programmable logic controller ZX Spectrum Camcorder Pentium 4 Hardware random number generator Sinclair ZX81 Floppy disk Incandescent light bulb Modem SCART IBM PC compatible OpenDocument

i have a sanyo tv yrs old standby light comes on but nothing happens when the red light appears and i press any buttons the tv makes a clicking noise as though it is switched on then after a few seconds it returns back to standby any idea cost of getting repaired this is a protection a lot of manufacturers have built in to their tvs to stop you doing major damage to tv when something has gone wrong internally that could pose a risk of overload or fire or even electric shock i would call out an engineer to diagnose the fault and tell you how much it would cost to fix before you decide either to have it repaired or get a new one  Residual-current device Windows XP Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Toyota Prius Elevator Oscilloscope Chernobyl accident Welding Relay Fuse (electrical) Uninterruptible power supply Apollo Guidance Computer Tank Firefighter Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Digital photography Capacitor plague Switch Diode Safety engineering Floppy disk Prank flash Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Reliability engineering Earthing system Space Shuttle program Light switch IPod 2000 Australian Grand Prix GunZ The Duel SCART Battery (electricity) Electrical generator Transistor Electrical wiring Airbus A380 Badminton Electroshock gun Battlefield 2 Golden Sun Seismic retrofit Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Digital circuit Mercury Atlas 6 USS Abbot (DD-629) Bob and George Embedded system 2003 North America blackout Screw Nuclear power Ultraviolet 2005 Hungarian Grand Prix Combine (Half-Life 2) Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Pinball Spark plug USS Tunny (SS-282) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Just In Time Tire Broadband Internet access B-47 Stratojet Transformer T-34 USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Television BS 1363 2005 European Grand Prix USS Hoel (DD-533) Team Fortress Classic Intravenous therapy Fire alarm control panel Weight training GunBound Auto rickshaw Telephone exchange Haloalkane Gas metal arc welding Space disaster Cathode ray tube RuneScape weapons USS S-37 (SS-142) Internal ballistics Hurricane Rita Sanyo Plutonium Manual transmission STS-114 High-voltage direct current Outpost 2 Natural Selection (computer game) Naval mine The Covenant Nintendo Entertainment System MapleStory Stryker Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Venom (comics) International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea

what's better a lcd or plasma tv whats the difference outward appearances are definitely deceiving when it comes to lcd and plasma televisions although both types of televisions are flat and thin they employ different technology in an attempt to deliver similar results plasma tv overview plasma television technology is based loosely on the fluorescent light bulb the display itself consists of cells within each cell two glass panels are separated by a narrow gap in which neon xenon gas is injected and sealed in plasma form during the manufacturing process the gas is electrically charged at specific intervals when the plasma set is in use the charged gas then strikes red green and blue phosphors thus creating a television image each group of red green and blue phosphors is called a pixel picture element although plasma television technology eliminate the need for the bulky picture tube and electron beam scanning of traditional televisions because it still employs the burning of phosphors to generate an image plasma televisions still suffer from some of the drawbacks of traditional televisions such as heat generation and screen burn of static images lcd tv overview lcd televisions on the other hand use a different technology see also question for this same explanation basically lcd panels are made of two layers of transparent material which are polarized and are glued together one of the layers is coated with a special polymer that holds the individual liquid crystals current is then passed through individual crystals which allow the crystals to pass or block light to create images lcd crystals do not produce their own light so an external light source such as florescent bulb is needed for the image created by the lcd to become visible to the viewer unlike standard crt and plasma televisions since there are no phosphors that light up less power is need for operation and the light source in an lcd television generates less heat than a plasma or traditional television also because of the nature of lcd technology there is no radiation emitted from the screen itself plasma television advantages for plasma televisions the advantages over lcd are better contrast ratio better ability to render deep blacks more color depth better motion tracking response time and more availability in very large screen sizes plasma television disadvantages however the disadvantages of plasma vs lcd include more susceptible to burn in although this is not as much of a factor now due to technology improvements in the past couple of years more heat generation does not perform as well at higher altitudes and shorter display life span although this too is changing due to technology improvements heavier weight and more delicate to ship lcd television advantages lcd television advantages include no burn in susceptibility cooler running less screen glare more functional at high altitudes longer display life although improvements are being made in plasma screen life looks better in brightly lit rooms also lcd televisions have made great strides in upping the ante in native pixel resolution with a growing number of sets offering a full p x display capability at affordable price levels in screen sizes ranging from inches and up on the other hand the number of plasma televisions offering p native pixel resolution are still few and far between as well as being more expensive in comparison to their lcd counterparts one factor to consider in favor of lcd over plasma at least for the near future is that if you are planning to purchase a blu ray disc hd dvd or upscaling dvd player lcd may be a more cost effective option as you can get a p lcd set from to inches at a lower price than and inch size plasma set that has p resolution one other factor to consider is that lcd televisions are typically lighter when comparing same screen sizes than their plasma counterparts making wall installation easier lcd television disadvantages lcd televisions do have drawbacks in several areas vs plasma televisions lower contrast ratio not as good rendering deep blacks not as good at tracking motion although this is improving and not as common in large screen sizes above inches although the number is growing also although lcd televisions do not suffer from burn in susceptibility it is possible that individual pixels on an lcd televisions can burn out causing small visible black or white dots to appear on the screen individual pixels cannot be repaired the whole screen would need to be replaced at that point if the individual pixel burnout becomes annoying to you finally lcd televisions are more expensive than an equivalent sized plasma television although the price gap is closing the mercury issue also one argument that plasma television manufacturers are making about lcd televisions is that they use mercury as part of the chemical makeup of the florescent lighting used to illuminate the screen surface however this is a red herring with regards to choosing a plasma television over an lcd television in lcd sets the amount of mercury used is not only small it never comes in contact with the user also keep in mind that most common high efficiency florescent lamps also use mercury mercury is one of the earth's elements its existence in nature is a part of natural processes and has both beneficial and non beneficial uses just as most other elements and chemical compounds you are probably in more danger eating fish that may contain traces of mercury a couple of times a week than watching touching or using an lcd tv also with the development of led lighting sources which is mercury free this issue will resolve itself in the years ahead lcd television and hdtv reception on the hdtv part of the equation most lcd televisions already have built in standard tv tuners hdtv tuners must usually be added externally but more are showing up as a standard feature while many plasmas are just monitors only and may require both external standard and hdtv tuners to receive television signals although more are beginning to include either ntsc and or both hdtv tuners this is definitely a point to check when making your buying decision as it will affect your budget my recommendation is to go to a dealer and really take a look carefully at several plasma and lcd televisions and compare the performance based on the above factors and narrow down your choices to one or two of both types and make your decision based on what type will give you the most pleasing image connection flexibility and fits your overall budget expectations however both flat panel plasma and lcd televisions are viable options for home theater and with prices continuing to come down and features and quality continuing to go up both types are quickly becoming a good value for consumers

hdtv novice i am looking to purchase a lcd hdtv set please excuse the novice questions confused about info from varying sources the main thing is i am on a tight budget college student budget so i was wondering how wise is it to purchase a refurbished television set looking for a or model would one be a better choice for me i plan on using the set to not only use a television set but as a computer monitor and gaming monitor i have read that there is not much difference between to contrast ratio so should i be fine with a contrast ratio with a ms response time will i see ghosting with the ms time while playing video games finally are any of these brands worthwhile westinghouse vizio viewsonic figured since i'm budget conscious going to stores to see tvs wouldn't help since they all have name brand sony toshiba etc i'm not a videophile but am used to crt have yet to see hd on a set so what you guys are suggesting is to stay away from brands like westinghouse and vizio i just simply cannot afford a toshiba or sony at for a television i'm not necessarily looking a permanent television but one for the upcoming year range i have seen refurbished westinghouses for range for a contrast ms ms is this not a good deal i know i may be unrealistic with my price range of with lower being better is there any specific television models and or sites thanks for quick responses haha a quick note about the drunk college student comment known all about it even lived in a frat house would never do it again but tons of lasting memories and lack of at the same time however i am a settled down sr so i probably will keep my tv on a stand the comment about all brands have the same manufactuers how can i find this info also if this is true there most be a lowest costing non name brand that is the best bargain since it will have the same hardware as other name brand systems with a different casing just reiterating i am bargain shopper you seem to have a good handle on your information yes lcd with ms response and is all good refurbished is just a tv that has been sent thru the manufacturing line a nd time nothing wrong or bad with refurbished in fact i'd rather see you buy a known brand name that's refurbished than to buy a brand new vizio or westinghouse tv set once those new brand name tv sets fail it's not possible to repair them locally you have to ship it to the manufacturer shipping is not unusual i only have one suggestion when you take it to college mount it as high as you can above your bed no doubt you will have one drunken azzhole come into your room and face plant himself onto every inch of wallspace you have and lcds won't handle him very well so make sure it's well above feet or higher that idiot won't have any money to repair your tv  High-definition television PlayStation 3 Plasma display Liquid crystal display television Liquid crystal display Laserdisc Floppy disk Microeconomics IBM PC compatible Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Laptop Nintendo PlayStation 2 PlayStation Portable Digital television Nintendo Revolution Oscilloscope Cathode ray tube DVD Cell (microprocessor) Commodore International Teletext Gamut Atari 8-bit family Sega Saturn PowerBook TiVo Xbox 360 Xbox Sears Holdings Corporation Computer and video games Apple Macintosh Handheld game console Iowa class battleship Sega Trademark Law of value CPU cache Economics MP3 Bluetooth Poker jargon ATI Technologies Commodore 64 Amiga Atari ST Pixel 1080p Computer display Electronic commerce Apple II family R46 (New York City Subway car) Loudspeaker Nintendo GameCube Sinclair Research Ltd Blackjack Nintendo 64 MMORPG Mattress Game programming IPod Final Fantasy XI CPU design Management information system Bicycle lighting Embedded system Capitalism History of computer and video games In The Groove (game) High fidelity Internet fraud Debugging Redundant array of independent disks Overclocking Battery electric vehicle Apple Computer Atari 2600 Nintendo DS Sega Dreamcast View camera RISC CBS Digital Visual Interface Windows 2000 Tier One RFID Color Transformation problem

panasonic crt ripped out cable connector i have a panasonic crt and in trying to move it i stupidly ripped out the cable connector in the back the little thing that sticks out that the cable screws onto anybody know if this can be repaired and what it might cost to repair thanks probably not worth repairing but if you have an old vcr or a dvd recorder with a built in tuner and your tv has video line level inputs you could use the tuner in the dvd or vcr to view cable channels to directly answer your question yes it can be repaired for a few dollars more you could probably buy a new set  Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting SCART Television S-VHS Videocassette recorder Oscilloscope DVD Panasonic Camcorder S-Video Home cinema Digital video recorder High fidelity TiVo Set-top box Cable television S__CAM RCA connector Videotape Composite video High-definition television Composite monitor VHS Secure Digital card Sound Blaster Atari 8-bit family Atari 2600 Cathode ray tube Xbox Digital Visual Interface Macrovision DV XLR connector Ethernet D-subminiature Teletext Advanced Technology Attachment Nintendo Entertainment System RS-232 TRS-80 Xbox 360 Coaxial cable Compact disc Federal Communications Commission PAL Universal Serial Bus Liquid crystal display television PC Engine Digital photography Floppy disk Copy protection PlayStation Portable Sega Dreamcast MythTV Betacam Nintendo GameCube SCSI Phantom power Live Aid Lighting Commodore 64 Sound card DVD recorder Archos Betamax Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis TurboGrafx 16 Laptop IMac Jack plug DVD player High-Definition Multimedia Interface ATI Technologies Microeconomics Nintendo Revolution MII (videocassette format) Modem PlayStation 2 Pirate decryption Digital television DMX (lighting) Balanced audio 1080p 8 mm video format Quizbowl Embedded system Violin Leica Film TIA-568A/B Gamma correction Karaoke Liquid crystal display PowerBook Cruising (maritime) TV tuner card Computer-aided design

plasma vs lcd i hear ppl sayin how lcd is better than plasma but whats the difference between the thanx jim outward appearances are definitely deceiving when it comes to lcd and plasma televisions although both types of televisions are flat and thin they employ different technology in an attempt to deliver similar results plasma tv overview plasma television technology is based loosely on the fluorescent light bulb the display itself consists of cells within each cell two glass panels are separated by a narrow gap in which neon xenon gas is injected and sealed in plasma form during the manufacturing process the gas is electrically charged at specific intervals when the plasma set is in use the charged gas then strikes red green and blue phosphors thus creating a television image each group of red green and blue phosphors is called a pixel picture element although plasma television technology eliminate the need for the bulky picture tube and electron beam scanning of traditional televisions because it still employs the burning of phosphors to generate an image plasma televisions still suffer from some of the drawbacks of traditional televisions such as heat generation and screen burn of static images lcd tv overview lcd televisions on the other hand use a different technology see also question for this same explanation basically lcd panels are made of two layers of transparent material which are polarized and are glued together one of the layers is coated with a special polymer that holds the individual liquid crystals current is then passed through individual crystals which allow the crystals to pass or block light to create images lcd crystals do not produce their own light so an external light source such as florescent bulb is needed for the image created by the lcd to become visible to the viewer unlike standard crt and plasma televisions since there are no phosphors that light up less power is need for operation and the light source in an lcd television generates less heat than a plasma or traditional television also because of the nature of lcd technology there is no radiation emitted from the screen itself plasma television advantages for plasma televisions the advantages over lcd are better contrast ratio better ability to render deep blacks more color depth better motion tracking response time and more availability in very large screen sizes plasma television disadvantages however the disadvantages of plasma vs lcd include more susceptible to burn in although this is not as much of a factor now due to technology improvements in the past couple of years more heat generation does not perform as well at higher altitudes and shorter display life span although this too is changing due to technology improvements heavier weight and more delicate to ship lcd television advantages lcd television advantages include no burn in susceptibility cooler running less screen glare more functional at high altitudes longer display life although improvements are being made in plasma screen life looks better in brightly lit rooms also lcd televisions have made great strides in upping the ante in native pixel resolution with a growing number of sets offering a full p x display capability at affordable price levels in screen sizes ranging from inches and up on the other hand the number of plasma televisions offering p native pixel resolution are still few and far between as well as being more expensive in comparison to their lcd counterparts one factor to consider in favor of lcd over plasma at least for the near future is that if you are planning to purchase a blu ray disc hd dvd or upscaling dvd player lcd may be a more cost effective option as you can get a p lcd set from to inches at a lower price than and inch size plasma set that has p resolution one other factor to consider is that lcd televisions are typically lighter when comparing same screen sizes than their plasma counterparts making wall installation easier lcd television disadvantages lcd televisions do have drawbacks in several areas vs plasma televisions lower contrast ratio not as good rendering deep blacks not as good at tracking motion although this is improving and not as common in large screen sizes above inches although the number is growing also although lcd televisions do not suffer from burn in susceptibility it is possible that individual pixels on an lcd televisions can burn out causing small visible black or white dots to appear on the screen individual pixels cannot be repaired the whole screen would need to be replaced at that point if the individual pixel burnout becomes annoying to you finally lcd televisions are more expensive than an equivalent sized plasma television although the price gap is closing the mercury issue also one argument that plasma television manufacturers are making about lcd televisions is that they use mercury as part of the chemical makeup of the florescent lighting used to illuminate the screen surface however this is a red herring with regards to choosing a plasma television over an lcd television in lcd sets the amount of mercury used is not only small it never comes in contact with the user also keep in mind that most common high efficiency florescent lamps also use mercury mercury is one of the earth's elements its existence in nature is a part of natural processes and has both beneficial and non beneficial uses just as most other elements and chemical compounds you are probably in more danger eating fish that may contain traces of mercury a couple of times a week than watching touching or using an lcd tv also with the development of led lighting sources which is mercury free this issue will resolve itself in the years ahead lcd television and hdtv reception on the hdtv part of the equation most lcd televisions already have built in standard tv tuners hdtv tuners must usually be added externally but more are showing up as a standard feature while many plasmas are just monitors only and may require both external standard and hdtv tuners to receive television signals although more are beginning to include either ntsc and or both hdtv tuners this is definitely a point to check when making your buying decision as it will affect your budget my recommendation is to go to a dealer and really take a look carefully at several plasma and lcd televisions and compare the performance based on the above factors and narrow down your choices to one or two of both types and make your decision based on what type will give you the most pleasing image connection flexibility and fits your overall budget expectations however both flat panel plasma and lcd televisions are viable options for home theater and with prices continuing to come down and features and quality continuing to go up both types are quickly becoming a good value for consumers

the alignment on my hitachi hdtv has gone array how can i realign it the picture is overlapping i have had it in the shop they say its fixed but its not they tell me once you move a big screen tv that is can't be alligned because of the transport i think this is bull so i will try myself there is buttons on the remote and i can get into programming different things but i can't seem to get it to take the alignment i have never in all my years of service found a tv i could not align very closely if not perfectly the idea of moving the set knocking it out of alignment is utter nonsense unless you tossed it out of your truck or dropped it take it back where you had it repaired and insist upon a full convergence alignment if they do not and they are hitachi authorized try giving hitachi a call hitachi the technician that performed the repair might have missed one or more burned out resistors in the convergence circuit  Hitachi, Ltd.

whats better lcd or plasma well i want to purchase a tv and i really don't know whats better i want a good tv that will last me a good years and has very good quality so should i choose a lcd or a plasma also what company should i go for i heard sony is the best but i'm not sure gimme any suggestions of good tv's thanks well both have certain benefits but overall lcd is probably going to be your choice since it is inherently designed to last longer than years you see semiconductor based equipment can last indefinitely but due to flaws in the material it does not last forever lcd is semiconductor based while plasma is designed to be a design based on ionizing gases when you ionize gas it changes the gases ability to conduct and phosphor does darken as the ions strike the phosphor it can last long but it does have a limited life to it that's the main reason lcd is preferred longevity is built into it but let's look at some problems i've seen in the real world lcd is easily damaged by little children i've had four customers who purchased lcd panel tvs and their to year olds have smashed the panels with rocks marbles cut the panel with scissors and stones it's not kid proof the plasmas can handle kids better plasmas generate a lot of heat can have glare problems in really sunlit rooms easily damaged if dropped low end lcds will show screen lag on fast action it really shows up in sports and games so you want an ms or better response time on the lcd crystals lcd panels don't burn but plasmas do not good on paused pictures or msnbc cnn or any display that doesn't shift on the screen when it comes down to lcd sony is the leader and if you want the best right now look for the wax chassis out now they have motion flow technology which refreshes the frame times to most lcds that only do it one time this gives you a razor sharp picture with hi speed action like games and sports the xbr model line is one of the wax chassis  Plasma display Liquid crystal display television Light-emitting diode Cathode ray tube Fluorescent lamp Oscilloscope Plasma (physics) Stereoscopy Television Vacuum tube TFT LCD Digital photography Gas tungsten arc welding Diode Spacecraft propulsion Handheld game console Konica Minolta Movie projector Solar cell Laser Laptop Gamut Computer display Welding Glass Vacuum IMac Solar wind Nuclear power Windows XP Internal ballistics Fusor PlayStation Portable Gramophone record Gameplay of StarCraft Tank Sega Dreamcast Solar power Fusion power PlayStation 3 Nuclear fusion Mouse (computing) Helium PowerBook Turbocharger Nintendo Semiconductor device Loudspeaker Team Fortress Classic Casting Combine (Half-Life 2) Organic light-emitting diode Nintendo Virtual Boy Electrophysiology Corona discharge Ceramics Universal Century Technology Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Tesla coil Sharp Zaurus Directed-energy weapon Transistor Photography Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Laserdisc Mass spectrometry Ionizing radiation Langmuir probe Fluorine Sun Super Nintendo Entertainment System Equine conformation Knife DLP Synthetic diamond Microeconomics Gas metal arc welding Railgun Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Quake III Arena Ionosphere Pixel Boeing 737 Fluoroscopy De Lorean DMC-12 X-ray MP3 RoadShow Defense of the Ancients Carbon dioxide Digital rights management

television repair help please i have a television with a vcr dvd combo on it i had a tape stuck in the vcr but finially managed to get the tape out problem is that everytime i turn on my television it shuts off after about seconds i was browsing through questions and found someone who had a very similar question someone told this person that they would probably have to set the vcr mode but how do i do that not set the vcr mode reset the mode switch that involves taking apart the vcr section and rewinding the loading motor mechanism to it's stopped state then reinstalling the loading tray if it isn't damaged the mode switch should now function which allows the vcr to provide some of the low voltages that are used by the tv set to run when it's bad it shuts down the vcr and the vcr shuts off the tv it's not easy to retime the mode switch  SCART Videocassette recorder VHS Digital video recorder Copy protection Floppy disk Laserdisc Embedded system Electric motor Betamax Oscilloscope Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Toyota Prius CPU design Booting S-VHS Television Radiation hardening Macrovision Uninterruptible power supply Digital circuit Camcorder Ethernet Windows XP Electronic amplifier Windows 2000 Commodore 64 Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Whose Line Is It Anyway? 8 mm video format Halting problem Relay Central processing unit Kernel (computer science) Airsoft Compact disc GunZ The Duel Atari 8-bit family Switch Galileo spacecraft Diablo II: Lord of Destruction PlayStation Portable Canon T90 IPod Manual transmission Thermostat ZX Spectrum Betacam Crossbar switch Transistor M16 (rifle) Hybrid Synergy Drive Diablo II Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Steam (content delivery) Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Virtual memory DV Elevator Hybrid vehicle Control-Alt-Delete Universal Serial Bus Teletext Firearm Variable Frequency Drive Guilty Gear Switched-mode power supply RS-232 Capacitor plague Hard disk Federal Standard 1037C Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Acorn Electron Wind turbine TGV Vacuum tube Remote control Cable television IBM PC compatible Terran (StarCraft) Heinkel He 100 USB flash drive Computer multitasking Nintendo Entertainment System Potentiometer Electrophysiology High-voltage direct current Video 2000 Welding Emacs STS-61 Motorcycle Mach kernel Transformer Rail terminology Pump It Up
