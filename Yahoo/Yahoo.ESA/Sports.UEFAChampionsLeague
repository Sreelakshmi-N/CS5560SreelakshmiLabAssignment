why can't people accept milan as the best club in the world i don't understand this but some people think liverpool or manchester united or even chelsea ar unrivalled in the world game without any history to back that up and then there are the barca idiots who just do not know of the actual achievements of their stupid team why cant people make a simple distinction that most popular team or player is not the best team in the world or europe let's all accept unanimously that milan are the gods of football and continue with peace and awe of this fact let's just say that everyone like to think that the club they support is the best is in the human nature not to agree with those who think different than you do if you take a look at ac milan history numbers show only one of the best teams in europe real madrid has more champions league trophies and juventus has more serie a titles but if you analyze all this together it very clear to me that ac milan is the best team in europe numbers say so the players they had and have may not ever be the most popular but the bounds between them were always very strong and that's what it takes to be the best they had over the year ups and downs it's true but what team didn't there are lots to say on this subject too many examples to show but if you are a true soccer fan and really want to know who's the best team you have to do some digging and than open your mouth and i'll say it again ac milan is the greatest team ever why i say that constancy first of all that's just my opinion  UEFA Champions League Real Madrid Alex Ferguson Newcastle United F.C.

how why do the epl and uefa champions league play at the same time and which is more prestigeous champion's league is the continental competition and as such is the more prestigious for the most part the epl and the uefa competitions are not at the same time on the rare dates when there is a conflict the epl game is postponed until a later date when there is no uefa competition scheduled for either of the two teams it is hard on the teams to play in essentially four competitions at roughly the same time epl uefa fa cup and carling cup for some of the players who also participate on their national team which typically have euro or world cup qualifying however the competitions are scheduled so that the games are not too close together but the teams involved typically have both a weekend and a mid week match the money that a team gets for playing in europe helps them have a little bit deeper bench which helps with handling the added games  UEFA Champions League Football (soccer) UEFA Cup FA Cup League Cup Bundesliga (football) UEFA National Football League Football World Cup Football in England Playoff The Football League Michael Owen Playoff format FIFA Celtic F.C.

why do you say is the best every one think his favourit team is the best ever to play in europe but none prove that so can you prove that the team you support it's really the best soccer demon i like your answer and you seam to be right but you are not entirely i love ac milan for a long long time and i think is the best team in europe and because of soccer demon i'll make a comparison between barcelona and milan maybe i'm wrong who knows domestic competition home championship titles barca milan thumb up for barca milan lost title lately and we all know why cup winners barca milan no comment here supercup barca milan still one point for barca so far barca seams to be the best by far international competition uefa champions league former european cup barca milan hmmm big difference uefa cup winners cup barca ac milan tied score here european super cup barca milan not that relevant because the super cup is off season so teams are playing more or less world club championship former intercontinental cup barca milan still not so relevant 'cause europe has the best football i will not count the rest of the trophies 'cause they are insignificant both for barca and for milan so this is how i see it barcelona won indeed more domestic titles than milan but on the european level milan is by far better both la liga and serie a are strong championships lots of competitive team but still in europe are gattering the best team from all the contries especially in champions league and to be the best is much more demanding that at home just because you have to face so many diferent kinds of playing interesting records speak for milan milan hold the unique record of having gone a whole season without losing a game during the season in total that unbeaten streak lasted games starting with a draw with parma on may and ironically ending with a loss at home to parma on march this unbeaten streak is a serie a record and is the rd longest unbeaten run in top flight european football behind steaua bucharest record of games unbeaten and glasgow celtic who went games unbeaten have a great week end  FA Cup Cork City F.C.

fernando torres when the reds signed torres i was soooo happy finally a class striker but later i realized torres wood have to have time to adjust no doubt the talent is there and i think rafa can shape him well but could the million pounds be spent better he has never scored more than goals in a season i like torres but in my opinion i wood want a proven goalscorer for tht much david villa maybe goals torres tho helps a team more than just scoring goals hes a playmaker it will take some time to adjust tho thts besides the point how wood u have spent tht million be realistic can torres live up to his price tag torres has lived in spain all his life so it will take him a while to get used to his new surroundings in liverpool personally as a watford fan million could buy us a new squad but for liverpool i dont have a clue what positions need strenghtening  Aston Villa F.C.
