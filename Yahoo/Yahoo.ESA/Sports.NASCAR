is richard petty's record sort of like what barry bonds has just done in baseball i ask this because watching the historical accomplishment of hitting the most homeruns got me thinking about the king winning the most races you have to look at it in context and the situations surrounding them as they did their remarkable feats both are all time greats but are they the best ever petty and bonds would probably both be on almost everyone's top or lists in their respective sports but how many people will still put them even though there are valid questions as to how they did what they did i was just wondering if this made anyone else think about stuff and what those thoughts are i'm not trying to disrespect richard petty he's still an all time great and did a lot towards building the popularity of nascar matt c you're right about how most fans feel about each as a person but i don't know that everyone would say petty's record is shining gold he raced in an era of almost races a year until the modern era with some of those only being car fields the rules and regulations were a joke and who can forget the season where nobody had an answer to the supersized mopar engines it could be said that some of the king's cars were on steroids but yes he still had to drive them skillfully there are similarities and differences in comparing bonds and petty both hold records for what the fans of the respective sports deem extremely important petty wins bonds home runs both also accomplished their feats by having arguably superior equipment or in bonds' case i guess i should say it as equipment however i think the main difference between bonds and petty lies in the fans views toward them bonds is looked down on and dismissed by the fans and is carrying little respect and adoration with him into the record books while petty on the other hand is loved by everyone that could possibly call themselves nascar fans so in saying that i can't really compare petty's record to bonds' long story short according to the majority of the both fan bases respectively bonds' record is tainted petty's is shining gold  Barry Bonds Baseball Sports timeline Richard Petty Troy Glaus St. Louis Cardinals NASCAR Dale Earnhardt Hendrick Motorsports Andr__s Galarraga Hank Aaron Darrell Waltrip NEXTEL Cup Babe Ruth San Francisco Giants Theory of conduct Penske Racing Auto racing New York Yankees Formula One Indianapolis 500 Dodge Charger Jeff Gordon Willie Mays Billboard Hot 100 Terry Labonte Bristol Motor Speedway Ted Williams Alex Rodriguez Major League Baseball television contracts Toronto Blue Jays Appeal History of baseball in the United States Major League Baseball Starfleet ranks and insignia Boston Red Sox Baseball Stars Drag racing James Bond Bobby Allison Talladega Superspeedway Chicago White Sox V8 Supercar Game show Table tennis Kevin Harvick The Jim Rome Show One Tree Hill (TV series) Tom Petty Tony Stewart Shaggy dog story Stock car racing New York Jets Chip Ganassi Racing Evernham Motorsports Nolan Ryan Roush Racing Softball The Game (rapper) Jos__ Canseco Playoff Warrant Officer Sammy Sosa Whose Line Is It Anyway?

who thinks that of races is a small i my self say that is more than the season that is effected how can you consider that as being a small percentage if nascar feels the need to run saturday night races they should consider running them in march early april then again in october the local tracks some of them don't start until april and are finished by the end of september and how to the answer that yes nascar cares because many local track have weekly nascar sanctioned races how does that prove they care i am still trying to figure out what these tracks get from nascar by running there series all i see is the tracks charging twice the amount of money and paying the least amount how can be small it's over half i don't think nascar even considers this in their decisions it's outside their realm of caring unfortunately go jr  NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Craftsman Truck Series Stock car racing Auto racing Bristol Motor Speedway Ernie Irvan Watkins Glen International NASCAR Realignment Tony Stewart Penske Racing Roush Racing Joe Gibbs Kyle Busch NASCAR Rookie of the Year Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Kevin Harvick Drag racing Rich Bickle Geoff Bodine New Hampshire International Speedway Busch Series Sterling Marlin Nashville Superspeedway Formula One racing Billboard Hot 100 Indianapolis Motor Speedway Jimmie Johnson Darlington Raceway Herb Thomas Talladega Superspeedway Greg Sacks Martin Truex Jr. The Amazing Race Dale Earnhardt Lake Speed Formula One Carl Edwards Terry Labonte Hendrick Motorsports International Motor Sports Association Chip Ganassi Racing Casey Atwood Matt Kenseth Jeff Green (NASCAR) Lowe's Motor Speedway Daytona International Speedway Blackjack Mark Martin (NASCAR) Bobby Hamilton Indianapolis 500 NASCAR Video Games California Speedway Ayrton Senna Ashton Lewis Fox Broadcasting Company Dan Gurney May 2005 in sports Sim racing Evernham Motorsports Richard Petty Indy Racing League Grand-Am Jamie McMurray Yu-Gi-Oh!

doesn't the racing community care about the local tracks with the answers i was given to the question why so many saturday night races in cup i felt the need to ask this question i agree racing under the lights is awesome but you can go to your local track on saturday night and see some awesome races and support the next generation of drivers in the mean time the only thing nascar cares about local tracks id the sponsor fee for letting you use there name at your track i don't think nascar run enough saturday night races in the season to really hurt the local tracks and plus their tv audience is dropping due to the antics in the front office i know our local track isn't a nascar money sucking track and we were sold out last weekend and the weekend before that too it use to be a nascar track but they dropped them when they seen what they were really about in there pocket your saturday night races other than bristol and it maybe there too but the night races came about because of the heat of sitting and driving in the south during the heat of the day that is why talladega races were moved also spring and fall  Ernie Irvan NASCAR Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Talladega Superspeedway Bristol Motor Speedway NASCAR Realignment Darlington Raceway Tony Stewart Stock car racing Hendrick Motorsports Roush Racing Terry Labonte Drag racing Richard Childress Racing Evernham Motorsports Busch Series NEXTEL Cup Auto racing Formula One Chip Ganassi Racing Greg Sacks Indianapolis 500 NASCAR Thunder 2004 Craftsman Truck Series Geoff Bodine Saturday Night Live Penske Racing Formula One racing Sterling Marlin Jeff Gordon Bobby Hamilton Kevin Harvick New Hampshire International Speedway Morgan-McClure Motorsports Kyle Busch Powerbomb Ayrton Senna MB2/MBV Motorsports Bill Elliott Martin Truex Jr. Tim Richmond Jimmie Johnson Have I Got News For You Bill Davis Racing Sim racing Mark Martin (NASCAR) Brett Bodine NASCAR Video Games Rusty Wallace Dover International Speedway NASCAR Rookie of the Year Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Grand Prix Legends Riverside International Raceway Richard Petty Bobby Allison Indianapolis Motor Speedway Dirt track racing Rich Bickle Darrell Waltrip May 2005 in sports Adam Petty Restrictor plates Casey Atwood Professional wrestling throws Matt Kenseth Atlanta Motor Speedway Tobacco advertising Joe Gibbs Racing Weekend Update (sketch) Nashville Superspeedway The Adventures of Pete & Pete Bobby Hillin, Jr. Jeff Green (NASCAR) Major League Baseball television contracts Plymouth Superbird Alan Kulwicki Mike Alfonso California Speedway Robby Gordon Safety car Bon Jovi Elliott Sadler Friends Carburetor Rosa Parks Las Vegas Motor Speedway Pocono Raceway Texas Motor Speedway Dale Earnhardt, Inc.

why doesn't nascar seperate busch from nextel cup i am trying to understand why robby gordon was benched in his nextel cup race for something he did in a busch race that just doesn't make any sense to me how do the rest of you feel someone please explain drivers get one nascar license not one for each series as a result of his actions nascar pulled robby gordon's license for remainder of the weekend meaning he could not race in the cup series race that is the same thing they did with kevin harvick when he was penalized for rough driving in the truck series nascar took emergency action as allowed in the rulebook and pulled his license its not any different when crew chiefs are suspended either when the crew chiefs serve suspensions they can not be involved in any nascar event not just in nextel cup  Kevin Harvick Richard Childress Racing NEXTEL Cup Tony Stewart NASCAR Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Craftsman Truck Series NASCAR Rookie of the Year Kyle Busch Roush Racing Robby Gordon Lowe's Motor Speedway Penske Racing Busch Series Dale Earnhardt, Inc.

did earnhardt jr win its about time the bum won a race if he figgures to hang around nascar very long no he didn't win but he will when his contract negotiations came into play i did not care where he went as long as it was with rcr gibbs or hendrick in which case he did he needs that strong leadership of these types of organizations i think next year we will all see a difference in jr's perfomance and dispel once and for all that he can drive he has two busch championships lest anyone forget that and since he has been in cup he lost his icon of a father and has had to carry the name the organization and everything else on his shoulders he didn't even own the rights to his own name until last year so i think with that said lets give jr time to come into his own i think we will see good things for him to the dismay of all the jr haters i am sure  Hendrick Motorsports Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Richard Childress Racing Roush Racing Kevin Harvick NASCAR Dale Earnhardt Tony Stewart Terry Labonte Jeff Gordon NASCAR Rookie of the Year NEXTEL Cup Penske Racing Joe Gibbs Tim Richmond Greg Sacks Kyle Busch Jeff Green (NASCAR) Kurt Busch Martin Truex Jr. Jimmie Johnson Craftsman Truck Series Busch Series Bill Davis Racing Darrell Waltrip Chip Ganassi Racing Geoff Bodine Joe Gibbs Racing Richard Petty Stock car racing FC Rostov Carl Edwards Jason Leffler Derrike Cope Casey Atwood Talladega Superspeedway Rusty Wallace Matt Kenseth Lake Speed Daytona International Speedway Bristol Motor Speedway Evernham Motorsports Rich Bickle Bobby Hillin, Jr. MB2/MBV Motorsports Watkins Glen International International Race of Champions Brett Bodine New Hampshire International Speedway Auto racing Adam Petty Jamie McMurray NASCAR Realignment Mark Martin (NASCAR) California Speedway Detroit Red Wings Riverside International Raceway Dover International Speedway Sterling Marlin NASCAR Thunder 2004 October 2004 in sports NASCAR 2005: Chase for the Cup Atlanta Motor Speedway Bill Elliott JJ Yeley Brazil national football team Washington Redskins Neil Bonnett June 2005 in sports Reggie Jackson Greg Biffle Harry Hyde Robby Gordon Pocono Raceway Adrian Fernandez Trade union Bobby Hamilton Elliott Sadler Nashville Superspeedway Christian Fittipaldi Chris Amon Lowe's Motor Speedway Tennessee Titans Shawn Michaels Brian Close Alcohol advertising Alan Kulwicki Indianapolis Motor Speedway Norway national football team St. Louis Cardinals Kyle Petty Felix Sabates Contract May 2005 in sports Nick Faldo English cricket team Table tennis Denis Law

did nascar show its best or worst side in canada article on yahoo said nascar brought the best and worst to canada i think the worst was the best after that race i bet next year the crowds will be even bigger i think nascar owes robby a little thanks i can't speak for my fellow canadians but i don't think gordon's actions are going to cause many to jump off the nascar bandwagon up here it's funny that they'd even worry about it so much given that there are many of us who are already more than a little familiar with nascar you're not going to find jeff gordon on any pepsi machines here but it's not like we don't get coverage of every race the same as you do i've noticed little dropoff really since moving back to canada for fans who are on the fence about nascar in canada it's tough to determine which way they'll go so many of my canadian friends love f that it will be hard to convince them that racing three wide is the better choice but i just try telling them that it beats the heck out of watching an f race where the first lap leader is usually the guy who wins the race  Tony Stewart Hendrick Motorsports Jeff Gordon NEXTEL Cup Richard Petty Darrell Waltrip Indianapolis 500 NASCAR Roush Racing Greg Sacks Casey Atwood Kevin Harvick Richard Childress Racing Talladega Superspeedway Robby Gordon Dale Earnhardt, Inc.

robby fined nascar has announced its fine for robby grodon k and probation for the rest of the year pretty light if you asked me but i think its nascar admitting they had a part in the whole thing if they felt they were right nascar would have slapped him much harder thoughts hmm that's an odd amount it's like we have to fine him more than k because we suspended him but we probably shouldn't have penalized him at all so let's make it look semi legitimate with a fine maybe nascar nation won't figure it out and we can discretely move on with the season that's what that says to me anyway probation that's the biggest joke of a penalty that nascar has who isn't on probation right now other than maybe jeff burton and bobby labonte have you ever seen a guy on probation that actually got in deeper trouble because of it  Tony Stewart Richard Childress Racing Hendrick Motorsports Kevin Harvick Roush Racing NASCAR Rookie of the Year Chip Ganassi Racing Bill Davis Racing Dale Earnhardt, Inc.

where are the lug nuts on a nascar wheel found and how do they change them so fast the lug nuts on the wheels are in the same place as any other wheel of them around the center peg the pegs that the lugs go on are made out of carbon fibre so if a lug nut is put on crooked it strips the lug and not the peg if a peg is damaged the whole wheel assembly has to be replaced as for changing them it takes lots of practice and a few tricks for example the lug nuts are glued on the tires so there is no time wasted in threading and in the socket of the gun there is a spring loaded release so when the lug nut is removed from the wheel it is shot out of the socket by the spring so you don't have to manually remove the lug nut from the socket also the changers keep the socket spinning the whole time rather than starting it to do a lug and stopping it after finishing that single lug also when removing a lug they don't hold the socket on the lug the whole time they just tap it and remove the socket and the lug nut just spins off by itself also making it quicker so with all of these tricks and lots of practice on hitting the lugs it allows changers to change tires extrememly quickly  Tire Bicycle frame Screw Wrench NASCAR Skateboarding trick Internal ballistics Violin Textile manufacturing Drag racing Rigging Krag-J__rgensen Wire wrap Indianapolis 500 Aerial (dance move) Cello Disc brake Fuse (electrical) Four wheel drive Casting Dodge Charger Manual transmission Skateboarding Windows XP Climbing equipment Lawn mower Winning Streak Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Spark plug Chevrolet Corvair Metroid Prime Coir Toyota Prius Lake Speed Car handling B-47 Stratojet Double bass BS 1363 M16 (rifle) Diablo II Wheel of Fortune IPod Bubble Bobble Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Mars Exploration Rover Penske Racing D-subminiature Tom-tom drum Chevrolet Corvette Pentium 4 AK-47 Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Rifle 2000 Australian Grand Prix Firearm Lincoln LS Lee-Enfield Atari 2600 Doom enemies Universal Serial Bus Suicide methods Formula One regulations Professional wrestling attacks Transmission (mechanics) Clinker (boat building) Glossary of climbing terms Ernie Irvan T-72 Heckler & Koch G3 Carbon fiber Ayrton Senna Professional wrestling holds Incandescent light bulb Revolver Toyota MR2 Fuel efficiency Hubcap Dodge Neon Drifting (motorsport) Ford Ranger EV Rail terminology Lute Weaving Swingout Quake III Arena Fast bowling Tractor Domain Name System Cotton Anti-aircraft warfare Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Meccano The Midnight Sun BMW M5 Thread (computer science) Skateboard

what's your all thoughts about robby gordon and his actions on saturday i'm surprised with all of the robbie gordon apologists if you are a a true racing fan you should be disappointed or even angry at what happened on saturday mr gordon didn't deserve to win or finish second the reason why he was put back to thirteenth was because he failed to maintain a cautious speed and passed cars under yellow nascar didn't even penalize him for blasting marcos when he caught up to him under caution what mr gordon did on saturday was dangerous and stupid if he only sits out one race he got off lightly robbie apologists wait till your guy is treated unfairly so you truly justify your anger at nascar  Indianapolis 500 Robby Gordon Jeff Gordon Penske Racing Hendrick Motorsports Casey Atwood Richard Childress Racing Chip Ganassi Racing Roush Racing NASCAR 2002 Tour de France Talladega Superspeedway Tony Stewart Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Leeds United F.C.

what kind of cranks do the nascar engines have and who grinds their cams do they have to use a stock block if not what kind and what kind of rods do they use i know the heads are the secret but what about everythingelse i have been to nascar alot and have not seen anything that describes engine specs john go find a circle jerk and be the hub let me start by saying that nascar rules and regulations are always subject to change as are teams and the way they operate this information is accurate to the best of my abilities pretty much the only engine parts that come from the manufacturer gm ford dodge are the block and the heads and both are bare and not even remotely stock the gm block for example doesn't even have a place to mount an oil filter the displacement can be no less than ci and no more than ci virtually everything else is aftermarket usually designed exclusively for nascar for example chip gannasi racing's suppliers include mike bordeaux dyno cams comp cams trend and smith brothers pushrods del west and xceldyne valves jesel belt drives t d rockers lentz connecting rods sonny bryant cranks johnson oil pumps clevite engine bearings je pistons fel pro gaskets and bosch plugs and alternators every engine for every team uses a holley carb all teams have specs their common parts must comply to regardless of where they come from for example pistons can't weigh less than grams con rods grams and wrist pins grams the max compression ratio is and the max exhaust diameter is except for the tips they have an unusual spec because they are flattened out i don't remember what it is for sure but something like no more than wide each or combined different teams have different shops who do their machining for example joe gibbs racing sends their heads to cfe racing products in michigan and ganassi has ernie elliott in georgia do all their machine work the average lifespan of the parts are different and engines are torn down after every race so an engine used in one race may not have all the same parts in it as it did in an earlier race blocks are usually good for races heads races cranks races cams lifters and pushrods races connecting rods and rocker arms races and pistons valves and valve springs are replaced after every race carbs are rebuilt after every race and there is no average lifespan for them toyota is in a slightly different situation and my knowledge there is very limited toyota itself hasn't made a carbureted pushrod v in a long time so trd in california started from scratch and designed a new engine that was based on what they felt were the best features of the other manufacturers engines and then added their own tweaks it works well in the craftsman truck series but the cup engine is an even newer design with a slightly different block and heads only bill davis' triad corp and trd in california are building the engines which are all supposed to remain identical as far as hardware is concerned and then sell them to the other teams last i heard however toyota has been told they have one or more unfair advantages and are supposed to have a new engine next year but i haven't confirmed that  Diesel engine Chevrolet Corvair engine Dodge Neon Indianapolis 500 AMC V8 engine NASCAR Four-stroke cycle Toyota Corolla V8 Toyota M engine Chevrolet Small-Block engine E85 Internal ballistics Poppet valve Oldsmobile V8 engine Ford Mustang Camshaft Motor oil Toyota A engine Harley-Davidson Internal combustion engine Dodge Charger Sleeve valve Turbocharger GM LS engine Toyota MR2 Connecting rod Fuel injection Motorcycle Displacement on Demand GM 60-Degree V6 engine Chevrolet Corvair Toyota Camry Wankel engine Automatic transmission Penske Racing Battery electric vehicle Variable valve timing Engine tuning Drag racing Chrysler K engine Pickup truck Toyota Prius Spark plug Volvo 200 series Honda Hydraulic machinery Gnome Monosoupape BMW M5 Cylinder head Nissan Skyline Indy Racing League Hybrid vehicle Toyota Land Cruiser Machine gun Screw Chevrolet Big-Block engine Ford Duratec engine Atari 8-bit family ATI Technologies Stirling engine Continuously variable transmission Tire Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster CPU cache Bill Davis Racing Chevrolet Corvette Auto racing Formula One M60 machine gun Hendrick Motorsports Gas turbine Volkswagen Passat Supercharger Roush Racing GM Family II engine Rail terminology 24 Hours of Le Mans Craftsman Truck Series BMW motorcycles Jet engine Evernham Motorsports Automobile Drill bit Aircraft engine NEXTEL Cup Multi-valve

why nascar do not have head lights the first reasons that come to mind are debris on the track from a little bumping and rubbing glass on the track not good for tires if they were running a night race with headlights then if you get into someone and knock out a head light you are no longer safe and have to park to replace the light that is if you can get one to fit into the bent sheet metal not to mention if a car comes on your rear and blinds you from the rear view mirrore hope this helps  Headlight NASCAR Tire Saab 900 Formula One Porsche 993 Indianapolis 500 Bicycle lighting Dodge Charger View camera Auto racing Incandescent light bulb Drag racing BMW M5 Safety car Ford Galaxie Imperial (automobile) Sunglasses Bicycle frame Car handling Toyota Camry Motorcycle Ford Cortina Mirror Nissan Skyline Formula One regulations Ford Mustang Disc brake Honda Prelude Top Fuel 2000 Australian Grand Prix Craftsman Truck Series Saab 99 Darlington Raceway Buick Regal Chevrolet Camaro Tony Stewart Acura Integra (North America) Lake Speed Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Days of Thunder Hearse Lighting Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Bristol Motor Speedway School bus Dodge Daytona Aluminium Sextant Stage lighting Atlanta Motor Speedway Car safety M16 (rifle) Professional wrestling throws Penske Racing Radio controlled car Talladega Superspeedway Rapid transit Spark plug Rail terminology Dodge Neon Kingda Ka De Lorean DMC-12 Indianapolis Motor Speedway Plymouth Superbird Chrysler 300 letter series Downforce Kart racing Sterling Marlin Mitsubishi Starion Mercury Cougar Happy Tree Friends Paul Is Dead Automotive lighting Stock car racing Wayne Corporation Watkins Glen International Motocross Terminal ballistics Glass Glasses Bicycle brake systems Toyota Land Cruiser 24 Hours of Le Mans Spoiler (automotive) Light rail Suzuka Circuit Combine (Half-Life 2) Mitsubishi 3000GT Internal ballistics Motorcycle helmet Lowe's Motor Speedway Airport Pickup truck Sport utility vehicle Escape from New York Eagle Talon Equine conformation

what is the type of qualifying they are doing at watkins glen with the busch cars and why did they change from doing one car at a time when did nascar become lemans style racing road course's suck what has happen to good ole oval track racing this is what they refer to as lemans style qualifying they send x number of cars out on the track at one time spaced seconds apart for laps then take the average times for their best laps it seems to get the session over more quickly and allows the drivers to acclimate to the track this way one bad lap doesn't ruin their effort they used to send cars out at a time spaced half a lap apart running laps each the problem with that system was that qualifying took longer than the actual race they've been doing it this way at wgi since  NASCAR Tony Stewart Indianapolis Motor Speedway Indianapolis 500 Ernie Irvan Penske Racing NEXTEL Cup 2005-06 A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Great Britain Watkins Glen International 2000 Australian Grand Prix Richard Childress Racing 24 Hours of Le Mans Formula One racing Formula One Talladega Superspeedway Dale Earnhardt, Jr. California Speedway Roush Racing Robby Gordon Hendrick Motorsports Craftsman Truck Series Lake Speed Ayrton Senna Auto racing Jacky Ickx 2005 United States Grand Prix Chris Amon Daytona International Speedway 2003 United States Grand Prix Chip Ganassi Racing Scott Dixon New Hampshire International Speedway Lowe's Motor Speedway 2005 European Grand Prix 2005 Canadian Grand Prix Busch Series Dale Earnhardt, Inc.

why dont someone build a figure track with a ramp over the intersection equally banked turns at each end it seems like the more recent ovals are basically the same just think of the passsing while they were crossing from inside left turn to inside right and the seating possibilities are incredible look at the tracks like kentucky speedway they cant get a nascar event for what ever reasons and thats the heart of nascar land the track is beautiful and the most comfortable ive been to i think it would be a cool idea it wouldn't be any different than navagating a road course there would only be turns and the first straightaway would be the ramp which would have to be lower than a normal ramp and the other straightaway would have to be a little below ground level make it miles long so there'd be plenty of passing on the stretches kinda like the old hotwheels tracks but i don't know where they would pit that would be interesting enough  Bristol Motor Speedway NASCAR Pocono Raceway Stock car racing Interchange (road) Darlington Raceway Indy Racing League West Side Highway Interstate Highway Craftsman Truck Series California Speedway Watkins Glen International U.S. Highway 91 Atlanta Motor Speedway Skateboarding trick Nashville Superspeedway Lane Paris Martinsville Speedway Dover International Speedway California State Route 85 Belmont Park Dale Earnhardt Darrell Waltrip Drag racing Las Vegas Motor Speedway Auto racing New Hampshire International Speedway Pulaski Skyway TGV Long Path Long Island Rail Road Dog agility Texas Motor Speedway Beverly Hills, California Sport utility vehicle Interstate 95 U.S. Highway 1 Dirt track racing Highway English cricket team Daytona International Speedway Dodge Charger Twin Ring Motegi Traffic light Freeway Riverside International Raceway Interstate 70 Great Pyramid of Giza Safety car Athletics Toronto Subway and RT Indianapolis, Indiana Talladega Superspeedway London Underground Charlotte, North Carolina Richard Petty Electrophysiology Fuji Speedway 2005 United States Grand Prix Wacker Drive Interstate 94 U.S. Highway 220 Infineon Raceway Drifting (motorsport) Interstate 24 Polo Grounds Bike lane debate Champ Car Interstate 64 Carl Edwards BMT Brighton Line Jughandle BMT Canarsie Line Transportation of Los Angeles Strap-on dildo NASCAR Realignment Car handling The Emancipation of Mimi Suzuka Circuit Ontario Motor Speedway Airport Bobby Hamilton Richard Childress Racing Racing flags Nuclear power Sydney Harbour Bridge California State Route 330 Michigan left Stonehenge Wrigley Field Zola Budd Level crossing

do you think juan pablo montoya needs to give up nascar every race that juan is in he seems to spin out other drivers in my opinion he is unsafe to the other drivers in nascar every weekend i sit and watch and wait for juan to spin out someone cause an accident or wreck himself i personally feel that his he needs to park it for nascar and perhaps go back to doing what ever he used to do what do you think i think jpm needs to spend a few years in the busch series learning how to race a stock car and learning patience he could be a good driver in nextel if he learned patience and took the time to learn how not to wreck people and control his car better i don't dispure that he has done very well in other motorsports but he lacks a lot of qualities for nascar at this time  NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Juan Pablo Montoya Auto racing Busch Series Hendrick Motorsports Indianapolis 500 Stock car racing Watkins Glen International Kyle Busch Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Richard Childress Racing Talladega Superspeedway Tony Stewart Kevin Harvick Evernham Motorsports Carl Edwards Penske Racing Lowe's Motor Speedway Dale Earnhardt, Inc.

who do you think willl win the champions league arsenal liverpool barcelona who sorry wrong section im new sorry ill delete the q sorry again that's a tough question i believe that there are about ten teams capable of winning the uefa champions league manchester united haven't won the european cup for quite a while now years and i believe that they are due a win they are a great team one of the best in the world but their european record is pretty poor inter milan are one of those under rated teams they were great in the serie a least season despite the competiton being poor and they said that they will have a good crack at it this year barcelona had a bad campain last year where they bowed out to liverpool in the second reound and they will be dertimend to make that up ac milan and real madrid are both great teams with fantastic european records real madrid change their maanger far too often and i dont belive that they are the team that they once were however i wouldn't rule them out no team has succssefully defended the european ciup before but ac milan have a chance arsenal have a slim chance of winning the title so i believe that they will be dertimend to win the champions league the same goes for the chelsea in order to be considered as one of the best teams in the world and to get more fans they need to win the champions league and boss jose will be under extreme pressure to do so liverpool are a cup team but i doubt that they will be able to reach the final three times in four years but i wouldnt rule them out  Alex Ferguson Newcastle United F.C. 2004-05 in English football Futebol Clube do Porto Everton F.C.
