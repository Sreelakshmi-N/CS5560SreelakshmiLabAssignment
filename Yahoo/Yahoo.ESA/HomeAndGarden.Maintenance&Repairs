rain gutter pictures any problems you see just wanted you to see these gutter pics i took to get an idea how things go first picture http hidebehind com ce ae second picture http hidebehind com e questions what is that metal thing at arrow is that a drip edge and if so then when you follow the drip edge does it look properly installed or does it seem to not be outhanging enough over the gutter what is that thing at arrow it seems to be some kind of make shift drip edge but if that is the case then back to arrow what is that if it isn't a drip edge notice at arrow the gutter seems to buckle is that acceptable or does that mean it is installed incorrectly and what are the consequences of that buckling you see there what problems that weren't discussed if any above do you see in these picture if any in picture the metal thingy that overhangs into gutter can that cause problems what kind of problems arrow is drip edge all right it's install poorly but it's there the shingles should hang over the dripedge to inch though arrow looks like something that was stuck in there to help the water make it to the gutter to stop a leak that was dripping behind the gutter arrow shows that the installer bent the gutter upwards as he she was installing it and that caused a stresspoint and made the back of the gutter buckle out this will let rain get behind the gutter and drip down it will also let water get on the facia and cause it to rot if the shingles were installed properly that wouldn't be a problem now on to the shingles they have served their time and need to be replaced they do have a time period in which they will do their job up here that's to years depending on the quality of the shingle you can see all the clay in the gutters that's coming from the shingles that are coming apart i don't know if it's just the picture but it appears there's a huge bow in the gutter section in picture that means that either the wall or the facia is in bad shape and is bulged out that's not a good thing i hope it's just the picture making it look like that i's say you need new shingles and fix up the roof deck as required make sure the new ones hang over the drip edge at least inch as this also help with the water drainage when water gets to the edge of anything it tries to climb back up the wat it looks now it can climb right up back onto the roof deck i m betting there will be some rot there or at the least some swelling that will need fixing replacing when the shigles hang out farther the water climbs back and when it hits the dripedge it then runs down not going back under the shigles and onto the roofdeck the metal strip that hanging over the gutter i'm thinking is there to get the watter into the gutter instad of running down the facia and dripping onto your head if you take it out i would almost bet you'd have a leak it won't hurt anything having it in there i would say it's helping right now  Irrigation Roof Drill bit Glossary of climbing terms Poker jargon Intravenous therapy Knife 2000 Australian Grand Prix Violin Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Seismic retrofit Home repair Rigging Tire Archery Blackjack Cricket Theory of conduct Equine conformation Baldrick 1957 World Series Floppy disk Double bass Planetary orbit Spark plug Solar power Debugging Tile Craps Determinism Geodesic dome Nine Inch Nails Skateboarding trick Microeconomics Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The nature of God in Western theology Heinkel He 112 Boat building Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Katana Epistemology Climbing equipment Furnace Pump It Up Weapon Laserdisc Paragliding Escape from New York English longbow Mattress Backstroke Supply and demand Teen Girl Squad Entropy 24 Hours of Le Mans Vinyl roof Paradox Hard disk Scientology beliefs and practices Causality Gambling Plame affair Action potential Bong Terminal ballistics Ontological argument Volleyball Extreme Programming Zeno's paradoxes Shaggy dog story Floyd Rose Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Non-native pronunciations of English Draw poker Carnivorous plant Traffic light Hamster Tank Gramophone record Messerschmitt Bf 109 Casting Textile manufacturing Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Atari 8-bit family Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Billboard (advertising) P-47 Thunderbolt Blood Simple Characters of Lost Nuclear power Diving USS Tunny (SS-282)

how long should a swimming pool last april i had a jacuzzi swimming pool installed in my backyard not only were the crew who set everything up unprofessional they installed a valve upside and had to come back twice to fix the same problem after the first year of having the pool i noticed that the stainless steel plate that the eyeball of the skimmer is connected to was rusting and my pool liner was becoming very loose and wrinkly decided to call the great escape and see if they could have someone come out to fix the problem they said that there was nothing they could do because they had fired the contractors that installed my pool let's fast fwd a few years to the present i go outside to check the chemicals in the water and i step in a huge mud puddle i look down to see the outter part of my pool the part that looks like wood grain bubbling and water squirting out wtf can this be from my first pool lasted over years and this one is falling apart after what can i do i assume this is an above ground pool first and foremost stainless steel does not rust so it was probably chrome second i dunno who the great esacpe is but i assume that they are some sort of pool place and when you buy a pool from them they in turn hire subcontractors to install the pool they are responsible for the people they hire so who cares if they fired them it is still their responsibility they chose to hire the bums not you your contract is with tge not with the bums tge is responsible so what can you do first call tge back and tell them it is their responsibility just like i outlined if they decline tell them you will first contact the bbb better business burea then the local media atleast one channel usually has a crew that pounces on people who do crappy work then contact jacuzzi and tell them of tge's unscrupulous behaviour in selling servicing warrantying jaccuzzi's product and last but not least you will contact a lawyer which you know without a doubt it is a courtcase that you will win and in turn tge will provide you a new pool at their expense plus pay all attourney fees if they still buck up and say screw you do what i just told you to do and show some fangs oh and by the way you should have your swimming pool papers somewhere if u didn't throw them away which will tell you the brand model and warranty info pools all vary in warranties i don't know of any with less than a yr manufacturers warranty this does not cover labor warranty tho  Swimming pool Welding Knife Drill bit Tire Mattress Bretton Woods system Sauna Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Solar power Carburetor Corrosion Steel Gas metal arc welding Brewery Passenger car Tag Motorcycle The Apprentice 2 Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina ITV Microeconomics Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Poker jargon Copyleft Universal Serial Bus Apple Computer Grey market M16 (rifle) Dairy Fire hydrant Thermal power station E85 Body piercing Cookware and bakeware 1919 World Series United Kingdom corporation tax Digital photography Wayne Corporation Insurance Dodge Neon Keynesian economics RMS Titanic Futurama (TV series - season 5) Road-rule enforcement camera The Amazing Race TSMS Lakonia Apollo 8 Efficiency wages Diving cylinder Topps Jackass: The Movie Wal-Mart Elevator Cranford, New Jersey Krag-J__rgensen Modding Hydrochloric acid Land Rover Heinkel He 112 Charles Ponzi Action potential Siphon Publicly funded medicine Hydraulic machinery MDAC Trademark Information Services Procurement Library IPod Titanium M60 machine gun Stage lighting Sento Pioneer Zephyr Dishwasher Plastic Hydrogen economy Make money fast Viva La Bam IBook Public policy Douglas DC-8 Mercury 4 Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Economy of the United States Diving Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Handloading

septic tank leach line how to tell which part has the pipes i need to install a fence and my septic lines reach almost to the back of the woods where i want to install my fence how do i avoid hitting the trench part of the leach line where the pipes are is it where the grass is green or is it the part that has kind of sunk down and doesn t have any color due to the drought in the area ok let me start with i have worked for a plumbing company for over yrs i have ran two of them and still run another one for my best friend with that said your septic tank should be buried no more then inches below your yard your header coming off of the tank is about inches below the top of the tank now if your tank is less than inches below the ground than your header to your field lines will be closer to the top of the ground your header should be a in or in schedule or depends on how old the tank is and if it is home made the difference is the thickness of the pipe is thin is thicker the header comes out so far and then it drains into pipes depends on what was put in or what your county health dept allowed those pipes could be as small as inches and as large as inches it could have gravel under it and black pipe with holes facing down called sock pipe if it is the inch pipe than your field lines could be alot closer than you think so if the top of the tank is say inches under the dirt and your header is inches that makes inches total but if you have a inch sock pipe then your field lines are inches below the dirt if the ground is sunken in that could be your tank or field lines i would be very careful in your going to put a fence there you may want to have a plumber come out and find the end of your field lines if down the road you have problems you can not take them out and put them back where they were you have to move them so with that said you don't want to mess them up by putting the fence on top of them causing them not to work cause you crushed them on the end or close to it and it can cost any where between to grand depends on what your laws are there regarding and how many feet etc the laws here change every year or two hope this helps  Septic tank Autonomous building Domestic water system Thermal power station Drill bit Laws of cricket Textile manufacturing Baseball Equine conformation Toilet paper Barbed wire Tank M16 (rifle) Tag Drainage Marching band Snooker Kitchen Bong Airport Boston Red Sox Seismic retrofit Brewery Billiards Mattress Wood Baseball field Glossary of American football Ethernet Siphon Objective-C Dairy Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Drag racing Battle of Tarawa Dog agility 1957 World Series Mark VIII (tank) 2004 American League Championship Series Fast bowling Stairway Shaggy dog story Home run Japanese toilet Apollo Command/Service Module Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Hastings United FC Transformer Combine (Half-Life 2) Lechaina Second Battle of El Alamein Electrical wiring Cleveland Browns Glennallen, Alaska Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Hamster View camera Basement Archery Diamond Nine Inch Nails Caliche Tobacco Glossary of firefighting equipment Indianapolis 500 Home repair A151 road Motorcycle The Manchester Regiment 2004 World Series Israeli West Bank barrier Dodge Charger Hard disk T-34 Shotgun Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Battle of the Somme (1916) Hydraulic machinery Comparison of Canadian and American football Fancy rat Violin Table tennis Trench warfare Wario Lawn mower Turbocharger Derbyshire lead mining history Rail terminology 2000 Australian Grand Prix

how can i unblock my kitchen sink this isn't a straightforward block the waste water from the sink flows into the washing machine next to it i set the washing machine to 'drain' and it sends the water back to the sink i have put down one bottle of sink unblocker which has reduced the water level i have poured a second bottle of sink unblocker down the sink which i shall leave overnight if this doesn't work i am going to get some caustic soda and put that down the sink any other ideas please i want to try and avoid getting in a plumber because they are so expensive your sink pipes are blocked with soap powder and grit which is in soap powder you can use all the chemicals you want but they will not move this type of blockage if you can remove the trap under the sink or take out a peice of pipe to get into a streight run of pipe and get a drain spring from b and q or a plumbing store and push down the spring and rotate it it will break up the deposits and they will flush through with water j r s environmental services  Sewage treatment Domestic water system Plumbing fixture Kitchen Bong Siphon Menstrual cup Water purification Sodium hydroxide Sewer Rebreather Japanese toilet Energy development Flush toilet Hard water Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Carbon dioxide Thermal power station Internal ballistics Brewery Autonomous building Water Dialysis Urinal Plastic Textile manufacturing Dishwasher Hydraulic machinery Sulfuric acid Washing machine Drainage Laundry detergent Acne Coffee Drill bit Bread Glossary of firefighting equipment Cruising (maritime) Bulk vending Cocaine Tea Soap Diseases of the honeybee Basement Eggerland series Dishwashing Blitzball Wario Naval mine Soap bubble Dundas Square Compiler optimization Mattress Fire extinguisher Toilet Solar power Tap (valve) Carbon dioxide sink CPU cache Piccolo Junior Saga Futurama (TV series - season 4) Oplan Bojinka Sodium Toilet paper Home repair Fossil fuel power plant Portable stove Equine conformation Carburetor Seismic retrofit Agar plate Drain cleaner Tattoo Ship Hydroponics Dam Casting Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Glass Soldering Cannabis (drug) Hydropower Mach kernel Potassium hydroxide Bottle Derbyshire lead mining history Coriolis effect Single malt Scotch Ocean thermal energy conversion E85 Fountain Sento Dredge Eutrophication Waste management Toilet humour

i put gas in my lawn mower's oil tank and ran it for seconds accidently it isn't running right anymore is there any hope for it drain the oil out by putting gas in the oil it thinned it out which isnt good and can damage berings inside the motor lawnmower engines are typically a 'sling' type meaning they 'sling' oil onto the major bering surfaces unlike vehicles that have oil pumps to put oil under pressure where needed continually running the motor on the tainted oil will cause failure of the motor from no lubrication id use a heavy weight motor oil like sae and an engine oil additive like lucas oil i use it if its making metallic noises well then its a matter of time before it destroys itself rebuilding it isnt an option at that point its better to locate a donor motor kidd  Motor oil Internal combustion engine Gasoline Diesel engine Thermal power station Lawn mower Turbocharger Two-stroke cycle Heinkel He 100 Manual transmission Transmission (mechanics) Automobile Hydraulic machinery Diving cylinder Carburetor Spark plug Terran (StarCraft) Radio controlled airplane Motorcycle Locomotive Steam engine Petroleum Jet engine Siphon Tank M60 machine gun Rocket fuel Fire fighting Mooney M20 Fluid bearing Battery electric vehicle Filling station Space shuttle main engine Glossary of firefighting terms The Lawnmower Man Hydrogen economy Model aircraft Solar power Oil platform Hybrid vehicle Aircraft engine controls Friction Natural gas Pump Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Honda Prelude Radio controlled car Toyota Prius Internal ballistics Hydropneumatic Combine harvester Handloading Continuously variable transmission Sling (weapon) Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 Engine cooling Gas turbine Weapon Glossary of firefighting equipment Oil refinery Saab 900 Tire Wind turbine Fire extinguisher Toyota Camry Spacecraft propulsion Portable stove Displacement on Demand Saturn V Thermostat Energy development Glossary of climbing terms Turbo-Hydramatic Texaco Gas compressor Porsche 911 Scramjet Ford Thunderbird Space Shuttle program Vacuum Alcohol fuel Headlight Engine Drill bit Bicycle frame Bullet USS S-36 (SS-141) Knife Auto racing USS S-37 (SS-142) Nuclear power Biodiesel Pebble bed reactor

what is the good better best brands of heating air components and wich to stay away from i've heard of trane carrier heil but wich is best or does it really matter with the brand on a furnace and a c unit i'm getting a lot of quotes that range from up to for a ton a c btu gas furnace my home is right at sq ft and has vents of wich are ran in the attic b c that part of the house is a addition one guy wants to tear out all the attic vents and put in new ones and double them from to some are hybrid heat pump and they are more expensive but not by more than over the standard but i havn't had to shop for this type of item before and i don't know much about it and of course every sales guy that comes out with a different brand claims their's is the best trane is one of the best manufacturers i would stay away from carrier be careful of names you have not heard before because chances are carrier owns them i could go into great detail about why you should not choose carrier but it would take a lot of time i do not have a manual j in front of me and do not know the volume of your home but from experience tons for sf might be to much air units are like cars continual start and stop will hurt the unit more than a good steady run units installed larger than required start and stop frequently because it does not take them long to cool or heat the problem with that is the unit does not run long enough to equalize the humidity in the air as for costs of unit there are many options new law enacted by the help of global warming gore has raised the seers level of all hvac units the minimum level of seers rating is seers as opposed to seers the problem with this is that the copper tubing for the lower rating seers will not work with all higher seers units this requires more time and material for insulation the good thing about the higher seers ratings is that they are more energy efficient variable speeds are the most expensive and the most efficient unless you plan on living there for more than years you may not make back in energy savings that you spent for the unit i do believe that in the next years people are going to look past the cost of a home and look into the cost to operate a home  Solar power Air conditioning Hydrogen economy Furnace Carburetor Nuclear power Solar cell Hybrid vehicle Transformer M16 (rifle) Welding Wind turbine Thermal power station Alcohol fuel HVAC Turbocharger Fossil fuel power plant Diesel engine Spark plug Casting Toyota Prius Wind power Brewery Nuclear reactor Steam engine Internal ballistics Motor oil Explosive material Ocean thermal energy conversion Renewable energy Carbon dioxide Gas metal arc welding Battery electric vehicle Automobile Fuel injection Internal combustion engine Circuit breaker Supercharger Pebble bed reactor Microeconomics Rocket fuel Solar power satellite Gramophone record Insurance Airbus A380 Loudspeaker Steel Energy development Electric arc furnace Diode Inflation Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Gas turbine Daylight saving time Inventory Vacuum Mitigation of global warming Lighting Gasoline Hydraulic machinery Transistor Motorcycle TGV Optical fiber Tire Diving suit CPU design Fire fighting Personal rapid transit United States Postal Service Nuclear weapon design Hydrogen vehicle Circuit design Swamp cooler STS-62 Water (molecule) Bicycle lighting United Kingdom corporation tax Capitalism Powder metallurgy Ceramics Battery (electricity) Electrical wiring Turbofan Central processing unit Bicycle frame Biodiesel

how do you motivate yourself at the minute i carnt seem to motivate myself to do anything theres so much needs doing in my home from decorating cleaning clearing stuff out cleaning gardening etc i just dont know where to start help yes i agree with mark r lower your horizons only think of the one job you're actually doing now if you clutter your mind with grand plans and lists of all the things you'll have to do it will sap all your energy and depress you stress is the difference between what you perceive you have to do and what you think you can do if you think of all the work that needs doing you will not be able to imagine how you can do it all that causes stress followed by depression if you think about and do only one small thing at a time then you gain satisfaction as each one is completed you need those satisfaction bonuses to keep going if you think of doing everything then you will only get satisfaction at the end and you will starve yourself of satisfaction until then you cannot survive that way you must positively avoid thinking and talking about all the other things which you have to do like athletes when they clear their mind of everything else in preparation for the attempt at the high jump  (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction Motivation Happiness Social psychology Merit Summa Theologiae Microeconomics Anorexia nervosa Radar Altruism Francis Crick Murder Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Sadism and masochism Capitalism Pole vault In Cold Blood W.

white leather sofa i took delivery of a white leather sofa today a two seater and a three seater the two seater is fine but when you sit on the white sofa and get up all of the leather is wrinkled and you have to smooth it with your hand even then its a bit dented the two seater just springs back up the lady at customer services says it just needs plumping but surely i dont have to do this every time i get up what do you think the problem is and how do i get it sorted thanks i dont have any kids im worried that the leather will crack leather does not come in a uniform way like fabric does it comes from hides which are all different and the panels are all cut from different areas you may have a sofa that has had the panel cut from the belly area where the leather is more 'stretchy' than on other areas the leather should be fine and will only crack if it is not looked after in the correct way however if you are not happy with the item and it does seem that there is a marked difference between the two then ask for it to be replaced if you want to know what your rights are and you are in the uk ring the association of master upholsterers whoc will advise you as you have a white suite it is imperative that you look after it otherwise you will regret the decision pale leathers can suffer from dye transfer from clothing and the use of a quality leather protector ltt is the most effective on the market wil help to resist this and make cleaning easier if you do this while it is new you will be helping a great deal to clean either use lazy leather in cleaner and protector or leather shampoo and your white leather should stay looking white good luck with the other issue  Upholstery Leather Clothing Mattress Chair Knife Textile manufacturing terminology Strap-on dildo Plastic Textile manufacturing Violin Theory of conduct Wood Undergarment Dry cleaning Pottery Fencing Welding Kimono De Lorean DMC-12 Drill bit Casting Timpani Diamond Breastfeeding Woodworking Brewery Sento Camouflage Softball Enterprise content management Economy of the United States Knitting Gucci Gramophone record Hakama Combine (Half-Life 2) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Vulcanization Hemp Bulk vending Warez CPU cache Jute The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters Climbing equipment Trade union Psoriasis Comanche Couch Hubble Space Telescope Motorcycle Darth Vader Table tennis Chicago White Sox Bong Glass Status of Forces Agreement Sonic the Hedgehog Coin collecting Inflation Sin City Functional programming Shark Chevrolet Camaro Airsoft Utilitarianism Dog training Poker jargon Volleyball Air New Zealand BMW M5 Flag of Hong Kong Heavy metal fashion Externality Social rule Suplex Kilt Items in the Metroid series Information Services Procurement Library Copy protection Paragliding Snooker Lighting Quicksort Hamster Equine conformation Goaltender Geodesic dome Sewing machine Rigging Illegal drug trade Carburetor Service Compact disc High-heeled shoe Niddah Henri Murger

what is the best process for painting aluminum siding house has worn and chalky aluminum siding over years old aluminum siding presents some unique problems but these can be dealt with by using the proper products and procedures first problem is the chalking this needs to come off avoid using bleach absolutely no ammonia on aluminum tri sodium phosphate cup per gallon start at the top scrub a bit and rinse well you always need to clean before painting it is especially important here the second problem is with the paint itself you will want a good acrylic latex with a low sheen flat satin or eggshell finish many latex paints contain ammonia as a stabilizer ammonia does not like aluminum if there are any bare spots or even just very thin original paint the new paint will bubble and wrinkle up and fall off also the surface is very hard it is difficult for any paint to adhere well you need a special primer to overcome this there are several brands it will be labeled as a primer for aluminum sometimes galvanized surfaces as well you will probably need to find a paint store or at least a good paint department to get it very thin and runny smells bad but it does work very well read the directions you must put the topcoat on while the primer is still a bit damp you will not be able to prime the whole house and then paint you will have to prime a bit and then paint that part do not use a pressure washer for this one it can dent the siding if you are not careful at the very least you will end up with water behind the siding the pressure will force water into the seams this can run out later on your wet paint not good also will not take care of the problem you need to scrub just a bit to loosen the chalking surface  Mattress Aluminium Menstrual cup Paint Welding Ammonia Casting Internal ballistics Brush Cookware and bakeware Plastic Drill bit Handloading Hydrogen economy Turquoise Brewery Diving suit Gas metal arc welding Wok Textile manufacturing Fire extinguisher Hydrogen peroxide Dishwasher Sodium hypochlorite Car handling Diving Japanese tea ceremony Brazing Soap Amateur telescope making Gas tungsten arc welding Motorcycle Bong Water purification Gesso Town gas Primer (paint) Soil pH Titanium Printmaking Strap-on dildo Hard disk Bicycle brake systems Fire fighting Irrigation Tooth Explosive material Soap bubble Loudspeaker Sewage treatment Hemp E number Equine conformation Thermal power station Horseshoe Laundry detergent Dialysis Terminal ballistics Coal 2000 Australian Grand Prix Friction Sodium carbonate Industrial wastewater treatment Seismic retrofit Fluoride therapy Water (molecule) First aid Tag Cartridge (firearms) Polymerase chain reaction Drawing Lionel Corporation Cheese Kosher foods Space Shuttle external tank Radio controlled airplane Social rule Screw Dairy Acrylic paint Hard water Sento CPU cache Mercury (element) Printed circuit board Hydrochloric acid Ammonium nitrate Origin of life Sodium

how do i tell if a motor's start winding has failed our dryer stopped working the other day when i press the start button it starts running but as soon as i let go of the button it stops again i've done a bunch of investigating and the usual causes for this don't seem to be the problem one expert told me that the start winding on the motor has probably failed and the motor needs replacing before i spend the to buy a new motor though i'd like to be sure that that's the problem is there some way to test a dryer motor's start winding to see if it's failed i have the dryer almost completely disassembled so i can access the motor easily thanks for any help you can give me my wife is about to kill me for not just hiring a repairman or buying a new dryer test the motor for continuity across the leads since you have to pull the motor anyway just go ahead and replace it  Toyota Prius Electric motor Knots Landing Indianapolis 500 Chris Amon Mouse (computing) TGV 2005 United States Grand Prix Elevator 2003 United States Grand Prix Carburetor The Amazing Race Cadillac Traffic light Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Outsourcing 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines 2005 Bahrain Grand Prix Irrigation 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Inspector Gadget Iditarod 2004 San Marino Grand Prix The Midnight Sun 2005 Canadian Grand Prix 24 Hours of Le Mans Movie projector NeXT Pedestrian crossing Extreme Programming British American Racing Fault tolerant design Jordan Grand Prix Pioneer Zephyr Poker jargon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cheating in Counter-Strike Toronto Subway and RT Thermal power station Armoured warfare USS S-38 (SS-143) Motor oil Spidey Super Stories Cruising (maritime) New World First Bus Airsoft Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina R46 (New York City Subway car) USS Tunny (SS-282) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina 2005 French Grand Prix 2005 Hungarian Grand Prix John F.

central heat vs portable heater here is the question during the winter my electric bill jumps from to dollars my electric central heater is very old made in like the 's and my thermostat doesn't even come close to working correctly if i could get new ones i would but i rent so i can't change them because it is so hard to keep the heat at a constant temp and the high cost of heating i was thinking of getting like two portable heaters one for the living room and one for the bedroom would that use less electricity than the old half broke central heat thanks sasha but i don't have fans in the house but portable fans might work right well the landlords covered two of the vents with tile and one with carpet so the bathroom has no heat and my son's bedroom has no heat i was thinking of cuting them so heat went through cause the tile and carpet get really hot do you think that would help oh and as for the outlets that is a good question because my roof has holes and water bleeds through the walls and an entire wall in my bedroom the outlets went out because of the water i don't think i should use portable heaters then but i'm afraid to use central heat because of the heat on the covered vents the floor and tile get really really hot the landlords have known about this for over a year we are just trying to get through it till febuary when we can move but i have a young child and i don't want him to be cold this winter yes the portable circulation fans will help if you don't have ceiling fans the portable space heaters would probably use the same or slightly less electricity than the main air handler electric heat if you decide to go that route make sure you do your research and get a good ul rated heater even one with the tip over protection these portable space heaters are often what cause fires in winter if the drapes touch the coils for example make sure you follow the manufacturers recommendations for clearances around the units i've used a portable heater for supplemental heat before but i could never get it adjusted right to give me a good constant temperature you would probably have to find an expensive one with a remote thermostat to make it maintain comfortable temps so what's my recommendation if it were me i would talk to the landlord and try to get him to do something about the broken down unit or just live with it it may be as simple as a bad thermostat and cost like bucks to replace it i don't think the portable heaters are worth the safety risk and you still won't have real comfortable even temps what do i do in my cold room in my house i bought a watt halogen lamp that i turn on when its cold i get the light and heat radiating from the lamp and it does as good a job as anything while i am in the room  Solar power Furnace Thermal power station Autonomous building Kitchen Carburetor Heat Fan (implement) Basement Lighting Welding Transformer Wind power Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Temperature Solar panel Bathroom Asbestos Spark plug Apollo 13 Sento Seismic retrofit Fire fighting Passive solar Electrical wiring Cruising (maritime) Glossary of firefighting terms Refrigerator Glossary of firefighting equipment Solar cell Slow cooker Process control Fluorescent lamp Drill bit Central heating Diesel engine Headlight Renewable energy Pebble bed reactor Vacuum tube Hard disk E85 Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Bicycle lighting Energy Fossil fuel power plant Oscilloscope Tire Burglar alarm Stove Radiator Light-emitting diode Tesla coil Poker jargon Hydrogen economy Rail terminology Alcohol fuel Loudspeaker Dundas Square Portable stove Haloalkane Soldering iron Passenger car Vacuum cleaner Upholstery Steam engine Ocean thermal energy conversion Nuclear power Chevrolet Corvair Energy development Jet engine Wood fuel Water heater Ra (board game) The Brady Bunch Sauna Hot air balloon Electric motor Diode Volleyball Diving suit Equine conformation Tank Thermoregulation Ironing Mattress Bi-metal Plasma (physics) Thermocouple Surveillance Internal combustion engine Diving Battery (electricity)

racing lawnmower im but know a great deal about mowers so dont think im just some stupid kid im building a racing lawnmower out of a murray mower frame im scrapping the tecumsea on board and i have a hp b s i c with the govenor removed i used the one piece flo jet carb on it instead of the factory lmt so i could have a bigger barral with and have a cold air intake system i reversed the stacker pully and will put a inch pully on the tranny i welded a bracked i cut off of a gocart for throttle lever mounting and strait piped the engine with metal pipe im working on rewiring it so i wont have any traces of an interlock system i could use any ideas pics diagrams or any other mods thanks im currently tinkering on a o's murray lawntractor its using for the moment a hp briggs ohv motor stock stock speed transaxle for the meantime golf kart wheels rims tapered bering hubs on front wheels the trick is less drag then its faster the stock front wheels w o berings will slow you waaay down plus be a weak spot at least look for some with the internal berings currently im using the basic drive belt setup stock clutch setup with extra tensioner pulleys for no slippage a cast pulley on the motor a pulley on the transaxle it gets me near mph in this setup obviously the deck is gone was all rotten when i bot it i dont suggest leaving the deck on specially not in running form remove the blades spindle assys being a bare shell would be okay tho most racers cut them up and just bolt the sides of the deck to the floorbord for the look of a deck and less weight next step is a hp flathead twin cylender briggs i got off a mtd im hooking a 'snap back throttle 'setup on it using a high flow air filter element bypassing stock air cleaner assy possibly a slightly larger engine pulley meybe a smaller trans pulley right now my limitations are in the trans for speed options once it lets go ill swap a degree right angle drive unit in run a chain setup to a straight axle rear end and have to use a go kart clutch or torque drive setup since no tranny will be there this isnt setup to race this is for personal experementation i do have to add a few saftey issues here tho brakes use a set of good aftermarket go kart brakes stock brakes wont work at those speeds trust me things come at you mighty fast with no brakes id suggest not bypassing the governer unless its been highly machined to acept the extra rpms theyre only designed for max rpms theres a chance the flywheel could shatter not to mention how fast parts would fly from the motor overevving it you can get alot of speed with a goverener on it mines still on it and it runs mph wear a helmit and saftey gear i wear a helmit when i drive my tractor you only come with one brain and it scrambles easy have some welding done id suggest strengthing alot of the parts on the tractor steering front spindles chassis you can buy or make a set of front spindles that are stronger then stockers and they accept a go kart type hub for those wheels a differnt type of steering should be used as well the go kart type is stronger and better then stock you dont want to be flying around and have it break on you build the tractor low the lower the better when its too far off the ground its top heavy making it easier to tip over on you the lower wider the more stability i have to add this one as well common sense dont drive on the streets or roads if you have alot of property then use it there you dont want to be pulled over by the police on a lawntractor its not a leagal motor vehicle for the streets or worse get run over by a car if you really want to race them with others join a lawntractor racing group in your area yes they have them theres specific guidelines to setup your tractor but its for saftey purposes use google for one in your area id also suggest one more thing a saftey kill switch id suggest the one that hooks to your arm like new snowmobiles jet skis and a seat switch that way if y slip and fall off the tractor wont keep running you mentioned a straight pipe motors need a certain amount of backpressure to run right i have a straight pipe on mine for now i plan on using some threaded black pipe and fittings to run it down n under the floorbord a way to tell how long to make it at first make it a bit long spray some white paint on the pipe and run the motor for a bit where the paint turns brown is where to cut it with the twin cylender and twin pipes it should look sweet i plan on looking for some chrome drain pipe for bathroom sinks ect to cover the black pipe this tractor is actually my second the first was a older craftsman with a hp ohv briggs till the speed trans locked up then i made the murray the next one will be a screemer out of a old wheelhorse raider lowered near full blown racing setup and using a hp tecumseh motor with oil pressure oil pressured motors are better for racing setups plan on using go kart wheels spindles steering full chain drive straight rear axle and the right angle gear drive its a unit used on bush hogs field mowers kidd  Hydraulic machinery Thermal power station Two-stroke cycle Model aircraft E85 Automatic transmission Toyota Corolla

ac blows out cool air instead of cold air help believe it or not the less freon you have the colder the air is that is why if you are low on freon your coil freezes if it is blowing cool instead of cold i would say there is a good chance you are over charged on freon if you've had someone work on your unit recently i'd call them because they put in too much freon  Air conditioning Haloalkane Refrigerator Phase change heat pump Thermostat Water (molecule) Cryogenics Cloud Climate of the United Kingdom Fog Severe weather terminology (United States) Frost Ice Engine cooling Solar power Refrigeration Weather front Peltier-Seebeck effect Deep lake water cooling Wind Precipitation (meteorology) Lake effect snow Vacuum Temperature Soldering Weather lore Tesla coil Carbon dioxide Little Ice Age Diving regulator Stirling engine Ozone depletion Autonomous building Thermal power station Fan (implement) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Liquid breathing Transformer Ocean thermal energy conversion HVAC Ozone hole Convection Thermoregulation Polyethylene terephthalate Thunderstorm Atmospheric circulation Prevailing winds Katabatic wind Ice cream Eocene Wind power Heat exchanger Ford Ranger EV Toa Water vapor Hydropower Sea ice Turbocharger Monsoon Supercritical drying Explosive material Tank Diesel engine Mattress Directed-energy weapon Water Watercooling Space Shuttle external tank K__ppen climate classification Temperate Fossil fuel power plant Planetary habitability Atlanta metropolitan area Cray-1 Vacuum tube 1998 Ice Storm Soap bubble Fluorine Swimming pool Poker jargon Glass CPU cooling Liquefied natural gas Spark plug Ice age Welding Carbon tetrachloride Ammonia CDC 7600 Cyclone Bleed air Anticyclone Desert Cryonics Relative humidity Food preservation Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Oral sex Swamp cooler Adiabatic process

i noticed some rot on a floor joist do i need to replace it or just cut out the rot the joist is in the upstairs bathroom downstairs kitchen ceiling the source of the leak has been fixed i already have the ceiling ripped out and have to cut out some of the sub floor in the bathroom how can i fix this to prevent further rot and provide a solid foundation for me to install a tile floor in the upstairs bathroom and a ceiling in the downstairs kitchen i have heard of a term called sister joist what is this and do i need to create one to fix my problem or is there a better solution i don't want to do the job half fast i want to make a permanent fix that will last forever so i don't have to worry about it thanks for your input the joist is about long the wood rot goes up about the rotted area is about across on the bottom of the joist so there is about of good wood it appears to be just on the surface will the spray on treatment work for this if i cut out the section an put a x inch piece of wood on the joist secured with carriage bolts would that work or is this considered jerry rigging it a hardware store will sell you wood treatment it sprays on and treats wood rot white rot brown rot fungus termites bugs you name it spray or brush it on let it dry and then add a second coat a joist is any wood steel or concrete beams set parallel from wall to wall or across or abutting girders to support a floor or ceiling a sister joist simply means attaching more material to the side of the joist this can mean that a new joist of the same size and length is screwed or nailed firmly to the old joist sistering could also involve sandwiching the old joist with new material on both sides if the wood is not out of shape i think a spray on wood treatment is the simplest way to go  Seismic retrofit Stairway Drill bit Basement Screw Wood Rail tracks Straw-bale construction Timber framing Dinghy Boat building Rigging Textile manufacturing Electrical wiring Upholstery Drywall Hamster Knife Table saw Platform framing Mattress Kitchen Deck (ship) Lathe Wallpaper group McMansion Amateur telescope making Debugging Lumber Architecture of the California missions Brush Lighting Wood fuel Vermicompost Concrete Sailing Panama Canal Locks Fecal incontinence Woodworking Window St Albans Cathedral Reinforced concrete Irrigation Roof Floppy disk Bristol Grammar School Xanadu House Elevator Laserdisc Gas metal arc welding Internal ballistics Equine conformation Solar power Tile Dundas Square Bathroom Paint Passenger car Fancy rat Geodesic dome Welding Billiards Brewery Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Campfire Anchor Solar cell Dam Dairy Chatsworth House Software bug Fire extinguisher Manicure Collision detection Glossary of climbing terms Chopsticks White House Plywood Air-raid shelter Oscilloscope Masonry RuneScape quests Dymaxion house Glass

help problems with the air conditioner my central heating and air is having a problem it fires up fine but after a short period of time the fan stops blowing it will not fire back up untill the heating unit it reset or the thermostat is shut off for an extended period of time the ac compressor is running fine and the burner is also running well the filter is clean is there anything that can be done diy heat and cool at the same time if you just trying them both at different times to see if one will work right and your having the same problem with both then it sounds like your blower motor is going out its overheating and staying off on the overload and will not be able to turn back on until it cools down if that happening then you need to change out the motor and capacitor it is fairley simple to change out the motor if your mechanically inclined if not call someone out just remember to turn off the breaker and double check the wiring so that you don't shock yourself or burn the motor out  Thermostat Thermal power station Jet engine Fan (implement) Carburetor Motor oil Electric motor Circuit breaker Turbocharger Air conditioning Furnace Two-stroke cycle Three-phase electric power Refrigerator Mars Exploration Rover Residual-current device Supercharger Switch Explosive material Pebble bed reactor Reading spark plugs for racing Brewery Stirling engine Gas turbine Portable stove Low-pass filter Capacitor Gas compressor Transformer Incandescent light bulb Relay Armored Core Heat Engine cooling Daylight saving time Fuse (electrical) Fluorescent lamp Fire fighting Burning Man Torpedo Central processing unit Vacuum tube Bicycle brake systems Phase change heat pump Welding Hyperthermia Steam engine Tank Electronic amplifier Diode Machine gun Equine conformation Directed-energy weapon Ford Ranger EV Short circuit Turbojet Nuclear meltdown Diesel engine E85 Frank Whittle Spark plug Ceramics First aid Internal combustion engine Burglar alarm Tesla coil Capacitor plague Battery (electricity) Traffic light Glossary of firefighting equipment Hard disk Spacecraft propulsion Professional wrestling throws Oscilloscope Heat exchanger Electrical wiring Internal ballistics Soldering Energy development Hydraulic machinery Commodore 64 Radio controlled car Bong Web crawler M16 (rifle) SR-71 Blackbird Domestic AC power plugs and sockets STS-61 Novelty (locomotive) Drill bit Windscale fire Rail terminology Home repair

if we get a new hvac can it use the freon pipe of the old one our three bedroom house is built on a concrete slab and the pipes go through it that makes it very hard to replace pipes if we replace the hvac central unit and outside unit will they most likely use the old pipe how likely is that to be a good option if we do it that way how much is it likely to cost the cost of the new central unit the new outside unit and the labor the a c is electric and the heat is gas we wouldn't mind converting to all electric because our electricity is cheaper than our gas but if we did that would it have any effect on what pipes are needed the present system is years old and doesn't do a very good job of air conditioning the piping between the condensor compressor and the evapourator are usually designed for the matched set this is a question to ask the companies you get estimates from it may affect the warranty there is no real way to know the condition of the pipes in the slab they may last for another years or fail the day after the new a c unit is installed i do not think any company will guarantee the existing piping is your house insulated well enough for electric heat does your electric service have the capacity if you are located in canada or the united states northern states you will require at least a amp volt electric service do you have an attic if you do does it have an access door if it has an access door the piping and wiring can be routed through the attic here is some things to ponder when hiring contractors selecting contractors do this for each job required hvac and electric service if one contractor will be doing both make sure they have qualified hvac techs and qualified electrician and the qualified trades persons will be the ones doing the work look up local contractors first work out form the closest to your location if some you trust has had work done similar to yours ask them about the contractor they used if they were completely satisfied with their contractor s ask for their telephone number select at least your are interested in giving you an estimate do a google yahoo search on each of the contractors you are interested in look for praises check who is writing the praises to see if they have any connection to the contractor scam artists and coffident persons often work in groups google yahoo search the people giving the praise or references when you are satisfied with at least contractors have the give you written estimates with details of work to be done terms guarantee s cost of extras how much do they charge if they find something not covered by the contract paymant schedules if necessary make sure they are fully licenced and insured and whatever else you can think of to protect yourself if the contractor tries to pressure you into signing the contract immediately with a high deposit more than reject that contractor be careful high pressure can be someone who sounds very convincing but has many reasons why you should sign on the dotted line now it is always good to have another adult with you when a contractor inspects the work to be done if you do not get at least written estimates signed by the contractor not you do not sign yet go back to do this until you have selected at least contractors read over the estimates and have someone check the who has some knowledge of this type of work this may take longer than you thought do not rush into it research resaerch research helps then make your decision when you are more informed good luck  Electrical wiring Air conditioning HVAC Solar power Contract

my lawn mower wont start i bent my blade a few weeks ago and the grass wouldnt shoot into the bag and it would stall out i changed the blade and now it wont even start some white smoke comes out of the exhaust and wont turn over you said you bent the blade was there a screeching sound or one that just died out i straighten crank shafts and that sure sounds like what you may have done i don't know what engine you have when you changed the blade did you turn it over possibly causing oil to get all over the filter not to mention other places oil isn't supposed to go you say it won't even start but then you say some white smoke comes out of the exhaust and won't turn over what i would do is have someone take the lawn mower and tilt the handle back including the deck where you can see underneath it a bit away from the unit then have them pull the cord watch the blade if it doesn't do a smooth revolution it's bent by that the blade will look like it 's wobbling do this a few times to make sure because only someone that is use to it will recognize that i have a crank shaft straightener so look for this all the time when i hear what you are describing other wise you have got oil all over the place or your crankshaft done bit the dirt if it is broke you can't straighten it i charge very little for this other's shops i have heard charge out the wazoo for it if you need to get hold of me can walk you through the process  Lawn mower Motor oil Helicopter Steam engine Internal combustion engine Professional wrestling holds Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Canoe Jet engine Aerial (dance move) Thermal power station Friends Carburetor Mower Lawn Briggs & Stratton Turbocharger Knife Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Tractor Four-stroke cycle Time Out of Mind Radio controlled airplane Supercharger Swingout Katana Sport rowing Hockey stick Snooker Bong Ford FE engine Woodworking Wind turbine Drag racing Table tennis Poker jargon The Legend of Zelda series enemies Shaggy dog story The Marshall Mathers LP USS Trigger (SS-237) Yu-Gi-Oh!

yardman mower starts but quits when throttle is advanced mower worked okay five days ago new gas put in spark plug looks fairly clean filter not very dirty will run at at a low to moderate speed but dies when throttle is moved all the way forward as if it is being chocked down the choke is activated by pushing in on a little rubber bulb which springs back out after each push how would i check the choke for proper action i'm thinking it might be stuck in the choke position can anyone help after some answers i put carburetor cleaner liquid on the carburetor cleaned the area on top of the carburetor wiggled the control wires mashed all along the length of the rubber tube from the gas tank to the carburetor and left the gas cap loose the mower started okay and kept running even when i advanced the throttle then stopped twice while i was mowing but then kept on working until i was able to mow the whole front yard and both side yards thanks everybody i don't know what made it start working but i am very appreciative of all the suggestions the fuel filter may not look dirty but change it only a couple of dollars it may be dirty enough that when more throttle is needed it cant supply the fuel also check clean your air filter that will cause it also  Fuel injection Lawn mower E85 Aircraft engine controls Motorcycle Motor oil Diesel engine Toyota Prius Two-stroke cycle Strap-on dildo Shotgun Spark plug Bong Tank Chevrolet Corvair engine Internal combustion engine Jet engine Thermal power station Radio controlled airplane Tractor Space shuttle main engine Internal ballistics Professional wrestling holds Four-stroke cycle Hybrid vehicle Honda Prelude Turbocharger Fire fighting Dry cleaning Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Radio controlled car M16 (rifle) Ford Crown Victoria STS-51-L Automobile emissions control Mooney M20 Chevrolet Corvair Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Helicopter Fossil fuel power plant Air filter Siphon Steam engine Diode Rocket fuel Gnome Monosoupape Flamethrower Energy development Manual transmission Aerial (dance move) Transmission (mechanics) Drag racing Tire Swimming pool Rotary engine Explosive material Engine Control Unit Vacuum cleaner Turbojet Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Equine conformation Automobile Welding Incandescent light bulb Dialysis Bernoulli's principle P-61 Black Widow Lift (force) Combine harvester Spacecraft propulsion Alcohol fuel Vacuum tube Novelty (locomotive) Hydraulic machinery Hydrogen economy Solar power Ford Ranger EV B-47 Stratojet Professional wrestling throws Tunisia Campaign Rebreather Nuclear power Universal Serial Bus Apollo 8

a c draining water inside our air conditioner is clogged somewhere and it leaks water onto the carpet of our bedroom my husband won't be home until tomorrow to fix it is it safe to turn it on it's extrememly hot in here and just put towels down to catch the water until it's fixed it only leaks about a cup or two full of water i'm willing to clean up the mess in order to keep it cool in here it's about degrees in here it's a brand new model we just bought it last year doesn't have ice just water coming in and it's tipped as far back in the window as it will go safe to turn it on it really depends on what kind of model it is the older models used to have the circuitry board under the water recipient that comes build in with them when they licked water it was dangerous for these units to cause a short circuit somewhere along the way somebody figured out this problem and switched things around they put the circuitry on top of the water pan so you got to see where it is don't touch it just to avoid problems also see if it's got ice around it if it's got ice it can be that a c gas is escaping through somewhere i hope this helps sounds like it's safe to turn it on just keep your ears close to it in case you hear electric sounds which if it's new you will most likely not hear the sounds which means it's safe  Fire fighting Thermal power station Sento Menstrual cup Hearing aid Air conditioning Heinkel He 100 Toyota Prius Vacuum tube Solar power Refrigerator Sailing Transformer Rebreather Water Electrophysiology Circuit breaker Microwave oven Energy development Gas metal arc welding Social rule Dairy Nuclear power Diving Ice Carbon dioxide M16 (rifle) Skateboarding trick Baseball Seismic retrofit Home repair Mountaineering GunZ The Duel Spark plug Basement Glossary of firefighting terms Naruto jutsu True Crime: Streets of LA Hydrogen peroxide Floppy disk Aerial (dance move) Hearing impairment Magical objects in Harry Potter Circuit design Microphone Soldering Johnny 5 Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Cruising (maritime) Dialysis Poker jargon Space disaster West Bromwich Albion F.C.

how can we control the water dripping out of window unit ac we have a window unit air conditioner in our bedroom window in nyc we're on the third floor and water drips out onto the sidewalk i know that means that our unit is working great but our neighbors are angry about getting wet every time they step out our front door we can't begrudge them that how can we control the drip is there a tube or a tray we can purchase if we do need to control the water with a tube where can we get one and what is the best configuration since we are in a dense urban area and almost anywhere outside that we'd redirect the water we would be getting someone wet if moving the drip oe ft to the left or right would solve the problem i think that it would be easy to do it may also make it necessary to put the drain opening close to the building and would stain the outside over time and might have the landlord telling you not to do it i don't know if you can take the water back inside to a handy sink or bathtub drain but that would be a very good solution another is to put a pump and float on a reservoir and do it for a longer distance these combinations are sold for undercounter icemakers that do not have drains installed at the icemakers and i know that would work  Hydroponics Irrigation Thermal power station Sento Cruising (maritime) Solar power Carburetor Refrigerator Fire fighting Water Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Plumbing fixture Glossary of firefighting equipment Autonomous building Siphon Domestic water system Scuba set Seismic retrofit Basement Infusion pump Passenger car Air conditioning Naval mine Rapid transit Motorcycle Cannabis cultivation Glossary of wildland fire terms Glossary of firefighting terms IBM PC compatible Bladderwort Fujian tea ceremony Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Heinkel He 100 Microsoft Windows Coriolis effect Japanese toilet Kitchen De Lorean DMC-12 Urinary incontinence Ocean thermal energy conversion Carnivorous plant Station wagon Bong Electrical wiring Escalator Internal ballistics Fountain HVAC Automobile Urinal The Time Machine Frogman Water purification Wind turbine Drainage Equine conformation Ford Ranger EV Reservoir Dogs Tire Linux Central processing unit Elevator Strap-on dildo Vacuum cleaner Ice West Side Highway Hydraulic machinery Tank Diving suit P-47 Thunderbolt Fire hydrant Terran (StarCraft) Liquid breathing Richard Chase Traveling salesman problem Transistor Deep lake water cooling Soldering Wave power Blood Simple Window Bicycle frame Customs and etiquette of Japan Diving regulator Operational amplifier Port Authority Trans-Hudson Dymaxion house Mercury 4 Genetic algorithm Dishwashing Carbon dioxide Bart Sells His Soul Windows XP Toilet paper Fire extinguisher Brewery

hot please help i have a weather king central air unit and it just quit working last night we have had a problem with it leaking all over the floor into our hallway so we would put a towl down to catch the water but it still worked what could be the reason it will not work at all now the little thermostat will click like it does before it kicks on but nothing happens also my house is only years old so the unit should not have any roblems yet check your air filters if the filters are plugged up and not allowing enough air to pass over the evaporator coil the indoor unit will freeze up and turn into a giant ice cube that's one possibility where your water is coming from once the coil freezes up the outside unit will trip out a high head pressure switch it's ment to trip out and stop the compressor before it causes too much damamge some units will reset themselves after a period of time others will need to be reset manually i'm not aquainted with your specific unit so i can't tell you which you have an a c unit low on freon will freeze up in the exact same way yrs is plenty of time for problems to develop in a hvac system  Air conditioning Thermostat HVAC Refrigerator Furnace Carburetor Phase change heat pump Residual-current device Solar power Spark plug Climate of the United Kingdom Fluorescent lamp Apollo 13 Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Circuit breaker Water polo Coffee Two-stroke cycle Domestic AC power plugs and sockets STS-61 Water Axial compressor Nintendo GameCube X10 (industry standard) Hard disk Embedded system Poker jargon Autonomous building Incandescent light bulb Rebreather Jet engine Turbojet Space disaster Weathering Volleyball Water (molecule) Diesel engine E85 Swamp cooler Oscilloscope Ice hockey Tofu Loudspeaker Haloalkane Spacecraft propulsion Ice Football (soccer) Brewery Turbocharger Motorcycle Daylight saving time Transformer Stopping e-mail abuse Fog Antarctic krill Internal combustion engine Severe weather terminology (United States) National Football League Lore Windows XP Diablo II Supercharger Cyclone Cannabis cultivation Cray-1 Ocean thermal energy conversion Tag Heat Water vapor New York Giants Control system Refrigeration Fire alarm control panel Electrophysiology Carbon dioxide Frost Heinkel He 100 Stirling engine Diving regulator Capacitor plague Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Diving Irrigation Naruto jutsu M16 (rifle) Hydraulic machinery Mercury Atlas 6 Chevrolet Corvair engine STS-51-L Tide Cloud Switch Water supply Weather lore Fossil fuel power plant Welding Electric motor SR-71 Blackbird Gas absorption refrigerator

another question on identifying if a outlet exists without seeing it i checked the circuit breaker and there are switches stuck together and two spaces labeled washer dryer so i assume its a outlet when i asked the resident manager he assumed it was a because most of the townhouses have a stacked unit which has a the previous owners had a new circuit breaker put in so i am assuming it is a so does that mean there is more than one outlet back there i am asking because i want to switch from a stacked small apartment washer dryer to a separate front loading washer and dryer which requires a outlet for the dryer and one not sure if it is a or for the washer the current one is stacked and is in a small closet so i can't just pull it out if you have breakers that are connected together they will be volts volts each if the wires from both of these connected breakers go to the same outlet along with a common wire and hopefully a ground wire you will have a volt outlet however as these are actually separate breakers they could be running to outlets with each being volts the best and safest thing for you to do is check the voltage requirement for the washer and dryer that you have either by looking for a label or asking a dealer maintenance person or you can pull them out and check the outlet or outlets with a volt meter your new washer and dryer will require volts and volts respectfully  Circuit breaker Residual-current device Three-phase electric power Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Distribution board Spark plug Switch Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Fuse (electrical) Electrical wiring Relay Oscilloscope Transformer Alternating current National Electrical Code (US) BS 1363 Thermostat Ring circuit RS-232 Circuit design Capacitor Thermal power station Volt Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Operational amplifier Toronto Subway and RT Digital circuit Electricity meter Ground and neutral Split phase High-voltage hazards High-voltage direct current Ethernet Lineman (occupation) Spark gap Impedance matching Hall effect Decibel Electrical network Solar cell Overhead lines CMOS Tesla coil Battery (electricity) Logic gate Resistor Fan (implement) Electrical generator Phantom power Flush toilet Super Nintendo Entertainment System Hydraulic machinery Analog-to-digital converter Electrophysiology Variable Frequency Drive Potentiometer IPod Electric power transmission Switched-mode power supply Power strip Electrical wiring (UK) Washing machine Ampere Transistor Lightning rod Seismic retrofit Central processing unit Loudspeaker Rail terminology Ignition system Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis CPU design Floppy disk Lightning Antenna (radio) Electricity pylon Power (physics) Poker jargon USB flash drive Light switch Rapid transit X10 (industry standard) Earthing system George Westinghouse Cruising (maritime) 2003 North America blackout Galvanic cell Mains electricity Ground (electricity) Light-emitting diode Dimmer Microphone Oplan Bojinka Magnetic core memory

electricians please help we have no power in our basement what should we check the breaker hopefully this is the correct name the big switch that will flip if there is a problem is fine the switch breaker that the basement is on also does the washer and the washer is working fine i've checked everything else in the house and all is well in the basement there are some lights and a few outlets and none of them work nothing unusual has happened in the last few days and now nothing works down there the only thing my husband told me about was that there is a burned out lightbulb that the glass broke on when he tried to get it out and he left it in there he says it's the second to the last thing on the electric line down there and if it were that it would likely just effect it and the light after it what could i check what are the possibilities of problems any insight would be great if washer and lights are on the same breaker and the washer works and the lights don't you have a loose wire make sure the washer is on the same circuit by starting the washer and then flipping the basement breaker off if the washer quits your right it is on the basement circuit i would suggest you call an electrician to find your problem if your not sure what your doing if you want to try yourself the loose wire might be in the main power box or in the outlet box for the washer or in the next box in line you would have to look at each one and see if a wire is loose do it with the power off while your at it fix or change out the light fixture with the broken light  Residual-current device Switch Fuse (electrical) Incandescent light bulb Distribution board Electrician National Electrical Code (US) Circuit breaker Electrical wiring (UK) Basement Three-phase electric power Ring circuit BS 1363 Relay Stage lighting Thermostat Overhead lines Debugging Digital circuit Light switch Cruising (maritime) Circuit design Oscilloscope X10 (industry standard) Tesla coil Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Battery (electricity) Fluorescent lamp Burglar alarm Poker jargon Hydraulic machinery Enigma machine Power strip Ground and neutral Electric motor Alternating current Professional wrestling throws Dimmer Vacuum tube Ignition system Transformer Lighting Maxwell's equations Liquid crystal display Central processing unit 2003 North America blackout STS-61 Carburetor Electrical wiring Toronto Subway and RT Solar power Cliff Richard Thermal power station Apollo Guidance Computer Semiconductor device High-voltage direct current Printed circuit board CPU cache Professional wrestling match types Electronic amplifier Directed-energy weapon Transistor Antenna (radio) Shen Gong Wu Ethernet Ocean's Twelve Robot Wars Solar cell Mattress The Basement Tapes Mercury-vapor lamp Hall effect Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Impedance matching Resistor Railway signal Magnetic core memory Lightning Capacitor Lineman (occupation) Knife Diode Electrophysiology Cryptanalysis Bombe Electrical breakdown GunZ The Duel Rose (Doctor Who) Logic gate Electrical generator Electrical resistance Gas metal arc welding Jumpstart 3rd Grade E85 Home repair Daylight saving time Screw Armored Core

should the level of water in my septic tank rise when it rains a lot we've been having problems with our septic tank filling and backing into the basement we found a toilet that had been leaking for months and once we turned the toilet off and conserved water the water level in the septic tank went back to normal for the past month my husband and i have only let water from flushing the toilets and from the dishwasher which i only run once week go down the drain everything else bathwater kitchen sink washing machine we take outside in buckets to give the leach bed time to dry out in the past week we started letting some bathwater go down the drain and the tank didn't seem to have any problems with it then yesterday we had a series of storms that dropped about inches of rain when i checked the tank this morning the water level was of the way up the height of the inlet pipe is this normal or should i be concerned that something is clogged or that the water table is too high when this first happened june i did have a professional come out and look he pumped it jetted it and in days it was full again he did say after he jetted it the leach bed was taking water but he saw water coming in the tank when no one was home the leaking toilet we had the septic enforcement agency come out and look and she said our next step would be to cautiously dig around the tank and look for cracks but since the water level didn't rise again before today we thought the problem was fixed i hate to dig the whole tank up and inspect it if the problem is just a saturated drain field from the rain that's why i was just wondering if the water level going up after a lot of rain was normal also i do not have a sump pump no construction in the area and the reason i know the level is that there is an access pipe coming up from the tank where the pumper accesses the tank the water is not backing into the basement yet well you should have it pumped and checked to make sure that everything is ok we had the same problem and yes water from rain will go in there the problem is most likely what you said the leach fields are drenched and there is no where for the water to go if there has been some construction in your area or a bunch of trees were cut down this could be your problem as well the leach fields are being stripped away and are completely useless when there is not enough room for the water to go where it needs to we found that by planting a few trees in the yard and starting a small garden it helps tomatos love to live by a septic tank however you should have it checked to make sure that there are not cracks and that the places where the water leaves the tank are not clogged we are getting onto public sewers soon it is just becoming available to us so we are trying to make this tank last until they have the plant up and running because they will charge us to connect to the main lines good luck you should be able to let all of your water go out there so something is wrong and calling in a service man may be your best bet  Autonomous building Thermal power station Basement Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Siphon Flush toilet Drainage Domestic water system Toilet paper Cruising (maritime) Sewer Toilet Irrigation Carburetor Dairy Kitchen Japanese toilet Poker jargon Home repair Dialysis Pit toilet Energy development Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Bong Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Water purification USS Tunny (SS-282) E85 Water supply Sento CPU cache RuneScape Mini-Games The Fens Brewery Plumbing fixture Menstrual cup Urinary incontinence Operation Market Garden Zuiderzee Works Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Borehole Eutrophication Betting (poker) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jet engine Chatsworth House USS Trigger (SS-237) Carbon dioxide Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Dishwasher Wildfire Elis Prefecture Transformer Las Vegas metropolitan area RuneScape quests Glossary of firefighting terms 2003 North America blackout Naval mine Hydroponics Nuclear power Hamster King City, Ontario The Star Wars Holiday Special Sewage collection and disposal Toilet humour Sin City Hydrogen economy Three Mile Island Married... with Children Draw poker Chernobyl accident 2005 Maharashtra floods Composting toilet 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Opportunity rover Fossil fuel power plant Lake Burley Griffin Eifel Aqueduct Vacuum Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 USS S-35 (SS-140) Blood on the Tracks Tobacco Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Dam Desert USS Aylwin (DD-355)

how to test outlet for power i have a cheap ohm meter or whatever it's called haven't used it in a long time i have an outlet that does not work i want to test the power supply to see if i have power do i just hold one piece of the tester to the hot and neutral wire does it matter which one i hold where no the outlet does not work i want to test the power supply to the outlet to determine whether there is power there or not if there is i'll know it's just the outlet and it needs replaced working with live electrical current can be hazardous do not attempt this measurement without the proper tools and safeguards always test your test equipment for proper operation before use turn on any wall switches that may control an outlet it is surprising the number of times an electrician will be called out for a non functioning outlet only to solve it by flipping a switch another thing to check is that the circuit breaker or fuse is intact and that no gfci outlet controlling the branch has tripped testing an outlet can be as simple as plugging in a light to see if it goes on of course always test your test equipment first if that light doesn't work and you test an outlet and assume there is no current because the light doesn't go on you may be in for a shock a more thorough way to test electrical outlets involves the use of an outlet tester this device will not only indicate if the outlet has power it will also indicate if the outlet is grounded and whether the hot and common wires are reversed the device could not be easier to use and costs only a few dollars generally you plug the device in and note the pattern of the lights the legend printed on the device describes what the lights indicate follow all of the instructions provided by the manufacturer if a outlet is identified as being miswired or does not have proper ground you should not use the outlet until the problem is resolved in the case of a miswired outlet or absent ground the problem may occur at the problem outlet or somewhere else in the branch circuit do some detective work to determine the extent of the problem before attempting any repairs  National Electrical Code (US) Circuit breaker BS 1363 Digital circuit Transformer Oscilloscope Three-phase electric power Circuit design Fuse (electrical) Computer Spark plug Distribution board Telephone exchange Transistor Vacuum tube Earthing system Relay Alternating current Embedded system Switch Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Central processing unit Operational amplifier Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Electricity STS-61 X10 (industry standard) Ethernet RS-232 Universal Serial Bus Power strip Ground and neutral Incandescent light bulb Electric motor Diode Lawn mower Resistor Audiophile Thermostat Fusion power Electrical wiring (UK) Electrophysiology Impedance Carburetor Solar power Musical Instrument Digital Interface Loudspeaker Ohm's law Enigma machine Magnetic core memory Electrical wiring Collision detection Extreme Programming USB flash drive Capacitor Overhead lines Electricity meter Electrician Printed circuit board Amateur telescope making Fluorescent lamp Voice over IP Lineman (occupation) High-voltage direct current Impedance matching Radar Current (electricity) Ground (electricity) Electrical generator Light switch Jack plug Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Airport Antenna (radio) Lightning Lighting Rail terminology Gas metal arc welding Hall effect Password Surveillance Solar cell Reliability engineering CPU cache Seismometer Hydraulic machinery Telephone Semiconductor device Information warfare Electrical network Integrated circuit Mains electricity Transmission line

the shoe organizer is hung behind the door in the long run will it be bad for the door matt is absolutely right if the shoe organizer is only supported from the top then it will inevitably move and bang against the door it is a would be a good idea to secure the bottom as well screws or tacks are the common solution but as you do not wish to harm the door i would suggest using double sided tape or self adhesive velcro strips both will work quite well but for my money the velcro is the best option i hope this helps take care and good luck c j  Upholstery Horseshoe 1957 World Series Tack Zipper Shoe Blackjack Door Urinary incontinence Stairway Genericized trademark Equine conformation Horse tack Adhesive Professional wrestling throws Violin Cheating in poker Rainbow Islands Singapore Police Force Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers International Phonetic Alphabet Mechanical advantage Glossary of climbing terms American Gladiators Chu-Han contention Ford Thunderbird Charles Goodyear Inspector Gadget Utilitarianism Footwear Rigging Professional wrestling attacks Winning Streak Wheel of Fortune Redundant array of independent disks Connection Poker jargon French Defence Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Clown Reebok Professional wrestling slang Karma Non-aggression principle Undergarment Masking tape Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bionics Trapping Dog agility Drill bit Spring operating system Ed, Edd n Eddy Force (Star Wars) Motor oil Mattress April Fool's Day Free trade Wonderland (McFly album) Customs and etiquette of Japan Luck Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Volkswagen Type 2 (T3) Motility Badminton Static Shock Anchor Inflation Conker's Bad Fur Day B-47 Stratojet Mercantilism Sailing 2004 World Series Qiang The Doors Professional wrestling match types Bladderwort Evil Let's Make a Deal Refrigerator Suit (clothes) Fast bowling Tears for Fears Nikita Khrushchev Third rail Psychiatric hospital Drag racing Journey (band) Bolted joint Sermon on the Mount Shit Pet Sounds Mario The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters The Comic Strip Elevator Volleyball Monty Hall problem

oil furnace versus natural gas furnace pros and cons anybody interested whether heating with natural gas is cleaner or greener than oil which is cheaper to use etcetera i've had oil and natural gas furnaces and prefer the natural gas to oil i always found the the oil heat forced air furnace left a funny smell in the house which i found unpleasant where i live natural gas is actually cheaper than oil and i don't have to worry about having the tank filled before the chilly season i like the natural gas because i pay for what i use as i use it and don't get a big old bill like i used to when i filled the tank all that being said propane is even cheaper than natural gas but you still have to have a big old ugly tank somewhere out in the yard at least my oil tank was underground and you still get the big old bill when you have it filled our utility provider is running ads right now hyping the fact that natural gas is cleaner burning and greener than oil  Natural gas Propane Hydrogen economy Solar power Petroleum Energy development Furnace Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Thermal power station Coal Filling station Copper extraction Fossil fuel power plant Explosive material Motor oil E85 Autonomous building Future energy development Gas turbine-electric locomotive Biodiesel Gas turbine Carburetor Fire fighting Wood fuel Power station Plastic Open hearth furnace Barbecue Alternative fuel Alcohol fuel Kerosene lamp Fuel injection Diesel engine Portable stove Vacuum Locomotive Incineration Combustion Turbocharger HVAC Flamethrower Nuclear power Derbyshire lead mining history Tank Fire Automobile Hybrid vehicle Liquified petroleum gas Cracking (chemistry) Swimming pool Central heating Nuclear power phase-out RuneScape Mini-Games Kitchen Casting Spark plug Cogeneration Balloon (aircraft) Bong Alkane Renewable energy Fuel cell Cremation Sewage treatment Hydrogen sulfide Hydrogen vehicle Carbon monoxide Methanethiol Boiler Steel Turquoise Stove Titanium Pebble bed reactor Water heater Two-stroke cycle New York Giants ExxonMobil Ammonia Carbon dioxide Xenon Sport utility vehicle Automobile emissions control Sulfur Piccolo Junior Saga Biofuel Waste-to-energy plant Saudi Aramco Smoke-screen Gasoline Oxyacetylene Novelty (locomotive) Sulfuric acid Rocket fuel Aircraft engine controls Helium Oil refinery Arturo Frondizi

shallow well jet pump question my pump has suddenly started kicking on about once a minute even when water is not being used i know there is no leak anywhere in the system why would the system lose pressure and need to kick on frankly i don't understand how the water stays under pressure in the pressure tank why doesn't the water go back into the well as soon as the pump turns off i suspect that the jet pump has some type of device built in that prevents the water from flowing back and that this is where my problem lies is there a simple seal that i can replace your help is greatly appreciated in advance i would guess the check valve or foot valve is leaking that is what keeps the water under pressure that you are wondering about sometimes they start to leak allowing the pressure to drop usually with a shallow well the check valve is near the pump look for a brass fitting in the pipe email if you need more help  Carburetor Flush toilet Hydraulic machinery Siphon Pump Rebreather Thermal power station Glossary of firefighting equipment Jet engine Three Mile Island Two-stroke cycle Electrophysiology Thermostat Irrigation Steam engine Brewery Diving cylinder Newcomen steam engine Tire Aircraft flight control systems Water supply Vacuum E85 Flamethrower Borehole Turbocharger Containment building Naval mine Dialysis Glossary of firefighting terms Drowning Snorkel Dairy Tap (valve) Oxy-fuel welding and cutting B-47 Stratojet Solar power Manifold vacuum Sleeve valve Water hammer Air brake (rail) Fossil fuel power plant Stirling engine Scuba set Novelty (locomotive) Carbon dioxide Atrial septal defect Energy development Seismic retrofit Rail terminology Apollo Command/Service Module Pulse jet engine Bong Supercharger Steam locomotive nomenclature Diving regulator Water tower Ocean thermal energy conversion Turbojet Hydrogen economy Gas compressor Cardiac cycle Water purification Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Programmable logic controller Fire hydrant Space Shuttle external tank Mercury arc valve Domestic water system Tier One Water turbine Diving suit Cavitation Trombone Firefighter Apollo 13 Timeline of steam power Heat Vacuum tube USS Tunny (SS-282) Mitral regurgitation Floodgate Internal ballistics Fluid bearing Autonomous building Canal lock SR-71 Blackbird Sailing ballast Heart valve New York Giants Russian joke Automatic transmission STS-61 Aortic insufficiency

ok let me try again inside unit on a c and heater needs to be replaced sq ft house story anyone know the average cost this is just the inside unit that needs replacing the a c guy is telling me the inside cooling coil is rotted from improper cleaning from the previous owners we have a home warranty but the a c guy told me the whole inside unit will need to be replaced because of the age of the system approx years meaning the whole inside until needs replacing the outside compressor is fine so average cost anyone the home warranty will only cover up to people i just want someone to tell me the average cost to replace the inside unit that is all i need i apologize but i don't need advice about nd opinions or the home warranty i need to know how much it's a rheem southeast usa electric heat and air i'm in sc the outside unit is a condenser i guess it doesnt have a heat pump your not getting the answer because it's difficult to say a sq ft house is pretty small and shouldn't require a coil that would cost the installer to usd including labor markup and costs for the refrigerant and disregarding that you might live in a high cost of living area where contractors charge more for service and if your system used an obsolete type of refrigerant it should cost to usd however there are a few other considerations like distance to travel and location of the unit if its difficult to get to it'll cost more it seems that we immediately distrust the contractor mainly because we've been burned by them in the past i would talk to a few other companies if it is the coil gone bad they should be able to braze the holes  Air conditioning Refrigerator Solar power Thermal power station HVAC Thermostat Phase change heat pump Tesla coil Heat pump Furnace Fossil fuel power plant Diesel engine Home repair Spark plug Transformer Welding Ocean thermal energy conversion Heat exchanger Swamp cooler Wind power Gas compressor Energy development Loudspeaker Stirling engine Carburetor Heinkel He 100 Soldering Toyota Prius Cray-1 Internal ballistics Turbocharger Kitchen Mars Exploration Rover Motor oil Brazing Refrigeration Spacecraft propulsion Vacuum tube Stove Drill bit Hydrogen economy Incandescent light bulb Natural gas Internal combustion engine Solar cell Trans-Alaska Pipeline System Dairy Vacuum Tire Electric motor Supercharger SR-71 Blackbird Jet engine Laserdisc Ford Ranger EV Torpedo Steam engine Printed circuit board Three-phase electric power Electrical wiring Brewery Relay Basement Chevrolet Corvair Microphone Turbojet Pebble bed reactor Wind turbine Haloalkane Oscilloscope Gas absorption refrigerator Electricity meter Wood fuel Bass guitar Mattress Warranty IPod Solar panel Alternating current Tank Bleed air Magnet Cruising (maritime) Elevator Apollo 13 Refrigerator car Casting General Dynamics F-111 Carbon dioxide Hydrogen vehicle Windows 2000 Irrigation Sega Saturn Samovar Inkjet printer Train Geothermal exchange heat pump Gas tungsten arc welding Wire

ice machine broken please help i'm having problems getting ice to come down through the hatch the ice machine is making ice but it won't rotate so the ice will fall down the hatch my water button is fine and dispense the water perfectly i change the fuse like thing on the back of the refigator not long ago i'm thinking the problem is the motor that rotate the ice is broken or mess up that's why it won't rotate the ice when i press either the crushed or cube ice nothing happen no sounds at all any recommendation is greatly appreciated thanks sounds like you are on the right track it's hard to say if the motor is bad there could be a switch or something bad as well you have to turn it on and check for voltage at the motor terminal if no voltage is present then it probably is not a bad motor if voltage is present when you try to dispense ice then the motor is probably shot if you changed the fuse and it worked before then maybe something is hindering the rotation and that causes the motor to draw high amperage and eventually blows the fuse again sounds like everything else is in good shape some of those things are electronic and could be hard to troubleshoot without more information that the owners manual will provide it could be that the whole electronic board is bad a lot of times that is what they replace and a lot of times that is the first thing they try of course they have one on their truck and don't have to take a chance on buying one just to take a shot in the dark or they may replace the board first if that doesn't fix it they will change the motor and tell you that they were both bad and you pay for both plus labor that's typical those things are a pain in the ass to work on and are usually repaired by people who specialize in household appliances or they are the authorized service professionals for that particular brand  Pinball Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Bulk vending Mouse (computing) Wind turbine Tank Transformer Floppy disk Thermal power station Circuit design Welding Embedded system Babe Ruth Oscilloscope Vacuum tube Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Diving Toyota Prius Gramophone record Fuse (electrical) Resistor Drill bit Windows XP E85 STS-61 High-voltage direct current Cruising (maritime) Electrical generator Fan (implement) Pump It Up Debugging Electronic amplifier Mattress Sampling (music) George Westinghouse Carburetor Time Out of Mind Battery electric vehicle Digital circuit Alternating current Shit Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Firearm Tire Theory of conduct Equine conformation Transistor Magnet Motor oil Electrophysiology Piezoelectricity Slot machine Refrigerator Diode True Crime: Streets of LA Electricity meter Circuit breaker Mountaineering Chris Amon American Motors Computer Blackjack Manual transmission Shaggy dog story Internal ballistics Shen Gong Wu Blood on the Tracks USS Tunny (SS-282) Coffee Stage lighting Ecco the Dolphin Internal combustion engine Phonograph Microeconomics Wheel of Fortune Supply and demand Humphrey Bogart Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Lathe IBM PC compatible Skateboarding trick Potentiometer General Motors Alternator Violin Switch Current (electricity) Drag racing Relay

how long can i have the furnace fan on for is it ok for the fan motor to be on most of the day when the ac is off just to circulate the air you can run the fan indefinitely without causing any damage to it as it is designed to be run contuinously the only problem with this will be power consumption a ac blower motor in the to hp range will pull anywhere from to amps to figure power usage multiply the amps times the volts this will give you watts multiply this times hours and this gives you watt hours so a motor pulling amps at volts is watts per hour that would equal out to watt hours per day it would cost a lot to do this and even more if you have a bigger motor than a hp  Transformer Vacuum cleaner Volt Solar power Power (physics) Fan (implement) Incandescent light bulb Electric motor Circuit design Operational amplifier Resistor Bicycle lighting Fossil fuel power plant Electronic amplifier Decibel Solar panel Wind power Battery (electricity) Three-phase electric power Horsepower Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Propeller Galileo spacecraft Hard disk Electrical generator Electricity meter Furnace Super Nintendo Entertainment System Torque BS 1363 Thermal power station Two-stroke cycle Fuel injection E85 Supercharger Battery electric vehicle CMOS VIA C3 Effective radiated power Electricity Ford Motor Company Jet engine Hybrid vehicle Sport utility vehicle Thermostat Ford Ranger EV Pok__mon Abilities Solar cell 24 Hours of Le Mans Toyota Prius Central processing unit X10 (industry standard) XERF Watts riots Digital circuit Large numbers Piezoelectricity Labour economics Headlight Athlon 64 Nuclear power Automobile Loudspeaker Motor oil Bass guitar Daylight saving time Ampere Lawn mower Microwave oven Diode Fluorescent lamp Apollo 13 Bussard ramjet USCGC Conifer (WLB-301) Aircraft Solar power satellite Muscle Welding power supply EastEnders Glider Kenwood Electronics Novelty (locomotive) Newcomen steam engine Control system MIM-23 Hawk Particle accelerator USS Zane (DD-337) Locomotive Energy development Air conditioning James Watt Microeconomics Radiation poisoning M16 (rifle) Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Engine Pentium M Brewery Steam engine High-voltage hazards

what's wrong with this sewing machine i am taking at a sewing machine that isn't working it makes two or three stitches before locking up with a tangle of thread that ruins the material and can only be removed from the machine by taking out the bobbin shuttle it appears that loops of thread are catching on the hook causing the tangle what is wrong with it and can it be fixed at home what i've neglected to mention is that this problem occured after some heavy sewing through some heavy material i am wondering particularly if this could be that the machine's timing is off out but i don't know enough about sewing machines to know if this is the case or if it's something else or how to fix it if it is the timing having just looked a little more closely it seems that the top thread is catching on the hook but it's not releasing and sliding around the bobbin as i assume it should there could be several reasons why it isn't working the tension could be off which side of the fabric is the tangle on if the bottom clean out the bobbin area well and check the tension of the bobbin if on the top check the thread tension it is also possible that the thread you are using is not compatible with the machine sometimes that happens it could also be something else if the machine's balance is off messing with the tension and cleaning it won't necessarily help in that case you'd have to take it in to get it looked at  Sewing machine Textile manufacturing Textile manufacturing terminology Sewing Knitting Glossary of climbing terms Lace-making Drill bit Weaving Cotton mill Mattress Wire Upholstery Poker jargon Suture Mach kernel Friends Crochet Blood on the Tracks Climbing equipment Lathe Bong Floppy disk Carpet Space elevator Halting problem Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Social rule Tire IBM PC compatible Embroidery Compiler optimization Kilt String theory Debugging Tatting Windows XP Movie projector Mary Poppins Rigging Screw Equine conformation Violin Thermal power station Hydraulic machinery Floyd Rose Datatype Betting (poker) Aerial (dance move) Spinlock Wound LOOM Shaggy dog story Knife Freehand lace Classified information Condom Seine (fishing) Helicopter Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Fiddler on the Roof Suplex Glossary of firefighting equipment Kitesurfing C programming language Chess strategy and tactics CPU design Machine gun M16 (rifle) Atari 8-bit family Table saw Time travel Dry cleaning Radiohead M60 machine gun Slide rule Combine harvester Bicycle brake systems G__del's incompleteness theorem GLOCK Law of value CPU cache Pitaten STS-61 Metalworking Spinning wheel Applique Glossary of nautical terms Characters in the Smurfs Vise (tool) Cross-stitch Tattoo Space Shuttle program

what's an easy and inexpensive way to stop rain gutters from leaking at the seams i thought there'd be some kind if gutter sealant in the hardware store but when i went there to inquire the guy said they didn't carry any and besides they don't work that well any opinions on this or suggestions about repairs yes there is a caulk made for gutters flashing etc get it at lowe's etc should do the trick but on a side note you might want to look into why they are leaking at the seams if the gutter is not sloped properly water is just going to stand in the gutter which will cause it to leak whereas if the water was flowing freely it would be less likely to leak  Basement Deck (ship) Soldering Roof Fast bowling Geodesic dome Road Glossary of nautical terms Ice dam Home repair Energy development Double bass Plame affair Welding Apollo 8 Autonomous building Solar power Irrigation Aerial (dance move) Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Digital circuit Vacuum tube Tire Fuel cell Menstrual cup Knife Skateboarding trick Boat building Seismic retrofit Bicycle lighting Plame affair timeline Trusted computing Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Avalanche Gore-Tex Equine conformation Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder Ionizing radiation Rail terminology Floppy disk IBM PC compatible 24 Hours of Le Mans Commodore 64 Laserdisc Sears Holdings Corporation Milton H.

i have a plumbing question my kitchen faucet looks very similar to this one http www homeannex com prodview asp idproduct srccode cii cpncode a few days ago i replaced one of the faucet handles since it was stripped but when i tried to remove the other one it wouldn't budge i've tried everything i can think of short of dynamite but i suspect the stem is rusted to the inside of the handle before i rip the thing out and replace it entirely which would be a pain since there aren't any under sink shut off valves does anyone have any suggestions myke cyndy i'm planning to do that sometime soon but one thing at a time if necessary you should be able to shut off the water at the water main or some other location in your house if you do that then you might want to plan on adding shutoff valves at this faucet and other faucets and toilet supplies in your house too have you tried using a faucet handle puller you can get one at a hardware or building supply store these websites show pictures of various types http www plumbingsupply com handles html http www doityourself com icat handlepullers http www amazon com s ref pd rs ie utf search alias tools field keywords faucet puller you might be able to work some liquid wrench into the handle through the screw hole to make it easier to remove the handle tapping on the handle with a hammer after you squirt in some liquid wrench may help work the liquid wrench into the handle be careful hammering and pulling on it because you might damage the supply pipe coming going through the wall or the joint between the supply pipe and the faucet you may need to keep soaking it with liquid wrench in between attempts to loosen the handle which will tend to slowly work the liquid wrench into the rusted places better  Wrench Tap (valve) Screw Drill bit Sento Siphon Handloading Bong Plumbing fixture World Wide Web Irrigation Samovar Seismic retrofit Urinal Kitchen Flush toilet Nuclear power Gmail Home repair Website Toilet paper Thermal power station Hydraulic machinery Internal ballistics Fire hydrant Brewery Combine (Half-Life 2) Metalworking Professional wrestling holds PHP Floppy disk M16 (rifle) Domestic water system Ajax (programming) Common Unix Printing System Unicode Computer forensics Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Textile manufacturing Knife Rebreather Perl Apollo 13 Tap wrench Fecal incontinence Phishing Opportunity rover Mozilla Firefox CPU cache Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Soldering Borehole Genericized trademark Furnace Hamster Plastic Dishwasher Upholstery Carbon dioxide Oplan Bojinka Trombone BS 1363 Weapons of Star Trek C programming language Glossary of wildland fire terms Mosquito Forge Renewable energy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Motor oil HyperText Transfer Protocol Urinary incontinence Dairy Spyware Solar power Bolted joint Cruising (maritime) Scuba set Casting Web server Aluminium Autonomous building Salad Fingers Novelty (locomotive) Energy development HTML Diving cylinder

could a clogged sprinkler valve cause wall leaks in my home we just recently purchased a year old home we have been having some plumbing issues right off the bat the dishwasher does not drain well the sprinklers stayed on all night the night before last turned off the timers which did not work so i turned off the backflow which did work sprinkler guy is scheduled to come out to repair the valve today however this morning woke up and water was dripping from an interior entryway cant tell where it was coming from since it was dripping from the casing could this all be related i turned off the outdoor water valve and the dripping stopped all very odd if a coincidence thanks in advance thanks to those who have answered so far the house was vacant for a month maybe two it is a two story home i opened the backflow again for a bit then closed it and dripping has stopped unsure if that did the trick or turning off the the outside valve though it sounds like there is too much of a coincidence that the wall leak occurred just when you tried the sprinkler system i surmise that the sprinkler shutoff valve is between the leak and the sprinkler system that would definitely increase the pressure at your leak when the valve is shut off you will likely have to get into the wall and hopefully repair just a leak worst case is bad pipes thin wall copper begins to leak after some ageing particularly in un environmentally unfriendly areas  Irrigation Glossary of firefighting equipment Siphon Fire hydrant Three Mile Island Home repair Heart sounds Glossary of firefighting terms Flush toilet Drip irrigation Fire Sprinkler Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Thermal power station 2000 Australian Grand Prix Urinary incontinence Domestic water system Rebreather Tire Containment building Meat Loaf Plumbing fixture Basement Dialysis Hurricane Rita Heart Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Space shuttle main engine Carburetor Coffee Diving regulator Kitchen USS S-44 (SS-155) Sleeve valve Water hammer Hydraulic machinery Seismic retrofit Elevator Programmable logic controller Diving cylinder Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster USS Tunny (SS-282) Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Oxyacetylene Trombone Steam engine Variable valve timing Four-stroke cycle Atrial septal defect Carlsbad Caverns National Park Half-Life Aortic valve stenosis Solar power Embedded system USS Wasp (CV-18) Furnace USS S-37 (SS-142) Mosquito Urinal Team Fortress Classic USS S-38 (SS-143) International League Bong USS Yorktown (CV-5) Manifold vacuum Apollo Command/Service Module Portable stove Cardiac cycle Dundas Square Firefighter Autonomous building Final Fantasy magic Plame affair Automatic transmission Welding Aortic dissection Fuel injection Air brake (rail) Hebden Bridge Christmas tree Snorkel Aortic insufficiency Spark plug STS-86 Cannabis cultivation STS-61 Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Battles of Lexington and Concord Newcomen steam engine Blood Simple Dalek (Doctor Who episode) Thermostat Combine (Half-Life 2) The Amber Spyglass Intravenous therapy Nirvana (band) Hydroponics Soldering Babe Ruth

why does my metal light switch faceplate lightly vibrate when switched on this is a recent discovery by me when switching on a light that does not get used very often i took the faceplate off this morning and nothing seems obviously wrong on the inside i e wires sticking out and touching the plate it does not shock or spark when touched is this something i can fix should i call an electrican for what seems like a minor problem should i ignore it and not worry too much since it is not used daily or for long periods of time thanks we could go into some trouble shooting but fir the price of a switch change it and if the vibration goes away hooray' if not little loss and we move to the next step at which time a little more info would be nice  Switch Violin Light switch Guitar Welding Lathe Glossary of climbing terms Firearm Knife Tank Transformer Piano Fluorescent lamp GunZ The Duel Overhead lines Game Boy Micro Relay Telephone exchange Electric guitar Digital photography Harmonic series (music) Diode Professional wrestling throws Fan (implement) Jumpstart 3rd Grade Lathe (metal) Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Baseball Double bass Mitsubishi 3000GT Badminton Wire wrap Professional wrestling slang Transistor Cathode ray tube IPod Piezoelectricity Digital Faster-than-light Charles Wheatstone Futurama (TV series - season 5) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Telephone numbering plan Enron Corporation Xbox 360 Rotary dial Gemini 9A Daylight saving time Softball Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Volleyball Aluminium Digital circuit Static Shock Debugging Action potential Ice hockey Tesla coil Tire Glossary of American football Game controller Stage lighting Vacuum tube Central processing unit Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Aarti Hand grenade Laser engraving Gas metal arc welding Harp Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys Solar power Mouse (computing) WQHT (FM) Nuclear weapon design Nintendo DS Electroshock gun PlayStation 2 Loudspeaker Virtual memory X-ray Monty Hall problem Circuit design The Time Machine Sumo Reservoir Dogs Gaussian elimination Burglar alarm Timpani Potentiometer Harmonica Land mine Hydrogen economy 2003 North America blackout Mercury Cougar Rail tracks Floppy disk

what should be the temperature of the kitchen the person who is cooking and the person paying the electricity bills may have different opinions when cooking i like to just use the stovetop on hot days and reserve the oven until the temp is below in the kitchen in many hot places summer kitchens are built away from the house this would give better ventilation to the kitchen from all sides and keep the house cooler no cooking fire heat in the winter the kitchen may be the warmest and most cozy room in the house but in the summer the poor cook appreciates either cooling it down to under degrees or else making salads until the heat breaks  Stove Kitchen Cookware and bakeware Wok Temperature Microwave oven Solar power Barbecue HVAC Refrigerator K__ppen climate classification Air conditioning Heat Climate of the United Kingdom Renewable energy Thermoregulation Slow cooker Arizona Stir frying Sauna Cuisine of Denmark Urban heat island Portable stove Hyperthermia Mediterranean climate Sun Fire extinguisher Brewery Hot air balloon Bread Courtyard Spark plug Cooking Peltier-Seebeck effect Autonomous building Plastic Fire Furnace Central heating Stirling engine Ceramics Bacon Deep lake water cooling Sento Jewish cuisine Dishwasher Fire-walking Pea Rice cooker Motor oil Glossary of firefighting terms Climate of Salt Lake City Toaster Radon Anchorage, Alaska Welding Sauerkraut Climate of India Thermal power station Passive solar Ice cream Biofuel Explosive material Chicago Heat Wave of 1995 Thermostat Xanadu House Potato salad Dairy USS S-37 (SS-142) Fuzzy logic Dundas Square Water (molecule) Windcatcher Cooking oil Lighting Haloalkane Severe weather terminology (United States) Heat index Bowen, Queensland Cooler Shotgun house Solar cell Windscale fire Ventilation Convection European heat wave of 2003 Coffee Black pepper Frankfurt kitchen Pizza Scramjet Heat pump Swamp cooler Cooking on a campfire Vacuum tube Mercury Atlas 6 Seismic retrofit Hell's Kitchen (television) Engine cooling

my toilet keeps running after being flushed is there an easy fix the problem is that the stopper plug doesn't return directly in the hole immediately after a flush i tried shortening and lengthening the chain to no avail to fix the problem each time i have to reach into the tank and place the stopper plug directly into the hole why can't it do that on its own how can i fix it if you've tried adjusting the chain the next step would be replacing the flapper that's the part you're referring to as the stopper plug sometimes flappers just don't seal well when they get old the rubber can get stiff or brittle sometimes especially on cheap flappers the chain can snag on itself when you flush turn off the water to the toilet pull off the old flapper and chain and take it to the hardware store a new flapper won't cost more than the job shouldn't take more than an hour  Flush toilet Carburetor Japanese toilet Glossary of climbing terms Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Menstrual cup Toilet paper Energy development Spark plug Motorcycle Thermostat IPod Tire Floppy disk CPU cache Strap-on dildo Hash table Drill bit Redundant array of independent disks Dairy Homer Simpson Toilet E85 Plastic Brewery Flapper Autonomous building M16 (rifle) Equine conformation Personal computer Condom Hydroponics Commodore 64 Bong Sailing Corrosion Knot Fecal incontinence Thermal power station Windows XP Siphon Poker jargon Cruising (maritime) Dr. Cossack Hydrogen economy Scrabble (game show) Undergarment Texas hold 'em Virtual memory AmigaOS Cray-1 IBM PC Clinker (boat building) Just In Time PLATO Windows 2000 Diving suit Washroom Computer forensics Modem Naval mine Slot machine Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Locomotive Domestic water system Expert system USS Vestal (AR-4) Urinal Hard disk Solar power Sewage treatment Violin Atari ST Toilet humour Fountain pen Reading spark plugs for racing Nuclear power Computer Coupling (railway) Diving Nintendo Entertainment System Gramophone record Debugging Robot Master Rebreather Enigma machine Baroque chess Rigging Plumbing fixture Textile manufacturing Rail tracks Cribbage Glossary of American football Capacitor plague Married... with Children Embedded system Conker's Bad Fur Day BS 1363 RISC Heinkel He 112

is there a way to remove scratches from a pane of glass maybe some glass experts can post some suggestions but the only thing i can think of and it's a long shot but i think your best and only shot is depending on how many and how severe the scratches are to try heating the area with an open flame like a propane torch you may be able to soften the scratches a little with this if the pane is in place and the glass melts too much you will probably ruin it ideally you'd want the glass out and resting flat if you feel this is worth while i think there are places that make such repairs but i suspect they are horrendously expensive best of luck  Glass Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Diamond simulant Fiberglass Soldering Incandescent light bulb Hot air balloon Float glass Bong Lathe Image scanner Welding John Hancock Tower Glassblowing Solar cell Window Gas metal arc welding Material properties of diamond Diamond enhancement Billiards Sunglasses Solar power Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Dundas Square The Big Break Disc brake Seismic retrofit Brazing Mercury 4 Internal ballistics Glasses Steel Winning Streak Spark plug Champagne (beverage) Polyethylene terephthalate Columbine High School massacre Pottery Insulation Plastic Repouss__ and chasing Olympic Flame Seismometer Cremation Mattress Aluminium Door Opportunity rover Trailer Park Boys Casting Menstrual cup Printed circuit board Optical fiber Flamethrower Snowball Earth Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Neon sign Fuel injection Cryonics Bullet catch Forge View camera Slide rule Cube (film) Airsoft Printmaking Bunsen burner Parable of the broken window Kerosene lamp Rei Ayanami Abiogenic petroleum origin Compact disc Iron Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Fire Gothic Revival architecture Glossary of climbing terms Shoe Cross-country skiing Propane Ceramics Cookware and bakeware B3ta Human Torch Piccolo Junior Saga Flat tax Flame Stroke Thief (computer game) Robot Master Manganese Donald Neilson 9/11 conspiracy theories Blood (computer game) Torch Alkane Alabaster Volkert van der Graaf Textile manufacturing

is it too late to replace ignition coil my lawnmower went through a long phase of running while cool then stopping when the engine heats up i didn't know what was going on at the time but went along with it now it won't start at all well it may start for about seconds and then stop i did some research and it seems i probably have a bad ignition coil so i will search for one this week before i do i'm wondering if my mower is even fixable now and if so will i be able replace the coil myself or will i need to go to a repair shop which i hope to avoid it could be the coil magneto if its an older motor it could have points under the flywheel i had a hp tecumseh motored dynamark with points would do exactally that run fine cold then die when hot and not run again till cooled off replacing a magneto is fairly easy points are a bit tougher either way the flywheel cover needs removing the metal shroud on the top of the motor its held on by a few bolts under the cover youll see where the spark plug wire runs into this 'u' shaped device next to the flywheel big round piece with fins cast in it one wire should run to the carb side of motor thats the ground wire to kill the motor if theres more then one wire comming from it and going under the flywheel its possible it has points there are one or two leads that come out by the starter those are for the charging lites system the points are hooked directly to the magneto magnetos usually dont go bad but sometimes they do usually they run around and up a local lawn mower parts place should be able to match up a new one you would need the motor numbers either on the flywheel shroud you removed or on one of the other engine sheilds has a model number serial number and code and engine type briggs tecumseh other write all these down and take to the parts place along with the old magneto points well this is tougher the flywheel will need to be pulled the large nut on the top holding it on will need to be removed a puller will need to be used its like a large bolt in the center to apply pressure then two bolts that run down into prethreaded holes in the top of the flywheel i think you could rent or borrow one from the parts place do not try prying the flywheel off with a prybar or hammering on it its a cast piece and will shatter its a press fit and can only be removed with a proper puller if you do decide to try pulling it off its an experience itll sound exactally like it breaks with a large bang but thats what it sounds like i use a c clamp to keep the motor from turning run it up to the inside bottom of flywheel away from starter teeth and let it rest against engine block there is a small key thet keeps the flywheel from turning this is whats called a 'flywheel key' do not reuse this or youll be replacing it again soon its a one shot deal i suggest when reassembling this to thouroughly clean the crankshaft end inside of flywheel keyway and put a very light amount of neverseize on those surfaces the points will be under a cover around the crank end you should bring those along as well to replace them i highly doubt its the carb or a headgasket if it were those the engine would run rough or not at all from the start kidd  Carburetor Lawn mower Motor oil Bong Drill bit Internal combustion engine Screw Casting Automobile self starter Thermal power station Internal ballistics Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster M16 (rifle) Mattress Diesel engine Handloading Tire Aircraft engine controls Two-stroke cycle Ignition system Tesla coil Torpedo Welding Wire Naval mine Electric motor Lathe Thermostat Glossary of climbing terms Rail terminology Firearm Seismic retrofit Radio controlled airplane Cartridge (firearms) Poker jargon Rigging Indianapolis 500 Textile manufacturing Ford FE engine Machine gun Magnet Lightning Stirling engine Reading spark plugs for racing Loudspeaker Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Rotary engine Steam engine Glossary of firefighting equipment The Dalek Invasion of Earth Brewery Equine conformation Battery electric vehicle Knife STS-61 1957 World Series Hybrid vehicle Solar power Aircraft engine Circuit design Guitar Energy development Woodworking Fluorescent lamp Heinkel He 100 Electrical generator Jump start (vehicle) Mouse (computing) Combine harvester Hard disk Jet engine Diode Bread Connecting rod Nuclear weapon design Toyota Corolla Electrical wiring Terminal ballistics Sailing Hand grenade Electrophysiology Professional wrestling throws Flywheel energy storage Spacecraft propulsion Telephone exchange AMC V8 engine Dodge Neon Heinkel He 112 Windows XP Robot Master Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Bass guitar

what would cause the concrete floor in yr old house to suddenly crack and drop my house is years old and has never had any structural problems the basement is concrete with vinyl tile covering it about months ago the flooring cracked and dropped about to inch in a circle around the i beam about feet away from the beam i noticed today that other areas in the floor are starting to lift and floor has multiple areas of slight elevations beginning the only thing we've changed is cut down a huge tree that was in the backyard way back in april i'm planning to get a structural engineer in but wondered should i get a plumber to look for broken pipes under the house what could cause this to occur any insight would be greatly appreciated well i work in the contruction industry so maybe i can shed a little light here no way it's been caused by settling the house finished settling years ago you didn't tell me how far away that huge tree was away from your foundation but if it was within feet and you remeoved the stump and roots which seems unlikley you have definitley removed mass from underneath your concrete slab i think however more than likely an abundance of moisture has finally accumulated and worked on the basement slab enough to the point where parts of it affected mostly have finally shifted you need to consult a very qualified structural contractor immediatley good luck it's going to be expensive  Basement Seismic retrofit Wood Straw-bale construction Reinforced concrete Air-raid shelter Gramophone record Light-frame construction Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Dundas Square Panama Canal Equine conformation Yosemite National Park Plate tectonics Combine (Half-Life 2) Wood carving Mount St. Helens Stairway Mattress Drag racing Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Leon White Hoover Dam 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens St Albans Cathedral Roof Home repair Casting Anchor Welding Big Dig Xanadu House Elevator Carlsbad Caverns National Park Corrosion Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 24 Hours of Le Mans Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area Masonry The Basement Tapes Kitchen Foundation (architecture) Collapse of the World Trade Center Geodesic dome Aerial (dance move) Pottery Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Space Shuttle program Second Battle of the Atlantic Opportunity rover Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Pachypodium Glossary of wildland fire terms Arlington House Erosion Rathfarnham Colorado Plateau Great Pyramid of Giza Diamond Deforestation Chatsworth House Harley-Davidson McMansion Passive solar Grand Teton National Park Shaggy dog story 2000 Australian Grand Prix Death Valley National Park Baseball Le Corbusier Vegetation Textile manufacturing Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve John Hancock Tower King Khalid International Airport Tenshinhan Climate of the United Kingdom Milton H.

can't turn a c on or off help nothing like having a c problems in the dead of summer i have a samsung aw a air conditioner it's years old and has worked great up until yesterday although the a c came with a remote i never use it i only use the control panel on the a c the a c wouldn't turn on i plugged something else into the outlet to check that the outlet was working fine it was i plugged the a c back in and it beeped i pressed the power button a few times finally it did turn on this morning when i went to shut it off before going to work the power button wouldn't respond i couldn't shut it off i finally shut it off by just unplugging it probably not good for the a c i know when i got home from work today i plugged it back in heard the beep but i couldn't get it going i did find that the only buttons that work are the timer button the button that makes the thermostat go up so i can get the a c to turn on off by using the timer button but i can't get it cooler than degrees i can't believe the entire keypad other than those buttons wore out at the same time like that the air filter is completely clean so it's not that i did take out the remote and found corroded batteries i cleaned it out used some baking soda water put in brand new batteries but the a c didn't respond to the remote at all but that could just be a busted remote i just ordered a new one so any theories on this one couldn't find any troubleshooting guides which addressed this do i just need a new control panel or something or is there something obvious i'm missing here sounds like the control board touchpad is faulty having someone replace could be very expensive doing it yourself can still be expensive life expectancy for an in wall or in window a c unit is years you would be better off purchasing a fedders or ge unit if you choose not to replace the unit with a new one who is to say that the compressor wont give next and those are more expensive than the control board in many cases anyways good luck in what you do if you decide to purchase new home depot or lowes are a nice choice but i would steer closer to a home appliance store personallyl  Embedded system IPod X10 (industry standard) Thermostat Poker jargon Atari 8-bit family Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Carburetor Solar power Mouse (computing) Thermal power station Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Autonomous building Air conditioning Atari ST Windows XP Burglar alarm Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans IBM PC compatible Commodore 64 Jumpstart 3rd Grade Kasparov versus The World Residual-current device Sears Holdings Corporation Modem Battery electric vehicle Windows 2000 Nintendo Entertainment System Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Treehouse of Horror IX E85 Xbox Laptop Diesel engine Virtual memory Personal computer Hearing aid Heinkel He 112 Mattress Japanese toilet Chernobyl accident John Sheridan (Babylon 5) BS 1363 USS S-37 (SS-142) Programmable logic controller 2000 Australian Grand Prix Three-phase electric power Roomba Galileo spacecraft Combine (Half-Life 2) Dance Dance Revolution Universal Serial Bus Remote control Oplan Bojinka 1957 World Series Steven Wright Radio controlled car Battery (electricity) Bicycle lighting Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Strap-on dildo Sega Dreamcast Cray-1 Good Times Apollo 13 Cruising (maritime) Ecco the Dolphin Compiler optimization FoxTrot Apple Computer Xbox 360 Colony in Space Nintendo 64 Full Metal Panic?

what is the anatomy of a bathroom floor with tile i have to repair a hole in a bathroom floor that is upstairs there was some leaking around the tub and the wood is rotted the joists look good but the wood that is laid across the joists need to be replaced there is also a layer of plywood i think i would like to patch the floor and then install tile over the entire bathroom there was carpet in the bathroom that i ripped up are there particular types of wood that i should use for the floor before i put the cement board and the tiles down i don't want to use anything that may rot through over time i want the fix to be permanent and the floor to be level so i can proceed with the tiling thanks in advance for your input as most have said plywood is the best sub floor just remember that all wood products will rot when exposed to water for long enough with that said after you have cut out the old plywood replace it with the same thickness as the existing and use a flooring grade plywood it does not need to be tongue and grove though as you won't be able to match into any existing tongue or grove flooring plywood that is not laid down as tongue and grove the whole floor needs to be blocked at the edges that means you will need to add solid framing lumber on all four sides of the patch securely attach them into the floor joists with nails this is important because by cutting the plywood you will have soft spots at the edges which will cause your new tile to crack now for the water part once you plywood sub floor is sturdy again you need to protect it put down a layer of min building paper over the entire floor hold it down with staples but not too many next put down a cement board tape the joints as stated earlier and on the instructions and finish with the tile and grout do not rely on the tile the grout or any sealer to protect your wood grout is porous water will go right through cement products like cement board are also porous water will be an issue down the road unless you protect the wood good luck  Wood Plywood Basement Upholstery Drill bit Stairway Casting Knife Drywall Roof Woodworking Parquetry Light-frame construction St Albans Cathedral Platform framing Tile Carpet Kitchen Deck (ship) Masonry Boat building Timber framing Tessellation Lumber Dominoes Mattress Welding Architecture of the California missions Electrical wiring Straw-bale construction Tire Hamster Geodesic dome Fire fighting Dam Plane (tool) Oriented strand board Textile manufacturing Terrazzo STS-114 Pavement (material) Portsmouth Block Mills Campfire McMansion Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area Ra (board game) Radio controlled airplane Screw Windows XP Climbing equipment Bassoon Rail tracks Strake Glossary of climbing terms Hemp Compact disc Disc brake Ridge Route Gramophone record Brewery Ceramics Saw Floppy disk Atari 8-bit family Table tennis Naval mine Poker jargon Chatsworth House Wood carving Sento King Khalid International Airport Tongue Bathroom Parachute Collecting fossils Wallpaper group Asbestos Sydney Opera House Elevator Culture of Korea Clinker (boat building) De Lorean DMC-12 Windows 2000 Stucco Anchor Violin Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Jute

home foundation cracks i am interested in buying a home with a few cracks in the foundation how big of an issue is this and how large of a crack is considered serious one particular crack is about a centimeter thick when is the foundation too far gone to be repaired that's a rather large crack and may indicate that the foundation doesn't have any reinforcing steel in the concrete or is built on unstable soil furthermore if the foundation has opened up by a centimeter there should be a corresponding crack in the house if the house is properly anchored to the foundation this is a structural concern that i wouldn't attempt to answer in this forum you should hire a licensed structural engineer to evaluate the situation a few dollars spent today could prevent a big headache in the future  Seismic retrofit Masonry Software engineering Concrete Air-raid shelter Poker jargon Retaining wall Reinforced concrete Space elevator San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Nuclear power World Trade Center Suspension bridge Cryonics Road Straw-bale construction Violin Civil engineering Prestressed concrete Steam (content delivery) Pile Brazing Coalition Provisional Authority St Albans Cathedral Roof Opportunity rover Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Geodesic dome Simone Weil Glossary of climbing terms Welding Copyright infringement of software Terminal ballistics Software patent debate Explosive material Britpop Hoover Dam Katana Federal Communications Commission Password cracking Labor theory of value Millau Viaduct Copy protection Rebar Intellectual property Combine (Half-Life 2) Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Mobile phone radiation and health Blast shelter Microeconomics Software cracking National Kidney Foundation Singapore Containment building Drill bit Campfire Construction Stainless steel Government debt Foundation (architecture) Basement Rail tracks DVD Public domain Pavement (material) Brent Spar CRACKED Limit state design L.

sagging ceiling reinforcing with steel beam i am looking at buying a house while during the orginal inspection i noticed a that the ceiling was saggin in the loungeroom it is an old style colonial house built i imagine around i had a building inspector come in today that said that is could be fixed by running a steel beam along the roof from the front of the house to the back at a degree angle to the rafters and tyeing them up to it has anyone done this before or has advice on this situation do you think it will solve the issue without creating more problems how much do you think this will set me back i would appreciate any and all insights i'm sorry but a building inspector is not qualified or licensed to do structural design although his suggestion might work there are other solutions that may be better also you don't know what size beam to use where to place it and how to tie in the other building members but first you need to determine why the ceiling is sagging is there termite damage was the original design inadequate has the house been abused my recommendation is to hire a licensed structural engineer to examine the house and to make a recommendation he can give you an estimate of the cost to make the repair ultimately if you do decide to buy the house he can prepare a set of drawings for submittal to your local building authority for the necessary permits  Seismic retrofit San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Roof Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Air-raid shelter Software engineering Mattress Autogyro Motion picture rating system Lighting Freedom Tower Basement Electrical wiring Timber framing Light-frame construction Elevator Francis Petre Microeconomics Reinforced concrete Extreme Programming Beam (structure) Buckingham Palace St Albans Cathedral Space Shuttle program Iraq disarmament crisis Termite Public domain Project Orion Architect Limit state design Pretty Good Privacy Slide rule Straw-bale construction Welding Structural engineering Hyatt Regency walkway collapse Wilton House Toronto-Dominion Centre Kitchen Emissions trading Wood Scottish Parliament Building Trademark Copyright Automobile Sydney Opera House Lawyer Retaining wall Screw Bicycle lighting Grand Central Terminal Expert system Alexander Technique Fabrication (metal) Construction Solar power satellite Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Airbus A380 Appeal Copyright law of the United Kingdom Sears Tower Hubble Space Telescope Truss Vickers Valiant Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Parliament of Canada Cascading Style Sheets De Lorean DMC-12 Glossary of firefighting terms John Hancock Tower Product Lifecycle Management Overhead lines Colony in Space Heinkel He 100 Peer review Scientology beliefs and practices Wayne Corporation ISO 9000 Tire M16 (rifle) Space elevator Oscilloscope Helicopter Pilot certification in the United States Sudoku Boat building RX-78 mobile suit series Tudorbethan architecture Bus models used in New York City Transit Fusion power Senate Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq Piano Common Fisheries Policy Capitalism Education in England Speed limit Wood carving Santos-Dumont 14-bis Equine conformation

wich is better in the long run standard a c furnace or hybrid a c heat pump furnace either way natural gas the later type of system you're talking about is called dual fuel what that means is there isn't a difference in the summer because most a c or heat pump systems in the us anyway run only on electricity a heat pump works like a standard ac in the summer the difference is in the winter in heating mode in winter the unit runs as a heat pump until the temperature outside drops to the point where the continuing to operate in heat pump is no longer economically advantageous the system then switches to the gas furnace operation because below a certain temperature it varies based on location and this temperature point called an economic balance point can be set for each individual system when it is installed at the home it is no longer economically feasible to run in heat pump mode if by better you mean more economical to operate generally dual fuel systems are better but they are also more costly in the beginning by the way the first poster doesn't have a clue what he's talking about heat pumps definitely do have freon freon is a trade name for dupont refrigerants there are other names that is how they transfer heat from a warm location to a cooler location in the winter they pick up heat from the outside and transfer it into the house in the summer it works in the opposite if you're interested in more details look up refrigerant cycle on the internet  Air conditioning Solar power Refrigerator Motor oil Fossil fuel power plant Haloalkane Thermal power station Furnace E85 Thermostat Carburetor Autonomous building Hydrogen economy Heat Temperature Renewable energy Power station Phase change heat pump Steam engine Natural gas Internal combustion engine Hybrid vehicle Energy development Nuclear power Cray-1 Gas absorption refrigerator Kitchen Jet engine Nuclear reactor Mitigation of global warming Carbon dioxide Spacecraft propulsion Transformer Alcohol fuel Explosive material Gas compressor HVAC Electrical wiring Petroleum Ceramics Three-phase electric power Alternative fuel Hydropower Gas turbine Electric arc furnace Central processing unit Central heating Incineration Turbojet Wind turbine Coal Entropy RuneScape Mini-Games Turbocharger Biodiesel Oxygen sensor Heinkel He 100 Water (molecule) Geothermal exchange heat pump STS-62 Basement Locomotive Heat engine Gas metal arc welding Vacuum Wind power Helium Deep lake water cooling Hydraulic machinery Two-stroke cycle Phase (matter) Toyota Prius Global climate model Adiabatic process Cogeneration Diesel engine Heat pump Gasoline Town gas Fuel cell Future energy development Ammonia Brewery Diode Thermocouple Pebble bed reactor Fusion power Peltier-Seebeck effect Global warming Nuclear thermal rocket

why does my kitchen faucet leak while the washing machine is running almost every time the washing machine is running or even the shower the kitchen sink leaks not a small leak but about the amount of water comes out compared to on moderately it also makes a very loud vibration noise for a few minutes and then stops however the faucet continues to leak i've seen some really odd things happen with worn out single control faucets like cross flow between the cold and hot lines but never anything quite this bizzarre if it is a single control faucet perhaps the capsule inside the faucet depends on adequate pressure to keep it sealed and when other faucets or the washer is running there's not enough pressure a simple test might be to run the hot water in this faucet until it gets hot then start up the washing machine or the shower and feel the supply tubes on this faucet if there is cross flow the hot water tube may become cold or the cold water tube may become hot depeding on which way the pressure differential occurs in a good faucet that's turned off the hot side should stay hot and the cold side should stay cold beyond that call ghostbusters  Tap (valve) Sento Plumbing fixture Siphon Tire Thermal power station Spark plug Hydraulic machinery Japanese toilet Welding Tap water Rebreather Diving regulator Drowning Sauna Stirling engine Pulse jet engine Cruising (maritime) Internal ballistics Casting Fossil fuel power plant Bong Sailing Carbon dioxide Transformer Flush toilet Electrophysiology Vacuum Compiler optimization Electric motor Vacuum tube Diode E85 Urinary incontinence Dishwasher Internal combustion engine Heat Bidet Mercury Atlas 6 Spacecraft propulsion Traumatic brain injury Customs and etiquette of Japan Soldering Thermostat Jet engine Home repair Digital circuit Transistor Billboard Hot 100 Pebble bed reactor Energy development Motor oil Menstrual cup Seismic retrofit Scuba set Washing machine Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Mercury 4 Kidney Brewery CPU design Microphone Portable stove Fuzzy logic Rail tracks SR-71 Blackbird Reading spark plugs for racing Cray-1 Fire fighting Solar power Tattoo Fecal incontinence Dialysis Submarine Hard water Freedom 7 USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Residual-current device USS Tunny (SS-282) Three Mile Island Ocean thermal energy conversion Nuclear meltdown Cookware and bakeware Iowa class battleship Washroom Space shuttle main engine Axial compressor Coffee Naval mine Swimming

how is it possible for a shower drain to back up and flow out of a kitchen faucet i'm in a nd story apartment in a story building i cleaned my shower with comet one night the next morning i go to the kitchen sink and when i turned it on there was a pause like air in the lines and then the greenish water that went down my shower drain the night before came spitting out i understand that many sinks tubs all drain to the same place poor ventilation can cause a back up but my question is how can the shower drain possibly be linked to the incoming water supply isn't the incoming water outgoing waste water completely two different systems that are not ever linked are you absolutely positive it was the same water if someone was working on the pipes or water pressure was lost in the night there would be air in the lines and usually a lot of crud that has settled in the water lines will blow out when it's first turned on it can look pretty nasty if you think the drain water line cross connection is real first try to re create the incident run some water with food coloring or something in it down the shower drain and see if it appears at the sink ther next morning i think it was just some kind of wierd coincidence even if somebody through igrorance or on purpose connected your water lines with your drain lines water would just go directly from the water lines down the drain lines you'd hear it running the two systems are totally different the waterlines are under pressure the drain lines run by gravity and have vents to avoid pressure buildup if the problem continues have the landlord get somebody to look at it  Domestic water system Siphon Kitchen Tap (valve) Coriolis effect Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Sewage treatment Autonomous building Furnace Dialysis Jet engine Thermostat USS Seadragon (SS-194) Dymaxion house Rebreather Solar power Dam Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Carburetor Energy development Cruising (maritime) Sento Japanese toilet Sewer Irrigation Scuba set Glossary of firefighting equipment Water supply Fire hydrant Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Social rule Central heating Diver rescue Air conditioning Neutrino USS Tang (SS-306) Flush toilet Canal lock Customs and etiquette of Japan Dishwashing USS Waters (DD-115) Diving regulator USS Tunny (SS-282) Motor oil Renewable energy Zuiderzee Works Glossary of firefighting terms Operation Market Garden Ship Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Shaggy dog story Basement Water tower Second Battle of the Atlantic Septic tank Dishwasher Sauna Dairy Circulatory system USS Whale (SS-239) Modem Erie Canal Seismic retrofit Lake Welding Swimming pool Bidet Sailing Two-stroke cycle Derbyshire lead mining history 2003 North America blackout Soldering Geography of Africa Final Fantasy magic Moon Air pollution Blood pressure Intracranial pressure Urinal Brewery Dog agility TGV USS Wahoo (SS-238) Novelty (locomotive) Naval mine Hydraulic ram Battery (electricity) Swimming Water resources 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Urinary incontinence Progressive tax Hydropower Fluid pressure

how long do you run your pool filter daily i just got a inground x and know nothing about pools for the basics you should run the filter for hours a day the best thing to do is to go to your local pool supply store and give them the dimensions of the pool and they will tell you what to do be careful not to buy stuff you don t really need they will offer you probably many things that re not necessary and are more like a luxury the main thing is to run the filter daily use chlorine weekly scrub and vacuum at least once a week and keep the ph levels balanced you can buy self test kit or you can just take a sample of the water to the store they usually gives you a small container and then you write your number and name and they will keep your info in their systems so they know the size of the pool and how much chemicals you have to use to balance the ph you also need to shock the pool and should keep the calcium levels good the shock is to help the chlorine the calcium is to help maintain the walls and floor again the local store will help you with all that don t forget if you leave the pool unattended and you don t have the necessary equipment to run everything automatically it will turn green in no time it takes only to hours to go from clear to a swamp good luck  Swimming pool Thermal power station Carburetor Chlorine Water purification Sewage treatment Solar power Hard disk Brewery Hydrochloric acid Carbon dioxide Customs and etiquette of Japan Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Marine aquarium Windows 2000 Syphon Filter Fountain Apollo Command/Service Module Energy development Neopets Air conditioning Dialysis Japanese tea ceremony Soil pH Dairy Vacuum cleaner Ozone depletion Action potential Explosive material Survival skills Bristol Grammar School Supply and demand $ale of the Century Acne Nuclear reactor Sodium hypochlorite Organic food Extreme Programming Marathon (sport) Sea-Monkey Hybrid vehicle Ozone Community emergency response team Bong Ozone hole William Poole Kidney Menstrual cycle Swimming Pebble bed reactor UK Singles Chart Sento First aid Disinfection Use of poison gas in World War I Dundas Square Insulin Cannabis cultivation The Chemical Brothers Pools of Darkness John McDouall Stuart Sterilization (microbiology) Welding Craps Hardware random number generator Electrophysiology Surveillance Storyteller System Fancy rat Tank Tag Digital photography Mineral Drip irrigation Glossary of firefighting equipment Elevator MMORPG Stopping e-mail abuse Sauna Ultraviolet Textile manufacturing STS-50 Imperial stormtrooper Hypoglycemia Haloalkane Biodiesel The Ark in Space Human skin color RuneScape locations Hamster NTFS Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Octopus card Cell (biology) Water Sears Holdings Corporation Siphon Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Long-term potentiation

how to remove calcium build up from the inside of my hot tub spa i have tried everything i can think of it cannot be anything that will scratch the surface it may be too late for the mytee mitt but if you haven't tried one then that might do it it's made for pools and spas i've not had good luck with clr on thicker build ups but it is great on the typical mineral deposits on glassware sinks toilets tubs etc definitely worth a try there is a white pumice stone like block that i get at walmart in the cleaning products area that i have used to remove mineral and scum buildup on fiberglass tubs try one of those and see if it works but you will probably need several for the whole hot tub if you are careful then you may want to start by using a single edge razor blade scraper to scrape off the thickest of the mineral buildup  Knife Dishwasher Swimming pool Hard water Drill bit Pottery Dishwashing Sento Soap Motor oil Hot tub 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Textile manufacturing Brewery Woodworking Diamond Shaving Gay bathhouse Hot spring Eifel Aqueduct Top-bar hive Tuff Geology of the Moon Hand scraper Desert Glossary of wildland fire terms Gilding Customs and etiquette of Japan Opportunity rover Mount Mazama Olduwan Genericized trademark Onsen Diamond simulant Sauna Mineral Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Kenny McCormick Residual-current device Fiberglass Coriolis effect Menstrual cup Weathering Geyser Surface mining Long Valley Caldera Tooth Aluminium Tooth enamel Eolian Sea ice Cubic zirconia Card scraper Spark plug Razor Plumbing fixture Radio controlled airplane Marble sculpture Asbestos Mineral County, West Virginia Bulldozer Limestone Water (molecule) Mount St. Helens Halitosis Internal ballistics Dymaxion house Bathing Goaltender Hard disk Masonry Printmaking Table saw Milk Oceanic trench Crater Lake National Park Toilet paper Transformer Caliche Sewage treatment Bone Gramophone record Obsidian Diseases of the honeybee Shampoo Ammolite Sulfuric acid Mattress Fecal incontinence Atlantic Ocean Derbyshire lead mining history Hot rod Carnivorous plant Wal-Mart Typewriter Red Hot Chili Peppers

my shower floods when i run the kitchen disposal i can't afford a plumber right now so i need to figure out how to stop my shower from flooding when i run the disposal in order for it to do this the shower must be pretty close to the disposal you have a clogged line after the point where the two drain pipes come together since the shower is the lowest point in the system for something to come out it does so there the clog is probably not bad enough to hold up the shower drain but if you turned on all your faucets at once you would see the shower drain slow then start filling to cure this get a drain opener that is good for grease since that is the most likely culprit comming from the kitchen  Plumbing fixture Siphon Drain cleaner Septic tank Sewage treatment Domestic water system Garbage disposal Sento Thermal power station Drainage Cruising (maritime) Kitchen Hebden Bridge Autonomous building Home repair Dairy Carburetor Final Fantasy magic Tap (valve) Plastic Bong Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Inkjet printer Hard water Plastic bag Ship Water purification Urinary incontinence Sewer Meteor shower Canal lock 2005 Maharashtra floods Haloalkane Motor oil Geography of India Toilet paper Glossary of partner dance terms C__ile Ferate Rom__ne Ra (board game) Social rule Flush toilet Jam (TV series) Team Fortress Classic Washroom Basement Severe weather terminology (United States) Climate of the United Kingdom Poker jargon Central heating Japanese toilet Geography of Africa Australian rules football Dam Zuiderzee Works Mount Pinatubo Baby bottle Billiards Stream Protoss Prisons in the United States Tap water Charles Graner Flood geology Stove Heinkel He 100 Space shuttle main engine Dundas Square Panama Canal Locks Futurama (TV series - season 4) Refrigerator 2004 Atlantic hurricane season 2003 United States Grand Prix Minako Aino Kandersteg International Scout Centre Wario Trapped in the Closet RuneScape Mini-Games National Kidney Foundation Singapore The Caves of Androzani Muhammad Ahmad Sears Holdings Corporation Mach kernel Progressive tax Fast bowling Colony in Space Wood carving Pastry bag Circulatory system Kasparov versus The World Sauna Missouri River Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Ammunition MOSFET 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Family from One End Street Otitis externa Stopping e-mail abuse Geography of Germany

what do cobwebs have to do with radon or any other issue that would make a home more desirable a friend of mine sold their house in an area where i know they got a very low and unfair price for it the realtor putting it on the market insisted they not wipe away the cobwebs in the basement because she said it proves there is not a radon problem maybe the realtor thought the cobwebs show that there is ventilation in the basement which would vent radon gas buildup unfortunately that would also show that the basement is drafty which would be a negative mark against the house i suppose they could also have thought the spiders were like the canaries used in mines to be the first indication of the presence of deadly gases but that sounds kind of stupid since the spiders could probably survive a nuclear blast like roaches so a little radon isn't going to faze them it sounds like your friends needed another realtor it would have been better for them to have removed the cobwebs so the place looked clean and had radon testing performed to prove there was not a radon problem radon testing is an inexpensive test s h that homeowners can do themselve or they could call in a home inspector to do it if they want more credible result  Radon Uranium Nuclear power Lung cancer Real estate broker Carbon dioxide Welding Environmental concerns with electricity generation M16 (rifle) Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Web crawler Ionizing radiation Lebesgue integration Insurance Natural gas Blood (computer game) AMD Thorium The Time Machine Explosive material Background radiation Land mine Autonomous building Hydrogen peroxide Heinkel He 100 Audiophile Mortgage Lunar Prospector Nuclear reactor Home repair Terran (StarCraft) Year of the Spider Search engine optimization Theory of conduct HIV test Fred A.

my windowe mount air conditioner spits out water and makes a flapping noise after it's been on awhile ideas your a c is full of water and the outside drain hole must be cleaned with all the rain humidity we have been experiencing your a c has not had time to drain it may be that the drain hole is dirty or plugged with debris the water that the a c takes out of the house must be drained or evaporated outside in some fashion most of the water will drain automatically but if you are getting more water than the drain can handle your fan will touch the water and make the flapping noise and send in bits of mist into the inside of the room the newer models of a c's are using some of the water from evaporation to cool the a c unit on the outside so the drain does not eliminate all of the water as it would in an older model the drain hole is smaller and can become clogged look around the outside of your unit and find the drain hole take something that will fit inside the hole and gently work the hole to see if you can get whatever it is that is blocking the area out of the hole if you can get the unit to drain wait until all the water is drained out and then take a water hose and squirt into the unit and clean out the debris you will see through the fins and be able to see if you need to get out larger leaves or limbs from inside the unit cage this clean up should be done a couple of times a year  Thermal power station Glossary of firefighting equipment Air conditioning Bong Black hole M16 (rifle) Swamp cooler Carburetor Basement Hard disk Home repair Tire Houseplant Irrigation Heinkel He 100 Domestic water system Frogman Piccolo Junior Saga Climate of the United Kingdom Ozone depletion RISC Jet engine Customs and etiquette of Japan Japanese toilet Sento First aid Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Toilet Diving regulator Spark plug Heat exchanger Automobile emissions control Ozone hole Fire fighting Toilet humour Vacuum cleaner Whitewater Water Diving suit Transformer Water vapor Electrophysiology Opportunity rover Kitchen Full Metal Panic?

low water pressure in the home very odd i have replaced all plumbing in the house with pex including the shutoff valve the incoming line from the meter is inch copper city says its reading psi at the meter can the meter be bad restricting flow so that leaves it the line between the house and the meter which is a quarter mile long i have another house that probable has the pipe in the same trench and its pressure is working fine no leaks underground is there a way to test the line and can a copper line be full of deposits the most obvious thing would be a pressure regulator downstream of the meter either at the meter itself or at the house but i assume you've already checked this if there's no pressure regulator or you've verified the pressure downstream of it i'd suggest fitting a hose faucet before the main shutoff valve so you can test the pressure before it goes into the house system if you're seeing the drop before the house shutoff valve i'd then fit a valve out at the meter to verify you're really get psi before the run up to the house if that checks out i'd suspect a leak but there's certainly something going on between the meter and the house edit this is based on the assumption that you actually have a pressure drop at the house and not just low flow if you did a homerun install the shouldn't be an issue maybe to a tub shower but will suffice and if you've got low flow faucets and shower heads is more than enough also you mentioned that you started the pex before the main house shutoff valve or at least that's what i think you meant with pex including the shutoff valve this is all inside right pex can not be installed anywhere with direct uv exposure the mfg's specify a maximum tolerance of days exposure to sunlight during distrubution and installation beyond that it goes brittle and will quickly fail  Flush toilet Diving regulator Hydraulic machinery Siphon Carburetor Glossary of firefighting equipment Irrigation Rebreather Thermal power station Dialysis Diving cylinder Tap (valve) Fuel injection Plumbing fixture Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Water supply Domestic water system Containment building Panama Canal Tire Vacuum Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Scuba set Spark plug Manifold vacuum Space shuttle main engine Fire fighting Renewable energy Thermostat Air brake (rail) Oxyacetylene Home repair Novelty (locomotive) Solar cell Three Mile Island Welding Electrophysiology Glacier Opportunity rover Pulse jet engine Solar power Dishwasher Jet engine Coriolis effect Circuit breaker Energy development Apollo Command/Service Module Furnace Hydraulic ram Broadband Internet access Trombone Dam Nuclear power Sleeve valve Dodge Neon Space Shuttle external tank Residual-current device Bell's theorem Diode Fire hydrant Electricity meter Fire extinguisher Soldering Fuse (electrical) Dead Sea Cartridge (firearms) Vacuum tube STS-61 Heat Sento Electrical wiring High-voltage direct current Mobile phone radiation and health Plastic Poker jargon Fluorescent lamp Drill bit Many-worlds interpretation Casting Airbus A380 Dundas Square Oceanic trench Gold standard Debugging Universal Serial Bus Glossary of wildland fire terms Atrial septal defect

who's at fault me or my plumber i had a leak in a pipe in my front yard my plumber said it was a leak in the pipe that runs from the main valve at the perimeter of my house to my house he said because of the concrete and landscaping rather than fix the actual leak it would be easier to install a new pipe from my house to the main valve essentially bypassing the original leak that sounded reasonable so i said ok he did the work now there is no water going to the sprinkler system in my back yard the new pipe in the front yard made it so no water flows to the back yard my plumber says you never told me you had sprinklers in the back yard i feel like he is the professional and should know that there may be other pipes involved i have no idea how the piping system under my house works or is laid out who is right a homeowner is not responsible for knowing how his plumbing is connected especially underground the plumber is a professional and should have considered the possibility and investigated before proceeding with a recommendation underground connections are common the plumber as any profession should make his work good even if he has to eat his own mistakes you could be a gentleman by understand that it was an honest mistake and help him defray the cost http brassmein com http g proboards com  Irrigation Siphon Plame affair Seismic retrofit Kitchen Hydraulic machinery Fire Sprinkler Domestic water system Flush toilet White House Plumbers Debugging Home repair Fire hydrant Glossary of firefighting terms Glossary of firefighting equipment Watergate scandal Basement Rail terminology Burglar alarm Water supply Carburetor Jean Charles de Menezes Rebreather Locomotive National Kidney Foundation Singapore Plumbing fixture Two-stroke cycle Autonomous building Containment building Water hammer Sewer Software bug Anchor Scientific method Diving regulator Dundas Square Turbocharger Tire Thermostat HyperText Transfer Protocol Electrical wiring High-voltage direct current Residual-current device Ethics Vacuum tube Geodesic dome Renewable energy Solar power Common Unix Printing System Water supply network Fire alarm control panel William Murdoch Soldering Steam (content delivery) Energy development Novelty (locomotive) Hydropower Insurance Computer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Coronary circulation Three Mile Island Roof and tunnel hacking Pipe organ Construction Extreme Programming International Phonetic Alphabet Urinal Collapse of the World Trade Center Mach kernel Cray-1 Space shuttle main engine Sydney Riot of 1879 Spark plug Supercharger Heat Home improvement Chatsworth House Dalek (Doctor Who episode) Scientology beliefs and practices Scuba set Hydraulic ram Sleeve valve Ocean thermal energy conversion Big Dig Logic Property (ownership right) Glossary of American football Dodge Neon Newcomen steam engine Marching band Sailing Web server Japanese toilet Skateboarding trick ROF Bishopton Jet engine Air brake (rail) Windows Vista

is it better to leave an immersion heater on or use it only when needed we have a heater for hot water do we use more electricity by letting it top up the heat or by switching off and switching on each morning do as anthony said if you leave it on you will have a constant supply of hot water the thermostat will then decide when to turn the electric on and off usually about mins every hours if you switch on only when you need water you will have to heat from cold which takes about to hours each time also turn thermostat down about ten degrees to save a small amount of money  Thermostat Apollo 13 Heat Solar power HVAC Refrigerator Autonomous building Ironing Fossil fuel power plant Water heater Energy development Solar panel Process control Slow cooker Bi-metal Samovar Hot air balloon Diesel engine Thermal power station Energy Coffee Carburetor Renewable energy Transformer Welding Electricity meter Spacecraft propulsion Gas metal arc welding Hysteresis Temperature Peltier-Seebeck effect Radiator Explosive material Daylight saving time Environmental concerns with electricity generation Aquarium Carbon dioxide Incandescent light bulb Fire fighting Oscilloscope Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Wind power Rail terminology Vacuum tube Sauna Fusion power Stove Cold fusion Gas absorption refrigerator Scuba set Alcohol fuel Water Steam engine Elevator Dialysis Thermocouple Torpedo Cruising (maritime) Green-Kubo relations Electronic amplifier Deep lake water cooling Venus Hydropower Electric motor Washing machine Personal rapid transit Heat capacity Thermistor Mercury Atlas 6 Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Apollo Command/Service Module Town gas Rice cooker CPU design Waterbed Transistor Water (molecule) Professional wrestling slang Bathing Heating element Plasma (physics) Embedded system Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Ocean thermal energy conversion Axial compressor Bread Three-phase electric power Air conditioning Phase change heat pump Equation of time Thermoregulation Internal combustion engine Central processing unit Water supply Fuel cell Marine aquarium Negative feedback Wire wrap

light turns off while switch in on position when i turn a light switch on the light will sometimes not always turn off and occasionally back on by itself is this caused by a short please reply with more than call an electrician or if you have electrical experience knowledge thanks in advance there isn't just one bulb it's a chandelier with five or six bulbs so i doubt its a loose bulb good thinking though mostly likely problem is the switch either bad contacts in the switch itself or my bet it was wired backstab fashion the wires are inserted into holes in the back of the switch receptacle and the spring is failing making for an intermittent connection next most likely problem is a loose wirenutted connection at the fixture either where the fixture connects to the in wall wiring most likely or in the fixture itself switches are cheap under a dollar the first thing i'd do is replace the switch if that doesn't fix it it check the connections where the fixture connects to the house wiring and finally check the connections in the fixture itself as others have said turn off the breaker before attempting any service you've got a bit of an akward situation because you can't really on the light going out show whether the breaker is on or off pick up proximity voltage detector at the hardware store about this is a plastic device about the size of marker and it flashes and buzzes when held near an energized wire this will allow you to confirm that the power is truely off to the circuit before working on it  Switch Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Fluorescent lamp Stage lighting Incandescent light bulb Diode Relay Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Vacuum tube Electric motor BS 1363 Light-emitting diode Residual-current device Light switch Circuit breaker Fuse (electrical) Transformer Distribution board Electrical wiring (UK) Poker jargon Thermostat X10 (industry standard) Overhead lines Transistor Circuit design Lighting Universal Serial Bus Central processing unit Battery (electricity) Apollo Guidance Computer Gas metal arc welding National Electrical Code (US) Digital circuit Ethernet Enigma machine Solar cell Logic gate Telephone tapping Spark gap Dimmer Printed circuit board Street light Capacitor Electrical wiring Electrician X-ray Bicycle lighting Lineman (occupation) Three-phase electric power Screw Ultraviolet Electrophysiology Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Hall effect George Westinghouse Loudspeaker MOSFET Potentiometer Welding Burglar alarm Tesla coil Drill bit Modem Electronic amplifier Fire alarm control panel High-voltage hazards Traffic light Embedded system Electrical element Causality Strap-on dildo Computer Resistor Compact fluorescent lamp IPod Digital Seismic retrofit Jack plug Rotor machine 2003 North America blackout Electricity Programmable logic controller High-voltage direct current Railway signal Windows XP Programmable logic device Pinball Ring circuit Alternating current Crossbar switch

i bought a house this year that has a large well under the back patio concrete what are some ideas what to do with this i have little experience on these things should the well be filled in or remove the stone that surrounds it the stones wouldn't really hurt anything in the ground would they what would be the cheapest option the well doesn't have any function it looks very very old first the stones will not hurt anything if filled in except may settle and you will have to add more the next part is this may be a sistern they were used to store rain water is any downspouts connected i have two sisterns and they are great for watering garden and yard you may have municpial water and it cost you or have a draught then you will wish you kept the well or sistern i would not worry about it just keep a good cover on so knowbody gets hurt then after a period of time see if you still don't need it you can ask question in your neighborhood if anybody has run short on water history if filling add big and small gravel so it settles tightly  Basement Lechaina Hash table Mach kernel Extreme Programming Diving Piccolo Junior Saga Seismic retrofit Poker jargon Urinary incontinence Airport Concrete Internal ballistics Gravel Elis Prefecture CPU cache Dundas Square Kitchen Theory of conduct Kerikeri Self Portrait Drainage Rathfarnham Japanese tea ceremony Thermal power station Hydroponics Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Alhambra Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Palace of Westminster Big Dig Hydropower Irrigation Roman road Pittsburgh Steelers Bratislava Castle Deflation (economics) Stonehenge Novelty (locomotive) Cruising (maritime) Sewage treatment Oscilloscope Capernaum Retaining wall 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Campfire Database management system Canal lock Blood on the Tracks Go (board game) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Erie Canal Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Leaf Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Desert Electrophysiology Anchor Origin belief Textile manufacturing Bart Sells His Soul Florida Keys Affton, Missouri Autonomous building Humphrey Bogart 1957 World Series XML Toronto Subway and RT The nature of God in Western theology Windows XP Panama Canal Locks Economics Sento Drill bit Nuclear power Christiansborg Palace Drama Prefecture Mississippi John Hurt Solar cell Philosophical skepticism Target Corporation Laserdisc Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory Armored Core MAME Aerial (dance move) Microeconomics Floppy disk Anarchism and society Knife West Side Highway Philosophy of language Go strategy and tactics RuneScape Mini-Games Shot of Love Hangi Derbyshire lead mining history Animal Crossing Wind turbine

what size of ac needed sq ft home and what is the difference between electric strip heat and a heat pump please probably ton if you buy a heat pump system it will include the outdoor compressor unit and the indoor air handler fan the outdoor compressor acts as both an ac and a heater a heat pump is simply an ac that has a reverse cycle however if you live in a climate that has very cold winters i would not recommend a heat pump at certain low temperatures a heat pump can not generate enough heat to heat your home properly the indoor air handler has electric heat strips for backup these are very very inefficient and use a huge amount of electricity if you live in say pensacola fl a heat pump would be perfect for you but if your winters are cold youshould go with a natural gas furnace for your heat the gas furnace and fan for the ac are both contained in the same unit  Thermostat Air conditioning Ocean thermal energy conversion Solar power Jet engine Fossil fuel power plant HVAC Diesel engine Thermal power station Gas compressor Autonomous building Phase change heat pump Furnace Axial compressor Motor oil Stirling engine Refrigerator Temperature Power station Turbocharger Gas turbine Supercharger Carbon dioxide Steam engine Explosive material Heat Renewable energy Turbojet Heat pump Transformer Energy development E85 Entropy Nuclear power Carburetor Gas absorption refrigerator Geothermal exchange heat pump Alcohol fuel Internal combustion engine Pebble bed reactor Turbofan Portable stove Aquarium Water (molecule) Heat engine Central heating Natural gas Coal Incineration Welding Open hearth furnace Peltier-Seebeck effect Wind power Basement Three-phase electric power Vacuum Thermocouple Lighting Gasoline Swimming pool Cogeneration Water vapor Vacuum tube Global climate model SABRE Town gas Combined cycle Apollo 13 Plasma (physics) Hydrogen Three Mile Island Phase (matter) Hydropower Powder metallurgy Deep lake water cooling Sewage treatment Wood fuel Ford Ranger EV Fan (implement) Two-stroke cycle Gas metal arc welding Space manufacturing Bleed air Fusion power Water Radon Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Steam locomotive nomenclature Electric arc furnace Environmental concerns with electricity generation Enriched uranium Energy Brayton cycle SR-71 Blackbird Soldering Refrigeration

craftsman small engine valves do not open and close theres also a clicking sound when you spin the engine and no compression and if you spin the engine backwards valves open and close if youre proficient at repairing your lawntractor id check a few things before throwing in the towel and taking it to a repair shop or cheeper getting another motor remove the sparkplug turn the motor over by hand use a screwdriver to see if the piston is moving back and forth if it does it should be okay to continue if it doesnt move then something broke inside the motor replacement of motor would be best option when turning the motor by hand w o the sparkplug in some air should 'puff' out at you if it does then theres compression the clicking noise could be from a magnet inside the flywheel comming off ive had that happen it could be possible the flywheel key broke and spun the motor out of timing only way to check that is to remove the flywheel cover metal shroud over top of motor flywheel is large round part with fins cast in it remove the large nut holding it on and look for the small keyway one in the flywheel one in the crank end a small metal key designed to break in a sudden motor stop situation motor is suddenly stopped to keep from internal damage key snaps and prevents it they should be lined up ive had a key snap and spin the flywheel degrees out of time if its broke then the flywheel needs to be removed and new key installed one time use availible at any tractor parts store tractor supply a special puller is needed to remove the flywheel as its a press fit do not pry or hammer on flywheel it will break as its only cast iron the magnet inside the flywheel is for the charging lite system usually when the magnets come loose it tears up the stator or in automotive terms the alternator the flywheel and stator are actually a large alternator if thats the case a new flywheel and stator are needed if both are damaged they can be bypassed youd just have to manually charge the battery is all try checking these first then make a judgement from there sometimes its easier just replacing the motor ive had good luck buying used tractors with bad transmissions but good motors cheep brand new motors run around if theres internal damage then the motor change is more then likely when one lets loose it rips alot of stuff up inside making it useless hope this helps kidd  Spark plug Electric motor Internal combustion engine Tire Two-stroke cycle Axial compressor Gas compressor IPod Thermal power station Screw Hard disk Manual transmission Energy development Toyota Prius Motor oil Diesel engine Wind turbine Floppy disk Stirling engine Hybrid vehicle Carburetor Lawn mower Motorcycle Steam engine Alternator Mouse (computing) BMW M5 Tank Hydraulic machinery Poker jargon Volleyball Dodge Neon Gramophone record Vacuum tube Magnet Second Battle of the Atlantic Professional wrestling holds Jet engine Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Locomotive Glossary of firefighting equipment Turbocharger Four-stroke cycle USS Tunny (SS-282) Handloading Naval mine Casting Elevator Rail terminology Battery electric vehicle Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Rotary engine E85 Electrical generator Cheating in Counter-Strike Automatic transmission Horsepower Table saw Gas turbine Solar power Knife Glossary of American football Radio controlled car M16 (rifle) Sleeve valve Aerial (dance move) Torpedo STS-61 Harley-Davidson Airsoft Swingout Engine balance GunZ The Duel Diving regulator Ford Mustang Violin Fuel cell Diode Drill bit Model aircraft Seismic retrofit Textile manufacturing Chevrolet Corvair engine Uninterruptible power supply De Lorean DMC-12 Rebreather Continuously variable transmission Toyota MR2 Welding Combine harvester Circuit breaker Automobile

why won't my toilet cistern refill with water after flushing it sounds like the ball valve is stuck in the closed position it is possible to repair a ball valve if you know what you are doing but to be honest the cost of a new one makes it not worth the effort if you decide to replace it consider spending a bit more money and replace it with a torbeck valve lot more efficient and quieter in operation before going to buy check to see if it is a side entry or bottom entry valve you will need to buy the right one the terms refer to where the valve connection comes out of the cistern for the water pipe to connect to  Flush toilet Steam engine Two-stroke cycle Urinal Carburetor Autonomous building Rebreather Poker jargon Siphon Tire Heart valve Diving regulator Trombone Plumbing fixture Irrigation Brewery Hydraulic machinery Computer Hydraulic ram CPU cache Turbocharger Four-stroke cycle Thermal power station Timing belt Toilet Glossary of American football Heart Three Mile Island Vacuum tube Canal lock Mad Money Domestic water system Japanese toilet Space shuttle main engine Poppet valve Seismic retrofit Automatic transmission Counter-Strike Thermostat High-voltage direct current Diving suit Snooker Chevrolet Corvair engine Tap (valve) VTEC Fuel injection Toilet paper William Murdoch Glossary of firefighting equipment Novelty (locomotive) Heart sounds Diving cylinder Feedback Fire hydrant Dodge Neon Programmable logic controller Rail terminology Steam (content delivery) Cheating in Counter-Strike Sleeve valve Make money fast Douglas DC-8 Cardiac cycle Transistor Bagpipes Billiards Energy development Uilleann pipes Newcomen steam engine Pinball Furnace Variable valve timing Coffee Microeconomics Home repair Camshaft Cruising (maritime) PID controller Port Authority Trans-Hudson Motorcycle World Series Baseball Stars USS S-5 (SS-110) Operation Petticoat Electronic amplifier Washroom Manifold vacuum Trumpet Delta Air Lines Electrophysiology Bunsen burner Sewer Aortic valve Bong Violin Hamster Canoe Air brake (rail) Modern naval tactics

why do water heaters drain my water heater is draining water nightly it seems to occur more frequently and is louder than normal could it be that it is the summer time and i am not using as much hot water as i would in the winter it is a gas not electric water heater i read that the heater does it if the water gets too hot how can i tell that the reason it is draining is ok or when should i start to worry thanks draining water do you mean it is coming from the pop off valve you have a problem either you temperature setting is way too high or you have a bad pop off valve this is the little brass thing with a handle on the side at the top of your heater first turn down the temp if it is still draining replace the pop off  Thermal power station Thermostat Furnace Apollo 13 Vacuum tube Water heater Carburetor Fossil fuel power plant Samovar Steam engine Diesel engine Basement Siphon Autonomous building Process control Refrigerator Internal combustion engine Solar power Town gas Tap (valve) Sauna Spark plug Space shuttle main engine Transistor Three Mile Island Dodge Neon Novelty (locomotive) Panama Canal Locks Sento Home repair PID controller Sleeve valve Dialysis Chevrolet Corvair Bi-metal HVAC Billboard Hot 100 Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Hot air balloon Diving regulator Rebreather Motor oil Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Tire Chevrolet Corvair engine Thermocouple Renewable energy E85 Ammonia Cruising (maritime) Two-stroke cycle Phase change heat pump Water (molecule) Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Fire hydrant Fire fighting Fuel cell Liquid breathing Rail terminology Canal lock Heart Electricity meter Customs and etiquette of Japan Ford Ranger EV Slow cooker Silicon Welding Pebble bed reactor STS-62 Fire extinguisher Torpedo Heat Four-stroke cycle Bass guitar Turbocharger Climate of the United Kingdom Stirling engine Air conditioning MOSFET Domestic water system Ozone depletion Washing machine Sea ice Drag racing Carbon dioxide Incandescent light bulb Geography of Bolivia Pinball Glossary of firefighting equipment Plumbing fixture Steam locomotive nomenclature Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Gas tungsten arc welding Gas compressor Hydraulic machinery Cold fusion

what should i do if a voltage detector goes off when i hold it about inches above the stove top this past weekend i was doing some work on the cabinets in my kitchen and had my toolbox sitting on the stove when i heard my voltage detector going off i took it out and cleared off the stove and held it above the stove and it went off it will continue to go off for about inches above the stove what could be causing this i have never been shocked by it or anything it sounds like your range doesn't have a good ground your range could be energized and you're just not feeling a shock 'cause you're not grounded while you are touching it try metering from bare metal on your range to the ground or neutral slot big slot on a nearby recepticle if your showing significant voltage you should look into grounding your range those induction voltage detectors have a knack for picking up static charges and giving false alarms too  Tesla coil Microphone Circuit design Mass spectrometry Electrophysiology Loudspeaker Lineman (occupation) Dualism (philosophy of mind) Piezoelectricity Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Phase-locked loop Capacitor Naval mine Stove Federal Standard 1037C Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Terran (StarCraft) Kitchen Lightning rod Transformer Protoss X-ray Radio Residual-current device Screw Resistor CMOS Solar cell Volt Zerg Static (superhero) Analog-to-digital converter Electroshock gun Neutrino Combine (Half-Life 2) High-voltage direct current Electric power transmission Decibel Ground (electricity) Lightning Heckler & Koch G3 Nuclear explosion Welding Electricity meter Electric shock Ground and neutral Commodore 64 National Electrical Code (US) Land mine Wind turbine Alternating current Static inverter plant Clementine mission ATLAS experiment Voltmeter Thermal power station Stave church Fire alarm control panel X-ray astronomy Knife Second Battle of the Atlantic Three-phase electric power Mercury Cougar Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Action potential Switched-mode power supply Directed-energy weapon Shaggy dog story Van de Graaff generator Oscilloscope Electrical breakdown Ultraviolet Table saw Bass guitar Gas metal arc welding Electricity pylon Galileo spacecraft I'm Alan Partridge Sensor Railway electrification system Electronic amplifier The Time Machine Lynyrd Skynyrd GunBound Gramophone record Single-phase electric power Earthing system Audiophile Particle accelerator AC/DC Semiconductor device Cherenkov radiation Portable stove Electricity Wheatstone bridge Relay

what are the pros and cons of insulating my house i want to insulate under the floor there is a crawlspace and i'm wondering if this is a good idea or will it trap moisture against the wood floorboards also it gets really hot in the attic in summer and i wanted to insulate the roof the ceiling floor of the attic is already well insulated sure under the floor between the joists and then put a vapor barrier up against the insulation that way no moisture will enter the insulation from below as for the attic it is suppose to be hot up there and there are either soffit vents that allow air to circulate up into the attic or vents on the gable ends depends on roof type that does the same thing this circulation keeps the house cool in the summer and warmer in the winter insulating the roof will lead to quicker dry rot of the wood  Basement Diving suit Solar power Air conditioning Electrical wiring Timber framing HVAC Roof Glossary of firefighting terms Straw-bale construction Passive solar Brewery Fire fighting Ice Thermal power station Ventilation Thermoregulation Water Fog Solar collector Langstroth hive Water vapor Transformer Heat Seismic retrofit Bungalow Sento Spark plug Autonomous building Mattress Wood Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Cannabis cultivation Plywood Humidity Upholstery Lighting Asbestos California Plumbing fixture Natural building Precipitation (meteorology) Fume hood El Ni__o The House of the Seven Gables Bath Relative humidity Internal combustion engine Platform framing Domestic water system Monsoon Plastic Space Shuttle external tank Campfire Swamp cooler Glossary of firefighting equipment Carbon dioxide Polyethylene terephthalate Xanadu House Air pollution Stairway Renewable energy Climate of the United Kingdom Anticyclone Home repair House Sugar beet Ocean thermal energy conversion Building material Refrigerator car California Bungalow Cruising (maritime) Sauna Thunderstorm Comanche Weather lore Jet engine Window Wood carving Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Hamster Yosemite National Park Fan (implement) Urban heat island Water heater Water (molecule) Explosive material Dymaxion house MOSFET Volkswagen Golf Carnivorous plant Thermostat Volcano Shotgun house Noah's Ark K__ppen climate classification Casting

what could be wrong with my domestic water pressure pump connected to tank hi i have a water pressure pump connected to a large water tank on a holiday shack it runs from a w w modified square wave inverter when i plug it in i can hear the motor running but it is not pumping any water this is a pump that has a pressure bladder sitting on top of it the noise it makes is quite loud but i can't see that anything is moving when looking at the end there is some kind of cooling fan that looks to be connected to the main drive that is stationary it looks like it wants to move but isnt getting anywhere the tank is full and on the same level as the pump shack without the pump running i can turn on a tape and water dribbles out so i am thinking this is not an issue with priming etc from what i understand the modified square wave input should be fine too any ideas as to what i should check what may be wrong any traps to look out for if i get a qualified peron to fix it am thinking i may be better of replacing with a cheap pump my water pressure was low as yours and luckily i had a handyman talk me thru the procedure via phone i have a different system as i have a well but the problem turned out to be a pressure regulator switch every time ya turn water on off this activates the switch sits on top of the pressure tank you wouldn't believe how many guys tried to get me to believe my tank itself was shot and more so anyways it may be just a switch i would lean towards a person that services sump pumps rather than your whole system as well companies are hard to come by in my area you may need a pump but it may only be the switch itself  Thermal power station Solar power Carburetor Thermostat Transformer Vacuum Electric motor Hydraulic machinery Loudspeaker Embedded system E85 Aircraft engine controls Gas compressor Diesel engine Pump Programmable logic controller Steam engine Apollo Command/Service Module Toyota Prius Locomotive Motor oil Space shuttle main engine Wave power Three Mile Island Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling throws Irrigation Renewable energy Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Rail terminology Hydrogen economy Glossary of firefighting equipment Brewery Motorcycle Heinkel He 100 B-47 Stratojet Naval mine Electrical generator Switch Combine harvester Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Windows 2000 Debugging Air conditioning Novelty (locomotive) Glossary of firefighting terms Water supply Blood pressure Stirling engine Dialysis Sewage treatment Fossil fuel power plant Commodore 64 2003 North America blackout Internal combustion engine Mooney M20 Pump It Up Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Glossary of wildland fire terms Dimmer Phase-locked loop Federal Standard 1037C Dairy Hard disk STS-61 Tank Two-stroke cycle Transmission (mechanics) Solar cell Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Urinary incontinence Hydropneumatic Switched-mode power supply Autonomous building ALGOL 68 ZX Spectrum Hydropower Three-phase electric power Uninterruptible power supply Cavitation Dundas Square Vacuum cleaner Pebble bed reactor Sonar Musical Instrument Digital Interface Scuba set Time Out of Mind

no water pressure i have no water pressure in my kitchen sink hot or cold my bath room sink and bathtub nd floor have normal pressure as dose my washing machine st floor what could be the issue i just took the aerator off and the water from the actual spout is no running up to power since the water pressure problem is isolated to just the kitchen sink the st thing i'd check would be the angle stops under the sink to be sure they are on all the way use the old righty tighty lefty loosey to turn'em on and off if the angle stops under the sink are on all the way the next place to check is the aerator that's the part of the faucet where the water actually comes out of on the spout there is a screen at that opening that could be clogged with debris it also comes off with the righty tighty lefty loosey with the help of a wrench and is likely to be the obvious suspect once it's off clean the screen and re install the aerator to the kitchen faucet that should get'cha going again good luck susan  Sento Tap (valve) Plumbing fixture Kitchen Japanese toilet Bidet Changeroom Domestic water system Bathroom Dishwashing Siphon Sewage treatment Thermal power station Water Water (molecule) Carburetor Pan Am Flight 103 Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Fuzzy logic Vacuum cleaner Washroom Propeller Fire fighting Dishwasher Coffee Toilet Mnemonic Baby bottle USS Wahoo (SS-238) Oceanic trench Sauna USS Yorktown (CV-5) Carbon dioxide USS Tunny (SS-282) HVAC Hydroponics Dam Bathing Houseplant Sailing Drill bit 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Poker jargon Cannabis cultivation Steam engine Billiards Cheating in Counter-Strike Toilet paper Coriolis effect Furnace Bong Frankfurt kitchen Greywater Equine conformation Ocean thermal energy conversion Refrigerator Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Jala neti Spontaneous human combustion Obstetrics Debugging Blood (computer game) Wrench Cruising (maritime) Acute respiratory distress syndrome Dry cleaning Baptism Diving Wound Elevator Glossary of firefighting equipment The Star Wars Holiday Special Stove Ariel (Firefly episode) Mirror Foodborne illness Rail terminology Tattoo The Price Is Right 2003 North America blackout Dymaxion house Solar power Axial compressor Windows XP Jet engine Happy Tree Friends Japanese tea ceremony Fire alarm control panel Brewery Suicide methods Conspiracy (TNG episode) RMS Titanic 1957 World Series Tank Babe Ruth Will Eisner Electrophysiology Residual-current device

is this basement support problem a minor one my family is moving across the country to chicago and i spent one weekend there looking for houses our favorite house showed a few problems on inspection and since we couldn't be there it is hard to determine the severity of those problems our big concern is the finding in the basement of sag noted at main beam in basement crushing is noted on main beam at bearing point of steel posts drop in structure noted on both upper living levels toward center of house recommend further review and corrections as needed by qualified contractors which may include carpenter and structural engineer as luck would have it i happened to take a picture which captured the crushing at one of the posts you can view it at http i tinypic com mjcy jpg the house is years old with the second story added at some point afterwards so obviously the weight increased and they might not have added extra support any advice does it look sound like a dealbreaker you can add a couple more support posts but remember you're going to have to cut out some concrete anf dig out some dirt and pour a fotting for the support post to sit on then you'll need to fill in to floor height the support post must be captured inside the concrete you'll need to ask at the city office where this house is once the new posts are in you can begin the process of jacking up the support beam to get your floors leveled out it's a long and slow process or should be or you'll crack the walls and such upstairs if the sinking is bad you will notice that doors will stick and not want to open and close properly one thing that i also noticed in the picture is that the handrail leading down to the basement is not legal the spindles can not be more than apart did the inspector mention that in his report maybe that's not an issue there but i know here you would not get an occupancy permit the way it is  Basement Stairway Seismic retrofit Air-raid shelter The Basement Tapes Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Drill bit Concrete Equine conformation Wood Opportunity rover Hard disk Elevator Poker jargon The Shining (film) Downing Street memo Textile manufacturing Timber framing Bad Wolf Linked list Prisons in the United States Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Straw-bale construction Suspension bridge Reinforced concrete Sento Violin Volleyball Oscilloscope World Trade Center The Suffering (game) Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans Quotation mark Scientology beliefs and practices Article One of the United States Constitution MS-06 Zaku II ISO 9000 2000 Australian Grand Prix Animal Crossing Expert system Faster-than-light Bristol Grammar School National Football League Lighting Motorcycle Speed limit George W.

fridge giving off fishy smell from outisde back fridge about yrs old fishy smell coming from the back outside somewhere there is at the bottom a black metal box and onto a plastic thing clipped on it has a dome wit something inside and above it is where the condensation water drips onto on the plastic around the dome liquid has collated and is like a mukky yellow colour and black food bits how do you clean this ive been told not to touch it cos it could be the acid stuff the inside of the fridge has been cleaned a cpl of times with bicard and the hole isn't blocked im wondering if the yellow stuff is causing the smell the black domed thing is a compressor this is what pumps the gas around the system and creates the cooling effect inside the fridge the plastic thing on top is the vapouriser tray when condensation builds up inside the fridge or it defrosts the water runs into the tray and the heat generated by the compressor gently evaporates the water away unclip the tray and wash it out clean the inside of the fridge paying attention to the drain fitting replace the tray and put the clips back on while you have the fridge pulled out i also suggest that you brush or hoover off the pipework at the back of the fridge this is called the condenser and the part of the refrigeration that expells the unwanted heat from inside the fridge and the cooling system in answer to some of the other answers if the fridge is still getting cool inside it has not got a gas leak and if gas was escaping from a fridge of that age it would have a strong nutty smell secondly electrical wiring or electrical components burning out do not smell of fish they have a burning smell  Bong Air conditioning Solar power Phase change heat pump Natural gas Printed circuit board Autonomous building Dairy Motor oil Sulfur Gas absorption refrigerator Brewery Fractional distillation Fossil fuel power plant Soldering Fire extinguisher Fire fighting Carbon dioxide Casting Plastic Thermal power station Thermostat Water (molecule) Ocean thermal energy conversion Tofu Haloalkane Town gas Hydrogen peroxide Evaporation Vacuum Coffee Hydrogen economy Jet engine Hydrogen Basement Cray-1 Kitchen Energy development Pebble bed reactor Furnace Hydroponics Glass Heinkel He 100 Titanium Internal ballistics Poker jargon M16 (rifle) Electrical wiring Glossary of firefighting terms Textile manufacturing Phase (matter) Drill bit Steam engine Tire Refrigeration Geodesic dome Bread Alcohol fuel Stirling engine Seismic retrofit Spark plug Dry cleaning Home repair Turbocharger Ozone Swamp cooler Vacuum tube Swimming pool Knife Petroleum Fuse (electrical) Explosive material Ester Hand grenade Polyethylene terephthalate Mercury (element) Cruising (maritime) Water vapor Turbojet Heat Milk Japanese tea ceremony Computer cooling Breathing gas Incandescent light bulb Renewable energy Origin of life Naval mine

how do you adjust the govner on a briggs stratton hp motor i wouldnt mess with the governer if its a power issue well best result would be to get a larger motor power can also be attained from adjusting the carb only if it has the fuel mix screw in the bottom of the float bowl when its cold adjust the fuel mix screw all the way in gently as not to damage the tip then adjust out turns start the motor and adjust out till motor stumbles then back in till it smooths out if that doesnt work try cleaning the carb and resetting it messing with a governer could cause the motor to explode by overrevving the max rpm is only going over that could cause the flywheel to shatter and explosive results kidd  Carburetor Drill bit Bong Toyota Prius Anchor Diesel engine E85 Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Propeller Rotary engine Internal combustion engine Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Electric vehicle Flywheel energy storage Radio controlled airplane Automobile self starter Two-stroke cycle Gasoline Briggs & Stratton Toyota Corolla Ford Windsor engine VTEC Hybrid vehicle Lathe Four-stroke cycle Thermal power station Naval mine Phonograph Combine harvester Freewheel Battery electric vehicle Timpani Radio controlled car Engine tuning Spark plug Motor oil Electric motor Punt (boat) USS Tunny (SS-282) Fossil fuel power plant Jet engine Super Metroid Glacier Model aircraft USS S-32 (SS-137) Fuel injection Drill Chevrolet Small-Block engine Kart racing Alcohol fuel Screw Aircraft engine controls Variable Frequency Drive Drag racing Energy development Items in the Metroid series USS West Virginia (BB-48) Ford FE engine Electrical generator Nuclear fusion Helicopter Mazda RX-7 St. Nazaire Raid Oldsmobile V8 engine Screwdriver M16 (rifle) Toyota Land Cruiser Inertial confinement fusion Gas compressor Flywheel Nuclear power Stirling engine Honda Civic Hybrid Motorcycle Space shuttle main engine Railgun Hard disk Dodge Neon Uninterruptible power supply USS Tautog (SS-199) De Lorean DMC-12 Chevrolet Corvair engine Zero-emissions vehicle Honda Prelude BMW M5 Gas turbine Turbocharger Submarine Torpedo Violin Lawn mower Apollo 13 Transmission (mechanics) Rocket fuel Nitroglycerin Locomotive Model rocket Chevrolet Corvette Continuously variable transmission Wankel engine

what are the advantages of doing a roof layover vs reroofing one's home it seems a roof layover provides great cost savings yet few in the roofing industry reccomend it is this at all related to profit margins a layover only delays the inevitable you add weight to your roof and ultimately you've got to strip it off you may save money in the short term but if it's a long term home investment don't try to cheap out they're not trying to get the extra buck out of you because they can but because they should  Deflation (economics) Gross domestic product Anarchism and capitalism Insurance Economy of Russia FairTax Roof Bank Surplus value Public good Inflation Monopoly Financial services Capital accumulation Narrow gauge Corporate finance Ryanair Free trade Arbitrage Variable universal life insurance Capitalism PE ratio 2005 World Series Spaceward, Ho!

propane gas to heat a dryer or an electric dryer we have a propane gas line hookup in the laundry room the question is why would i buy a gas dryer over an electric one it does not seem to save that much money thoughts does anyone use a propane gas line for their dryer vs natural gas if you have a decent rate for your electricity then a propane dryer will not save you much in the way of utilities in some areas the cost for electricity is high and propane may be cheaper there are other reasons to have a propane dryer an electric dryer takes a amp circuit if your wiring is old you may not have the capacity for this another reason could be that a previous owner had a natural gas dryer when they moved to this house and decided to convert to propane instead of buying a new one if you already have an electric outlet sized for a dryer in the laundry room and your electric rates are suitable i would go for the electric if the outlet is not there call an electrician to get a price to install a new circuit and make sure it will work with your service equipment before you commit to an electric dryer  Hydrogen economy Three-phase electric power Propane Natural gas Solar cell Electrical wiring Thermal power station Petroleum Electrical generator Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Gas metal arc welding Circuit breaker Fuel injection Kitchen BS 1363 Fuse (electrical) Manitoba Hydro Autonomous building Transformer Future energy development Enron Corporation Relay Electrical wiring (UK) Cruising (maritime) Alcohol fuel Printed circuit board Gas turbine-electric locomotive Residual-current device Grid energy storage Sewage treatment Battery electric vehicle Nuclear power phase-out Central processing unit Welding Electric power transmission Hydroelectricity Split phase Alternating current Renewable energy Wood fuel Fossil fuel power plant High-voltage hazards Thermostat Locomotive Biodiesel Nuclear reactor Oscilloscope Digital Subscriber Line Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus High-voltage direct current Pacific Gas and Electric Company Electrician Nuclear power Airsoft Futures contract Seismic retrofit Pebble bed reactor Heat Fuel cell National Electrical Code (US) Breathing gas Vacuum tube Gas turbine Air conditioning Soldering Sport utility vehicle Light rail Circuit design Incandescent light bulb Fire extinguisher Optical fiber Power line communication Energy development Filling station Loudspeaker Fluorescent lamp Paintball Power station Balloon (aircraft) Scuba set Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Internal combustion engine Thermocouple Arbitrage Oxy-fuel welding and cutting MOSFET Temperature Gas tungsten arc welding Transistor Overclocking Analog-to-digital converter Spark gap

air condition problem my a c on for min and then the outside fan the fan on top of the ac is off but the unit still running cold air still come out i have to turn the unit off so it will not overheat the unit after min off i turn the unit on and the it will run normally again for another min i am not sure it is the fan motor or the capacitor problem i would say you have a condensor fan motor that is overheating probably due to bearings going out even though the motor may appear to move smoothly the bearings could be starting to run dry making it wanting to overamp i would replace the motor around and of course when you change the motor always put in a new capacitor  Electric motor Capacitor plague E85 Ford Ranger EV Thermal power station Carburetor Motor oil Fan (implement) STS-61 Diesel engine Jet engine Battery (electricity) 2005 United States Grand Prix Auto racing Hard disk Toyota Prius Engine cooling Electronic amplifier Thermostat M4 Carbine Irrigation Fuel injection Heinkel He 100 Chris Amon Hyperthermia 1957 World Series Axial compressor Hendrick Motorsports Membrane potential Indianapolis 500 Bristol Motor Speedway Radio controlled car B-29 Superfortress Automobile MRAM Action potential Horsepower Air conditioning Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Elevator Circuit design Drag racing Indianapolis Motor Speedway R46 (New York City Subway car) Electrophysiology Hybrid vehicle Transformer 2003 United States Grand Prix 24 Hours of Le Mans Microwave oven M16 (rifle) De Havilland DH.88 Formula One Torque Typewriter Tesla coil Linear motor Canada at the 2004 Summer Olympics Vacuum cleaner STS-62 Chevrolet Corvair engine Stirling engine Gas metal arc welding Minutes PC motherboard American Motors Armoured warfare Swingout General Motors streetcar conspiracy 1987 World Series Climate of the United Kingdom X10 (industry standard) Microphone Drowning Batman Returns Energy development Pontiac Ernie Irvan Valentino Rossi Bristol Beaufighter Knots Landing Hawker Hurricane Radio controlled airplane Project Nike Ford Motor Company Cleveland Browns Mouse (computing) Equation of time Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Dialysis Internal combustion engine Diving suit Kart racing Aircraft engine controls B-47 Stratojet Martin-Marietta X-24 City Hunter Swamp cooler Two-stroke cycle 2004 American League Championship Series

plumbing issues with sink i have a double sink with disposal in one side i can't get any water to drain from the sink and everytime i turn on the disposal it just pumps water into the other sink that doesn't have a disposal then when the water drains from the sink without the disposal it just fills back into the first sink so basically no water is draining and it is just going from sink to sink what should i do your drain is plugged could be from too much material in the disposal at one time to properly flush out the drain lines the drains from both sinks usually connect together under the sink running through one p trap and out one drain get a bucket and remove the p trap you may need to pull material out of the drain also use a plumber's snake for this then re connect everything and run some water to flush out any remaining debris  Plumbing fixture Domestic water system Siphon Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Sewer Drainage Autonomous building Flush toilet Dialysis Sewage treatment Thermal power station Toilet Dairy Motor oil IRT Flushing Line Urinal RuneScape Mini-Games Oceanic trench Hydroponics Firefighter Garbage disposal Menstrual cup Eggerland series Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Bong Panama Canal Locks Dredge Toilet humour Dennis Nilsen Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Glossary of firefighting equipment Water purification Canoe Circulatory system Spark plug MOSFET Zuiderzee Works Rebreather Coriolis effect Toilet paper Derbyshire lead mining history Kitchen Strap-on dildo Dishwashing Japanese toilet Naruto jutsu Soldering Fountain Carburetor Septic tank Seismic retrofit Road Wario Sin City Irrigation Mercury 4 Drill bit 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Sewage Brewery Erie Canal Glossary of wildland fire terms USS Vestal (AR-4) Home repair Composting toilet Basement Dam Sea ice Poker jargon E85 USS Swordfish (SSN-579) Alcohol fuel RMS Titanic Canal lock Protoss Brent Spar Borehole Sewage collection and disposal Sento Panama Canal Unterseeboot 505 Hurricane Katrina timeline Professional wrestling throws Waking the Dragons Dundas Square Beer Pong Debris USS United States (1797) Vacuum cleaner Sailing Carbon dioxide sink Professional wrestling holds Drain cleaner Tampon Concrete Ship USS Yorktown (CV-5) Landfill Pinball

is there something i can add to my hot water heating boiler system to clean the registers out or something to increase the heat they release you don't want to add anything to a hot water system the problem is you have air in the system you need to go to each register and find the bleeder for each unit open it up to let the air escape and leave it open until water starts to come out then if you don't have an automatic valve that adds water to the system you need to open the valve yourself and watch the gauge till the gauge reads between and psi if you don't know anything about doing this you need to call a heating contractor to do this as you could have the system blow up on you  Thermal power station Carburetor Diving regulator Furnace Thermostat Two-stroke cycle Three Mile Island Steam engine Novelty (locomotive) Stirling engine Steam locomotive nomenclature HVAC Rebreather Rail terminology Siphon Brewery Boiler Space shuttle main engine Glossary of firefighting equipment Vacuum tube Fossil fuel power plant Sento Timeline of steam power Dodge Neon Sleeve valve Gas tungsten arc welding Variable valve timing Heat Heat exchanger Diving cylinder Air conditioning Glossary of firefighting terms Bunsen burner Pneumatics Water heater Spark plug Internal combustion engine Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Four-stroke cycle Central processing unit CPU design Cookware and bakeware Steam (content delivery) Process control Town gas Turbocharger Central heating Flush toilet Oxyacetylene Engine cooling Samovar Slow cooker Environmental concerns with electricity generation Fire fighting Pulse jet engine Explosive material Trumpet Hydraulic head (hydrology) Space Shuttle external tank Turbojet Bong Dialysis Aircraft engine controls Gauge theory Chevrolet Corvair Coffee Nuclear meltdown John Bull (locomotive) Gas compressor Horn (instrument) IA-32 Jet engine Snorkel Baby bottle Solar power Glossary of wildland fire terms Fuel injection Diving suit Pebble bed reactor Diving Hydraulic ram Renewable energy PID controller Irrigation Home repair History of rail transport in Ireland Energy development Quantum harmonic oscillator Containment building Manifold vacuum Evaporation Tesla coil Automatic transmission Diesel engine Temperature VTEC Fire hydrant Stove

toilet wont flush any idea on how to fix this how much water should be in the tank you haven't given enough info to really address this since you asked how much water should be in the tank i assume the toilet works when you push down the handle but won't flush clean leaving residue in the bowl if this is the case then get a bucket or large pan and fill it with water pour the water directly into the center of the bowl pour it quickly but stop pouring if the backs up if the bowl is not stopped up the water will evacuate quickly taking anything in the bowl with it if it doesn't flush then it is clogged at least partially if this is the case get a toilet auger a ' long snake with a piece of rubber tubing on it which keeps the toilet from being scratched the auger goes up into the trap and can be twisted and pushed in and out until you clear the blockage if the toilet doesn't operate at all when you push the handle then take the top off the tank and look inside there are two things in the toilet one the ballcock lets the water in it usually is on the left side of the tank and has some sort of float on it the other is the flush valve and it lets the water out into the bowl if you push the handle and nothing happens follow the handle inside the toilet and see if it is attached to the flapper or wire and chain ball over the flush valve if not replace what's not attached as for the first idea toilets have a finely tuned water flow from the tank to the bowl as the water is allowed out of the tank it comes to the bowl through small holes under the rim these are designed to cause a swirling action that helps evacuate the bowl if the toilet is old these can get clogged with sediment and need to be cleaned out use a pipe cleaner or something small to push into each hole use a small mirror to help you see the holes i hope this helps with your problem if not please be more specific about what's happening  Bong Carburetor Siphon Drill bit Urinal Japanese toilet Thermal power station Internal ballistics Toilet paper Rebreather Electrophysiology Trombone Menstrual cup Toilet humour Seismic retrofit Sewage treatment Hydraulic machinery Brewery Coriolis effect Vacuum tube Two-stroke cycle Casting M16 (rifle) Tire Solar power Naval mine Urinary incontinence Plumbing fixture Domestic water system Chevrolet Corvair engine Firearm Diving regulator Dairy Motorcycle Coffee Professional wrestling match types Timpani Autonomous building RISC Chainsaw Poker jargon Textile manufacturing Thermostat Irrigation Knife Windows XP Fire fighting Samovar Glossary of nautical terms Canal lock Carbon dioxide Diving suit Sento Vacuum Elevator Hamster Strap-on dildo Opportunity rover Snorkel Amateur telescope making Apollo Command/Service Module Home repair Water polo Maple syrup Tractor Smoking pipe Steam engine Plastic Cat Four-stroke cycle Krag-J__rgensen Sewer Panama Canal Locks Borehole Cruising (maritime) Semiconductor device Energy development Pile Sin City Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Computer CPU cache Piccolo Junior Saga Baby bottle Mach kernel Septic tank Pinball Water turbine Second Battle of the Atlantic Oxy-fuel welding and cutting

why are my light switch plates bowing outwards i have several light switch cover plates that are bowing out there doesn't seem to be any pressure on them as if i overtightened the screws it seems like heat or something else is causing them to bend out i did find a way to straighten them though place them in the oven at degrees for about minutes or so flat now but why did they bend in the first place you stumped me in years of electrical work i have never run across this one i have seen them burned and melted in places from loose connections and arcing but never bowed do they feel hot if they feel hot call an electrician but the chances of having a bad switch or connection in more than one switch at a time is like winning the lottery not likely leave some comments which way did they bow in or out interesting good luck  Spark plug Welding Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Equine conformation Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Tire Incandescent light bulb Oscilloscope Aluminium Solar power Gas metal arc welding Carburetor Tesla coil Wok Cookware and bakeware Rail terminology Vacuum tube Movie projector Seismic retrofit Canoe Stove Fluorescent lamp Circuit breaker USS Tunny (SS-282) Solar system Ironing Violin Professional wrestling holds Casting BS 1363 USS Thresher (SS-200) Hydraulic machinery Mattress Thermostat Residual-current device Woodworking Glass Particle accelerator Tank Fabrication (metal) Customs and etiquette of Japan Mouse (computing) Jet engine Mercury Atlas 6 Light switch Diode Gesture STS-61 Sundial Aerial (dance move) Arc welding Archery Drill bit Kitchen Luck Salute Avalanche Explosive material Upholstery Spacecraft propulsion Motor oil Corona Fan (implement) Switch Hot air balloon Fast bowling USS Trigger (SS-237) Gas tungsten arc welding Steam engine Fire fighting Overhead lines Titanium Steel Glossary of climbing terms 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Screw William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin Terminal ballistics Stage lighting Drill Cheating in poker Softball Professional wrestling throws Galileo spacecraft Heat Cavity magnetron Hand grenade Relay Transformer Agar plate Mercury-vapor lamp Venus Internal ballistics USS Wahoo (SS-238) Campfire Aurora (astronomy) Knife Rail tracks

hot switchplate i have a switchplate that has an on off switch for the outside porch light and a foyer chandellier dimmer when the chandellier is on the switchplate gets very hot could this cause a fire how do i correct this issue freakboynv is the closest the aluminum plate that sits just behind the switch cover is designed to dissipate heat that is generated by the dimmer it is common to have a warm switch plate if there is a dimmer even if you are not dimming to any great degree the most common dimmers usually are rated to around watts add up the wattage of each lamp that is in the light fixture to discover the total watts you are attempting to control if you are too high change the lamps to a lower wattage or buy a dimmer with a higher rating the higher ones however can be a bit pricey if you find that you are drawing less than the normal watts i would not worry too much if you remove the plate you will be able to read the rating that is stamped into the aluminum heat sink on the dimmer note when new the aluminum dimmer heat sinks are about the same size as a single switch plate sometimes when there is more than one item in a box it become necessary to break off the perimeter tabs of the heat sink to be able to fit it in with other items as the tabs are removed the overall wattage rating of the dimmer is decreased thus you can't run as much wattage as it could when the heat sink was complete i you are not sure go the store and look at a new one so you can get an idea of how they look new compaired to what yours looks like  Dimmer Light switch Incandescent light bulb Stage lighting Transformer Lighting Transistor Bicycle lighting Headlight Central processing unit Fluorescent lamp Welding Tire Gas metal arc welding Sun Seismic retrofit Circuit design Solar power Internal ballistics Mercury Atlas 6 X10 (industry standard) Vacuum tube Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Aluminium Compact fluorescent lamp Fuse (electrical) Electrical wiring Carburetor CPU design Thermal power station Oscilloscope Electronic amplifier Floppy disk DMX (lighting) Brewery Switched-mode power supply Loudspeaker Heat M16 (rifle) Cookware and bakeware Electric motor Jet engine Light-emitting diode Drill bit Solar variation RISC Compact disc Steam engine William Murdoch Pebble bed reactor Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Resistor Plate tectonics E85 Stove Urban heat island Plasma (physics) Electrodeless lamp Surveillance Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Harmonica Screw Renewable energy Carbon dioxide Laser Mouse (computing) Kitchen Tank CPU cache Disc brake Rail terminology Steel Sewage treatment Bong Fume hood Nuclear fusion Mars Exploration Rover Thermoregulation Eye Ford Ranger EV Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Heat sink Solar system Password Bicycle Digital photography Spacecraft propulsion Spark plug Messerschmitt Bf 109 Audiophile German car number plates Redundant array of independent disks Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Ozone depletion Sodium vapor lamp Armored Core

how can i access my central a c's evaporator to clean it i know where it's located but it's inside a sealed sheet metal box there are screws on one side of the plenum but the pipes running to the evaporator from the outside unit prevent me from pulling it open the air coming out of the vents isn't as cold as it used to be and i've cleaned every other part of my a c except for the evaporator it's never been cleaned for the years that it's been there i can only imagine how much dirt and dust is on it if your unit is years old you owe it to yourself to replace it a high efficiency system will save you on your electric cost for example if your cooling bill is per month then by replacing it you save per month however if you want to just clean the coil if it is in a closet upflow you will have to remove the front cover of the cased coil slide the coil out and then using hydrofloric acid spray the coil from the under side then rinse the acid off with water it works best if the coil is removed taken outside and cleaned however i think you are wanting the least expensive way out if the coil is located in the attic horizontal cut a hole in the transition and clean it with acid again rinsing it with water be careful with the acid it will burn your skin and eyes if it gets on you however it has been my experience that coils of this age range usually develop a freon leak after they have been disturbed a licensed service company will usually do this for good luck but it may not be cooling well for other reasons as well for example a dirty air filter coils outside are dirty or it is low on refrigerant best of luck  Air conditioning Carburetor Brewery Thermostat Haloalkane Thermal power station Refrigerator Loudspeaker Solar power Mattress Drill bit Bong Soldering Incandescent light bulb Transformer Spark plug HVAC Hard disk Naval mine Autonomous building Furnace Motor oil Irrigation Vacuum Stove E85 Fossil fuel power plant Phase change heat pump Ocean thermal energy conversion Welding Casting Dry cleaning Heinkel He 100 Cray-1 Fluorescent lamp M16 (rifle) Bass guitar Internal ballistics Glossary of firefighting equipment Ammonia Floppy disk Ozone depletion Battery (electricity) Textile manufacturing Asbestos Swamp cooler Nuclear power Tesla coil Energy development Solar cell Smoke-screen Ozone hole Vacuum cleaner Wire Hydrogen peroxide Gramophone record Door Hard water Air pollution Sento Electric motor Two-stroke cycle Fuel injection Galileo spacecraft Professional wrestling throws Naruto jutsu Menstrual cup Ice core Seismic retrofit Soap Tire Home repair Cathode ray tube Fume hood Vacuum tube Screw Tattoo Motorcycle Internal combustion engine Rocket fuel Hydrogen economy First aid Flush toilet Printed circuit board Body piercing Pebble bed reactor Hydraulic machinery Inertial guidance system Shampoo Cartridge (firearms) Tofu Fire fighting Diving suit

is it worth the price to replace a y o central air conditioner it works fine but i've heard that newer units spend much less electricity and cool better yes it is more economical and will save you money over that system and don't forget to start now and do your homework you can get it cheaper since your not in a hurry and it still works waiting till it goes out will make it uncomfortable and most contractors are least week or two out before they can get to you look for rebate deals mind you that if you buy both your furnace and ac together you can save a whole bunch by combining the work late winter or early spring is the best time to buy ac  Daylight saving time Solar power CPU design Money supply Central processing unit Solar cell Thermal power station Hydrogen economy Social rule Autonomous building Keynesian economics Inflation Publicly funded medicine Air conditioning Hyperinflation ITV Microeconomics Tire Mutual fund Time Out of Mind Health insurance IBM PC compatible Mouse (computing) Space Shuttle program FairTax F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Deflation (economics) Wheel of Fortune Commodore 64 Wal-Mart Arbitrage Tax HVAC Bank Economy of Russia Nuclear power Economy of the United States Radeon Thermostat Furnace Theory of conduct Gross domestic product Shaggy dog story Personal rapid transit Enron Corporation Futurama (TV series - season 5) U.S. public debt Education in the People's Republic of China Common Agricultural Policy Steel Monopoly (game) British Rail Class 86 Warren Buffett Gwen Stefani Famine Nuclear reactor Price discrimination Diesel engine Hybrid vehicle Paleoclimatology RuneScape economy UK Singles Chart Grid energy storage Leeds United F.C.

pedestal sink plumbing problem first off i'd like to say that i am not a plumber so i don't really know anything about it other than common sense anyways i have just installed a pedestal sink after first removing the past vanity sink so i hooked the flexible cords from the hot and cold faucet to the shut off valves on the wall and where the cords meet the shut off valve they are leaking water a little bit i tried using caulk but it won't stick since the tube or nuts are wet is there anything maybe like a spray foam or something that i can put on them to dry fast and adhere to a wet surface to keep it from leaking thanks to any answers that come my way i need them there are several types of supply tube flexible cord connections available solution depends upon which type you have braided type have a wire mesh covering the full length of the tube and nuts permanently attached to the end if you have these you need to remove any remaining caulk or other goop that you may have put on them dry the threads on the valve and wrap a few layers of teflon plumbing tape around the threads instead of teflon tape you can use pipe joint compound but it is messier reconnect the fitting and you should be good to go the pipe threads must be dry for either of these to work plastic or copper tubes with a ferrule these usually do not have a covering there is a nut that slides up and down on the pipe with a brass or plastic ring ferrule at the end of the pipe that connects to the valve if you are reusing an old supply tube you need to cut the tube just above the ferrule and install a new one of the same type then reconnect the fitting tighten just a bit more if you have a minor drip plastic tube with a molded flange at the end again no covering these also have a nut that will slide up and down on the tube but a flange is molded on the end instead of using a ferrule you may need to tighten this one just a bit more if this doesn't work it is likely that the flange has been deformed and you will need to replace the tube you can usually cut of the end and install a ferrule on these instead of replacing but make sure you buy a new nut and ferrule and replace both the nuts for use with ferrules are shaped just a bit different on the inside than the nut for a flange  Screw Casting Trombone Irrigation Tire Plastic Hydraulic machinery Seismic retrofit Glossary of firefighting equipment Electrical wiring Spark plug Domestic water system Wrench Thermal power station Drill bit Dialysis Guitar Violin Welding Soldering Diving regulator Tap (valve) Rail terminology Geodesic dome Textile manufacturing Mattress Carburetor Bullet Flush toilet Bong Climbing equipment Radio controlled airplane Siphon Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Printed circuit board Ethernet Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Steam engine Coaxial cable Brewery Strap-on dildo Urinary incontinence Textile manufacturing terminology Wire BS 1363 Brush Glossary of climbing terms Amateur telescope making Transistor Novelty (locomotive) Boat building Fuse (electrical) Fire extinguisher Bassoon Solar power Vacuum tube Equine conformation Diving suit Japanese toilet Furnace Cookware and bakeware Dental brace Urinal Menstrual cup Dishwasher Motorcycle Intravenous therapy Universal Serial Bus Carbon dioxide Carbon fiber Floppy disk Transformer Polystyrene Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Bolted joint Christmas tree Residual-current device Earring Submarine Roof Samovar Snorkel Cartridge (firearms) Hamster Haloalkane Glossary of nautical terms Manicure Bass guitar Apollo 13 Coppersmith Plaster Comanche

is it possible to have my drop in sink replaced with an undermount sink if i have granite countertops already i do not like the appearance of the drop in sink with the granite countertops but is it too late to replace the sink with an undermounted one will i have to get all new countertops which would be quite expensive once you decide on the drop in its hard to convert it to an undermount because of the cut and polishing needed around the hole you may be able to find someone or a rep can come in and estimate someone to come in to polish it down for a drop in  Granite Naval mine Second Battle of the Atlantic Great Pyramid of Giza The Brady Bunch Arcade cabinet Operation Market Garden Asbestos Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Nacre Dishwasher Plastic Norwegian Campaign Atari 8-bit family Weezer Boston and Lowell Railroad Aberdeen Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Z__oty Vickers Valiant Hubble Space Telescope Diamond Drill bit Polish language Non-native pronunciations of English Future energy development Gramophone record Attack on Pearl Harbor Uranium 1957 World Series Latin alphabet Teletext U.S. invasion of Afghanistan USS Tunny (SS-282) Battle of Berlin USS Wahoo (SS-238) Diode Floppy disk HMS Dragon (D46) High-definition television Irrigation The Late Show with David Letterman History of Poland Diorite Dwarfism Marian Rejewski First Battle of the Atlantic Aluminium RuneScape weapons Nuclear power Battlecruiser World War II Polish September Campaign Boeing 747 RMS Titanic Alcohol fuel RuneScape quests Fountain pen Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Punch card Operation Petticoat WEWS-TV Katana Water (molecule) USS Washington (BB-56) Sears Holdings Corporation Submarine Stonehenge U.S. Senate election, 2004 RuneScape Mini-Games Dishwashing Old Colony Railroad Stanis__aw Sosabowski USS Sea Devil (SS-400) Mouse (computing) Big Dig Hard disk Kitchen Light-emitting diode Andes Dundas Square Rathfarnham Glossary of graph theory Polish-Soviet War People's Republic of Poland Air New Zealand USS Uhlmann (DD-687) Battle of Warsaw (1920) Armia Krajowa Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Vietnam Veterans Memorial Electrophysiology Black hole American Motors Alexandria Messerschmitt Bf 109 Aircraft carrier Thallium Battle of the Bulge Warsaw Uprising

want to polish hardwood floor by myself i think that i can do it but how just bought a house made awesome deal but there is only one problem that hardwood floors are in very bad condition i mean it needs polish very badly i don t know how many years ago they polished it last time after paying for down for the house and appliances the budget is very tight so i thought that my husband and me should do it by our self i know we can do it so guys please help give me some links to get info how to do it and need tips from your experience too and for supplies home depot or what what is the best store for supplies thanks a lotttttttt in advance star promise for help but more then that my blessings for you all i watch home garden tv and diy channel a lot but its my bad luck that dont remember any program about it checked there isnt any program schedule in this month about it on these channels one of my friend she doesnt know how to do but she told me to rent a machine sand and buff then paint so wanted to know in details and what kind a paint any name any brand please help hello i personally refinished all the floors in our older home as well when you say polish are you lookin' for just a protective finish or do they need to be 'resurfaced if just a finish is all you need then i recommend a trip to lowes paint dept ask for the mgr they will have the most training in this area they should be able to direct you to the best paste wax product for you needs however if they are needing to be resurfaced and they don't have stain damage the easiest way is to use a 'stripping agent' it's like a glorified nail polish remover my preference is one made by jasco it's called furniture refinisher comes in a wood grain gallon sized can used to be able to get it at orchard supply hardware if you can't find it at the store or online my second recommendation is a similar product made by formby s that is also a furniture refinisher you'll also need a few pkgs of steel wool comes in varying degrees of coarseness i recommend to oo for the stubborn areas you'll need at least to pkgs of each grade of steel wool whatever you don't use you can return i find it to be easier to return 'after' the project is done not somewhere in the middle of it i hate interruptions anyway your steps will be dip steel wool in old bowl of f r solution just like you would a scrub brush if you were cleanin' the floor spread ot the solution in a circular motion let it sit and soak for a minute or two this will loosen any old varnish from the floor as you begin to 'scour' the gunk will start to get trapped in your 'pad go over the same are with the next grade of steel wool following the same procedure then wipe with rags or paper towels i use the viva ones because they are the most absorbant when you have done these steps for the whole floor then you need to take a clean rag and using the solution pouring a little on the areas of the floor at a time then wiping with the clean rags you may have to change rags often to getoff any leftover residue it's like a rinse cycle let that dry for i'd say at least six hrs depending on your humidity once it is somewhat fume free you can apply a minwax stain if you want to alter the shade if not then i recommend either a wax polish or a sealing polyurythane finish it comes in a variety of sheens from matte to high gloss you just brush it on with a clean quality fair sized brush this product comes in gallon cans just like paint you can find it at either lowes or home depot i think it's made by minwax or flecto either one will do just be sure to look for the one that's made for floors it's a polyurythane follow the directions on the can you can also get backup info at lowes wish i were there to help get ya' started it is alot easier than most people think oh yeah make sure to pick up a couple of those disposable white respirator masks and be sure to open the windows for ventilation an to speed up the drying time hope this

can a little bend in copper tubeing cause low pressure i installed a faucet and it had copper tubeing i bent the copper tubeing a little bit not much the thing is i dont have alot of presure but the water source is a water well and it gives sand how thick is the copper tubing regardless if you have good pressure from the supply if you reduce it to lets say in to copper tubing it will restrict the flow also on another note if you installed a new faucet take the aerator off the faucet the aerator is the cap located where the water comes out of the faucet just turn counterclockwise run the water then is is still slow most times it can be the aerator caused by particles flowing through the old pipe to the new faucet rinse off the aerator and replace  Tap (valve) Siphon Sewage treatment Rebreather Irrigation Carburetor Welding Vacuum tube Diving regulator Furnace Carbon dioxide Brewery Plumbing fixture Tire Solar power Seismic retrofit Samovar Copper extraction Hard water Thermal power station Boiler Water purification Acute respiratory distress syndrome Optical fiber Soldering Sento Cartridge (firearms) Terminal ballistics Coppersmith Drill bit Aquifer Heat Hydraulic machinery Water tower Fossil fuel power plant Glass Naval mine Propeller Flush toilet Bong Turbulence Oscilloscope Coaxial cable Dialysis Corrosion Gas metal arc welding Kidney Cookware and bakeware Light-emitting diode Turbocharger Pulse jet engine Aluminium Hydroponics Fish farming Root Steam engine Fluorescent lamp Jet engine Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Electric motor Coriolis effect Casting Pebble bed reactor Internal ballistics Water turbine M16 (rifle) Tide Linear particle accelerator Thermostat Whitewater Diode Fire extinguisher Transformer Lake Urinal Hydrogen economy Novelty (locomotive) Printed circuit board Bullet Trombone Trumpet Heinkel He 100 Domestic water system Tobacco Knife Equine conformation Oceanic trench Soil pH Hydropower Water supply Carbon nanotube Incandescent light bulb Tap water Ocean thermal energy conversion Nuclear power Electrophysiology Dam Galileo spacecraft Compost Dairy

what can i add to latex paint to make it adhere better when i paint steel barrels i clean and wire brush them and wipe off any dust or dirt the paint will not adhere well for more than months the paint will blister peel and chip easily i have to repaint every year i need something to add for better adherence i know a few years ago there was a additive available thru the paint stores but today no one seems to know about any additives please help thank you the problem is not the paint the problem i think and in my opinion is that you are not using a primer the chemical aspects of the primer are numerous the top reasons to use a primer is that it will not stick immediately if there is a presence of oil and acts as a adhesive for the paint if that is the problem along with rust try navel jelly the navy uses it to paint their ships and address rust issues you can get this product at most ace stores or lowes or home depot or true value stores when using the primer it will act as a bonding agent for the primer and chemically bond the paint to the metal using the primer as the catalyst good luck jim  Paint Primer (paint) Epoxy Plastic Knife Explosive material Cartridge (firearms) Handloading Aluminium Internal ballistics Hydrochloric acid Organic peroxide Painter and decorator Titanium Stainless steel Welding Hand grenade Ammonium nitrate Lionel Corporation Adhesive Polymerase chain reaction Bulk vending Mattress Springfield 1903 rifle Energy development Steel Printed circuit board Acne Ammonia Union Pacific Railroad Hydrogen economy Poker jargon Iron Firearm Drill bit GoldenEye Pottery Motor oil Upholstery Fire extinguisher Fuel injection Carburetor Friction Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Violin Brush Money Carbon nanotube Casting Tin Gesso Lead paint Fire 64-bit Loudspeaker Hydrogen vehicle Industrial wastewater treatment Carbon dioxide Technetium Tattoo Computer Sulfuric acid Olive oil Wok Food preservation Bullet Gas metal arc welding Manicure IPod Raney nickel Soldering Mercury (element) Plame affair Benzene Soap Paint stripper Rifle Gasoline Haloalkane Alcohol fuel Cast iron Galvanization Gun safety CPU cache PlayStation 2 Adhesion Enzyme Redox Gilding Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Primer (molecular biology) Rust Pennsylvania Vermicompost Hard disk Manganese

year old house is it okay to buy is it okay to buy a house that is almost years old what are some things to look out for we don't mind doing cosmetic things but don't want to do anything structural or major is it a given that the basement will get seepage any advice would be greatly appreciated thanks any structure that you may purchase may have problems the way to tell is to determine whether or not there is wood rot in the main parameters of the structure a pest inspection will reveal alot of termite wood rot or fungae problems the real test is that you won't know until you actually pull a wall apart the older homes utilize a treatment called lathe and plaster these are small little boards that are about wide and run the span of the vertical members x or whatever they were running a years ago one good way to tell about the structure is look at the roof from feet look for sagging members look at the ridge boards and see if they sag look at the edge facia boards are they peeling take a nail d coated at poke at the different members all over the house if the wood is soft it is either dry rotted or diseased this is a start get a latter try looking under the soffit area directly above the wall backside of the roof and see if there is softness in these areas this strategy will give you a pretty good idea what it is your buying if you are buying from a private party and a bank or lending institution is not involved an appraisal or pest inspection will not be requried in most states be careful structual repairs are outrageous i provide services like that in my area and i have heard of some good ones don't believe anything anybody tells you about the structure if the seller is going to put a clause in the sales contract to reimburse you should there be problems then go for it in the meantime be very prudent feel free to contact me you might check the electrical box and see if there are the old type screw in fuses in most states the box needs to be updated prior to sale in some states if you buy it then try to sell the home you will be responsible to ensure that the home is up to the latest code for the area prior to sale turn on the water at various points inside the house and see whether the pipes bang that will tell you that they did not replace a simple thing like rubber washers in the faucets prior to sale in this instance you will have a better idea of what your seller is like be careful ask about when the pipes were replaced and what type pipe was utilized you can tell by looking in various points where the water has a valve called an angle stop take a utility knife and scrap the paint behind the valve to reveal the metal on the pipe if it's a brass color it will be replaced with copper tube and sweat soldered or metal color would denote galvanized make sure that there isn't pvc it's white like sprinkler lines this is bad good luck jim  Seismic retrofit Mattress Tire Electrical wiring Irrigation Thermal power station Straw-bale construction Bong Wood carving Poker jargon Wood Glossary of firefighting equipment Carburetor Basement Home repair Soldering Microeconomics Pottery Knife Hydraulic machinery Volleyball Hamster Fire extinguisher Upholstery Light-frame construction Printed circuit board Money Solar power Rail terminology Airsoft Glossary of firefighting terms Elevator Spark plug Radio controlled airplane IPod Diving cylinder Diamond Conker's Bad Fur Day Vacuum tube Violin Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Textile manufacturing Lathe Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Japanese toilet Overhead lines Insurance Monetary policy Kitchen Sento Strap-on dildo Craps Skateboarding trick Objective-C Christmas tree Guitar Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Lighting Short selling Stairway Wallpaper group William Murdoch Firefighter Furnace Woodworking Portsmouth Block Mills Solder Air-raid shelter Eifel Aqueduct Bus models used in New York City Transit Domestic rabbit Baseball Real estate broker Cheating in Counter-Strike Gramophone record Diving regulator Equine conformation Carbon dioxide Dodge Charger Roof Internal ballistics Welding Fuse (electrical) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Corrosion Aluminium Bulk vending Liquid crystal display Scientology beliefs and practices Milton H.

why are lp liquid propane tanks usually painted silver i just read some of your other responses active imaginations indeed truth is the tank is stainless steel it has a welded bead all around the tank on both ends the top and where the feel are attached once the tank has been air pressure tested which is done with high air pressure and soap and water bubbles if there is a hole or weak spot the tank is dried off and sent over to be painted the only reason the tank is painted silver is because most tanks are going to business concerns and they require silver color the tank can be painted any color but from the manufactuer they are silver to reduce cost and only provide it in silver like henry ford once said you can order your car in whatever color you want as long as its black  Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Carbon dioxide Siphon Welding Space Shuttle external tank Carburetor Hydrogen economy Apollo Command/Service Module Dodge Charger Corrosion Thermal power station Brewery Fuel injection Ford Motor Company Fire fighting Casting Titanium E85 Aluminium Diving cylinder Seismic retrofit Saturn V Fire extinguisher Automobile Gas turbine Glossary of firefighting equipment Bong Solar power Brazing Tire Manganese Silver Energy development Fossil fuel power plant Henry Ford Ford Model T Soldering Rebreather Space shuttle main engine Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Rocket fuel Water purification Tiger I Motorcycle Tank De Lorean DMC-12 STS-51-L Ford Crown Victoria Decompression sickness Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Rail terminology Inkjet printer Pioneer Zephyr Petroleum Apollo 6 Fire hydrant Hot air balloon Naval mine Dishwasher Oxyacetylene Explosive material Cookware and bakeware Tank car Drill bit Dodge Neon Helium Dry cleaning Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter B-47 Stratojet Car handling Dairy School bus Vacuum Nuclear power Portable stove Passenger car Space Shuttle program Mattress Apollo 13 Yohoho!

can you move a septic tank access point i just recently bought a house in queens ny and realized that the access point for the septic tank was located inside the basement is it necessary to have an access point for the septic tank can i move it outside to the backyard do i need a permit from the city and what's the cost range for all this work appreciate any answers thanks the access point you refer to is actually the top of the septic tank think in terms of a small lid on a big box why would you want to move the access point maybe you are referring to the clean out t which is connected inline to the either waste main that runs to your septic tank to move the acces point or door it would encompass a tunnel of sorts out of conrete or another type of hardened material the idea being that you could access the septic for the express purpose of a septic dump sometimes when the tank has become inoperative due to various reasons you would call a septic tank type company to have your septic tank emptied the symtoms for having that performed is that the tolits won't flush or that they'll back up the tank works on a micro biological level the micro organisims in the waste actually break down other wastes if this process is interrupted the septic will quit functioning it is true that if you add yeast to the system such as rid x it will help kep the micro processes alive bleach direct undiluted is the worst for the system as it nuetralizes the process when the septic tank is cleared or emptied the service company will remove the door to access the tank insert a flexible hose from hell and start the process if you move the access door you would need to encompass a parameter that the hose could be feed by hand to accomodate this process the one aspect that could not be accomplished is to move the door and still have a visual on the tank keep in mind that the tank is also connected to a series of leach lines usually these are lines with various holes in them that distribute the waste water into the ground in what they call a leach field if you moved your septic tank you would also need to move or divert the leach lines as well or install new ones these are trenches that are about wide and about feet deep layed in gravel and sand and run anywhere from to feet depending on how big the house is the federal title talks about it it starts with sand in the leach field followed by the gravel then the pipe then the reverse of the material and then the fill dirt on top the down side of moving the leach lines is that most building departments or city planning offices will not allow concrete structures or concrete anything directly over such leach fields anytime that you are working with the septic system a permit from your jurisdiction is required at the hall of records whether it s the city county parish or whatever is a map of the location of the septic tank just as you just bought the property and didn't know where it was you could inquire with them and they would tell you where it was located a new system would be upwards of in your area good luck jim  Septic tank Autonomous building Seismic retrofit Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Irrigation Brewery Domestic water system Sewage treatment Electrophysiology Glossary of firefighting terms Drill bit Basement Casting Flush toilet Glossary of firefighting equipment Land mine Thermal power station Compiler optimization Air-raid shelter New York City Subway Poker jargon Rail terminology CPU cache Toilet paper Windows 2000 Computer MDAC E85 Mach kernel Airport Floppy disk Drainage Combine (Half-Life 2) Ammunition Cable television Sewer Solar power Elevator Linked list Composting toilet Trench warfare Dairy Windows XP Fire fighting Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Wind turbine Kitchen Expert system Nuclear power Microeconomics Dog agility ALGOL 68 Water purification Bong Anchor West Side Highway Rapid transit C programming language Sea-Monkey Electrical wiring Geodesic dome Marine aquarium Dialysis Corrosion Glossary of American football Canal lock Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Concrete M60 machine gun MTR Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Vacuum cleaner King City, Ontario Hard disk Semiconductor TGV Rebreather IRT Flushing Line Abortion Spring operating system Toronto Subway and RT Nuclear reactor Scuba set Glossary of wildland fire terms Biodiesel Loudspeaker

major pool issues please help before i melt timeline filter became clogged i didnt notice rained for a few days checked the pool and realized it was bright green shocked it green color left but water is still cloudy shocked it again still cloudy added cups of bleach still cloudy help what you need is a slime bag to clear up your pool water no i'm not calling you names a slime bag installed on the outlet where water is pumped back into the pool will have your water cleared up overnight dead algae is what is clouding up the water i had this same thing happen to me two summers ago and after days of cleaning and changing filter elements i still couldn't see much improvement i ordered a slime bag over the internet installed it and by the next morning i could barely see any cloudiness by the end of the day the water was crystal clear definitely take a water sample to your nearby pool supply store so they can test it and tell you what adjustments to make to the chemicals to get the right balance however while you are there ask them if they carry slime bags not scum balls most likely you should get the polishing or xtra polishing slime bag the slime bag filters particles down to micron whereas sand filters might filter out microns cartridge filters go down to only about microns and de filters get down to only about microns if they don't have them then you can locate a dealer by going to the http www cleanerpools net or do a search on slime bag and see who has the best deal online the cost for the polishing slime bag is about which sounds high but since you can rinse them out and use them over and over they will last quite a while  Brewery Water purification Solar power Dishwasher Textile manufacturing Coffee Marine aquarium Sun Sewage treatment Cloud The Ark in Space Motor oil Bong Biodiesel Tea Dialysis Dairy Agar plate Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Technicolor Vacuum cleaner Opportunity rover Fountain Internet Sake Hard disk Liquid crystal Diamond Renewable energy Nuclear reactor Hydrogen USS Trigger (SS-237) Solar cell Nutrient Weather lore Illegal drug trade Ice core Carburetor Pebble bed reactor Lake Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Windows XP Super Nintendo Entertainment System Welding Solar variation Phase-locked loop E-mail spam Incandescent light bulb Drainage Polarization Huygens probe Glass Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Digital Subscriber Line Titan (moon) The Curse of Fenric Antarctic krill Wind power Dry cleaning Fossil fuel power plant Use of poison gas in World War I Diseases of the honeybee Climate of the United Kingdom M16 (rifle) Radon Jet engine Eutrophication Yerba mate Explosive material Siphon Internal ballistics Liquid crystal display Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Sea ice Mercury Atlas 6 Cryptosporidium Hardware random number generator Tofu Elis Prefecture Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Ammunition Van Halen Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Snooker Nintendo 64 Manicure Federal Standard 1037C Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Laserdisc Autonomous building Impact crater Helium Plastic Hydrogen economy

i moved into a newly built house weeks ago the central air is not flowing evenly thru house any suggestion get the contractor back in and have him balance it under warranty failing that make sure the filter is not clogged with construction dust do a make shift balance by closing down the grills in the rooms getting to much air this will cause air noise at the grills so this is a temporary measure once you get it fairly balanced you will want to take notice of where the damper position of each grill is e g closed closed etc get a piece of duct board pressed fiberglass or styrofoam insulation at your favorite home center with the air off remove the grill from each register box that has the grill closed more that cut a piece of the duct board to snugly fit the side of the register box where the air duct is cut into it measure the hole in the register box for the duct for my example i am going to assume that the register on the box was closed and the duct size was inches once you have a piece of ductboard that fits snugly over the opening for the duct remove it and cut a hole through it equal to open percentage i e if the grill was closed it is open so we cut a hole of inches which equals diameter i realize this is not of the area this is the way that it works insert the ductboard over the hole in the register box reinstall grill with the damper full open repeat for all the grills closed or more you should have a fairly even temperature through the house now good luck  Drill bit HVAC Bong Thermal power station Gramophone record Spark plug Loudspeaker Printed circuit board Screw Tire Furnace Opportunity rover Carburetor Propeller Dundas Square Door Casting Flute Jet engine Glass Transformer Fume hood Window Entropy Brewery Action potential Radio controlled airplane Dog agility Seismic retrofit Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Air conditioning Polystyrene Table saw Carbon dioxide Semiconductor Kasparov versus The World Diamond Knife Explosive material Panama Canal Locks Passive solar Two-stroke cycle Ozone depletion Movie projector Textile manufacturing Space shuttle main engine Diving suit Fiberglass Shoe Fossil fuel power plant Upholstery Baroque chess Ice core Vacuum Glossary of firefighting equipment Diode Dialysis Ozone hole View camera Piano Hard disk Betting (poker) Semiconductor device Stairway Solar power Coffin Floppy disk STS-114 Wind turbine Equine conformation B-47 Stratojet Internal ballistics E85 Nose flute Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Wrench Anemometer Clarinet Sun Turbofan Cello Punt (boat) Diving regulator Kitchen Kidney Wood carving Rathfarnham Table tennis Glossary of partner dance terms Bicycle frame Textile manufacturing terminology Jennings Randolph Lake Straw-bale construction Duct tape Hubble Space Telescope Wood

connecting one antenna to two tvs how do i connect one hd antenna to two tv's i think i may need a pair of diplexers but don't know why i need them or how to use them you need a splitter which is available at most electronic parts stores radio shack and probably where you bought the antenna pay attention to the markings on the splitter so that the antenna is connected to the right connector on the splitter or it won't work very well be aware though that if you live in a fringe area using a splitter will further reduce the signal strength since the power is split between two television sets in this case it may be better to use a wide band amplifier with multiple outputs  Television Antenna (radio) SCART Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Coaxial cable Cable television Crystal radio receiver Decibel Oscilloscope Transmitter Satellite dish Impedance matching Software-defined radio Amateur radio Electronic amplifier Transformer Radar Digital television Wi-Fi Digital Visual Interface S__CAM Communications satellite Digital Subscriber Line Cavity magnetron Universal Serial Bus Low-noise block converter Jack plug Global System for Mobile Communications VFO Operational amplifier Electronics Amplitude modulation Phased array Low-pass filter TV-FM DX Diode Microphone Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Amstrad CPC TGV XLR connector Citizens' band radio Circuit design DVD Receiver (radio) VHF omnidirectional range High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program Instrument amplifier Electronic filter RS-232 Direction finding Bluetooth History of radar Very Long Baseline Interferometry Advanced Technology Attachment Ethernet Theremin Transistor S-Video Longwave RFID IEEE 802.11 Central processing unit Air traffic control Frequency synthesiser Phase-locked loop Mixing console WWVB Satellite television STS-61 Television licence Original Amiga chipset Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Vacuum tube Kenwood Electronics Amplifier Digital camera Michelson-Morley experiment Mediumwave Atari 8-bit family Low-power broadcasting Radio Ultra high frequency Electrophysiology Capacitor Set-top box High-definition television Galileo spacecraft MPEG-4 Part 3 Apollo Command/Service Module Xbox Effective radiated power Home Box Office RCA connector Scanner (radio) PID controller

best way to lay a loft floor i am just about to board my loft any special way to do it and what should i watch out for do i needed planning permission just to lay a floor for storage purpose only you do not need planning to lay boards on a loft floor you will need to place the boards crossways over the joists depending on your skill level it might be beneficial if you cut the tongue and groove off the boards using a circular saw otherwise if you need to get to electtics and pipes you will have a job try and avoid having the end of the board hanging in mid air ideally the end of the board should rest halfway on the joist have fun o  Stairway Timber framing Plywood Kitesurfing Platform framing Basement Wood carving Electrical wiring Japanese tea ceremony Loft Seismic retrofit Skateboarding trick Radio controlled airplane Universal Serial Bus Volleyball Darts Kitchen Portsmouth Block Mills Temporal bone St. Raphael's Cathedral (Dubuque) White House Lighting Aerial (dance move) P-61 Black Widow Political subdivisions of New York State File system Bungalow Star Trek: Enterprise Minimum wage Golf glossary Deck (ship) CPU cache Elevator Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Glossary of firefighting equipment Sonic the Hedgehog 2 RuneScape skills Tongue Mattress Dance Dance Revolution Dundas Square Spline (mathematics) Gramophone record Zoning Tire Drill bit Boarding school Apollo 8 Golf club (equipment) Minneapolis, Minnesota Golf Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Maxilla Bristol Grammar School Textile manufacturing Door King George V School Militarisation of space Furnace Kansai International Airport Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Pump It Up Energy development Dial M for Murder Franklin W.

my zanussi washing machine leaks when filling up help i have checked for blockages and cannot find one any ideas would be welcome i just checked the hose no kink break i took the top off the machine no visible problems there checked the door seal a slight crack on this is this what it could be if so is it easy to replace okay further inspection done no crack on the door seal the leak is coming from underneath the machine so i guess a seal is broke or there is a pump hose problem everywhere else seems intact it's difficult to know what to put here as the machine has always been fine keep putting suggestions to me though points up for grabs if we take what you say literally that it leaks when filling up and not at any other time then i would say take the top off and look at the short rubber pipe that runs from the water solenoid valve where your external blue red pipe connects to the soap box where you put the soap powder this is the only hose that is only pressurised when filling up also look at the big convoluted rubber hose which carries the water soap powder mix from the soap box into the tub the tub is the big round stationary part that holds the water inside which the drum is mounted water soap powder mix runs down this hose into the machine when filling only both of these can be inspected by removing only the top panel of the washing machine these are the only two places where you will find water only while filling if on the other hand you are misleading us and in fact the machine continues to leak once filling is completed then that's another story and you'll have to look underneath to find the source of dripping water maybe you will see why it is important to be as accurate and specific as possible when asking these kinds of questions go on put some effort into it additional information now you're on the right track stand the machine on some blocks so you can look underneath while the machine is filling up you will see where the water's coming from and you can replace the relevant hose seal or part forget cracks in the drum tub or other catastrophic failure my bet is it'll be something simple and yes you can do it yourself then you'll have done it yourself and you don't need our help well done  Casting Hydraulic machinery Menstrual cup Diving regulator Glossary of firefighting equipment Fire extinguisher Textile manufacturing Bong Electrophysiology Cruising (maritime) Glossary of firefighting terms Irrigation Glossary of wildland fire terms Fire fighting Combine (Half-Life 2) Seismic retrofit Rail terminology Dairy Siphon Washing machine Flush toilet Dishwasher Borehole Poker jargon CPU cache Dialysis Vacuum tube M60 machine gun Coffee Rebreather Mach kernel Diving cylinder STS-61 B-47 Stratojet Dishwashing Bullet Fire hydrant Home repair Drill bit Plastic Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Scuba set Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory M16 (rifle) Novelty (locomotive) Energy development MS-06 Zaku II Handloading Skateboarding trick Japanese toilet The Time Machine Pebble bed reactor Intravenous therapy Brewery Steam engine Thermostat Dodge Neon Slot machine Suppressor Naval mine Soap opera Mercury 4 Laundry Sento Condom String theory Vacuum cleaner Oscilloscope Heinkel He 100 Pump Loudspeaker Table tennis Diamond Space disaster Collision detection Customs and etiquette of Japan Diseases of the honeybee Spark plug Elevator Fast bowling Headlight Krag-J__rgensen Fujian tea ceremony Radar War of the Worlds (2005 film) Top-bar hive Typewriter

why is my walk in cooler freezing up every day either the thermostat has went bad or the defrost system isnt working should have a timed defrost which causes the system to pump down and then it has electric heater which warms the coils to melt off any ice after a preset time the timer restarts the system then the thermostat controls how cold it should get  Refrigerator HVAC Solar power Air conditioning Furnace Autonomous building Slow cooker Cooler Hysteresis Apollo 13 Bi-metal Phase change heat pump Deep lake water cooling Radiator Aquarium Heating element Ice Soldering iron Honda Prelude Carburetor Diesel engine Coffee Timer Rice cooker Heat Water (molecule) Home repair Carbon dioxide Embedded system Thermocouple Thunderstorm Stirling engine Winter storm Little Ice Age The Day After Tomorrow Severe weather terminology (United States) Fog Climate of the United Kingdom Philip J.

sliding glass door help alright i have a solid wood not sure what kind anderson door that was installed somewhere between and it is double paned a dog chewed on it previous owner and i patched it with wood filler no structural damage hardware needs replacing and i think the weather strips they are hard may need replaced if i can figure out how it is a standard footer one stationary side we can afford to spend no more than dollars on a replacement can i just repair this door do you think and all or should i go down to a vinyl on the anderson website the series looks like ours and it is like so no way we can rebuy the same door i just live in iowa and it gets cold as all heck here and so i need to do something before winter if i can repair it that is that goes towards my kitchen so you see why i want to if possible it seems the andersen web site is down at the moment so i can't give you links to the specifics but a few notes you can get any part you need for this door there are pictures with part numbers on their site under service to help you identify what you need in the way of weatherstrip if memory serves correctly the weatherstrip on these units is a rigid vinyl so unless you see parts broken off it may be ok if you do need to replace it is not difficult the replacements will have instructions that are easy to follow with minimal skill replacing the panel is the most expensive part of your problems a new panel will be in the range of depending upon the type of glass in the panel and the discounts offered in your region andersen hardware has a year warranty if the door was purchased toward the end of the range you mentioned it may still be covered the hardware warranty does not cover finish wear nor would it cover damage but if the hardware is otherwise broken it is worth looking into you should find a local dealer to help you with parts when you call or visit them you will need the visible glass size of the unit measure just the part of the glass you can see the exterior and interior colors and the information etched around the andersen logo in one corner of the glass with the logo information they can tell which type of glass is in the unit and the year it was manufactured repairing the door would be much preferred to replacing it with vinyl the andersen door will perform much better than a vinyl slider and will add to or in this case retain the value of your home the parts especially the panel are expensive but replacing parts is much easier than changing the whole door i would not under any circumstances try to fit a generic weatherstrip to an andersen door the factory parts will do a much better job and look much nicer a bit more expensive but worth it in the long run the andersen site is back up now so have a look at http www andersenwindows com homeowner pdfs frenchwood gliding pdf caution pdf file may take a few minutes there is a diagram on page showing each of the weatherstrip pieces it would be helpful to print this page and circle the parts you need also looking there i see that most of the weatherstrip is rigid with rubber pieces inside so it is normal for the outside pieces to be hard there should be a softer rubber piece inside if this is missing then you do need new weatherstrip  Mattress Gramophone record Drill bit Plastic CPU cache Laserdisc Tire Floppy disk De Lorean DMC-12 Compiler optimization Billiards Redundant array of independent disks Casting Digital photography Ford Cortina Seismic retrofit Natural Selection (computer game) Virtual memory Beatmania IIDX Commodore 64 Windows 2000 Inflation Pump It Up Apple Computer Microeconomics Atari 8-bit family Windows Vista Solar power C programming language Toyota Prius Color Computer Motorcycle Bicycle lighting Imperial (automobile) Stereoscopy Violin Digital circuit Autorack Car body style World Wide Web Strap-on dildo Welding Car handling BASIC programming language Vinyl roof Stairway Computer virus Linked list Condom Transformer Japanese tea ceremony Dance Dance Revolution Electrophysiology Common Unix Printing System Radio controlled airplane Bus models used in New York City Transit Compact disc HTML element Arcade cabinet Central processing unit View camera Circuit design Marching band Digital rights management Mac OS X Elevator Volkswagen Type 2 Diving suit Amstrad CPC STS-114 Dog agility Sento Universal Serial Bus Wallpaper group Incandescent light bulb Warranty Ford Mustang Musical Instrument Digital Interface Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Porsche 911 Mainframe computer Cube (film) E85 Overclocking Phonograph cylinder IPod

has anyone given any thought about the bacteria that may be present in the water line of refrigerators i'm moving up in the world yes i have my first fridge with an automatic ice maker i live alone i don't use that much ice a thought occured to me the water from the plumbing in the kitchen goes through a flimsy plastic tubing that runs to the fridge i know there is a vaccum effect but the water remains in the line until there is a demand from the icemaker some of it may be there for weeks in my case is there a condition of vaccum sufficient enough to keep bacteria from breeding is it the same as buying bottled water considering shelf life and all that what do you think i would also like to hear from people who also know and their sources just one more thing to worry about in our overly cautious and neurotic society lol thanks you do sound a little neurotic here there is chlorine in the water that will prevent most bacteria from developing there is also no air in the water that the bacteria can thrive on unless it is anaerobic bacteria but in any case once the water hits your freezer the cold temperature will kill anything in it so stop worrying and start enjoying your ice  Refrigerator Sewage treatment Air conditioning Water purification Food preservation Foodborne illness Water Ice cream Escherichia coli O157:H7 Swimming Bacteria Ozone Tofu Botulism Autonomous building Acetic acid Agar plate Solar power Compost Sulfur Swimming pool Milk Ozone depletion Bong Coffee Domestic water system Carbon dioxide Ammonia Intravenous therapy Ozone hole Sea-Monkey Ice Energy development Vacuum Food storage Disinfection Brewery Sea ice Chlorine Permian-Triassic extinction event Dairy Kitchen Acne Pneumonia Ice core HVAC Anthrax Carburetor Soil life Geyser Motility Photosynthesis Sterilization (microbiology) Planet of the Daleks Aquarium Alkane Diseases of the honeybee Renewable energy Haloalkane Alternative biochemistry Plumbing fixture Drowning Equine conformation Carnivorous plant Siphon Rum Anaerobic digestion Stirling engine Cruising (maritime) E85 Fire fighting Plastic Bottled water Urinal Fog Refrigeration Slow cooker Water (molecule) Wine making Lake Exploration of Mars Organic food Cellular respiration Cholera Dialysis Halitosis Common cold Microwave oven Vermicompost Hard disk Methane Body piercing Hong Kong-style milk tea Paleoclimatology Mars Abiogenic petroleum origin Severe weather terminology (United States) Menstrual cycle

my option regarding rebuild fences with neighbour my neighbour wants to rebuilt the fence between our houses which i don't completely agree what my choices are i think its stupid to require of the cost and share ownership its kinda like shared driveways its almost guaranteed to cause problems how much to spend what materials what color it is going to be major conficts and yes you can try to work it out and perhaps it will but some people are just set in their ways not to mention who gets what side facing their yard and when it needs fixing how do they split the bill what if they want to do it themselves but the other wants a contractor if theres problems with the fence who calls the contractor what if after the construction begins who does the contractor listen to soo many questions i would write to the city certified mail or take it up there personally get the name of the person who is in charge and tell them the situation if they want a fence built let them assume the cost and make sure it is properly set back away from the property line called a setback if the fence is on the property line write and request what they call a variance this will allow you to use property which it was not originally set for and they must set the fence back a certain amount of feet from the property line this is the best way and you are more than likely to get along with the neighbor allot better by each getting what they want everything in these days must be in writing and you have to keep notes now that you got whos in charge call couple days later and talk to this person ask him what can be done if they won't grant you a variance request a public meeting so you can be heard if that person dont' get you somewhere then write to their boss keep going until your satisfied yes this is work but will save aggrivation in long run i doubt there will be problems with grant to variance but better prepared than not if you do decide to go with the fence get everything in writing regarding my questions above dont assume nothing  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Poker jargon CPU cache Risk management SCO-Linux controversies Bush v.

whats wrong with my houses airconditioning the upstairs and downstairs temperatures are way different to get a decent temperature upstairs you have to set it to freezing which makes the bottom floor unbearably cold when the bottom floor is the percect temperature the top floor is way to hot whats wrong if it is a central air conditioning unit meaning it has cold air coming out of the vents on the floor or wall then close the vents off down stairs a little this will force the airflow upstairs to even it out if it's a wall or window a c then try putting it in an upstairs window cold air falls and hot air rises but in the case of one window a c you are dealing with extreme heat in one location and extreme cold in another i suppose if the thing is cold enough to be freezing then you might even be able to use a fan downstairs and a fan upstairs to circulate the air good luck  HVAC Stairway Solar power Air conditioning Hot air balloon Furnace Diving suit Fire fighting Thermoregulation Climate of the United Kingdom Thermostat Thermal power station Bristol Grammar School Brewery Carburetor Basement Desert Temperature Upstairs, Downstairs Hyperthermia Severe weather terminology (United States) Jet engine The Star Wars Holiday Special McMansion Lift (force) Water (molecule) Teen Girl Squad Computer cooling Turbofan Diseases of the honeybee Axial compressor Deep lake water cooling Motor oil Water Firestorm Autonomous building Sento Wind Weather lore Fuzzy logic GunZ The Duel Nuclear fusion Heat The Brady Bunch Insulation Fan death Geyser Forge Seismic retrofit Spark plug Trombe wall Radon Lighting Convection Fog Mr. Freeze Pacific Ocean Engine cooling Central heating Saturday Night Live Sea ice Glossary of firefighting terms Ocean thermal energy conversion World War Three (Doctor Who) Two-stroke cycle Degree Fahrenheit Swamp cooler Radiator Urban heat island Poker jargon Professional wrestling throws Passive solar Casting RMS Titanic Chimney Dance Dance Revolution Atlantic Ocean Zoning Dodge Neon Marathon (computer game) Climate of India Carbon dioxide Fan (implement) Ice cream Chatsworth House Bread Ice Thunderstorm Scramjet Steam engine Blood (computer game) Kitchen Meteorology Cryogenics Fossil fuel power plant Piccolo Junior Saga Exploration of Mars Cold fusion Houseplant The Midnight Sun

i need an odorless paint i am getting ready to attempt a first time do it myself interior paint job in my apartment any help or advice would be much appreciated i am trying to figure out if there is an odorless paint on the market i can purchase for this project due to my children being in the home when i am painting if there is such paint where do i find it once i find it what kind should i get glossy matte satin is price the only difference or is quality an issue what type of paint is it that you notice pealing off like dead skin that kind i surely don't want to use will any brand of paint be okay to use purchased at a discount store like big lots i am not looking for perfection or a million dollar appearance just want to get rid of the pastel green walls thanks for your time and help first of all odorless paint won't happen go with a good latex interior paint latex paint odors will not harm you or your kids there are some drying agents in the paint but they are strictly regulated a safe bet is to talk to an expert at a paint store and read the cautions on the can children with breathing problems shouldn't be in the same room you are painting only as a precaution the smell of an interior latex paint won't hurt you it is very non toxic the oil based and exterior paints are the ones to really be carefull with it will cost between and you can get cheaper paint at to but their ability to cover in one coat is limited you will end up spending twice as much time to put two coats on with cheap paint surface and peeling if you are concerned about peeling check the codition of the original surface you want to cover if it is a gloss you will want to make sure you pre treat the surface to allow the new paint to bond ask at a paint store places like home depot etc have people working and giving advise that have just learned it out of books or not at all paint stores or paint sections should have a surface prep you can use to wash the gloss next if the surface is dirty you should clean it too if it is overly dirty marked up etc you can prime the wall a good bond coat primer like zinser bullseye paint will cover dirty walls and will create a bond coat with gloss paints where you then won't need the gloss prep if you don't have glossy walls and the walls are clean you can use a good latex paint to cover the green remember the darker the color you are using the more coats you will need with kids anything other than flat is a good choice flat will absorb dirty hand stains markers etc it's usually safe to use an eggshell paint  Paint Mattress Plastic Casting Tattoo Paintball Skin Solar power Wal-Mart Solar cell Commodity markets Primer (paint) Inflation Microeconomics Theory of conduct Diving suit Guinea pig Water Drawing Condom Social rule Sulfur Plame affair Upholstery Bulk vending Hamster Illegal drug trade Strap-on dildo Arbitrage Japanese tea ceremony Bong Fancy rat Glass Diamond CPU cache Breastfeeding Dry cleaning One Tree Hill (TV series) Gold standard Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Betting (poker) Japanese toilet First aid Cannabis cultivation Explosive material Dairy The Apprentice 2 Mutual fund Lionel Corporation Daredevil Intellectual property Coffee The Catcher in the Rye Glaze Chewing gum Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Tesco Fluorescent lamp Wassily Kandinsky Goldfinger Wood carving FairTax Psoriasis Gross domestic product Acne Sento Leather Color Publicly funded medicine Filling station Oral sex Poker jargon Sears Holdings Corporation Human sexual behavior Fecal incontinence Food and Drug Administration Monetary policy Digital photography Free trade Automobile Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Computer Stomach cancer Economy of Russia Francis Bacon (painter) Nuclear power Hemp Xenon Drill bit

i just bought a house with yellow vinyl siding how durable if i change it's color to white thank you do i still need to prime it first you can paint vinyl siding but wont' outlast the original color obviously one good thing your doing is keeping to a lighter color dark colors are bad and vinyl already conducts alot of heat and darker color will just add to this conduction another characteristic is that is contracts and expands rapidly when you paint vinyl you can but not recommended to use traditional latex paints traditional paint will only last few years if that you need acrylic in the paint mixed with urethane helps the paint expand with the siding and are best to use to get the best bond you have to clean the siding this means soap and hard work if you prefer a pressure washer can be used but it won't get all the grime and it can force water behind the siding if you do use a pressure washer clean from top angle spraying down to reduce the water infiltration remove all mildew with oxygen bleach this won't hurt the vegetation and ground water around it can use bleach rinse well or paint will not stick do not paint in direct sun causes exessive drying you do not need a primer and dont' recommend because the surface is basicly already primed the primer is just like traditional paint and may not contain the urethane resin needed to expand and could actually harm your new paint regardless if you use the proper top coat but coats of paint is necessary for a complete job it will last about years if done properly  Paint Plastic Casting Mattress Epoxy Upholstery Primer (paint) Bong Manicure Dishwasher Brewery Tattoo Laser engraving Acrylic paint Sewage treatment Lacquer Textile manufacturing Spark plug Coffee Aluminium Internal ballistics Motor oil Gesso Menstrual cup Color theory Car washing techniques Washing machine Pottery Carburetor Cookware and bakeware Campfire Sodium hypochlorite Soap Wood Sento Titanium Ammonia Knife Drill bit Fancy rat Fire extinguisher Fire fighting Disinfection Bulk vending Stucco Tin Cast iron Japanese toilet Diamond Seismic retrofit Billiards Condom Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Water purification Thermal power station Tooth Acetic acid Gramophone record Motorcycle Friction Water (molecule) Water Hemp Varnish First aid Sunglasses Leather Hard water Soldering Paper marbling Rum Fluorescent lamp Carbon dioxide Solar power Corrosion Vinegar Wok Watercolor painting Wassily Kandinsky Sun Hard disk Pastel Drawing Car handling Dundas Square Handloading Garden Strawberry Heat Fuel injection Chromium

how can i tell how many hours per day my fridge runs i want to verify the power bill and check the house for leaks i don't know how good you are at working with electricity but here is an idea find the compressor motor and look at the wiring take an electric clock and cut the plug off of it wire the hot wire to the hot leg of the clock and tie the neutrals together set the clock to then when the motor starts running the time on the clock will move after hours take a reading on the clock then you will know the total time that the fridge ran if you aren't familiar with working with electricity then don't try this good luck  Residual-current device Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Electric motor Electricity meter Refrigerator Thermostat Spark plug Split phase Daylight saving time Computer bus Cray-1 STS-61 Reading spark plugs for racing Auto racing Central processing unit Magnetic field Elevator Axial compressor Rail terminology Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina RISC Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Toyota Prius Carburetor Alternating current Air conditioning Incandescent light bulb Vacuum tube Clock Fuel cell Time dilation Solar power Internal combustion engine Bombe Stirling engine Galileo spacecraft Baroque chess Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest USS S-37 (SS-142) Fan (implement) USS Tunny (SS-282) Frank Whittle Overhead lines Computer CPU design Perpetual motion Railway electrification system The Amazing Race Digital circuit 24-hour clock Diesel engine Mains electricity Hour Sundial Enigma machine National Electrical Code (US) Apollo 13 Equation of time Electric power Billboard Hot 100 Cruising (maritime) Honda B engine Ethernet Apollo Guidance Computer X10 (industry standard) Hydraulic machinery Wire wrap Digital Visual Interface Game clock Jet engine Paintball Gas compressor Ground and neutral Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Polyphase system RS-232 Electrical wiring (UK) Electrical generator Single-phase electric power Welding SMPTE time code Marian Rejewski Ground (electricity) Tire Advanced Technology Attachment Cable car (railway) New York Giants Lawn mower Railway signal Termina Hydrogen economy Ice hockey Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Automobile self starter CPU cache BS 1363 Baseball Battery electric vehicle

two sets of track lighting went out in the bedroom at the same time fuse is fine outlets in room work i am assuming the problem is with the light switch any other thoughts on what might cause both sets of lights per set to go out at the same time i also checked the bulbs they are fine it is probably the switch but you need to remember that the tracks are the wiring that transmits the electricity to the lights also the outlets may be on a different breaker if you are an electrician or know how to test electrical circuits you could test to see if there is current leaving the switch after the switch is energized then you should test the connections and the tracks themselves also test the connections where the lights connect with the tracks you should do this with a continuity tester if you are not used to working with vac if you are not experience with electrical circuits call someone who knows how to test them do not electrocute yourself  Residual-current device Switch Three-phase electric power Relay Circuit breaker National Electrical Code (US) Electrical wiring (UK) Oscilloscope BS 1363 Lineman (occupation) Alternating current Electrician Digital circuit Vacuum tube Distribution board Electric motor Overhead lines Electricity Incandescent light bulb Transformer Tesla coil Power strip Diode Ring circuit George Westinghouse Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Battery (electricity) Logic gate Railway signal Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Fluorescent lamp Dimmer Telephone exchange RS-232 Thermal power station High-voltage direct current Light-emitting diode X10 (industry standard) Electrical network Transmitter High-voltage hazards Split phase Fire alarm control panel Electrical wiring Central processing unit Mouse (computing) Transistor Short circuit Circuit design Burglar alarm TGV Thomas Edison Light switch Enigma machine Headlight Ohm's law Spark gap Thermostat Lightning Ethernet Ground (electricity) Inductor Electric power transmission Charles Wheatstone Integrated circuit Electrodeless lamp Ground and neutral Hall effect Switched-mode power supply Loudspeaker Electrical generator Nikola Tesla Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Electric chair Capacitor Musical Instrument Digital Interface Maxwell's equations Circuit switching Bombe Apollo Guidance Computer Wardenclyffe Tower Telephone Audiophile Digital Electrophysiology Green Line (MBTA) Field-programmable gate array Impedance matching Voltmeter World Columbian Exposition Printed circuit board Amateur telescope making Lighting Earthing system Rail terminology Particle accelerator Directed-energy weapon

central air conditioner not cooling house we live in the country in ks we have no shade trees our home is a double wide manufactured home on a permanent foundation it doesn't have high ceilings and only floor the problem is the house gets hot during the day even though the ac is running at p m it is still about degrees in here i just think the ac isn't working quite right any suggestions i appreciate all the advise i thought i'd add some additional details because we are out in the country we have taken in a number of stray dogs and cats they are indoor and outdoor animals so lots of shedding so we change the air filter very frequently great info on the freon lines husband went out small line was warm not hot and large line has small amount of frost on it we are planting trees this fall we will go get lattice to make a shelter for the unit house is about sq ft have to search for info on size of ac put thermometers against vents after min temps are and digital says but may take longer to register it doesn't go down into the vent any other recommendations will be appreciated thanks if you believe that the air is moving sufficiently inside let's check the outside unit first feel the air coming out of the unit you should feel heat being removed from the house next look at the freon lines there will be a big one and a little one the little one may be very hot so be careful the big one is the low pressure side and on normal conditions where the pipe is exposed should be cold a sweaty from this big line you can tell alot you will have to find a place where the insulation is off or right where it goes into the outside unit if it is frosted up then go to if not go to this could be due to either insufficient air flow across the coils of the inside unit or low freon which will cause the coil to start freezing if there is frost cut the unit off at the thermostat by switching the heat cool switch to off and turn the fan switch from auto to on this will cause the fan to continue running and turn off the compressor outside leave it this way for a minimum of minutes see if you notice the air flow to improve coming out of the vents while it is off you can check your air filters and make sure they are clean replace if necessary later turn the a c thermostat back to cool notice if it cools better and monitor the big line if after about five minutes the line is cool to cold then the freon level may be ok and you should feel hot air coming out of the unit if it is only barely cool or not cool the unit is probably low on freon if the big line is not cool and the little line is not warm then either you are very low on freon or your compressor isn't running either way you will need to get an ac repairman for repairs  Air conditioning Refrigerator Thermal power station Carburetor HVAC Solar power Jet engine Axial compressor Brewery Thermoregulation Haloalkane Transformer Carbon dioxide Turbocharger Fire fighting Spark plug Stirling engine Mattress E85 Seismic retrofit Heinkel He 100 Dairy Cray-1 Water (molecule) Furnace Mercury Atlas 6 Climate of the United Kingdom Severe weather terminology (United States) Loudspeaker Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Supercharger Wind power Lighting Dialysis Bong Phase change heat pump Drill bit Fan (implement) Welding Gas compressor Electric motor Poker jargon Nuclear power Hamster Equine conformation Pebble bed reactor Sun Energy development Basement Cannabis cultivation Dog Ocean thermal energy conversion Space Shuttle external tank Circuit breaker Diesel engine Turbojet Passive solar Coffee Central processing unit Temperature Sento Internal combustion engine First aid Tesla coil Volleyball Gas metal arc welding Avalanche Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Gas turbine Superconductivity Engine cooling Hydrogen economy Hypothermia Turbofan Explosive material Eldfell Hard disk Hyperthermia Fluorescent lamp Heat exchanger Rebreather 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Frost Dodge Neon Fossil fuel power plant Swimming pool Dundas Square The Midnight Sun Ice Gramophone record Wind

my basement floor was poured in two sections and the seam leaks when we get heavy rain any ideas to fix there is no good fix for this problem they should have installed a waterstop and key along the joint but they obviously didn't you could chip out a section on either side of the joint dowel in some rebar add a section of hydrophylic water stop it expands when it gets wet and re pour the concrete back my other suggestion would be to cut in a sump along where the joint is and install a sump pump with a float direct the discharge outside away from the foundation preferrably so it drains away from the house this will minimize the amount of water you get up through the crack a third suggestion would be to install the hydrophylic waterstop along the walls about to off the wall and pour a new lift of concrete to deep put a sheet of plastic down over the existing floor before you pour and make sure you pour it monolithically or that you key and waterstop any joints  Concrete Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Reinforced concrete Drill bit Air-raid shelter Upholstery Welding Panama Canal Dam Pile Drywall Thermal power station Whitewater Wind turbine Light-frame construction Motor oil Casting Panama Canal Locks Cave diving Portsmouth Block Mills Glossary of firefighting equipment Irrigation Sellafield Masonry Rail tracks Autonomous building Sewage treatment Glacier Clarinet Prestressed concrete Rebar Elevator Table saw Atari 8-bit family Domestic water system Straw-bale construction Mooney M20 Hoover Dam Mattress Rail terminology Solar power Hydroponics Passive solar Poker jargon Pavement (material) Fire fighting Equine conformation Flush toilet Screw Internal ballistics Soldering Bong Fire extinguisher Water (molecule) Textile manufacturing Apollo Command/Service Module Toilet paper Erie Canal Kitchen Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area Natural building Le Corbusier Keynesian economics Brewery Electrical wiring Town gas Portland cement Israeli West Bank barrier Cruising (maritime) Building material Big Dig Orjen Debugging Jumpstart 3rd Grade Transistor Cookware and bakeware Urinal Plastic E85 Naval mine Cinder block Mercury 4 Bassoon Xanadu House Valles Marineris Oil platform Glass Boat building Carburetor Space elevator Air conditioning Diving De Lorean DMC-12 Glossary of firefighting terms Glossary of climbing terms Plumbing fixture

solar wind power has anyone installed solar panels wind tubine on the roof of their house yet my utility bills have increased yet again and i'm thinking of taking the plunge i was wondering just how much power these alterative systems can supply lay mans terms kettle tv computer tumble drier washing machine heating or will it be just a few light bulbs once a week can you make a profit by selling power back to the grid any positive coments would be greatly apprieciated there grid tie and non grid tie systems depending on what you desire to install a grid tied system is tapped into the power lines and feeds your unused energy back to the local power company for a credit balance on your electric bill a non grid tied system would not sell back your unused energy to the power company but would instead be a closed end system for your own use in this type of system you would want to have extra storage capability so as not to waste any captured energy the most efficient solar panels on the market as of current are efficient at capturing energy however new cells have just been invented that are as much as efficient meaning you can use less of them to be just as efficient also saving space grid tied systems will usually cost you k while non grid tied systems would cost you less to install your savings may differ depending on how many panels you install versus how much energy you consume so it's hard to estimate your monthly savings typically witihin grid tied systems your electric bill will be less than a month and you should be able to power everything in your home dryers washers refrigerators air conditioning heating etc  Solar cell Solar panel Autonomous building Wind power Future energy development Energy development Hybrid vehicle Hydrogen economy Electric power transmission Air conditioning Vacuum tube Fuel cell Transformer Power station Incandescent light bulb Grid energy storage Electric motor Nuclear power Solar power satellite Distributed generation Dairy Manitoba Hydro Electrical wiring Furnace Ocean thermal energy conversion Laptop Alcohol fuel Welding High-voltage direct current Diode Battery electric vehicle Spacecraft propulsion Sun Biodiesel Stirling engine Oscilloscope Fan (implement) Lighting Passive solar Three-phase electric power Alternative fuel Thermal power station Japanese toilet Pebble bed reactor Energy storage Washing machine Energy Policy Act of 2005 Electric boat Electric power Electrical generator Electricity meter Political economy Digital photography Turbocharger Colonization of the Moon Sewage treatment Alternating current Renewable energy development Tidal power Hydroelectricity Computer Brewery Optical fiber Steam engine Kitchen Urban heat island Nuclear power phase-out National Weather Service Tire HVAC Spark plug Microeconomics Hydrogen vehicle Nuclear reactor Hard disk Split phase Cruising (maritime) Electric vehicle Gas turbine Geomagnetic storm Embedded system Fusion power Economy of Russia Petroleum Monopoly Explosive material George Westinghouse Energy Electricity generation Credit card Natural gas

how do you get rid of mildew smell and dampness in the basement i just started working a new job and it is my job to clean the basement there are old carpets everywhere they literally fall apart when you touch them i'm going to start by getting rid of these but how get rid of some of the smell and dampness a dehumidifier will remove water but it will not get rid of enough to make a big difference if you wish to use the basement in any form of living quarters you will need to either install a vent with return from the existing central air conditioning system or use a separate window air conditioner if it is possible it will be pointless to attempt to remove the smell with any type of spray charcoal activated system or baking soda the only way to remove musty smells is to remove the source that being moisture  Air conditioning Basement HVAC Fire fighting Autonomous building Diving suit Rebreather Tofu Dehumidifier Sulfur Home repair Water purification Airbag Vinegar Thermal power station Cannabis cultivation Bong Fume hood Desiccation Thunderstorm Skunk Explosive material Water Volcanic ash Ice Solar power Kitchen Ventilation Honey Electrical wiring Upholstery Rain Menstrual cup Spyware Air pollution Swamp cooler Renewable energy Radon Hemp Dry cleaning Japanese toilet Carbon dioxide Mitsubishi 3000GT Battery (electricity) Irrigation Computer virus Angel One (TNG episode) B-47 Stratojet Sense File system Toxic mold Moss Ozone depletion Hydrogen peroxide Fog Wildfire Hydrogen chloride Diseases of the honeybee Acetic acid Casting Polyethylene terephthalate Houseplant Harmonic oscillator Frogman Charcoal Minor Discworld concepts Extreme Programming M16 (rifle) Urinal Loudspeaker Japanese tea ceremony Comfrey Skin Thermostat Ozone hole Barbecue M60 machine gun Flue gas desulfurization Copper extraction Ocean thermal energy conversion Glossary of firefighting equipment Mario series enemies Brewery Malware Carburetor Vacuum cleaner Nuclear fallout Scuba set Domestic water system Cookie Hydrogen sulfide Leblanc process Xanadu House Apollo Command/Service Module Fire extinguisher Common Unix Printing System Manchester Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Bread

a question for mobile home owners with an electric furnace how does an electric furnace compare with an oil furnace both in heating efficiency and overall costs as far as efficiency electric is tops percent of the money you spend on fuel gets used to heat the home none goes up a chimney the drawback is the cost of electric power is the most expensive if you have to go electric consider a heat pump you pay to move the heat but not the heat itself it also serves as an a c in summer heat pumps are only efficient when the weather is above and dry oil furnaces have come a long way in the past few years they are much more efficient cleaner burning and lower maintenance than in the past drawback is you pay quite a bit for fuel all at one time unless you are with a company that lets you spread payments out over the season the tank can also be an issue with some folks on the up side newer furnaces can burn bio diesel as for safety oil is actually diesel fuel it must be mixed with oxygen in order to burn there is little to no danger of uncontrolled fire from diesel oil fuel dollar for dollar oil is less expensive to operate  Diesel engine Hydrogen economy Solar power Coal Energy development Fuel injection Furnace Steam engine Future energy development Two-stroke cycle E85 Nuclear power Renewable energy Thermal power station Transformer Fossil fuel power plant Locomotive Alcohol fuel Hybrid vehicle Turbocharger Natural gas Carburetor Biodiesel Rocket fuel Tank Internal combustion engine Filling station High-speed rail Steel Pebble bed reactor Aircraft engine Fire Cogeneration Diesel Hydrogen vehicle Portable stove Solar cell Sewage treatment Wind turbine Biofuel Nuclear power phase-out Stove Autonomous building Diesel cycle Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Gasoline Fire fighting Wood fuel Kitchen Incandescent light bulb Carbon dioxide Cruising (maritime) Spacecraft propulsion Microeconomics Space shuttle main engine Glossary of firefighting terms Welding Automobile Fire extinguisher Cracking (chemistry) Wind power CANDU reactor Grid energy storage Iron Irrigation Economy of the United States Liquid fuels Sport utility vehicle Glossary of wildland fire terms Derbyshire lead mining history Spark plug Explosive material Air conditioning Fuel Incineration Electric vehicle Ceramics Space Shuttle program Blast furnace Apollo Command/Service Module Stirling engine Wildfire Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Heating oil Energy Policy Act of 2005 Gas turbine-electric locomotive Town gas Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Renewable energy development Implications of peak oil

is there any way i fix my ac power cord that my dog chewed on my dog chewed a few litte holes in it u can see the wires that is in it the cord goes to my laptop and it loses connection alot what can i use to fix this the idea is to make the electricity make a complete circuit to the laptop and back those holes where you can see the wires need to be repaired if for no other reason than to avoid getting shocked if the holes are very small and the wires don't appear to be damaged you can wrap black electrician's tape tightly around it to fix the holes if you suspect the wires are damaged you'll need to repair or replace the wire repair means cut the bad part out and reconnect the ends making sure you match the colors and that the wires are tightly twisted together and taped might be worth it to just replace the wire if it's badly damaged  Electrical wiring Wire wrap Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Knife Wire Transformer Drill bit Printed circuit board Laptop Jack plug Tire IPod Electrician Tesla coil D-subminiature Climbing equipment Naval mine PCB layout guidelines Stopping power BS 1363 Circuit design National Electrical Code (US) Fuse (electrical) Residual-current device Transistor Aluminium Electrical wiring (UK) Computer forensics Lineman (occupation) Spark plug Seismic retrofit Poker jargon Overhead lines Textile manufacturing terminology Welding Barbed wire Fancy rat Solar cell Thermostat Impedance matching Punch card Potentiometer Floppy disk Sound recording Power cable Liquid crystal display Universal Serial Bus Ground and neutral Computer bus Antenna (radio) Electric motor Three-phase electric power Ethernet Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Veroboard Key punch Screw Chewing gum Digital circuit Color Electrical generator Bassoon Professional wrestling match types Surveillance Switch Action potential Trapping Dog agility Overhead powerline Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Oscilloscope Hamster Inertial guidance system Tooth Dimmer Resistor Seismometer Geomagnetic storm Babe Ruth Galileo spacecraft Point-to-point construction Extension Cord Harp Ring circuit Enigma machine Computer Blasting cap Guitar Magnet Tobacco Internal ballistics Windows XP Hearing aid Disc brake Ferret Telephone Battery (electricity) Atari 8-bit family Loudspeaker

how do i determine which wire is hot when both wires from the ceiling box are black be very careful here i am assuming this is an older house because in newer wiring jobs there would be a white black and green or bare wire if it is old wiring then the insulation could be brittle from age and crack or peel off and come into contact with the box or directly with you and be a shock hazard or short out and be a fire hazard if you don't have a volt meter then you could pickup a non contact voltage detector at the hardware or building supply store and use it instead you would need to make sure the wires aren't connected to the light fixture or at least that the light bulb was removed and that the wires are spread apart from each other then switch on the wall switch and hold the non contact voltage detector near each wire and the one that is hot should cause the detector to light up or beep you can use a volt meter to measure if there is voltage on one wire or the other however you will need to have a grounded wire or grounded ceiling box in order to do that if there is a wall switch for the light then it will need to be turned on when you are ready to check for voltage you need to either take out the light bulb or disconnect the wires from the light fixture then set the volt meter to measure ac voltage and touch one lead to the bare wire and the other lead to the grounded wire or box the meter will show you if there is any voltage there in the us you should be measuring about volts ac if there is voltage on both wires then you have a problem with the wiring like maybe a short somewhere that needs to be fixed if this is an old house then you might not have a ground wire or grounded box in which case the volt meter will only tell you if you have voltage across the two wires but not which one is the hot wire in this case you can either run a wire to a grounded metal item like a metal water pipe to use for the ground wire in the previous measurement method  Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Incandescent light bulb Transformer Circuit design Electrical wiring Overhead lines Thermostat Oscilloscope High-voltage hazards Volt Fluorescent lamp Lighting Residual-current device Spark plug Welding Ground and neutral Vacuum tube Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Transistor Fire fighting Ground (electricity) RS-232 X10 (industry standard) Lineman (occupation) Light-emitting diode Thermal power station Potentiometer George Westinghouse Ultraviolet Solar power Stage lighting Digital circuit Electrical wiring (UK) Earthing system Spark gap Split phase Gas metal arc welding Electricity meter Naval mine Circuit breaker Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Fuse (electrical) Tesla coil Three-phase electric power Electrophysiology Third rail Voltmeter Antenna (radio) BS 1363 Electrical resistance Rail terminology Lightning Universal Serial Bus High-voltage direct current Electricity Bicycle lighting Distribution board Electric motor Central processing unit Action potential Mercury-vapor lamp Lightning rod CMOS Ceramics Phantom power Alternating current Glossary of firefighting equipment X-ray Electric power transmission Solar cell Street light Transmitter Loudspeaker Current (electricity) Analog-to-digital converter Impedance matching Windows XP Wind power Linear particle accelerator Fusor Decibel Overhead powerline Conductor (material) Fan (implement)

do most homes have some amount of settlement my home is years i have seen tiny verticle cracks we dwell on a living planet yes most houses settle after construction and they continue to rise and fall with the expansion of the ground they are built on depending on soil types differing soil clay rock mixtures and of course the amount of moisture water they contain if you experience a drought dry then the soil clay shrinks causing the buildings foundations to sink with the ground if you have heavy rain then the soil clay swells and the building rises also when and if you have uneven moisture in the location of the buildings foundations then rise and fall are uneven and great stress is placed on the foundations which sometimes crack and subsiquently cause disturbance in the structure cracks are the stress signs of this occurrance nearly always this is the result of uneven moisture in the sub soil some ways of limitting this are not to have garden beds at or near the perimeter of the building near the foundation as watering these can cause uneven soil moisture not to let damaged gutters downpipes persist get them repaired asap do not grow large rooted trees adjacent to buildings the root system can cause major foundation faults drainage and water pipes if leaking are also bad news what a great number of buildings lack is a correctly formed and constructed drainage system that is ground water drainage this is a major consideration in construction and it is quite often overlooked especially by owner builders hope this is useful later jim contract builder for years  Seismic retrofit Desert Drainage Soil Erosion Wood Basement Foundation (architecture) Houseplant Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Desertification Zuiderzee Works Natural disaster Carnivorous plant Deforestation Dam The Fens Gypsy moth Equine conformation Portland cement Straw-bale construction Disaster Bonsai Weathering Midlothian, Virginia Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Construction Pachypodium habitats Welding Glacier Erie Canal Vegetation Tire Fast bowling Rain Caliche Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Vertisol Civil engineering Global warming and agriculture Geography of China Pachypodium Old growth forest Electrical wiring Autonomous building Sorghum Urinary incontinence Great Lakes Glossary of firefighting terms Air-raid shelter Soil salination Physiological plant disorders Road Geography of Russia Home repair Rail tracks 2005 Maharashtra floods Masonry Garden Strawberry A151 road 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Yosemite National Park Geography of Africa Shipwreck Prosopis cineraria Water Amazon River Great Mosque of Djenn__ Disc brake Tofu Western United States Geography of Brazil Ecohydrology Aluminium Climate of the United Kingdom Thunderstorm Pile Architecture of the California missions Geography of India Aquifer Corrosion Death Valley National Park Geology of the Moon Eutrophication Hydroponics Root Lake Sulfur Moss Chaco Culture National Historical Park Flood

electric motor smokes won't spin i am trying to fix the electric motor on a paper shredder i have all the pieces and when the motor is together it seems to turn fine but when i plug it in it smokes from the end with the brushes you can hear the click of the juice hitting it when you plug it in but then a few seconds later the thin smoke starts the brushes seem to be in pretty good shape but there's no spring behind them so it could be that they aren't making contact it seems like they should have springs to push them but instead it looks like the tension of he wire that pushes them toward the middle shouldn't they have springs of some sort if the brushes are supposed to touch the inside metal ring commutator and don't would that cause the smoke somehow everything else on this thing seems to be in good shape thanks springs would be nice it isn't likely someone tried a repair and missed both all the springs the smoke has to be from the coil shorting out it is overheating because all the current isn't passing to the correct parts usually one is toast when ti gets hot enough to smoke  Electric motor Spark plug Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Theory of conduct Seismometer Enigma machine Drag racing Welding Transformer Bong Guitar Thermal power station Wire Earring Electrical generator Overhead lines Soldering Fan (implement) Poker jargon Tire Carburetor Solar power Residual-current device Spacecraft propulsion Pottery Equine conformation Airsoft Reading spark plugs for racing Commutator (electric) Incandescent light bulb Ignition system BS 1363 Switch Gas metal arc welding Mouse (computing) Hiberno-English Fire fighting RuneScape quests Snooker Brushless DC electric motor Textile manufacturing Shell (projectile) Social rule Circuit design Alternating current Milton H.

does anyone know how to fix condensation from aluminum window frames we live in central texas during the wintertime we have a lot of condensation forming on the metal frames the house is relatively new and we would prefer not to have to replace our windows just for this reason we have thought about using dehumidifiers but the house is already too dry for us in the winter does anyone know how to fix this problem we would appreciate any help you can give on this one the condensation comes from the differing temps on each side of the glass or aluminium all metals will do this try leaving the curtains open so the warmer air inside evaporates the moisture leave the curtains open to allow air to circulate around the window put a fan in front of the window to evaporate the moisture can you put up a verandah or something to act a a heat trap this should raise the temp on the outside of the window  Air conditioning Solar power Dehumidifier Fog Thermal power station Window Aluminium HVAC Precipitation (meteorology) Relative humidity Basement Water vapor Vacuum tube Casting Chinook wind Microphone Explosive material Temperature Phase (matter) Humidity Instant coffee Cookware and bakeware Thunderstorm Sento Rain Dairy Ocean thermal energy conversion Motorcycle Carbon dioxide Autonomous building Ammonia Brewery Desert Evaporation Fire extinguisher Car body style Water Bong Welding Apollo Command/Service Module Mercury (element) Phase change heat pump El Ni__o Thermoregulation Adiabatic lapse rate Coffee Heat exchanger Insulation Steam engine Nitrogen Ice Swamp cooler Corrosion Mattress Climate of the United Kingdom M16 (rifle) Smoke-screen Hydrogen Global climate model Diseases of the honeybee Glass Plastic Comet Polyethylene terephthalate Origin of life Cloud Micro-encapsulation Titanium Watercooling Bicycle brake systems Desiccation Circuit design Humidifier Ventilation Dodge Neon Carburetor Perfume Magnesium Oscilloscope Temperature inversion Fire fighting Cannabis cultivation The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Sulfur Inflation Bicycle frame Atmospheric circulation Houseplant Soil pH Geography of Chile Bose-Einstein condensate Cumulonimbus cloud Solar cell Lithium aluminium hydride Sugar beet Fossil fuel power plant Geology of the Moon Haloalkane

how can i make my roof into a deck we have a single family house with a walk out flat roof there's actually a sliding glass door it has no railing the roof is currently tar covered with some kind of silver patches i'm getting it ready to sell and we're considering changing it into a deck someone suggested i just paint the roof white and attach a white wrought iron railing is this a good idea or is there a better way to do this without spending a lot of money i would recommend having a fiber glass deck installed a professional would have to be hired and proper permits attained a fiberglass deck would be the best solution and provide the best protection of future leaks railing systems can easily be installed over these types of decks if you want something less expensive i would just say put down an ice shield base over the existing roof and then lay a wood deck system over it eventually water problems will develop and the deck will have to be removed for the repair i would hate to recommend this if the house is being sold and a problem is being left for someone else to deal with  Roof Seismic retrofit Deck (ship) Mattress Poker jargon Asbestos Naval mine Bay Area Rapid Transit Plastic Skateboard Drill bit Glossary of climbing terms Windows XP Casting Rail terminology Boat building Home repair Elevator Autorack Radio controlled airplane Solar power Wayne Corporation Skateboarding trick Dinghy Jute Welding Nuclear power Door Porsche 993 Tarot Light-frame construction Glossary of nautical terms Yu-Gi-Oh!

central a c condensation question is there such thing as too much condensation for the a c unit the condensate drain from the unit in the basement started leaking and i have been collecting the condensate in a bucket i feel like there is too much i get like gallons or more a day this seems alot to me i wonder if this is a sign of a problem with the unit i thought the evaporation of the condensation across the coil was what created the cooling and worry if the condensation is an issue i live in nj and it has been humid but we always seen to get alot of condensation any suggestions pour some bleach into the condensate drain in the evaporator it will clear and clean out the line the cooling is done by the evaporation of the refrigerant inside of the evaporator when the refrigerant changes states from a liquid to a gas it absorbs heat the compressor pressurizes the gas and it is returned to a liquid state in the condenser where it dissipates the heat it has absorbed basic temperature and pressure correlations i m not sure if many of the people answering your question know the basics of the refrigeration system  Phase change heat pump Gas absorption refrigerator Refrigerator Brewery Ocean thermal energy conversion Heat exchanger Thermal power station Water vapor Evaporation Phase (matter) Gas compressor Humidity Distillation HVAC Phase transition Relative humidity Superconductivity Fossil fuel power plant Solar power Carbon dioxide Swamp cooler Fog Refrigeration Ammonia Hyperthermia Apollo 13 Dairy Vacuum Heat Evaporative cooling Fire fighting Helium Basement Ice Thermostat Bong Explosive material Carburetor Haloalkane Pebble bed reactor Stirling engine Refrigerant Natural gas Fermionic condensate Fire extinguisher Sun Water (molecule) Casting Nitrogen Origin of life Hydrogen economy Hydrogen Town gas Condensed matter physics Coffee Water Motor oil Xenon Dehumidifier Vacuum tube STS-87 Alcohol fuel Big Bang Furnace Space shuttle main engine Turbocharger Weather lore Hydropower Hydrogen peroxide Geothermal exchange heat pump Thunderstorm Glass Rankine cycle Ozone depletion Neon Bose-Einstein condensate Boiling point Lake Mercury arc valve Fractional distillation Milk Spark plug Liquified petroleum gas Heinkel He 100 Dry cleaning Gas turbine Mercury (element) Climate of the United Kingdom Houseplant Greenhouse effect Turbojet Internal combustion engine Renewable energy

how to remove stubborn screw in heater element on electric water heater i've tried removing it with the usually screwdriver socket combo using a screwdriver on both sides like a t handle and it still wont budge i went through this a few months ago and actually broke the end of the element trying to get it off with a plumbers wrench that also had the t handle lol i ended up having to order a new element from sears online and when it arrived a few days later i was surprised to see on a list of recommended parts a tool made for removing the element i would suggest that you try your local plumbing supply for the right tool and you should probably spray the old element with some penetrating oil i am sure you have drained the water heater already if you are trying to remove the element  Screw Wrench BS 1363 Socket Thermal power station Screwdriver Domestic water system Drill bit Home repair Autonomous building Glossary of firefighting equipment Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Knife Drill Tap wrench Motor oil Genericized trademark Fountain Samovar Soldering Refrigerator Thermostat Siphon 1973 oil crisis D-subminiature Drill bit shank Vacuum tube Seismic retrofit Toilet paper Apollo 13 Dialysis Fuse (electrical) Basement Casting Fire fighting Water heater Tool Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Planet of the Daleks Anchor Dundas Square Floyd Rose Sonic screwdriver Pliers Dishwasher Woodworking Manicure Marine aquarium Diesel engine Water supply Furnace Solar power Metalworking HVAC M16 (rifle) Fossil fuel power plant Fan (implement) Tamper resistance Aquarium Burma Campaign Iron Bolted joint Washing machine Fire extinguisher Plumbing fixture Smoke-screen Dollar store Transistor Sulfuric acid Radiator Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Oscilloscope Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans National Electrical Code (US) Sears Holdings Corporation Fire hydrant Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Python programming language Windows XP USS Wichita (CA-45) Injection moulding Just In Time Chevrolet Corvair Swiss Army knife Torque wrench Hard water Pinball Vise (tool) Town gas Cruising (maritime) Ammunition Tunisia Campaign Bathroom Mosquito Carbon dioxide Hydrochloric acid Stage lighting Electricity meter Glossary of firefighting terms

recently had repair to new cabinet vendor is saying it will darken over several weeks to match original shade moved into new home one cabinet needed minor repair vendor took cabinet to his shop sanded and stained however repair area is noticeably lighter than all other adjacent cabinets vendor said it is cherry wood real and stained hazlenut color the color will darken to match other cabinets within a couple of weeks from lighting in the house it seems like i'm getting a fish story can anyone tell me the real skinny thanks cherry does darken over time particularly if exposed to sunlight some flourescent lights will do this also as to how much it will darken well we can't really say if it will be enough without being there to look at it however your vendor can always take it back and darken it some more by applying a slightly darker color to the topcoat without having to sand it all back to bare wood just a little light scuffing to get the new topcoat to adhere would be all that's necessary my recommendation would be to get it in writing that if the color does not conform to the rest of the cabinets within days that the vendor will rework it you didnt mention it but realistically they should have taken a door or drawer face that did not need repair to use as a reference matching existing colors is a challenge at times and a good reference sample is priceless good luck  Black Arcade cabinet Knife Sunlight Color theory Melanin Eye color Coffee Human skin color Ultraviolet Computer animation Wood Campfire Nintendo Entertainment System Microscopy Wood carving Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Bluebeard's Castle Atari 8-bit family Lunar eclipse Extraterrestrial skies Bulk vending Shroud of Turin Radio controlled airplane Color blindness Physical attractiveness Drawing Kigo Magical objects in Harry Potter NTSC Volleyball Babe Ruth Oscilloscope Shade Wing Commander (computer game) Equine conformation Seismic retrofit Staining (biology) Final Fantasy (video game) Four color theorem Dog Chess terminology Pump It Up Prime Minister of Canada Kitchen USS Sand Lance (SS-381) The Tomb of the Cybermen Autogyro St Albans Cathedral Psoriasis Prime Minister of the United Kingdom X Window System Shetland Sheepdog Tooth bleaching Agarose gel electrophoresis Houseplant Sun Stained glass Professional wrestling slang Red Christmas tree USS Seadragon (SS-194) Glass Albedo Anchor Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Coat (dog) Fischer Random Chess Professional wrestling match types Ammolite Woodworking Primer (paint) Medical prescription Weight training Dragon Booster Heinkel He 100 Japanese tea ceremony CPU cache Marching band Color temperature Electron microscope San Francisco Giants Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Harp OpenGL Scientology beliefs and practices Richard Rahl Color Color vision Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February USS Augusta (CA-31) Biblical archaeology Glasses The Hobbit Spidey Super Stories

has anyone used bath fitters to cover an old tile shower did you feel it was worth the investment i called for an estimate and they stressed i had to be the person home since they want to offer me incentatives this makes me wonder if it is a legitimate service why incentives need to be offered anyone know what these incentives will be i really don't want to deal with a pushy salesperson there are main companies doing this type of remodel luxury bath re bath bath fitter luxury bath is the highest quality by a long shot it also has a product called microban microban is a antimicrobial product that actually kills mold and mildew it also comes with the best warranty www luxurybath com re bath would be my second choice the reason being is they like luxury bath have a one piece dog leg the area on the wall in front off the tub the dog leg goes from the top of the tub rail to the floor the reason i would not recommend bath fitter is because of the dog leg this is the area that is most prone to leaking and they piece it together here as far as other options there is tearing it out and starting over ceramic tile re glazing with tearing it out you will be forced to use a fiberglass tub which is very porous making it very difficult to clean for those that are reading this thinking how nice your fiberglass tub is go in there and rub your fingers over it it may look o k but it will be greasy that s because the porous material is literally sucking the soap scum in fiberglass surrounds are also known for cracking and being spongy when you stand in them ceramic tile is definitely attractive but unfortunately the grout is the weak point after all its sand and sand sucks in the water making it a perfect surface for mold and mildew grout also needs maintenance once a month but before you do the maintenance you need to clean it with a toothbrush re glazing is when they paint the tub this is more of a band aid if your trying to sell the home but don t care how it will look in months to year it also doesn't address the walls or fixtures  Casting Pottery Tile Sento Strap-on dildo Drill bit Violin Plastic Mattress Glass Customs and etiquette of Japan Fiberglass Textile manufacturing Ceramics Seismic retrofit Upholstery Equine conformation Bong Menstrual cup Asbestos Privatization Fecal incontinence Diving Hamster Japanese toilet Roof Cookware and bakeware Masonry Gay bathhouse Dishwasher King Khalid International Airport Soap Dymaxion house Ra (board game) Spark plug Microeconomics Swimming Wallpaper group Combine (Half-Life 2) Social rule Toilet Fuselage Volleyball Bath Loudspeaker Tooth enamel Washroom Solar power Basement Lionel Corporation Boat building Breastfeeding Bathroom Glaze Ford Thunderbird Psoriasis Tank Hydrotherapy Happy Tree Friends Top-bar hive Wood Wind turbine Sales Pebble bed reactor Poker jargon Naruto jutsu Xanadu House Brush Jackass: The Movie Plame affair Carburetor Tooth Glossary of climbing terms Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Tire Have I Got News For You Korean tea ceremony Professional wrestling holds Terminal ballistics Richard Chase Mosaic Donald Trump Radio controlled airplane Manicure Japanese tea ceremony Cast iron Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve St Albans Cathedral Product Lifecycle Management

house a c unit is not cooling properly i'm at my girl friend's loft and one of her a c units is not cooling it keeps running and running but the room is at or above she had service done to it months ago and they supposedly added freon it had been bone dry they said the was probably a leak but did not find it or look for it what are the signs that the freon is out again how does one find a leak one of the insulated copper pipes that run into or out of the unit was frozen block of ice i turned the unit off and in about hrs it has all melted it would cool properly now until it froze again thanks it is low on freon again you can have it gassed up again but i would ask for them to find and fix the leak depending on where the leak is this could be a costly undertaking once they find the leak you still have to remove what freon is still in the unit to a holding tank pressurize the system with nitrogen fix the leak repressurize with nitrogen to make sure it doesnt leak anymore pull a vacumun on the system to hergs minumun if it will not do this you still have a leak then recharge the system with freon to do a job like this without replacing either the a coil or condensing unit will still cost dollars and up depending on where you live plus parts and extra freon to the make up the difference between what they saved from your system and what it needs to operate properly to repair a leak with out replacing anything i charge dollars plus parts nitrogen freon silver solder and liquid line filter dryer it is legal to just put more freon in the unit as long as it does not have to have more than percent of the total charge installed yearly by one service man in other words one service man can only recharge it once a year legally without fixing the leak  Air conditioning Soldering Refrigerator Carbon dioxide Ammonia Water (molecule) Solar power Cray-1 Thermal power station Carburetor Brewery Printed circuit board Casting Nuclear power Space Shuttle external tank Nitrogen Ice cream Hydrogen economy Water purification Spark plug Fossil fuel power plant Internal combustion engine Sewage treatment Irrigation Autonomous building Dairy Town gas Fuel cell Solder Fire extinguisher Gas metal arc welding Explosive material Apollo 13 Thermostat Cryogenics Rocket fuel Superconductivity Glass Phase (matter) Air pollution Phase change heat pump Heat Cryonics Toyota Prius Helium Electrical wiring Ice Pebble bed reactor Bong Diving suit Mattress Overclocking Plastic Pound sterling Gasoline Euro Water vapor Brazing Battery (electricity) Vacuum Relay Tire Alcohol fuel Ceramics Solar cell Liquefied natural gas Hydrogen Oxy-fuel welding and cutting High-voltage direct current Motor oil Capacitor Plame affair Breathing gas Inflation Natural gas Nickel-cadmium battery Hybrid vehicle Hydraulic machinery Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Fluorescent lamp Hydrogen peroxide Liquid nitrogen economy Space disaster Menstrual cup United States dollar Seismic retrofit Energy development Engine cooling Items in the Metroid series

how much does it cost to switch from fuses to circuit breakers i'm assuming the actual supplies wouldn't be too expensive but the labor would be the killer you are correct a amp homeline breaker panel with a few breakers will cost you about if the electrician is able to just pull out the old fuse box and swing the wires into the new breaker panel you would have about hours labor more or less if he has to add a junction box and extend wires to reach the breaker panel you will have to add more time your bill will depend on the electrician's rate per hour and if he charges a service call give a few electricians a call in your area and take bids let them know you are contacting other electricians and you will get the best bang for your buck make sure they are licensed  BS 1363 Fuse (electrical) Circuit breaker Residual-current device Electrician Distribution board Solar cell Electrical wiring (UK) Relay Three-phase electric power Circuit design Oscilloscope Ring circuit National Electrical Code (US) Gas metal arc welding Switch Vacuum tube Apollo Command/Service Module Incandescent light bulb Transformer Professional wrestling throws Digital circuit Solar power Loudspeaker Armored Core Electrical wiring Dimmer Transistor Capacitor Operational amplifier Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Electric motor Power strip Ground and neutral Ampere Contact breaker Oplan Bojinka Voice over IP Baseball Telephone numbering plan Welding Telephone exchange Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Cable television Electrical breakdown Perl Labor theory of value Alternating current High-voltage direct current Diode Earthing system Apollo Guidance Computer Solar power satellite Inflation Electricity meter Electrophysiology Telegraphy Florida East Coast Railway Ground (electricity) Gliding Killian documents Labour economics Solar panel Cray-1 Apollo 13 Naval mine Hall effect Ignition system Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Construction Home Box Office Programmable logic controller Lineman (occupation) Microeconomics Arcade cabinet CMOS Split phase Battery (electricity) Liquid crystal display Action potential Nuclear fusion North American Numbering Plan Elevator Tesla coil Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Europlug Altair 8800 Poker jargon Battery electric vehicle Submarine communications cable Citizens' band radio Voltage drop Nuclear power Pyramid (game show) Overhead lines Switched-mode power supply Wire wrap Rebreather Supply and demand

clothes dryer runs but no heat everyone keeps telling me that a fuse may be blown in my dryer which is why it doesn't heat up the only fuse i'm aware of in a clothes dryer is a thermal fuse but people say to check the fuse panel and or circuit breaker i believe they're talking about the circuit breaker in my home but the power to the dryer is obviously fine a single outlet it's only the heating element that will not work i guess i'm asking if there are other fuses or if there's an internal circuit breaker inside a clothes dryer that i'm not seeing when i pull off the back panel the dryer is a whirlpool washer dryer combo lte d you have to first check the power getting or not getting to the dryer its uses two legs of v but they are out of phase with one another if one is not getting power to the dryer it will still run on the other leg but no heat the thermofuse is located on the heater element housing but may not be the problem dont guess just go to http appliancequickfix com and it will tell you how to check where the problem lies  Fuse (electrical) Circuit breaker Residual-current device Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Vacuum tube BS 1363 Three-phase electric power Transformer Ring circuit Thermal power station Solar power Spark plug Electrical wiring Washing machine Apollo Command/Service Module Heat Glossary of firefighting equipment Circuit design Nuclear weapon design Oplan Bojinka Fan (implement) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Armored Core Upholstery Carburetor Apollo 13 Oscilloscope Diode Power strip Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets National Electrical Code (US) Cruising (maritime) Nuclear fusion Relay Ford Ranger EV Glass Inertial confinement fusion Short circuit Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Escape from New York Nuclear fission Little Britain Electrophysiology Sun Stirling engine Brewery Discovery One Japanese toilet Dishwasher Seismic retrofit Fire alarm control panel Fecal incontinence Basement Items in the Metroid series Loudspeaker Insulation Figure skating Diving suit Electrical wiring (UK) Solar collector Transistor Fire extinguisher Solar panel Electrical breakdown Autonomous building Ground and neutral The Isley Brothers Gliding Central processing unit Thermodynamic equilibrium Quantum computer Alternating current Earthing system Fossil fuel power plant Stellar evolution Ground (electricity) Hydraulic machinery Cold fusion Capacitor Space Shuttle external tank Professional wrestling throws Electric motor Carbon dioxide Late Night with Conan O'Brien Mars Exploration Rover Ceramics Tank Ohm's law Pottery Manhattan Project Vegeta Furnace Renewable energy Steam engine Hot air balloon Conductor (material) Paragliding Hemp

why do electric currents and sockets get hot a nicer answer when electricity passes through anything there is a certain amount of resistance the force that it takes to make the current run through this resistance is the voltage if there is higher resistance you need a higher voltage water is a good conductor meaning that there is less resistance and is better than air a human body is also a good conductor because of the water in us a copper wire is very good and gold is even better but there is still a level of resistance when anything in the world encounters resistance the force behind it creates heat as that object is forced through you can feel the heat on your hands when you rub them on your pants same thing that is why copper becomes hot and people receive burns when electrocuted make sense oh and when the news says that someone got zapped with say volts you need to know the amount of current or amps to really know what that means current is what kills you that is what stops your heart the voltage is just the punch behind it it hurts but without the current you should live through it it only takes a tiny tiny bit of current to kill you but you can live through a heck of a lot of voltage  Volt Circuit design Capacitor Electrical resistance Electric shock Transformer Incandescent light bulb High-voltage hazards Electricity Current (electricity) Fuse (electrical) Solar cell Split phase Resistor Electrical wiring Welding Lightning Hall effect Electrical generator Tesla coil Electric motor Decibel Peltier-Seebeck effect Conductor (material) Action potential MOSFET Three-phase electric power Superconductivity Ceramics War of Currents Voltage drop Ampere Ground (electricity) Circuit breaker Diode Alternating current Spacecraft propulsion Vacuum tube Operational amplifier BS 1363 Battery (electricity) Inductor Electric power transmission Printed circuit board Electrical element Impedance matching Third rail Mains electricity Thermostat Thermal power station Wind turbine Ohm's law Residual-current device Fluorescent lamp Water (molecule) Electricity meter Microphone Transistor Electric chair Oxygen sensor Internal ballistics Central processing unit Gas metal arc welding Solar panel Ozone Fossil fuel power plant Lightning rod Electronic amplifier Electrometer Wire Electroshock gun Pok__mon Abilities Corona discharge Titanium George Westinghouse Directed-energy weapon Energy development Copper Theory of conduct Charles Wheatstone Renewable energy Loudspeaker Direct current Lineman (occupation) Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets RS-232 Light switch Piccolo Junior Saga Bicycle lighting CPU design Nonconductor

mold in my town home what should we do my husband and i moved into a town home last sept and got our place inspected by an inspector last july how we discovered this was we had a leak in our kitchen and right above it is the shower so we knew it coming from the show from the bathroom we had a plummer come out to look at the problem and he cut the cieling in the kitchen and their was mold pretty much all over we called our insector and he said to call our home insurance company and he had nothing to do with it the plummer said the home insurance does not cover the mold because it was there before we purchase the town home who should we go after the home inspector the people who sold us the town home any suggestions would help should we get an attorney if so what time of an attorney should we look for i am sorry for your situation the only way to get rid of mold is to have a professional come in a re mediate it it is not something that you can just bleach you may have to gut the source it sounds to me like it was a slow water leak that over time progressed mold grows very quickly and spreads unfortunately homeowners insurance does not cover mold but you need to be clever in how you describe the event to them i would say there is a water leak but the source is unknown at this time water damage is throughout the area and it is imperative to get this taken care of before mold mildew develops i would start a claim for water damage make sure you get the adjuster's name contact information etc and write letter out the wazoo phone calls don't always work but letter via email or fax do it never hurts i wouldnt get an attorney involved until the claim is denied by your insurance company call and write letters and bug the heck out of them  Insurance Plame affair Plame affair timeline Karl Rove Surveillance SCO-Linux controversies Downing Street memo Life insurance Judith Miller (journalist) Pretty Good Privacy Killian documents Wal-Mart Health insurance 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Advance fee fraud Home repair Katelyn Faber Kitchen Mediation David Kelly Mortgage W.

condo a c problem hoa i live in a story condo complex with seperate central a c for each unit there is a leak in the refrigeration line between the indoor and outdoor units that is apparently not in an accessible area of the pipe for detection and i am being told they would need to run a new refrigerant line of course being a condo my ability to tear up inside or outside walls is limited has anyone gone through something like this before am i resonsible for the cost or is the a hoa issue how likely is the hoa to be receptive to running a pipe up the wall outsiderather than tearing up the shingles what is the process can the a c company work directly with the hoa to determine how to correct or do i need to be a middleman in the process anything that an individual owner needs to do that would affect the outside of the structure or common must be approved by the association especially if the association is responsible for structural maintenance they cannot stop you from making repairs they can limit how it is done you are responsible for the cost of all repair work directly related to your unit unless specifically indicated in the association's corporate by laws or covenants and restrictions if the association places restrictions on how the repair can be made and this results in added cost you could make a claim for the difference to be paid by the association which would probably stand up in court i was president of my association for a year our unwritten policy was no harm no foul when it came to such matters in a case like this our board would do something like all the conduit must be painted the same color as the trim within six months but our members would have their answer within hours read your copies of the association documentation you received at closing it is always the start of point luck  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Corporate governance Plame affair Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Public domain Volleyball Corporation Classified information Intellectual property Football (soccer) Insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Trade union Scientology beliefs and practices Cable television Labor theory of value CPU cache Israeli West Bank barrier Autism DNA repair Windows 2000 National Kidney Foundation Singapore Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Cray-1 Life insurance Expert system Wal-Mart Dairy RFID Parliament of the United Kingdom XML Easement Supreme Court of the United States Information Technology Infrastructure Library Civil rights Pirate decryption Smoking ban Pretty Good Privacy Constitution Thermal power station Energy development United States House of Representatives PaX Canadian House of Commons Antenna (radio) Casting Paralegal Separation of church and state Legal research Reliability engineering Extreme Programming Digital rights management Public-key cryptography Trademark Article One of the United States Constitution Economic inequality Surveillance Publicly funded medicine West Side Highway Abortion Perl BNSF Railway United States Postal Service Nuclear magnetic resonance Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Microeconomics Education in the United States Psychology Product Lifecycle Management Originalism Australian constitutional law Baseball Call centre Ultimate (sport) Refrigerator OpenDocument Nintendo Entertainment System Mediation Monetary policy DVD Light-emitting diode American individualist anarchism Air New Zealand Act of Parliament San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Transformation problem Copy protection Cascading Style Sheets Combine (Half-Life 2) Campaign finance reform Vietnam Radar

what boiler would be appropriate for a power shower that kicks out l of hot water a minute i have an old boiler the one you turn on and heats up all the water before you use it the one with a tank i'm looking for an upgrade that doesn't use a tank i'm concerned that it would have to be a good efficint boiler that can work really hard and kick out lots of hot water you don't use a combination boiler with a power shower use a thermostatic mixer valve combi compatible and there are a lot of combi's that will deliver litres plus i use worcester bosch boilers the cdi gives litres per minute if you insist on the power shower you will need a cylinder with the capability to deliver the amount of water you need this should be calculated taking into account the cold water supply from a storage tank this will equalise the pressure between hot and cold water the other thing to remember is that with the new energy efficiency regulations you cannot install a conventional with tanks boiler which exceeds your heat requirements  Thermostat Furnace Steam engine Solar power Fossil fuel power plant Thermal power station Diesel engine Fuel injection Energy development Boiler Stirling engine Explosive material Internal combustion engine Autonomous building HVAC Diving cylinder Carburetor Renewable energy Scuba set Iowa class battleship Heat Gasoline Ocean thermal energy conversion Horsepower Water heater Sewage treatment Central heating Hydrogen economy Fire fighting Novelty (locomotive) Alcohol fuel Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Hydraulic machinery Pebble bed reactor Dishwasher Fuel cell Nuclear power Spacecraft propulsion Incineration Spark plug Turbocharger Glossary of firefighting terms Wind power Tier One Apollo 13 Refrigerator Electrical generator Diode Environmental concerns with electricity generation Fusion power Welding Power station Tap (valve) Newcomen steam engine Hydropower Nuclear reactor Cold fusion Porsche 911 Carbon dioxide Alternative fuel Space shuttle main engine E85 Hard disk T-64 Air conditioning Siphon Torpedo Biodiesel Ironing Temperature Cogeneration Irrigation Toyota Prius Three Mile Island Petroleum Natural gas Hybrid vehicle Steam Tank Two-stroke cycle Steam locomotive nomenclature Energy Portable stove Dairy Rolls-Royce Merlin Jet engine Future energy development Manitoba Hydro Transformer Protoss Rebreather Circuit breaker Convair B-36

water coming out between the wall and floor i have been trying to solve this problem for months initially i thought it was the heater water coming out from the temperature outlet drain after the heater technican checked we found out that the water is actually coming out between the floor and wall i have never experience water coming out from such spot shouldn't the water goes down to my downstair neighbour instead if there is any pipe leaking inside the wall i suspect the water might have come from the shower area floor meaning the water go in through some crack and travel about cm and come out to between the floor wall joint is it possible have anybody experience it before behind where the tub water outlet shower head pipe and water handles penetrate the shower you have your pipes hot cold or drain lines could be the culprit it would be easy enough to verify that the shower head pipe is tight just get a pair of adjustable pliers and a towel keeps the pliers from marring the pipe and give a little twist clockwise if it's tight it's not the problem you might be able to remove the handles from the hot and cold valves and then remove the cover plates to see if there is moisture in this area just use a flashlight or stick a twisted up paper towel inside the gap and see if it comes back wet if this doesn't find the leak you will probably end up tearing into the wall i wouldn't wait too long to find it the damage could be traveling inside the wall to places you haven't found yet good luck to ya  Thermal power station Sento Fecal incontinence Sauna Domestic water system Fire fighting Seismic retrofit Furnace Spark plug Vacuum tube Brewery Menstrual cup Plumbing fixture Japanese toilet Cruising (maritime) Tire Customs and etiquette of Japan HVAC Casting Apollo 13 Glossary of firefighting terms Welding Urinary incontinence Glossary of firefighting equipment Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Poker jargon Diving suit Solar power Soldering Reading spark plugs for racing Dialysis Siphon Thermostat Volleyball Home repair Combine (Half-Life 2) Hyperthermia Upholstery Chevrolet Corvair engine Hydraulic machinery The Inside Drill bit Pliers Fossil fuel power plant Swimming pool Nuclear power E85 Bathroom Carburetor Dodge Neon Towel Equine conformation Rail terminology Chevrolet Corvair Pottery Bong Anal sex Passive solar Fire hydrant Bathing Cannabis cultivation Traumatic brain injury Opportunity rover Climate of the United Kingdom Toilet paper Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Dishwasher Wrench Oxyacetylene Plastic Electrical wiring Glossary of partner dance terms Internal ballistics Autonomous building Massage Sleeve valve Diseases of the honeybee RuneScape quests Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Glacier Hydrogen economy Gay bathhouse Rope Heat Water Happy Tree Friends Escape from New York Hard disk Fan (implement) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Lake District Water heater

do air purifiers make your walls and carpets black i have been told by different people that air purifiers made their walls carpets and window hangings black air purifiers that work by ionizing the air will tend to leave a black residue on surfaces that is the dust that it pulled out of the air the way these purifiers work is that they change the 'charge' on the air dust as it passes thru the machine then those charged ions will be attracted to surfaces with the opposite charge thus the residue on surfaces these particular types of machines wreak havoc with some computers too by the way if you need an air purifier i first recommend starting with your central air filter start off by using a better quality of filter there and change that filter regularly it also helps if you use a vacuum cleaner with a hepa filter to prevent blowing the really fine dust right thru the machine and out into the air again now you're ready to look at air cleaners if you don't mind the residue on the surfaces then you may prefer a machine that ionizes the air they tend to be quiter than a traditional 'filter' type air cleaner i wouldnt put it in the same room as my computer tho personally i prefer filter products all the dirt dust is trapped in the filter right where i want it good luck  Vacuum cleaner Dry cleaning Air purifier Vacuum Water purification Nuclear fallout Drill bit Diode Dairy Vacuum tube Mass spectrometry Electrostatic precipitator Carburetor Carpet Bong Hard disk Welding Basement Corona discharge Ion Air filter Solar power Catalytic converter Glass Sun Particulate Radiation hardening Lighting Liquid crystal display House dust mite Roomba Syphon Filter Mattress Coffee Printed circuit board Laundry detergent Air conditioning Soap E85 Electrophysiology Magnet Helium Cathode ray tube Air pollution Water (molecule) Nuclear weapon design Internal ballistics Casting Sugarcane Polarization Silicon Motor oil Water Tenshinhan Window Textile manufacturing Screw Brazing G-Man (Half-Life) Tattoo Dust Typewriter Nuclear explosion Loudspeaker Spark plug HVAC Radio controlled car Radon Cannabis cultivation Cassini-Huygens Sake Fan (implement) Bulk vending Ice core Contact lens Sulfuric acid Electronic amplifier GunBound Aluminium Leo Frank Knife Ionizing radiation Dialysis Firewall (networking) Filtration Ammonia Kirby Corporation Lionel Corporation Haloalkane Colonization of the Moon Zinc Directed-energy weapon Fusion power Tank Diving suit

should the gang plate screws be hot if not what causes this and what should i do to correct it we are finishing our basement and have a dimmer switch wired to recessed lights the screws that connect the gang plate to the dimmer are hot after only a short time with the power on the dimmer switches have a solid state component that controlls the voltage to the lights to cause dimming it needs a heat sink to stay cool enough usually the front plate of the switch is made of aluminum and serves this purpose it is normal for this aluminum plate to be warm but i've never seen them get alarmingly hot since the plate screws go into this aluminum plate they will get hot if the plate is hot these switches are rated for a certian amount of wattage if you exceed the rating it will overheat and probably fail lights sounds like a lot for one dimmer but it depends on what wattage bulbs are being used i think the average dimmers are good for about watts or so add up the total wattage of all the bulbs and compare it with the switch ratings usually stamped on the switch you might have to use dimmers with lights on each or use lower wattage bulbs  Dimmer Incandescent light bulb Transformer Stage lighting Transistor Lighting Light-emitting diode Gas metal arc welding Oscilloscope Diode Welding Fluorescent lamp Light switch Vacuum tube Thermostat Solar cell Circuit design Screw Brewery Capacitor Carburetor Compact fluorescent lamp Electric motor Electrical wiring Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Battery (electricity) Electronic amplifier Fuse (electrical) Engine cooling Electrical element X10 (industry standard) High-voltage direct current Series and parallel circuits Tesla coil Pulse-width modulation Tire Oceanic trench Fire Central processing unit Drill bit Mercury Atlas 6 Circuit breaker Seismic retrofit Thermal power station Potentiometer Jet engine Armored Core Relay Gas tungsten arc welding Renewable energy Propeller Casting Wind turbine M16 (rifle) Heat Loudspeaker Sun Fan (implement) CPU design Temperature Solar variation Spark plug Three-phase electric power Disc brake Motor oil Residual-current device Hydraulic machinery Solar power Glass Resistor Steel Switched-mode power supply Alcohol fuel Spacecraft propulsion Liquid crystal display Heat sink MOSFET Carbon dioxide Wire George Westinghouse Thyristor Hydrogen economy Red Hot Chili Peppers Sewage treatment Spark gap Ocean thermal energy conversion Lightning E85 Fender Telecaster Air conditioning Inflation

just bought a yr old house looks like its settling hi my mom just bought a house that is yrs old when we looked at the house before we put an offer on it we didn't see any problems but when we moved in yesterday we saw some cracks in the basement and the doors wouldn't close properly the painter explained that the house has settled a bit on one side and thats what caused the cracks and the door problems should i be worried about this some people have said that in this city winnipeg canada the soil is rich in something and that settling of houses are very common is there a way to fix the cracks also i believe there's foundation warranty left on the house can i use the warranty to fix this is this going to be a problem when selling the house all construction settles to a point there are a lot of reasons for it you need to get someone to decide why its settling if its foundation use your warrantee you will probably have to go to court to enforce it getting developement companies to do something years later can be a chore the foundation itself might be settling in places or the earth below the foundation may be having issues houses that have been built near here on old dairyland are having issues with uric acid from cow urine actually eating the lime in the cement foundation an inspection prior to escrow should have been performed and would probably have caught the problems  Poker jargon Knots Landing Illegal drug trade Dairy De Lorean DMC-12 Seismic retrofit Copyleft Ashton-Tate Penske Racing Equine conformation Software engineering Air-raid shelter Make money fast Vitamin C Hemp Ben Johnson (athlete) Trademark Dam Temasek Holdings Stanley Cup Plame affair Drug test Gout Characters in the Smurfs Insulin Steam (content delivery) Shaggy dog story 2005 trial of Michael Jackson De Lorean Motor Company Wyatt Earp Mattress Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Straw-bale construction Software license Oakland Athletics Garfield AMD Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Nuclear power Warez DVD Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Grey market Downing Street memo Theory of conduct Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Dodge Charger Piccolo Junior Saga Dodge Neon Electronic Frontier Foundation Mortgage Prostitution Mozilla Firefox British Free Corps Public domain The Basement Tapes Concrete Abbey Gerrymandering STS-61 Heinkel He 100 Philosophical skepticism Green Revolution Uric acid E85 Pretty Good Privacy IBook Year 2000 problem World Trade Center Breastfeeding New Coke Land Rover Fast bowling Prostate cancer Bond Livestock Natural Selection (computer game) Ultima Online Trapping Laserdisc Grandview, U.S.A.

new house help with alarm system i moved into a house that has an alarm system however the panels have no model number of any kind for me to look up online how to use the system in particular i need to change the alarm code i know i can just call an alarm company but i'd like to do this myself if possible any advise karen do not give the above poster any information please contact me via email and i will explain why using the email through yahoo does not reveal your email and i don't want any further information from you i will just expand on why i am saying this i can't email you first because of your settings but do not try to get help from that person it is likely a criminal do not give him any information at all he might be giving out credible business information yet he is telling you not to contact the number for that business you don't know if he is even connected to that business and he is covering his tracks by doing it anonymously on yahoo all under the guise of being busy takes much more time to figure this stuff out via email than one direct phone call and for a busy guy he appears to spend an awful lot of time on here answering such questions and doing the same on other sites as well according to his profile but that isn't the only cause for concern in short your personal safety and property might be at risk if you give him any information he is seeking information from you in a very sneaky way and it might very well be a scam if you have already given him information please contact the alarm company immediately and review the events with them so that they can advise you and protect your home and your safety sorry this is not well organized but wanted to get this posted asap be careful i have also reported this to yahoo and his post will hopefully be erased soon edit if the above poster was being honest with us he would not say that karen shouldn't call him because he pays for it first of all if you look at the website it offers a toll free and a regular phone number which appears would not cost him anything second he said she could call if she was within his service area third if she is not in his service area she cannot call call won't go through if he was paying for the toll free line he would know that  Plame affair Advance fee fraud Surveillance Internet fraud Something Awful Gmail Karl Rove E-mail spam Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Phishing Voice over IP UK telephone numbering plan RuneScape cheats Stopping e-mail abuse Anonymity Plame affair timeline Password Spam (electronic) John Lott Data retention Blog Ocean's Twelve Telephone numbering plan The Standard Theory of conduct Burglar alarm Advertising Extreme Programming Fark.com Call centre Internet privacy Neopets E-mail 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Katelyn Faber Pretty Good Privacy Webmail GSM services Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Telephone tapping National Kidney Foundation Singapore Journalism ethics and standards Abramoff-Reed Indian Gambling Scandal Independent Media Center Credit card Yahoo!

unclogging a toliet that has candlewax in it after my wifes friend stay here she dumped a pot of candlewax in the toliet how can i unclog it candle wax never had that before many other things but not candle wax i have had to unclog many toilets that would flush barely because of obstruction one thing in your favor is that you are dealing with a smooth porcelain finish so this is what i would do first turn off the water supply and flush to remove as much water as possible and disconnect the supply line remove bolts from the bottom of the stool and remove stool if you tip the stool back you will release the water in the trap of the stool at this point the stool should be free of all water clean the bottom of the stool around the drain and remove all of the wax from the stool and from the floor heres where the fun begins get some of those cheap plastic knives the kind like you use for picnics begin scraping away all wax the bond of the wax should be minimal due to the smoothness of the porcelain this will take some time clean as much as you can from the bowl and from the bottom of the stool by the drain once you have all the visible wax removed then you will want to put vasoline on your hands and begin scraping into the trap from both ends you will then have the inner most part of the trap to deal with take a plastic coated coat hanger and begin using it as an auger this method won't be as effective as scraping with the plastic knives but will clear the opening in the trap to allow for free flow of the trap time and waste will remove remaining wax once you have done this you will need a new wax seal to set on the bottom of the stool set stool and fasten in place tighten nuts hand tight and tighten with wrench alternating from one to the other with equal pressure be careful not to over tighten and crack stool reconnect supply line and turn on water supply otherwise buy a new stool and charge your wife's friend for replacement  Poker jargon Toilet Dairy Casting Plumbing fixture Flush toilet Motor oil Dialysis Naval mine Textile manufacturing Top-bar hive Toilet paper Toilet humour Seismic retrofit Domestic water system Thermal power station Siphon Brewery Glass Diseases of the honeybee Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Knife Fecal incontinence Urinal Manicure Wrench Woodworking Lock picking Sewage treatment Transformer Hamster Professional wrestling holds Urinary incontinence Soldering Japanese tea ceremony Clinker (boat building) Cross-country skiing Carburetor Spark plug Printed circuit board Pottery Betting (poker) Irrigation Cheating in poker Internal ballistics Space shuttle main engine Drainage Canoe Draw poker Mattress Japanese toilet Glacier Menstrual cup Dietary fiber Fire fighting Upholstery Double bass Rebreather Shaggy dog story Basement Customs and etiquette of Japan Christmas tree Gilding Bassoon Thermostat Timpani Sewer Circuit design Dry cleaning Diving regulator Anchor Texas hold 'em Fancy rat Skateboarding trick Spanking Environmental concerns with electricity generation Water Water (molecule) Coffee Wood carving Sento Sailing Phonograph cylinder Sea ice Autonomous building Vacuum tube Die (manufacturing) Deforestation

how to replace the drain valve on a water heater we need to get the drain valve out of our water heater it is the orginal drain valve but has corroded it has some kind of cement holding it in place and we can't move it at all with a wrench it is very brittle and will break if any pressure is put on it how can we get it out without destroying the threads on the tank is there a way to do this yourself sorry it's not corroded it's just cemented shut the cement is old and brittle and any pressure we put on it could easily snap the whole thing apart is there a way to get the cement out of there before putting more pressure on it best advice is to leave it alone if the tank is over yrs old the corrosion is on the inside as well this is not unusual especially if there are lots of minerals in your water if you break that valve off odds are you'll end up buying a new tank  Corrosion Seismic retrofit Glossary of firefighting equipment Fire hydrant Thermal power station Apollo 13 Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Motor oil Siphon Flush toilet Spark plug Snorkel Furnace Professional wrestling holds Tire Heart valve Cruising (maritime) Oxyacetylene Half-Life 2 Rail terminology Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Diesel engine Domestic water system Hydraulic machinery Pump Water heater Home repair Newcomen steam engine Screw Samovar Soldering Aortic valve Fossil fuel power plant Tap wrench Shipwreck Reinforced concrete Marine aquarium Brewery Glossary of American football Autonomous building Dialysis Diving regulator Carburetor Plumbing fixture Chevrolet Corvair engine Wave power Containment building Space shuttle main engine Drill bit Three Mile Island Fuel pump Wrench Hard water Vacuum tube Panama Canal Locks Tooth enamel Stucco Terran (StarCraft) Apollo Command/Service Module Irrigation Water hammer Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Basement Transistor Mitral stenosis Novelty (locomotive) Glossary of firefighting terms Rebreather Canal lock Steam engine Liquid breathing Armored Core St Albans Cathedral Timeline of steam power E85 Knife Textile manufacturing Chevrolet Corvair Nuclear power Fire extinguisher Circuit breaker Geyser Scuba set Team Fortress Classic Light switch Diving Dam Gnome et Rh__ne 1973 oil crisis Heart Aortic valve stenosis Concrete Cathodic protection Dishwasher Ceramics Space Shuttle external tank Pebble bed reactor Steel

just bought a pool and just can't seem to get the alkalinity down i lower the ph every day it's not helping bring down the allkalinity though what else can i do normally the total alkalinity would have to be extremely high for ph lowering chemicals not to have much effect on the ph usually ppm or higher how high is yours and what type of pool do you have total alk ranges vary if it's really bad there are two ways of lowering it pouring a high concentration of the acid solution in one area of the pool will destroy more of the total alkalinity in that area a process referred to as slug feeding if i remember correctly pouring it evenly around the pool will take longer to show results on the total alk but it is the way you'd want to do it to lower ph as one of the other answers touched on this can take a long time although i would probably recommend trying it daily and do it away from skimmers and returns if you have an inground you can probably do it in the deep end with the pump off for a little while don't think i'd recommend that in an above ground pool because of the acid sinking and damaging the liner before its gets diluted the other way is to drain and partially refill provided your fill water is not too high in total alkalinity also in most area rain will eventually bring the total alkalinity on its own unless you're also having a problem with a consistently high ph which it sounds like you may you might just let it come down on its own if it's not creating other problems cloudy water etc if it's not outrageously high any idea how it got so high usually it's either from the fill water or using baking soda sodium bicarbonate to raise ph  Soil pH Hydrochloric acid Water purification Ammonia Fire extinguisher Hydrogen peroxide Base (chemistry) Water (molecule) Alkali Motor oil Sulfuric acid Solar power Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina PH Marine aquarium Sodium carbonate Internal ballistics Hydrogen sulfide Tooth enamel Flue gas desulfurization Hard water Tooth Cocaine Battery (electricity) Hydrogen chloride Bread Swimming pool Rebreather Dishwasher Sodium hypochlorite Carburetor Brewery Siphon Nickel-cadmium battery Concentration Action potential Electrolyte Vinegar Aspartame Naval mine Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Sodium hydroxide Gas metal arc welding Chlorine Diving Cyanide Carnivorous plant Hydrogen economy Climate of the United Kingdom E85 Vitamin C Illegal drug trade Drowning Houseplant Fluoride therapy Renewable energy Hypoglycemia Fluoride Sewage treatment Prostate cancer Welding Nutrition Mount Pinatubo Vacuum Corrosion Helium Potassium hydroxide Nitroglycerin Decompression sickness Smoke-screen Breastfeeding Cookware and bakeware Sugar beet Water Fire fighting Airbag Soap Gastric acid Fertility awareness Chocolate Customs and etiquette of Japan Renal physiology Transformer Portland cement Drill bit Enzyme Concrete Acid mine drainage Mattress Ultramarine Tofu Solar cell Solvay process E number

there's thick frost in my freezer around ice maker wall fridge is not cool enough it's a yr old kenmore model top area in refrigerator is not as cool as the bottom shelf temperature is set according to factory recommendation the usual culprits for frost build up at that location are a leak in the water inlet line for the ice maker or a bad seal on the freezer door when i say bad seal you have to check the condition of the seal check to see if anything inside the freezer keeps the door from closing freely and completely and check to see that the door closes on it's own by turning the front two levelers up a bit will help the door swing closed with minimal help deice the freezer i put all of my food into ice chests when having to do this kind of repair dry out the interior and carefully watch for a leak if you suspect a leak you can shut off the water supply to the ice maker and watch for further ice formation if you don't get ice build up turn the water back on and observe again if you get ice build up then you have a leak in the supply system or the ice maker it's self replace as necessary if you shut the water supple off and still get build up a leaking door seal is usally the problem now if the door seal is not at fault then it's time to look at the refrigerant tank and lines icing can be the result of a low coolant level most modern systems don't leak after a few years i have two fridges and two deep freezers all more than years old and working without problems check to see your model has a split cooling system for top and bottom probably not but it's ok to find out if the coolant is low then have a professional leak test the system repair and refill the coolant this however is the least likely unless your fridge gets moved or has been moved since installation if you have moved homes recently it may have been damaged in transit which means it's time for a repairman i hope this helps  Tire Thermal power station Ice Carburetor Nuclear power Ice cream Black Mesa Research Facility Air conditioning Dairy Three Mile Island Solar power Equine conformation Pebble bed reactor Carbon dioxide Basement Home repair Space shuttle main engine Seismic retrofit Water (molecule) Sento Dam Containment building STS-61 Stirling engine Nuclear reactor Chernobyl accident Loudspeaker Coffee Thermostat Toyota Prius Kitchen Rebreather Ice core Fire fighting Autonomous building Enceladus (moon) Hard disk Ozone depletion CPU cache E85 Urinary incontinence Volleyball Poker jargon Turbocharger Helium Brewery Refrigeration Frost Door Transformer Vacuum Planet of the Daleks Vacuum tube Tofu Car handling Cruising (maritime) Bong Refrigerator car Ozone hole Motor oil Steam engine Sea ice The Tomb of the Cybermen Haloalkane Traumatic brain injury Armored Core Water Diseases of the honeybee Freezer Menstrual cup Overclocking Cryonics Heat Lake Bassoon Mars Digital circuit Capacitor plague Elevator RuneScape quests Flood geology Dialysis Food storage Windows Vista Climate of the United Kingdom Severe weather terminology (United States) Diving suit Glossary of firefighting equipment Ammonia Fast bowling Heinkel He 112 Embedded system

before house is sold i'm moving hrs away i will return occasionally so want to leave on water gas and electric what things can i do to prevent any damage it's still my primary residence do i need to let insurance company know that i'm not living there all the time it's in your best interest to have the utilities turned on so prospective buyers can check that it has hot water the air conditioning works the stove works the shower works etc if someone else is showing your house to prospective buyers then talk to them about how comfortable they are with turning on the water gas and electric before they show it if they are able to turn on the utilities as needed then you should be o k closing the main water and gas valves and shutting off the main electric breaker however it is not uncommon for the utilities to be off during the initial visits then turned on for the official home inspection it is a good idea to discuss your options during the pre sale period with your insurance agent you probably won't have any problems with home insurance since you say the home is still your primary residence however if it looks vacant no furniture and such and you are living someplace else and something happens then you might have a problem getting your insurance company to honor a claim if you foresee extended periods of time when you will not be at the house and it will not be shown for sale then definitely talk to the insurance agent about this and you may want to check on the possibility of temporarily suspending utility service people with winter and summer homes often have arrangements with the utility companies to temporarily suspend service or go on a lower rate during periods of inactivity best wishes with the home sale and for your future plans  Insurance Life insurance Manitoba Hydro Solar power Nuclear power phase-out Mortgage Thermal power station Renewable energy Nuclear power Kitchen Toyota Prius Thermostat Annuity Microeconomics Circuit breaker CPU cache E85 Inventory Furnace Fire extinguisher Space Shuttle program Cruising (maritime) Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Real estate broker Carburetor Pebble bed reactor Energy development Brewery 2003 North America blackout Oakland Athletics Privatization Turbocharger Contract LiveJournal Air conditioning Fire fighting Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Space disaster NASDAQ Berkshire Hathaway Internal combustion engine Security (finance) Apollo 13 Stock Steam engine Enron Corporation Wal-Mart Gold standard Fuel cell Hydropower Plame affair Economy of Nigeria Citigroup Three Mile Island Publicly funded medicine Incandescent light bulb Bay Area Rapid Transit Autonomous building Blackjack Seismic retrofit Primerica Financial Services Hurricane Rita Vacuum Ford Motor Company Gasoline Daylight saving time Glossary of wildland fire terms Prostate cancer Sauna Central processing unit Capitalism Intellectual property Glossary of firefighting equipment Home repair Unemployment benefit Four-stroke cycle Futures contract Stirling engine Edward Gibbon Wakefield Heat Year 2000 problem Diving cylinder Hydrogen economy Safety engineering FairTax Glossary of firefighting terms Economics United Kingdom corporation tax Keynesian economics

pvc won't stay connected we're laying a septic line and for some reason i can't get my second pipe to bond it's pvc so it's a bit heavy and hard to work with i line it up to the fitting and my husband pushes it in while turning is there a better way we're not pros but we're not novices either we've done this many times with smaller pvc help as i've already said we've done this many times before with smaller pvc the first one bonded it should go without saying we know how to use the primer glue we know how to do this we just don't know why this one isn't bonding zonerider thank you so much it's very humid here today raining off and on also we didn't clean it enough after the first try so it's no wonder it didn't work after subsequent tries hello what schedule of pipe are you using schedule usually if you don't get a bond on the first try it's best to pull the sections apart and reclean them depending on the bonding agent you are using you may have to use naptha or paint thinner or something else a cleaner should be listed on the adhesive container when i want to be sure only to have to make the repair one time i pull the parts apart wipe up all of the adhesive i can use a cleaner safe for plastic goo gone works well once the both pieces of pipe have been cleaned and dried take a good piece of fine grit sandpaper and go over both pipes make sure your get all of the way into the receiving pipe now coat both pipes with purple primer go an inch beyond the area that will be covered when the pipes are assembled and let it dry recoat both pipes with purple make sure you don't see lighter streakes through the top coat if you do continue coating until even apply liberal amounts of adhesive to the male pipe and a thin coat of adhesive to the female section use a continuous circular motion and make the coat even don't let it goop up or puddle rotate the pipes as you apply if necessary after both sections are evenly coated push and twist you should feel the two pieces wanting to seperate smaller diameter pipes are usually held for appx seconds but be prepared to hold a pipe to seconds you may have to hold an additional amount of time depending on humidity if you have high humidity it is very important to apply the adhesive quickly and seat the pipes as quickly as a final precaution make sure that the adhesive you are using doesn't require you to allow it to set up for a minute or longer before you make the connection there are products on the market that require either making quick connection or need to set up before connecting i hope this helps i'm in the middle of reblumbing my parents house  Drill bit Domestic water system Strap-on dildo Plastic Screw Internal ballistics Floppy disk Bong Violin Seismic retrofit M16 (rifle) Aluminium Amateur telescope making Friction Table tennis Thermal power station Sandpaper Mouse (computing) Bicycle frame Epoxy Light-emitting diode Knife Dog agility Carburetor Radio controlled airplane Car handling Poker jargon Handloading Wood Table saw Tire Printed circuit board Brazing Mattress Paint Brewery Hand grenade Ammunition Irrigation Glossary of firefighting equipment Adhesive Pottery Drag racing Airsoft Wind turbine Soldering Wire Diving suit Manifold Tobacco Lionel Corporation Laserdisc Gramophone record Guitar Vacuum cleaner Clarinet Equine conformation Bulk vending Cello Upholstery Turbocharger Harp Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Bicycle Rolling-element bearing Solar cell Japanese tea ceremony Explosive material Wok Carbon dioxide Compact disc Rail terminology Paintball Terminal ballistics Woodworking Energy development Cartridge (firearms) Drainage Sewage treatment Transformer Circuit design 24 Hours of Le Mans Aerial (dance move) Hamster Primer (paint) Glass Carpet Titanium Apollo Command/Service Module Menstrual cup Cocaine Anchor Manicure

what is the easiest way to figure out mark and cut a long radius on ceramic tile you will want to clamp the tile down on a piece of plywood then just use a string tied to a pencil that is nailed down to the plywood you can find the radius the same way just use something heavy to pin the end of the string and keep moving it around and adjusting the length of the string to match the radius of the object to be avoided is it concave or convex concave means you will cut from the center of the tile convex means that you will cut the corners away from the tile convex it the easiest because you simply cut relief cuts to the line cut little lines from the outside of the tile to the arc line these reduce the chance of breaking the tile and make cutting the arc possible for concave you will have to make a ton of relief cuts you will want to use a pair of nips to break away the extra without nipping too far towards the arc line then use the blade to smooth out the arc be careful and take your time on this one  Tile Knife Collision detection Ulna Woodworking Glossary of graph theory Radius (bone) Drill bit Seismic retrofit Humerus Scapula Carpus Equine conformation Mattress Textile manufacturing Regular polytope Mandible Dominoes Sternum Polygon Tibia Lens (optics) Stairway Table tennis Amateur telescope making Manifold Welding Screw Convex Glossary of Riemannian and metric geometry Avalanche Grind Geodesic dome Lawn mower Dinghy Circle Sword Space Shuttle program Mahjong B__zier curve TGV Parallax Eyepiece Sextant Temporal bone Violin Table saw Drawing Snooker Antenna (radio) Wallpaper group Plough Ra (board game) Tessellation Stage lighting Boat building Reflecting telescope Cissoid of Diocles M.C.

toliet why won't it stop running i know it sound like not much of a problem and it hasn't been but tonight my yr old son put to much tp in it and i wasn't paying attention to the noise cuz of the washer and flooded our bathroom not so good so this is a top problem now does anyone know how to fix this lol hopefully the plugged toilet was just too much tp and not a toy jammed somewhere in the toilet drain or trap the problem of the toilet running all the time is probably one of four things the water pressure is too high and forces the ballcock flush valve to open periodically water is coming up over the overflow tube because it is too short has slipped down or the float is damaged or not adjusted properly and not shutting off the flush valve and letting too much water refill the tank the tank ball flapper is not seating properly the flush valve is damaged or leaking and is not shutting off when the tank is full the most likely problem is either or so i will start with them a website like http www toiletology com can provide diagrams and instructions on how to address these and various other toilet issues the least expensive repair is to replace the flapper you can look at the flapper and see if it is torn or rotted and replace it if it is if the flapper looks o k but water level in the tank drops slowly and you hear the flush valve open and let more water in the tank then the flapper isn't sealing if the seat the one under the flapper at the bottom of the tank feels smooth then the flapper may be damaged or become hard with age and should be replaced if the seat is rough or damaged then it needs to be replaced if the water level in the tank slowly rises even though the float stops rising and water goes over the overflow tube then the flush valve may not be closing off the water flow and it needs to be replaced there are repair kits for some flush valve assemblies but it's usually easier to just replace the whole assembly another possible cause if the tank doesn't stop filling and water goes into the overflow tube is either because the float ball is damaged and not floating well or sinks or it is not adjusted correctly keeps on rising and not shutting off the water flow at the right time if the water level in the tank is about the same as it usually is usually there are stains on the tank wall that show where the usual water level is but the water goes into the overflow tube then the tube may have slipped down or broken off and needs to be replaced finally chances are the water pressure isn't too high unless something has happened with the municipal water supply or your pump if on a well again this is rare so if it appears to be the problem then i would recheck the other possible problems before i called a plumber or the water supplier this answer is pretty long but hopefully something here proves helpful again checkout the website http www toiletology com for lots of good toilet tips and repair instructions  Siphon Thermal power station Plumbing fixture Rebreather Vacuum tube Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Seismic retrofit Sewage treatment Urinary incontinence Poker jargon Naval mine Home repair Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Hydraulic machinery Tire Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Japanese toilet Toilet humour Bong Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Autonomous building Urinal Electrophysiology Toilet Diving regulator Brewery Trombone USS Tunny (SS-282) E85 Scuba set Spark plug Steam engine Irrigation Menstrual cup Thermostat Domestic water system Cruising (maritime) Motorcycle Space shuttle main engine Combine (Half-Life 2) Dam Fast bowling Carnivorous plant Fecal incontinence Strap-on dildo USS Albacore (SS-218) Condom CPU cache Dialysis Toilet paper Diesel engine Shaggy dog story Equine conformation Safety engineering Drill bit Trumpet Panama Canal Diving suit Programmable logic controller Oscilloscope Tank Four-stroke cycle Pump M16 (rifle) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Turbocharger Three Mile Island Heinkel He 100 Team Fortress Classic Basement Novelty (locomotive) Autogyro PID controller Eye Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Fire fighting Tap (valve) Glossary of firefighting equipment Water hammer USS Yorktown (CV-5) Diving Central processing unit Tampon B-47 Stratojet Fuel injection Buffer overflow Soldering Indianapolis 500 Heart valve Gasoline USS Trigger (SS-237) Diving cylinder

re starting an empty swimming pool we recently moved into a house that has an inground swimming pool the pool hasn't been used in about years we drained the pool and were looking to re open it with new water and equipment we don't really know anything about pools the pool is about ft deep at the deep end about how much do you think it would cost to open this pool for the remainder of the season and is it worth it well first things first some of the equipment might still be usable if your pool motor starts when you turn it on then it should be ok dont fix it if it aint broke new motor pump is probably going to cost you at least bucks without even considering size of the pump you need if you have a foot deep pool you might as well consider that you have thousand gallons of water check your filter if you have a diatomaceous earth filter or d e as it is known you will most likely want to replace the filter grid media as the nylon fabric is probably going to have holes throughout the fabric which means your water will not filter properly if you have a sand filter you are going to want to change the sand that sand is probably dirty to begin with and could have mold and or other growths in it from sitting for so long now the most important thing is this your inground pool is like a boat if you do not fill the pool with water you risk the pool floating on the groundwater in spring or fall etc i cant say definitively that this will happen but this is one reason why an inground pool is never completely drained for long periods of time if this does happen your pool could come up inches from your decking almost as if your pool decking has sunken around the pool and it might only happen on one end which means that you are going to have uneven water so if your pool only has a skimmer and its on the end that lifts and raises you could have plumbing problems and also that your pool on the lower end will probably need to be filled almost to the brim of the coping stones just to give your skimmer enough water to supply your pump being foot deep i would have to assume that there is a main drain in the bottom but i have seen them without on occasions now if your pool is empty and you have cleaned it out you wont get every little bit and cranny of debris out but if you have hosed it down and gotten rid of almost all the water in the deep end you can start filling it anytime if you have a main drain and you have a shut off for the skimmers in the pump area you can run the pool once y ou get about feet of water in the deep end and this way your water will filter as you fill it this will speed up the process of cleaning the water once your pool is filled open the skimmers and let the skimmers work as well after a day of running hours since you have had the water filtering with the main drain take a ounce soda bottle nad about elbows length with the bottle upside down with air filling the bottle turn the bottle over to fill make sure you rinse this bottle in the water a few times you dont want any soda contamination in your sample take this to your pool store and yes they are going to sell you every chemical you can think of but remember its new water and hasnt been treated for swimming pool use yet you are going to need lots of things to get it pool ready the advantage of doing all of this now is that when you open the pool in the spring unless you live in an area where you keep it open all year you wont have to do too much to balance the water just make sure that when you take your water sample in tell them its new water as the pool was empty so they can test for everything especially iron copper or manganese you dont want to add any chlorine to the water if these metals are present and once you get this done you should be good to go hope this helps  Water purification Brewery Swimming pool Marine aquarium Carburetor Glossary of firefighting equipment Thermal power station Sewage treatment Coffee Motor oil E85 Drainage Dairy Glass

inside ac unit leaking water its a split unit and its the unit that is inside the house that is leaking water i understand that condensation will build up and water is supposed to run of into a pan but its actually running off everywhere and is causing the carpet to be wet the unit is inside the hall way in its own closet space and behind the filter i can see just a build up of water and there is a pipe that comes off the unit and goes up about a foot or two when i took the cap off the pipe water just started overflowing out of the pipe sorry im not able to get too technical i honestly dont know much about this basically i dont know anything but if its something that i can fix then i would like to fix it myself either your drain is plugged or it's out of pitch for a plugged drain you need to probe the pipe and see if something fell into the pipe or if something was put in the pipe an electricians snake works well for this operation first place to look is where the pipe connects to the drain pan sometimes mice like to use these spots as a place to store things if the pipes big enough there could be a trapped mouse dead in it there could be anything in it you never know a pipe that s out of pitch could be due to a bad installation or an accident knocking it out of kilter these pipes are supposed to have a slight pitch away from the unit to encourage drainage to the outside i once had a pipe that was knocked out of pitch when my brother helped lay insulation batts it was a plastic pipe he picked it up to lay a batt and forgot to move it back in position check those two things plugged drain or pipe out of pitch  Basement Thermal power station Plumbing fixture Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Domestic water system Solar power Carburetor Flush toilet Spark plug Motor oil Bong Siphon Electrical wiring Universal Serial Bus Drainage Plastic Pipe organ Autonomous building Glossary of firefighting equipment Kitchen Fast bowling Windows 2000 E85 Seismic retrofit Hamster BS 1363 Sewer Piccolo Junior Saga Passive solar Air conditioning Hydraulic ram Reading spark plugs for racing Dundas Square Apollo 13 Rebreather Electrical wiring (UK) Two-stroke cycle Columbine High School massacre The Inside Irrigation RuneScape locations 2005 Maharashtra floods 2000 Australian Grand Prix Apollo Guidance Computer Vacuum tube Cruising (maritime) Diving Commodore 64 Tire Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Ship Teller-Ulam design HVAC GunZ The Duel Fire fighting Dairy Screw Roof and tunnel hacking Glossary of firefighting terms Strap-on dildo Rail terminology STS-51-L Modem Soldering USB flash drive Fossil fuel power plant Heat Aerial (dance move) Diving regulator Caving Japanese toilet RBMK Residual-current device Software bug Pan American World Airways MDAC Motorcycle Action potential Stage lighting Fire hydrant Rose (Doctor Who) Windows XP Carbon dioxide Ground and neutral Unreal Insulation Atari 8-bit family Baroque chess Brewery John Cage Geography of Africa Sewage treatment Suicide methods RuneScape Mini-Games Harp Traumatic brain injury Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Hebden Bridge

how do i get rid of dirty walls it is in every room it isnt a think film it looks like dust but then you start wipeing it and realize all you have done is move it around i dont smoke i have tried the magic eraser clorox w bleach and they dont work how to clean dirty plaster walls when ordinary cleaners don't work stubborn stains on plaster often can be scrubbed away with a strong solution of trisodium phosphate tsp and water or a non phosphate substitute unpainted plaster is porous but generally non soluble and unless you really drown the wall it can take a good bath and rinse drywall has a paper coating and its gypsum base is water soluble and water can penetrate a thin coat of paint so be careful not to treat it the same way scrub drywall gently with a soft sponge and a mild tsp solution and try not to use too much water let the drywall dry thoroughly and consider repainting with a higher gloss paint that resists stains and is easier to clean  Drywall Trisodium phosphate Phosphoric acid Gypsum Paint Drill bit Plaster Menstrual cup Casting Dishwashing Pottery Stucco Dishwasher Laundry detergent Tooth enamel Genericized trademark Masonry Phosphate Plating Titanium Sento Upholstery Ammonia Car washing techniques Home repair Wok Vacuum cleaner Sulfuric acid Alabaster Traveling salesman problem Fecal incontinence Psoriasis Bong Sodium hypochlorite Mortar (masonry) Lionel Corporation E-6 process Hydrogen peroxide Soldering First aid Wood Brazing Swimming pool Wallpaper Dietary fiber Strap-on dildo Printmaking Stan Ridgway Soluble Glass Japanese tea ceremony Fire extinguisher Water (molecule) Citric acid Collodion process Gram staining Staining (biology) Plastic Hard water Cast iron Sulfur Straw-bale construction Primer (paint) Turquoise Contact lens Body piercing Glaze Japanese toilet Air pollution Vacuum Hand washing Coffee Aluminium Shroud of Turin Washing machine Chromatography Flue gas desulfurization Cellular network Customs and etiquette of Japan Fire fighting Water purification Sugar beet Fresco Cookware and bakeware Soap Carpet Phosphorus Dialysis White phosphorus incendiary Flour Hazardous waste Glycerin Toilet paper Leather Brush Toilet

our air conditioning vent makes a horrible rattling sound when the dust filter is in when we take the filter out it's quiet we've tried to figure out what's causing the problem but can't we even put a new dust filter in thinking it would help nada any help would be appreciated i had a filter in my cold air return that would do the same thing double check the size of the filter and make sure it is correct you may have to take measurements the filter probably has a metal frame as does your vent you could try getting some adhesive rubber or foam tabs and apply them to the filter frame to make it fit better also try using some weather stripping which has adhesive on one side i remember the sound and it was quite annoying good luck  Loudspeaker E85 Diving suit Upholstery Mattress Motor oil Tire Sun Air filter Tank Laserdisc Brewery Violin Car handling Bass guitar Gramophone record Carburetor Luminiferous aether Table tennis Motorcycle Apollo 8 Air pollution Hydraulic machinery Plastic Thermal power station Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Airbag Anamorphic widescreen Coffee Explosive material Kalman filter Ultraviolet Printed circuit board Dialysis Bicycle brake systems Glasses Polyurethane Big band Wrench Incandescent light bulb Fire extinguisher Radio controlled airplane Fume hood Charles Goodyear Electronic filter Bicycle frame Galileo spacecraft Amateur telescope making Glossary of firefighting equipment Many-worlds interpretation Horseshoe Global climate model Capacitor plague Low-pass filter Shit Condom Technicolor Vacuum cleaner M16 (rifle) Scale model Mount Pinatubo Compact audio cassette Menstrual cup Cello Hubble Space Telescope Polarization Clementine mission Social rule Hubble Deep Field Friction MOS Technology SID Drill bit Cocaine Movie projector Debugging Welding Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Sunglasses HVAC Roswell UFO incident Bicycle helmet Computer cooling Adhesive Casting Bayesian probability Forcing (mathematics) Space disaster Mooney M20 Hard disk Particulate Cannabis cultivation NTSC Diving regulator COBE 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Space Shuttle external tank Stealth technology ZX Spectrum

want to play judge and help me settle a dispute right after completion of a home that was built the customer moved furniture into it there was a leaking pipe upstairs and it caused water damage through the ceiling to the bottom level of the home where it leaked onto a used leather couch the next day the contracter sent the plumber sheet rockers and painters out to make all of the repairs everything was done quickly and efficiently within the next days however there was water damage to the leather couch the couch is used and has some dog scratches and worn places after the water dried there was a light mark about the size of a large pan on the upper corner the contractor volunteered to have it cleaned which would cost about including pick up and delivery or give the customer the cash outright to put towards the purchase of a new couch the customer feels that the contractor should pay for a brand new couch what do you think as a former contractor myself i will side with the contractor and so will a judge the reason being is that the contractor did everything in his power to rectify the problem the contractor wasn't trying to deny or get out of anything he sent in sub contractors to repair the situation and made efforts to have it cleaned or replaced at a fair market value for a couch in used condition with previous damage already you can take this to small claims court but will lose because of your unwillingness to settle with reasonable terms the judge will ask you if the contractor made the efforts necessary to correct the problem and when you say yes he will dismiss the case because of the contractor's efforts and the timely fashion in which the other repairs were made i'm sure that the contractor is licensed and bonded which will exonerate him and maintain his reputation of years of being in business and willingness to take care of the problem therefore you will come out on the losing end and the as well if the couch had been newly reupholstered and was verified as an antique you might have had a case  Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Seismic retrofit Welding Tire SCO-Linux controversies Kitchen Nuclear power Home repair United States Postal Service Babylonian law Insurance Contract Scientology beliefs and practices Dairy Inflation Violin The Apprentice 2 Public good Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sento Boeing Carburetor Upholstery Manitoba Hydro Brewery Natural monopoly Public domain M16 (rifle) CPU design Intellectual property Mediation Thermal power station Atari 8-bit family Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans AMD Heinkel He 100 Mattress Security (finance) Citigroup Space Shuttle program Urinary incontinence E85 Mortgage Menstrual cup Shoe Fecal incontinence Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Plame affair FairTax ITV Property (ownership right) Medical malpractice Fair use Toyota Prius Wayne Corporation Apollo Command/Service Module Surveillance Oil-for-Food Programme Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Debt Gramophone record BAE Systems Microeconomics Leather Heinkel He 112 Clothing Schabir Shaik Trial Public-key cryptography Chair View camera Energy development Ford Motor Company Sears Holdings Corporation Diamond Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Blenheim Palace Equine conformation Volleyball Hamster Child support Management information system Information Technology Infrastructure Library Stanley Cup Negligence Airbus Delta Air Lines Berkshire Hathaway Boeing 747 Corporate personhood Trademark Gold standard Chernobyl accident

induction cooktop blows internal fuse i have acquired a used kenmore induction cooktop from someone that says the two small burners work fine but when he turns on the larger burners they blow the small a fuse inside not the fuse in his house i haven't hooked it up to our wiring yet which meets the requirements for this cooktop and i haven't looked inside it yet what do you think the problem could be so i know what to look for could his wiring have caused it his house is of an era that used aluminum wiring and may have not had the required dedicated a circuit bad power module bad capacitor something specific to induction cooking technology should i check for something in particular before i hook it up to my house and see if the larger burners work here anybody have similiar problems with an induction cooking unit thanks i suppose i should add this unit has two power modules with one small and one large burner going to each module i don't have a manual but i do have a parts diagram and parts list and the previous owner gave me extra fuses the fuses he gave me do match the ones listed on the part list so it's probably not an improper fuse of course there may be a short circuit in wiring to the big burners it is possible though that the fuse is of the improper rating if the fuse blows when the burners are not turned on it must be a short circuit it could be in the feed to either or both burner switches or the branch to one burner switch if it does not blow when only one burner is turned on but does on the other you can guess where the trouble is if it blows only when both are turned on it is likely that the fuse is of too low a rating  Fuse (electrical) Electric motor Circuit design Thermal power station Electronic amplifier Electrophysiology Antenna (radio) Portable stove Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Tesla coil Gas metal arc welding Vacuum tube X10 (industry standard) Stove Capacitor Loudspeaker BS 1363 Thermostat Circuit breaker Transistor Poker jargon Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Fluorescent lamp Switched-mode power supply Web crawler Alternating current Atari 8-bit family Apollo Guidance Computer Integrated circuit Nuclear weapon design High-voltage direct current Furnace Welding Inductor Nuclear fusion Incandescent light bulb Digital circuit Internal ballistics Solar cell Modem Computer Operational amplifier Central processing unit CMOS Jet engine Printed circuit board Cookware and bakeware Buffer overflow Electrical generator Floppy disk Dimmer National Electrical Code (US) Diode Spacecraft propulsion Perl Capacitor plague Series and parallel circuits Amiga DVD Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Ethernet CPU cache Apollo 13 Dynamic random access memory Kitchen Battery (electricity) Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Firearm Hydraulic machinery Optical fiber Telephone exchange Internal combustion engine Microphone Action potential Logic gate Cray-1 IBM 1620 Cerebellum Advanced Squad Leader Residual-current device Relay Space disaster Phase-shift keying Motorcycle Wind turbine Railgun Hot air balloon Lightning ITU-T Electric power transmission Lineman (occupation) Electrical wiring

i had a huge puddle of water coming from underneath my refridgerator this morning what is wrong with it the drip pan is probably overflowing the drip pan is a shallow flat pan that slides in under the bottom and is used to catch condensation every time you open the door it lets warm humid air in and the refrigeration condenses this humidity and it runs down and collects in a large flat pan underneath normally the water just evaporates but if you have had a lot of very humid days and were opening the doors a lot it might cause excessive condensation to overflow the pan you can slide the pan out to empty and clean it usually collects dust also if you have an ice maker check in the back to see that the plastic hose it's small about in diameter is not leaking somewhere this hose will connect to a water line somewhere and there might be a problem with a clamp coupling  Irrigation Bong Heat exchanger Air conditioning Thermal power station Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Dairy Brewery Coffee Carbon dioxide Carburetor Rain Flush toilet Water vapor Glacier Movie projector Intravenous therapy Severe weather terminology (United States) Rebreather Aerial (dance move) Solar power Glossary of firefighting equipment Electrophysiology Autonomous building HVAC Fossil fuel power plant Ocean thermal energy conversion Vacuum cleaner Cruising (maritime) Diving regulator Steam engine Relative humidity Cookware and bakeware Refrigerator Town gas Carnivorous plant Drill bit Phase (matter) Water Humidity Floppy disk Violin Hydroponics Steam locomotive nomenclature Canal lock Capacitor Swamp cooler Siphon Scuba set Seismic retrofit Glossary of firefighting terms Furnace Nuclear fallout Motor oil Menstrual cup Ice cream Fujian tea ceremony Dialysis Opportunity rover Desert Cyclone Wok Equine conformation Fire fighting Basement Urinary incontinence Clarinet Fishing Houseplant Weather lore Hydraulic machinery The Amber Spyglass Energy development Solar system Poker jargon Trapping E85 Amateur telescope making GLOCK Plastic Condensed milk Microphone Cloud Ice core 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Kitchen Suppressor Skateboarding trick Mars Dam Wine making Blood Simple Pachypodium Glossary of wildland fire terms Gas absorption refrigerator Climate of Salt Lake City Circuit design Elevator

question about water damage in my apartment i live in a townhome i was changing the water in my aquarium i had a bucket of water sitting on a chair my cat came along jumped onto the bucket and knocked it over i noticed a few hours later that there was water spots on my ceiling down in the living room i put a fan on the water spot upstairs and it dryed pretty fast can i just pain over those spots with a special kind of paint this didn't cause any severe damage under the carpet did it just wondering what the best way was to take care of this situation without owing my apartment complex add info this happened about months ago it's completely dry its a light tan color on the ceiling there isn't a moldy mildew smell in the room upstairs the carpet looks normal maybe a taaad discolored but we plan on having the carpet replaced before our lease is up anyway this will cause a water spot on your ceiling if you want to fix it you will need to paint kilz a stain blocker let it dry then you'll need to paint it you'll probably have to paint the whole ceiling because the fresh paint will show they make kilz in a spray can and you might try just touching up the stain area so it's not noticeable or just take the chance the apt mgr won't notice it when you move out just be certain the carpet dries keep the fan on it until it's completly dry  Paint Sento Volleyball Fire fighting Upholstery The Inside Milton H.

how to remove marks from a wooden floor i have a lot of marks on my floor from the plastic wheels on my sofa i have tried warn soapy water but doesn't work anyone got any ideas of best solution to remove these i recently had a similar problem with a wooden end table i had a friend over to my apartment and instead of using the coasters i had provided she put her drinking glass on a folded paper napking thinking that this would prevent damage to the wood well upon picking up the glass there was a noticeable water mark on the wood as soon as i saw the damage i rubbed some liquid gold a wood preservative available in man stores and fortunately it did the trick i believe part of the success was due to the fact that i caught the problem with a relatively short period of time how long ago did the problem appear p s water damages wood unless you use a wood soap such as murphy's oil soap try an oil soap and then the liquid gold and let us know whether you were successful  Textile manufacturing Drill bit Sento Hamster Mattress Water Chair Woodworking The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Solar power Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Manicure Kitchen Sodium chloride Plastic Seismic retrofit Cryonics Dishwashing Glycerin Beer Shaggy dog story Carbon dioxide Fire Fancy rat Knoebels Naval mine Wood Sewage treatment Tattoo Corrosion Milk Fecal incontinence Genericized trademark Confidence trick Nuclear power The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Poker jargon Characters in the Smurfs Knife Gold standard Hydrochloric acid Soap bubble Combine (Half-Life 2) Sodium Door Deforestation Roller coaster Renewable energy The Inside Shampoo Japanese tea ceremony Violin Cha chaan teng Chopsticks Cruising (maritime) Water purification About a Boy Ultraviolet Computer virus EastEnders Solvent Tire Firefighter Soap opera Wok Transformation problem Solution Inflation Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Rum Escalator Urinary incontinence Olive oil Hand washing Glasses Floppy disk The Time Machine Pottery Vinegar The X-Files (season 1) Nunchaku RuneScape skills Neighbours Hash table Kayak Skateboarding trick Geodesic dome Lathe Thief (computer game) Coffee Golf Sulfuric acid Acne Brewery Philosophy of space and time Keynesian economics

we need our landlord to upgrade fix some stuff can he charge us for them our carpet was never replaced before we moved in we have a screen door that has been broken forever and we want to ask our landlord to put in a new working screen door and new carpeting we've been here for more than years and the carpets are so worn out and have a bunch of stains from the old tenant but can he charge us to get these done your landlord doesn't have to do anything for you and in fact this is one way to get rid of a tenant unless you have something in your lease that specifies that he has to change your carpet there's nothing you can do about it there's no such thing as a time limit anywhere that i know of usually when a new tenant moves in the carpets are cleaned that's it unless you specifically have something noted in the lease before moving in remember that magic words moving in and before usually the landlord can and will promise you certain things but can also keep you on a string by holding you off for sometimes years after all what should he go through the cost of a new carpet maintenance is another thing but if it's not life threatening you could wait for this too  Leasehold estate Leasing Rental agreement Estoppel Carpet Waste (law) Manorialism Real property Sin City Eviction Serfdom Apartment Aladdin (1992 film) Housing cooperative Home repair Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Hubert H.

electric dryer not heating i took off the back panel to check the fuse anyone know where it is it's not obvious to me and i can't find the owners manual whirlpool model lec pw the heating element in your dryer has almost certainly died however before you give up go check the breaker box to be sure that a breaker hasn't been thrown the way most dryers are wired it's as though there are two plugs in one it's completely possible for the drum to turn and yet the breaker for the heat to be thrown if the breakers fuses are ok then it's almost certainly the heating element that's pretty easy to replace they usually simply plug in to a socket inside the dryer after turning off the power to both dryer breakers you unplug the old element plug in the new one and you're set the site below is really good for diagnosing and treating your appliance woes good luck  Fuse (electrical) Residual-current device Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Distribution board Circuit breaker BS 1363 Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Three-phase electric power Spark plug Power strip Ring circuit Ground and neutral National Electrical Code (US) Solar power Armored Core Incandescent light bulb Thermal power station Extension Cord Electrician Electrical wiring (UK) Japanese toilet Electric motor Alternating current Common electrical adaptors in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom Jack plug Tire Dishwasher SCART Ground (electricity) Europlug Mains electricity Enigma machine Relay Casting Ignition system Seismic retrofit Oscilloscope X10 (industry standard) Nuclear fusion D-subminiature Universal Serial Bus Transformer Carburetor Circuit design Dimmer Pottery Fluorescent lamp Battery electric vehicle Technical standards in colonial Hong Kong Reading spark plugs for racing Aluminium Welding Electrical breakdown Embedded system TRS connector Fan (implement) Professional wrestling throws Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Steam engine Washing machine Fire Power cord Poker jargon Electric power Fire alarm control panel Oplan Bojinka Wind power Two-stroke cycle IPod Modem Appliance classes STS-61 Burglar alarm Plastic Thermostat Bill Stevenson Commodore 64 Refrigerator Theory of conduct Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) Athlon Energy development Rapid Inertial confinement fusion Electricity meter Lighting Earthing system Lawn mower Fusor Collision detection Microwave oven Rhodium Laptop RCA connector Ampere Autonomous building Potentiometer Central processing unit Canon T90

central air unit outside has dampness on the concrete around it my a c unit outside has dampness around it i live in the south where summer temperatures approach almost daily i had the unit serviced in may by someone who works as the maitenance person for an apartment complex he is also the person who installed this unit two summers ago the unit is cooling fine but all of this dampness concerns me is this normal or is something leaking that i should look into when he serviced the unit he said it was lbs low on freeon spelling i thought this was strange for a new unit is it yes it is normal the larger pipe the one with the insulation on it will gather condensate especially on the inside of the ac unit where the line is not wrapped so it is doing just what it should the fact that you were two pounds of freon low is not normal either the guy didn't put in the lbs or he did and the original installers didn't fill the freon up correct or you have a leak in the system if you have a leak that large insulated line will get a frost on it if that happens call you ac guy and have him find the leak and get it fixed or you stand the chance of freezing up the compressor  Air conditioning Refrigerator Jet engine Haloalkane Thermal power station Solar power Hydrogen economy Cray-1 HVAC Autonomous building Phase (matter) Vacuum Insulation Gas compressor Vacuum tube Passive solar Mercury Atlas 6 Fossil fuel power plant Circuit design Basement Climate of the United Kingdom Containment building Carburetor Pebble bed reactor Seismic retrofit Superconductivity Supercharger Phase change heat pump Apollo 13 Frost Carbon dioxide Heat Glass Electrical wiring Water (molecule) Asbestos Air pollution Spark plug Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Heinkel He 100 Brewery Ice cream Ocean thermal energy conversion Chevrolet Corvair engine Space Shuttle external tank Futurama (TV series - season 5) Bleed air Furnace Refrigeration Gas turbine Engine cooling Helium Diving suit Flush toilet Swamp cooler Ammonia Thermostat TGV Energy development Loudspeaker Overhead powerline Overhead lines Pound Roof and tunnel hacking Fog Huntington Beach, California Casting Electric power transmission Ice Seismometer Transformer Mars Exploration Rover Turbofan B-47 Stratojet Thunderstorm Chernobyl accident Computer cooling Air brake (rail) Fire fighting Geothermal exchange heat pump Super Mario 64 Mercury 4 Nuclear power Chevrolet Corvair Harp Knife Tire Teller-Ulam design Electricity pylon Diode Turbocharger Bong Axial compressor Fuel cell Action potential Hydropower Geology of the Moon W.

a c not working well right now can you add freon i have a window a c in which the compressor keeps cutting off and on can you add freon like you do to cars or is there something else wrong if the compressor keeps coming off and on there is a few possible reasons bad thermostat this control is mounted inside the front of your ac where the knob is that sets the temp you want the unit to cool to or the part that senses how cold it is getting is touching the front of the ac coil bad capacitor allowing unit to still start but allowing it to pull to many amps causing it to kick it overload bad overload most of these are internal and cannot be repaired if it was low on freon it would still run but it would either freeze up or not cool at all  Refrigerator Thermostat Air conditioning Phase change heat pump Cray-1 Dodge Neon Jet engine Bass guitar Supercharger Axial compressor Manual transmission Electric motor Mars Exploration Rover Electrophysiology Thermal power station Carburetor Fluorescent lamp Gas compressor Transformer Microphone Solar power HVAC Turbocharger Haloalkane Temperature Oscilloscope Turbojet Fan (implement) Volleyball Circuit breaker Honda Prelude Loudspeaker Audio level compression Glossary of American football Drifting (motorsport) Relay Heinkel He 100 SR-71 Blackbird Bi-metal Toyota Prius CDC 6600 Football (soccer) Guitar Heat Lincoln LS Tire Cooler Tesla coil CDC 7600 Turbofan Spacecraft propulsion Windows 2000 Equine conformation Marathon (computer game) Cryogenics Capacitor plague Battery (electricity) Volkswagen Passat Swimming Weather lore Chevrolet Corvair engine Internal ballistics Lighting Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Apollo 13 De Lorean DMC-12 Effects unit Dodge Charger Motor oil Inertial guidance system Ford Thunderbird Subaru Loyale M16 (rifle) Autonomous building Bicycle lighting Butterfly stroke Diving regulator Soldering Heinkel He 112 Vinyl roof Residual-current device Hydrogen economy Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Valve sound Action potential Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rugby union Chaos Emerald Poker jargon Fire fighting Mercury Atlas 6 Drill bit Dynamic random access memory Diode Cryonics Refrigeration Hurricane Katrina effects by region Circuit design Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Filling station

dirt road living sandy garage floor ideas needed i live on a dirt road therefore i bring a lot of sand in my garage from my tires needless to say the sand builds up fast does anyone have any tips or tricks that i can do in my garage to minimize the sandy floors i know i could simply sweep every day but what do others do who live on a dirt road maybe there is something that i can park on but i haven't seen anything yet ideas are appreciated thank if your drive is not paved i would recommend thinking about that especially if you have a 'long' drive like most rural homes would as opposed to a 'city' home with just a small front yard by paving either concrete ashphalt or brick pavers the driveway you give your tires more room to drop the sand dirt before you pull into the garage for a concrete floor i recommend a medium bristle push broom don't settle for one of the real coarse ones that are so common in the stores get a good one horsehair bristles are a good choice for a smooth concrete floor at a janitorial supply you will find that it moves more sand outside where you want it rather than leaving tracks of it between the bristles im afraid that anything you might put down would only trap the dirt making it more difficult to remove but there are some garage floor coatings that will 'hide' the dirt better than others you can find these at most building supply stores good luck  Road McMansion Aerial (dance move) Anchor Ridge Route Pavement (material) Tractor Road transport History of the Panama Canal Drill bit Fire fighting Seismic retrofit Radio controlled car Christmas tree Vacuum cleaner Piccolo Junior Saga The Adventures of Pete & Pete Fast bowling Gravel Fallout shelter Violin Casting Kitchen Motorcycle Street Combine (Half-Life 2) Drifting (motorsport) Volleyball Lincoln Highway Carl G.

my little sister flushed a paper towel down the toilet how can we unclog it i have a bathroom in my bedroom my little sister was in my room playing on the computer and had to use the bathroom well she didnt realize that i was out of toilet paper she found a roll of paper towles under the sink i use them to clean and used one of them the problem is that our toilets are very sensitive this happened days ago their is nothing visablly stuck in the toilet i plunged it and it went down but the water still wont go down when we flush it rises to the top and i have to turn the knob to shut the water off before the toilet over flows after i shut the water off i go away for about an hour the water slowly drains from the toilet and then i turn the water back on let it fill up and try flushing it again i'm assuming that the paper towel got cloged somwhere further down than what i can see i dont want to tell my mom quite yet becuase my step dad will yell at both my sister and i i'm years old shes how can i avoid needing a plummer i've tried plunging and that isnt seeming to work should i wait a while and then try plunging again somebody said that within time the paper towel will dissolve and it'll unclog is that true we have a lot of bathrooms in my house so its not that big of a deal if mine isnt working for a few more days its an inconvience but i didnt always live in a house where i had my own bathroom anyways should i keep trying to re flush after the water fills up or should i just let it sit i think liquid bleach will corrode the fibers in the paper towel the fibers at this point are already weakened from soaking in water bleach will weaken them even further and fast too i think this because i've seen what straight bleach can do to a sponge good luck  Menstrual cup Japanese toilet Toilet Toilet paper Urinal Bathroom Flush toilet Textile manufacturing Fecal incontinence Married... with Children Washroom Tampon Paper Siphon Sewage treatment Toilet humour Sento Menstrual cycle Brewery Poker jargon Diaper Shaggy dog story Sanitary towel Cannabis cultivation Water Coriolis effect Towel The Brady Bunch CPU cache Thermal power station Dishwashing Fire fighting Manicure Rebreather Dormitory Upholstery Draw poker Psycho Dialysis Toilet-related injury The Shining (film) Ron Weasley The Inside Wood pulp Nirvana (band) Bleach (manga) Composting toilet Kitchen Blood Simple Sauna Carburetor Domestic water system Paper towel Mattress Aerial (dance move) Soldering Hamster Futurama (TV series - season 2) The Adventures of Pete & Pete Disinfection Friends Drag racing Trisodium phosphate She Loves You Drainage Sewer Cruising (maritime) Starsiege: Tribes The Family from One End Street Autonomous building Ammonia Piccolo Junior Saga Urinary incontinence Thomas Crapper The Fairly OddParents Corrosion Make money fast Euphemism IRT Flushing Line Ocean thermal energy conversion Dairy Equine conformation Bristol Grammar School Recurring South Park characters The Curse of Fenric Tag Massage Water purification EastEnders Big Brother (Australian TV series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Basement Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Tattoo

heat pump return suction the return suction on my heat pump ac is so strong it literally pulls the filter out of its frame what causes this and how do i fix it the ac guy installed another return to help with the airflow but it still pulls one or the other out of place both air returns are x and the unit is a ton thanks the unit is pulling to much air the most likely problem is that they did not calculate the cfm of air needed for the unit and the motor is blowing to much air does it blow air out of the vents very hard if yes then motor is running on to high a speed if no then there is to many cold air vents for the system and it is not allowing the unit to build any back pressure have them come back and check the cfm of the air and set motor accordingly  Vacuum cleaner Jet engine Thermal power station Air conditioning Solar power Diesel engine HVAC Vacuum Stirling engine Fan (implement) Bong Furnace Glossary of firefighting equipment Swamp cooler Turbojet Fuel injection Hydraulic machinery Axial compressor Fossil fuel power plant Locomotive Manifold vacuum Wind Hard disk Glider Autonomous building Saturn V Bicycle brake systems Suction Timeline of steam power Siphon Ocean thermal energy conversion Gliding Pump Explosive material TGV Heinkel He 100 Motorcycle Geothermal exchange heat pump Phase change heat pump Internal combustion engine Parachute Aircraft engine controls Combine harvester Hot air balloon Dodge Neon Electric motor Mooney M20 Renewable energy Novelty (locomotive) Equine conformation Variometer Cavitation Diving suit Brewery E85 Dialysis Initiation (phonetics) Space Shuttle external tank Drill bit 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Three-phase electric power Spacecraft propulsion Mitsubishi 3000GT Turbocharger Newcomen steam engine Three Mile Island Movie projector Aerodynamics Paragliding Anchor Fire fighting Automatic transmission George Westinghouse Abortion Lift (force) STS-61 Energy development Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Tire Infusion pump Lung Sewage treatment Glossary of firefighting terms Aircraft engine Tier One Glossary of wildland fire terms Chevrolet Corvair USS S-32 (SS-137) Welding Drowning Gas compressor Wind power Messerschmitt Bf 109 Ford Ranger EV

what is the difference between lumber drier and a torrefaction a machine for making thermo lumber i am working in a lumber company and we want to buy a drier to produce thermo lumber we were adviced to use the torrefaction i dont know the exact difference between a drier and a torrefaction i guess the drier works at a lower temperature so that we decrease the moisture or humidity and then we use the torrefaction to make the moisture humidity reaches i hope anyone can help me to know more info about this i will be thankful if someone can tell me about companies which sells driers and torrefactions i really appreciate your help and thank u torrefaction involves heating wood at relatively high temperatures to improve the properties of the wood without the addition of chemicals or toxic substances the process is different from heat treatment in that it is done in an oxygen deprived environment to prevent the wood from igniting which means it is possible to heat the wood to temperatures of between c and c at these temperatures the molecular structure of the wood is altered enhancing some of the wood s physical properties specifically its colour dimensional stability and resistance to fungal decay more efficient than drying torrefaction eliminates the water and sap present in the wood along with the adsorbed water contained in the wood cells reducing the moisture content of wood to practically  Wood Air conditioning Carbon dioxide Lumber Corrosion Hydrogen Pottery Hydrogen peroxide Solar power Alcohol fuel Fiberglass Thermodynamics Gasoline Water Water (molecule) Global warming and agriculture Plastic Ammonia Nutrition Temperature Deforestation Polyethylene terephthalate Sewage treatment Aluminium Transformer Alkane Humidity E85 Carbon Solar cell Renewable energy Plutonium Phase (matter) Epoxy Alcohol Helium Sterilization (microbiology) Ecology Sulfur Motor oil Acetic acid Haloalkane Energy development Chemistry Polychlorinated biphenyl Ceramics Hydrogen economy Rocket fuel Nuclear power Food preservation Psoriasis Portland cement Hyperthermia Chemical reaction Breathing gas Fire fighting Methanol Desert Technetium Manganese Biochemistry Carnivorous plant DNA repair Coffee Cancer Uranium Fire extinguisher Straw-bale construction Nuclear magnetic resonance Brewery Ozone depletion Iron Dehumidifier Autonomous building Water vapor Radiometric dating Enzyme Diseases of the honeybee Stainless steel Moisturizer Hydrochloric acid Entropy Spectroscopy Exergy Spark plug Diamond Water purification Wood pulp Decomposition Oxygen sensor Heat index

how much does it cost to fix if your central ac is froze up just curious also how can you tell when you're not being taken advantage of price wise when they do a repair they did a check over the phone to try and determine what is wrong and this is what they think it is from me telling them what's going on over the phone is there anyway to prevent this from happening in the future the cost is directly related to what is causing it to be froze up there is only a few possible reasons for a unit to freeze up dirty filter or a coil low on freon restricted air movement you can clean the coil your self if your mechanically inclined to have a serviceman to clean it would cost depending on what your local hvac dealer charges for the service call and per hour labor plus parts i charge dollars for the first hour and dollars for each additional hour the cleaner is about dollars per gallon and freon is about per pound if you need it so if you don't need nothing but a good cleaning it could cost to dollars  Inflation Air conditioning Euro Microeconomics HVAC Mattress Dry cleaning Public transport Supply and demand North American Numbering Plan E85 Filling station Broadband Internet access GSM services Fuel injection Refrigerator Haloalkane FairTax Pound sterling Gold standard Battery (electricity) Solar power Deflation (economics) Carburetor Welding United States dollar Transformer Blackjack Diablo II: Lord of Destruction M16 (rifle) Short message service Arbitrage Digital photography Price discrimination Dairy ITunes Music Store Thermal power station CPU cache Daylight saving time Galileo spacecraft Microphone Labor theory of value Bulk vending Mutual fund Bretton Woods system Laserdisc Argentine Currency Board Hard disk Capitalism Space Shuttle program Social rule Vacuum cleaner Virgin Mobile Autonomous building Economy of the United States Biodiesel Cable television The Price Is Right STS-87 Telephone numbering plan Illegal drug trade Coffee Thermostat Avalanche Surplus value Poker jargon Equine conformation Dollar store Monopoly Fluorescent lamp Elevator Toyota Prius Sugar beet Arguments for and against drug prohibition Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

do i need to replace my heating element i have a dryer used only times but over a year old nd home at first dryer wouldn't heat up i replaced resettable switches limit switch i think and then electric dryer heated up but now it gets so hot you can't touch the dryer and blows the thermal fuse within minutes if i bypass thermal fuse not safe i know it will run but the heat will burn you the heating element ohms out but could it still be bad what am i missing here there is not but so many parts and i have replaced thermal fuse times and the two other switches once whirlpool according to best buy won't do anything because it is over months old can i fix it or am i better off with a new dryer i have check vents they are clear and plumbed with hard metal not flex duct sounds like the cycling switch thermostat is bad or is the wrong one should be two thermostats high limit degrees or higher cycling switch usually to degrees and one thermal fuse if the thermal fuse is blowing this indicates either one of the limits is bad or to high a temp the cycling switch should be mounted where the air exists the dryer so it can sense the dryer temp the high limit is usually mounted at the bottom of the element and the thermal fuse should be mounted close to the cycling limit if the dryer is getting hot the element is not bad i would check the cycling switch as it is obviously not working or to high a temp whirlpool sells a kit that has all three items in one bag to replace your existing ones the cycling limit switch controls the drum temperature the high limit protects the element in case the cycling switch goes bad and the thermal fuse protects the dryer if it stays to hot  Dishwasher Thermal power station Thermostat Fuse (electrical) Solar power Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Carburetor Steam engine Explosive material Pebble bed reactor Fire fighting Circuit breaker Gas turbine Incandescent light bulb Plastic Heat Stirling engine Residual-current device Furnace STS-61 Welding Aluminium Vacuum tube Fossil fuel power plant Fusion power Hot air balloon Turbofan Titanium Carbon Casting Diving suit Nuclear thermal rocket Nuclear reactor Electrical wiring Paragliding Space shuttle main engine Circuit design Tire Sulfur BS 1363 Apollo 13 Water (molecule) Items in the Metroid series Renewable energy Ocean thermal energy conversion Motor oil Gas tungsten arc welding Transistor Ohm's law Firearm Ceramics Seismic retrofit Air conditioning Ironing Hand grenade Combined cycle Electronic amplifier Engine cooling Dodge Neon STS-114 Computer cooling Dialysis Two-stroke cycle Carbon dioxide Washing machine Polyethylene terephthalate Entropy Stellar evolution E85 K__ppen climate classification Powder metallurgy Space disaster Inkjet printer Hard disk Spacecraft propulsion Monsoon Rocket fuel Bi-metal Internal combustion engine M60 machine gun Turbojet Resistor Lithium Beryllium Relay Electric motor Spark plug Glossary of firefighting equipment

the inside pane on my double paned window is shattered does anyone know how much it will cost the window is by the window itself is about twenty to thirty years old would it just be cheaper to replace both windows would it be easier if i did it myself or had someone do it for me real double paned windows have to be handled installed as an integrated set because the inner space is either evacuated or filled with an inert gas therefore the glass portion of your window both panes should be replaced assuming your widow design allows that otherwise you will probably have to call a professional at least to find out what has to be done rough estimate for that size double pane window glass would be installation would be a separate cost  Window Glass Solar power Vacuum tube Microsoft Windows John Hancock Tower Insulation Door Incandescent light bulb Mercury 4 Diamond simulant Linux USB flash drive RISC Windows Server 2003 Object Desktop CPU cache Virtual memory Nuclear power Hydrogen economy X86 Kitchen Pebble bed reactor Autonomous building Windows XP Common Unix Printing System Plastic Geiger-M__ller tube Redundant array of independent disks Modem Windows Vista Fire fighting Mouse (computing) Windows 3.x History of Microsoft Windows CPU design B-24 Liberator MDAC 64-bit Hash table Welding Parable of the broken window Italianate Stained glass IBM PC compatible Airbag File Allocation Table Scuba set IPod PHP De Lorean DMC-12 NTFS Automobile Visual Basic Windows Me Lighting Glossary of firefighting equipment Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center Printed circuit board Active Directory Chevrolet Corvair Macintosh Finder Normal distribution Floppy disk Digital Equipment Corporation Porsche 911 Commodore 64 Spring operating system Library (computer science) Vacuum Unicode NX bit Wayne Corporation Freedom Tower Passenger car Web page Microsoft Office Kernel (computer science) Partition (computing) Boeing 737 Nuclear fuel cycle History of the graphical user interface Bicycle frame QuickDraw Imperial (automobile) Address Book (software) Gas metal arc welding Drill bit Alcohol fuel M16 (rifle) Future energy development Petroleum Apple Macintosh X Window System Volleyball Car body style Architecture of Windows 2000 Apollo Command/Service Module Atari ST

outside a c condenser noisy my a c condenser unit outside is sometimes very noisy lately what might be the cause it's about years old and was cleaned about years ago how much can i expect to pay to replace the condenser the condenser fan motor bearings could be going bad or the hub on the fan blade is coming loose from the fan itself or the worst senerio is that the compressor could be going bad if the compressor is noisier at times than at others could mean that the compressor is going bad or the capacitor could be going bad causing it to work harder at times this is something you need an hvac tech to come and check and do a load test on your compressor and check your fan balde and fan motor  Jet engine Air conditioning Gas compressor Thermal power station Fan (implement) Electric motor Turbocharger HVAC Tire Motor oil Rolls-Royce Trent SR-71 Blackbird Dodge Neon Turbofan Pebble bed reactor Supersonic transport Gas turbine Refrigerator Paul W.

the refrigerator in the office isn't keeping things cold what could be the cause i had a bottle of powerade in the freezer since yesterday afternoon and went to get it today and it just feels like it's been in a refridgerator at it's coldest temp needless to say it wasn't frozen i showed it to my boss and she said that the handyman needs to vacuum the coils does this sound right if so what else could be the cause aren't the coils on the back of the fridge i went to look at them to see how dusty they were but i didn't see any coils have they changed the location of the coils there is a metal cover about inches wide and the length of the fridge vertically on the back could this be covering the coils doubtful about this any other suggestions are gladly appreciated you could be low on freon but probably your boss is right a good cleaning of the coils condenser motor etc in the back will probably do wonders oh yeah the coils are what the fan blows through the hot gas from the condenser passes through this and is cooled with the fan if this coil is blocked by dust air flow does not do it's job  Refrigerator Air conditioning Thermal power station Tesla coil Solar power Mattress Bong Phase change heat pump Thermostat Fossil fuel power plant Vacuum Haloalkane HVAC Carburetor Brewery Bass guitar Magnet Furnace Cryogenics Paul Is Dead Heat exchanger Hard disk Carbon dioxide Electric motor Fog Transformer Temperature Climate of the United Kingdom Vacuum tube Stove Relay Wire Episodes of Lost (Season 1) M16 (rifle) Cloud Stirling engine Welding Nine Inch Nails Spark plug Fluorescent lamp Fan (implement) Jet engine Autonomous building Water (molecule) Stone Cold Steve Austin Ice cream Steam engine Food preservation Ocean thermal energy conversion Charmed Hong Kong-style milk tea Soldering Movie projector Engine cooling Equine conformation Floppy disk Spacecraft propulsion Heat Gas tungsten arc welding Piccolo Junior Saga Circuit design Basement Hey Jude Cathode ray tube Helium Refrigeration Polyethylene terephthalate Coil (band) Glass Coffee Tea Naruto jutsu Dodge Neon Marilyn Monroe Heinkel He 100 Motor oil Gong Gas compressor Pebble bed reactor Knots Landing Severe weather terminology (United States) Solar variation Wind Refrigerant Computer cooling Ice core Seismometer STS-87 Blood on the Tracks Salad Fingers Railgun Superconductivity Diode Weather lore Precipitation (meteorology) Shakuhachi Gramophone record Upholstery Town gas

how to remove deck sealer from vinyl siding have waited way to long to ask this question but still need to get this done i applied deck sealer a couple of months ago using a garden sprayer as recommended but unfortunately came to discover that i got much of the spray along the siding of my house and have yet to find a good solution to remove the small specks of dark brown deck sealer without damaging my siding what suggestions do you have i would try a power washer with attached soap dispenser foam a good high quality detergent on the siding and rinse with high pressure you may have to use a scrub brush as you have left the stain on for a few months on another note next time you seal the deck wet the house down first before you begin spraying then it is easy to wash off right away  Car washing techniques Soap Upholstery Detergent Casting Mattress Dishwashing Manicure Washing machine Hand washing Car wash Sento Dry cleaning Shampoo Textile manufacturing Laundry detergent Japanese toilet Menstrual cup Wok Bulk vending Oscilloscope Spark plug Staining (biology) Fire extinguisher Hard water Vinegar Bong Motor oil Fire fighting Laundry Urinary incontinence Psoriasis Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Thermal power station Draw poker Flue gas desulfurization Hydrochloric acid Tire Glossary of nautical terms Seismic retrofit Sugar beet Plastic Brush History of Victoria Eczema Soap bubble Diseases of the honeybee Fluoride therapy Hygiene Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Tattoo Sperm Whale Poker jargon Canoe Glossary of firefighting equipment Pepper spray Lawn mower Sewage treatment Toilet paper Lionel Corporation Printed circuit board Arcade cabinet Water purification Irrigation Western blot Yu-Gi-Oh!

central air problem with new house i just moved into a new house to rent the power just got cut on yesterday yesterday evening i cut the central air on so that it would cool it down real nice as i was going to unpack some boxes i left and came back a couple hours later and it still wasnt that cool it was hot outside but the vents were not blowing out air as hard as i think they should have i called my landlord and hes suppose to help this evening but im just wandering what could be the prob depending on how your a c is wired your outdoor unit may be isolated electrically check to see if the outdoor unit isolating switch is in the off position and turn it on with the power completely isolated to the house there are no normal circumstances that should create this issue a c units are a sealed system and having them sitting idle without power supply doesn't make the freon leak or anything like that cars do have this problem though so it's hard to answer this one the only thing i can think of is if you have three phase power supply to the machine and one of the phases has lost it's supply anyway i'm only guessing out loud here you will have to see what the landlord can come up with i'm afraid good luck  Transformer Thermostat Vacuum tube Haloalkane Refrigerator Thermal power station Residual-current device Air conditioning Cray-1 Internal combustion engine Electric motor Overhead lines Diode Solar power Futurama (TV series - season 5) Pebble bed reactor Loudspeaker Casting Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Drill bit Ethernet The Inside Electricity meter Hydraulic machinery Heat Stirling engine Jet engine Poker jargon Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Welding C programming language IP (complexity) Labor theory of value Gas metal arc welding Hearing impairment Fossil fuel power plant 2003 North America blackout Circuit design GunBound Capacitor Electrical wiring (UK) Fuel injection Leasing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis B-47 Stratojet Heinkel He 100 Energy development Fuse (electrical) Mercury Atlas 6 Engine cooling Estoppel Battery (electricity) Extreme Programming Cheating in poker Singlish Oh My Goddess!

there is black 'stuff' on my deck that sort of follows the wood grain line could this be mold i have used the armor deck cleaner on it and it did not wash off it can be scrubbed off but it is on much but not all of my sq ft deck and the steps what can i do about this i am repainting the deck tomorrow so i have to have it all clean today so it will be dry tomorrow it was just painted years ago but i am wondering if the man who did it made sure it was completely dry he used a very expensive deck paint that was supposed to last years and the employee at sherwin williams said he'd never seen that paint fail before now yeah i hate setting those kinds of records first a question for you if the guy who did it said it would last for five years why isn't he refinishing the deck anyway mix up a c water c laundry bleach and tablespoons dish detergent scrub this solution into some of the black spots don't be stingy and let it sit for minutes then rinse if it's mold or mildew the stain will come off or at least really really lighten and here's the rest of the story from an answer i previously posted clean the deck thoroughly use a liquid laundry detergent it has non bleach additives that'll clean the wood better than just soap water solution of one cup laundry detergent to one gallon of warm water broom the solution onto the deck wood let sit for minutes and then rinse rinse rinse try to do the cleaning early in the day when the deck is in shade if there are any mold mildew stains treat them w a bleach water solution after cleaning the rest of the deck area per above instruction if this doesn't work use a tsp trisodium phosphate solution of one cup tsp one cup household bleach and one gallon water broom solution onto deck wait minutes then scrub rinse the solution off with a broom then let the wood dry i can't stress the rinsing drying too much applying anything over detergenty and or damp wood will reduce it's staying power by about oh say to refinish the deck decide if a wood stain or paint is preferred if the wood isn't terrific paint it use an exterior paint made for decks or a marine grade deck paint for safety's sake consider adding an anti slip agent to the paint paints will typically require at least two coats if the deck is made of good to great grained wood a penetrating stain is usually preferable you can choose a natural wood stain or a colored stain you can get away w one coat of stain but it'll last longer and look tons better if you use two coats no matter what you choose for the deck's finish it must have the following three characteristics else you're gonna be doing this job every year the stain paint has to be water repellent or water proof not just water resistant the stain paint has to have uv ultraviolet protection the paint stain should contain a mildewicide if it doesn't you can buy a mildewicide separately and add it to the stain paint if there's trees shrubbery overhanging the deck consider cutting it back to avoid water dripping onto the deck while also allowing sun to get to the deck do allllllllllllllll of this and the deck should be good to go for at least three years and upwards of five hope this helps tx griff  Upholstery Laundry detergent Textile manufacturing Casting Dry cleaning Paint Trisodium phosphate Car washing techniques Hydrogen peroxide Dishwasher Soap Vinegar Menstrual cup Water purification Staining (biology) Fire extinguisher Detergent Seismic retrofit Japanese tea ceremony Laundry Wok Plastic Washing machine Sento Sodium hypochlorite Psoriasis Dairy Manicure Hamster Mattress Poker jargon Soap bubble Dinghy Sulfuric acid Hard water Sewage treatment Sterilization (microbiology) Wood Bong Wood carving Western blot Coffee Motor oil Solar power Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hand washing Violin Diaper Shampoo Woodworking Bread Dialysis Lionel Corporation Air pollution Primer (paint) Volleyball Drill bit Cooking weights and measures Gypsy moth Wood pulp Carpet Strap-on dildo Kosher foods Carbon dioxide Microeconomics Electrophysiology Theory of conduct Extreme Programming Gram staining Body piercing Plating Agarose gel electrophoresis Cheese Sodium percarbonate Rice Pottery Gas metal arc welding Vanilla Wind turbine Contact lens Tooth enamel Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Explosive material Brush The Human Stain Disinfection Alcohol fuel Fire fighting Hemp Citric acid Diamond enhancement

need to remove carpet glue from cement patio the previous owners of our home put down outdoor carpeting that was just horrible color was hideous and the workmanship left much to be desired well we've gotten the carpet off but there is glue everywhere any idea on how to remove it thank you my husband said that you'll have to get a inch scraper and scrape it off also hosing it down and letting it sit a bit might aid in the glue loosening up but it will still need scraping he also said that there's no chemical that will just take it off sorry looks like this might be your only way  Vacuum cleaner Drill bit Tanning Concrete Textile manufacturing Tire Hand scraper Adhesive Knife Upholstery IPod Carpet Wire wrap Chair Hemp Cello Toilet humour Metalworking Leather Nail (anatomy) Comanche Dial M for Murder Roomba Hamster Great Pyramid of Giza Inhalant Wound Bong Olduwan Screw Glossary of wildland fire terms Bulldozer Electrophysiology Dog training Internal ballistics Economy of Nepal Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Cat Sheaf (mathematics) Bassoon Home repair Pittsburgh Steelers Tag Irrigation Pontiac Trans Sport Solvent Glossary of firefighting equipment Chevrolet Lumina APV Mezzotint Plastic Ultimate Spider-Man Card scraper Shoe Table tennis Radon Pasadena, California Scarification Peanut Diving suit Donald Neilson Snake charming Gilding Oasis (band) Jan van Goyen The Marriage of Figaro Stucco Animal Farm Domestic water system Magnesium Fresno Scraper Five-Year Plan Atari ST EastEnders Machining Woodworking Skinny Puppy Surrealist techniques Animal Crossing Spider Joseph Whitworth Violin Dialysis Ethyl acetate Pysanka Home improvement Clinker (boat building) The Brady Bunch Impressionism Aerial (dance move) Zinc Courtyard The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Grothendieck topology Dredge Weapon Wool CW complex Gypsy moth Multiple chemical sensitivity

copper pipe should i replace it with what i have copper piping in my year old home i've noticed blue areas along the horizontal surfaces where the pipe is corroding i haven't noticed any leaks yet i had a plumber out today doing another job he said he has seen this type of thing in our area i'm trying to determine if i should replace all my copper pipe put clamps on the spots that are pitting or what lastly if i do choose to replace the pipe how do i decide if i should go with copper again i don't want to be replacing the pipe again in another years but i don't know if the corrosion has been caused by defective pipe a bad installation job or something else here's the thing i'm no plumber i actually discovered these spots on the pipes years ago and assumed it was from condensation on the outside of the pipe causing the problem the plumber that was here said the corrosion started on the inside i don't know how he knows this he wants to replace all of the piping how do i determine if this is problem caused by leakage from the inside or this is just corrosion on the outside if it is coming from the inside would you replace with copper perhaps it's a problem with the water you may not need to replace anything or maybe worst case a few sections all copper pipes will eventually get that bluish corrosion in any spot that leaks or at one time had a leak just because you have these doesn't mean it needs replacing often if there is a joint with a small leak the corrosion itself will seal it and you won't have any more problems until you move the pipes around in that area if you are going to replace i like copper because it's easier to install in my opinion and experience then pvc however pvc is cheaper and does last a long time there is nothing wrong with it copper should last over years  Corrosion Thermal power station Welding Plastic Seismic retrofit Soldering Spark plug Hydrogen economy Bong Carburetor Electrical wiring Furnace Hard water Stainless steel M16 (rifle) Dairy Shipwreck Pump Aluminium Novelty (locomotive) Cruising (maritime) Electrophysiology Kitchen Wind turbine Action potential Coaxial cable Ammonia Urinary incontinence Farthing (coin) Elevator Laserdisc Solar power Containment building Hydrochloric acid Brazing E85 Nuclear power Copper Motor oil Nuclear weapon design Chess strategy and tactics Fire extinguisher Irrigation Cray-1 Renewable energy Fossil fuel power plant Copper extraction 2000 Australian Grand Prix Screw Transformer Hydraulic machinery Blue Man Group Eifel Aqueduct Reading spark plugs for racing Equine conformation Printed circuit board Ethernet Rocket fuel Solder William Murdoch Water supply Cookware and bakeware Faster-than-light Rust Diving suit Internal ballistics Flush toilet Geodesic dome Loudspeaker Borehole Cathodic protection Galvanic cell Wario Terminal ballistics Sleeve valve Roof Thermostat Butte, Montana Stage lighting Metallurgy Sulfuric acid Electric motor Glass Prisoner's dilemma Reinforced concrete Theory of conduct Vacuum 24 Hours of Le Mans Light switch 1957 World Series Capacitor plague Light-emitting diode Teller-Ulam design Apollo 13 STS-61 Rifle Anchor Plame affair

whats ballpark figure for siding replacement i have an year old colonial single car garage there are several options in vinyl siding you can get double double panels they are generally ' long and it takes about pieces to cover a square with double you also need outside corners and j channel for gables and around windows doors etc if you have a menard's near you the building materials desk will help you figure the amount needed therefore the cost it also depends on what is on the exterior now you may have to put up support firring siding needs a fairly stable surface in order to prevent waviness when it expands and contracts with the weather i suggest going to a home center like menard's or home depot and asking the building materials department to help you with the estimate siding is not rocket science however there are key elements to doing it right such as making sure your starter strip is perfectly level from then on its a hooking on and nailing process with some cutting as you reach a gable or window door opening  Gramophone record Window Door Roof Seismic retrofit Welding Drill bit Floppy disk Geodesic dome Dodge Charger Solar cell Architecture of the California missions Vinyl roof Mattress Fire fighting Chatsworth House Windows Vista Slide rule Space Shuttle program Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Colonization of the Moon Wrigley Field McMansion Ford Thunderbird Port Authority Trans-Hudson Station wagon Glossary of firefighting equipment Solar power Oscilloscope Car body style Xanadu House San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Tire Baseball Great Pyramid of Giza Space elevator Blackjack Wood carving Dairy Climate change Timber framing Imperial (automobile) Sun Passenger car Woodworking Elevator Solar power satellite Moon Internal ballistics Nuclear power West Side Highway Transistor Air traffic control Anchor Volkswagen Type 2 Bus models used in New York City Transit Pontiac Trans Sport Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Glossary of American football Transformer Casting Lighting Dundas Square United States Postal Service Defense Logistics Agency Rathfarnham Redundant array of independent disks Radio controlled airplane Windows XP Textile manufacturing Kasparov versus The World De Lorean DMC-12 Petroleum Crew Exploration Vehicle Computer chess Tai shogi Ford Cortina Combine (Half-Life 2) Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Global warming Panama Canal Docklands Light Railway Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Mouse (computing) Drag racing Glossary of firefighting terms Rail tracks The Shining (film) Movie projector Windows 2000 Light-frame construction Chess terminology PostScript Dash Taikyoku shogi Glass Table tennis Virtual memory EMD F7

how does a in house water pressure tank work i have a water pressure tank in my house it has like an air valve on it does it have a bladder in the tank i have low pressure in the house and am wondering if i could inflate the bladder would this increase my water pressure get a good water pressure meter and screw it onto an outlet in the house don't trust the old corroded one that's probably built into the plumbing i have a hand held one that is very good now run the water out of some other outlet like a hose bib the water pressure should start somewhere between and psi when the pressure drops to psi the well pump switch should kick on and start to fill up your bladder it will run for a few minutes and you can watch the pressure increase it should shut off when it reaches psi psi is standard for well systems if you really have low pressure you will be able to measure it this way the problem will be your well pump switch however if the pressure is ok then what you may have is a corroded pipe that is pinching off the water flow somewhere there are two measurements for water pressure and volume the corroded pipe will reduce the flow volume but does not affect the pressure regarding the air pressure in the bladder tank this needs to be set at about psi below the cut on water pressure so for a standard system the air pressure should be psi you can check this with a good tire pump if you set it higher than then all of the water will leave the bladder tank before the pump turns on giving you a momentary loss of water alternatively if you set the air pressure too low then the tank will be allowed to fill up too much and overstretch the bladder but it has no effect on the water pressure  Hydraulic machinery Diving regulator Siphon Glossary of firefighting equipment Thermal power station Diving cylinder Gas compressor Flush toilet Irrigation E85 Rebreather Fire fighting Vacuum Pump Scuba set Brewery Water supply Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Glossary of wildland fire terms Blood pressure Dialysis Bong Electrophysiology Carbon dioxide Solar power Apollo Command/Service Module Hydrogen economy Glossary of firefighting terms Two-stroke cycle Thermostat Turbocharger Three Mile Island Jet engine Circuit breaker Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Energy development Oxyacetylene Saturn V Newcomen steam engine Toyota Prius Heat Space Shuttle external tank Diesel engine Fuel injection Wave power Coriolis effect Loudspeaker Steam engine Motorcycle Transformer Prostate cancer Water hammer Diving Fluid pressure Aircraft engine controls Novelty (locomotive) Fuel pump Portable stove Propeller Turbojet Tire Space shuttle main engine Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Equine conformation Gas turbine Rail terminology 2003 North America blackout Fossil fuel power plant Snorkel Hypertension Sewage treatment Fire hydrant Air brake (rail) Tide Cruising (maritime) Panama Canal Tap (valve) USS Yorktown (CV-5) Domestic water system Internal combustion engine Decompression sickness Lung Rocket fuel Corrosion Stirling engine Helium Drowning Lift (force) Dam PID controller

my toilet cistern is leaking water from the overflow i have no knowledge of plumbing any ideas the ball valve is not closing off properly this may be due to the washer in the valve being worn quick fix lift the lid off the cistern and you will see a long arm with a plastic ball on the end if you bend the arm down slightly this should solve the problem in the short term this really is a short term repair and you need to consider replacing the ball valve with a new one you can replace the washer but with a new ball valve costing in the region of p is it worth it a plumber should do the job in less than an hour and would probably charge you about p plus the cost of the ball valve consider replacing the ball valve with a modern inlet valve such as a torbeck valve a little more expensive at about p but a lot more efficient and quieter in operation fitting costs should be the same  Flush toilet Carburetor Hydraulic machinery Vacuum tube Plumbing fixture Urinal Autonomous building Spark plug Two-stroke cycle Computer Domestic water system Cruising (maritime) Seismic retrofit Trombone Home repair Fuel injection Tire Sleeve valve Turbocharger Toilet Poppet valve Four-stroke cycle Sewage treatment Equine conformation Diving regulator Thermal power station Dialysis Motorcycle Three Mile Island Thermostat Rebreather Glossary of firefighting equipment Automatic transmission PID controller Newcomen steam engine Dodge Neon Pushrod engine Glossary of American football Douglas DC-8 Diving suit Electronic amplifier Rail terminology Camshaft High-voltage direct current Internal ballistics Heart valve Volleyball Bullet Variable valve timing Team Fortress Classic Bicycle William Murdoch Clinker (boat building) Tank Steam engine Baseball VTEC Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Menstrual cup Fast bowling Chevrolet Corvair engine Timing belt Oxyacetylene Basement Drill bit Nuclear power Hydraulic ram Internal combustion engine Cistern Microeconomics Tidal power Novelty (locomotive) General relativity M16 (rifle) Diver rescue Mortgage Strap-on dildo E85 2000 Australian Grand Prix Circuit breaker Canoe Buoyancy compensator Plastic Air gun Jet engine Gasoline Hydrogen economy Elevator STS-61 Steam (content delivery) Golf club (equipment) Mouse (computing) Honda Prelude M60 machine gun Bagpipes Urinary incontinence

how can i remove candle wax already absorbed into drywall so i can paint nicely candle wax was spilled take a putty knife and remove all trace of the spilled wax if this means gouging out a bit of the paper that lines the drywall then so be it the important thing is to remove all trace of the wax because paint will not adhere to it give that area a light buff with sanding paper to remove any bits that stick out then take some drywalling compound these can be bought in small container if you are only doing a small job and fill the holes you left behind when removing the wax use a wide bladed putty knife to do the last bit of smoothing so that what remains is flush with the rest of the wall allow to dry thoroughly there are instructions on how long to wait on the container then do another light sanding to remove any unnecessary bits you will need to prepare that virgin surface you have created with a primer that is if you want this area to look just like the rest of the wall when you are done people who redecorate a lot have small cans of primer on hand at all times in order to cover repairs when this has dried just paint as normal  Casting Woodworking Drill bit Knife Wallpaper Pysanka Gilding Menstrual cup Seismic retrofit Top-bar hive Paint Toilet paper Plaster Drawing Textile manufacturing Brewery Manicure Thermal power station Ski wax Upholstery Hand grenade Cross-country skiing Dairy Tire Sulfuric acid Sand casting Glass Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Handloading Wood carving Poker jargon Screw Spider Pottery Gramophone record Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Motor oil Coffee Surrealist techniques Bassoon Radio controlled airplane Fan (implement) Cartridge (firearms) Plastic Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Silly Putty Printmaking Wood Masonry Leather Earwax Alkane Phonograph cylinder Genericized trademark Printed circuit board Mnemonic Evidence of evolution Linear Pottery culture Firearm Vermicompost Punch card Hamster Candle Carnivorous plant Tobacco Tofu Comanche Great Pyramid of Giza Spidey Super Stories Phase (matter) Solvent Laser engraving Register renaming Sushi Petroleum Painting Champagne (beverage) CDC 6600 Steganography Wax play 2000 Australian Grand Prix Cosmetics Bong Stucco Burroughs B5000 Items in the Metroid series Japanese toilet Axe Social rule Devil Fruit Equine conformation Car washing techniques Ammonia

a question about my central air unit and freon ive been having a problem with my c a unit ive changed the filter cleaned the coils and everything to the point that the only thing that it might be needing is freon to put in so we called a heating and air speicalists and he said he would charge us no higher then to put freon in it thats labor and all he says it depends on how low it is it could cost us lower then that he said freon is a pound my qeustion is is that a good deal we are new to this and i just want to be careful about who i get to do this also when the c a tech goes to check out everything to make sure that the central air is working correctly what all rooms do they check do they stay mostly in the basement and around the outside unit the reason why i'm asking because i have small children and our house is a large story so i dont want the c a tech to come into a room and fall over a toy or anything lol hello karma if this price includes the service call it is a bargain if it is just for the refrigerant and installation it is still a good price but be sure to ask what the trip cost is pound for r is a fair market price this includes the training tools and regulations the hvac tech has to have in order to install the stuff the tech will need to have access to your indoor unit the thermostat the return grille grill that collects the air returning to your indoor unit and a supply grill air coming out of the indoor unit if you can have the children stay out of the way it will be appreciated the little ones are curious but he will be moving quickly and be focused on getting the job done quickly and correctly the first time if you can have the kids visit a sitter that would be best otherwise ask them to stay out of the way keep kool  HVAC Air conditioning Thermostat Inflation Haloalkane Refrigerator Thermal power station Cray-1 Microeconomics Autonomous building Scientology beliefs and practices Heat Economics Deflation (economics) Welding Ives Manufacturing Company Solar power Transformer Mutual fund Labor theory of value Airline Illegal drug trade Swimming pool E85 Carburetor Burglar alarm Economic calculation problem Arbitrage Kitchen Modem Loudspeaker Economy of the United States Labour economics Hard disk Hydrogen economy Euro Externality CPU design Monetary policy Free trade Minimum wage Tariff Phase change heat pump Dialysis Ford Motor Company Light-emitting diode Supply-side economics Commodore 64 Incandescent light bulb Turbocharger Keynesian economics Health insurance Efficiency wages Mainframe computer Equine conformation Technology Volleyball Daylight saving time Domestic rabbit Capitalism Floppy disk Natural monopoly Biodiesel Wind turbine Mach kernel Motor oil Coin collecting Mac OS X Sailing Gold standard Nuclear power Economic rent Value added tax Offshoring Terran (StarCraft) Solar cell Internal ballistics Handloading Glossary of firefighting terms CPU cache Laserdisc Web crawler Hamster In-N-Out Burger Airsoft Japanese toilet Air pollution Basement Paragliding Furnace Law of value Electrical wiring Economy of India Bank

what is best way to remove deck stain from vinyl siding one of my workers accidentally got a dark red stain on a customers vinyl siding it's a foot by foot area i tried to powerwash it and even used a stain stripper and all it seemed to do was make it dull i also used an sos pad and a bristle brush but they wouldn't get into the grooves is there any other sort of fix i can do that would remedy this problem some sort of white vinyl paint or something really good at getting out stain you have two options here first option would be to replace the siding a x area would be one square you will probably need a bit more due to the way the panels are staggered sounds like the siding is white for materials depending upon the brand and grade of siding if you are capable of doing the work yourself this may be your best option to make the customer happy second option is a mild abrasive cleaner such as soft scrub it will work into the texture of the siding better than just a scrubber pad this will change the sheen of the surface slightly but no more than you have already done if you used an sos pad this is certainly the easiest and least expensive solution if your customer is agreeable do not use solvents mineral spirits wd stain remover and the like on vinyl siding it will create a new mess depending upon the brand of siding it may penetrate a bit and leave a discoloration that you can't remove you will be stuck with replacing the siding at that point  Gramophone record Drill bit Mattress Woodworking Tooth enamel Soldering Plastic Knife Dry cleaning Window Disc brake Paint Beatmania IIDX De Lorean DMC-12 Strap-on dildo Paint stripper Pottery Drawing Typewriter Seismic retrofit Brush Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Dance Dance Revolution Pump It Up Arcade cabinet Casting DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Laserdisc Wood Phonograph Opportunity rover Mouse (computing) Spirit rover timeline for 2005 March Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Bong Vinyl roof Airsoft Cross-country skiing Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Mining Table saw DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Volleyball Chair In The Groove (game) Laundry detergent Extreme Programming DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Printed circuit board DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Tobacco Violin Wood carving Light-emitting diode Trademark Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Lionel Corporation Billboard (advertising) Tofu Tattoo PlayStation 2 Flue gas desulfurization Sound recording Turquoise Eraser Staining (biology) Glossary of climbing terms Floppy disk Super Nintendo Entertainment System Rebreather Leather Billiards Home repair Nuclear power Ammonia Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Psoriasis Internal ballistics Contact lens Sulfuric acid Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Glass Trail Shroud of Turin Polyvinyl chloride Snooker Friction Vacuum cleaner Acetic acid Asbestos CPU design Lighting Diving suit Wassily Kandinsky Theory of conduct Hydrogen peroxide Unusual types of gramophone record

how long does it take to paint a house or perhaps my question is am i being jerked around i hired a painting company and the crew manager said they would come out and powerwash on a friday and then start to paint on a monday jul no one showed up so he said wed then thurs then fri finally after complaining someone comes out to powerwash on jul painters come monday and work thru thurs the painters on his crew quit and it's now aug and my house is partially painted of course he says they are coming out tomorrow or the next day is this a typical housepainting experience i've never had a house painted before so i have no idea the contract only indicates the job to be completed in the summer but i find the drawing out the dates like that to be not very professional it's a national company by the way that hires college kids i'm a painting contractor and no this is not normal business practices most good contractors show up when they say they will weather permitting the weather can push the start time back also the weather can affect the start date after the pressure washing you normally need at least business days to let things thoroughly dry if your contract does not have a specific start and finish date then you might be at their will no matter how much you approve or disapprove of their business tactics if you haven't paid in full you could try to negoiate with them to finish quickly or drop them and hire somone else to finish the work did you get references  Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina ITV Outsourcing New York Giants Efficiency wages Norway national football team Academic art Article One of the United States Constitution National Health Service Unemployment Oakland Athletics Calculating the day of the week Crew Exploration Vehicle Keynesian economics National Football League Wal-Mart Extreme Programming Carl Barks Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Ontological argument North Staffordshire Railway Michael D.

flickering security light there is a security light on my house with a photo cell that comes on for seconds then goes off day and night any ideas would be helpful it could be things replace the light itself replace the photo cell light control or adjust any variable switches here's info from the smarthome site do you find that you forget to turn on certain lights at dusk or to turn them off during the day timers can be helpful in scheduling lights to turn on and off at regular times but they can be difficult to install and program for easy installation and control the dusk to dawn photocell light control screws into a lamp base and its built in photocell will automatically turn the attached light on at dusk and off at dawn no additional wiring is required the dusk to dawn photocell light control is for use with candelabra base bulbs sold separately by screwing this sensor into your light socket and then screwing your light bulb directly into this sensor your light will only turn on in the dark use the sensitivity ring to control how sensitive you want the sensor to be if you feel your light is turning on at a time that you don't need it you can adjust the sensitivity ring so that the sensor is less sensitive to the light coming in and wont turn on as easy if you want your light turning on regardless of the light coming in you can completely cover the sensor to ensure that your light stays on at all times should not be used with cfl compact fluorescent lights  Incandescent light bulb Compact fluorescent lamp Fluorescent lamp Traffic light Lighting Street light X10 (industry standard) Oxygen sensor Carburetor Headlight Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Seismometer Digital photography Light-emitting diode Sensor Canon T90 Thermostat Burglar alarm Light pollution Rotor machine Eye Mouse (computing) Oscilloscope Solar cell Vacuum tube Manual transmission Japanese toilet Surveillance Semiconductor device Electric motor Security lighting Windows XP Dimmer Automotive lighting BS 1363 Screw Color Photography Propeller Cannabis cultivation Programmable logic controller Saturn V STS-114 Hubble Space Telescope Transducer Radiation hardening Relay Fuse (electrical) Bluetooth STS-62 Strap-on dildo Washroom Movie projector Ethernet Drill bit Switch Leica Mercedes-Benz A-Class Light switch Wrench Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Color temperature Railway signal Naval mine Aurora (astronomy) Enigma machine INSTEON Musical Instrument Digital Interface Lightsaber Television Elevator Danger Hiptop TGV Atomic clock Mercury-vapor lamp Apollo Guidance Computer Radar Houseplant Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Magnetic core memory Visual Basic Microscopy Macro photography Solar power Ultraviolet Apollo Command/Service Module Embedded system Mattress Electrical wiring Inertial guidance system Photoresistor Sail-plan USS Tunny (SS-282) Items in the Metroid series

cfc bulbs flicker when celing fan is off i replaced all of my bulbs in my home with cfc bulbs aside from the misrepresentation on the packaging supposed to give off the equivalant of a w bulb yet the rooms are much darker now the bulbs i installed in the celing fan fixture in my living room flicker when the celing fan is not on the bulbs are in tight i double checked when i noticed this flickering the fan is made by hunter and has a remote control to control fan speed and to turn on off the light it does not have a dimmer function it is also on a way switch the flickering never occured with standard bulbs and never occurs when the fan is on high regardless what direction the fan spins in nyphonejacks yahoo com light also flickers when fan is in low speed cfls do not play well with any kind of electronically controlled socket fixtures with photo sensors or timers do not work well either the electronics that take care of the switching mess with the frequency of the electricity supplied to the socket the effect is reduced as the load on the device increases when your fan is on high it is pulling enough current to bring the frequency back in working range for the cfl normal bulbs are not sensitive to the frequency to a point but florescents are most cfls indicate on the label that they are not suitable for an electronically switched fixture  Compact fluorescent lamp Fluorescent lamp Light-emitting diode Incandescent light bulb Electric motor Headlight Alternating current X10 (industry standard) Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Dimmer Transistor Lighting Stage lighting Vacuum tube Transformer Fuse (electrical) High-voltage direct current Mouse (computing) Haloalkane Relay Solar cell Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Light switch Radiation hardening Oscilloscope Traffic light Bicycle lighting Loudspeaker Universal Serial Bus Switch Super Nintendo Entertainment System Electronic amplifier Wind power Gramophone record STS-62 Carburetor Digital photography Antenna (radio) Ozone depletion Light pollution Jack plug Electrical wiring (UK) Universal Century Technology Embedded system Airbus A380 Bass guitar Electrical generator Semiconductor device Floppy disk Wind turbine Seismometer Ozone hole BS 1363 Programmable logic controller Oxygen sensor Digital circuit Modem Decibel Electricity meter Hall effect Bluetooth Apollo Guidance Computer Circuit breaker Rotor machine Residual-current device Thermal power station Spark gap Central processing unit Electrodeless lamp Washroom Computer Circuit design Welding USB flash drive Nuclear magnetic resonance Analog-to-digital converter Street light Phase-locked loop Switched-mode power supply MOSFET Acorn Electron Fuel injection Elevator Jet engine Torpedo Equine conformation Explosive material

blinking exterior home lighting is driving me crazy i have three light on my rear garage that blink like they are on some sort of timer they go on for about sec and then off for never varies there is apparently no switch for these lights either i'm going to install a switch but i would first like to know what is causing them to flash i have access to the rear of the lights but don't see anything that might be the cause i've changed out the bulbs from what i can see by tracing the wires in the attic there is nothing there either they are coach lights i've looked at them pretty close and i do not believe they are triggered by motion or dusk dawn but since there seems not to be a switch that would make sense i have put in standard incandesent w and w compact flouesents bulbs and they both turn off and on the same way the garage has its own breaker box and they still do this even with everything turned off they three light turn off and on together thanks for all your suggestions great i found the sensor it was located near an eave on the back of the garage and i can hear it cycling adjusting it didn't do anything but i'm going to swap in a new one and see if that does the trick if these are automatic lights that come on at dusk i would suggest that the cause might be the light sensor that turns the lights on is malfunctioning or the lamp light is providing feedback to the light sensor and turning the lamps off and then the cycle repeats the thing that suggests that is the constant second interval you noted that is the darkness turns the lamp on the sensor sees the light from the lamp and turns it off the darkness turns the lamp on etc with a second response time with all the lights cycling at the same time it sounds like one sensor controls all so you should probably try to locate the sensor in the system and see if maybe it has been moved away from it's proper position  Traffic light Automotive lighting Headlight Mouse (computing) Street light Fluorescent lamp Stage lighting X10 (industry standard) Bicycle lighting Switch Lighting Incandescent light bulb Eye Sensor Electric motor Embedded system Floppy disk Transformer Apollo Guidance Computer Railway signal Seismometer Airbag Relay M16 (rifle) Cannabis cultivation Musical Instrument Digital Interface Movie projector Enigma machine Burglar alarm Oscilloscope Hall effect Circuit breaker Amstrad CPC Elevator Bubble Bobble Daylight saving time Helicopter Inertial guidance system Nintendo Revolution Dimmer Thermostat Rotor machine Digital camera Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Residual-current device Electrophysiology Mercury Atlas 6 Carburetor Alternating current Magnetic core memory Armored Core Super Nintendo Entertainment System Light gun Digital Light switch Light pollution General relativity Keyboard technology Light-emitting diode Special relativity Altair 8800 Color Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Ignition system Federal Standard 1037C Combine (Half-Life 2) Brain Transducer System/34 Manual transmission Compact fluorescent lamp Oxygen sensor Film Electrical wiring Security lighting Cloaking device Motion capture Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk Shaggy dog story TGV Star Destroyer Phoebe Halliwell Digital photography Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Windows 2000 Light Wire wrap Steering Drag racing

i have an ariens lawn tractor it is of the emperor models it is pull start but wont start what do i do i changed the spark plug changed the oil cleaned the carb bowl what do i do next please help i have a lawn mowing job i'm and mow a few lawns and just got this tractor but it wont run keep in mind i only have about remove the spark plug reattach the plug wire to it then lay it down on the head or somewhere where the metal part touches the head or elsewhere on the engine and pull the starter cord you should see a spark at the tip of the plug if you don't then the ignition system may need repair if there's spark then try dumping a small amount of gasoline teaspoon into the carburetor throat and then pull the starter cord a few times if it fires up for a second and then dies there's no gasoline getting into the combustion chamber from the carb beyond that all that an engine needs to run is air and compression which i presume it has tho' you didn't say if you've ever seen the engine run and if not all bets are off if you don't have a compression tester a quick and very crude test for compression is to pull the starter cord slowly the engine should have enough compression to pretty much stop the rotation if not then there may be a stuck valve or some other problem head gasket cracked piston etc last if the gasoline in the tank is extremely old old gasoline is notorious for causing hard starting it sours by way of an oxidation process and loss of some volatile components try some fresh gasoline  Internal combustion engine Spark plug Two-stroke cycle E85 Motor oil Gasoline Four-stroke cycle Lawn mower Jet engine Reading spark plugs for racing Automobile Bong Toyota Prius Steam engine Compression ratio Thermal power station Turbocharger Automobile emissions control Chevrolet Corvair engine Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Gas turbine Internal ballistics Ford FE engine Alcohol fuel Diesel cycle Ford Windsor engine Ignition system Manifold vacuum Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Space shuttle main engine Engine tuning Radio controlled airplane Gnome Monosoupape Hydrogen economy Turbojet Carbon dioxide Aircraft engine Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Hydrogen vehicle Battery electric vehicle Reciprocating engine Biodiesel Tractor Convair B-36 Model aircraft Dodge Charger Gasoline direct injection Wankel engine Energy development M16 (rifle) Glossary of firefighting terms AMC V8 engine Fordson tractor Torpedo 24 Hours of Le Mans Cylinder head Top Fuel Town gas Alkane Sleeve valve Welding Automobile ancillary power Hybrid vehicle Toyota S engine Hybrid Synergy Drive Oldsmobile V8 engine Tobacco Glow plug Engine Petroleum Stratified charge engine Drill bit Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Air gun Dodge Neon Timeline of invention Fire fighting Tire Furnace Oxyacetylene Gas compressor Pulse jet engine Knife Tesla coil

i bought and hooked up a cheap digital thermostat ac worked before hand didn't work after rehooked up old still don't work what the world is wrong did you shut off the power to the system before hooking up the thermostat if you did not you may have short circuited the wires and burned up the transformer it takes th of a second to melt a transformer to test access the wires from the back of the thermostat the red wire is the power jump it to the green wire if your indoor fan comes on your transformer is still good if the fan does not come on you have a dead transformer if you are fortunate it may be a fuse that has opened up rather than the transformer if the fan functions jump red to yellow this is the cooling the system may have a short delay up to minutes if after seven minutes the cooling does not come on you have a problem that will need to be corrected by a reputable service company if the system does work your problem is with the 'stat or how you hooked it up if it was made in china the stat may be dead in the box not that uncommon take it back to retailer and get a replacement keep kool  Thermostat Fuse (electrical) Apollo 13 Solar power Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Transformer Circuit breaker Telephone exchange Embedded system Residual-current device Central processing unit Cable television DVD HVAC STS-61 Universal Serial Bus Voice over IP Oscilloscope BS 1363 Armored Core Cray-1 Lineman (occupation) Computer Three-phase electric power Ice hockey Light-emitting diode Joy Division (band) Thermal power station Relay Digital circuit Circuit design Field-programmable gate array Telephone IBM PC compatible Transformers: Armada Phreaking Power line communication Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis International League Link (Legend of Zelda) Printed circuit board Electrical wiring (UK) Action potential Welding Futurama (TV series - season 5) Gas metal arc welding Carburetor Unicode Thermocouple Bubble Bobble Dog agility DualDisc Three Mile Island Cleveland Browns MapleStory Hand grenade MOSFET Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Ceramics Incandescent light bulb Calculator Overclocking Vacuum tube Walt Disney World Railroad Mario Poker jargon Pebble bed reactor Apollo 1 Apollo Guidance Computer Electrophysiology Electronics Compiler optimization System/34 Sonic the Hedgehog Electric motor Professional wrestling throws Earthing system Peter Gabriel Wi-Fi Overhead lines Items in the Metroid series Solar cell Donkey Kong 64 Railway signalling TGV Electrical wiring Control system Loudspeaker RS-232 Oakland Athletics Switch Mattress Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Atari 8-bit family Megas XLR Transistor SCART ITunes Music Store Aircraft carrier Public-key cryptography

carpet cleaner chemically lightened carpet i have a tan white colored carpet its a normal carpet the threads are about inches long one time i used a carpet cleaner and didnt read the directions and sprayed the carpet and left it to soak there for a few minutes now the carpet spot is yellow any way to fix the unfixable other than getting a new carpet i personally prefer woolite spotshot for those little carpet mishaps but not sure if that would fix your problem i have seen martha stewart use oxiclean to whiten and remove stains from antique table linens when doing so she allows the item to soak in the oxiclean for as long as hours i don't think oxiclean would harm your carpet and at this stage how much harm could it do i would apply it liberally and reapply from time to time to keep it damp until the stain disappears up to several hours or even a day if no cleaner works is covering the stain with a rug or piece of furniture an option there might be some way to cut out the stained area and replace with a remnant of unstained carpet if necessary taking the unstained piece from a closet floor or from under a large piece of furniture but i don't know how you would secure the patch down maybe your carpet supplier could suggest a method or be willing to do it for you hope something in that helps you somehow  Carpet Upholstery Vacuum cleaner Roomba Drill bit Woodworking Tooth enamel Chair Stairway Fire fighting Mattress Plastic Patch (computing) Textile manufacturing terminology Hydrogen peroxide Shroud of Turin Staining (biology) Bedbug Bloodstain pattern analysis Diamond enhancement Pottery Animal Crossing Gramophone record Hamster Hemp Jute Casting The Adventure of the Second Stain Leather Basement Tag Bong Color Clothing GunZ The Duel Mario series enemies Microscopy Bulk vending Gypsy moth Japanese tea ceremony Screw Paint Glass Wood carving Fancy rat Diseases of the honeybee The Human Stain Photography Tattoo Peanut Urinary incontinence Niddah Persian rug Home repair Drawing Manicure Stage lighting Cannabis cultivation Lighting Shoe Gram staining Billiards Laundry detergent Wood Symmetry Oasis (band) Psoriasis Lathe Fuel injection White noise Surveillance Knife Table saw Common bean Ultraviolet Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Medical prescription Sterilization (microbiology) Fluorescent lamp Berkshire Hathaway Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Malignant melanoma Electrostatic precipitator English plural Drug test Eight ball House dust mite Poker jargon Strap-on dildo Agarose gel electrophoresis Cocaine Dai dai shogi Advertising Space Shuttle program Single Transferable Vote Airport Tai shogi Weed control Seismic retrofit

do closed interior doors bedroom affect the performance of central a c if the bedroom door are closed the majority of the time will that affect the performance efficiency of the central heating and a c system i have heard that it does but my kids want to keep their doors closed during the day when no one is home to keep the dogs out just curious if this affects the a c system or not according to the our utility provider it makes the central air conditioner work harder the air is supposed to circulate not just work in one room the fan circulating the air will even out the household temperature depending on where the thermostat is located closing doors could either cause your ac to shut off too soon thinking it has reached the desired temperature or continue working because it thinks it has not in my case the thermostat is on the first floor and cold air sinks so closing the doors upstairs makes those rooms hot and the ac thinks it has reached the temp i programmed according to their website it uses more energy to keep the doors closed  HVAC Thermostat Solar power Furnace Air conditioning Temperature Heat Deep lake water cooling Fire fighting Thermal power station The Brady Bunch Thermoregulation Aquarium Ocean thermal energy conversion Carburetor Apollo 13 Spark plug Climate of the United Kingdom Turbocharger Autonomous building Process control Jet engine Axial compressor Explosive material Motor oil McMansion Renewable energy Climate change Nuclear fusion Urban heat island Entropy Pebble bed reactor The Star Wars Holiday Special Transformer Atmospheric circulation Sun Central heating Burglar alarm Phase change heat pump Electrical wiring Vacuum Fossil fuel power plant Stirling engine SR-71 Blackbird Energy development Negative feedback Convection Radiator Kitchen Steam engine Fuel injection Heat engine Thermodynamics Brewery Hard disk Welding The Marriage of Figaro Diving suit Lighting Glossary of firefighting terms Internal combustion engine Rose (Doctor Who) Three Mile Island Toyota Prius Loudspeaker Thermocouple Xanadu House Sento TARDIS Door Ironing Hot air balloon Hydropower Passenger car El Ni__o Billy the Kid Sea ice Spacecraft propulsion Global climate model Heat equation Geothermal exchange heat pump Common cold Peltier-Seebeck effect Turbojet The Shining (film) Engine cooling Refrigerator Home improvement Frame problem 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Diesel engine Heat pump Fuel cell Control system Wilton House CPU cooling Fan death The Doctor Dances Zoning

can burning natural gas create a cooling effect i have turned off the pilot light to my central air unit in my home i reason since the weather is so hot i'd try to ave some money without running that pilot light i know it is not much but still it is ome today after turning off the heating source i feel that the central air unit is using more effort to cool down the house is this true or is my central air unit showing a case of co dependency on the gas today it is almost degrees o what you are experiencing is completely coincidental the very best cadillac of all heating and cooling systems can only provide about a twenty degree split between outdoor temperature so when you say that it has topped today your system and every system in your area is struggling to maintain temperature by turning off the pilot yes you know the fuel savings is minimal at best but in no way is it affecting the cooling in your home in most homes the furnace is located in a basement or garage maybe the attic these unconditioned areas are not being affected by the ac system so the amount of heat that the pilot emits is not being pulled back into the system for more information you can go to http www howellsac com and get routine tips on how to save money increase efficiency and reduce headaches good luck  Furnace Spark plug Temperature Solar power Thermostat Energy development Jet engine Explosive material Spacecraft propulsion Thermal power station Turbocharger Motor oil Autonomous building Hot air balloon Fire fighting Fossil fuel power plant HVAC Heat Diesel engine Air conditioning Hydrogen economy Vacuum tube Pebble bed reactor E85 Gas metal arc welding Wind power Internal combustion engine Renewable energy Nuclear weapon design Natural gas Wood fuel Stirling engine Space shuttle main engine Fire Transformer Turbojet Nuclear power Ozone depletion Axial compressor STS-62 Carbon dioxide Urban heat island Climate change Nuclear reactor Bong Incandescent light bulb Global warming Nuclear meltdown Portable stove Environmental concerns with electricity generation Nuclear fusion Power station Fuel injection Ozone hole Ocean thermal energy conversion Town gas Vacuum Severe weather terminology (United States) Future energy development Spectroscopy Laser Engine cooling Thermoregulation Water (molecule) Fluorescent lamp Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Gas turbine Steam engine Four-stroke cycle Basement Iron Steel Casting Climate of the United Kingdom Torpedo Hybrid vehicle Glossary of firefighting equipment Turbofan Glossary of firefighting terms Tank Stove Fuel cell Passive solar Stellar evolution Refrigerator Radon Combustion Helium

immersions heaters and central heating my friends landlord has told her that her central heating runs off an immersion heater i've never heard of this is this right i didnt think it was possible thanks no its not possible the likely things thats happening is that the hot water cylinder is heated by the central heating boiler the cylinder may also have an immersion heater element in it as well to heat the hot water if the heating boiler fails in older systems the immersion heater would have been used in the summer for the hot water when the heating in usually off but this is a rare thing these days  HVAC Water heater Boiler Furnace Solar power Central heating Samovar Thermal power station Fossil fuel power plant Rail terminology Radiator Steam engine Steam locomotive nomenclature 2-10-10-2 Stirling engine Process control Sauna Internal combustion engine Novelty (locomotive) Torpedo Brewery Solar panel Oxygen sensor Coffee Hot air balloon Explosive material Wood fuel High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program Cold fusion Renewable energy Environmental concerns with electricity generation Diesel engine Energy Spark plug Air conditioning Heat Three-phase electric power Passive solar Vacuum tube Tesla coil William Murdoch Engine cooling Hyperthermia Electrical element Autonomous building Convection Washing machine Apollo 13 Solar collector Slow cooker Limp Bizkit Live steam Marine aquarium Fire fighting Steam explosion Incineration Bathing Ironing Fuel injection Heat exchanger Superheater Two-stroke cycle Aquarium Town gas Electrolysis Nuclear meltdown Central processing unit Temperature Heating element Sento Liquid crystal Refrigerator Home repair Rainhill Trials Climate of the United Kingdom Carburetor Stove Chevrolet Corvair Cookware and bakeware Manitoba Hydro Red Hot Chili Peppers Steam Peltier-Seebeck effect MRE Basement Cray-2 Hot spring Customs and etiquette of Japan Timeline of steam power Bi-metal Siphon Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Wood pulp Smokebox Movie projector Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics Baptism Billboard Hot 100

any maintenance experts on kids have just smashed the glass in my front door not the first time this used to be a safe neighberhood how do i fix it a slightly expensive but very effective way to prevent that from happening again is to replace the glass with thick lexan not plexiglass lexan is almost impossible to break and is used to bullet proof cashier windows etc in thicker gauges if needs to be securely installed because the wood will break before the lexan does even a baseball bat won't go through it in fact if it is installed correctly it will do more damage to the bat wielder than to the door as an example i watched a student on a security tape take a bat to a school door glass that had been broken several times the last time it was broken the maintenance group installed lexan instead of tempered glass the student broke both wrists and cut his head with the bat when it rebounded off the lexan the children's parents were not sympathetic to his injuries  Glass Drill bit Mattress Batting average Columbine High School massacre Sammy Sosa 1919 World Series Baseball Gary Sheffield Table tennis Floppy disk Traumatic brain injury Laws of cricket Fast bowling Spark plug Ty Cobb Rais massacre Twelve Swords of Power Textile manufacturing Window Windows XP Terminal ballistics 1957 World Series Baseball statistics Lexan Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Single bullet theory Andr__s Galarraga Nalgene Door M60 machine gun R110B (New York City Subway car) Baseball bat The Shining (film) Washroom Wood Babe Ruth Batting (cricket) Polymethyl methacrylate Tai Chi Chuan Fire extinguisher Weight training Knife Motorcycle helmet Windows Vista Patch (computing) Paddle (spanking) Shield Golf The Brady Bunch Cathode ray tube Softball Cartridge (firearms) Solar power Rail tracks Los Angeles Dodgers Violin Max Payne Knight Rider Plastic Crime prevention through environmental design Naval mine Elevator Hank Aaron Bedbug Jam (TV series) Wayne Corporation Table saw Shaggy dog story VHS The Doors Porsche 993 Solar cell Stopping power Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Dishwasher Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder New York Knicks International League Aikido Repetitive strain injury Safe-cracking Diving suit Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) School bus G-Man (Half-Life) Lee Harvey Oswald About a Boy Srebrenica massacre De Lorean DMC-12 Bicycle helmet Nuclear power Heckler & Koch USP Optical fiber StarCraft: Uprising Blood Simple Escape from New York Lou Gehrig Airbag

hvac problem living room stays cool bedrooms don't for some reason my living room and kitchen stays cool but the three bedrooms seem much warmer the thermostat is in the living room so i have to turn it down to or so to keep the bedrooms comfortable i've even tried to close some the of the vents in the living room so maybe i could get more to the bedrooms without wasting the air in the living room any help with my problem the windows aren't producing a draft and seemed to be sealed just fine do not listen to the chief ducts do not get loose on theri own however spence is on the right track depending on the age of the home and ductwork it sounds as if you have a balancing issue when we design a heating cooling system for a home we have to perform an engineering load to determine how many btuh's that the house and individual rooms have then we can design the ductwork to be able to handle the individual room loads this information should be passed to the installation crew the proper way to install ductwork today is with dampered collars and flexible ductwork pulled taught with no turns now where most companies fail is in the follow up where you go back in with a draft hood that will measure how much airflow is coming out of each vent we take the numbers off of the design criteria and balance each damper to adjust the volume of air in each room to the design criteria now you the homeowner know that each room is getting the appropriate amount of airflow to each room despite where the thermostat is located to see how balancing works you can go to http www nationalcomfortinstitute com or you can see how we performed an air balancing for a local radio host in our market and how it made a difference in her home go to http www howellsac com and look for lori kelly if you require more information you can contact me through our website at http www howellsac com  Carburetor Furnace Thermostat Fume hood Thermal power station P-47 Thunderbolt Equine conformation Jet engine Fuel injection Autonomous building Loudspeaker Air conditioning Kitchen Car handling Helicopter Transformer Windows 2000 Renewable energy Dairy Solar power B-47 Stratojet Explosive material Uniform Resource Locator Tire Spark plug Tank M16 (rifle) Nuclear power Supercharger Propeller Domain Name System Web crawler Passenger car HyperText Transfer Protocol Bong Internal combustion engine Dodge Neon Japanese tea ceremony World Wide Web Pebble bed reactor Parachute Diving suit Heat Two-stroke cycle Messerschmitt Bf 109 Central processing unit Chevrolet Corvair engine Transmission Control Protocol Turbocharger Turbofan Japanese toilet Network address translation Solar cell Manifold vacuum Ocean thermal energy conversion Embedded system Electrophysiology Glider Mercury Atlas 6 Surveillance Fan (implement) Radio controlled airplane Audiophile Hydrogen economy Mutual fund Drag racing Computer cooling Wind power Drill bit Carbon dioxide Electrical wiring Aerodynamics Fire fighting Supercomputer Website Axial compressor Swamp cooler Windows XP Nuclear reactor RISC Glass Hard disk Single Transferable Vote Web server Timpani Home improvement Elevator Weighing scale Internal ballistics

for a window air conditioning do you recirculate air or draw fresh air from outside there's a switch that lets me either recirculate the air or draw air in from outside now recirculating may save energy but lead to 'stale' air drawing from the outside warmer air would use more energy but the air in the room would not be 'stale' any informed thoughts about this thanks yes it's a bit of an inane question hey it doesn't really matter the small amount of outside air drawn in is negligible mostly it is for people who have a window unit serving a closed room say an office or bedroom and due to the closed environment it is nice to have some sort of air replenishment otherwise i wouldn't have it open at all the loss of cooling capacity is the main issue most a c's struggle in summer to maintain a comfortable level and i wouldn't add to the internal load by having that vent open just my years a c experience talking there  HVAC Carburetor Solar power Autonomous building CPU cache Turbocharger Energy development Fume hood Wind power Nuclear power Thermal power station Automobile emissions control Loudspeaker Explosive material Hydropower Hydroponics Windows 2000 Air conditioning Theory of conduct Brewery Cold fusion Global warming Jet engine Battery (electricity) Ocean thermal energy conversion Ecology Glass Carbon dioxide Passenger car Thermostat Urban heat island E85 Fuel injection Transformer Heinkel He 100 Severe weather terminology (United States) Diving suit Electrophysiology Heat capacity Four-stroke cycle Ventilation Domain Name System Scramjet Water (molecule) M16 (rifle) Pebble bed reactor Hydroelectricity Heat Friends Circuit breaker Nuclear reactor Deep lake water cooling Energy economics X Window System Extreme Programming Thermoregulation Tidal power Ozone depletion Dry cleaning Climate of the United Kingdom Person Superconductivity Rebreather Mass Future energy development Humidity Coffee OpenOffice.org Equine conformation Daylight saving time Japanese tea ceremony Datalore (TNG episode) Environmental concerns with electricity generation Gas core reactor rocket Build engine Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Swimming pool Alcohol fuel Fixed-wing aircraft B-47 Stratojet Fuel efficiency Natural Selection (computer game) Solar cell Wilton House Futurama (TV series - season 5) Marathon (computer game) Cell (biology) Nutrition Ozone hole GunZ The Duel Big Brother (USA TV series) Blood on the Tracks Corrosion Scuba set Jumping the shark Hot air balloon Energy

does anyone know which swimming pool pump has the best value for the money for both pool and spa i had a pool built just years ago my spa is not generating any bubbles or jets as it was the first year it has a hayward pump to filter both pool and spa this was highly recommended by the builder but now my pool cleaner guy cleans the filter every week so the spa can get some pressure he says that he wouldn't have bought a hayward pump also said he would have another pump for the spa i don't know anything about pools and want to learn so i don't have to second guess everyone in the pool business i don't have money to burn like some friends of mine that just keeps paying a pool guy to fix everything for them i would like to do it myself and save my money any comments or suggestions are welcomed thank you in advance the pump is probably not the problem i would guess the filter is getting plugged up how often do you backwash it and if it is a sand filter how old is the sand in it sand is only good for about two years and if it has a paper type filter cartridge these can be cleaned and or replaced as well and that will make a huge difference in the pressure as you know filters do not last very long a paper filter if used four months a year should be replaced every two years for max operating pressure it does not seem like this would help that much but you would be surprised as far as the pump swim quip makes a good pump  Carburetor Swimming pool Motor oil Diving E85 Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Heinkel He 100 Solar power Diesel engine Fountain Water supply Dialysis Energy development Mutual fund Thermal power station Sewage treatment Loudspeaker Brewery Inkjet printer Turbocharger Rifle Welding Hydraulic machinery Two-stroke cycle Siphon Dairy Tire Make money fast Deflation (economics) Sauna Vacuum cleaner Phase-locked loop Vacuum Bong Space shuttle main engine Publication of Darwin's theory Jet engine Electronic organ Cranford, New Jersey Bretton Woods system Hydrogen economy Carbon dioxide Dry cleaning Ocean's Twelve Autonomous building South Bank Parklands, Brisbane Nintendo 64 Insurance Gross domestic product Portable stove Locomotive Mortgage Breastfeeding Automobile emissions control Piccolo Junior Saga Ocean thermal energy conversion Carnivorous plant Hot tub Habbo Hotel Hard disk BS 1363 Little Britain Diving suit Pump It Up Windows XP Droitwich Spa Infusion pump Marine aquarium Peer review Carl G.

why did my clothes dryer vent catch fire the strange thing is that the dryer was not even running nor had it been running recently when the fire happened the washer was running at the time the washer and dryer plug into seperate wall outlets as well we also make it a point to clean the lint remover after every dryer cycle thanks for your responses thanks for all the responses my landlord checked it and the power cord was touching the dryer vent and somehow got hot enough to ignite it he is replacing the dryer thank goodness it almost has to be an old dryer with a standing pilot the new dryers don't have those so are safer the only other explanation would be that this is not the first lint fire in the dryer and that the insulation on the wires got burnt off and they can now touch and cause sparks which would ignite a fire sounds like its time for a new dryer either way  Spark plug Reading spark plugs for racing Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Thermal power station Dry cleaning Residual-current device Internal combustion engine Washing machine Campfire High-voltage hazards Upholstery Motor oil Cruising (maritime) Electrical wiring Firearm Violin Japanese toilet Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis National Electrical Code (US) Diving suit Transformer Two-stroke cycle Thermostat Spontaneous human combustion Fire fighting Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Hydrogen peroxide Ignition system Four-stroke cycle Engine knocking BS 1363 Rocket fuel Apollo 8 Fuse (electrical) Space disaster Carburetor Furnace STS-61 Cartridge (firearms) Carbon dioxide Automobile emissions control Hindenburg disaster M60 machine gun Dualism (philosophy of mind) Glossary of firefighting terms Steam engine Laundry Toilet Fire Tier One Mains electricity Diesel engine Spark gap Apollo 1 Space shuttle main engine IPod Seismic retrofit Solar power Menstrual cup Tinder Volcano E85 Syphon Filter Model rocket Lithium ion battery Cheating in Counter-Strike Briggs & Stratton Incandescent light bulb Top Fuel Oxyacetylene Casting Samovar Blasting cap Air conditioning White phosphorus incendiary Basement Bullet Model aircraft Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Volleyball Tesla coil Space Shuttle program Textile manufacturing Knife Electrical breakdown Biodiesel Soap Machine gun Wild ARMs 2 Jack plug The Ark in Space Diaper Social rule Stirling engine Dishwasher Wood fuel Aircraft engine Wood Glossary of firefighting equipment Distributor

our hot water heater is leaking from the top our hot water heater is leaking from the top both the cold inlet and hot output pipes are pushing up water at the point where they connect to the tank is this something that can be fixed by replacing the fittings or is this an indication that the tank needs to be replaced it is years old and we get lake michigan water from chicago you should have a valve on the cold water supply that will shut the water off to the water heater turn the water off and open the hot and cold at any faucet if the cold water does not stop then the shut off valve is bad and needs to be replaced you can shut the water off at the meter or at a valve near the house to do this opening a faucet will relieve the pressure on the tank you should have a flexible line to the hot and cold sides of the nipples at the water heater disconnect those flexible lines and use a pipe wrench to remove the nipples that are threaded into the tank purchase new nipples and some pipe thread sealing compound coat the threads with the compound and screw them into the tank make sure they are tight reconnect the flex lines and slowly turn on the water open faucets to bleed off the air this should do it  Tap (valve) Carburetor Hydraulic machinery Glossary of firefighting equipment Thermal power station Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Diesel engine Tire Plumbing fixture Apollo 13 Flush toilet Space shuttle main engine Rail terminology Diving regulator Siphon Furnace Screw Bong Fossil fuel power plant Air brake (rail) Seismic retrofit Two-stroke cycle Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Brewery Spark plug Water heater Domestic water system Rebreather Solar power Wrench Samovar Sento Chevrolet Corvair engine Irrigation Apollo Command/Service Module Town gas Newcomen steam engine Manifold vacuum HVAC Oxyacetylene Three Mile Island BS 1363 Fuel injection Containment building Drill bit Fire hydrant Motor oil Home repair Space Shuttle external tank Scuba set Turbocharger Four-stroke cycle Coffee Glossary of firefighting terms Snorkel Programmable logic controller Energy development Autonomous building Solar panel Cruising (maritime) Hot air balloon Gasoline Carbon dioxide Motorcycle Aquarium Pulse jet engine Novelty (locomotive) Jet engine Radiator Baby bottle Basement B-47 Stratojet Internal ballistics Hard water Snowboard Apollo 6 Submarine SR-71 Blackbird Counter-Strike Professional wrestling holds Casting Rail tracks Chevrolet Corvair Rifle Tank Fluid pressure Water hammer E85 Reading spark plugs for racing Poppet valve

what does a water softener do month after month i dump bags of salt into our water softner i started to wonder a where does all that salt go and are we consuming it b where do all the minerals go that are supposedly removed to soften the water c why does soft water always leave you feel like you cannot get the soap off the salt you add is for you cation exchange column hardness in the water is due to minerals calcium and magnesium in your water with hard water you need to use more soap to clean your clothes dishes etc it also leaves a residue on sinks tubs dishes glasses your clothes and in your water heater cation exchange works on a give an take the salt dissolves and sodium na ions attach themselves to little beads in your resin bed cation exchange column as your hard water flows through the bed the calcium ca and magnesium mg ions push the sodium ions off the beads the resin prefers ca and mg ions once most of the sodium is replaced with calcium and magnesium the bed needs to regenerated usually established by a timer during regeneration the bed is flushed with concentrated salt water and sodium ions push the ca and mg ions off the beads the ca and mg ions are released as waste water usually this water goes to the sewer with your other waste water sometimes it discharges to peoples yard which is not preferred since the concentrated hardness can damage your plants or grass as for your last question if you feel like you can't get the soap off you might want to get your system checked since that is usually a result of hard water it sounds like your exchange system might need new resin or perhaps you need to adjust your regeneration schedule  Water purification Ion exchange resin Hydrochloric acid Soil pH Water (molecule) Thermal power station Salt Sewage treatment Soap Sodium chloride Sodium sulfate Industrial wastewater treatment Citric acid Sulfuric acid Tofu Sodium Sodium carbonate Mineral Chromatography Aluminium Electrolyte Sulfur Pyroxene Dialysis Corrosion Dead Sea Action potential Water Magnesium Carbon dioxide Edible salt Mattress Chlorine Casting Weathering Base (chemistry) Ion selective electrode Hydrogen chloride Membrane potential Hamster Brewery Fluoride Resin Nuclear power Ion Fossil fuel power plant Soldering Ammonia Sodium hydroxide Laundry detergent Fire extinguisher Autonomous building Potassium Dry cleaning Illegal drug trade Rebreather Fecal incontinence Lithium Sea water Textile manufacturing Glycerin Hardpan Japanese toilet Montmorillonite Leblanc process Alcohol Cannabis cultivation Haloalkane Electrophysiology Hydroponics Flue gas desulfurization Desert Nuclear reactor Acid mine drainage Kidney Urine Milk Systematic name Bong Cyanide Calcium Alum Steel Strap-on dildo Sodium percarbonate Alkane Borax Acetic acid Caliche Calcium chloride Ammonium Dairy Garnet Glass

what should the press be on the high side low side at dredges out side air temp on a ton unit it depends on the efficiency of your condenser but probabloy somewhere in the range of from psi like i said it depends on the efficiency of your condenser it doesn't matter that it's a heat pump older air conditioners run up to psi that's not excessive most technicians would check a thing called subcooling to determine if the condenser was actually doing it's job correctly the low side pressure should be somewhere around psi that equals saturated temperature of the refrigerant again i say it deepends on the efficiency of the unit the temperature of the house and the relative humidity of the house most technicians would check a thing called superheat on this side of the system a good technician would also check the relative tumidity and temperature of the house and use a superheat charging chart to determine a good superheat for those conditions it's not all about pressures too many people think they can determine the operating conditions by using pressures a good technincian would also check to see if you had a good temperature difference of the air across the indoor coil difference give or take would be too low and would be too high again it depends on the present conditions in your house of course if everything was perfect in your house you probably would not be asking if it has been on and cooling the house for a while then those pressures would be acceptable  Air conditioning Thermal power station Steam engine Water vapor Ocean thermal energy conversion Fossil fuel power plant Explosive material Carburetor Thermostat Phase change heat pump Relative humidity Turbocharger Heat Spark plug Phase (matter) Temperature Hydraulic machinery Transformer Jet engine Gas compressor Circuit design E85 Swamp cooler Solar power HVAC Stirling engine Humidity Welding Carbon dioxide Superconductivity Motor oil Microphone Diesel engine Vacuum Furnace Diode Superheater Inflation Refrigerator Hydrogen Houseplant Dirac equation Brewery Oxygen sensor Internal combustion engine Adiabatic lapse rate Turbofan Hydropower Axial compressor Thermoregulation Weather lore Autonomous building Heat equation Gas absorption refrigerator Water (molecule) Identical particles Two-stroke cycle Nuclear fusion Hydrogen economy Nuclear explosion Three Mile Island Water purification Turbojet Ammonia Climate of the United Kingdom National Weather Service Fuel injection Spacecraft propulsion Solar cell Hot air balloon Supply and demand Alkane Dairy Quantum computer Bleed air Renormalization Pressurized water reactor Incandescent light bulb Wind power Big Bang Equine conformation Frost STS-62 Peltier-Seebeck effect Heinkel He 100 Boiling Microeconomics Diving cylinder Pebble bed reactor Cold fusion Insulation Mooney M20 Evaporative cooling Heat index

how can i remove ink or maker stains from my white leather sofa any product recommendations if it is on a pigmented leather which i think yours will be then the first thing you should try is an ltt ink stick the fresher the ink the more chance you have of removing it it is a good idea to have one in your house if you have a pale leather you should also be using a good quality leather protector on your suite this will act like a 'scotchgard' and will make any more mishaps easier to clean off if an ink stick doesn't work a solvent based remover will need to be used and it may also remove finish and pigment so is best left to the experts using hairspray is very risky as it can make the matter far worse as it can spread the ink over a bigger area especially on an aniline style leather and can sometimes then be impossible to fix nail varnish remover or any other solvents will remove the finish and pigment which will need replacing do not use baby wipes as they are about the worst thing you can use on a leather as they break down the finish and will eventually ruin it please do not try milk it is a silly idea that this will work and will leave sticky residues on the surface which will help to break down the finish if the ink is on an aniline style there is nothing that will remove it because the ink will have re dyed the leather it may dissipate over time with cleaning and protecting old ink will be harder to remove than new ink and may mean resorting to solvents which will also remove the finish this is probably best left to the experts silicones furniture polish are the worst thing to use on leather as they will form a coating on the surface of the leather which will not allow any moisture to get to the leather and will eventually break all the finish down and make it crack leather needs water and should not be protected against it leather does not need conditioning it needs cleaning and protecting on a regular basis with water based products this will keep it rehydrated and supple oils will make things much worse leather should be cleaned gently not scrubbed so 'elbow grease' will only do damage to the finish nail varnish remover solvents will remove the finish on the leather even if you cannot tell it is doing so and alcohol may do the same depending on the strength of the finish on the leather source s http www lttsolutions net leather care consultnts to the furniture and cleaning industries  Upholstery Leather Dry cleaning Knife Plastic Violin Manicure Woodworking Printed circuit board Pottery Tattoo Acetic acid Inkjet printer Soap Drawing Tooth Brush Mattress Textile manufacturing Biodiesel Cross-country skiing Dairy Corrosion Coffee Shoe polish Water (molecule) Drill bit Soy protein Welding Water Brewery Strap-on dildo Perfume Hemp Soldering Wood Coal Lacquer Chromium Aniline Dye Solvent Fecal incontinence Bong Sewage treatment Hydrogen peroxide Casting Benzene Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Turquoise Explosive material Chair Cast iron Aluminium Extreme Programming Haloalkane Tofu BASF Shampoo Color theory Diving suit Brazing Wok Wood carving Inflation Poker jargon Painter and decorator Diamond Clinker (boat building) Seismic retrofit Tanning Motor oil Home repair Keynesian economics Industrial wastewater treatment Computer virus Concentration Disc brake Pastel Windows XP Laser engraving Solar cell Gilding Silly Putty Skin Theory of conduct Menstrual cup Glycerin

what would cause a water heater with two functional thermostats functional electric to stop heating water my water heater has stopped heating water both thermostats are working and there is a good electrical current to the heater but there is no hot water coming out of it a water heater has parts to it the tank of course then on a std house unit it will have thermostats top and bottom then heating elements top and bottom now when u first turn on a water heater power is sent to the top element heatingp the top half of the heater since that is where the hot water comes from now when u pull water from there the new cold water comign in goes to the bottom of the tank thru a diptube mang the bottom return on first making it run more so most likely it is ur bottom element that has gone out but since ur going to have to open the panels to replace it might as well do both while ur at it so u wont have to do the next one in a month or two  Thermostat HVAC Apollo 13 Furnace Solar power Autonomous building Refrigerator Water heater Thermal power station Radiator Samovar Fossil fuel power plant Heat Hot air balloon Solar panel Bi-metal Vacuum tube Process control Ironing Carburetor Steam engine Mars Exploration Rover Rail terminology Town gas Heating element Water (molecule) Energy development Diesel engine Fan (implement) Energy Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Wood fuel Marine aquarium Brewery Soldering iron Renewable energy Ford Ranger EV Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Phase change heat pump Thermocouple Three-phase electric power Transistor Toyota Prius Wind power Seismic retrofit Fire fighting Solar collector Welding Basement Torpedo Electrical element Passive solar Peltier-Seebeck effect Deep lake water cooling Electrical wiring Sento Cruising (maritime) Transformer Cold fusion 1957 World Series Hydrogen economy Bong Bread Coffee Central heating Standard enthalpy change of fusion Spacecraft propulsion Three Mile Island Injection moulding Gas turbine Kitchen Slow cooker Nuclear reactor Hysteresis Cyclic process Canal lock Titanium Alternative fuel Waterbed Diving suit Elevator Spark plug Armoured warfare Motor oil Washing machine Chevrolet Corvair Rice cooker Railway signalling Heat pump Fuse (electrical) Tesla coil Temperature Electricity meter Hydropower Quicksort Relay Hydrogen vehicle B-47 Stratojet

buzzing in wall every few months when i close my laundry room door you can hear a loud buzzing it goes away when you open or shut the door again it has gone and returned several times it sounds almost like a dryer buzzer do i need to fix this is it dangerous well i don't think it is the dryer buzzer just sounds like it i don't think it's bees i only hear the noise every few months i wonder if it's a wire loose or something to determine what needs to be done you must first identify the source of the noise are you ever in the room when it makes the noise you say the noise sounds like the dryer buzzer but goes away when you open the door to the room if your dryer buzzer is the noise the only way opening the laundry room door would effect it would perhaps be a slight change of air pressure to the room causing the dryer door to be pressed in a little or even puled out a little the dryer buzzer is not usually effected by the door but rather it is effected by the timer start the dryer and as it runs push and pull a little on the dryer door and see if you can cause the sound to appear if this doesn't work i keep trying to identify the source i can't think of anything else with what you've posted  Microphone Scrabble (game show) Hurdy gurdy Quizbowl Sound Hearing aid Loudspeaker Whose Line Is It Anyway?

cost of finishing a basement i have a sq ft basement to finish what is the approximate cost to include a bathroom and finish the basement is there already plumbing for a toilet installed in the basement if not you can get the toilets that are made to flush up instead of down as far as cost to do your sq ft basement i have no clue new houses are per sq ft for garbage on up to per sq ft for something really nice probably minimum would be if you went retail and had someone else do the work of course this all depends on the area you live in if you went to auctions and did your shopping really well and did the work yourself if you do hire the work done by a contractor don't ever be shy about asking for references proof of insurance bonding and licensing and call your state board and check out he guys license and then go look at other work he has done and see that the work isn't shoddy and the customers were happy and he did what he said he was going to do i go to building material auctions and buy materials for anything i want to build the stuff ends up being just pennies on the dollar like a nice grade of hardwood flooring enough to do sq ft all in the same color and pattern cents a sq foot home depots price on the same stuff was sq ft you do have to buy bunks of stuff like a bunk of sheetrock but at cents a sheet who cares a bunk of x x 's ends up being cents per board and they are per board at home depot you can buy sinks toilets shower stalls plumbing everything you might need to build an entire house except the right color of paint if you plan on remodeling to code you will need to get a permit and if the house is yours and you don't get a building permit when you sell the house they can make you pay fines and penalties for not getting the permits and inspections as you go along with your project if you are doing the wiring yourself to you will need to get that inspected as well the one thing that i am really careful on is the wiring if the place burns down because of an illegal wiring job then insurance won't cover the loss  Wal-Mart Toilet United States Postal Service Air-raid shelter Autonomous building Japanese toilet Insurance Poker jargon ITunes Music Store Sears Holdings Corporation Microeconomics FairTax Dormitory Auction Electrical wiring Taxation in the United States Make money fast Illegal drug trade Toilet paper Plumbing fixture Gross domestic product Plastic Bank The Apprentice 2 Neopets Auto insurance Bulk vending Elevator Construction Mutual fund Home improvement Sears Catalog Home Apple Macintosh MTR Filling station Public transport Solar cell 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Predatory lending United States dollar Chatsworth House Xanadu House CPU cache Bond The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina The Amazing Race Financial services Berkshire Hathaway Bathroom Bristol Grammar School Queensbridge Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sin City Arbitrage Tax Straw-bale construction Coffee Washroom Urban sprawl Mac OS X Linux Animal Crossing Dialysis Toilet humour Drywall Flush toilet Food Stamp Program Mortgage Ice hockey Humphrey Bogart Driver's license Wood Public domain Fireworks Life insurance Firefighter Lighting Enron Corporation Brewery Drill bit Ra (board game) Warren Buffett E85 Internet fraud Motion picture rating system National Kidney Foundation Singapore Bethalto, Illinois SCO-Linux controversies Medicare (United States) Nuclear power phase-out Annuity Day trading Medical malpractice

got shocked touch the fridge and stove at same time ouch my neighbor has a very old stove gas and an old fridge pretty close together i opened the fridge with left arm and leaned back against the side of the stove and immerdeiatly got a huge shock i felt glued to the door handle for a second even the pain shock went all the way to my feet i mean it hurt pretty bad i had been swimming about an hour before and my hands and body were dry my suit the part that touched the stove and shorts were damp however my elderly neighbor said it was because i was wet but i don't think so this was one heck of a jolt my arm still hurts several hours later kind of tingly too would this be a bad ground he touched them together and felt nothing well it sounds to me like either the stove or refrig have a hot wire contacting the casing of the appliance either directly or even just slightly and im assuming that the appliances and the wiring in the house are fairly old that they possibly do not have a ground at all as a ground is not needed only a nuetral most older houses had no grounds so if this is the case you have a appliance with a hot casing sitting there waiting for a quicker path to ground other than its nuetral path so you came along along wet and making good contact with the floor and the casing of the other appliance and you became the ground this is what i think anyway  Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Residual-current device Stove Fire fighting Seismic retrofit Volleyball Refrigerator Equine conformation Aerial (dance move) Kitchen Car handling Diving suit Electroshock gun Menstrual cup Solar power Basement Milton H.

does any body know what a compasator on a heat pump unit does many electric motors that are run from single phase power like you would have at a house or small business require a capacitor it could be classified as a starting or running capacitor the motor has a couple of windings of wire which form a magnetic field which is what drives the motor by connecting a capacitor to one of the windings you cause an electrical phase shift which causes the motor to run in the correct direction a starting capacitor is switched off once the motor starts either by using a switch operated when the motor gets up to speed or by a relay which switches off when the motor current drops to a normal running level if the capacitor fails the motor will not start or will be too weak to get up to speed it will draw more current than normal and eventually either a thermal overload in the motor trips these usually reset in a couple minutes and keep trying an external overload unit trips these are usually manual reset but could be automatic or you blow the fuse breaker for the circuit a capacitor will normally last many years and is relatively inexpensive  Electric motor Circuit breaker Capacitor Transformer Circuit design Fuse (electrical) Relay Residual-current device High-voltage direct current Oscilloscope Thermal power station Tesla coil Antenna (radio) Carburetor Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Ceramics Switch Three-phase electric power Alternating current Electronic amplifier X10 (industry standard) Central processing unit Flux Electrical generator Thermostat Power factor correction Hydraulic machinery STS-61 Loudspeaker Energy development Phase-locked loop Switched-mode power supply Ford Ranger EV Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Transistor Rail terminology Printed circuit board Automobile self starter Locomotive Digital circuit Solar power Overhead lines Wind turbine Elevator Variable Frequency Drive Split phase Logic gate Electrophysiology Series and parallel circuits Floppy disk Short circuit Toyota Prius Hybrid vehicle Railgun Battery electric vehicle Power factor Fire alarm control panel Aircraft engine controls Microphone TGV Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Ring circuit Magnetic core memory Gas metal arc welding Transducer Lawn mower Electric vehicle Electrical network Electrical wiring Inductor Capacitor plague Operational amplifier Dynamic random access memory MRAM Impedance Autonomous building Plasma (physics) Telegraphy Automatic transmission Hybrid Synergy Drive 2003 North America blackout Hall effect BS 1363 Railway electrification system Power station Gliding Service life Jet engine Movie projector

death of our vacuum my eureka vacuum seems to have lost it's will to live or it's possesed i was in the middle of vacuuming our house when the circuit's popped i reset the breaker's and tried to plug the vacuum back in it was turned off and the connection started sparking before it was fully plugged in does anyone know where i can start troubleshooting can it be that the cord just needs to be replaced if someone can help i would truly appreciate it for i cannot afford to replace it right now thank you i have the same exact problem with my electric leaf blower but i've yet to fix it anyway since it was turned off and it still sparked i suspect the problem is with the portion of the wire that's before the switch or the switch itself if that's the case then it would not cost too much money to fix or replace if you know how to open the vacuum then check the connections to the switch and make sure no black wire is touching a white wire if none of the wires are touching then the problem could be with the switch just get a new one from eureka if your vacuum isn't too old it should be covered under the warranty but even if it isn't a switch should not cost that much finally if none of that solves the problem then it could be the motor clean it out and make sure nothing is stuck in the fan or motor you'll have to unscrew a couple things to get to it but it's not that hard to do it  Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Carburetor Switch Electric motor Residual-current device BS 1363 Thermostat Relay Fan (implement) Enigma machine Vacuum tube Circuit breaker Fuse (electrical) Computer IPod Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Distribution board Oscilloscope Spark gap Violin Central processing unit STS-61 Three-phase electric power Ignition system Embedded system Rail terminology Digital circuit Transistor USB flash drive Electrical wiring (UK) Welding Mouse (computing) Overhead lines Jack plug Toyota Prius X10 (industry standard) Dairy Ford Ranger EV Solar power Ground and neutral Circuit design Distributor Light switch Incandescent light bulb History of computing hardware Secure Digital card Poker jargon Universal Serial Bus Tesla coil Telephone exchange Cray-1 Alternating current Modem Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Electronic amplifier Computer forensics Electrical generator National Electrical Code (US) Fluorescent lamp Wire Lightning rod Ethernet Mattress Vacuum cleaner Aluminium Motor oil Maxwell's equations Power strip Exact solutions in general relativity Hearing aid Firearm Aircraft engine controls Logic gate Transmitter Professional wrestling slang Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Integrated circuit Model aircraft Gauge theory High-voltage direct current Windows XP Motorcycle Debugging Reading spark plugs for racing Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Xbox Kerr metric Telephone Printed circuit board Modchip Floppy disk Brain Hall effect Battery electric vehicle Pinball Coaxial cable

btu air conditioner makes power go down all the time why every minutes i have to go to the fuse box to restart power this is very annoying any solution guys it s too hot these days thanks as the ac runs it is probably not defective or drawing too much current check the current rating on the ac and the rating of the breaker the breaker may have too low a rating for the ac current if the ac ever worked without operating the breaker perhaps the breaker is defective they are not expensive so you could have it changed if the breaker rating is too low one with a higher rating could be installed first though you need to know the safe current for the size of the conductors from the breaker panel to the ac if all this sounds beyond your abilities you need help from a more knowledgeable person  Circuit breaker Fuse (electrical) Residual-current device Domestic AC power plugs and sockets BS 1363 Relay Three-phase electric power Solar cell Thermal power station Alternating current Capacitor Ground and neutral Circuit design National Electrical Code (US) Electrical wiring Solar power High-voltage direct current Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Jet engine Oscilloscope Nuclear fusion Electrical breakdown Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Ring circuit Lightning rod Distribution board Wind power Short circuit Renewable energy Transformer Vacuum tube Gas metal arc welding Nuclear reactor Solar panel Spark plug Loudspeaker Booting Split phase Incandescent light bulb STS-61 Coal Alcohol fuel GunZ The Duel Universal Serial Bus Fusion power Railway signalling Voltage drop Electrical wiring (UK) Lac operon Virtual memory Electrophysiology Nuclear fuel cycle Pebble bed reactor Axial compressor Electric power transmission Manitoba Hydro Contact breaker Blue screen of death Tidal power Air conditioning Paintball Welding Thermostat Wood Electrician Ground (electricity) Embedded system E85 Space Shuttle program Ampere Central processing unit Seismic retrofit Hall effect Anthracite coal Autonomous building Wind turbine Fossil fuel power plant Spacecraft propulsion Literacy Inflation Flat tax Transformers: Cybertron Pyramid (game show) Conductor (material) Soap opera Defense of the Ancients Audiophile Titanium Energy development Power (physics) Nuclear power CPU cache CPU design Doomsday argument Horsepower Gas tungsten arc welding Appliance classes Dorama

i need help with my sink erator usually when i flip the switch the water goes down the sink but nowadays the water comes up out of the sink when i turn on the ise sink erator does anyone have any ideas of why this might be happening thanks the blades spin but the water comes out many garbage disposals do a fair but not good job of grinding the partly ground garbage passed through the disposal's screens and have collected in the trap under the sink take everything out from under the sink everything unplug the disposal so no one turns it on get a bucket and place it under the trap the u shaped line with screw on mounting fittings get at least one if not extra buckets nearby as you may need them use a flashlight for light not electric powered light as you may have water to contend with open one of the fittings on the trap and let the water drain into the bucket switch buckets as needed it is better to do this slowly and let the water drain rather than open it fully and have water all over the place once all the water has drained empty the buckets but leave one bucket under the trap and ultimately replace the bucket with an empty bucket although the water may be foul smelling you can dump it in on the lawn if it has ground garbage in it do not dump it in another sink as it will plug it now fully remove the trap and let the trap fall into the bucket put another bucket under the open line remove the vertical line all the way back to the garbage disposal take the trap and all of the drain line you removed outside and clean it completely rinising it with a garden hose can do the job let this drip dry outside now back under the kitchen sink look into the disposal from the vent line flash light needed and see if there is garbage in it if so remove the disposal take it out and rinse it completely clear do not get water on the disposal motor let things dry now reassemble everything and check for leaks if you have rubber gaskets on the drain line replace them if they are worn or you will have leaks all should now be ok  Plumbing fixture Lawn mower Irrigation Tire Autonomous building Dairy Thermal power station Sento Motor oil The Dalek Invasion of Earth Carburetor Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Sewage treatment Menstrual cup Oxyacetylene Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Dialysis Landfill Domestic water system Dredge E85 Yohoho!

he added freon gas into my home ac and charged me how do i know if the charge is reasonable or not my keeprite home ac didn't work properly the service guy came and replaced a v capacitor and charged me canadian dollars then he added freon gas in from psi to psi and charged me he said the price for freon gas is psi in addition he charged me labor for about hours work in my home i felt ripped off a simple search finds that a similar capacitor is about any one can tell me the price of freon gas in similar situation as a non technical guy in need of ac service how do i know if his charge is reasonable or not can i complain to his company and get some money back please help the freon is r in fact the didn't complete the fix it started to work and stopped after one or two hours after several hours i started the ac again and it worked for another one or two hours then stopped the service guy came again reversed the turning direction of the colling fan looks like it is finally fixed thanks for all answers my point is how customers know the charges parts are right or not in that situation if you spend an hour to search the price on the net you will be charged for another because the service guy is on site waiting for you the time to ask this question was before the work was done perfect in theory but not practical you have to pay just for the guy to come and you have little knowledge and little choice to turn down his estimate i simply asked a question that how would a customer know if the charge is reasonable or not some a c guy started getting angry or scared this only reminds us that we can not trust them honest people would welcome these questions i do services and i know if you are not open and fair you do not get trust btw the company i used is air tech in toronto richmond area i would leave you to judge it was fair or not something doesn't sound quite right especially about the freon fyi freon is just a brand name for refrigerant since you're canadian r is still a very popular refrigerant there and systems will be manufatured in the us with r until the year and mostl likely unless your a c is over years old r is the refrigerant used if it's over that in age it could be r and r is extremely expensive depending on how low the charge was in your system the price he charged may not be too far out of line you also don't say if it's a window unit or a central system the average going rate in the us for labor on hvac systems is to us per hour i don't have the exact conversion rate handly but i'm guessing to canadian wouldn't be to far off so if he worked about minutes that labor charge would be about right as far as the capacitor goes one about the same isn't the same as one exactly the same if you still feel like you got ripped off call the servicing company and ask them to explain the charges in detail  Haloalkane Microeconomics Labor theory of value Air conditioning Cray-1 Theory of conduct FairTax Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Circuit design Inflation Extreme Programming Explosive material Supply and demand Tax GED Dirac equation Gross domestic product Refrigerator Social rule Surplus value Time Out of Mind Mutual fund United Kingdom corporation tax Capacitor StarCraft Episode VI Labour economics Normal distribution Poker jargon Traumatic incident reduction Windows XP Coming of Age (TNG episode) Insurance Publicly funded medicine Ammonia Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Friends Law of value Many-worlds interpretation Expert system IP (complexity) 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Avenue Q Identical particles The Amazing Race Economics Unemployment Diving cylinder Flat tax Electrophysiology Plame affair Shaggy dog story Kyle Broflovski Euro CPU design 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Philosophical skepticism Wheel of Fortune Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) America Online The Price Is Right North American Numbering Plan Capital accumulation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Microphone Domain Name System Ben Johnson (athlete) Keynesian economics Audiophile CPU cache The Apprentice 2 Efficiency wages EastEnders Prices of production Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Economy of the United States Social Security (United States) Goodness and value theory Modem Episodes of Lost (Season 1) E-mail spam Health insurance Computer HVAC Wal-Mart Atari 8-bit family Capitalism Belief revision Rebreather Citigroup Game programmer High-speed rail Refrigeration Windows Vista Road pricing Mortgage Fluorescent lamp

what is the acrylic bar called in the bath tub where can i buy a new one help in my bathtub the acrylic bar in the tub you can use it to help get up out of the tub or you can hang a wash cloth over it i have googled it and cannot find it broke and we need a new one please help it isn't a grab bar or handicap bar it is plastic or acrylic and it comes standard in many showers it is a part of the shower encloser its call a grab bar or a handicap bar its usually made of metal though there are some acrylic you can find them in the bath section of home improvement over by toiletpaper holders and shower heads i understand what you mean now you mean the plastic rod that is molded into the tub surround itself well i never had to actually replace this however i called around to some plumbing supply places and they said whatever brand it was you can call the company directly but you may not know that most surrounds dont' have the name stamped on them or for that matter know the model number used my suggestion is to go to measure the lenght and the diameter needed go to homedepot and look in the bath isle where the tp holders and the towel bars are and look for the closest one you can find you may have to cut it down they can probably do it for you as well if you can't find an plastic or acrylic one your best bet may go to the wood trim section and they have wood dowels there you can easily cut this and just primer and paint with good waterproof paint now the real question is getting it to go in there when surrounds are installed they are flexible so you can bend back the surround and fit in it but with it already glued you may have trouble my suggestion is take and cut it to where you can stick one end as far in the hole as possible mark the other side tight as you can then cut it take some good silcone caulk and caulk both the holes insert one end fully into the hole then insert the other one making both sides equally distanced caulk around the dowel  Drill bit Plastic Casting Upholstery Textile manufacturing Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Genericized trademark Gramophone record Bong Textile manufacturing terminology Strap-on dildo Knife Floppy disk Boat building Table saw View camera Internal ballistics Brush Domestic water system Guitar Violin Scale model Customs and etiquette of Japan Golf Professional wrestling match types Epoxy Laser engraving Deck (ship) Sundial Tire Pottery Manicure M16 (rifle) Slide rule Timpani Mattress Harmonica Sento Polymethyl methacrylate Dymaxion house Toilet paper Poker jargon Shoe Professional wrestling throws Hamster Japanese toilet Explosive material Diving regulator Menstrual cup The Inside Toilet Top-bar hive Optical fiber Swimming pool Acrylic paint Geodesic dome Billiards Cartridge (firearms) Glossary of nautical terms Hearing aid Glossary of American football Black hole United States Postal Service Stairway Canoe Bathing Swimming De Lorean DMC-12 Nudity Sauna Mouse (computing) Plumbing fixture Intraocular lens Dialysis Dinghy Bassoon Electrical wiring English longbow Door Firearm Go (board game) Professional wrestling holds Hot tub Nail (anatomy) Transformer Clarinet BS 1363 Non-native pronunciations of English Rigging Dice Glass

i really need help with my central air unit any advice would be truly appreciated thanks i'll try my best to be as detailed as possible i have a goodman central air unit it was working great and then one day the air suddenly wasnt flowing through the vents like it should i mean its like a cool low pressure air where the cool air is being felt somewhat through the vents but not at a force like before to cool the house i thought at first it was my coils that needed to be cleaned so i cleaned the coils on the compressor really well and even changed my fliter which that was strange too because i use to have to slide my fliter in and this time as i was sliding my filter in it was like something just sucked it right in like a vacume well i then flipped the breaker from on to off and then back on and still cant get the air to come through enough now my fan on my compressor is blowing out cool air instead of hot air and its not even blowing it out at a higher pressure someone told me that it sounds like my ducts could be clog could that be it and if so how do i check it it sounds like you have a blower restriction or dirty coil letting the system run like that can cause the compressor to fail your best bet is to call a serviceman  Air conditioning Jet engine Thermostat HVAC Axial compressor Thermal power station Two-stroke cycle Turbocharger Turbojet Gas compressor Turbofan Bass guitar Carburetor Supercharger Bong Fan (implement) Mattress SR-71 Blackbird Furnace Solar power Motor oil Fossil fuel power plant Fume hood Swamp cooler Refrigerator Circuit breaker Diesel engine Ocean thermal energy conversion Heinkel He 100 Engine cooling Tesla coil Diving air compressor Novelty (locomotive) Pebble bed reactor Aerial (dance move) Stirling engine Propeller 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Audio level compression Gas turbine Phase change heat pump Trumpet Loudspeaker Skateboarding trick Vacuum Dodge Neon Bicycle brake systems Monsoon Electric motor Spacecraft propulsion Three-phase electric power Centrifugal compressor Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Diving cylinder Internal combustion engine Wind Fluorescent lamp Intercooler Operation Petticoat Rebreather Climate of the United Kingdom Futurama (TV series - season 5) Equine conformation Gas absorption refrigerator Computer cooling Heat Siphon Blown flap Brewery Movie projector Hyperthermia Mount Pinatubo Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Respiratory system Scramjet Soldering Casting Heat exchanger Hot air balloon Flute USS Trigger (SS-237) Hydraulic machinery Bypass ratio Chevrolet Corvair engine Windscale fire Residual-current device Diode Diving regulator Capacitor plague SpongeBob SquarePants Autonomous building Adiabatic process Aircraft Hard disk E85 Magnet Stall (flight) Space shuttle main engine

does anyone know about well water septic tanks or propane never had any of these things and now we're getting a house with all of them what are the good bad points with this stuff i've heard that you can't run the shower at the same time as your washing machine is that true how tempermental is a septic tank and do you have to get well water propane tanks or septic tanks serviced or tested how often as already stated there are many variables to consider concerning wells and septics as far as the well goes you're at the mercy of the water in your area but if you're unfortunate enough to have nasty well water don't worry because modern softening and filtration systems can take care of most issues now for the septic system treating with rid x or another kind of treatment is important as others have said and the other important rule you have to remember is no tampons down the toilet these little female mice will cause a whole load of problems now on to propane no monthly bill like natural gas usually more often only one big bill when you get the tank filled every few months many propane dealers will offer a yearly contract as well example if you think your lp consumption will be gallons for the upcoming year many companies will let you sign a contract at that time which will lock the price of your gas for the first gallons it's a good way to save money but also may be hard to estimate your usage given that you haven't lived there yet hope this helps  Autonomous building Sewage treatment Septic tank Cruising (maritime) Hydrogen economy Fuel injection Marine aquarium E85 Composting toilet Filling station Water purification Petroleum Menstrual cup Toilet paper Contract Social rule Fecal incontinence Annuity Health insurance Hard water Toyota Prius National Kidney Foundation Singapore Water heater FairTax Biodiesel Brewery Wal-Mart Tax Domestic water system Aquarium Automobile Dry cleaning Energy Policy Act of 2005 Theory of conduct Flush toilet Methanethiol Glossary of firefighting terms Group A streptococcal infection King City, Ontario Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Health care in the United States Philosophical skepticism Craps Labour economics Alcohol fuel Economy of Russia Toilet Nuclear power Sewer Gasoline Siphon 2003 North America blackout Tank truck Shock Microeconomics Pit toilet Fossil fuel power plant Blackjack Gross domestic product Natural gas Thermal power station Fuel efficiency Pneumonia 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Shit Fuel cell Gas turbine-electric locomotive Pet skunk Dairy Reef tank Economics Mark VIII (tank) Halliburton 2000 Australian Grand Prix Economy of the United States Hubbert peak theory Yugo Airsoft Water supply Grid energy storage Goodness and value theory Environmental engineering Insurance IAR 80 P-47 Thunderbolt Hybrid vehicle Outsourcing Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Japanese toilet Fountain Renewable energy Water Manitoba Hydro Poker jargon Software engineering

thank you mutantalbino exactly what i thought after the fact by the way i used a slightly wet rag to wipe those coils not even knowing they were coils and they turned from black to shiny metallic color somehow it occurred to me to take a closer look at them and that's when i realized i had closed most of the coils by mistake i just ran another rag over the coils in the opposite direction to open them up but without any success please help me with tips to open 'em back also you mentioned the condenser i hope i didn't screw that one up too all i did was to take the filter out i do know how to clean that one and like i said ran a rag over the coils i certainly hope i didn't accidentally touch or mess with the condenser thanks again you are welcome i modified my last post putting in some more details the evaporator is inside and the condenser is the unit outside a fin comb would likely be a good thing to try i frankly didn't know such a thing existed i have spent hours with a toothpick working on coils where i had hit it with a weed whacker if you have trouble finding a fin comb i suggest that you contact an hvac supply house some will sell to individuals you might check to see if they have a spray on solution for coil cleaning be sure your condensate drain is open water drain from the evaporator gunk from cleaning could cause problems and they stop up anyway  Thermal power station Air conditioning Incandescent light bulb Mattress Magnet Furnace Carburetor Soldering Heinkel He 100 Microphone Bong Textile manufacturing Heat exchanger Opportunity rover Electric motor HVAC Ocean thermal energy conversion Tesla coil Gas absorption refrigerator Dialysis Toilet paper Fossil fuel power plant Social rule Hard disk Fire fighting Swamp cooler E85 Laserdisc Solar power Phase (matter) Apollo 13 Violin Hey Jude Brewery Snooker Instant coffee Hydrogen vehicle Dry cleaning M16 (rifle) Poker jargon Blood on the Tracks Newcomen steam engine Naval mine Roswell UFO incident Black hole Tai shogi Frogman Operation Market Garden Steam engine Water Circuit design Thermostat Cannabis cultivation Glossary of firefighting equipment Refrigerator 2000 Australian Grand Prix USS Yorktown (CV-5) Kasparov versus The World 1957 World Series Dairy Spark plug Irrigation Electrophysiology Collision detection Coil (band) Ladder logic Upholstery Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Ecco the Dolphin Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Battery (electricity) Ammonite Obsessive-compulsive disorder Mercury (element) Sento Color Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Nuclear fallout One Tree Hill (TV series) Solar system Motor oil Inertial guidance system Cubic zirconia Diode Water purification The Amber Spyglass Iron Full Metal Panic?

while cleaning my airconditioner i accidentally closed off most of the inner metal vents will this ruin it if you are talking about fins on the evaporator coil the air handling unit inside you are going to have to open them back up it must have air flow to work operation could cause liquid freon to return to the compressor slugging the compressor that's when the compressor trys to compress liquid freon which does not compress the compressor locks up and you might get to buy a new one if your talking the condenser coil the coil outside where the compressor is no air flow would cause high head pressures and a safety would shut down the compressor fins would have to be opened up both coils must have good air flow for heat exchange  Air conditioning Ocean thermal energy conversion Gas compressor Heat exchanger Axial compressor Turbocharger Refrigerator Carburetor Thermal power station Turbojet Jet engine Gas absorption refrigerator Turbofan Tesla coil Solar power Furnace Thermostat Pebble bed reactor Gas turbine Mattress Haloalkane Evaporation Supercharger Pneumatics Diving cylinder Transformer Space Shuttle external tank Centrifugal compressor Ammonia Bleed air Glossary of firefighting equipment Relay Internal combustion engine Phase (matter) Pratt & Whitney J58 HVAC Geothermal exchange heat pump Vacuum Two-stroke cycle Refrigerant Turbine Circuit breaker Space shuttle main engine Microphone Motor oil Brayton cycle SABRE Fossil fuel power plant Carbon dioxide Four-stroke cycle Mars Exploration Rover Breathing gas Hydrochloric acid Magnet Apollo 13 Solenoid Stirling engine Cray-1 Air gun Hydrogen economy Diesel engine Three Mile Island Superconductivity Explosive material Helium Dodge Neon Fluid pressure Casting Spark plug Computer cooling Swamp cooler Pulse jet engine Nuclear reactor Natural gas Heinkel He 100 Mercury arc valve Bong High-voltage hazards Diving air compressor Water (molecule) Glossary of firefighting terms Boiling water reactor Air pollution Hydrogen vehicle Cabin pressurization Steam engine Water vapor Nuclear power Diving suit Liquid breathing Internal ballistics Fire fighting Aerosol spray Volcano Powder metallurgy Brewery Soldering Oxyacetylene

hot water heater i am building a story home the builders want to place the hot water heater up in the attic i have had discussions with other builders and homeowners and they advise me to place the hot water heater in the garage where should a hot water heater be placed jnet since houses have become more energy efficient and sealed to prevent heat loss or entry plumbing codes have had to be adopted to protect the public there are locations that most codes now approve in the attic and in the garage if it is located in the garage the unit must be elevated above the floor whether it is gas or electric combustible fumes can build up in a sealed garage that could be ignited by an open flame or a spark from an electric model the attic is ok as long as there is ample combustion air available some of these newer houses have such tight construction that the new water heaters are having the pilot lights go out because of lack of air either location is good but as a service plumber i prefer a garage location for ease of removal when the unit needs to be replaced attic locations require me to take a helper along to aid in the removal thus raising the installation costs i hope this sheds some light so you can make a educated decision good luck  Thermostat Spark plug Furnace Water heater Autonomous building Fire fighting Thermal power station Internal combustion engine Solar power HVAC Diesel engine Fossil fuel power plant Glossary of firefighting terms Torpedo Hydrogen economy Wood fuel Model aircraft Natural gas Straw-bale construction Energy Domestic water system Energy development Jet engine Tesla coil Wankel engine Bungalow Bong E85 Kitchen Incandescent light bulb Renewable energy Chevrolet Corvair Wind power Refrigerator Electrical wiring Nuclear power Fuel injection Pebble bed reactor Radio controlled airplane Turbojet Hybrid vehicle Combustion Hot air balloon Diving suit Stirling engine Gas turbine Manitoba Hydro Air conditioning Carburetor Alcohol fuel Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Solar panel Steam engine Fire Glossary of firefighting equipment Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Lighting Biodiesel Firefighter Thermocouple Rocket fuel Toyota Prius Automobile Tire Environmental concerns with electricity generation Gas metal arc welding Samovar Spacecraft propulsion Town gas Gasoline Geodesic dome Space shuttle main engine Power station Glossary of wildland fire terms Stairway Apollo 13 Turbocharger Passive solar Arc welding Hydroelectricity McMansion The Brady Bunch Fan (implement) Dodge Neon Automobile emissions control

what is better metal tile roof or light weight tile roof my house has shake roof we plan to reroof this summer please let me know advantages and disadvantages of metal tile vs ceramic lieght weith tiles thanks there are clay concrete and wood cement fiber roof tiles but i am not familiar with ceramic unless you are referring to the ceramic granules that are used to surface some brands of metal tiles metal tiles are durable cost efficient and light weight the ones with the ceramic granules will reflect more heat than the crushed stone ones but the ceramic colors will fade more than the natural stone clay tiles are light weight and will last a lifetime unless broken from impact but you will pay dearly for the real clay clay is the color of the natural soil that is is made from so the color doesn't fade concrete is very heavy and is usually painted so the finish eventually weathers off and you see the typical gray concrete color coming through since the concrete is so heavy most structures require added support to firm up the roof deck there are lighter weight concrete tiles available but these are made with wood fiber filler and break very easily most structures will need framing support added for these also for the best price metal tile is a very good choice and most will have a manufacturers warranty for years  Roof Ceramics Seismic retrofit Pottery Casting Masonry Tile Straw-bale construction Pavement (material) Knife Plastic Aluminium Natural building Plaster Drill bit Upholstery Aggregate (composite) Architecture of the California missions Titanium Glass Wood Deck (ship) Asbestos Sewage treatment Wind turbine Basement Uranium Reinforced concrete Light-emitting diode Corrosion Kitchen Welding Lithium Autonomous building Bicycle frame Geodesic dome Silicon Anchor Golf club (equipment) Stucco Leather Concrete St Albans Cathedral Portland cement Graphite-reinforced plastic Japanese art Internal ballistics Cookware and bakeware Binoculars Construction Xanadu House Light-frame construction Suspension bridge Space Shuttle program Ra (board game) Opportunity rover Incandescent light bulb Epoxy Bicycle lighting Alcohol fuel Pebble bed reactor Drainage Solar cell Wayne Corporation Solar power satellite Alhambra Turbocharger Stereoscopy Inflation Passive solar Radio controlled airplane Cubic zirconia Fireplace Lighting Boat building Robot Master Dental brace Japanese architecture Fiberglass Inkjet printer Ship Furnace Microeconomics Carbon nanotube View camera Diamond Bong E85 Timber framing

mold is growing on the wall under my window air conditioner why and what should i do we usually run the window air conditioner only at night after we were gone for an especially humid weekend and thus obviously not using the air conditioner we came home and noticed that the inside wall underneath the air conditioner is bubbling out and growing orangish colored mold i don't know if it was there before the weekend or not i'm wondering if the air conditioner could be causing the mold or if it's another problem with the window or maybe even the crawl space in our basement that's kind of below that spot what should i do i love the use beach answers here's the deal beach is an effective way to remove and disinfect mold from the surface only people what about the inside of the wall mold can grow on the inside of the sheetrock in the insulation and on the wood framing most environmental professionals will tell you that mold growth is possible only when moisture is present and that if the moisture is eliminated the mold will go dormant however they will also likely recommend that the mold be completely removed the first thing that should be done is to stop the moisture problem hope this helps  Toxic mold Air conditioning Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Electrical wiring Straw-bale construction Insulation Water Wood Solar power Humidity Basement Hard disk Cheese Plastic Autonomous building Swimming Casting Home repair Houseplant Window Explosive material Fire fighting Xanadu House Polyethylene terephthalate Gypsy moth Lighting Hamster Bong HVAC Carnivorous plant Air-raid shelter Building material Ice Corrosion Thermal power station Glass Door Decompression sickness Bacteria Carbon dioxide Ultraviolet Polyurethane Groundwater STS-114 Urinary incontinence Swimming pool Mattress Molding (decorative) Diving suit Asbestos Lichen Timber framing Spark plug Air pollution Carpal tunnel syndrome Fast bowling Weather lore Eczema Desertification Crew Exploration Vehicle Food storage Strap-on dildo Opportunity rover Syphon Filter Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Fecal incontinence Motorcycle Upholstery Volleyball Sega Saturn Domestic rabbit Cell (biology) Auxin Pachypodium Decomposition Stoma Passive solar Windows XP Water vapor Wildfire Soap opera W.I.T.C.H.

where can i find a kitchen faucet to fit an old porcelain sink the old sink has three holes with the two outer ones six inches apart the new faucets seem to be designed for outside holes that are inches apart it would be very difficult to drill through the cast iron and porcelain porcelain sinks like that aren't available anymore and it is very nice so i want to keep it u can go to ur local lowes or home depot and buy urself a faucet yes standard faucets for the kitchen are on a inch centerset and for the bathroom sink they are a inch centerset but they also make what is called a widespread and a mini wide spread that is adjustable so go tell whereever u buy the faucet from that u need a inch centerset faucet and they will be able to get it without all that oprdering and waiting and please do not try to make new holes  Tap (valve) Kitchen Tire Sento Bidet The Brady Bunch Shotgun Floppy disk Mountain bike Washroom Mouse (computing) Billiards Japanese toilet Paper size Toilet Strap-on dildo Naval mine Cookware and bakeware Cruising (maritime) Golf club (equipment) Stairway Glass Plumbing fixture Toilet paper Transformer Hard disk Chair Scale model Violin Sundial Shell (projectile) Glider Menstrual cup Reflecting telescope Spark plug Terminal ballistics Kohler Company O scale 19-inch rack M16 (rifle) Flute Clarinet Springfield 1903 rifle Table saw Porcelain Passenger car Opportunity rover Parade (military) GunBound Torpedo View camera Drill bit sizes Flush toilet Gross domestic product Bass guitar Plane (tool) Brewery Ford FE engine Bullet Disc brake Tin whistle Wrench Humphrey Bogart Harvey Award Printed circuit board U.S. customary units Transistor Forge Compact audio cassette Western concert flute De Lorean DMC-12 Flintlock Punch card Headlight Jet engine Hockey rink Dishwasher Firearm Crown (dentistry) Retronym Electrical wiring Bassoon Casting Excavator Textile manufacturing Mossberg 500 Mercury 4 Dodge Neon Shaggy dog story Dual gauge Eyepiece Lionel Corporation Black hole Trombone Model aircraft Hogwarts Floor Directory Climbing equipment

help i am changing my dryer from a prong cord to a prong cord thought it would be easy but it seems there were only wires connected with the prong and the prong has black hot green ground white neutral and red hot the prong only has black red and white i only have places to hook the wires so what should i attach and where because the black and red are both hot and positive wires can i put them together help we figured it out actually the only reason i asked about connecting the two together is because i saw it as one of the answers on this site to another members question therefore saying that the question or i am dumb dumb dumb is really uncalled for the whole reason for this site is for people to ask questions they need the answers too if you notice i asked first before doing anything thank you all for your answers we hooked the red and black on either side of the white and then the green ground was hooked to the frame of the dryer as the instructions on the dryer stated have a great night i can not believe the idiots that answer questions when they have no clue about what they are answering a prone plug is not volt and not hooking the green wire up why bother to change the plug tape two wires together is not a good thing either the red and the black wires go to the outside terminals the center terminal will have a shiny or copper strip of metal attached to the chassis of the dryer remove this strip from terminal and put the white wire to the center terminal remove the strip of metal from the dryer chassis and put the green wire under this screw on the old three wire to the dryer if for any reason the wire connected to the center was to be damaged and lost connection the outer case of the dryer the door and everything else that you could touch could become live with volts this is the reason for the new codes that require a four prone four conductor plug  Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Spark plug BS 1363 Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Fuse (electrical) Electrical wiring Residual-current device Snooker Oscilloscope Ground and neutral Circuit design RS-232 Distribution board Rigging Ethernet Electrical wiring (UK) Telephone exchange Overhead lines Transformer Climbing equipment Wire wrap Universal Serial Bus Tesla coil Split phase High-voltage hazards Wire Black pepper Soldering Third rail Earring Vacuum tube Violin Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Ground (electricity) Alternating current Electricity meter Resistor Electricity distribution Enigma machine Harp Strap-on dildo Professional wrestling match types Radio controlled airplane Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Vehicle registration plate Tire Advanced Technology Attachment Lighting Drill bit Printed circuit board Atari 8-bit family Switch Textile manufacturing Power cable Floppy disk Casting Telephone switchboard D-subminiature Incandescent light bulb Overhead powerline Capacitor National Electrical Code (US) Conductor (material) Upholstery Computer bus Antenna (radio) 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Airport Glossary of climbing terms Sinclair ZX81 Mattress Comanche Earthing system Tobacco Knife German car number plates 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Rail terminology Nintendo GameCube Point-to-point construction Flag Prong Volt Naval mine Computer forensics Thermostat Boy's surface

how do i empty water from my immersion heater i wan't to change the element in my immersion heater the immersion heater is the tall round cylinder type with two mm pipes going in and out from the central heating and two mm pipes one on the side and one on the top the mm pipe on the side as a valve that i can turn and that turns off the supply to the hot taps immediatly but i can 't seem to emty the tank whenever i loosen the element water starts to come out and i feel as i let water out the tap the cylinder is just filling back up i assume the immersion heater is on the top of the tank st shut off the cold main coming in to the house gate valves like the one you turned off at the side of the cylinder are noted for not shutting off fully as they get limescaled over the yrs don't seal properly then open all hot taps in the house until they stop running afraid you'll loose what hot water you had then put an old towel round the top of the tank as most immersion heaters are not at the highest point on the tank a small amount of water will come out quite normal then take out replace with new one ps if water still comes out without stopping then your indirect tank itself is burst inside will need renewing don't touch your radiator bleed screws as someone suggested as they have nothing to do with your job in hand best of luck  Carburetor Thermal power station Thermostat Water heater Diesel engine Apollo 13 Fire fighting Solar power Autonomous building Glossary of firefighting equipment Furnace Diving regulator HVAC Rail terminology Tap (valve) Hydraulic machinery Steam engine Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Diving cylinder Newcomen steam engine Novelty (locomotive) Spark plug Siphon Dishwasher Radiator Vacuum tube Screw Two-stroke cycle Scuba set Ammunition Irrigation Rebreather Oxyacetylene Seismic retrofit Bong Renewable energy Sento Drill bit Sleeve valve Central heating Basement Canal lock Fossil fuel power plant Internal ballistics Internal combustion engine Flush toilet Armored Core Domestic water system Hot air balloon Nuclear power Chevrolet Corvair Fire hydrant Motor oil Poker jargon Glossary of firefighting terms Energy development Tank Stirling engine Apollo Command/Service Module Fuel injection Glossary of partner dance terms Boiler Solar panel Chevrolet Corvair engine Brewery Marine aquarium Portable stove Upholstery Fujian tea ceremony Diving Motorcycle Manifold vacuum Transformer Containment building Baptism Circuit breaker Incandescent light bulb Betting (poker) Dundas Square Ocean thermal energy conversion Washing machine Home repair Wrench Indianapolis 500 M16 (rifle) Plumbing fixture Three Mile Island Oxygen sensor Tire Hydropower Pebble bed reactor Transistor Thermocouple

does anyone know anything about electrical wiring in a home we own a fairly new home years old and several months ago the master bedroom lights all weren't working the outlets etc the other week i forgot about the outlets and plugged in a vacuum cleaner in the room and low and behold all the outlets started working again sadly yesterday when i got home they were out again and so i thought hmmm i wonder if i could bring it back sure enough i plugged in the vacuum cleaner and the electricity started working again but this time it only came back for no more than a minute ugh we bought this house thinking it was new and perfect boy have we been wrong please give me any info or thoughts that you have on this moronic problem hi lynn hope i can help yes electrical problems can be maddening unfortunately they can also be quite dangerous fire being one of the dangers if you have any doubts about whether or not you can handle the problem yourself please hire a licensed electrician to help i am not one nor do i work for any electrical concern but i have wired several of my own houses and have dealt with such homeowner problems for over forty years that said let's see if i can help you locate and fix the problem form the descriptiion of your actions i suspect that one of the wires probaly a white one has come loose inside the box that that holds the recepticle you plugged your vacuum into there could be several sets of wires behind the actual plug in in that box each set is tied together with a plastic twist on gadget called a wire nut chances are that one or more of the wires have come loose to check it you first will have to go to your main electric panel and flip off the circuit breaker that feeds electridity to the set of outlets where the trouble is located if you can't find it you should get a neighbor of friend to help reaching into the outlet box without the breaker being off could lead to electrical shock and or a damaging short circuit okay assuming you have switched the correct breaker to the off position you can now handle the wires behind the outlet where the trouble seems to be located check the wires that enter each of the wire nuts white wires go together with the exposed copper tip of each touching the others the wire nut is designed to make that happen it just trwists on the black wires do the same but these are the hot ones be careful the green ones twist onto a bare copper one they are safe do not connect unmatching colors to each other if you find what looks like might have fixed the problem put the socket back in leave the cover off and switch the electricity back on at the breaker panel next check to see if the circuit works by plugging in a lamp or some other appliance if it still does not work do the drill again with the next non working plug in good luck and once again if you do not feel competent to attempt this get some professional help one source might be the builder who built the house he might me interested in seeing what the sub contractor who did the wiring did wrong cheers del  Residual-current device BS 1363 Fuse (electrical) Electrical wiring (UK) Poker jargon Distribution board Spark plug Vacuum tube Electrical wiring Electrician Light switch Switch Printed circuit board Thermal power station Incandescent light bulb Fan (implement) Electric motor Circuit breaker Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Solar power Three-phase electric power Solar cell Ring circuit Lighting Telephone exchange Oscilloscope National Electrical Code (US) Ground and neutral Transformer Gas metal arc welding Tesla coil Fluorescent lamp Mattress Circuit design Fire alarm control panel Drill bit Universal Serial Bus Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Jack plug Futurama (TV series - season 5) Ethernet Power strip Ignition system Rail terminology Cathode ray tube Internal ballistics Big Brother (USA TV series) Welding Soldering Knife Apollo Guidance Computer Scientology beliefs and practices Integrated circuit Professional wrestling slang Electrophysiology Kitchen Battery (electricity) Transistor Enigma machine New York Giants Lightning rod Mains electricity Debugging Nuclear power Tire Professional wrestling throws Thermostat Light-emitting diode Strap-on dildo Vacuum Alternating current Floppy disk Space disaster Fireworks X10 (industry standard) Terminal ballistics Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Electrical engineering Vacuum cleaner Dimmer D-subminiature Burglar alarm Jumpstart 3rd Grade Heinkel He 112 Digital circuit The Apprentice 2 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Screw Aluminium Christmas tree

craftsman lawn mower wont restart my neighbor has a craftsman lawn mower with power driven front tires hp motor if i remember correctly aprox years old if it is cold starts great and runs great but if you stop and try to restart it then you can not get it to start any advise this sounds like a typical ignition module problem to me next time he mows have him run it until it gets hot min and then shut it off take out the spark plug and reconnect it to its wire and hold it against the engine block make sure you are not touching the plug itself or you may get a little zap then you'll know for sure if its working or not have him pull the motor over as if he was going to start it while you look at the plug to see if it sparks if it does not spark then it is a bad ignition module since it works cold you can be assured that it is not the ground wire write the model type and code of the motor down and look up the part on the internet or have a small engine shop look it up for you then replace the module which is located under all of the plastic and metal gaurds it is a u shaped piece next to the flywheel you will have to disconnect the ground wire from the old one and reconnect it to the new one you can set the gap between the ends of the module and the flywheel at with a feeler guage turn the flywheel by hand to make sure everything is ok and then put everything back together to test before putting it back together have a friend hold back the bail at the top of the handle to release the flywheel brake and lay the spark plug against the block as before spin the flywheel by hand as quick as you can and look for spark at the plug  Lawn mower Spark plug Motor oil Reading spark plugs for racing Carburetor Automobile self starter Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Motorcycle Tire Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Auto racing Hybrid vehicle Embedded system Electric motor Toyota Prius Briggs & Stratton Internal combustion engine Horsepower Floppy disk Dodge Neon IPod Radio controlled airplane Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Tractor Two-stroke cycle BS 1363 Combine harvester Model aircraft Universal Serial Bus Battery electric vehicle Torpedo Internal ballistics Ethernet Indianapolis 500 Ignition system Thermal power station Automobile Space disaster Roller coaster Commodore 64 Modem Jump start (vehicle) Aircraft engine controls Welding Rotary engine Lightning Steam engine Kart racing Electric vehicle Ford Ranger EV Top Fuel Spark gap Firearm Car handling Enigma machine Honda Prelude Elevator Dodge Charger Volleyball Ford Crown Victoria X10 (industry standard) Oscilloscope Stirling engine Violin Bicycle Laptop Apollo 13 Rail terminology Porsche 911 STS-61 TGV Flywheel energy storage Skateboarding trick Glossary of American football Thermostat Mattress Tesla coil Flywheel Harley-Davidson Drag racing BMW M5 Fuel injection E85 Continuously variable transmission Mower Residual-current device Fuse (electrical)

window a c loud squealing noise we have a large kenmore window a c in our living room it has worked fine over the past summers however a few days ago it started making a god awful squealing noise the unit fan still blows strong and still blows cold but the loud squealing noise in too much to deal with not to mention at night it is very loud and i know it must be echoing down the street and disturbing everyone around we try to turn it off when it starts making the noise but with temps pushing degrees and this being an older home it gets unbearably hot in the house the sound is similar to metal scraping on metal when you turn on the unit it might not make the sound but sometimes does for a while it will not but then it reappears it goes from a short scrape squeal every seconds or so to a constant one that just forces us to shut it off i would like it if someone could provide me with possible problems this may be and how hard or expensive it is to fix ps tried wd already didnt change anything hope you have some mechanical and electrical experience start by removing the cover and visualy looking for anything rubbing look close at both fan blades if you don't see anything turn the unit on fan and listen to try to locate the problem you probably have a fan blade rubbing may be a bad bearing on one or both sides of the fan motor could be something else too but the problems i mentioned are the most likely causes be aware that the capacitor s can deliver a nasty shock even when the unit is unplugged  Electric motor Jet engine Thermal power station Drill bit Axial compressor Sound effect Knife Explosive material Helicopter Gramophone record Loudspeaker Time Out of Mind Solar power Microphone Fan (implement) Nirvana (band) Internal ballistics Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Capacitor Circuit design Transformer Equine conformation Naval mine Propeller Mouse (computing) Roxette Carburetor Radar Babe Ruth Sound Rail tracks The Legend of Zelda series enemies Sub-Zero Combine (Half-Life 2) Jam (TV series) Bong Decibel Memorial Stadium, Clemson Movie projector Electronic amplifier Sin City Wind turbine Drag racing Gothic rock Piano Rose (Doctor Who) Hard disk Grunge music Indianapolis 500 Hearing impairment Lawn mower Action potential Electrophysiology KISS (band) Eggerland series Gilding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sound recording Alanis Morissette Heavy metal music John Cage Mercury Atlas 6 Turbofan Table saw Haloalkane Dishwasher Welding Professional wrestling slang PID controller Tesla coil Vacuum Prank flash The Ashlee Simpson Show Bicycle brake systems Judas Priest SR-71 Blackbird Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Wind power Motor oil Green Line (MBTA) Steam engine Acoustics Renewable energy Impedance matching Capacitor plague Sento Railgun Audiophile Full Metal Panic?

is there any good way to vinyl side over clap board siding although foam board insulation is an diy'ers commonly advised way to level a wall surface before installing vinyl siding recent discussions among installers has concluded that foil plastic board as well as styrofoam t g insulation nailed directly over a wood surface whether it is sheathing or wood siding without a proper vapor barrier causes the covered wood surface to deteriorate best method is to remove existing siding check all substrate for loose nailing and rotted wood and repair remove existing building paper and start over check all window and door areas for proper spline paper and tie in with tyvek typar vapor barrier be sure to tape all joints in vapor barrier before installing siding keep in mind that removing existing siding allows you to install all new trim and accessories without causing additional work to make window and door surfaces look natural when installing siding  Mattress Printed circuit board Upholstery Roof Window Drill bit Plastic Gramophone record Manicure Fire fighting Electrical wiring Insulation Spark plug Woodworking Vinyl roof Laser engraving Polystyrene Langstroth hive Casting Epoxy Screw Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Straw-bale construction Solar power Ultraviolet Radio controlled airplane Solar cell Thermal power station Glossary of firefighting terms Wood Bong Xanadu House Greenhouse effect Corrosion Knife Wire Siding Mouse (computing) Rail transport modelling Water vapor Stairway Natural building Drywall De Lorean DMC-12 Violin Explosive material Model aircraft Welding Computer virus Dishwasher Equine conformation Rail terminology Condom Climbing equipment Fire extinguisher Laserdisc ZX Spectrum Strap-on dildo Door Israeli West Bank barrier Mylar Timber framing Motorcycle helmet Foam IPod Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Carburetor Motor oil Deck (ship) Pottery Textile manufacturing Passenger car Water (molecule) Headlight Boat building Polyurethane Langmuir probe Stucco Semiconductor device St Albans Cathedral Mosaic Geodesic dome Surveillance STS-61 Asbestos STS-114 Xiangqi Nuclear weapon design Spline (mathematics) Coffee Horseshoe Glass Paper Scientology beliefs and practices Digital rights management Brewery Titanium Toilet paper Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)

how much would it probably cost to get our hvac cleaned out or should we try to do the cleaning ourselves it's a three bedroom house on a slab foundation built about years ago assume it has years of gunk and grime obstructing the air flow causing the air conditioning to be inefficient and underpowered assume the coolant is fine and give a ballpark estimate based on not needing anything but cleaning i assume condensation on the coil would attract the most gunk and grime over the years so that's probably what needs the most cleaning but how hard is it to even get to that to clean it your evaporator coil is probably the dirtiest it sits underneath your furnace there is sheet metal around it that you would have to take off to get at the coil then you can lightly brush and wipe it off be careful don't bend the fins if it's real dirty it will have to be removed and that will take a hvac tech could be to dollars  HVAC Mattress Air conditioning Brazing Thermal power station Carburetor Pottery E85 Soldering Nuclear fallout Heat exchanger Fossil fuel power plant Pebble bed reactor Knife Transformer Solar power Brewery Violin Tesla coil Dry cleaning Seismic retrofit STS-87 Dundas Square Motor oil Dodge Neon Drill bit Autonomous building Casting Bong Homer's Enemy Bass guitar Dam Tooth Sailing Engine cooling Swamp cooler Equine conformation Gold standard Vacuum Solar cell Brush Electrophysiology Jet engine Hard disk Vacuum tube Bulk vending Aerial (dance move) Coal Dishwashing World Columbian Exposition Nuclear power Floppy disk Microeconomics Baseball Ocean thermal energy conversion Lake Glass Gas tungsten arc welding Railgun Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Dairy Superconductivity Japanese tea ceremony Electromagnet Chernobyl accident Iron Asbestos Evaporation Steel mill Terminal ballistics Stove Central heating Manicure 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Thermostat First aid Terran (StarCraft) Cleanroom Heinkel He 100 Air pollution Oral sex Microphone Phase change heat pump Refrigerator Coil Woodworking Fluorescent lamp Capacitor plague Helium Humidifier Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Directed-energy weapon Gilding Japanese toilet Frank Grimes M16 (rifle) Spark plug

why would a spp hand start be used on an air conditioning unit i purchased a brand new home in december in august the upstairs air conditioning unit stopped working the tech came out and said there was a small leak that he could not visually see where all the freon had leaked out he said the leak was so small that he would have to use dye in order to locate it he did not fix the problem that day instead he put two units of freon in and used a hand start we have learned since then that putting freon in a unit that is leaking is against the law we also feel our unit was defective the moment it was installed we do have a five year warranty on the unit and are prepared to go to court if necessary i would appreciate anyone who is knowledgeable in this area to give us some feedback are we crazy to think we got a lemon how is it possible that a unit that is only a year and a half old need two units of freon and a spp hand start whatever that is please help we cannot afford to keep repairing this unit thanks it definitely should not have a freon leak if it is new it is legal to put freon in a unit that still has a leak as long as it does not take more than percent of the total charge of the unit to make it work per year a spp hard start is to help the compressor start this would only be used if there was some kind of compressor starting problem the unit being under warranty doesn't necessarily mean they have to replace it unless it cannot be repaired they can do whatever is necessary to repair it at no cost to you considering this unit is fairly new the leak is probably in the connections where the line sets connect to the condenser or evaporator  Cray-1 Haloalkane Thermal power station USS S-43 (SS-154) IPod Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Axial compressor Copyleft Tire Plame affair USS S-38 (SS-143) Extreme Programming Product liability Pebble bed reactor Dodge Neon USS S-36 (SS-141) R46 (New York City Subway car) Phase change heat pump Heinkel He 100 Refrigerator Gas compressor Toyota Prius Babylonian law STS-35 Mars Exploration Rover USS S-37 (SS-142) Trademark Carburetor Jet engine USS Wedderburn (DD-684) USS Trigger (SS-237) Mattress Public domain Microeconomics Windows XP Urinary incontinence Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Ocean thermal energy conversion Labor theory of value USS Tunny (SS-282) Thermostat Dairy USS S-30 (SS-135) Computer virus Welding Fecal incontinence Volleyball Mortgage Ammonia Frank Whittle STS-61 USS Yorktown (CV-10) Implied warranty 1957 World Series Refrigerant Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Turbocharger Water vapor Electrophysiology USS S-42 (SS-153) USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Atari 8-bit family Wood Land Rover Delta Air Lines Current teachings of Prem Rawat USS Seal (SS-183) Contract Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina 2000 Australian Grand Prix E85 Vacuum tube Loss leader USS Taylor (DD-468) USS Ammen (DD-527) USS Aylwin (DD-355) The Amber Spyglass Poker jargon Unemployment USS S-40 (SS-145) Copyright infringement of software Education in the United States Insurance Kitchen USS S-45 (SS-156) Annuity Motorcycle AMD Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 USS S-44 (SS-155) Wind power Illegal drug trade USS Ajax (AR-6) Violin Chu-Han contention Knife Intellectual property

is there any way to get my bathtub plug out hey everyone i have been trying to figure this out for the longest time our bathtub in the house is running very slow and we cant get in there to clean it out or anything because we have what looks like a built in metal plug stopper whatever its called all we can do is pop it up about a centimeter to let the water out but we cant actually remove it i have tried twisting it and pulling it every way i can think of is there anything that can be done hi cassien what you have is called a captive plug the reason you can't get it out is that it is retained by a nut underneath as you are turning the plug the nut is turning with it so you could carry on 'till domesday and nothing would happen you need to take off the side panel of the bath to get access to the waste pipe unscrew the trap remove the waste fitting complete replace it with a normal waste outlet normally inch half obtainable at places like b q or other diy stores watch your back when you are crawling under the bath good luck  Sento Domestic water system Spark plug Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Japanese toilet Tire Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Bong BS 1363 Textile manufacturing Carburetor Thermal power station Stairway Professional wrestling holds Reading spark plugs for racing Samovar Tag Butterfly stroke Tobacco Energy development Hamster Flush toilet Dairy Residual-current device Customs and etiquette of Japan Screw View camera Saw II Climbing equipment Ammunition Diving Poker jargon Punt (boat) Drill bit The Inside Universal Serial Bus Breaststroke Dialysis Basement Brazing Columbine High School massacre Enigma machine Plumbing fixture Kitchen Backstroke Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Toilet Masturbation Apollo Command/Service Module Drag racing Irrigation Heinkel He 100 Earring Glossary of firefighting equipment Professional wrestling throws Firefighter Internal ballistics USB flash drive Caving Hydraulic machinery Carbon dioxide Dog agility Vacuum cleaner Solar cell Coriolis effect Distribution board Eifel Aqueduct Hard water Bathing Swingout Menstrual cup Novelty (locomotive) Fossil fuel power plant Computer virus Solar power S-mine Fast bowling Guqin Bathroom Computer forensics Glossary of climbing terms Bournemouth Membrane potential Sydney Harbour Bridge Comanche Rigging Fuse (electrical) Sewer Dundas Square Ethernet SCART Front crawl Futurama (TV series - season 5) Fountain pen Glacier Naval mine

roommate and air conditioning issues so my roommate and i are arguing over the temperature in our apartment i think is more efficient to have the apartment set a one temp and never change it she insists that we have at when we are there pm am and then turn it up to when we aren't there am pm i need help and how to explain to here what is the best way to save some money oh i forgot to say that we live in georgia so the temp outside is not the coolest of the temperatures i have heard that old wives tale before that it will consume more energy if you keep the house at a higher temperature while you are gone the enegy required to keep a room at a certain temperature is related to the difference between the inside and outside temperatures and the amount of time the difference is forced to exist by heating or cooling so the most enegy efficient temperature at all times is to keep the house as close to the outdoortemperature as you can reasonably tolerate in my opinion you could get used to c while you are there and turn the air off while you are out if you don't have pets another option is to get a programmable thermostat with a timer so when you get home the house is already comfortable when i lived in miami most folks kept the air conditioner at c when at home depending on different costs for electricity at different hours your electric bill may not reflect the energy savings too clearly  Temperature Energy development Thermostat Heat Turbocharger Autonomous building Welding Wind power Transformer Nuclear power Air conditioning Embedded system Internal combustion engine Energy Incandescent light bulb HVAC Renewable energy Jet engine Furnace Solar cell Refrigerator Water vapor Nuclear fusion Hydrogen economy Spacecraft propulsion Lighting Axial compressor Pebble bed reactor Hydropower Inflation Thermoregulation Alcohol fuel Carburetor Fuel injection Fire fighting Water (molecule) Resistor Superconductivity Peltier-Seebeck effect Sun Battery (electricity) Phase (matter) Fuel cell Urban heat island Deep lake water cooling Daylight saving time Optical fiber Nuclear weapon design Laser Solar sail Apollo 13 Hot air balloon Thermal power station Diesel engine Entropy MOSFET Climate change Future energy development Economy of Russia Phase change heat pump Circuit design Thermodynamics Ceramics Nuclear reactor Phase transition Environmental concerns with electricity generation Swamp cooler Fusion power E85 Global warming Internal ballistics Fossil fuel power plant Vacuum tube Turbofan Climate of the United Kingdom Diode Wind turbine Labor theory of value Sauna Water Spark plug Polyethylene terephthalate Motor oil Global climate model Gasification Nuclear power phase-out Toyota Prius Electrical wiring Ironing SR-71 Blackbird Dairy Turbojet Steam engine

edward humphrey wants to know can i use steel roofing on an older house edward humphrey wants to know can i use steel roofing on an older house steel roofing is a very logical option when considering replacing a residential roof keep in mind that in addition to the cost of the actual metal roofing panel most likely in order to qualify for the warranties associated with these products you must also use their accessories and adhere strictly to their installation instructions if you have a very cut up house lots of dormers and valleys etc the costs to waterproof these areas before installing can get to be costly but as far as a straight forward reroof over existing substrate costs are very competitive as much as i see a lot recommend going over existing shingles i prefer to strip the existing shingles and check the sheathing before waterproofing and roof installation  Roof Light-frame construction Vinyl roof Geodesic dome Electrical wiring Hubert H.

how do i maintain an adt house alarm my mother has just moved into a bungalow fitted with an adt alarm installed by a previous occupant who never used it it appears to be fairly new she called in adt to remove a detector form the kitchen so the dog may sleep there and install a panic alarm however when the surveyor called he said that adt would charge to per month to maintain the alarm she had an alarm in her previous property that was checked once a year at a cost of c are there companies in the essex area that will check and make adjustments to an adt alarm without my mother signing up to an expensive long term cvontract i note from your previous questions that your mother is elderly i would make an approach to your local police crime prevention officer and perhaps also to a local office of age concern they may have some useful advice on reputable alarm locksmiths in your area many alarms are totally unsuitable and just too sophisticated for elderly people for a variety of reasons the complexity of codes the time delays the key pads etc you can get large button size pads for example i do not know the details of the adt product but lots of alarms that have or require an angineer monitoring call out to reset them are capable of being programmed to be reset by a householder them selves in this case by you on your mothers behalf depending upon how technical you are if you can get hold of the installation book it might tell you how to get back to the factory default settings and you can follow the re programming instructions yourself i will not tell you how on this open site if need be a once and for all payment might enable an alarm fitter to use the existing sensors etc and fit a new more appropriate control box and key pad there are sensors on the market that are pet friendly they are set depending upon the height and weight of the dog so that they do not activate when the animals move around but still activate when an intruder enters this is useful as the dog can move around as freely as you want acting as another deterent there is some benefit in monitoring for elderley but it comes at a cost perhaps it would be worth asking about a 'red alert' panic button which people can wear round their neck and press for assistance this works via your phone and is useful if people are prone to illness emergencies do not underestimate the simple benefits of a door chain and persuading your mother to use it properly when i say properly a door chain should not normally be left on all the time as if it were an extra door lock instead it should be put on before opening the door fully to calllers it shouldn't be left on othertimes or at night because in an emergency helpers will be hindered in gaining access in some areas the local authority will maintain a register of key holders to record your details for a call out police forces nowadays do not routinely respond to house alarms without additional evidence of a crime in progress hence the selling point for the monitoring companies but you can get systems that will dial a phone number eg yourself or friend when activated and also ones where you can dial into your own home and listen in for any unauthorised presence  Fire alarm control panel Elevator Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Windows XP Mouse (computing) UK telephone numbering plan Combine (Half-Life 2) RFID Telephone numbering plan Microeconomics Traffic light Atari 8-bit family Trademark Embedded system Password Daylight saving time Surveillance RISC Computer CPU cache Palm OS Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Tax GSM services Insurance STS-61 Commodore 128 Phreaking Floppy disk Carburetor Public domain Annuity Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Expert system Credit card Glossary of firefighting equipment Urinary incontinence Cheating in Counter-Strike United Kingdom corporation tax Windows 2000 Compiler optimization Copyright North American Numbering Plan Public-key cryptography Columbine High School massacre Oscilloscope Mach kernel X86 assembly language Pretty Good Privacy Dog System/36 Closed-circuit television Information Technology Infrastructure Library Global Positioning System CPU design Automatic number plate recognition Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Drill bit Residual-current device Skype Telephone tapping Unemployment Donald Neilson Weight training Digital photography Enterprise content management C plus plus Hash table Lock picking Visual Basic Euro Crime prevention through environmental design Japanese toilet IPod Free trade Apollo Guidance Computer Gmail Medicine Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Bluetooth Password cracking Information Services Procurement Library Mattress Copy protection Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Nuclear proliferation Colony in Space Chess terminology Violin

inside coil and outside compressor for ton central air how important is it to replace the inside coil so that it matches the new outside coil i know you are supposed to do it to ensure maximum efficiency but if you have a unit installed outside that closely matches up with the coil inside wouldn't it still work well i'd hate to have to drop big bucks to replace both units especially seeing as how the inside unit is fairly new can't i just replace the outside compressor i was thinking of replacing the compressor i'm not planning to live here the rest of my life so i'm not that interested in the long term in years i'll be gone i hate to be that way but i just can't drop on a full new system right now so i'm just trying to get some info before the guy gets here to give me an estimate i'll continue researching and awaiting more answers great answers so far i replaced my compressor three years before i replaced the evaporator coils inside the house it is not necessary to do both at the same time the only issue you might have is when the inside evaporator coil fails you will lose the freon charge when this happens you need to immediately shut off the ac unit so that you don't damage the compressor the good news is that the coils don't fail rapidly so you will see some under performance in the unit before the charge gets too low plus an annual check on your freon charge will tell you the status one other thing to remember ac repairman are only slightly more reputable than use car salesmen be sure to find a reputable ac guy to do your repair  Air conditioning Heinkel He 100 Refrigerator Jet engine Thermal power station Axial compressor Carburetor Turbocharger Mars Exploration Rover Ocean thermal energy conversion Tesla coil Phase change heat pump Spark plug Toyota Prius SR-71 Blackbird Haloalkane Poker jargon Turbojet Pebble bed reactor Nuclear power Electric motor Mattress Turbofan Thermostat Diving cylinder Ozone depletion Cray-1 Equine conformation Directed-energy weapon Relay Ozone hole Incandescent light bulb Fire fighting Internal ballistics USS Trigger (SS-237) Transformer Mutual fund Dodge Neon Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Married... with Children Boeing 787 Particle accelerator Computer numbering formats Black hole Hard disk Supercharger Bass guitar Windows 2000 Gas compressor USS Vestal (AR-4) Loudspeaker Annuity Extreme Programming Wind power Supersonic transport Solar power CPU cache Embedded system Explosive material Diode Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Fuel injection Panama Canal Economy of Russia Wind turbine Vacuum USS Yorktown (CV-5) Tank Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 2005 United States Grand Prix Frank Whittle Terran (StarCraft) Kasparov versus The World Swamp cooler Killian documents Wardenclyffe Tower Metrovick F.2 Futurama (TV series - season 4) Social rule Bicycle lighting Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Theory of conduct Centrifugal compressor Space Shuttle program Dog agility Opportunity rover Pretty Good Privacy DVD Diesel engine ELO rating system F-14 Tomcat Gas turbine Magnetic cartridge Alcohol fuel Columbine High School massacre Iowa class battleship Spacecraft propulsion Hydrogen economy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode)

is it normal for ac vents to have mildew inside of them i moved into a house months ago and from the time i moved in i could see black mildew and wetness inside of the vents when i look into them i told my landlord about it and she didn't have much to say about it trying to save money i think is this normal i don't think it is i need to know because my mos old son is always fighting respiratory infections and i'm thinking this might be why your ac system is supposed to remove moisture from the air in cooling mode so no it would not be normal cool dry air usually prevents mold there is something definately wrong and as stated above many types of mold are bad  Casting Diving suit Polyethylene terephthalate Toxic mold Air conditioning Thermal power station Wheat Upholstery Swamp cooler Futurama (TV series - season 5) Sand casting Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Carbon dioxide Precipitation (meteorology) Psoriasis The Inside Biblical scientific foresight Legionellosis Weather lore Crucible Comfrey Autonomous building Rebreather Air pollution Fancy rat Thermostat K__ppen climate classification Three Mile Island El Ni__o Hamster Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dymaxion house Chocolate Climate of the United Kingdom Computer virus Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Theory of conduct Transformer Solar power Sulfur M16 (rifle) Hard disk Fire fighting Mount Pinatubo Sake Internal combustion engine Acute respiratory distress syndrome Otitis externa Heinkel He 100 Typewriter Monsoon Tire Ammonia Domestic rabbit Plant breeding Ozone depletion HVAC Botulism Electrical wiring Armored Core Atari 8-bit family Asbestos Blood transfusion Liquid breathing Xanadu House Straw-bale construction MOS Technology 6502 Carburetor One Piece minor characters Volcanic ash Thunderstorm Fast bowling The Apprentice 2 Density Estoppel Ozone hole Anticyclone Hypothermia Breath of Fire III Pneumonia Eczema Dry cleaning Pulmonary alveolus Cruising (maritime) Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Hip hop collaborations Advance Wars: Dual Strike Mummy Bullet Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Fire extinguisher The Long Game Refrigerator Desert Social rule Hemp Garden Strawberry Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Nuclear reactor

what should i use to strip paint on a year old brick basement wall the basement walls are composed of brick and i think it would take far too long basement sq ft and possibly damage the walls if i used a paint stripper the basement is unfinished there are several options a chemical stripper citrus strip works well and is safe scrape and sand if you are re painting all you have to is remove the loose paint sand blast you can rent a sand blaster at a equipment rental shop it is messy but it is fast instead of removing it if it is sound paint over it get a nice brick red paint to simulate the brick finish if you would like you could sponge a accent over the top to make it look like a brick finish faux finish  Basement Drill bit Arlington House Striptease Masonry The Wall Casting Gansu Air-raid shelter Star Wars: Battlefront II Seismic retrofit Adobe Table tennis Super Mario 64 Sewage treatment Explosive material Leather Fire fighting Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area Kremlin towers Titanium Combine (Half-Life 2) Paint World Trade Center Floppy disk Poker jargon Stucco The Jim Rome Show Springfield 1903 rifle Arcade cabinet Hi-Fi Murders Volleyball R-Type Washroom Star Wars: Battlefront Animal Crossing Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance Robotica Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Bassoon Surface mining Mies Torquay United F.C.

mouse mouse i woke up this morning and there was a mouse sitting to the right of me then it ran into my closet i ran to my sisters room to tell her theres a mouse in my room and we checked around my closet and couldn't find it she didnt believe me then we were in our parents room and my sister screamed because a mouse ran out of my parents closet and then back into their closet my mom said she saw the mouse in the kitchen this morning i dont think these are seperate mice i think they're the same one we've set up traps all over the house but cant catch it we have the electronic ones with peanut butter and the normal ones we have like i cant get a cat because im allergic what do we do the mouse doesn't like peanut butter it sticks to the roof of his her mouth and he she cannot eat for days until the stickiness is gone mice these days have grown smarter they don't eat fattening foods like cheese anymore because they know that once they get plump they are bigger more tempting targets for predators such as owls cats and humans they are also very observant and aware that human's tend to use cheese as bait so they know not to go near cheese and the accompanying mouse trap of death it would be best to get a professional to catch the mouse because it could spread germs and who knows what kind of rabies diseases etc in the meantime keep your closets and rooms clean because they love to hide in clutter if you smell something stinky or notice droppings most likely they are nearby i would try using sweet foods on the mouse trap instead of salty or sticky ones maybe the mice these days have changed their preferences and like not so sticky sugar filled candy or cookies good luck  Peanut butter Hamster Breakfast The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Garfield Cat Tooth Japanese cuisine Cheese Food Shaggy dog story Peanut The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Fancy rat Cuisine of Denmark Tofu Toilet humour Ed, Edd n Eddy Shen Gong Wu Chicken Kenny McCormick Fecal incontinence Ferret Recurring South Park characters Dairy The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Mouse Vegetarianism Animal Codename: Kids Next Door Butter Trailer Park Boys Chocolate Mouse (computing) Hey Arnold!

should i lubricate the chain on my garage door opener i recently installed a new craftsman hp garage door opener the maintenace section of the manual says to periodically lube the door hinges but says nothing about the chain is this an oversight if not what should i use is wd acceptable ok here is the gold answer no do not lube the chain reason being it doesn't need to be for one when you lube the chain it will eventually drip on your door leaving a perfectly straight line down the center of your door unless of course you want a black line on your door for two unless you have water standing or dripping in your garage the chain is pre oiled at the factory and doesn't require any more third and final is when you use oh lets say white lithium grease when the repair man being me gets kinda irritated because now he has to wipe all that off yes you do want to lube your door rollers hinges bearings springs for this use a spray lube with a silicone in it wd will do the job but it is not a lubricant it is a penetrant so it dries things out if you use a good lube once a year will do just fine any further 's e mail me  Lubricant Strap-on dildo Thermal power station Grease (lubricant) Personal lubricant Manual transmission Fire extinguisher Drill bit USS Swordfish (SSN-579) Irrigation Lithium Cruising (maritime) Menstrual cup Anchor Door Colony in Space Two-stroke cycle Biodiesel Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Jam (TV series) Coffee Carburetor Glossary of firefighting equipment Eastern Orthodox Church Roller chain Friction USS S-38 (SS-143) Oral sex Drip irrigation Shaving Wire Chainsaw Fire fighting Code: Lyoko Blood Simple Anal sex Seismic retrofit Ford Mustang Printmaking Air-raid shelter Glossary of nautical terms Intravenous therapy Seismometer Nuclear weapon design Radio controlled airplane The Champions Nuclear power Internal ballistics Bipolar disorder Filling station Monty Hall problem Traffic light Avenue Q USS S-36 (SS-141) Outpost 2 Burning Man Wood Windows XP Drag racing Wood carving Airbag Bicycle chain Upholstery Copyleft Violin Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Edsel Chico and the Man Babbitt metal Turbocharger De Lorean DMC-12 Textile manufacturing Alkane Phil of the Future Floppy disk Volleyball Heinkel He 100 Bladderwort Volkswagen Type 2 Mercedes-Benz 300SL Bay Area Rapid Transit Revolving door Masturbation Glossary of firefighting terms Galileo spacecraft Lionel Corporation Chess terminology Hair conditioner Great Pyramid of Giza Molybdenum disulfide CatDog Dishwasher Wayne Corporation Siphon SS Morro Castle Seinfeld Moisturizer Muslim ibn Aqeel
