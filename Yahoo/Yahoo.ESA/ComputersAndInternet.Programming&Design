ciw ido course hi i am thinking if taking this cousre as i want to learn about web design i have made websites on yahoo site builder my question is is this a hard course and do you think it will benefit me um what department at what school what sort of features did you use on yahoo site builder my guess is if you can't realize these are essential elements to make the question meaningful the course will be challenging for you not bothering to spell your title and abusing ellipses don't bode well either perhaps an intro programming course or through philosophy or math dept a course on logic would be better to hone the underlying thinking skills  George Lakoff Mathematics Scientific method Deconstruction Intelligent design Eastern philosophy Education in Romania RISC Ellipsis Search engine optimization Logic Abstraction Epistemology Philosophy of mathematics Western philosophy Spanish verbs Al-Ghazali CPU design Frankfurt School Science Vishnu sahasranama Experiential education Philosophical skepticism Analytic philosophy The nature of God in Western theology The Apprentice 2 Scientology beliefs and practices Ido Object-oriented programming Economics Reason On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Extreme Programming Numerology BASIC programming language LaTeX Microprogram Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Website Stopping e-mail abuse Metaphysics Expert system Cyberspace Postmodernism Phillip E.

barcode functionality i have done some research on the internet and found several programs that will generate barcodes for the platform i plan to use net however i have some general questions about the entire process does my program create the numbers that appear on the barcode and then the barcode software draws the barcode or does the barcode software also generate the numbers does the scanner act like another input device on the computer for example is it hooked up by usb will it be picked up automatically like other plug n play objects how does the scanner read the bar code if the barcode generator software is not by the same vendor as the scanner any links suggestions ideas or anecdotes will be greatly appreciated barcode number ean or upc a as an example is given as an input to the barcode software that generates the image see here for example http www barcoderobot com yes usually scanner is plugged like a keyboard and also acts as one scanners and barcode generators are fully interoperable  Barcode Barcode reader Optical character recognition RFID ISBN Universal Serial Bus Image scanner Enterprise content management Computer Computer virus Apple Macintosh AmigaOS Machine vision Geographic information system Automated identification and data capture Musical Instrument Digital Interface Computer hardware Mouse (computing) X Window System Windows 2000 Common Unix Printing System Device driver Computer software Spyware Rootkit Atari 8-bit family Unicode CueCat Anti-virus software Windows API Game programmer Canadian postal code Atari ST Floppy disk C programming language CompactFlash Architecture of Windows 2000 Mobile phone Reverse engineering Personal computer Secure Digital card Booting Sun Microsystems Free software Fortran Wi-Fi PostScript Mozilla Firefox Unix Software engineering Python programming language Linux MSN Messenger Library (computer science) Central processing unit Computer bus Java programming language Linux kernel Ajax (programming) Software-defined radio OpenDocument Digital rights management Microsoft .NET Digital photography Windows Vista Sinclair ZX81 Database Object-oriented programming Phishing USB flash drive Telephone exchange Computer insecurity Magnetic resonance imaging Standard Template Library Software architecture Microcontroller Turing machine E-Reader CPU design Microsoft Mach kernel Debugging One-time pad Microsoft Windows RS-232 Compiler Apple II family Windows XP Port (computing) Embedded system Portable Document Format Pretty Good Privacy

how do i install python libraries i have an embedded linux device that is running an embedded version of python for it the scripts i'm trying to run work great on my computer but wont run on the embedded linux device i looked into the matter further and found that two modules i am using threading and signal are not included in the embedded version of python they are i think part of the standard python library how can i get these modules and install them separately i don't think i can put the standard python onto my embedded linux device the module threading is a module located in the lib directory standard installation you could try to place this file in corresponding location on your device signal is a built in module i suspect its platform dependent and maybe not yet implemented for your device if your platform is windows ce for example signal is not implement in the win ce version of python  Perl Linux kernel Java programming language PHP Windows 2000 Library (computer science) AmigaOS CPAN Symbian OS Microsoft Windows Hello world program Common Unix Printing System Berkeley Software Distribution Microsoft .NET Windows CE Bluetooth OS-9 Btrieve Kernel (computer science) Session Initiation Protocol GNOME FreeBSD OpenOffice.org Macromedia Flash Apache HTTP Server Rootkit Virtual memory Windows XP BASIC programming language Make Mach kernel Unix Forth programming language Linux distribution X Window System AS/400 Unicode Computer virus History of the graphical user interface OpenBSD Debian Visual Basic Game programming Scheme programming language Common Lisp Thread (computer science) Web application Operating system Musical Instrument Digital Interface DragonFly BSD Novell NetWare Concurrent Versions System USB flash drive Qt (toolkit) IPod MDAC Windows API PowerPC SQLite Windows Vista Universal Serial Bus Categorical list of programming languages LZMA Embedded system Portable Document Format Name mangling RPM Package Manager Cross-platform Emulator Windows 3.x GNU Gmail Mandriva Linux Comparison of file systems Commodore 64 Slackware File system Secure Shell Emacs Plan 9 (operating system) HyperCard Component Object Model GNU/Linux naming controversy Wine (software) Widget toolkit NTFS Virtual machine X10 (industry standard) Apple typography C programming language

windows wizardry shortcut to toggle audio settings i have a usb headset that i use for audio and i also have a standard external speaker configuration i'll use the external speakers if my roomates aren't home and i can be loud but i'll switch to the headphones when people want peace and quiet i toggle between the two by right clicking on the speaker icon in my systray selecting adjust audio properties selecting the audio tab changing the sound playback default device to the other configuration then clicking ok whew is there some way that i can have an icon on my desktop that does all of that automatically whenever it is double clicked a little batch file or executable that detects the current setting then applies the other many thanks i'm not aware of any utility that can do this you might be able to set up a script to toggle your registry settings directly but that would be a somewhat inelegant and messy solution i'd recommend downloading a freeware macro recorder like powerpro that will allow you to assign the entire sequence to hotkeys not quite what you asked for but handy none the less  Mouse (computing) Windows XP IPod Screenshot Mozilla Firefox Musical Instrument Digital Interface Macromedia Flash ITunes Bluetooth Windows 2000 Konqueror USB flash drive Windows Vista Floppy disk Xbox 360 Loudspeaker Universal Serial Bus Linux Sound recording Apple Computer Object Desktop Windows registry Gramophone record COMMAND.COM Double-click (computing) History of Microsoft Windows DVD Stardock LiteStep Blender (software) Disc jockey Common Unix Printing System Unicode Vorbis Headphones Compact audio cassette Windows 3.x Hard disk Digital audio workstation Opera (web browser) Emacs PHP MDAC Apple Macintosh P__li Digital camera Amstrad CPC Computer virus Taskbar History of the graphical user interface Tungsten Handheld Microphone Pretty Good Privacy Macintosh Finder International Phonetic Alphabet Hello world program Booting Mac OS X Original Amiga chipset Sound card Synthesizer Java programming language Secure Digital card Ethernet Multitrack recording Cheating in Counter-Strike Switch WordPerfect Voice over IP Digital rights management Mandriva Linux JavaScript Commodore 64 Control Panel (Windows) AppleScript Window Maker Stopping e-mail abuse QuickTime Television Scheme programming language X Window System Phonograph Apple typography Circuit breaker Microsoft Windows Internet Relay Chat Linux distribution VHS

visual basic pls help me im now learning visual basic pls tel d meaning of dim integer string boolen and how n when use of these hey ash the first answerer is correct those are the basic steps to learn in vb more for any program you write in vb you must bear in mind that vb holds data only during runtime so when you close the program all the data are lost a typical example is the calculator program that u find on your computer if u had to solve the ff eqn of x you enter the numbers one after the other but each time you press the sign key the numbers disappear but its stored temporarily somewhere to be used for the next number dim this is how dim variables work in vb variables are used to store values temporarily or throughout the runtime of the program dim myage as integer dim myname as string integer means a whole number value from eg myage string could be letters words or sentence usually enclosed with in most earlier versions of vb eg myname ash barbara boolean means true or false usually used to present the result of a conditional statement most times boolean value are used to represent properties of the vb form eg me enabled true chkbox checked false there are couple of books you could use that explains in the most simple way one of them is vb by mac graw hill or you use the help menu on the vb program with the msdn page more one thing about these variables is u loose them once u close the program take for example u make a program for a storekeeper the strekkeper enters the sold items the costs and enters the amount paid so that your programs calculates the balance and adds the items to a stock list all the items you enter during runtime is lost once you end the application special note u seems to ave a great desire learning vb anyway vb is one of the best programming langs aroung simply because it has a gui where u ca see what u are designing and just put some codes to it but microsoft has since dropped the idea of vb and made new programs such as vb and next visual studio net developed on the net framework these are exciting programs langs that u can learn and its full of new ad latest technologies of todays sotware environment if u're not yet too deep in vb i'll advise u to get up with visual studio net it comes with powerful tools such as classes oop object oriented programming integrable databases and oles to build from simple application to web interfaces and database apis i can help u with some articles and some programs including the msdn network where you can chat and get info from co software developers around you while building your own application my chat is prenticehalls yahoo co uk i can chat u up starting from am  Object-oriented programming Visual Basic .NET AppleScript Computer Library (computer science) C Sharp JavaScript Microsoft Datatype Windows 2000 Programming language Lisp programming language Windows API Hello world program Windows Vista Perl Common Lisp Polymorphism (computer science) WebObjects Windows XP Cocoa (API) Thread (computer science) Mac OS X Component Object Model ITunes Database XML Class (computer science) Emacs RISC Variable Expert system CPU design OpenOffice.org Linked list Lotus Notes Abstraction (computer science) PL/SQL HyperCard Windows registry Hash table SAS System Microsoft Jet Database Engine Pointer MUMPS Object-SQL mapping Prolog Computer virus ALGOL 68 Software engineering Tcl G__del's incompleteness theorem Mac OS X v10.4 Boolean datatype Visual C Plus Plus Scheme programming language JADE programming language Digital circuit MySQL Unicode X86 Ajax (programming) CPU cache OpenStep Compiler optimization Game programmer ASP.NET On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition AmigaOS Palm OS Embedded system Geographic information system Database management system Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Smalltalk System 7 (Macintosh) Eiffel programming language DBASE Common Unix Printing System Mach kernel

java dateformat getdateinstance does not handle eras bc ad if you use the localized formats created by dateformat getdateinstance they display bc dates as positive years without the bc ie indistinguishable from ad dates manually creating a simpledateformat for each locale and for each style just to add the era designator seems less than ideal does anyone have any suggestions or can anyone suggest sites where this problem has been discussed whether bc or bce or translated to something else per the locale should be handled by the localizing code the 'standard' localized formats supplied by dateformat getdateinstance apparently does not handle these without intervention for every possible combination of locale and style yielding bc dates displayed as if they were ad dates looks like no one was actually reading what you wrote they answer before they have read the whole question and so there answers are pointless sorry i don't know either  Unix time Unicode OpenDocument Windows 2000 Embedded system C programming language Objective-C Computer numbering formats Floppy disk Java programming language Lisp programming language Laserdisc Gregorian calendar Gmail XML Whose Line Is It Anyway?

how do i compile a program in java in a terminal linux i am working on a university machine through ssh i know they have a java compiler installed what is the the equilvance in java to g foo cpp o foo thanks also how would i compile a multi file program how would i create object files what are the basic arguments the compiler takes thanks compilation is done with the java compiler javac to compile a single file javac foo java this will create foo class and maybe additional class files if you use some advanced java features specifically inner classes java class files are more or less the equivalent of object files though they're java bytecode rather than the machine's native code to compile multiple files just list them on the command line as well javac foo java bar java or javac java there's no true java equivalent to o foo as java doesn't make executable programs from the os point of view you can package your classes up into an application archive that the java virtual machine will execute though once you have all your class files created you package them in a jar java archive with the jar command which takes the same arguments more or less as the unix tar command jar cvf myapp jar class note that the class package naming and directory structure must match if you place your classes in the package foo bar you'll want to create the jar so that it archives a directory foo which contains a directory bar which contains your classes if you need to see the common command line options for the java compiler see the documentation for the appropriate version execute java version to see which it is then go to java sun com or execute javac help for a brief overview  Java programming language Perl Lisp programming language Microsoft .NET Common Lisp Python programming language Library (computer science) Java platform Java virtual machine Smalltalk Comparison of generics to templates C plus plus AmigaOS Compiler Scheme programming language Macromedia Flash Objective-C Sun Microsystems Name mangling Forth programming language Linux Categorical list of programming languages Xcode AS/400 Ocaml Debian Tcl Emacs PHP OpenOffice.org Datatype JavaServer Pages Virtual machine GNOME Make Cross-platform C programming language HTML element Byte-code Polymorphism (computer science) Aspect-oriented programming Reflection (computer science) PaX Visual Basic MUMPS Spring operating system Objective Modula-2 Programming language Dylan programming language Variable NTFS Class (computer science) Bash Enterprise JavaBeans DIGITAL Command Language Plan 9 (operating system) File system XML Lotus Notes Common Unix Printing System Computer virus ZIP (file format) Namespace (computer science) OpenGL Associative array CPAN MVS Object-oriented programming C syntax JavaScript Windows XP JADE programming language Packages in Java Master Control Program Apache Ant Oracle database Thread (computer science) OpenStep Scripting language Compiler optimization Object lifetime Internet Relay Chat Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition Obfuscated code C Sharp Hello world program Indent style ALGOL 68 Perl 6 Mozilla Firefox RPM Package Manager Exception handling Tar (file format)

flip function in excel i have several columns of data with spacer columns in between specifically financial data from to right now it goes form to from left to right ascending i want to make it so it goes from to from left to right descending does anyone know of a function or a simple macro that would do this if i specify the range of the data will your macro work with merged cells this doesn't have any just wondering this would be a very handy feature and i'm surprised excel doesn't have this feature or i haven't found it in any obvious places there is no function to flip the columns but you can sort the columns in the desired left right order select your columns data sort options button bottom left pick sort left to right ok pick the row to sort by the row that has your years pick descending note that the spacer columns will sort all the way to the right and you will have to re insert them between the years one way around this is to have a sort row let's say row below the years which has the sort order and sort by that instead a b c d e f blank blank blank etc etc now if it were me i would probably just cut and paste the columns to where i wanted them select the column to move edit cut select column that should be after it insert cut cells good luck  Quicksort Flat file database Mouse (computing) Winning Streak Selection algorithm Insertion sort Punch card Sorting algorithm Halting problem On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Floppy disk Shell sort Trip distribution Visual Basic Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME HTML element ALGOL 68 Eight queens puzzle Sudoku Relational algebra Common Lisp Binary numeral system Turing machine Beatmania IIDX Array Macro Expert system Sega Saturn Linked list ARexx Join (SQL) Search engine optimization Microsoft Excel Matroid Napier's bones Hash table System/36 Lisp programming language Magic square EIA-708 Emacs Database Polyomino Windows Mobile Monty Hall problem DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX IPod Wario's Woods Danger Hiptop Curling Dance Dance Revolution CPU cache Burrows-Wheeler transform MUMPS Orthogonal matrix Computer virus Unit record equipment Manual transmission Scrabble C preprocessor Quake III Arena Transposition cipher Crossword Domain-specific programming language Autonomic nervous system International Phonetic Alphabet Genetic engineering Cheating in poker DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Determinant OpenOffice.org Hamming code Economics Macro photography WordStar System/34 AmigaOS C programming language Equine conformation Java Database Connectivity Aerial (dance move) HyperCard Mobile phone N-Gage Spreadsheet Red-black tree Copy protection Enterprise Objects Framework Wallpaper group Cell (biology) Billboard Hot 100 Genetic algorithm Strategic management Animal Crossing

future it skills in your opinion what will be the most in demand it skills in the next three or four years i'm thinking specifically of software engineering and programming skills right now java and sql seems to dominiate the marketplace what will happen in or years it seems that lately lots of writers have been bashing java some people seem to think that java has stagnated and that the hyper enthusiasts have left well the rest of us are just quietly coding on a platform that is more exciting than ever other technologies like ruby php net or ajax might get more hype and acclaim lately but hype aside java still produces the majority of innovation in the software profession you can get a sense of java's health by simply looking at how many projects are out there using java pop on over to sourceforge and look at the number of projects by language http sourceforge net softwaremap trove list php form cat certainly sourceforge is not the final measure but it's a reasonable reality check anyway you'll find java projects the most of any language that's more than php ruby and net c vb net combined because of its prominence java gets a lot of attention and with it much criticism some of it valid what many may not realize is that some big breakthroughs have arrived and that the java development landscape is solving important problems let's take a view of where java is going to go in the next year or two as these ideas gain traction the first big arena of innovation is the addition of scripting support some people rightly claim ruby or python is better the java for some tasks groovy and beanshell solve these same problems and will become a standard in the jsr sense part of the java stack each offers something better than standalone scripting both integrate into a truly mixed environment with compiled bytecode and interpreted scripts interoperating smoothly beanshell's syntax offers as little surprise as possible for the java developer and groovy gives a ruby like syntactic efficiency but can also be compiled to pure bytecode and reused seamlessly a big improvement over jruby or jython second the days of heavyweight frameworks are gone j ee style ejbs are out now the lightweight frameworks like hibernate spring and hivemind are the future of java the heavy struts of the past is being replaced with two new directions struts shale based on jsf and struts ti is a wholesale merge with webwork these projects share a common idea that the framework should stay out of the way of your object model ejb takes the same view a third major innovation where java leads is aspect oriented programming aop aop will unclutter your code by moving cross cutting concerns like logging and security to transparent method interceptors aspectj is the rolls royce for aop but spring has lightweight aop themes as does the new jboss fourth the php crowd had a legitimate gripe that banging out a simple web page took too much work if you were using jsp and struts but our templating solutions like velocity freemarker and now groovy don't make you choose between ultralight text generation and powerful mid tier solutions groovlets should make for some rapid servlet solutions for those people who really like php keep it java makes it the reference implementation for the new web scripting language bindings so you can do your web views in php and use java for model and controller finally java's traditional strength in the tools arena just keeps increasing eclipse is the best ide on the planet and it appears that eclipse has reached critical mass like ant and junit did in that people simply expect solutions that extend it eclipse's team coding capabilities for cvs and subversion via the subclipse plugin are first rate the refactoring and debugging support are top notch integration of standard tools like ant compilers junit and javadocs are about as good as you can imagine so perhaps the hyper enthusiasts have left and the buzzword mongers will proclaim that java is dead if java is dead it's only because it was laid to rest so that a better lighter more agile form of java could replace it so long live java  Scheme programming language OpenOffice.org

string manipulation you have to write a function whose prototype is given bellow this function will accept two char named subject and pattern for example subject abracadbra and pattern bca now it should check occurrences of all chars of string pattern in subject if any match occurs then it will remove that char from subject so finally as in our example at end subject rdr void fun char subject char pattern write your code here it should be an algorithm generic to all languages dont use any in built libraries this kind of question can be overcomplicated but here is a simple working solution include iostream h void fun char subject char pattern char o p bool remove for o subject o o remove false for p pattern p p if o p remove true if remove subject o subject ' ' void main char sub abracadabra char pat bca fun sub pat printf s sub explanation first pointers are passed into the function subject pattern first loop loops through each character in the subject by incrementing a pointer o until the terminating character is reached o stops when it sees the null terminator second loop loops through pattern checking if the contents at address o character in subject is same as contents at address p character in pattern if we find a match record it with a boolean once we finish the pattern loop we can start to change the subject string the function has been passed a pointer to subject so we know at the start subject subject if there is no match we can keep the character at o so set the contents of subject to o and increment its pointer note there are pointers going through subject one to read and one to write once we finish we make sure subject has a terminating character as all strings must have  C syntax ALGOL 68 Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm Linked list C plus plus Hello world program Buffer overflow Printf Associative array Cyclone programming language Objective-C String (computer science) Brainfuck Const correctness Python programming language Stack-smashing protection Virtual method table Icon programming language CPU cache Lisp programming language PHP Scheme programming language C Sharp Control flow Perl Callback (computer science) MUMPS Binary numeral system UTF-8 JavaScript Forth programming language Halting problem Garbage collection (computer science) Thread (computer science) AS/400 Command Language 0 (number) Motorola 68000 Polymorphism (computer science) Common Lisp Compiler optimization X86 assembly language Addressing mode Bogosort Exception handling Normal distribution Boolean datatype New I/O Comparison of generics to templates Lazy evaluation BASIC programming language Reference (computer science) Rabin-Karp string search algorithm Ocaml Java programming language Apollo Guidance Computer Pattern matching Reference counting Turing machine Tagged union Boolean logic Subroutine Dynamic-Link Library PDP-8 Class (computer science) Domain Name System LR parser Array Visitor pattern Tcl Boolean algebra Prolog Laws of Form Lambda calculus Quantum computer NP (complexity) Fortran Iterator Regular expression Enterprise content management Extreme Programming Berkeley sockets Indent style Fibonacci number Endianness Software testing Database management system Compiler Object-oriented programming Function object Merge algorithm

does anyone know of an image hosting site that could possibly does anyone know of an image hosting site that could convert a bmp file to a gif is there any way i can do that myself or do i have to download programs and stuff you can easily convert a bmp to a gif by just loading the file to convert in paint then go to file save as and now from the list of types to save as near the bottom of the popup save as screen choose gif have fun edit as a reply to the person talking about the gimp all programs will destroy colors when you save as a gif the reason for that is because in gif images you are only allowed to have colors in the picture but when you save as jpeg or png images it usually keeps the colors the way they were  GIF PNG PlayStation Portable ASCII art Image file formats Microsoft Paint Web page JPEG File format Screenshot Macromedia Flash IPod Lossless data compression Pixel art Wallpaper group Windows Picture and Fax Viewer Tux Paint ImageMagick Unicode Digital image editing QuickTime Atari 8-bit family Goatse.cx Favicon ITunes Prank flash JPEG 2000 Forth programming language Data compression Blue screen of death Mandelbrot set Lossy data compression IrfanView Flags of non-sovereign nations Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Windows bitmap Gallery of sovereign state coats of arms Adobe Photoshop Lemmings (computer game) GIMP President of the United States BZFlag Raw image format Vector graphics 2D computer graphics Iriver Common Unix Printing System Magic number (programming) Computer virus Emacs Commodore 64 Homestar Runner Super Nintendo Entertainment System OS/2 Graphics Knoppix Pop-up ad Comparison of layout engines (graphics) Pixel Gallery of flags by design Filename extension Tagged Image File Format Gnutella Ebook BitTorrent AmigaOS Traditional animation Web hosting Stereoscopy Windows XP Podcasting CITV 2006 Commonwealth Games Bulletin board system Web browser Pan-Slavic colours PlayStation 3 Steganography Opera (web browser) RGB color model Internet pornography Bally Astrocade Musical Instrument Digital Interface Cascading Style Sheets System/34 This Week in Tech Gmail Gallery of flags based on British ensigns Uploading and downloading Nintendo Entertainment System Game Boy Final Fantasy IV Fluorescent lamp Xbox 360 Teutonic Knights Web banner Handheld game console System/36

what is the form of sdlc stlc vss td lr sdlc software development life cycle stlc software testing life cycle vss visual source safe td test director lr load runner sdlc a software development process is a structure imposed on the development of a software product synonyms include software life cycle and software process there are several models for such processes each describing approaches to a variety of tasks or activities that take place during the process steps domain analysis often the first step in attempting to design a new piece of software whether it be an addition to an existing software a new application a new subsystem or a whole new system is what is generally referred to as domain analysis software elements analysis the most important task in creating a software product is extracting the requirements customers typically know what they want but not what software should do while incomplete ambiguous or contradictory requirements specification specification is the task of precisely describing the software to be written possibly in a rigorous way software architecture the architecture of a software system refers to an abstract representation of that system architecture is concerned with making sure the software system will meet the requirements of the product as well as ensuring that future requirements can be addressed implementation or coding reducing a design to code may be the most obvious part of the software engineering job but it is not necessarily the largest portion testing testing of parts of software especially where code by two different engineers must work together falls to the software engineer documentation an important and often overlooked task is documenting the internal design of software for the purpose of future maintenance and enhancement documentation is most important for external interfaces software training and support a large percentage of software projects fail because the developers fail to realize that it doesn't matter how much time and planning a development team puts into creating software if nobody in an organization ends up using it maintenance maintaining and enhancing software to cope with newly discovered problems or new requirements can take far more time than the initial development of the software stlc the testing life cycle can be broadly classified into three different life cycle models depending upon the type of application and the test strategy used such as application testing life cycle automation testing life cycle package testing life cycle vss microsoft visual sourcesafe vss is a source control software package oriented towards smaller software development projects advantages visual sourcesafe's advantages are relative ease of use and some degree of integration with other microsoft development solutions for small or medium scale development where multiple versions are not simultaneously supported its limitations do not cause major problems further strong points include its excellent integration with microsoft visual studio its easy to use interface and the fact that it is included as part of certain msdn subscriptions td testdirector is mercury interactive s software test management tool it helps quality assurance personnel plan and organize the testing process with testdirector you can create a database of manual and automated tests build test cycles run tests and report and track defects you can also create reports and graphs to help review the progress of planning tests running tests and tracking defects before a software release using testdirector we can define application requirements and testing objectives design test plans and develop test cases create automated scripts and store them in the repository run manual and automated tests report execution results enter defects review and fix defects by logging into the database using application status reports we can decide whether an application is ready to be released test director is a test management tool with which we can manage our entire testing process it is a central repository where we can store our requirements test plans test cases and tests scripts and execute the test cases and test scripts we can share the work with other qa testers using test director since it is a web based test management tool lr mercury loadrunner prevents costly performance problems in production by detecting bottlenecks before a new system or upgrade is deployed you can verify that new or upgraded applications will deliver intended business outcomes before go live preventing over spending on hardware and infrastructure it is the industry standard load testing solution for predicting system behavior and performance validation and the only integrated load testing tuning and diagnostics solution in the market today with loadrunner you can measure end to end performance diagnose application and system bottlenecks and load test applications that run in the context of remote desktop protocol rdp all from a single point of control it supports a wide range of enterprise environments including web services ajax j ee and net with loadrunner you can obtain an accurate picture of end to end system performance verify that new or upgraded applications meet specified performance requirements identify and eliminate performance bottlenecks during the development lifecycle reduce scripting time by percent loadrunner now includes game changing technology that reduces the script creation process down to a few simple mouse clicks hope this helps cheers

c for beginners describe the characteristics of an array declaration initialization etc and give code examples i really need help in this can someone help me out here c arrays are the data structures which can be used to store consecutive values of the same data types c arrays can be declared for all c data types viz int float double char struct char etc all the values are stored in consecutive memory locations the values can be accessed by using the position of the stored value the computer also stores c arrays in consecutive memory locations viz etc this makes the c arrays' accessibility faster unlike other data structures like linked list queue etc the access to the elements is very fast c arrays can be multi dimensional most cases a maximum of dimensions will suffice for programming that too single dimension c arrays are the commonest declaring c arrays of int type the c arrays are declared with the data type name and the number of elements inside the square brackets int var name c array of type int with maximum size the above declaration means the var name is an array of integer type the values inside this var name array can be accessed by referring to the position of their elements like var name var name etc all the c arrays are based on zero index values that means the position reference starts at and counts till the n th position so in the above array elements can be stored starting from to the maximum number of elements that can be stored or the maximum size of the c array is the values can be stored and accessed as given in the following code snippet var name var name var name printf position d position d position d n var name var name var name care should be taken while using or referring to the position of the element the position reference should not exceed the maximum size specified in the declaration if it exceeds the program will not generate any compiler errors but it will raise run time errors and exceptions declaration of a two dimensional array is also similar a great example for a two dimensional c integer array will be matrix int array matrix matrix of type using c array of int data type declaring c arrays of type float the declaration and use of c arrays in float type are the same as int the declaration is written as follows float var float a c array of float type the above declaration means the c float array contains elements starting from position till the elements can be accessed as var float var float var float var float var float var float var float declaring c arrays of type char this is one of the most widely used and problematic type of c array when an array of char is declared this char array can be used as a string with the maximum size as specified in the array declaration when this c char array is declared with two dimensions this can be thought as an array of strings char var char array memory reserved for characters char var char init c char array string example initialization without specifying the size like the above the c char array can be declared with or without initializing values c array advantages easier to declare and use can be used with all data types c array disadvantages fixed size data if the number of elements stored are less than the maximum size then the rest of the memory space goes waste if the number of elements to be stored are more than the maximum size the array cannot accommodate those new values  Chmod File system permissions File system File Allocation Table Tar (file format) Filename extension Logo programming language Emacs Ls Files-11 File format Comparison of file systems NTFS Computer file Cp (Unix) Common Unix Printing System Multics Master Control Program Macintosh Finder Symbolic link Newline 666 (number) Bash Tilde Unix security Library (computer science) Ocaml Unix shell Forth programming language Berkeley Software Distribution Mach kernel Windows 2000 Python programming language Internet Relay Chat Rootkit ISO 9660 Apollo Guidance Computer C programming language Vi Windows registry Unix File System Directory SCO v.

how can i change this so users can upload files to my site into a folder called uploads tr td input type file id myfile name myfile class maintxt size td td width td td td td input id upload a name upload a class maintxt type submit value upload td td td tr you can't directly get the client to specify a server directory because it can't see it the server script is responsible for saving the uploaded file into whatever directory it wants on the server you should make a directory if you haven't already called uploads and then change the script to save the uploaded file as uploads myfile value where myfile value is the value of the input with name myfile the script has to get hold of the filename from this anyway so previously if you were saving the file as myfile value that would save the file in the root directory of your server all you have to do is change the filename opened by the server script to uploads myfile value if you have several directories that you want the users to select from in some way you could choose to add a text input specifying which server directory to use but the script has to process that and use the info to save the uploaded file in the right directory hope that helps  Filename extension File format Hyperlink XHTML ASCII art Image file formats Uniform Resource Identifier Goatse.cx Prank flash Macromedia Flash Cascading Style Sheets Web page HTML scripting HTML JPEG Uniform Resource Locator Favicon GIF Common Unix Printing System Gmail Graphics Markup language Wallpaper group Logo programming language Hello world program Emacs PNG QuickTime Cross site scripting Lemmings (computer game) XML President of the United States Ajax (programming) AOL Instant Messenger Cue sheet Mandelbrot set Plain Old Documentation World Wide Web Pixel AmigaOS Gallery of sovereign state coats of arms Unicode Representational State Transfer International Phonetic Alphabet MIME Hyphen Gallery of flags by design Comparison of web browsers Portable Document Format Stopping e-mail abuse Wiki Milan Plain text Bad Religion All your base are belong to us Image Trojan horse (computing) HyperText Transfer Protocol Opera (web browser) Mozilla Application Suite Files-11 Bookmarklet P__li Ebook DOM Events B3ta EMule File system Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Gallery of flags based on British ensigns Comparison of layout engines (HTML) Personal computer game Whois Character encodings in HTML OmniWeb Blogger Flags of non-sovereign nations Resident Evil: Apocalypse Something Awful Forums ISO 9660 Namco x Capcom Stereoscopy MySpace LaTeX HTML editor Mozilla Firefox Computer file Mouse (computing) MSA-0011(Ext) Ex-S Gundam Filename Web bug Transclusion Animation Ext2 Internet phenomenon De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter Tilde Pacific Ten Conference

whats the best way to incorporate msacess and mysql designed a database that has or so records in a table that are being hosted on line and this information is being fed into a ms access database with cool user interfaces etc with obdc links etc it works ok and is reasonably fast in the map mouse clicking part but when i do more of a refined search for information it crashes and stops is it common practice to fill and empty a temporary msaccess db table with mysql data in this situation and run search queries off that while its updated or do can you query live data from msql with ms access very quickly and i'm doing it wrong thanks in advance you shouldn't need a temporary table to do a search if you have a table defined in access that is linked to a table in mysql you should just search the access table creating a temp table will use a lot of resources  HTTP cookie BitTorrent Apache HTTP Server Website Electronic commerce Streaming media HyperText Transfer Protocol Web hosting Uniform Resource Locator Windows Server 2003 JavaServer Pages Flickr Session Initiation Protocol Proxy server Server Web browser WebSphere Web server Windows XP Sun Microsystems Thin client Internet Lotus Notes Jakarta Tomcat MMORPG Apple Computer Windows 2000 Video game developer GameSpot Transport Layer Security Web crawler Internet fraud Web service WebDAV Computer Netscape Communications Corporation Network address translation User agent Wget Google Web Accelerator Real Time Streaming Protocol Peer-to-peer Squid cache World Wide Web E-mail spam Video game crash of 1983 MSN Messenger Freenet Virtual hosting Etisalat Webmail ROM image I2P Storage area network Internet pornography Representational State Transfer Application server Secure Shell File system IBM PC compatible XML Microsoft History of Microsoft Windows File Transfer Protocol Google PlayStation 3 Common Unix Printing System Web traffic Care Bears Gnutella Spyware Cross site scripting Network-attached storage Files-11 Denial-of-service attack Warez Nintendo GameCube Active Directory Sequent Computer Systems Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Ajax (programming) IPlanet Opera (web browser) Internet Information Services Transmission Control Protocol Port numbers IBM PC The Great Race (Care Bears) Base64 Mainframe computer Yahoo!

what is the best programs to make a rpg web based of course so yeah i cant download em cos they are always to big and i have slooooooooooooow net so ill just make one and i would like to make it d none of this stuff with no animation or n e thing lol haha yes indeedy i am a kid but excell in i t the teacher asks me for help ha yeah i pick up programs pretty quickly i may not pick up this program like that but over time i will lol ah well although i dont use techinical programs i still get asked for a lot of help flash power point mod editor thing for mount and blade if you know what that is and yeah he asked me for help in power point my teacher is a bit of a dumb ass lol any way i really want to try and make my own game and my friends think i can do it p you can use adobe flash to create web based games that incorporate stuff like shooting walking fighting killing yadadada dudadi bliblablu yagagabuahaha creating games in flash is so simple that its almost laughable of course there's a certain learning curve but if you are a quick learner ask for help at forums and read up a little you should master it in no time many people have said that flash actionscript is the baby of all programming languages and i absolutely agree another programming language that is web based is java but java is slooooowww realllllyyyyyy realllyyy slooooowww and that suckkksssss away all the fun anyway i absolutely hated runescape back to flash if you feel you are well versed enough in actionscript after creating a handful of games you can even try your hand at creating mmorpgs like club penguin via the xml flash socket servers like smartfoxserver electroserver oregano palabre unity server red or web based rpgs like adventure quest smartfoxserver and electroserver have example apps and extensive documentation and though the trial is free and not time limited it only allows up to concurrent connections the oregano server is free and open source so perhaps you could try looking into oregano if you are interested in making an mmorpg having played the mmorpg club penguin for a while has shown me that only the chat and movement around the map is sent from client to client much of these is relatively simple to do although you can consider making turn based games that do not need to take into account the server latency cpu delay and other things real time games on the other hand are much too complicated as there are many variables to look into anyway if you are able to code a chess game along with the ai tower defense game google desktop tower defense a simple connect four game a pool game like yahoo pool and have a good idea on oop concepts then you are on your way to scamming money out of people who will pay for the games you have created of course you can always consider the product newly marketed by microsoft silverlight termed the flash killer as it is also web based technology i do not know much of silverlight but you can do research on it and tell me alternatively you can also get gamemaker engine and create applications with a touch of your hand but i believe its not web based like flash or java http en wikipedia org wiki game maker edit sadly i have to concur with the guy above me you don't sound like you have a clue about what making games involve making something like starcraft or even a simple rpg like adventure quest is very difficult it is entirely possible that you would likely not enjoy playing the games you have made on your own and the process in making a good one would involve a lot of testing edit haha yes indeedy i am a kid but excell in i t the teacher asks me for help ha yeah i pick up programs pretty quickly i may not pick up this program like that but over time i will so what programs do you use anyway i can use microsoft word and excel and say i excel in it too edit good for you then seems to me like your friends have a lot of justified faith in you and perhaps you are on the way to becoming a renowned programmer maybe someone who can become our next bill gates but i still would like to ask you a question though are you good in mathematics its because many algorithms in gaming like pathfinding and collision utilises some mathematical concepts perhaps not exactly the advanced kind but its still better if you do have some form of expertise in it if you are good in it which i'm sure you are then you should have have no problems going far or making that game which you are so keen on  PHP MySQL Apache HTTP Server Ajax (programming) Web application Object-oriented programming CPAN BitTorrent

ideads ideas ideas hi guys im making a website which is about half finished it will be a an image hosting networking like myspace website and completely free but im sorta stuck with getting the design right just wanna know what people think i should change about this page www pic sure com index php any ideas would be great and much apreciated thannks everyone brody if u follow links you will find that pages are incomplete i love it however the flash box on the left needs a boarder it's way to hard on the eyes when it meets the rest of the site both home and feedback aren't centered have you also considered a small clip art type image near them it's a common design practice to put a copyright blah blah at the bottom so people know that's the bottom of your site you could really use this as your site kinda just drifts off the sides look kinda empty maybe some gradients a la torrentspy for the sides i do love it though i'm just being critical because you asked  File Transfer Protocol Uniform Resource Locator Wget Macromedia Flash Secure Shell HyperText Transfer Protocol PHP Transmission Control Protocol Transport Layer Security Computer security Novell NetWare MDAC Mach kernel Internet fraud Telnet Port numbers Internet Relay Chat Web hosting IRCHighway Concurrent Versions System Firewall (networking) Proxy server Virtual Network Computing Virtual hosting Internet Domain Name System OpenBSD Bounce (network) Load balancer Network address translation Danger Hiptop Internet Message Access Protocol GNU Hurd Kerberos (protocol) Windows XP Web browser Server Bluetooth Public key infrastructure GameFAQs Netfilter/iptables Squid cache Steam (content delivery) Ettercap (computing) 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines XML Sharp Zaurus Apple Filing Protocol Peer-to-peer Damn Small Linux WebObjects Warez Twisted Wi-Fi Protected Access CPAN Macromedia Website OpenOffice.org L4 microkernel family Pretty Good Privacy S/KEY SUSE Linux Opera (web browser) Btrieve Doom WAD Phishing Linspire Wikipedia Gmail Web design OpenSSH Java programming language Virtual private network Secure copy Friend-to-friend Doom ColdFusion Buffer overflow SAML Internet protocol suite Digest access authentication Active Directory Kazaa Topsite Information Technology Infrastructure Library Public-key cryptography Unix Linux Password cracking Post Office Protocol Spring operating system System/34 Windows Server 2003 Enterprise content management Web service World Wide Web Independent Media Center Malware

what is the latest programming language i need to make a written assingment on latest programming language who it'sdeveloper anyone know about it in broad strokes programming languages divide into programming paradigms and a classification by intended domain of use paradigms include procedural programming object oriented programming functional programming and logic programming some languages are hybrids of paradigms or multi paradigmatic an assembly language is not so much a paradigm as a direct model of an underlying machine architecture by purpose programming languages might be considered general purpose system programming languages scripting languages domain specific languages or concurrent distributed languages or a combination of these generations of programing languages the history of computer development is often referred to in reference to the different generations of computing devices each generation of computer is characterized by a major technological development that fundamentally changed the way computers operate resulting in increasingly smaller cheaper more powerful and more efficient and reliable devices read about each generation and the developments that led to the current devices that we use today first generation vacuum tubes the first computers used vacuum tubes for circuitry and magnetic drums for memory and were often enormous taking up entire rooms they were very expensive to operate and in addition to using a great deal of electricity generated a lot of heat which was often the cause of malfunctions first generation computers relied on machine language to perform operations and they could only solve one problem at a time input was based on punched cards and paper tape and output was displayed on printouts the univac and eniac computers are examples of first generation computing devices the univac was the first commercial computer delivered to a business client the u s census bureau in second generation transistors transistors replaced vacuum tubes and ushered in the second generation of computers the transistor was invented in but did not see widespread use in computers until the late s the transistor was far superior to the vacuum tube allowing computers to become smaller faster cheaper more energy efficient and more reliable than their first generation predecessors though the transistor still generated a great deal of heat that subjected the computer to damage it was a vast improvement over the vacuum tube second generation computers still relied on punched cards for input and printouts for output second generation computers moved from cryptic binary machine language to symbolic or assembly languages which allowed programmers to specify instructions in words high level programming languages were also being developed at this time such as early versions of cobol and fortran these were also the first computers that stored their instructions in their memory which moved from a magnetic drum to magnetic core technology the first computers of this generation were developed for the atomic energy industry third generation integrated circuits the development of the integrated circuit was the hallmark of the third generation of computers transistors were miniaturized and placed on silicon chips called semiconductors which drastically increased the speed and efficiency of computers instead of punched cards and printouts users interacted with third generation computers through keyboards and monitors and interfaced with an operating system which allowed the device to run many different applications at one time with a central program that monitored the memory computers for the first time became accessible to a mass audience because they were smaller and cheaper than their predecessors fourth generation present microprocessors the microprocessor brought the fourth generation of computers as thousands of integrated circuits were built onto a single silicon chip what in the first generation filled an entire room could now fit in the palm of the hand the intel chip developed in located all the components of the computer from the central processing unit and memory to input output controls on a single chip in ibm introduced its first computer for the home user and in apple introduced the macintosh microprocessors also moved out of the realm of desktop computers and into many areas of life as more and more everyday products began to use microprocessors as these small computers became more powerful they could be linked together to form networks which eventually led to the development of the internet fourth generation computers also saw the development of guis the mouse and handheld devices fifth generation present and beyond artificial intelligence fifth generation computing devices based on artificial intelligence are still in development though there are some applications such as voice recognition that are being used today the use of parallel processing and superconductors is helping to make artificial intelligence a reality quantum computation and molecular and nanotechnology will radically change the face of computers in years to come the goal of fifth generation computing is to develop devices that respond to natural language input and are capable of learning and self organization hope this will solve

what is the best site to learn c with no prior experience in programming i am very new to the whole programming game i bought a book not to long ago called c without fear but i am having a hard time reading what this guy writes half the time i have also been to teach yourself c in days but again this website assumes too much knowledge in programming in my opinion is there a free website that offers a tutorial to fluently or at least close to that learn c perhaps you guys are misinterpreting which question i am asking i am not asking which language i should learn i am asking a good tutorial solely and only for c i understand that c is the predecessor of c but i am not asking how to learn c am i i asked for a turorial on c http www cplusplus com and http cprogramming com are probably your two best sites to get standard tutorials you'll also want to keep track of http www parashift com c faq lite and c faq com it's offline at the moment but you can get mirrors at anytime by googling for c faq other sites are usually suspect this includes the days site most resources on c are either incorrect in various ways or are obsolete cboard cprogramming com as well as the devshed c forum and daniweb c forums have some very knowledgeable professionals to help out and you should rely on them to correct mistakes initially their help can make a significant difference in how easily and painlessly you learn with c however the real way to learn it is to get books you can get an idea of how it works through online tutorials and you probably will want to start out with online tutorials but if you are serious about learning it you absolutely must get a number of recognized and important books for c there's a lot and i mean a lot of old incorrect or otherwise terrible c books most of them aimed at beginners the two books i recommend and the books authors are recognized in the c world are c primer th edition by lippman and accelerated c by koenig other recognized books are too advanced you may find both books to be just a bit too fast paced and assuming too much though they really don't but you might find it so apparently you can do it http www amazon com you can beginners introduction programming dp is also a good book i haven't seen it myself but the author is definitely a recognized expert and you can actually get his help sometimes on comp lang c and similar usenet groups might be worth getting his book  $ale of the Century Instant messaging Tic-Tac-Dough Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Gmail Goodness and value theory Spam (electronic) AOL Instant Messenger The Apprentice 2 Google Internet Relay Chat Social rule SmartAsk Wheel of Fortune Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

how does variables and c programs are managed in memory i was recently asked this question on school im referring probably to ram since my programs do not store anything yet any help will be apreciated thanks memory is managed by the heap and on the stack local variables are always on the stack allocating from the stack is done automatically it's fast but stack size is limited allocated memory with malloc or new are on the heap allocation is not as fast as on the stack but you have more memory also you have to free the memory with delete or you get leaks  Hyperlink Web page HTML element HTML World Wide Web Macromedia Flash Cascading Style Sheets Spamdexing Online advertising Wiki HTML editor Web design Yu-Gi-Oh!

graphics design hows the pay i have interest in working in the field of graphics design i have no clue how to do any of it but will be going to college and learning about it is it worth it to take graphic design as my major does it pay well is it easy to find jobs hey norm my experience has been that you will make a moderate income graphic design is such a varied field and there are so many design programs out there and schools who teach it fast and fairly cheap that the market is full of graphic designers it's like playing in a band there's a few who make the really big bucks and live like rock stars but the huge majority are still making a pittance playing the local bar most graphic designers are making between and depending on what part of the country you live in new york pro'lly pays pretty good but the cost of living is quite high orlando fl w disney pays in the lower ranges because everyone wants to work there so they can have it on a resume i live in that area and make hr no benefits except a flexible work schedule and that's pretty good it took me years to get to hr but i will make more with the company i am with obviously lead designers make better that the grunts i see this field as suitable if your job satisfaction is linked more to what you are doing and how well you do it as opposed to how much you make if money is important graphic design is not a sure fire way to make lots of money but it is a lot of fun good luck c  Perl Python programming language PHP String (computer science) C plus plus Forth programming language Regular expression Object-oriented programming Programming language Java programming language World Wide Web Software engineering Hello world program Cascading Style Sheets Garbage collection (computer science) Gmail Scripting language Associative array Comment Linux kernel ALGOL 68 Web crawler Cross site scripting Visual Basic Cocoa (API) Linked list Ajax (programming) Emacs Obfuscated code Hacker BASIC programming language Pointer Game programming Thread (computer science) CPAN Extreme Programming Ebook JavaScript Reflection (computer science) Computer science Lisp programming language Cross-platform Free software Aspect-oriented programming Categorical list of programming languages Wget Computer chess Ocaml Linux CPU cache Game programmer JavaServer Pages Variable Computer virus Uniform Resource Identifier BitTorrent Computer program LaTeX Polymorphism (computer science) Pretty Good Privacy Tcl Class (computer science) Microsoft TeX FAQ Unix Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Numerical analysis Computer Optimization (computer science) Computer programming Uniform Resource Locator Open-source software Compiler Newsgroup Expert system Wiki Website Windows Vista Windows API Artificial neural network Interpreted language GNU General Public License CORBA OpenBSD XML Microsoft .NET Conway's Game of Life Fortran Internet Design pattern (computer science) The Art of Computer Programming Richard Stallman

how do i create a new object for my c class hi i am a newbie to c programming i created a class named mycar my teacher taught me to create a new object of type mycar i would do like this for exmaple a ford mycar ford the problem is i have to type the name ford inside the code so whenever i want to create a new object i physically have to type a new name in the code my goal is that i want to create a new object at runtime so whatever the name i give to the machine at runtime it will use that name to create a new object can anyone show me how or at least point me to a right direction so i can look for it on the internet thank you so whenever i want to create a new object i physically have to type a new name in the code only when you're doing so at compile time that is you need to give a variable a name if you want to create multiple objects you can just place them in an array a good way would be to use a vector and push into it objects as needed my goal is that i want to create a new object at runtime so whatever the name i give to the machine at runtime it will use that name to create a new object not possible it's the wrong idea anyway the names are there only so you while typing code can refer to various objects and variables when converted to an executable these names and symbols in general will get stripped out the computer doesn't deal in names  Uniform Resource Locator HyperText Transfer Protocol Search engine optimization World Wide Web Website SAML Wget Google search HTTP cookie Web server Spamdexing Meta tag Squid cache PageRank Web traffic Jabber Uniform Resource Identifier Mozilla Firefox Delta encoding Web browser Domain Name System Common Unix Printing System Domain name Virtual hosting Ajax (programming) Mydoom Phishing Session Initiation Protocol Typosquatting Google Web Accelerator Internet Proxy server Gmail MSN Messenger Search engine WebDAV Nigritude ultramarine Web analytics BitTorrent Principia Discordia CPAN Google JavaServer Pages Apache HTTP Server Router Denial-of-service attack Opera house Extraterrestrial hypothesis Port numbers Cloaking Bbc.co.uk Slashdot trolling phenomena Link spam Liberal leadership conventions Dacia Wireless Application Protocol World Trade Organization Gopher protocol Wikisource XMLHTTP Lehigh University Unix Mod python Digest access authentication Unicode and HTML Subversion (software) Web design Web crawler Multimedia Messaging System Piedmont Park White House Scalable Vector Graphics Ecclesiastical Latin Character encodings in HTML Slash (punctuation) Cross site scripting Irish language Web cache MOS Technology 6502 Ice core Mozilla Application Suite 400 (number) Warez Network Time Protocol Whois Who is a Jew?

how do i make my website load like this when u first go to websites u will see a bar where a web designer designs it for loading such as http www barbie com u see when u visit this website do u see a loading bar how do you create this does it have anything to do with html if so what is the html then so how can i make it the loading bars are typically flash or java however there is a way to sort of fake something like this without having to learn a programming language you'd still need a bit of javascript though basically without spending a lot of time on a javascript programming lesson here's the idea at the top of your page you create an image a banner of some sort that says loading but the text is in the image you assign a javascript function to the onload event and have it reassign the source file for the loading image to an transparent gif image with small dimensions say x pixel so that the image effectively dissapears after the page has loaded there's always more than one way to do things  Web design Uniform Resource Locator CPAN HyperText Transfer Protocol PHP-Nuke Scalable Vector Graphics Gaia (mythology) Apache HTTP Server PHP Web server Mozilla Application Suite Ajax (programming) BitTorrent Ultraman Gaia Gaia Online Otakon Wget SAML Terranigma 3D computer graphics Armin van Buuren Storm (comics) Environmental ethics Files-11 World Wide Web Dvorak Simplified Keyboard GameFAQs Lotus Notes The Simpsons Stevie Wonder Ragnarok Online PNG Slashdot trolling phenomena HTML Cardcaptor Sakura Z__oty Mozilla Firefox Patricia Ford Domain Name System James Lovelock Macromedia Flash The Isley Brothers ISO 4217 HTML element Associative array Grantley Adams International Airport ZGMF-X88S Gaia Gundam HyperCard TOC protocol Solar variation Web browser Python programming language Zeus Comparison of layout engines (XHTML) Gaia (Foundation universe) Hyakujuu Sentai GaoRanger Pitaten Captain Planet and the Planeteers Call to Power II Kuja Internet forum Vila Nova de Gaia Ultra Series The Who discography Enterprise content management J-pop MySQL The Book of Mozilla Unix History of ecology Maurice Noble Origin belief Yugi Mutou Quotation mark Lynn Margulis Jennifer Lopez Yearbook OpenDocument Pentagram Gaia theory (science) Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition Polymorphism in object-oriented programming Xanga Foundation and Earth Mary Midgley Meaning of life Biosphere Homeostasis MTR MegaMan Battle Network Ecclesiastical Latin Cosmic Era list of characters Principia Discordia Chessington World of Adventures Gaia philosophy Biodiesel Website XMLHTTP Rhythm Nation 1814 Carpal tunnel syndrome

making a form in a java applet i'm trying to make a form on a java applet however i'm finding it very difficult to get the text labels and corresponding textboxes to align themselves one per line gridlayout is what i need to use i think but when i use that it adjusts my textbox components to fill the entire region of their alloted grid cell not what i want there must be an easy way to make a simple form on an applet any help appreciated i'd recommend you switch to a gridbaglayout this will let you specify fill conditions vertical horizontal both none on each component you insert and anchoring which edge of the cell for components that don't fill it completely it's slightly more complex than gridlayout but gives you the control over sizing that you want here's a snippet of some of my code that uses gridbaglayout joptionpanel new jpanel joptionpanel setlayout new gridbaglayout gridbagconstraints gbc new gridbagconstraints gbc fill gbc none gbc gridx gbc gridy gbc weightx gbc weighty gbc insets insets gbc anchor gbc east joptionpanel add getbatchidlabel gbc gbc gridy joptionpanel add getenablegldeletionlabel gbc gbc gridy gbc anchor gbc center joptionpanel add getdotransformbutton gbc gbc fill gbc horizontal gbc gridx gbc gridy gbc anchor gbc west joptionpanel add getbatchidtextfield gbc gbc gridy joptionpanel add getenablegldeletioncheckbox gbc  Autodesk AutoCAD Lisp programming language AutoCAD DXF ActionScript USB flash drive Visual Basic for Applications Level design BIOS AMD Scene graph BRL-CAD Computer-aided design Secure Digital card DOS extender Universal Serial Bus Web application Categorical list of programming languages Macromedia Flash USB mass storage device class Just-in-time compilation File Allocation Table Flash Gordon Flash memory Solid modelling JavaScript DJ Grandmaster Flash Analog-to-digital converter XForms Game programmer Interface (computer science) Flash (comics) Streaming media Flash (photography) Field-programmable gate array PowerPC Computer cluster Tetris Xenon flash lamp Marin County, California File system Command line interface Recursion OpenOffice.org IBM Scalable Vector Graphics Level crossing Java programming language International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems Set construction Plugin Dome of the Rock Commodore 64 Aspect-oriented programming Computer workstation Flash suppressor Timer Virtual machine Conway's Game of Life SOAP PHP Flash Thompson CompactFlash Adobe Illustrator Ajax (programming) FreeJ GDI H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Flash mob Labanotation Dance notation Log-structured file system YellowTAB Zeta Dongle Macromedia Shockwave Wired Equivalent Privacy One-time pad Washington and Lee University Mozilla Firefox Canon EOS NPAPI SWF GeForce 4 SolidWorks BitTorrent Flash fiction Enemies of the Flash Optical computer Flash Flash Revolution Virtual Network Computing Die Hard Password Amiga Symbian OS Flash Gordon (serial) Newgrounds Defender of the Crown Western Digital Time-resolved spectroscopy X-COM

where can i go to get a free background check what websites do any type of free background check even if the info is limited you can perform a free background check like many answers it all depends on the details what information do you want how much work are you willing to do to get it how fast do you want it if you are willing to do some work yourself you can perform a background check on someone for free criminal background check criminal records are kept by the clerk of courts in each courthouse every city town county state and the federal government have their own courthouses we know there are states counties and over cities towns or townships in the usa that is a lot of courthouses and most of them do not share their information however it is all public information and you are allowed to review it if you know where the subject person has lived and traveled then you know which courthouse records to check do it yourself free background check issues a one problem is finding out your subject persons lifetime travel history he could have committed a crime anywhere he has ever been b nd problem is the amount of work you must do to check every courthouse in those locations c rd problem is that you could miss important records if you miss any of the locations that your subject person has been to d th problem is cost if the courthouse has digitized their records and published them on a website then you can often review them for free but if you must travel to the courthouse that requires your time and travel costs finally if you get copy of the record some courthouses charge per page wow that can be expensive e so a do it yourself background check may cost you a significant amount of money if you want to perform a complete background check other records you will probably want to check out some other records on you subject person do your want to know about marriages and divorces bankruptcies tax liens civil law suits professional licenses corporate ownership property ownership all of that information is public and you can review it but you have the same issues that you had with the criminal records the information is not all in one place you have to find out where it is and you may have to travel to those locations information aggregators on the internet some companies specialize in collecting all of this public information putting it in their database and making it available for instant access for example illinois youth soccer http www iysa org has a risk management publication that refers to http backgroundsearch com you can review some of this information for free and get the results immediately on the internet how to perform a do it yourself free background search check step at an information aggregator like backgroundsearch com you can put in your subject person s name and find every city that he lived in that website provides this information for free you can enter as many names as you like as many times as you like now you know which courthouse records to review step at the same website you can find a list of the criminal record offices of every city county and state in the usa along with their website as reported to the u s government step go to the courthouse website or to the courthouse if they do not have a website and review their public records step back at backgroundsearch com you can find the record offices for vital records marriage divorce births deaths repeat step for vital records and any other type of records that you need purchasing a background check if you want to get a complete report instantly you can purchase a comprehensive background check from backgroundsearch com or other information aggregators every company without exception will charge you something for a complete background check the companies have to cover their costs to gather all of the public information put it in a database keep it up to date every day about everyone and make it available to you on the internet for instant access sex offenders the u s government does keep a list of all convicted sex offenders in one place you can find it here http www nsopr gov source s good luck with your

domain redirection question i just got off the phone with my website provider globat and am a little confused let me explain i've been hosting a website for about years now i have a domain name registered which directs traffic to my main site which is a family oriented site i have a section on my site that deals with medical information over the years this section has grown and grown and now is what brings my website most of it's traffic so i want to make it very easy to find this section on my site and decided to register an additional domain name that points directly to that section for example by typing www abc com just an example not really the site name brings you to www mysite com index html i want the new domain name to do this by typing www com which is an example of the newly registered domain name brings you to www mysite com medrecs index html and not www mysite com index html can this be done globat cust service says it can't help this seems simple insomniavisions thanks but i understand that the issue is global is saying that they cannot point the new domain name to a sub section of my website the new domain name can only point to www example com index html it cannot point to www example com subfolder index html i don't understand why this isn't possible how can i do this it can't because domains point to machines and not resources such as web pages what you could do however is simply register a domain name point it to your site and depending on the server platform iis apache etc have the site automatically redirect traffic to a subsection when the url is encountered e g www abc com is your main site www abc com forum index html is where you want things to go is www myforum com is what you register to point to that section of your main site you modify the http server to redirest all traffic pointing to www myforum com to www abc com forum index html you could also do this by modifying your home page if it's php or asp net it's straightforward more info is needed about what you're hosting under updated the reason they can point the http www root com somepage html is that when you go to a domain the web server can be configured to automatically know the default document for that path when you go one more directory however you are using domain resource it can be done using redirects from the home page itself all web enabled technologies can look at what the url is that the user arrived on and act on it for example in asp you can look at the request servervariables server name this also works on php etc if you detect this on the home page you code put into code behind logic to do a response redirect to the other url if you can't code behind the page and can only put html in i can give you a code snippet to achieve your intended outcome using javascript tell me what you have i will try to help you out updated yet again put this javascript with your configuration in your head section of the default page of your website script language javascript type text javascript test to see if i am at the new url make sure to include the default document that appears when you go to your main site url if window location href 'http www someurl com document htm' if not redirect to the main site and sub directory window location 'http www anotherurl com somefolder somepage html' script  HTML element HTML Cross site scripting Hyperlink World Wide Web Web page Search engine optimization Website Markup language XHTML HTML editor Opera (web browser) Macromedia Flash Gmail Uniform Resource Locator Stopping e-mail abuse Wget JPEG Portable Document Format File format Favicon E-mail spam Wiki Web design Spam (electronic) Uniform Resource Identifier Emacs Ajax (programming) Cascading Style Sheets Representational State Transfer Web browser History of the Internet Visual Basic JavaServer Pages Windows XP AOL Instant Messenger Domain Name System PHP Neopets Ebook XML TikiWiki SAML Prank flash Unicode WebObjects Web traffic Dynamic HTML HTML scripting Mouse (computing) Everything2 Kazaa Google bomb Goatse.cx Internet Explorer Quotation mark Logo programming language Phishing HTTP cookie GameFAQs LiveJournal KDE Filename extension Public domain B3ta Google search Mozilla Application Suite Internet fraud Windows 2000 AmigaOS ASCII art Unicode and HTML Page widening Computer virus Xanga Web hosting REBOL OpenOffice.org Wireless Application Protocol MySpace Web 2.0 Spamdexing RSS (file format) Punycode Netscape Navigator OpenDocument Java programming language Blog Web crawler Permalink SCO-Linux controversies H2G2 Del.icio.us HyperText Transfer Protocol Link spam InterWiki Thread (computer science) Linked list Model-view-controller

how form secure by captcha works how exactly captcha works lets say i've a php script and it displays html page with a form and a captcha image but when the user enter the code and hit submit how do the script verify it's the right code what data and where it compares to the code the user entered is it when the script generate the image it also create a cookie or session with that code so when the user hit submit the script can compare the user input to the data on the cookie or session but is captcha to prevent robut to hitting the script can a script to read the session and try to hit the other script to break the system one of two ways the characters generated by the captcha code are stored server side and compared when the user posts web technologies like php asp asp net java etc support the ability to store information about specific sessions server side only that can later be correlated by in memory cookies that are exchanged during requests by the browser and server the key could be encrypted and embedded with the page itself secure as long as a real encryption method like aes is used but it goes against the best practices approach of hiding any unecessary information from users regardless of whether it's encrypted or not  Mouse (computing) Finale notation program Screenshot Digital image editing Minesweeper (computer game) Drill bit Cursor (computers) Mouse Scrollbar Software testing Genetically modified organism Drag-and-drop Adobe Photoshop Mouse gesture Digital photography PNG Hamster AppleScript ImageMagick Good Times Jack Dempsey GIMP B3ta 35 mm film April 1, 2005 Vim (text editor) Internet phenomenon Tux Paint Macromedia Fireworks Black Pete Fitts' law AmigaOS Snooker Apple Macintosh Aspect ratio (image) Police box Cascading Style Sheets Inca Empire Crop circle IPhoto RuneScape Random Events History of the graphical user interface Graphics tablet Boxing Multiple document interface Direct manipulation interface Joseph Smith, Jr. Fark.com Graphics Screenplay Shen Gong Wu Microsoft Paint Loudspeaker Organic farming Playboy (magazine) Irrigation Universal Serial Bus Dobermann Object Desktop IPod Letterbox Photography Digital single-lens reflex cameras Mickey Mouse Twm Flying wing Physical paradox Cardboard Grande Prairie, Alberta Cut and paste MAD Magazine Marching band Viking Age AviSynth Tourist guy Tanbo Ardour (audio processor) Genetic engineering Touchpad Griffon Bruxellois Widget (computing) Click fraud Shifting cultivation Docking JavaScript Taro GIF Kart racing Vernon Schillinger Football (soccer) field Darken Rahl Option key Maze Calvin and Hobbes Rigging Kallithea Jackson Structured Programming Graphic design Fuse (electrical)

how do you save a photoshop project into png or jpg with a transparent background i have photoshop and i have been trying to save what ive been working on into a png or jpg with a transparent background ive searched online and all the sites say to do file save for web i dont have the option 'save for web' under file is there another way to save an image with a transparent background not white i thought that by saving it as a png that it would keep the tranperancy but when i upload it to photobucket it has a white background does photobucket not support transparent backgrounds none of this is working lol its saving with a white background instead of being transparent in the back before i save it it shows it with a transparent background but when i open the saved file it has a white background this is driving me crazy older versions of ie do not support transparency in png files ie finally does jpg files do not support transparency at all your best bet is to save the file as a gif if you want all browsers to handle the transparency photoshop tip if you want transparency start with a true transparent background relying on the save for web feature and picking a transparent color is not very reliable in my experience however if your canvas' background is truly transparent i e the little grey and white boxes you should be fine  Flickr HyperText Transfer Protocol HTML element London Goatse.cx Remora Google Maps HTML CPAN 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Bridge Saturniidae Web server Uniform Resource Identifier Photography Web page Photo sharing ImageMagick Rafflesia Sutro Tower Milan Uniform Resource Locator Warez World Wide Web JPEG Phishing Apache HTTP Server Hampi Ajax (programming) Multimedia Messaging System 4chan Nikko, Tochigi PNG De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter Representational State Transfer Beijing Gmail HTTP cookie Jacques-Louis David Something Awful Forums Slash (punctuation) Digital photography Wikimedia Commons Prank flash Google German federal election, 2005 PHP UFO conspiracy theory The Bund Slashdot trolling phenomena The Best Page in the Universe YTMND Tariq Ali Photoshopping International Marxist Group BitTorrent XMLHTTP XRI Squid cache Instant camera Leica Ivy Photographic lens Graphics B3ta SAML Differentiated services Domain Name System Internet phenomenon Every time you masturbate___ God kills a kitten PlayStation Portable MSN Messenger E.

getting my website to load someone elses website into my content box i'm having coding trouble i'm currently working on a website project for somebody and have run into a problem hopefully some of you can help me out here i have buttons set up that use the following code its all on one line and clicking on the button causes the website to load an html file within a content box i've created td class button listings onclick loadpage ' pages listings html' onmouseover changebutton this true 'button listings' 'button listings down' 'banner listings' onmouseout changebutton this false 'button listings' 'button listings down' 'banner listings' td this works perfectly fine when loading the local page 'listings html' but i want to be able to load someone else's website inside my own content box so that the user can get some information while still retaining my sites header and button set however if i change pages listings html to something like http www yahoo com i get a 'page not found' error does anyone know how i can get this to work the page not found is not what i would expect you to get so first make sure the url is correct try opening it in a fresh window just as it is in your code second and what i think you will find once you get the page to load properly is a feature of most browsers to restrict cross frame scripting you should be able to display someone else's page on yours but you will not be able to manipulate objects on the other page using script on yours third what do you mean by a content box i can't figure out from your code just where this other content is being displayed in an iframe this may be your basic problem to start there may be cleaner ways to do what you are trying to do lastly placing an onclick event handler on a td tag is bad practice in ie you can click on almost anything but many dom's do not support this behavior you are much better off handling onclick events from objects where clicking is a primary behavior e g a button more detail better answers perhaps post your loadpage function  PNG GIF Web page Adobe Photoshop Macromedia Flash PlayStation Portable Sega Saturn Mozilla Firefox Image file formats Mozilla Application Suite ITunes BitTorrent Favicon JPEG EMule Gmail Goatse.cx Portable Document Format Web browser 2D computer graphics Windows Vista Common Unix Printing System Windows 2000 Sega Dreamcast Windows XP Opera (web browser) Tux Paint Resident Evil (video game) JPEG 2000 Internet Explorer Screenshot Macintosh Finder Knoppix ASCII art X Window System PlayStation 2 JavaScript GIMP Blue screen of death Perl B3ta Graphics Mozilla Thunderbird Web hosting HTML element Comparison of layout engines (graphics) Unicode Python programming language Microsoft Office Scalable Vector Graphics AmigaOS Internet phenomenon RGB color model Filename extension Google Final Fantasy (video game) Mouse (computing) File Transfer Protocol Xbox Mac OS X v10.4 Enterprise content management IPhoto XML Mac OS X NTFS Finale notation program Tagged Image File Format Object Desktop Konqueror Uploading and downloading Ebook Lemmings (computer game) Concurrent Versions System Server Exception handling Computer virus Web design Digital image editing Comparison of web browsers KDE PlayStation 3 Newline Stereoscopy Lossless data compression Novell NetWare Netscape Browser Macromedia Fireworks Gallery of sovereign state coats of arms Ajax (programming) Nintendo 64 Xbox 360 Windows Picture and Fax Viewer Microsoft .NET Proxy server QuickTime Adobe Illustrator

blending images with psp create a new larger image than the ones you are copying select the copy images and paste as new layer you can create a selection shape or select a colour if you want a partial selection if you have feathering turned on then you will get faded edges to your selection turn feathering off to get a sharp edge once you have your layer you should be able to drag it around the new image so that it is in the right place when you have all layers in the right places you will now want to merge all layers before you do this save the new image as a type paint shop pro image this will preserve the layers and allow you to move them around later you can also take an existing image as a background and past layers on top of this in the same way save the file as type jpg for internet usage but you may want to use the export function to compress the image this will cause a certain amount of distortion to the image if you play around with the settings you should be able to find a value that will not cause too much distortion you can also re size the image this will also help reduce the download time for internet usage it may also cause some distortion again play around with the size to prevent too much distortion have fun  Goatse.cx PNG Portable Document Format B3ta 4chan Uniform Resource Locator HTML element Teen Girl Squad Search engine optimization Uploading and downloading Newsgroup The Best Page in the Universe Adobe Photoshop Cascading Style Sheets Drawing Internet pornography Wikimedia Commons Atomic Kitten GIMP Finale notation program Visual Basic Editor Gmail PostScript TikiWiki Opera (web browser) Photoshopping Fark.com Mind transfer Web hosting YTMND Wiki Unicode Something Awful Forums Google Video Perl EMule Adobe Illustrator HyperText Transfer Protocol Internet phenomenon Traditional animation Gothic metal Spamdexing Image scanner ASCII art ROM hacking Compiler optimization XHTML INMOS Transputer Internationalization and localization Website Debian Tagged Image File Format IPhoto Enterprise content management BitTorrent HTML editor Umlaut Google search Map MAME Ebook GIF Furcadia Kazaa Homestar Runner JPEG MSN Messenger ImageMagick Emacs Internet Group Management Protocol Stuff (magazine) Computer printer Forth programming language The Legend of Zelda series Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Image Malware GNOME Microsoft Office Macromedia Flash Linker Every time you masturbate___ God kills a kitten Warez Facebook (website) Dynamic HTML Blogger Web design Reconfigurable computing TeX GameFAQs Google Maps Xbox Quotation mark Teletext Flickr STS-114 Objective-C International Phonetic Alphabet

my friend has some crazy ideas what do you think he says that an old version of vlc player has bug that allows for remote code execution i agree he also says that a single avi file is capable of holding shell instruction i get skeptical he also says that by running this avi file in this old version of vlc player the avi is capable of exploiting the bug and then reformatting the entire hard drive here is where i give him the look of disgust is this situation even theoretically possible no the harddrive can simply not be formated when the filesystem is mounted the filesystem can be forced to unmount but not on the partition that holds the system the windows program wil simply not allow it and if you manage to unmount the filesystem somehow windows wil crash instantly and reboot the computer  PlayStation Portable PNG Macromedia Flash Drawing Digital image editing Digital photography Drill bit Mattress Mouse (computing) ITunes MP3 JPEG GIF JPEG 2000 Upholstery Floppy disk CPU cache Stereoscopy IPod PlayStation 3 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Wallpaper group Mac OS X v10.4 Welding Windows XP Eye Computer virus Bass guitar Mars Exploration Rover Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Transformer Radio controlled airplane OpenDocument 2D computer graphics Screenshot Musical Instrument Digital Interface Screw Katana MAME Web page Map projection QuickTime Phase (matter) Nuclear weapon design Glacier Image file formats Nintendo Entertainment System Opportunity rover Adobe Photoshop Windows Vista Guitar Uploading and downloading Fractal MOSFET Pixel Windows 2000 Roxette Plate tectonics Rail tracks Depth of field Ebook E-mail Bloodstain pattern analysis Ra (board game) QuickDraw Knife Loudspeaker DVD Transport Layer Security Solar cell Casting Distortion Anaglyph image Copy protection Blue screen of death Paint Shop Pro Internet Relay Chat Television Geographic information system Enterprise content management Disk image Steganography Glossary of firefighting equipment Soap bubble Portable Document Format Objective-C Sorting algorithm Glass NTFS Eyepiece Memory Stick Architecture of Windows 2000 Leaf Cascading Style Sheets MDAC Rate distortion theory Mozilla Firefox

website hosting linux v s windows i'm setting up my blog with godaddy should i pick linux or windows for my hosting server i know both systems quite well which one is the best in your opinion and why what matters is what you may be running on the server for example if you have a database and you're running mysql you will use linux but if you're running an access database you'll need windows consider all of the pages and technologies of your site if you still have to make a choice go with linux tends to be more stable  Java programming language OpenOffice.org Mac OS X WebObjects Microsoft .NET PHP Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition Macromedia Flash Ajax (programming) Eclipse (computing) Windows XP GNOME Object-SQL mapping Mozilla Firefox Session Initiation Protocol QuickTime Object-oriented programming Arianne Windows Vista Sun Microsystems Scalable Vector Graphics Windows 2000 Standard Widget Toolkit Opera (web browser) ITunes OpenDocument Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Google search OpenGL Python programming language Computer-aided design Voice over IP BPEL X Window System C Sharp Regular expression Microsoft Qt (toolkit) IBM PC compatible NVIDIA FreeBSD Enterprise Objects Framework Universal Plug and Play WordPerfect BitTorrent Blu-ray Disc OSGi Grid computing Symbian OS C plus plus PlayStation 3 2D computer graphics Web crawler MySQL Open source culture ATI Technologies Managed learning environment Btrieve PIC microcontroller Java platform Expert system Geographic information system Wi-Fi TikiWiki Commodore 64 Berkeley Software Distribution DragonFly BSD Wireless Application Protocol Apache License Visual Basic .NET AMD Cocoa (API) Windows Server 2003 Java virtual machine Netscape Communications Corporation Unicode Microsoft Access Stopping e-mail abuse Nintendo DS OS/2 Linux Bluetooth Perl Integrated development environment ASP.NET World Wide Web Apple Computer Palm OS General Dynamics F-111 Tux Paint Sega Dreamcast RIFE OpenStep Xcode Internet Explorer Common Lisp Sprite (computer graphics) Workflow Objective-C Gmail

font problems i am working with adobe indesign cs pc and i own baskerville old face regular i want the font to appear bold and i have been told the best way to achieve this is to purchase baskerville old face bold i cannot use a different font this is a corporate brand must use this font and i am planning only to purchase the bold variation not the entire font family i am not sure which bold font style will match my current baskeville font when i went to www fonts com to purchase this font style i found different variations of the font and i am not sure which one to get the variations found are the following monotype baskerville new baskerville itc new baskerville it does not appear itlaic so i dont think itc stand for italic baskerville book baskerville small caps itc new baskerville ce bold itc new baskerville cyrillic expert bold osf what the differences and how do i know which one to get itc is an acronym for the international typeface corporation they make approximately fonts and the itc lets you know which ones they designed and distributed the itc new baskerville fonts you have there are all from the same family you have a regular version a cyrillic expert bold version and a cyrillic expert bold old style figures bold version what makes me upset when companies use a particular font for their image the designers who created it often fail to look at how broad of range the font can actually be used for italic bold black the baskerville of bold font you need to find doesn't exist but you have plenty of baskerville fonts all not in the same family which is why they are called something different but all that look the same and are part of different families baskerville old face was a font used for centuries on old type setters but there was no bold italic or anything mainly used for old text in books new baskerville was designed to be an updated version that had a broad range of uses one that has bold italic black bold italic etc they are the same font but one is slightly more modern purchase the new baskerville bold and you'll be golden compare the upper case q for the old face baskerville you already have on your pc and the new baskerville bold you purchase and you'll see one of the subtle changes others changes exist but this is the most obvious it's the tail of the q most changes only happen to the weird and less used letters figures q z x etc new baskerville bold will do the trick for you http www myfonts com fonts linotype itc new baskerville bold  Adobe Photoshop Microsoft Office GIMP Adobe Systems Adobe Illustrator PNG IPod Adobe Acrobat Corel Digital image editing Photoshopping Microsoft Weekly newspaper Apple Computer ImageMagick IPhoto Paint Shop Pro 2D computer graphics Visual Basic .NET Apple Macintosh Microsoft Windows OpenOffice.org Linspire Favicon Text editor WordPerfect Vector graphics editor Ebook GIF RGB color model Editor Macromedia Flash GNU General Public License JavaScript Adobe InDesign PostScript Bryce Finale notation program Trademark Windows Vista OpenDocument Graphic design IPod photo Game programmer Microsoft Paint Desktop publishing Digital audio workstation Tagged Image File Format C plus plus Playboy (magazine) Mac OS X 2000 Australian Grand Prix Windows Mobile Microsoft .NET Forth programming language First-sale doctrine Counterfeit Portable Document Format Version Macromedia Fireworks Game programming Xerox Star OpenType FrameMaker Windows registry Chess Visual Basic MacPaint Microsoft Word Opera (web browser) Fark.com Girls Aloud Style guide Yearbook Java programming language Tux Paint Multiple document interface Inheritance (computer science) Library (computer science) Apple typography IBM PC compatible HyperCard Visual C Plus Plus Atari 8-bit family Pornography Microsoft Flight Simulator The Sims Emacs Windows XP Plugin Edlin Ashton-Tate Windows API Drawing MDAC Poker jargon Internet fraud History of Microsoft Windows System/34 The Star Wars Holiday Special

how the hell do i work windows movie maker i want t be able to download episodes off of websites and use them on movie maker but for some reason they have zipped in and i don't know what that means then when i save it it always says that i can't use it because of the format but i don't know what other things i can use tell me how to get the episodes on to movie maker without it telling me to have it in another format also what the hell does ' zipped' mean help zipped means the file has been placed into an archive which compresses the code so it is smaller and easier to transport across networks the extension you are referencing is zip or rar most likely windows xp has a native function which allows you to unzip the zip archive by simply double clicking on the zipped file it should open up a wizard on your desktop that will walk you through the process of unzipping the file if your version of windows doesn't have an unzip utility there are dozens of them out there freeware and shareware just search the web for file unzip software or unzip freeware pkunzip pkzip and winrar are three programs that i find to be useful and simple to use  NX bit Free Pascal Cygwin CPU design PaX X86 AMD64 C programming language Mac OS X Allegro library X86 assembly language OpenStep 64-bit Google CPU cache Symmetric multiprocessing Microprocessor NVIDIA Intel iAPX 432 Pentium 4 Mac OS 9 Mac OS X v10.4 Windows Vista Apple Intel transition Floating point Search engine IA-64 DOS extender Malloc Google Desktop Sequent Computer Systems Intel i960 Mozilla Firefox IBM PC compatible Intel i860 Linux kernel Motorola 68000 Pentium D Windows NT Buffer overflow Memory-mapped I/O IA-32 Timeline of computing 1990-forward RISC Ethernet Socket 939 MS-DOS DVD History of Microsoft Windows Berkeley Software Distribution OpenBSD Novell NetWare Word (computer science) Windows 2000 Central processing unit OpenDocument DragonFly BSD Rambus Cisco PIX Cache Character encoding L4 microkernel family Multics Googlewhack Plan 9 (operating system) DESQview Graphical Environment Manager 68k Radiation hardening PL/I Hyper-threading OS/2 MUMPS Tarantella, Inc.

permutations combinations of list i need to write a permutation algorithm in abap language for a given set of letters i need to determine the unique permutations as follows example set includes a b c d unique permutaions include a b c d ab ac ad bc bd cd abc acd bcd abcd note ab ba thanks for the answer mcfate i'm not familiar w java so it s somewhat difficult to follow your example can you explain how the solution would look if the results were in ascending order don't have abap handy but here it is in java it's a trivial program and should be easy to translate as long as you can do x x and bitwise and or a test of the nth bit in an integer y n public class myclass public static void main string args string c abcd int numchars c length int permutations numchars chars for each permutation for int i i permutations i print it out from the binary number for int j j numchars j int jthbit j boolean jthbitisset i jthbit if jthbitisset system out print c charat j system out println output a b ab c ac bc abc d ad bd abd cd acd bcd abcd how it works there are n combinations of each character from the original string being either present or not present in any solution so one can represent each solution as a different binary number with one digit corresponding to each character of the original string i use the loop iterator i to count up to n all binary numbers that can be represented in a number of digits equal to the number of characters in the original string each value of i represents one member of the permutations set the interior loop j is used to print each character corresponding to a bit in i to print out the permutation that corresponds to the binary number in i  Wiki DAEMON Tools Scalable Vector Graphics Uniform Resource Locator OpenBSD Common Unix Printing System Mozilla Firefox BitTorrent Domain Name System Warez ITunes Linux GIMP Python programming language Apache HTTP Server Mozilla Application Suite Website Secure Shell Internet Relay Chat Wireless Application Protocol Geographic information system Wikipedia SUSE Linux Free software C plus plus Spyware Digital art Daemon (computer software) Network Time Protocol Microsoft .NET Free audio software VBulletin Knoppix KDE Mac OS X v10.4 Demoscene Collaborative software Linspire Java programming language GNOME OpenOffice.org Apache Software Foundation Proxy server HTTP cookie HTML Unix Bulletin board system Screenshot MIRC Gnutella Linux distribution Ada programming language Tcl MSN Messenger PlayStation 3 Debian Berkeley Software Distribution Session Initiation Protocol HyperCard GNU/Linux naming controversy Configuration management Eclipse (computing) Macromedia Flash Mandriva Linux Sega Dreamcast Web server Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing LiveCD Commodore 64 Lotus Notes Portable Document Format Operating system Whois MP3 Game programming Adobe Photoshop REALbasic ISBN MySQL TikiWiki Mac OS X Wikisource Rootkit VMware Xbox 360 MediaWiki Gmail Open Directory Project Telnet Digital audio workstation International Organization for Standardization GIF Theora ASCII art ROM image Console emulator Open access PHP Windows API

ms access question i am currently doing a project where i created a microsoft access form database to collect data for stormwater data i e manholes catch basins culverts pipes ditches etc however i have numerous inputs that do not need to show the whole time for example if you pick that the shape of a culvert is a circle you will be prompted for the diameter of the pipe so on and so forth it has been years since i have used ms access and need to be refreshed on how to program for access any sites of programming codes would be greatly appreciated as well as any expressions you have for the described statement above as i cannot seem to get it to work the way i want it to i can only get it to work if all of the inputs show at all times thank you in advance and i hope you can give me some great input it sounds like you want to create a custom form and then put the options you want behind them as unbound options this makes it easier and then once you have the options you want you can save the data to the tables what this does is allows you to customize your form to pull the data you want and then save it as you see fit a good place to learn stuff is just by going to microsoft's website and they have how to's on there site some are good and some not so good but if you search you can find some basic info anything beyond that you would have to take someone's example and then mold it to your needs  JavaScript Hello world program Datatype Objective Modula-2 Python programming language Pointer Mozilla Firefox Mozilla Application Suite String (computer science) C programming language Copy protection Internet Explorer PHP PaX Perl Forth programming language Extreme Programming Morse Code Document Object Model Quicksort DOM Events Library (computer science) Buffer overflow Object lifetime Windows 2000 Exponentiation by squaring Compiler optimization Lisp programming language Greasemonkey Federal Standard 1037C Static single assignment form Dynamic programming MD5 C Sharp ALGOL 68 Edgard Var__se Immutable object Associative array Bol__var's War Control character Comparison of web browsers User agent One-time pad Digital rights management Backup Compiler C syntax Computer Prototype-based programming Euphoria programming language Halting problem Software testing E programming language Unicode 400 (number) Architecture of Windows 2000 MDAC Appeal Redundant array of independent disks Copyleft Estimation theory Cross site scripting Bash Password cracking Callback (computer science) Dynamic HTML Mutation Web crawler JSON Pretty Good Privacy Kernel (computer science) REXX Macromedia Flash Newline Garbage collection (computer science) NX bit Timeline of computing 1990-forward JScript .NET Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm Value at risk Polymerase chain reaction DirectShow Self programming language X86 assembly language Comparison of generics to templates Air traffic control Halo 2 Copyright law of the United Kingdom XML Brainfuck Revision control Objective-C Cryptography Plan 9 (operating system) Mach kernel Short message service REBOL Ethernet

mvs ca jcl question i am trying to update several hundred tapes in tms using tmsupdte the tapes are random volsers with different conditions so a tmsgrw is out of the question i would like to scan the tapes into a list then use that list as input source file tmcupdt job hcscscco 'some user' msglevel class u prty msgclass t notify someuser s exec pgm tmsupdte parm 'test' steplib dd disp shr dsn sys prod tms load restrict tmsrpt dd sysout sysin dd for f list in mydataset do vol list nodsn rep outcode hexzero rep outdate zeros rep slot hexzeros that oughta keep yer operators busy for awhile i'm at home so i don't have my ol' manuals handy but one thing i notice right off is you don't have a target for the unlikely but logically important possibility the list is empty where's either a jobstep before s for opening the dataset to hold the tape volume list to be written one vol at a time by your loop or a var in s to build and hold an array of tapes i personally don't know tms i just remember rexx where's the step for closing the list of tapes to be used later i would think most likely you'd use the path use a jobstep before s to open a temp file in s set up to write out a record each time to that temp file if the conditions are met then a step after s to use the resulting tapes and a jobstep after that to cleanup and erase the temp file but i'm likely not giving you the real help you need in s que no  Grep Perl Filename extension Portable Document Format File Transfer Protocol Regular expression Pipeline (Unix) File format Request for Comments Binary and text files AWK programming language Diff Sed Unix COMMAND.COM File Allocation Table Domain-specific programming language Bash ALGOL 68 TeX Ebook PNG C programming language Domain Name System CP/M Novell NetWare OpenDocument Windows Vista MBASIC Web crawler Computer virus Computer science Logo programming language Metadata Enterprise content management REBOL BASIC programming language Server Text editor Asterisk Ed Programming tool Password Trojan horse (computing) Common Unix Printing System Brainfuck Control flow Linked list UBASIC Chmod Newline Geographic information system Mac OS X ITunes Files-11 Shell script MUMPS Tar (file format) E-mail Apple typography Blog Podcasting Search engine optimization Vertical bar Password cracking New I/O Master Control Program Screenshot Btrieve Whois Pretty Good Privacy Data General Nova SAS System MP3 Open access MIME AmigaOS XML Hello world program Usenet Quicksort Batch file DVD File sharing System 7 (Macintosh) Translation memory Morse Code Freenet Raster graphics Internet Relay Chat GIF HP BASIC for OpenVMS PlayStation Portable Web page Uniform Resource Locator Apple II family

how to write c program how to write a c program that determine the average velocity of a moving object whose position in time is represented by user specified quadratic or cubic curve the program should first ask the user whether the velocity to be determined is from a quadratic or cubic curve and then the program must specifically cater for the request how to write a c program which gets from user a quadratic equation within an integral and approximates its integration value based on the trapezoidal method thanks get the input eqn as a string specifying only the coefficient of powers eg if eqn is x t t t user should enter this is only for reduction in input parameter parsing logic and stuff then get the differential of the eqn w r t t by using the formula of diff for polynomials and substitute the values you get the velocity as for the trapezoidla method try an iterative approach interpolating the curve at regular intervals must be quite easy to implement on a computer in c  Konfabulator XUL Widget Widget (computing) Widget toolkit Yahoo!

how do i make objects proportionate to the form in visual basic properly the question title can't really be that good so let me explain i have to make this form in visual basic i have here a filelistbox and some combo list boxes and an imagebox where i'm making an image viewer how do i keep the combo list boxes remain at least a few cms away from the form even if i resize it the file list box also needs to decrease its height proportionate enough not to go through the other buttons but expanding just enough to remain proportionate to the form same with the image box but i have added a stretch function too that's supposed to make the image stretch when a checkbox is clicked i want that the imagebox should be proportionate to the form even when resized but with the stretch still working please help i'm so confused for future reference i recommend that you also specify which visual basic version you are using or net because they can be very different i am going to assume you mean net when you select a control on your form in its properties you will find a property called anchor which will allow you to essentially lock the control in place relational to the form's edge so for instance if i put a button on my form and i set the button's anchor property to anchor to the right by clicking the little right outline in the little screen that pops up i am telling the button to stay at its location relative to the right edge so when the width of the form grows the button will follow along keeping the same padding between it and the forms right edge by default a control is usually anchored to the top and left edges you can anchor to one or more edges at the same time by anchoring to three or more edges you will force the button to grow and shrink along with the form but for your viewer you are probably going to link most controls to two edges except for the viewing area which you may want to link to all for edges so it will grow and shrink with the size of the form you usually find articles talking about anchoring at the same time they talk about docking docking however puts the control tied to the edge rather than floating away from it like anchoring does the link below will show you a bit of what i am talking about and how to use it enjoy  Metalanguage

missing columns when importing an access report into excel i'm using access excel winxp sp i've got a report which totals some values when i export the report to excel my totals column is missing this has only just started to happen and i can't think that i've made any changes that might have caused it i've discovered that if i put the report into design mode then without making any changes go back into view mode then export again the totals column is no longer missing however if i just run the export again the totals column is missing again wtf so i can work around the problem but would like a solution if poss as i'm not the only user of this system and the other users would be stuck i read that this is a known bug but details on how to avoid it would be good exporting to excel from an access report is 'icky' excel needs to understand columns etc which can confuse it i haven't heard or come across this exact problem in my years of experience with access excel i would suggest one of two things export your report directly from the query not the report or use ms query from excel to pull the data through into the spreadsheet this is also useful because you can amend the setting of the query so that you can always have totals at the bottom or by the side etc not matter how many lines of data you have  PHP Ajax (programming) Btrieve SQL PHP-Nuke Database management system MySQL Microsoft SQL Server Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition Microsoft Oracle database Open Database Connectivity Microsoft Access Cross site scripting Apache HTTP Server Lotus Notes Ragnarok Online HyperText Transfer Protocol Web design Perl MapleStory PostgreSQL Oracle Corporation Database MDAC Search engine TikiWiki BitTorrent XML BZFlag Microsoft Jet Database Engine DB2 Object-SQL mapping Google MUMPS BEA WebLogic Blog Sybase Google search Proxy server Website Base64 SQL injection Microsoft Office SharePoint Portal Server GameFAQs Wget EMule Enterprise content management Categorical list of programming languages Common Unix Printing System Computer security Electronic commerce CPAN Domain Name System Mozilla Application Suite Cheating in Counter-Strike PL/SQL Wiki Windows XP Java programming language Python programming language Tandem Computers ASP.NET Mozilla Firefox WebObjects WebSphere Freenet SAS System Ingres Mach kernel HTTP cookie Spring operating system Wikipedia Novell NetWare Web server Open Directory Project Relational model Transmission Control Protocol Mac OS X Microsoft .NET Informix Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition Web hosting Windows Vista Search engine optimization Quest Software Web service Apple Computer Visual Basic Whois Typo3 Java Database Connectivity VBulletin Diablo II Final Fantasy XI Web traffic World Wide Web Representational State Transfer Flickr

is there a simple way of getting exchange public contacts into a net application this is such basic powerful functionality i'm sure it must have been done before but much as i search on google i can't find anything that works i've tried half a dozen obscure workarounds to achieve this not one of them has worked all i get is error messages from deep inside the mail api and googling them simply leads to dead ends so if anyone out there knows how to simply get a list of public exchange contacts into a net application i'd love to hear from you thanks for the csv suggestion it may be the only way but i'd prefer to have the list updated every time the application starts the reason being the user of the application isn't well versed in outlook and i don't want them having to update stuff whenever a person joins or leaves the company which is quite frequent here you can use ado to query exchange server's store for its public contacts through exchange's built in ole db driver and use it to add modify delete contacts too http msdn microsoft com en us library ms aspx i know the link above references sql server but you can use the basic concepts to connect from a net app using the system data oledb namespace  Favicon Web page GIF JPEG PNG Web browser PlayStation Portable ImageMagick Mozilla Application Suite Internet Explorer Image file formats Mozilla Firefox Adobe Photoshop Portable Document Format Scalable Vector Graphics HTML Filename extension File Transfer Protocol BitTorrent XHTML Unicode Macromedia Flash HTML element Konqueror Windows Picture and Fax Viewer Pixel art Cascading Style Sheets Social Democratic Party (Portugal) Gallery of sovereign state coats of arms Web design Lossless data compression Internet pornography Bulletin board system Icon (computing) Opera (web browser) Uploading and downloading World Wide Web JPEG 2000 SWF ASCII art Gmail Macintosh Finder MNG Wiki AmigaOS Internet Explorer for Mac Uniform Resource Locator Comparison of web browsers Cross site scripting XML Robots Exclusion Standard Graphics VRML Comparison of layout engines (graphics) Gallery of flags based on British ensigns Web analytics EMule Ebook Browser wars Mouse (computing) File format Flags of non-sovereign nations CompuServe ITunes RSS (file format) Pixel Gallery of flags by design KHTML Screenshot Flickr Web hosting Common Unix Printing System Netscape Navigator ROM hacking JavaScript Unicode and HTML Comparison of media players MySpace XForms Debian Apostrophe (mark) Netscape Browser Dither Website Ico (video game) Pipeline (Unix) Hyperlink AOL Instant Messenger Kazaa Captain Sega Dreamcast PlayStation 2 Trusted computing Caldas da Rainha Mac OS X Microbrowser Wallpaper group Blogger Representational State Transfer Data compression

computers fbi etc hi this may be hard to explain i want to become good with computers so that i can get into the fbi i downloaded python and tried it out i want to know how to actually do stuff useful also is it possible to be a computer wizard in the fbi and still go on the field to make arrest and stuff or do i have to choose if anyone could give me advice on computers how to become good websites books free programs tips anything i really want to be able to do cool stuff if i need to expand this more then let me know thanks i would recommend getting a computer science degree with some kind of technological criminal justice stuff learn about computer forensics python is not usually a recommended language to begin in try something like perl or if you're feeling courageous learn c or c learn to use linux along with windows familiarize yourself with as much information about how computers work as you can i would scour the web for as many tutorials as you can find google is your best friend i'm not really sure about the whole going on the field thing but i would guess probably not unless there is some good reason for you to be there but i guess there are reasonable needs for computer experts on the field browse the net for stuff on programming networking computer science and especially computer forensics it's just your luck that the fbi really needs people who want to do what you want to do enjoy and good luck  DVD PlayStation Portable Commodore DOS PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Hard disk Virtual memory XML File format CPU cache File Allocation Table File system permissions Windows XP Emacs NTFS Disk image Objective-C Computer virus Floppy disk Windows registry Trademark C programming language PNG Computer security Nine Inch Nails PlayStation 3 Warez Cache Master Control Program Journaling file system Plain text Windows 2000 OpenDocument Register file File sharing Windows Vista Python programming language Trusted computing Newline Computer file Windows 95 Modchip Napier's bones File system Cascading Style Sheets Screenshot Enterprise content management Document Type Definition Digital rights management Forth programming language Serialization Gmail PaX Register renaming Josh McDowell ISO 9660 Text editor Biblical canon Debugging Redundant array of independent disks Header file Killian documents Pipeline (Unix) Backup Dd (Unix) E-mail Source code Ls Revision control Usenet Symbolic link Adobe Photoshop Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Uploading and downloading Ext3 Icon programming language QuickTime Ebook HFS Plus Rn (newsreader) Filename extension Unix File System Macintosh Finder NTFS junction point Portable Document Format Tao Te Ching Image file formats Stardock XSL Transformations MBASIC Apple Computer Kingdom Hospital Public domain Drake and Josh Linux kernel Flash memory Polymorphism (computer science) Library (computer science) AppleScript A Course In Miracles

how to insert one layer into another file using actions in photoshop hi i am trying to apply a watermark to some images that will go up on my site i have quite a few so rather than do each one seperately i want to create an action that will make the watermark move it and lower opacity i'll then use photoshop's batch feature to do all the images at once however i've hit a snag i've used actions before but never have i had to import an image from a different file my watermark is in a file of its own and i'm having troubles getting it into the file with my image although cutting and pasting does work for one image the other images return errors when the action hits the copy layer step i would like to know if there's a simple way of somehow importing my watermark and as i said before if i copy and paste or just drag the layer from one file to another it only works once thx did you know in photoshop if you have two images open you can drag one onto the other automatically creating another layer hope this helps stuart http www layeroneuk com manufacturers aspx  Computer wallpaper DeviantART PlayStation Portable Website Goatse.cx Legal research Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act America Online ROM image The Best Page in the Universe Autostereogram ITunes A Course In Miracles Windows Vista Potassium nitrate Webster's Dictionary Virgin Mobile Windows XP Tux Paint PNG Star Trek, other storylines E-mail Dictionary CPU cache Xbox Live Quebec Resident Evil Digital Millennium Copyright Act A Tale of a Tub Wallpaper group Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media NOFX Internet Mnemonic Facebook (website) Social bookmarking Yellow Pages Jigsaw puzzle The Onion Encyclopedia Yearbook Hey Jude Homestar Runner Myst franchise BMW Oscar Wilde BBC News Online Traditional animation Password Sony The Sydney Morning Herald Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Point groups in three dimensions Manga Active Desktop DC Comics Symmetry H2G2 Egyptian language Time Inc.

how do i send form results to an email using javascript what is the line of code to send form results to an email address someone wrote me a whole form with but it doesn't sent the results to my email javascript will not be able to provide this functionality however an another way of doing this is to set the action on the form to a mail address eg form action mailto you domain method post enctype text plain this will allow the components of the form be sent to the you however this relies on the user having a mail client setup on their machine to bring up outlook or some over mail client if this is not present this will not work a better approach is to submit the form to a server process running on the machine this can be php cgi cfm or a java server to process the form and then send an email this doesn't rely on a user configuration and doesn't expose your email address if you don't want to  Adobe Photoshop Paint Shop Pro World Wide Web Macromedia Flash Web server HyperText Transfer Protocol Wget Microsoft Office IPhoto Gmail Uniform Resource Locator Image Gnutella Common Unix Printing System GIMP Spyware Web page PNG Portable Document Format 2D computer graphics Kazaa Representational State Transfer ITunes Website Geographic information system Ebook GIF JavaScript Mozilla Firefox ImageMagick QuickTime Web crawler Tagged Image File Format XHTML Wiki Ajax (programming) Mozilla Application Suite Lotus Notes Windows Vista File format Opera (web browser) IPod Internet Web analytics Mac OS X v10.4 VirtualDub Filename extension Screenshot Scalable Vector Graphics Warez REALbasic Photoshopping OpenOffice.org Tux Paint Digital image editing BitTorrent HTML Microsoft ASCII art CPAN Thin client Something Awful Forums Web browser Photoshop contest HTML element Google Maps Commodore 64 PHP Slash (punctuation) Cascading Style Sheets Podcasting Favicon Character encodings in HTML Unicode and HTML Mac OS X Digital photography Flickr Secure Shell Gopher protocol Adobe InDesign PlayStation Portable Wales RGB color model Apple Computer Graphics Wireless Application Protocol OpenDocument Timeline of computing 1990-forward WebDAV Domain Name System Exchangeable image file format Copyleft File Transfer Protocol Microsoft Paint Streaming media Charles Ives FastTrack POV-Ray ILife

about microsoft paint and pixels why is it that some pixel shades appear when text is magnified and expanded in ms paint but in regular view you may not get the light gray in between gray and white would you see it if you took a magnifying class and looked real close at it when its normal sized or not because if i get up real close it just looks white you know actually you do get the inbetween shades in regular view its just that you can't tell that its there because the pixels are small the reason that the light gray is there in the first place is so that the lines don't seem so jagged you're not supposed to really see the light grey because its there to blend the transition from grey to white  HyperText Transfer Protocol HTML element GameFAQs Objective-C Uniform Resource Locator Something Awful Forums Internet forum Gmail Ajax (programming) C programming language Windows 2000 Files-11 Blog C plus plus CPAN RuneScape cheats Billiards OpenDocument Democratic Underground Slashdot subculture Textile manufacturing LiveJournal Digest access authentication Thread (computer science) Cross site scripting YaBB Machinima Virtual memory Politics of Quebec Geographic information system Domain Name System IPv6 JavaServer Pages Atari 8-bit family World Economic Forum HTTP cookie Web traffic Star Trek, other storylines Internet troll Compiler optimization Spyware 2channel WebSphere PHP SCO v.

how do i create my own blog personal web space i'm pretty web savvy and do some coding but i'd love to learn about the best resources on the web for templates tools and guidance for building my own blog web space thanks you can go to wordpress and download their blogging software to install it on your own site that way you can have your own domain name using their open source blogging technology the other option is signing up for an account on their site and starting your blog site there but your domain name would be www yourusername wordpress com the downside of installing it is that you'll need to maintain your site for security updates whereas with having an account you don't have to worry about that you could pay a year to have your own domain name point to yourusername wordpress com if you choose but once your reader is redirected they may end up seeing the longer url not sure about this good luck p s wordpress does have templates you can choose from  Pixel Color Microsoft Paint Typeface Anti-aliasing Atari 8-bit family Pixel art Color theory Grayscale Autostereogram Vertex and pixel shaders 2D computer graphics RGB color model PNG Grey Computer graphics Camouflage Raster graphics Mouse (computing) James McNeill Whistler Toronto Transit Commission Stereoscopy Regular expression Halftone NVIDIA Apple typography Blue Drawing Procedural texture Color Graphics Adapter Sega Saturn Gouraud shading Impressionism Cat coat genetics Missingno.

why div and not table there are a number of reasons to use divs first page rendering is quicker with them second they allow for more complex and beautiful designs a third reason and probably the most important has to do people who use screen readers these users may turn off the css for a site for simplicity and when they do this a site built within tables will not always properly lay out the content in logical order as a result these users may have hard time following the content and you as the author will lose much of your intention it's important to keep this audience in mind when building a site because if you have an e store you don't want to confuse users who might leave without buying if you're going to use a table use it for tabular data that's what tables are intended for  Quotation mark Browser wars XML transformation language XPath Ajax (programming) World Wide Web Consortium Gecko (layout engine) Cross site scripting Uniform Resource Locator File format E-learning XUL Apache Cocoon Microbrowser Semantic Web Document Object Model Hello world program Representational State Transfer SAML RSS (file format) JavaScript JavaServer Pages Dynamic HTML Common Unix Printing System OpenOffice.org Numeric character reference Rich Internet Application 24SevenOffice Enterprise content management TikiWiki Michael Morrison Wikipedia Transclusion Wireless Markup Language Zope Packages in Java International Phonetic Alphabet Wget HyperText Transfer Protocol Java programming language WebDAV PHP Metalanguage Bracket WYSIWYG Namespace (computer science) XMLHTTP Comment User interface markup language Open Document Architecture Web application Inkscape Standard Generalized Markup Language Resource Description Framework RIFE Web colors Eclipse (computing) The Book of Mozilla RELAX NG Digital television Internet Explorer for Mac

what is vba what does it do and hoe does it work what is vba visual basic for applications visual basic for applications is a programming language that allows you to customize and extend your software program to suit your needs it can automate common tasks you manually complete your application will become more effective and efficient when you use vba to enhance your work vba is available in all of the ms office suite programs word powerpoint excel and access as well as visio and project it is also available in many other non microsoft applications under license to microsoft e g autocad with vba you can combine the power of more than one application for an integrated solution the key to understanding vba is recognizing that it is a programming language within the host software program it must be available in the software program and the software program must be running to work with it with that said you must have a solid background in the software program in which you want to create an automated solution using vba you must understand how the program works before you start planning what you want to accomplish and knowing how you would get the results manually is important for successful vba programs a vba program is often referred to as a macro the vba program or macro is a block of instructions the software program carries out when the macro is initiated it can include prompts for user input display popup boxes with instructions or information and customized menus and toolbars essentially it performs all of the steps you would need to make manually with your keyboard and mouse to accomplish your task for example you need to extract certain pieces of information from your word document to send to your clients as a confirmation of the work order right now you are manually copying the original file to a new document and deleting the lines that are for internal use only once you have modified the document to include only the information necessary to send to the client you email the modified document to them think about how many steps you would have to take to accomplish this task each time you can write a macro to execute these steps within a matter of a few seconds at the push of one button clearly this would save you a large amount of time i have been involved with developing some vba applications that have saved user's as much as days work each time the macro runs overtime these efficiencies can really add up  Canada 2001 Census Electronic commerce Advance fee fraud Outsourcing MMORPG Social Security (United States) Micropayment Make money fast Web traffic Common Unix Printing System Freeters Income Minimum wage Microeconomics Grand Theft Auto (game) Tax Mail fraud Measures of national income and output Opera (web browser) Unemployment Anarchism and capitalism Unemployment benefit Google Online shop Copyleft Wal-Mart Gaia Online Lottery Genealogy Student loan Spyware Economics Surveillance Online poker Graduate school Bond Credit card Islamic banking FairTax Credit card fraud Finance World Wide Web 401(k) Compensation of employees Vending machine Economic inequality Debt Online marketing Medicare (Canada) Social Credit Animal Crossing United States Postal Service Brian Jones (musician) RuneScape Domain Name System Labour economics Internet Speculative Fiction Database The Apprentice 2 Paul W.

what do youn mean by array array in c programming arrays in c act to store related data under a single variable name with an index also known as a subscript it is easiest to think of an array as simply a list or ordered grouping of variables as such arrays often help a programmer organize collections of data efficiently and intuitively meaning an array is a variable that holds multiple values of the same type in c and c arrays and pointers have a lot in common also remember that arrays and pointers have a special relationship this is because arrays use pointers to reference memory locations therefore most of the times pointer and array references can be used interchangeably example for numbers it is int numbers for characters char letters example of declarations int vector if we want to access a variable stored in an array for example with the above declaration the following code will store a in the variable x int x x vector and so on if your studying bout array for it to be flexible you also might wanna check pointers scalar indexing strings and looping  Hello world program Pointer C programming language C syntax Boolean algebra Exception handling Quicksort Function (mathematics) ALGOL 68 Floating point Generic programming Printf Sorting algorithm Subroutine UTF-8 Discrete Fourier transform Heapsort Fischer Random Chess Brainfuck Debugging Shor's algorithm Prolog Kolmogorov complexity Computer numbering formats Compiler optimization Associative array Quantum computer Boost library Class (computer science) Python programming language Paging C Sharp Computer Magic number (programming) Reference (C Plus Plus) Objective-C Eight queens puzzle Object lifetime Halting problem CPU cache Name mangling E-mail spam Emacs Reductio ad absurdum Trigonometric function Xor swap algorithm Identical particles Discrete wavelet transform Infinity Java programming language Probability density function Normal distribution Expert system Virtual memory Algorithm Reynolds number On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Control flow Central processing unit G__del's incompleteness theorem Wallpaper group Australian electoral system X86 assembly language Tagged union Lambda calculus Red-black tree Emulator Global climate model Luzon Functional programming Visitor pattern Datatype SHA hash functions Endianness Buffer overflow Linked list Tower of Hanoi Hash table Windows 2000 Order theory Page table Median Icon programming language Iterator NaN Resource Acquisition Is Initialization Group (mathematics) Field (mathematics) Collision detection Trombone Computational complexity theory C preprocessor Lisp programming language Thread (computer science) Analog-to-digital converter Selection algorithm Topology glossary Gmail Nuclear power

can i change the system date and time using python it doesn't appear that there's any nice way to do this in python but you can execute command line programs to change it for you on linux systems you use the 'date' program to set both the date and the time simply execute 'date mmddhhmm cc yy ss ' using os system on windows xp you need to use two separate commands for the date and time 'date' and 'time' respectively which take the new date and time as arguments i'd imagine other operating systems have similar tools  PHP Web hosting E-mail spam Stopping e-mail abuse MySQL GameFAQs BitTorrent Spam (electronic) Uploading and downloading Blog TikiWiki LiveJournal Internet pornography Perl Gmail Neopets Web design 4chan XOOPS Everything2 Managed learning environment Ajax (programming) Xanga PHP-Nuke CPAN Website Linux Newsgroup Internet fraud Spamdexing Web page Wikipedia Blogger Search engine Second Life Typo3 Search engine optimization Scoop (software) Google Video Captcha Webcomic Web application Wikimedia Commons LAMP (software bundle) The Internet Movie Database File Transfer Protocol MediaWiki MySpace PlayStation Portable Bulletin board system Midgard (software) VBulletin Google HyperCard Cross site scripting 2channel DeviantART Podcasting Open Directory Project Kazaa Photo sharing Internet Bliki WordPress Vlog LaTeX E-mail Link spam PostNuke Joomla!

vb net regex code to be able to find the string between h and h tags and write over it what i am trying to do is figure out the regex code needed to find the text between h and h tags so that i can extract it and write over it so what i think would happen is that i would find the h tag which could also be h aparently and then extract that text just in case i need it later and then be able to put text after this tag from a variable and have it be input before the h tag which could also be h or h even any idea of the regex code as well as the class needed to do this in vb net here is what i have dim alltext as string filereader readtoend dim holdtext as match dim theregexpattern as string h s dim aregex as new regex theregexpattern holdtext aregex match alltext i unfortunatly can not get anything bigger than the h tag i want to get the text between the two tags and replace it notice i have a in the regex but it is not picking up any of the characters between the two tags thanks i have been trying to figure out how to get the text between the tags and so i tried but that doesn't even work for the text after the first tag i realize i don't have the second tag's regex in the code i have been trying to do it step by step but i can't even get a h hello world found i keep getting an string when i try and add the furthermore once i can do this perhaps i am even going in the wrong direction as i just want to replace what is in between the tags with stuff that i have from a string variable i have been doing much research on regex but am still not sure how to do this that is to just replace the text in between the two tags any ideas especially examples in this case as i just seem to be doing something wrong any help is much appreciated thanks brian well i hope in vb net there is the equivalent of mid or mid in all versions of basic and excel and othe spreadsheets mid typically takes a beginning character postion and a number of characters like mid str beg num if the count is left off most return from the beg char to the end otherwise you have to fudge using the len of str so to find the beginning for mid you need something like instr which looks like c instr str str where c is the first position of str in str like if instr abcde cd you would get instr usually has an optional start search position like c first str str to save using mid one nice difference is that instr keeps the character count so if c instr abcdeab ab it returns the absolute location in the string not the relative position in your case what you want to do in my opinion is to clean the source to get rid of h etc so you are dealing with h then you would do something like this c instr source h ' gets the location of beginning if c then c instr source h if c and c c then holdstr mid source c c c ' pull out text between parts adding length of h to c and subtracting to get length allowing for length of h source mid source c newtext mid source c ' or mid source c len source c ' put new text between ends of old text in source else flag notfound endif  ASP.NET Ajax (programming) PHP Web server HTML Server-side scripting HyperText Transfer Protocol Application service provider Microsoft .NET Website Uniform Resource Locator SharpDevelop World Wide Web Digest access authentication Unicode and HTML Web design Web application Character encodings in HTML Visual Basic .NET Mono development platform Visual Basic Mozilla Firefox Macromedia Dreamweaver Wget JADE programming language Mozilla Application Suite Wiki Windows Server 2003 Captcha GameFAQs Internet Spaghetti code Java Servlet BASIC programming language JavaServer Pages Domain name JScript .NET Web page Nemerle Goto (command) HTML element Cross site scripting Mod python Hello world program HTTP cookie Quake III Arena Uniform Resource Identifier Web browser Macromedia C Sharp Domain Name System Streaming media Jabber Morning Musume Apache HTTP Server Netscape Navigator Visual Studio .NET Quotation mark ColdFusion Phishing HP BASIC for OpenVMS ASCII art Transclusion Blue Cheer Massimo Ellul Web hosting Kuzari Fictional websites in Doctor Who MIME Control flow User agent Textile (markup language) Simple Mail Transfer Protocol F Sharp programming language Cascading Style Sheets Object-oriented programming 400 (number) MSN Messenger Volleyball Serpent Society Slash (punctuation) Antidepressant Remote procedure call Wireless Application Protocol Web analytics ADO Federal Standard 1037C Virtual hosting Nokia Lotus Notes Callback (computer science) Application server Gopher protocol Gmail Nicomachean Ethics Web traffic TOC protocol MPEG-4 Representational State Transfer BZFlag

is c better than java lately i have been getting fairly good at c programming with the help of about thousand online tutorials i chose c because it is a compiled language i heard it was portable assembly from a few good sources and you have a lot of control over the computer without the major difficulty of assembly code i heard it ran quite fast once compiled both python and java are interpretted and my th grade training told me 'slow as hell' but for kicks i did a search for c vs java and most websites have been saying java is better i dont really want to learn java i became morally opposed to it when it was able to crash my computer and my blackberry but if it is a much better language would it behoove me not to learn it i actually already know c i simply wanted to know if its really necesarry i ever learn java in the next lets say years c and java both have their good points and their bad points java might be a little slower than c because as you say it is interpreted but i don't think you or any other human can see the difference except for the slow initial load once loaded java programs execute lightning fast on my computer a benchmark program of course could detect that a c program does indeed execute faster java is easier to learn than c even though they both have a very similar syntax c is portable to more systems than java is because all platforms don't support java although more and more are picking it up i personally prefer java but your mileage might vary  Macromedia Flash OpenOffice.org C plus plus Portable Document Format PostScript Perl Visual Basic OpenDocument Objective-C Java programming language C programming language Web template Adobe Photoshop Adobe Systems TeX TrueType PHP Scalable Vector Graphics Ebook Object-oriented programming JavaScript C Sharp IPod Unicode Opera (web browser) ColdFusion WordPerfect XSL Transformations Windows Vista Nintendo DS Adobe Illustrator Flash memory String (computer science) Mach kernel XForms StarOffice Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Standard Template Library Computer virus Digital photography USB flash drive OpenType Mozilla Firefox Programming language Commodore 64 GIF Xbox 360 BASIC programming language Expert system BIOS Something Awful Common Unix Printing System Linspire Warez Web page HTML M16 (rifle) Polymorphism (computer science) Microsoft Office Generic programming Compiler optimization Apple typography Pretty Good Privacy Dance Dance Revolution BitTorrent Comparison of generics to templates Function object PowerPC Killian documents Casting Read-only memory Podcasting Copyright infringement of software StepMania Drill bit Plugin PIC microcontroller Microsoft .NET Sharp Zaurus Linux Microsoft JADE programming language Version Spline (mathematics) Theory of conduct Ajax (programming) Explosive material Windows 3.x 2D computer graphics Name mangling SWF Software engineering Pharmaceutical company Logo programming language LaTeX PLATO IBM PC compatible Software cracking Embedded system

secure ftp error error ef receiving sftp packet anyone have thots about resolving this error i have an app which uses ws ftp pro sdk for secure ftp i'm getting this error server has disconnected for reason ssh disconnect protocol error data exceeds window size error ef receiving sftp packet googleing produces alot of questions but no answers as well as more detail on the error message which doesn't fit here experts exchange com suposubly has an answer they want me to pay big bugs for any help would be lovely thanks cez yea i see what you mean about trying to find more info on this one thing that happens to encrypted data is that it can get bigger this usually isn't a big deal because disk space is cheap but it matters more when you are transmitting it like with secure ftp my best guess is that the encrypted data is encrypting to a particular block size which is larger than the mtu you might not be able to change the mtu of your network but you could change what the mtu of your computer we used to do this with computers that use vpn kind of like secure ftp we would tell the computer to set mtu to while we knew is what could be transmitted when the computer added the encryption headers on top of the it was still under and the packets transmitted full search for change mtu for your operating system also see if there are some switches to force this program to use smaller packets that might help good luck  Inkscape Windows XP PNG Mozilla Firefox EIA-708 Microsoft Paint IPod Macromedia Flash Vitreous enamel Windows 2000 RGB color model GIF Kazaa 2D computer graphics KDE Mouse (computing) Multiple document interface International Phonetic Alphabet Minesweeper (computer game) Palm OS Taskbar Gradient HTTP cookie Screenshot Windows Vista ImageMagick Canal lock Pop-up ad Macromedia Fireworks Image file formats Macintosh Finder Hello world program Object Desktop Conjugate gradient method Adobe Photoshop Mac OS X Blue screen of death Gmail The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) SAS System Optical spectrum Windows Picture and Fax Viewer The Parting of the Ways Mozilla Application Suite Halo: Combat Evolved Stoma E-mail spam Avalanche Colorist DVD GIMP Library DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Transparency (optics) Duct tape Blogger Graphics tablet Photography Sega Saturn S3 Texture Compression Double-click (computing) Watercolor painting Stopping e-mail abuse Window Finale notation program Visual Basic .NET Plan 9 (operating system) Messaging spam Hong Kong Central Library Poker jargon Delphi programming language Apple Macintosh Edge detection Hydraulic head (hydrology) Microsoft .NET Mac OS X v10.4 Gramophone record X Window System Windows Installer Expos__ (Mac OS X) Portable Document Format Steam engine Opera (web browser) DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Tai shogi Halo 2 Street-Legal Spyware Dodge Charger Elevator Adobe Illustrator Leica PC Engine Window Maker Glass Apostrophe (mark) Railway signalling Film

budding graphic artist need medium i have a question for all the graphic artists out there are there any other good free graphic design programs out there besides blender and povray i'd appreciate a list of other programs i want to be able to use it when my imagination wants to you know a spur of the moment kind of program where i can just design without hassle is there any intuitive programs out there like that and i would appreciate knowing this as well what's the best graphic design medium out there is it blender or is there one that's even better than blender i still mean for free i don't care how technical it is i just want to learn a deep yet intuitive design program that's similar to blender but has even more options and is there a program out there that converts between common graphic design programs i'd appreciate that too is racer's converter able to convert blender d files to its native format i was using another program before but heard that blender was one of the best inkscape org is a free vector based graphic design program and gimp is a free photoshop like program gimp org  Spyware Internet Explorer Component Object Model Microsoft .NET NTFS Windows 2000 Mozilla Application Suite Outlook Express NPAPI Microsoft Object Desktop Domain Name System MDAC MSN Messenger Windows Vista Mozilla Firefox Wiki Novell NetWare Comparison of web browsers Windows Server 2003 Internet Explorer for Mac Dialer File system Rootkit Web application Visual Basic Windows Explorer ITunes X Window System Ajax (programming) Computer virus Screensaver Pretty Good Privacy Microsoft Windows Enterprise content management Perl Microsoft Office Whois Proxy server Microsoft Excel Internet Relay Chat Buffer overflow Netscape Communications Corporation AmigaOS PHP NX bit Browser Helper Object NetCaptor Web browser PNG Stopping e-mail abuse Intranet Netscape Browser Browser wars Filename extension Mouse (computing) Virtual memory Cross site scripting Screenshot Windows API Gecko (layout engine) FidoNet Control Panel (Windows) System 7 (Macintosh) GameFAQs Skype File Allocation Table Linux distribution Wget USB flash drive Dynamic-Link Library Off By One CPU cache Master Control Program Gmail Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Portable Document Format Newsgroup AOL Instant Messenger TeX Web page Library (computer science) Btrieve Streaming media Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Federal Standard 1037C HTTP cookie Mac OS X v10.4 Java programming language Plame affair Opera (web browser) Transmission Control Protocol Common Unix Printing System Comparison of file systems Embedded system IPod ADO Computer security

how do you use a c program to execute another program with a parameter variable i need a program to execute a simulation program a specific number of times each time the simulation should be slightly different so i created a variable that makes the appropriate changes how can i make a program both run the simulation and specify the parameter i can also change the simulation if i have to actually the whole reason i have to do this is because the simulation can't free all of its memory unless it closes instead is there a way to free all memory except for the variable and start over that would have the same effect thanks well actually i didn't write the code to start with i'm just working with it and the person who wrote it has disappeared off the face of the earth but how do you call a program with arguments that's what i can't figure out what's the actual procedure by the way i'm using visual c on windows as foolish as it is how can i make a program both run the simulation and specify the parameter take advantage of the command line arguments that is when calling a program you can also give it arguments these arguments are accessible from main's definition int main int argc char argv actually the whole reason i have to do this is because the simulation can't free all of its memory unless it closes which suggests really bad code and program design so to deal with bad code and inefficiencies your idea is to repeatedly open and close the program another layer of inefficiency does this sound ok to you instead is there a way to free all memory except for the variable and start over the big question is how is this memory being allocated in the first place and why are you unable to control when it is deallocated edit well as i said the big ugly hack here is to use command line arguments that you can pass into a program so if you have a third party program to control create a controlling program that repeatedly calls it modifying the arguments as needed calling the commands is os specific and you haven't mentioned which one you are on in any case linux has a set of commands to spawn other processes as does the windows api look at createprocess in msdn you'll have to google to find out what works on your os my points about this being inefficient still remain but it's an option the other one is to refactor the code and clean it up so memory isn't leaking everywhere generally speaking if you see a lot of new and delete left and right without any sense of good memory management it's a lot of terrible code i don't know what you're working with so you'll have to make a few judgement calls and see whether a hack cuts it or something more involved is worth it  Macromedia Dreamweaver Opera (web browser) Web browser Lotus Notes Web design System/36 Windows XP Atari 8-bit family System/34 Windows 2000 Mozilla Firefox AmigaOS HyperText Transfer Protocol Game controller Blue screen of death Blender (software) Microsoft Windows Apple II family Enlightenment (X window manager) Plan 9 (operating system) Secure Shell System 7 (Macintosh) Embedded system Mozilla Application Suite Windows Vista Apple Macintosh PC Engine IMac Windows Mobile Uniform Resource Locator Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis HTTP cookie Windows 3.x MSN Messenger Sega Dreamcast History of Microsoft Windows Windows Server 2003 Netscape Navigator Emacs Cascading Style Sheets Window Maker Wi-Fi Internet Explorer for Mac PowerBook Macromedia Flash Apple IIGS Server Mac OS X v10.4 Xbox 360 WordStar Apple typography ATI Technologies Commodore PET Apple Computer Apache HTTP Server Video Graphics Array Portable Document Format Nintendo DS Internet Relay Chat Palm OS OpenOffice.org Mouse (computing) Wget Radeon BlackBerry ASP.NET Website MDAC Amstrad CPC Files-11 Cangjie method Commodore 64 Atari ST Microsoft Screenshot Finale notation program XML Screensaver BBC Master X Window System Windows Presentation Foundation Domain Name System C plus plus Handheld game console Minesweeper (computer game) Mac OS X AppleTalk ColdFusion Object Desktop Oscilloscope Commodore 128 Resident Evil (video game) Adobe Illustrator Resident Evil 2 VME Virtual Network Computing Sega Saturn Internet Explorer

c programming language help is it possible in c to play audio music by the help of a function if not i want to embed music in my game how shall i do that not the c sound function real music how to open a software by the help of c that is if i want to make a program with a help option and when its clicked on it opens internet explorer how to call a program execution if the above is possible then how to embed a address like if i hit h then the help comes into action and opens internet explorer and goes to the site mmysite how to insert graphics in c by graphics i mean pictures like from mypictures folder i know how to make mouse appear in c but the problem is i cannot understand how is the mouse initialized i have the code from net tried referring books but its really confusing none has the topic like initializing mouse in c so any site which explain how to and the concept behind it explain all the terms used sites like prog heaven etc i know but a direct link you need to understand that c is a system level language it doesn't provide an enormous platform itself that can do everything if that's what you want learn c and use the net framework or java and its platform play audio music by the help of a function if not i want to embed music in my game how shall i do that you need to use an os specific library that can handle audio take a look at fmod or bass they are libraries that can handle common audio formats otherwise you'll have to work with the base audio libraries on the system directsound etc and the decoders for the audio format mp library aac whatever how to open a software by the help of c that is if i want to make a program with a help option and when its clicked on it opens internet explorer this is also os specific the win api has functions that can execute other programs look at http msdn microsoft com en us library ms aspx for example that's just what the windows api has other libraries may have this under different names under unices you'll want to look at the spawn functions how to insert graphics in c by graphics i mean pictures like from mypictures folder inserting graphics you'll want to find a convenient library that handles all the different image formats some of them are higher level libraries that display them directly or whatever in any case you'll have to look around and i have no idea what you mean by making a mouse appear  IBM PC compatible Computer Social rule Computer and video games Application-specific integrated circuit Video game developer Game programming W.

how to make a animated gif how do you make a animated gif there are various programs to do this i use fireworks basically what you do is combined multiple frames together a frame is a still image when you add the multiple frames together each with a slight variation you get an animated image gif try it with something simple like with a circle moving about the image think of it sort of like those flip books people have that with each page the image moves a lil bit so when you flip all the pages in order it looks like the image is moving now actually making the animated gif depends on the program you use in fireworks you can add frames to an image i usually just cut and paste the previous frame add it to the new frame and alter the positioning to the way i want or the image itself then export wizard it as an animated gif i'm sure theres many programs that will make the animated gif for you if you provide the frames for free ones i'd suggest http download com  C plus plus Buffer overflow Pointer C syntax C programming language Printf Associative array Hello world program D programming language Const correctness Quicksort Generic programming Stack-smashing protection Virtual method table Cyclone programming language ALGOL 68 Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm Variable Objective-C Comparison of generics to templates Name mangling Linked list Bogosort Levenshtein distance PL/SQL Brainfuck MUMPS Normal distribution Lookup table Malloc Heapsort Berkeley sockets Infinity AS/400 Command Language Path integral formulation Function object 0 (number) Tensor product Information entropy One Year War Iterator Subroutine Delta encoding Fundamental theorem of calculus Ordinary differential equation Vector field Merge algorithm Stupid sort Object lifetime Identical particles Inline expansion Header file Exception handling Scope (programming) Ocaml Green's function String (computer science) Callback (computer science) Radix sort Gray code Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Aspect-oriented programming Reference (C Plus Plus) Programming style Integration by parts Bc programming language Icon programming language Indent style Finite field arithmetic Lazy evaluation Array X86 assembly language Perl 6 Riemann integral Lebesgue integration Discrete Fourier transform Heat equation Immutable object Theta function Garbage collection (computer science) Tensor Standard ML Primitive type Self-adjoint operator Clifford algebra Continuous function (topology) Fourier series Digital photography Bayes' theorem Chinese character Noether's theorem Perl Python programming language Multiple integral Dirac delta function Time signature Char Aznable Kolmogorov complexity Path integral Arabic alphabet

when creating a website why does it appear different in ie than firefox so i created a pretty basic website for my company for a new add campaign html host ftp publish and you're done i've got one mp and pdfs linked on the site but here is my curiosity i created with nvu and published all while creating editing in mozilla firefox the site looks crisp and perfect in mozilla but when somebody opens the url in internet explorer the link sizes are all different the fonts are different sizes etc can somebody with experience shed some light on this for me i'm stumped thanks most web sites are designed for ie so mostly when i view them with firefox they look slightly odd and some bits don't work because the website is using microsoft proprietary html extensions there's nothing like a standard and unfortunately html is nothing like a standard or maybe that should be microsoft's implementation of html is nothing like the same standard that mozilla's implementation of html follows they obey the html pragmas in slightly different ways or don't obey them use different defaults for font etc so the end result is screens that can look very different viewed in ie or firefox getting sites that look the same in the two is a case of using the common html commands only and specifying everything explicitly no relying on the default values plus of course trial and error or checking which browser and offering different code for the two browsers if you want the ultimate in not the same look there are some microsoft pages where the links just don't work in some non microsoft browsers the ones i came up against were typically the 'download' button which just didn't appear on screen for netscape  Serialization XML JavaScript Object-SQL mapping Objective-C Document Type Definition Macromedia Flash Self programming language AppleScript Java API for XML Processing XML Signature Object-oriented programming C programming language Microsoft .NET File format Ajax (programming) Common Unix Printing System CPU cache Associative array MDAC Markup language Translation memory Java programming language Enterprise content management Enterprise JavaBeans OpenDocument XMLHTTP XSL Transformations JSON Bluetooth Scalable Vector Graphics Component Object Model

using multiple css sheets to provide skinning of a website how what's the simplest way to use multiple style sheets to change the appearance of a website and it's logos etc based an option chosen by the visitor from a drop down selection box an example is http www vcdquality com but they use javascript to load another style which i'd rather stay away from if possible is there a way to do this purely in html without something as crude as having multiple copies of my pages with a different reference to each style sheet to create each 'skin' any links and information are welcomed oh and by links i mean specific links to a page that deals with what i'm asking rather than a generic site i've been there done that and found nothing which is why i'm asking here billyzeke your referral link spam isn't welcome expect yahoo to remove it once their support team reads my abuse report jake cigar i was actually just looking at csszengarden this very second and other sites that seem to write the location of the css file into the page from the url having never had any dealings with cgi or whatever though i'm unsure how it's done are there specific server requirements for running cgi scripts but yeah if you could help me out with a cgi script for loading the css file i'd be eternally greatful as far as i know there's no way of of stealing cgi scripts from sites is there there are a number of ways to do that in html server side scripting but all require a postback specifically they choose the item from the dropdown then press a submit button the problem you face with an html only change is that you can't make it apply beyond the current request in other words reloading the page makes the selection revert to default going to another page causes a revert to default the way javascript and server side scripting gets past that is by sending a cookie that stores the current css choice that said you can set up a simple html form with a get method that sends the page back to itself for example suppose this is index html form method get id myform name myform action index html select name css option value css txt style option option value css txt style option option value css txt style option select input type submit name submit id submit value change style form save your css as text files in the head section declare a style element style type text css style and then add this server side include code between the opening and ending tags include virtual query string unescaped the above assumes the css text files are in the same directory as the the index html file remove the spaces before the underscores i had to add them due to yahoo 's line truncation so your final style call would be like this style type text css if query string unescaped css css txt include virtual css txt end if if query string unescaped css css txt include virtual css txt end if if query string unescaped css css txt include virtual css txt end if style note that this is not very secure anyone can mod the query string doesn't have a default value and again won't hold on postback or a new page but it kind of does what you want  Macromedia Flash HyperText Transfer Protocol PNG HTML PHP Scalable Vector Graphics Website Web page Macromedia Shockwave ActionScript Uniform Resource Locator Macromedia Ajax (programming) World Wide Web Web server Opera (web browser) Web design Reverse engineering Warez BitTorrent Dance Dance Revolution XSL Transformations Web template ICalendar Macromedia Flex Screenshot Casting JavaServer Pages Goatse.cx Computer graphics Common Unix Printing System Phishing Web crawler Adobe Photoshop ColdFusion Gmail Wiki OpenOffice.org Adobe Illustrator CPAN Labour economics JavaScript HTML element Flash memory XML Adobe Systems Authorware Portable Document Format Search engine optimization Domain Name System Prank flash Streaming media OpenDocument ImageMagick Macromedia Dreamweaver Flash (comics) Cross site scripting Windows 2000 Ebook Obfuscated code Blog HyperCard Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 2D computer graphics Resource Description Framework PHP-Nuke Compiler TOC protocol Windows Vista HTTP cookie Copy protection Transport Layer Security WebDAV Representational State Transfer Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends Files-11 IPod Port numbers Macromedia Director DVD PostScript C plus plus Lotus Notes Web traffic Digital rights management Cascading Style Sheets Internet censorship in mainland China Nintendo DS Enigma machine LaTeX SOAP Wget Unix JSON Version Morse Code Copyright law of the United Kingdom

how are the interfaces in various applications made i wanted to know which language or software are used to make g u i graphic user interface and how to make a good interface using c and c programming thanx there are loads of languages that can be used when making user interfaces if you're wanting to give it a go take a look at microsoft's express editions they're free downloads targeted at the hobbyist or student various managed languages include visual basic c c and j i think each edition has loads of help and walk thru's for starting off if you're going to get one of them possibly think about c since at the moment there is a lot of documentation for that vb too but its very verbose as a language these make it seriously simple to create desktop and web with visual web developer using either vb or c apps using drag and drop to put buttons textboxes etc etc in to an application  Hello world program C syntax Name mangling Python programming language C preprocessor ALGOL 68 PHP XML HyperText Transfer Protocol Associative array Linked list JavaScript Pointer Common Lisp Uniform Resource Identifier Printf JavaServer Pages D programming language Cross site scripting MUMPS Forth programming language C Sharp Prolog Inetd Thread (computer science) HTML element World Wide Web Variable Perl AmigaOS Halting problem XSL Transformations String (computer science) Quicksort Uniform Resource Locator Wget Tcl Boost library Obfuscated code File format Header file Common Unix Printing System Unicode and HTML Quantum computer PL/SQL Central processing unit Character encodings in HTML Complexity classes P and NP 64-bit X86 assembly language MD5 Comparison of generics to templates Base64 Pipeline (Unix) Lexical analysis Portable Document Format HTML Kolmogorov complexity Web server Domain Name System MDAC Macromedia Flash Scheme programming language Filename extension Exception handling Cyclone programming language Namespace (computer science) OpenDocument MIME Quotation mark Visual Basic Lotus Notes Jackson Structured Programming Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition Generic programming VHSIC hardware description language UTF-8 Ellipsis Enterprise content management Visitor pattern AWK programming language Compiler optimization Class (computer science) Space character ARM architecture Emacs Immutable object Delta encoding Scalable Vector Graphics

how do i apply a transparent background in paint shop pro its driving me mad i have a logo and i just want to get rid of the white square around it so just keeping the text and logo i know there must be a straightforward way to do it can anyone help i'm using jasc paint shop pro i believe yes thats really helpful thanks i'm actually getting somewhere but i do think that the quality looks a bit dodgy when i save it as a gif is there a way of just extracting the text so in effect there is no background at all currently the only image format options that support transparent backgrounds are gif or png files due to the myriad of browsers being used and the smaller file size i'd recommend saving your image as a gif it is one of the most commonly used image files to save a psp file with a transparent background as a transparent gif in paint shop pro use the gif optimizer file export gif optimizer click on the transparency tab and select 'existing image or layer transparency' click 'ok' name and save your transparent gif edit yes the quality does diminish in many images because gifs are limited to display in only colors sorry if i misunderstood your original question i hope i am correctly thinking that you want to remove a current background from your image see if any of these 'removing background' tutorials written for psp and earlier willl help you http www jaychantell com pspbackground htm http www snowgirldesigns com bgrtut html http graphicssoft about com od paintshoppro l blremovebackg htm http www hypergurl com unwanted html http www bingoware com cutouts here's a tutorial about how to create an image and export as a transparent png in psp http www ehow com how make png paintshop html note web browsers older than internet explorer do not support alpha channel transparency good luck  Visual Basic Visual Basic .NET BASIC programming language C Sharp Object-oriented programming Microsoft .NET C plus plus Thread (computer science) JScript .NET JavaScript Extreme Programming Lisp programming language Game programmer Esperanto as an international language Component Object Model HyperCard Ajax (programming) Python programming language Regular expression Java platform Volleyball ASP.NET C programming language Microsoft Excel Programming language Backgammon Eiffel programming language AS/400 Aspect-oriented programming XML Second language acquisition Virtual machine Widget toolkit Neuro-linguistic programming Philosophy of language Forth programming language PHP Ada programming language ZX Spectrum Sun Microsystems Obfuscated code Embedded system GIMP Toolkit Comment Non-native pronunciations of English OpenOffice.org Turing machine OpenGL Gross domestic product History of science Control flow Dyslexia Language ALGOL 68 Standard Widget Toolkit Microsoft Visual Studio .NET Exception handling G__del's incompleteness theorem Cognitive science Computer programming Symbian OS Shogi Compiler Packages in Java Scripting language String (computer science) Objective-C AmigaOS Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Aikido Byte-code Java (island) Hexadecimal Hello world program Biblical inerrancy Windows 2000 Atari 8-bit family Microsoft Visual Studio Lie Hungarian language LaTeX German language John Titor Expert system OS/2 Linked list Japanese language Emacs French language Game programming Depreciation 0 (number) Windows Vista JADE programming language Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition ITunes X Window System

how do i check if two string variables in php contain the exact same strings i'm evaluating an if statement that checks if one string equals another i tried to do if string string but i don't know if that is how you compare strings another thing to note is that i'm using the get variable i don't know if that changes anything here is what it looks like if get prim title thanks for the help technically speaking i believe your code will work but not for all cases unfortunately and it isn't safe code in my opinion since it can be fooled by passing a boolean see here for type comparisons http us php net manual en types comparisons php best practice is to verify their type i e be certain you have a string then the best thing to do would be use strcmp as shown here http us php net manual en function strcmp php that is the case sensitive version of the previous poster's comment which is case insensitive  Visual Basic BASIC programming language Microsoft Developer Network Ajax (programming) C Sharp Windows Vista Python programming language MDAC Apache HTTP Server Microsoft Foundation Classes ASP.NET Microsoft HyperText Transfer Protocol Windows API Microsoft .NET XML Visual C Plus Plus Emacs Visual Basic .NET DirectX LaTeX Microsoft Excel Spyware Dynamic-Link Library QBasic Microsoft Access PHP Proxy server HyperCard REALbasic Delphi programming language Microsoft Jet Database Engine Visual SourceSafe OpenGL Forth programming language Microsoft Visual Studio Vim (text editor) SOAP HTML QuickBASIC Visual FoxPro Web browser XMLHTTP Wireless Application Protocol Microsoft Office SharePoint Portal Server Podcasting Microsoft PowerPoint Browser Helper Object Scalable Vector Graphics Ada programming language Windows XP C plus plus HTTP cookie Microsoft BASIC Internet Information Services Regular expression ADO.NET IntelliSense Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition Pixel art Bash Visual Basic for Applications Web service WebDAV Component Object Model Lotus Notes Visual programming language NTFS JavaScript Categorical list of programming languages Integrated development environment VoiceXML Operating system Generic programming Unreal Tournament 2004 BPEL Literae Humaniores Windows 2000 Java Servlet Gymnasium (Denmark) Chess TeX ITunes Microsoft Windows Website Hello world program Wget Distributed component object model Microsoft Virtual PC Oracle database ImageMagick Mozilla Firefox Visual effects Fractal Windows CE Document Object Model Sitar StarOffice Common Unix Printing System Microsoft Word

what's the best free c complier one that has a nice gui can make simple programs for vista thanks i just want a complier for messing around and trying to learn a bit more c on my own visual studio express it is free it includes sql server c c visual basic vb net visual web developer http msdn microsoft com en us express aa aspx the beta version is here http msdn microsoft com en us express default aspx ok let me spew my opinion microsoft was founded by bill gates he wrote an implementation of the basic language i don't know if you remenber writing code like go sub for x to y go sub next x bill gates was language and development centric now bill is stepping down aside business analysts look at the numbers and see that windows and office is their biggest money maker languages such as vb or vc probably brought in less than of their revenue linux and open source came into the picture and there is a definate alternate to windows for servers the cost to get into developing is an issue as to the platform that developers will develop to if it costs money to get the tools to develop for one platform and it costs no money to develop for another platform there will be more developers developing for the platform that it does not cost any money to start developing in developers are the people that specify the target platform that the system will run on if the developers pick linux as the target system that is what they will sell to the end users i am sure that microsoft wants the developers to pick windows the next big trend for applications is to be web enabled or just be a web based apllication the interface to allow links to every other system in the world is just too efficient to use so microsoft needs to not loose their market to the linux apache mysql server market which costs no money for developers to get into how do they do it microsoft takes their development software and makes it free just like linux gcc apache perl php they want to sell operating systems for all of those servers they have made the development environment so advanced that nothing compares they have billions to spend in research and development and they have spent their money well they have also developed the net framework that is designed to best of practice standards sun has developed java and its virtual machine it is too strictly licensed and controlled by sun for it to eventually win out the net framwork is simular to java but it compiles into psuedo code when developed and compliles into executable code on the target machine when it is installed and run for the first time this allows the compiler on the target machine to look at the system and add all of the compiler options specific to the cpu on the production machine so forget the linux unix vs windows wars i am a unix linux die hard i have come to the realization that the new tools from microsoft are just too good to ignore microsoft does not want to loose the operating system market it also does not want to loose the office sales to protect those sales it is giving away the development environments which probably amount to less then of their total sales to ensure that developers will devlop targeting windows the cost of windows can just be added to the total cost of the project which is paid for by the customer windows is less complicated to manage for the average person than a unix linux based os unix linux systems may be more efficient but cpus have become so fast that it is almost not even an issue anymore especially if the software on the unix linux based system is running in java as in java server pages and the software on the windows environment is based on net ok i spewed  Visual Basic Microsoft Office Microsoft Windows AmigaOS Windows XP OpenOffice.org Ajax

in your own words how would define high availability as it applies to mission critical applications high availabilty generally is implemented with redundancy for example an application can be running on a cluster of servers if any one of the servers goes down the remaining servers in the cluster take over and the user does not notice raid arrays are generally used with ha clusters so that if a drive goes bad the other drives in the array take over and the user does not notice networks and firewalls can be configured with redundant network paths so that if a single network component goes down the user does not notice many high availability solutions also keep statistics as to how long it took for a particular task to complete or fail or for a network connection to occur or fail these systems determine the fastest route to the fastest server and use that route server to perform the task by default the server network connection that fails is slower so it never gets picked this type of solution also does automatic load balancing because that fastest path is always used and the least used resource is generally faster  Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Community college Graduate school Second language acquisition German language Jewish studies Education in Hong Kong Perl SQL Literacy PLATO MySQL Otterbein College Supply and demand Managed learning environment Microsoft SQL Server Speed reading Education in Singapore GED Scientology beliefs and practices English language Education Past teachings of Prem Rawat Lisp programming language Education in Malaysia Education in Portugal Bah__'__ Faith and Education Philosophy Athabasca University Education in Australia Microsoft Access Open University (Netherlands) University of Pretoria Education in India Reiki Game programmer Victor Cousin Distance education Deconstruction Kwantlen University College Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act MDAC Study abroad Adult education Database Air Education and Training Command American and British English differences American University Rudolf Hermann Lotze Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Seneca College Esperanto as an international language Medical school Higher education in Japan Heidelberg College Tuition University of Massachusetts Amherst Alternative medicine Philosophy of language Insurance Cross site scripting Anti-intellectualism College Requirements analysis Trinity College, Dublin George Lakoff Thread (computer science) Oracle database Guide for the Perplexed Open access Advanced Placement Program Education in Romania York University Postmodernism Web design Current teachings of Prem Rawat Secondary education in Japan Object database Education in Albania XML Cooperative education Simplified Chinese character Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Finnish language Robert Hutchins Microsoft Logic Database management system Connecticut College Caulfield Grammar School University of Bristol Education in France University of Houston Hungarian language Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity IB Diploma Programme Cantonese (linguistics)

md hash mapping unique input bit to unique output bit will the md hash function always return a unique hash given that input is unique each time and or less bits for example will all numbers return a unique md hash or do they lap over at some points i dont just want a yes no but some proof website links please the md algorithm will theoretically create collisions for two unique inputs but i would suspect that at bits the probability of it would be low the wikipedia entry for md http en wikipedia org wiki md vulnerability suggests collisions are easily generated but it fails to state that the only practical way to collide two hashes is to know the same prefix which is unlikely in the case of passwords although one could dictionary brute force attack a dataset of hashes in an effort to create collisions and thus crack the hash that's probably more work than many crackers would care to invest  Objective-C Mozilla Firefox C programming language Macromedia Flash MAME C plus plus Header file Xcode Linux Unicode NPAPI Visual Basic AmigaOS Wget BZFlag MDAC Visual Basic .NET Unix HTML element C syntax OpenOffice.org C Sharp Java programming language Linux kernel Mozilla Application Suite EMule Microsoft Mach kernel Comparison of generics to templates Mac OS X Forth programming language PHP Pretty Good Privacy Smalltalk Extreme Programming Internet Relay Chat PaX Spyware JavaServer Pages Opera (web browser) Rational Unified Process Microsoft .NET SAS System Atari 8-bit family BASIC programming language Computer virus Open-source software Compiler optimization Gnutella Software testing Microsoft Windows APL programming language Windows Vista Musical Instrument Digital Interface Windows API X86 assembly language Delphi programming language IPsec RISC Spring operating system C preprocessor ALGOL 68 Computer Common Unix Printing System Debugging Podcasting Plan 9 (operating system) International Phonetic Alphabet IPod OpenDocument Concurrent Versions System Pointer Windows XP Source code Open source culture Netscape Communications Corporation ITunes Emacs Symbian OS Software engineering AppleScript GNU General Public License Ordinary differential equation Microsoft Office Peer-to-peer Programming language Product Lifecycle Management DirectShow Cocoa (API) Perl Copyleft Patch (computing) Linspire File sharing Compiler

hiding entire page in css then printing something hi i want to make it so that when a page displays i can add css coding in there that will hide the entire page except for a line of text i want to display instead for example a user loads a page and instead of what is supposed to be displayed it displays a line of text that i want on there how would i go about doing that thanks simple put a div element around the elements of the page you want to hide and give it a style of display none this will even remove the rendering box from the page so it doesn't even look like there's something missing however the user can still see the content if they view the page source to hide the content completely you would need to use a server side language like php that the client has no access to  MDAC Database SQL Visual Basic Microsoft Jet Database Engine Isolation (computer science) Database management system Flat file database C syntax SAS System System/36 MUMPS Relational algebra ADO.NET Tcl Perl Ajax (programming) CPU cache PostgreSQL C programming language Domain Name System PHP System/34 Hello world program ALGOL 68 Abstraction (computer science) Prolog Hash table C Sharp Web crawler Join (SQL) Halting problem Python programming language ADO JavaScript Dynamic random access memory Index (database) BASIC programming language Read-copy-update Geographic information system SQL injection Metadata Whois MySQL Nemerle Associative array Control flow Microsoft .NET Punch card Object-SQL mapping Unicode Computer File Allocation Table Quantum computer Database normalization IP Multimedia Subsystem RFID Compact disc Btrieve C plus plus Lisp programming language Objective-C Atari 8-bit family Enterprise content management Tuple relational calculus XML HP BASIC for OpenVMS Astrophysics Data System Forth programming language Cocoa (API) Redundant array of independent disks Bloom filter Microsoft Access Component Object Model Common Unix Printing System Icon programming language COMMAND.COM Master Control Program Transposition cipher Burrows-Wheeler transform RS-232 OpenDocument Orthogonal matrix Compiler optimization On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences AWK programming language Information Management System Array Relational model Gmail Internet Group Management Protocol Linked list Object-oriented programming Transmission Control Protocol Page table JADE programming language

need help adding something to my site ok first thank you for helping i always award best answer points so i please help me ok ok i have a web page on aol hometown and i want to add on were i can allow people to add there music to my site so other user can listen to there music so is there a html code to make this happen or what the best way to do this do i have to go to a second party site to host there songs if so which one please leave your ideas and let me know i will vote for best answer asap thanks hi i don't think this would be possible on aol hometown for two reasons first of all you only have mb of webspace which would probably only store about three or four songs at maximum the other reason is that in order to create an uploading tool you need to use a server side language such as php asp net perl etc that can take the file your user is sending to your website it's simple to put a file browser in a form on your page input type file id file but telling your web server to store the file requires that you have access to your server in a way that aol hometown doesn't allow if you were to try it on a professional web server where you had enough webspace you'd need a good web host and probably your own domain you could use file input code to access the file a server side language to post the file onto your web server when the user submits the song submission form and flash to list all of your files and play them back hope this answers your question  GIF Macromedia Flash PlayStation Portable Web page Quicksort PNG Beatmania IIDX IPod Mouse (computing) HTML element Common Unix Printing System Mozilla Firefox EMule Object Desktop QuickTime Speed of light Mozilla Application Suite System 7 (Macintosh) Floppy disk Gmail Musical Instrument Digital Interface Manual transmission Faster-than-light AmigaOS Screenshot Mandelbrot set Favicon Lossless data compression Traffic light Nintendo Revolution TGV Parachute MAME Oscilloscope Dance Dance Revolution Warcraft III P__li Computer virus Nuclear option (filibuster) Harmonica Prank flash Mac OS X v10.4 Recumbent bicycle Data compression Embedded system Image file formats CPU cache Film BZFlag Windows API Daigasso!

how do you make your own file extension i need to now how to make my own file type and my own extension to create a application that can read it to do something programmable file extensions hold no power over what is actually held in the file if you take an exe file and change it's name to txt you still can't read it if you change it back to exe it still runs as long as you didn't change it while it was a txt file extensions don't dictate what's in the file they just offer an easy way to have an idea what kind of information that data holds i've created my own extensions plenty of times if you're wanting to make some sort of document or data file where you double click the output file the file with your own extension and it opens in your reader application then that will take a bit more then just naming the file whatever you want you can associate an extension to a program manually right clicking the file and following a few steps programmatically which you'll have to look up it's different for every language or on installation depends on what you use to build the installation i know i didn't help much but that's because of the lack of specifics what i am telling you is that it's possible email me with specifics and i can probably help you out more  Web design Cascading Style Sheets Opera (web browser) Internet Explorer Ajax (programming) JavaScript Cross site scripting PHP HTML GameFAQs Mozilla Application Suite Mozilla Firefox Web browser XML World Wide Web ASP.NET HTML editor MDAC International Phonetic Alphabet Web page Wget Perl JavaServer Pages Macromedia Flash Microsoft Web application Search engine optimization Atari 8-bit family Forth programming language TikiWiki Internet Explorer for Mac Files-11 Dynamic HTML Windows Vista AmigaOS Virtual memory System/34 Hello world program NTFS Windows 2000 Gecko (layout engine) HyperText Transfer Protocol Obfuscated code Linux SHA hash functions Associative array ALGOL 68 Apple Macintosh Uniform Resource Locator Microsoft Jet Database Engine EIA-708 PostScript Lotus Notes PNG HyperCard System/36 Self programming language MSN Messenger Btrieve HTTP cookie Web crawler Library (computer science) Python programming language X86 TeX Windows API Screenshot Konfabulator Java programming language Extreme Programming Windows Presentation Foundation Comment XMLHTTP Fortran Tcl Windows XP Blue screen of death Wiki Apple II family X86 assembly language Domain Name System Geodesy Warez Bracket Aspect-oriented programming ICab Unicode Netscape Communications Corporation User agent Piccolo Junior Saga Minesweeper (computer game) Apollo Guidance Computer Beatmania IIDX MySQL Stairway Brainfuck Gmail

need explaination on arrays this is how it goes example short arr short i p t arr i p arr i t p p arr i t p i can explain them declares an array of shorts short arr declares a short and a pointer to a short short i p at this point arr is a pointer to the first of shorts arr is the first short arr is the second etc up to arr l is a short that is not initialized and p is a pointer to a short that is not initialized sets t to the l'th element in the array t arr i so if l then t will be assigned whatever value is first in the array sets p to the address of the l'th element p arr i equivalent to p arr l after this p will be the same place in memory as arr l if you change p arr l will change and vice versa sets t to the value of the short that p points to t p the final two statements are repeated in your question but i'm not sure what you are trying to do with them as written the code uses an uninitialized value l to index the array if l happens to be greater than or less than it'll point off into memory that it shouldn't be touching it also sets t arr l but then t p where p is the address of arr l so it does the same thing twice in slightly different ways  Software engineering Flat file database Central processing unit CPU cache Economics The Internet Movie Database Windows XP Screenplay Escape from New York Database Joel and Ethan Coen W.

is someone trying to hack my yahoo account i operate the explorer and i have an mail icon for yahoo on my tool bar the program below appeared on when i clicked on the email icon and then went to my sign in page can someone tell me what this program means it only happened when from internet wireless connection at home php ini set 'display errors' data yahoo reg login setup if data false exit else if isset data 'display form' error log yahoo reg login setup didn't set the display form field header location http login yahoo com exit tstname data ' testname' src data ' src' partner data ' partner' intl data ' intl' this is a hack put in place so that persistancy files are picked from the regular html directory yinst packaging didn't allow for the multiple links to be created with one single command if tstname tst pst tstname adding support for pkg using php if data 'pkg' null data 'pkg' data ' abs path' home y share htdocs idaho php intl shrkwp res include home y share pear yahoo reg logic shrkwp inc adding support for partner via php if both src and partner are present and src ym then src takes precedence else partner takes precedence aanchal bug please note that if in future a more complicated pprecednce has to be added the prioritymap array from proptemplate inc ros and header inc ros should be used disabling the src ym precedence over the partner user as ym is not converted in intls like ca and cf and users end up seeing the older login verify page for ym it is better if we show them the partner branding bug else if src null src src ym data ' abs path' home y share htdocs idaho php tstname intl src res include home y share htdocs idaho php tstname intl src login data 'display form' else if partner null partner data ' abs path' home y share htdocs idaho php tstname intl partner res include home y share htdocs idaho php tstname intl partner login data 'display form' else if src null src data ' abs path' home y share htdocs idaho php tstname intl src res include home y share htdocs idaho php tstname intl src login data 'display form' else data ' abs path' home y share htdocs idaho php tstname intl res include home y share htdocs idaho php tstname intl login data 'display form' this check is put in place to avoid showing a blank login page when some test is set in common login conf and that test package is not installed on the machine ideally this should not happen aanchal feb bug if res ' ' if is dir data ' abs path' reset abs path only if it didn't exist before a temp fix for ym logout issue bug data ' abs path' home y share htdocs idaho php intl include home y share htdocs idaho php intl login data 'display form' this seems to be a common error that people all over the internet have reported on most of the places i have seen it have come to the conclusion that it is ok and that it is probably a problem with the browser since other browsers seem to run it fine and of course if you can see this code it may also mean that the server is not properly rendering php code which is quite a surprise coming from yahoo if you can i would try it using a different browser and see if you continue to have trouble otherwise i haven't seen any proof that is harmful when in doubt though you can try accessing your yahoo mail through something else other than your icon you suspect is bad good luck to you  HyperText Transfer Protocol Web browser PNG Uniform Resource Identifier JPEG HTML element World Wide Web Apache HTTP Server Wget Web server Web service Uniform Resource Locator HTML XHTML GIF 200 (number) Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Website Color theory Microsoft Paint HTTP cookie Dither Tariq Ali Ajax (programming) Representational State Transfer Mac OS X v10.4 Phishing Filename extension Transition metal Spyware Image file formats IMG (business) Virtual hosting Squid cache Rum IMG Soccer Academy PlayStation Portable Internet censorship in mainland China Raster graphics Apache Software Foundation Upholstery Anti-aliasing Nintendo 64 Dragon Booster Commodore 64 International Marxist Group Tequila Impressionism Mario Bros. 500 (number) Synaesthesia CPAN Worms (computer game) Comparison of layout engines (graphics) Electronic commerce Brewing Drawing Wood Slashdot subculture Saxophone Port numbers Capitalist mode of production Film colorization Milan ImageMagick ATI Technologies Chaos Emerald Opera house Pantyhose ASCII art Pysanka Clyfford Still Game Boy Advance QEMU Deportivo Saprissa Denial-of-service attack Purple Web page Digital art Inkjet printer 400 (number) Computer role-playing game Extraterrestrial hypothesis Nintendo GameCube Cross site scripting Lemmings (computer game) It's Walky!

which programming language should i learn i have experience in java c c and minor exeperience in perl but have not truly learned any of them i have no idea which one i should go to next to fully learn i'm not looking for which one is easiest but rather which one would be smartest to learn the first thing to consider is why do you want to learn programming being a programmer for your local community projects differs from being a programmer from apple both are naturally different than doing it as a hobby or for working freelance since i don't know anything about your circumstances i'll assume you're doing this for fun hoping it can build up into a business fair enough well or you want to have career in it alright let me tell you first and foremost that programming is regardless of what programming language you may choose by that i mean that the main concepts of programming remain the same in every language it's how you implement these concepts that makes a language different than another faster more effecient easier etc this is a major source of relief for beginner programmers since they can start out with a relatively easy language and later move on to more complicated ones depending on their conditions and circumstances one of the easiest programming language is out there is arguably basic basic is an acronym for beginners all purpose symbolic instruction code sounds a little complicated for a beginner doesn't it well i assume bill gates came up with the acronym first and then tried to work out a meaningful sentence around it anyway this is a very easy language to learn and it contains most of programming concepts but it's too obsolete some might say i sort of agree that's why many programmers in the making opt for visual basic it's a huge step from its predecessor and it works with graphics more than with actual code the huge downside is that it works solely on windows nothing else people might say it's microsoft's way of monopolizing the market and they might be quite right but i digress another fairly easy language is perl perl used to be the absolute no language for the web and it has been the no scripting language which a fancy way to say programming in certain occasions and environments for unix which is one of the greatest operating systems of all time imho smile gif it works across many if not all platforms it's versatile and can be easy to learn of worked at regularly it's totally free and it's supported with loads and loads of tutorials sample code websites etc it's still pretty much in use today but even if it wasn't it'd still be a great introduction into programming i trust some will disagree but that's my opinion anyhow since i believe many will add their own opinion about the right introductory language i think you'll have lots of choices knight but ultimately if you want to be a programmer worth the name you have to learn c sooner or later personally i think the word programmer doesn't have c in it as you go along you'll come across numerous information about other programming languages their advantages and disadvantages their uses etc and so you'll be better qualified to make an educated choice about your programming goals i personally prefer c c java but after all its your choice main thing one must be perfect in their logic trust me when i say programming is a fun ride if you're up to it just don't give up too early ok have a nice time and fun learning  Microsoft Excel C programming language Brainfuck Common Lisp Computer BASIC programming language Quicksort Randomness Buffer overflow

vb need to make new controls at run time that have events i am making a quotefalls word game and need to make up to text boxes at runtime i need one event handler for all of them and i need to be able to easily iterate through all of them i was thinking in terms of an array of text boxes but maybe that won't work i read in a quote from a text file and then i need to create the grid that the letters will eventually go in for each letter in the quote if you look here http msdn microsoft com en us library kxt a vs aspx you will see everything i am talking about toward the bottom of the page except how to deal with a ton of replicated controls when defining the textbox assign its index to to do this right click on the text box in the design mode for the form to show the textbox property window where you change it's size name etc the index property defaults to nothing change it to this will create the control array the event handler will get passed the index of the control that caused the event to fire you simply have to create the th element in the array as a prototype then you can load the other instances of the textbox at run time and assign their top and left properties to place them im the appropriate place setting the default properties for the th element will set the default for the rest of the controls loaded for example dim top as integer dim left as integer dim width as integer dim height as integer height txtletter height width txtletter width top txtletter top for i to if i mod then top top height left txtletter left width end if load txtletter i left left width txtletter i top top txtletter i left left next i  Microsoft FrontPage Website Web page Nvu Web browser Web template HTML MSNBC Web hosting Microsoft Office Good Morning America Browser wars Macromedia Dreamweaver Microsoft CNBC Windows NT 4.0 Search engine optimization FrontPageMag.com Weekend Update (sketch) USS Santee (CVE-29) KIRO-TV Something Awful USS Anzio (CVE-57) Linspire WCCO WTOG Server Message Block WBZ-TV Whose Line Is It Anyway?

where can i find infomation to create a pop up model css html apparantly it's a pop up but in the same window that overlaps the window with a transparency to bring the pop up to your attention i think its spelled modal can it be done without javascript and just css html any tutorials would be helpful in order for an event to be created you must use some form of scripting such as javascript or vbscript a 'pop up' must be triggered by such events but you are right the model of this kind of pop up would be through css html you would create a div layer set to an absolute position javascript could be utilized to switch the display or visibility attribute from on to off none or block it would be my recommendation to review websites referring to javascript and css programming of course if you are not allowed to use javascript then it would be a waste of time unless you are like so many others that just love to learn about languages have a wonderful day  PNG GIF Adobe Photoshop Mouse (computing) Macromedia Flash Macromedia Fireworks Microsoft .NET WordStar Screenshot 2D computer graphics Cursor (computers) Web page History of the graphical user interface Windows 2000 Mozilla Firefox NTFS IPhoto RGB color model Microsoft Office Windows XP Mozilla Application Suite Portable Document Format Quake III Arena MP3 Transparency (computing) Super Nintendo Entertainment System Windows Me Tagged Image File Format GIMP Comparison of web browsers PlayStation Portable Vi Mandriva Linux Blue screen of death JPEG 2000 Windows Vista Adobe InDesign IPod MDAC Minesweeper (computer game) Proxy server GNU Free Documentation License Lemmings 2: The Tribes ICalendar ITunes Archy Glass Icon (computing) OpenDocument BitTorrent Partition (computing) Typeface Something Awful Forums Perl Uploading and downloading Tux Paint JavaScript Digital image editing Photoshopping ImageMagick Common Unix Printing System HTML element TeX Bryce QuickTime Frog Copy protection FreeBSD Vorbis OpenBSD Monkey Island Adobe Acrobat Stardock Digital photography Comparison of media players Comment Mac OS X v10.4 Invisibility Modem Object Desktop Final Fantasy III KDE ASCII art Ebook Unicode MAME Kazaa Linux Image Direct Client-to-Client Microsoft PowerPoint ANSI art System 7 (Macintosh) Printed circuit board Warez WordPerfect Linux distribution Cascading Style Sheets Miranda IM

object decl in java why do v decl an object in java as class name obj new class name unlike class name obj in c it's sort of an artifact of java hiding pointers and doing memory management for you in c you can write class name obj or class name pobj new class name in a method as a temporary variable the first one declares a temporary variable that's an instance of the class temp variables are stored on the stack so the instance of the class itself is on the stack the other one declares a temp variable that is a pointer to an allocated instance from the heap in the latter case the only thing on the stack is the pointer to the object in the former case the instance is thrown away when the method returns because the method's temporary stack space is given up in the latter case the pointer is given up but the instance it points to must be explicitly deleted by the coder java on the other hand deals with all non primitive types by reference but hides the pointers a declaration of a temporary variable class name foo effectively creates a pointer on the stack but leaves it pointing at nothing there's not a separate syntax for declaring a pointer because pointers are hidden from the coder if java were to create an instance automatically for this syntax it would lead to a lot of waste since one doesn't always want to create the instance locally the c syntax for object instantiation on the heap new class name is pretty much identical to java's in java all objects are on the heap and are cleaned up by the java vm's garbage collection transparently to the coder when they are no longer referenced so the coder does not need to make the distinction between temporary and permanent objects this makes java easier to code in and less prone to issues like memory leaks and entirely free of segmentation faults and the like but there is a cost for letting the system do memory management for you so java is much less efficient when executing  JavaScript HTML element Cascading Style Sheets HTML HTML editor Macromedia Flash Ajax (programming) Opera (web browser) Mozilla Application Suite Cross site scripting Mozilla Firefox Dynamic HTML XML Hello world program Comparison of layout engines (HTML) Web page Wiki Unicode Visual Basic ActionScript Object-oriented programming XForms Categorical list of programming languages XSL Transformations Gmail Stopping e-mail abuse DOM Events JADE programming language Diablo II: Lord of Destruction World Wide Web OpenGL Michael Morrison Windows XP Web application HTML scripting Windows 2000 Konfabulator Markup language Ebook Oscilloscope Comparison of web browsers HTTP cookie Scripting language Lotus Notes PHP Internet Explorer DVD TikiWiki International Phonetic Alphabet Client-side scripting XMLHTTP Calculator Portable Document Format Document Type Definition Document Object Model Cocoa (API) Website Inkscape CSS Virginia MDAC Unicode and HTML Regular expression XUL Gecko (layout engine) Common Unix Printing System Application programming interface Java programming language Associative array Linked list Typeface Ruby on Rails Filename extension Windows Presentation Foundation Emacs Browser wars Forth programming language Web colors Rich Internet Application Link spam AmigaOS Mac OS X v10.4 Scalable Vector Graphics Screenshot 2D computer graphics OpenDocument Comment GIMP HyperTalk XHTML Eclipse (computing) Server-side scripting ASCII art VME

whats the starting hourly rate for a user experience designer websites without work experience depends on how good you are most good freelance designers don't charge per hour they end up charging the person a sum of money for the layout i've seen some people charge more than a layout but that's coding and complicated flash stuff that most people can do he was also professional with around a year of experience me and my friend would get around a layout but it depended on how much work we were doing if they want a huge layout with a lot of stuff charge more if it's just a simple couple of things with text and they don't want it coded don't charge as much basically it depends on how good you are and how good the client thinks your services are if you work a lot of hours toss a couple extra bucks in there but i would recommend charging per layout  HTML element Cascading Style Sheets Web design XML Opera (web browser) Typeface CPU cache EIA-708 HTML Stack (computing) Web page Page widening Bicycle frame Bracket Debugging Comparison of layout engines (CSS) Markup language Colours, standards and guidons Apollo Guidance Computer Search engine optimization Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME X86 assembly language Condom PIC microcontroller Hello world program Tag Computer and video game genres Book of Daniel Handloading Strap-on dildo HTML editor Toronto Blue Jays Chicago White Sox St. Louis Cardinals Cleveland Indians String (computer science) Sega Saturn TikiWiki Buffer overflow Ajax (programming) PostScript Mouse (computing) DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Binary GCD algorithm Logo programming language Swingout Non-native pronunciations of English Quotation mark Von Neumann architecture Floppy disk Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) ASP.NET JavaServer Pages Atari 8-bit family Windows XP Professional wrestling match types BASIC programming language Japanese tea ceremony Glossary of American football Torah Slashdot trolling phenomena Hierarchical File System Canoe Einstein-Cartan theory Billiards Violin Unix time Comment Archimedes Video game console Bong Geologic time scale Merge sort Divergence PHP Lex Luger 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sanskrit Deuteronomy Tire DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Pump It Up DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Patricia Ford Software bug Seattle Mariners Cross site scripting Messianic Judaism Tampa Bay Devil Rays Switch Fighting game Dead Sea scrolls Oxford United F.C.

why can't i call console based exe files from within batch files on win apache i've installed apache and i've got a script that is called whenever a certain file extension is encountered for example scriptalias script c foo addtype application x httpd foo foo action application x httpd foo foo run bat now this works fine if run bat just 'echo's something sensible echo off echo content type text plain echo echo echo this works the problem is that it doesn't work if i call an exe even if it is a console based exe using cmd exe for an example echo off echo content type text plain echo echo cmd c echo this doesn't work instead what happens is you see the cmd exe console briefly flicker on the screen when the page is accessed it seems to me the problem is that it is somehow creating a new child console window so that stdin stdout is being lost even though the script will wait for the child process to be terminated so i guess my question is how do i create a child process that shares i o i've got it working perfectly under apache unix but i want to be able to support both platforms jaxbot i really appreciate your suggestion but i can't seem to get it to work if i use cmd exe foo run bat then apache appears to launch cmd exe but it launches in interactive mode and therefore hangs the request i need to go into task manager and kill it if i use cmd exe c foo run bat or cmd exe c c foo run bat or cmd exe c c foo run bat then apache just responds with bad requests and the error logs say invalid uri in request get i've tried a few other variants and am still not having any luck thats because of the way the batch file works try having apache run cmd exe and have cmd exe launch the file for example scriptalias script c foo addtype application x httpd foo foo action application x httpd foo cmd exe foo run bat hope this helps  Macromedia Flash Windows Media Video GIF PlayStation Portable QuickTime ITunes Streaming media PNG ASCII art Portable Document Format Video codec Mod (computer gaming) Podcasting Commodore 64 Warez Windows Mobile Trusted computing IPod AVI Common Unix Printing System MSN Messenger Web page Apple II family StarOffice Kazaa Ebook Unicode Filename extension Microsoft Open-source software ITunes Music Store JPEG Opera (web browser) America Online Online music store Mac OS X File format Digital photography Bulletin board system Spyware Apple Computer Mach kernel Karaoke Free software Paint Shop Pro Software engineering RealNetworks MPlayer Copyright infringement of software Mac OS X v10.4 TiVo Musical Instrument Digital Interface SonicStage AOL Instant Messenger Atari 8-bit family Source code Internet Google Stardock Comparison of media players Gmail ImageMagick Theora Open source culture Vorbis Public domain Library (computer science) BitTorrent NTFS Copy protection Mandriva Linux Microsoft Office High-definition television Wallpaper group Mozilla Firefox System 7 (Macintosh) TeX OpenOffice.org Linux AmigaOS Download.com MAME Screenshot File system SAM Coup__ Copyleft Winamp Tagged Image File Format Abandonware DivX WordPerfect ZX Spectrum Digital camera Unix Ogg Xbox 360 Internet pornography MP3 PlayStation 3 Raw image format

transparency my friends and i started to play an online game where you have the ability to design your own heads and bodies using them online anyways i just got corel paint shop pro photo xi so i'm very new with the program and can figure out how to set the area around my image to be transparent i thought i had figured it out one time but i just ended up making the whole layer a background and the image during game play was invisible can anyone help one color and only one color can be read as transparent by the computer so keep that in mind when designing your graphic in other words use a background color that doesn't appear in your image bright pink or something very different then when you are done creating your image reduce the number of colors down to image decrease color depth colors then using the eye dropper tool right click over the color you want to be transparent so it's selected as the background color next go to image palette set palette transparency and select the middle radio button that reads set the transparency value to the current background color check your work by going to palette view palette transparency this way you can clean up any little spots that may have been missed save as a gif and you're done good luck joyce http www designbyjoyce com  Xanga Microsoft FrontPage Wiki Object-oriented programming Macromedia Flash JavaServer Pages HTML HTML element Blog C plus plus Zope JADE programming language Web page OpenOffice.org PHP OpenDocument Hello world program ColdFusion Internet Explorer Unicode XSL Transformations WebObjects Cascading Style Sheets Macromedia Dreamweaver Mental illness Character encodings in HTML C Sharp JPEG Game Maker Linked list Navajo language HTML editor Logo programming language Comparison of generics to templates C programming language Dynamic HTML Emacs Skies of Arcadia Unicode and HTML Web traffic Web template Mozilla Application Suite Syntax highlighting Project Gutenberg XHTML TikiWiki Ebook Tab TeX HTML scripting Polymorphism (computer science) Quotation mark Blue screen of death Use case ASP.NET Web colors Plain Old Documentation Web design Diary Digest access authentication SharpDevelop Generic programming Objective-C Ajax (programming) Serendipity (weblog software) Polymerase chain reaction Telomerase Numeric character reference UTF-8 Cohen v.

difference between web designer and coder what in the simplest terms is the difference between a web designer and coder a web designer is an artist like a fashion designer he does not know anything about computers a coder is a professional programmer everyone calls himself herself a web designer because they can make nice pages they do not need other knowledge than artistic knowledge and some front end program such as dreamweaver the coder takes the crap prepared by the designers and re write the code in a proper language and add functionality there are web designers for coder out of pages on the web only or two have been designed by coders and work properly the pitty is that we only see the beauty of a page and that is what customers pay for but the real work is made by coders  HTML element Cross site scripting Unicode HTML Opera (web browser) HTML editor XML Web design HTML scripting JavaScript Macromedia Flash MySpace Mozilla Firefox Mozilla Application Suite Comparison of layout engines (HTML) Ajax (programming) Internet Explorer XHTML Hello world program Quotation mark Portable Document Format PHP Ebook International Phonetic Alphabet Dynamic HTML Screenshot Copy protection Wiki Web page ALGOL 68 XSL Transformations GameFAQs Gecko (layout engine) Unicode and HTML Character encodings in HTML ASP.NET Scalable Vector Graphics Object-oriented programming Comparison of web browsers Blog Visual Basic Search engine optimization DVD Greasemonkey Markup language Xanga REBOL HTTP cookie H2G2 Web application World Wide Web Website Hyperlink JavaServer Pages PostScript Digital rights management Enterprise content management OpenDocument Cocoa (API) AppleScript HyperCard CPU cache Atari 8-bit family SAS System PaX WordPerfect Java programming language AmigaOS Xbox Comment Windows 2000 Unix LiveJournal Game programmer Rich Internet Application UTF-8 Keyboard layout Bracket Lotus Notes PlayStation Portable Internet Explorer for Mac Diablo II: Lord of Destruction TikiWiki Linux Forth programming language Stopping e-mail abuse E-mail spam IBM PC keyboard Emacs Amstrad CPC Google search Konqueror File format

javascript mysql hi i want to make web for example of news messages etc when you read news you can every second get a message don't you the messages are all in mysql database so i want for example make a link messages become bold once i get a message without reloading a page can someone write or copy a code showing how to do that i guess it is possible to make that with javascript but i have no idea how to take results from database with mysql if i am wrong suggest me something p s i am using html php javascrip mysql on my server thanx take a look at yahoo's ui library it takes care of most of the underlying functionality with ajaxian type stuff there's plenty of other libraries out there all with their pros and cons i like yui http developer yahoo com yui there's a thousand different ways you could do this but i'd recommend something very simple write a php script that accepts a userid and looks up in mysql to find out whether there are any new messages for that user have it simply output true or false with no html or other markup you can use the yui connection manager to create an ajax request to newmessages php userid it will fetch the results of that behind the scenes and load it into a javascript variable you can check that variable to determine whether or not to notify the user of a new message  PHP MySQL Web hosting Managed learning environment LAMP (software bundle) Stopping e-mail abuse Wikipedia GameFAQs Web application TikiWiki Apache HTTP Server BitTorrent Open Database Connectivity GNU General Public License Linux Perl Database management system Moodle WAMP E-mail PHP-Nuke Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Internet Speculative Fiction Database VBulletin SQL injection Web design Free software Ruby on Rails Uniform Resource Locator Object-SQL mapping Web server Ajax (programming) Gmail Load balancing Host file Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Arianne Comparison of relational database management systems Windows 2000 X Window System CPAN Whois Quest Software Categorical list of programming languages Mac OS X Server Localhost Flat file database Novell NetWare Serendipity (weblog software) Typo3 Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing IP address Web traffic IP Multimedia Subsystem MediaWiki Cross site scripting Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Bliki Microsoft Access Search engine optimization Independent Media Center WebObjects Everything2 Captcha Associative array MySQL AB Bash.org Website Groupee, Inc.

how to design tricky database table i need a little advice with a database schema i am designing a schema for automobiles and have tables for car make and car model which will contain a reference to car make pretty straight forward my challenge is accounting for the year of manufacture most car manufacturers make a certain model during consecutive years for example the toyota tacoma model has been manufactured since how would you recommend i account for this in the database schema where a car model can span multiple years in the interface the user will be able to drill down by make year model models will be filtered by year since they may not have existed during a certain year what is the best way to account for this in a database schema create a years table using a numeric id from the model as a field called model id then start year and end year as the date fields this can return all the models between the years entered which means you will need to enter the year twice if it is only one year the models in turn return the make  Construction Online auction business model Website Wget Auction Hacker Contract bridge Software engineering Winner's curse History of Melbourne Docklands Light Railway Common Unix Printing System Internet Game programmer Sit-up Ltd World Wide Web Electronic commerce Internet fraud The Price Is Right HyperText Transfer Protocol Independent Media Center Cincinnati Bengals BitTorrent Airline Social network Blog Great Depression Cross site scripting G-Man (Half-Life) Ford Motor Company Chartered Financial Analyst Dallas Cowboys Mutual fund Day trading Spades Freelancing on the Internet The Apprentice 2 Electrical engineering Homelessness Delta Goodrem Academia Immigration to the United States Skat Melbourne Cricket Ground Variable pricing Web crawler Cascading Style Sheets Surveillance Mach kernel Current teachings of Prem Rawat Librarian Intelligence quotient Architecture Kylie Minogue Outsourcing CPU design Melbourne Football Club Buffalo Bills King Crimson Game mechanic The Smashing Pumpkins Strategic management Jacksonville Jaguars Pittsburgh Steelers Requirements analysis USS Chicago (CA-136) Everything2 Wiki Mac OS X Wireless Application Protocol School counselor Eircom The Internet Movie Database Internet censorship in mainland China Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Los Angeles Clippers Stormfront (online site) Product Lifecycle Management Stereoscopy Social rule Perl John Edwards Copyleft Leica Certification Economy of Colombia Emergence Florida Central Voter File Orchestra 2016 Summer Olympics 1957 World Series Arbitrage Guild Wars Leeds United F.C.

what kind of mathematical series sequence is used in compiler design my instructor mentioned a recursive mathematical sequence that he said any textbook on compiler design programming would have mentioned i'm curious to know what this recursive sequence is taylor series taylor series have a long history of usefulness in numerical analysis especially for the numerical solution of the initial value problem for systems of ordinary differential equations since recurrence relations for coefficients of taylor series are well known it is possible to automate the computation of arithmetic operations and various standard functions with arguments which are themselves series if the language used for scientific computation supports user defined operators and data types then the facilities built into the language compiler itself can be used to generate machine code for the evaluation of taylor coefficients  PHP HTML Ajax (programming) Web page HTML element ASP.NET JavaServer Pages Web application Web hosting Wiki XML HTML editor Cross site scripting Cascading Style Sheets Web browser Website Web server JavaScript Markup language Enterprise content management World Wide Web Portable Document Format Client-side scripting Opera (web browser) Comparison of web browsers Netscape Communications Corporation LAMP (software bundle) Internet Explorer Microsoft .NET Document Object Model Common Gateway Interface Unicode GameFAQs Lotus Notes HTTP cookie XSL Transformations Search engine optimization Macromedia Dreamweaver Visual Basic Transclusion Stopping e-mail abuse JScript .NET Ruby on Rails Spamdexing Python programming language Mozilla Application Suite Mac OS X XHTML Browser wars Scalable Vector Graphics Web 2.0 Content management system Filename extension Netscape Navigator Streaming media Hello world program Comparison of layout engines (HTML) Gecko (layout engine) Dash Gmail Macromedia Uniform Resource Locator Internet Apostrophe (mark) Apache HTTP Server ColdFusion Object-oriented programming Blog Scripting language Linux Perl Google search Computer-supported collaboration Character encodings in HTML Internet Explorer for Mac User agent Cache Rich Internet Application Dynamic HTML File Transfer Protocol Unicode and HTML XMLHTTP Cross-platform HTML scripting Captcha Distributed computing Java programming language Web analytics Proxy server Windows Presentation Foundation MySQL Web crawler XForms WebObjects Mono development platform

which one is better sql or oracle can somebody please answer me which is better between sql and oracle databases and let me know the reason your question is confusing sql is a data manipulation and structure definition language used in many if not all relational database management systems oracle is a rdbms that uses the sql language it also incorporates an programming extension called pl sql i don't know if they changed the name of that oracle is widely acknowledged as the premier database in the world it is used in just about every fortune business at one time they did sell a pc based version which was full featured but that has long since been discontinued the oracle database has been the leader in developing performance enhancements such as record level locking which allows other users to access records within the same block it also is a true database manager in the sense that each data structure table is maintained with the files of the rdbms and not an individual file such as file management database use there are many technical reasons as well as performance reasons not enough room here to list them all if you are asking about small databases or those which can be run on a pc or very small computer then access or sql server are probably the better choices mysql is one of which i heard recently i think you can download it for free i do have to admit i'm a little biased toward oracle see the source  HyperText Transfer Protocol Uniform Resource Locator Common Unix Printing System Web server Flowchart World Wide Web Website Wget HTML Domain Name System Ajax (programming) Web page Microsoft Office Cross site scripting JavaServer Pages Uniform Resource Identifier Apache HTTP Server Finance Unicode and HTML Mozilla Firefox Representational State Transfer HTML element Filename extension Mydoom Southeastern Anatolia Project Macromedia Flash Virtual hosting SAML Spyware Electronic commerce Web browser Portable Document Format Client-server Process XHTML Transmission Control Protocol Lotus Notes Linked list Graphics Phishing Web crawler Enterprise content management Internet Ice core Thin client Cross-platform OpenOffice.org Multimedia Messaging System Slash (punctuation) SAS System Gmail History of the Internet Karytaina Markup language Squid cache Unified Modeling Language Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Inspiration (computer program) Domain name Character encodings in HTML World Wide Web Consortium Hello world program Scalable Vector Graphics Data flow diagram JADE programming language BitTorrent Web analytics Astrology Free software Workflow Macromedia Internet censorship in mainland China Digest access authentication File Transfer Protocol International Phonetic Alphabet Virtuoso Universal Server Digital art Ranger program Java Servlet HyperCard Web portal CPAN Cascading Style Sheets Software agent Application service provider Extreme Programming Jabber Mozilla Application Suite Wireless Application Protocol Unix Fire Online shop ASCII art AmigaOS Web cache Web service Requirements analysis

what is the difference between a binarywriter and a streamwriter as much information as you can provide would be very much appreciated also my ultimate goal is to be able to save an object a very simple object what kind of writer do i need to do that the key top serializing an entire class model is the binaryformatter class found in the runtimeserialization formatters binary namespace note the entire name of the namespace does not display properly in this answers editor answers editor truncates the name due to the series of dots used you must look up the full name of the namespace and make the appropriate changes basically the class's serialize method stores each member variable of the specified object in turn a a binary image of its data in memory when a member variable is in fact a non value member it stores an image of each member variable of that owned object and so on until the entire object model has been persisted for it to do this every class in the object model must be marked with the serializable attribute the result is a binary file of data that can be used to reconstruct the object model let's say that you are closing a form frmmyform that has used a instance instanceof myclass which is an instance of a class called myclass to serialize the class instance called instanceof myclass private sub frmmyform closing first mark the class as serializable with the class attribute marker serializable serializable myclass 'class members 'class properties 'class methods end class dim filename as string c data bin yourclass dat dim str as new io filestream filename io filemode create dim b as new runtime serialization formatters binary binaryformatter b serialize str instanceof myclass end sub 'sub frmmyrform closing to de serialize the object when your re load frmyourform private sub frmmyform load dim filename as string c data bin yourclass dat 'declare an instance of your class dim newinstanceof myclass as myclass if io file exists filename then dim str as new io filestream filename io filemode open dim b as new runtime serialization formaters binary binaryformatter 'cast the resulting objet to the correct type to complete the de serialization process newinstanceof myclass ctype b deserialize str instanceof myclass str close end if end sub  Uniform Resource Locator Gmail Phishing Computer Software engineering Cross site scripting World Wide Web Website Dog agility RuneScape cheats PHP Monopoly (game) Digital photography E-mail spam GameFAQs Ajax (programming) Surveillance Hamster Internet forum System/36 Lighting Domain Name System Monetary policy Atari 8-bit family CDC 6600 IPod BASIC programming language Supply and demand Option Autonomous building Pretty Good Privacy Fancy rat SAML Mac OS X Domestic rabbit Hong Kong International Airport The Apprentice 2 USB flash drive Cat Commodore 64 America Online Solar cell Sears Holdings Corporation Internet fraud Web design Sega Saturn Circuit design Password Shau Kei Wan Magic: The Gathering Oscilloscope HTML Solar power Wal-Mart Web crawler Web page Mortgage Ecco the Dolphin History of the Internet Apple Macintosh Border Collie CPU design The Standard REBOL Poker jargon Taikyoku shogi Tai shogi PLATO Ryanair XML Dairy Dog Secure Shell Textbook HyperText Transfer Protocol Hyperinflation Everything2 Gross domestic product The Best Page in the Universe Greyhound racing Stopping e-mail abuse Nintendo Jack Russell Terrier Health insurance System/34 LiveJournal Ra (board game) Federal Reserve Gold as an investment TRS-80 Apache HTTP Server Education in the United States Internet phenomenon Central processing unit

sequential file when do you use a sequential file over a database when would a database be more beneficial than a sequential file is it possible for the two types of permanent storage to be used interchangeably sequential files cannot be easily accessed in the middle backups to tape are generally stored as sequential files because tapes are rarely used to access bits and pieces of info in the middle you restore everything you saved to a tape and then do the search on the much faster disk an indexed file lends itself to be searched efficiently think of a dictionary to check up zymurgy you dont need to go through every word till you reach the desired word a file can have several indexes so that you can search by more than just the one criterion in an efficient way databases are generally a collection of indexed files generally it isn't feasible to use sequential files interchangeably with indexed ones  IBM PC compatible Game design Computer and video games Game programmer Video game music Nintendo GameCube Game designer Game engine Video game player Arcade game Counter-Strike LOL (Internet slang) Computer role-playing game Tourism Pure Pwnage Economy of Macau Space Quest Xbox The Sims Advertising Video game publisher Abandonware Handheld game console Adventure game Insurance Karaoke Game development Pac-Man Atari 2600 Video game console Amiga Serious game Internet slang Fair use Nintendo Power The Late Show with David Letterman Intellivision World Series Baseball Renault First-person shooter Colecovision Software engineering Child pornography Sega Saturn Metal Gear (video game) Commodore C64 Games System Sega Nuclear fuel cycle Commodore VIC-20 Metroid Prime 2: Echoes Super Mario 64 10cc Atari ST Commodore 64 Halo: Combat Evolved ATI Technologies Scheme programming language Neo-Geo Video game developer Commodore International Video game controversy BMW Science Neopets Globalization Economic inequality Video game crash of 1983 The Damned Unemployment Google Computer and video game genres SNK Playmore PONG Overclocking Nintendo Entertainment System Margin of error Golden Age of Arcade Games Koji Kondo Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Baseball statistics Super Mario 128 Pok__mon move Multimedia Yugo Herfindahl index Parachuting Electronic Arts C plus plus Super Nintendo Entertainment System Ultima Online Ice hockey Citro__n 2CV Cheapass Games Wargaming Ethernet Dungeons & Dragons Coin collecting The Cure Home computer Peanut Statistics

microsoft access filtering tables im not very familar using microsoft access and i was wondering if someone could give me the steps on how to do filtering for example i have a table with a range of postcodes and i need to know how many post codes come before any ideas or how many locations have a postcode between and not sure what henry is talking about whether you want to simply view filtered records or create a filtered set of records for a form you should create a query create a new query in the show table dialog box select each the table in question click add and then click close next from the table now shown in the query design drag down any fields you want to the grid the columns at the bottom including postcode if you want to sort on any field make the appropriate selection in the sort drop down in the criteria row under the postocde field you can type without the quotes or and or any other criteria you like this will limit the query results to those records that meet the criteria you specify one more thing if you just want a count of those records with a postcode that is less than create a new query and show the table click the summation button the greek sigma on the toolbar now the query grid includes a total row you can choose count group by min max where and other summary fields drag down any field that is unique to each record like the id field and select count in the total row drag down down postcode select where in the total row add the criteria to the postcode column and uncheck the checkbox in the postcode column which means don't show the postcode in the results you'll get a single row returned with just one column the data will be be the number of records with a postocde less than play around with this stuff you'll learn a lot in no time at all  Electronic commerce PayPal Internet fraud HyperText Transfer Protocol Pretty Good Privacy E-mail spam Cross site scripting Apache HTTP Server Opera (web browser) Mozilla Firefox World Wide Web BitTorrent Something Awful Forums Ajax (programming) Something Awful Emacs Spyware HTML PHP CPAN Gmail Secure Shell Kazaa Domain Name System Neopets Python programming language Whois Transport Layer Security Bond OpenBSD Uniform Resource Locator Computer virus Common Unix Printing System Mozilla Application Suite Lotus Notes Wget WebSphere Visual Basic Denial-of-service attack Spam (electronic) MapleStory Linux kernel Webcomic Sales promotion Squid cache RuneScape cheats Price discrimination HTTP cookie BlackBerry Domain name 4chan Proxy server Web hosting System/36 Skype IPod AmigaOS Facebook (website) E-mail GameFAQs Stopping e-mail abuse Public key infrastructure Session Initiation Protocol Retailer Linspire Netscape Navigator Web browser Second Life Oil-for-Food Programme Netscape Communications Corporation Federal Standard 1037C Hotmail Software testing Unix Jabber Linux SCO-Linux controversies Files-11 Web crawler Commodore 64 Shopping cart Search engine optimization Charles Ponzi Windows 2000 Punycode Customer relationship management ICalendar Cheating in Counter-Strike Sender Policy Framework Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Miranda IM Website Internet forum Forum moderator Windows XP WebObjects Electronic money Advance fee fraud Wireless Application Protocol

i would like to know with what computer language yahoo pages have been developed in fact i want to know what is the most professional computer language for developing big sites like yahoo or google actually as far as i believe microsoft technologies cannot cater for big sites due to low security and lower scalability in comparison with unix linux technologies i think asp would not be a suitable choice for implementing big sites moreover regarding php this language is not good for multi tier programming almost business and view layers are in the same files therefore the last option i know is jsp can someone please shed a light on jsp and let me know how good is it in multi tier programming if you know of better non microsoft technologies for this purpose please feel free to leave a comment here php and asp are the two major professional languages for developing websites which one you pick depends on a number of factors but the most important factor is to use the one the programming team is most comfortable with if you are wanting to know which one to learn php is based on c and perl so if you're familiar with c or perl and are comfortable with them php will seem very natural also if you prefer working on unix or linux systems then you will feel right at home with php on an apache web server however if you like object oriented programming better java vb net c then you may prefer asp net more asp net uses the net languages vb c jscript so if you already know one of those languages and are comfortable there asp may be more natural to you the major drawback of asp is that it costs money php is open source but if you have windows xp professional or the business version of vista you can at least learn it without paying for anything else jsp is also an alternative if you really like java  Mozilla Firefox Ajax (programming) HTTP cookie Website Mozilla Application Suite Gmail Uniform Resource Locator Domain Name System Web browser Spyware Internet Explorer User agent Macromedia Flash Web page HyperText Transfer Protocol Wiki Comparison of web browsers Search engine optimization World Wide Web International Phonetic Alphabet Phishing Cascading Style Sheets PHP Google Browser wars Mouse (computing) Mozilla Thunderbird Web traffic The Book of Mozilla Windows XP Portable Document Format USB flash drive Netscape HyperCard Wget Greasemonkey Web design Google search Search engine Safari (web browser) Unicode and HTML Denial-of-service attack Web crawler Spread Firefox Morse Code Netscape Browser Thumbnail gallery post Gopher protocol Konqueror Apache HTTP Server Web application Google bomb Scalable Vector Graphics SAML Slashdot trolling phenomena Computer Digital rights management Pretty Good Privacy Kazaa Avant Browser Pop-up ad Internet censorship in mainland China History of the Internet XMLHTTP Photography NPAPI Internationalized domain name Internet Explorer for Mac Social bookmarking Netscape Navigator Hyperlink Copy protection ReactOS Aggregator GameFAQs OmniWeb XForms CPAN Electronic commerce Google Desktop A9.com BitTorrent Internet Relay Chat XML Whois Click fraud Favicon Internet Typosquatting Web banner Ebook Mosaic (web browser) Legal research Spamdexing Internet Explorer shell Common Unix Printing System

oracle server odbc connect question i'm not a db expert but need to connect to an oracle xe server currently running on the same machine later it will need to connect to a remote machine note i have to break up some of these strings here so they'll display properly in yahoo answers in sql developer the connection name is abc but i think that's just specific to sqldeveloper the sid is xe the user is abc and the connection details string that gets me in is abc localhost xe i also get at it from the tomcat side with a string like this jdbc oracle thin localhost xe how do i get this into a odbc format for opening i've tried things like odbc dsn xe hst localhost prt database xe uid abc pwd abc and variations with sdsn and whatever but nothing seems to work oh and this will be running out of vb so it uses the dao opendatabase call thanks in advance thanks for the first post but let me clarify i'm actually developing this on the same machine that has the db i will have to make it run on another machine later but for now i'm just trying to connect to my own machine thought the 'localhost' would be a clue so this machine runs oracle and runs tomcat and the app running under tomcat talks to oracle just fine i didn't configure it though as i said i'm not a db expert but it currently connects to the oracle db i now need to deploy a standalone app to modify some content pulled from the db so it needs to talk to the oracle server running locally i gave the server connection details that are usually used above i don't see immediately why new drivers have to be installed when this machine already talks to the oracle server running on port hope this helps on second edit you're saying sql developer and jdbc are configured but odbc is not if so please edit your answer and let me know that could be the case now i understand thank you very much william when the hours are up you will get best answer i didn't realize i had to set up a separate odbc configuration to make this work windows xp offter odbc drivers for oracle in data sources under administrative tools in the control panel go there and make sure they are installed the configure for the oracle database schema you are trying to connect to  PHP MySQL Database SQL Database management system SQL injection Tcl PL/SQL MUMPS Relational model MDAC Microsoft Jet Database Engine WebObjects HTML element Cross site scripting Visual Basic C plus plus Uniform Resource Locator ALGOL 68 Federal Standard 1037C Cascading Style Sheets Java Database Connectivity Files-11 Compiler optimization SAS System Stopping e-mail abuse Simple Mail Transfer Protocol JavaScript Geographic information system Internet forum Software testing Slashdot subculture Object-SQL mapping The Internet Movie Database C programming language Relational algebra Blue screen of death Ruby on Rails Common Lisp Gmail Digest access authentication Buffer overflow Oracle database Join (SQL) Logo programming language Control flow Open Database Connectivity Unicode BASIC programming language GameFAQs Hash table Internet Group Management Protocol Artificial neural network On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Windows Vista Internet troll Computer virus E-mail spam Python programming language Normal distribution Bloom filter Enigma machine Whois Expert system Hello world program Brainfuck Web design Atari 8-bit family C Sharp Database normalization PostScript Pointer Rootkit Domain Name System Associative array Objective-C Embedded system Search engine optimization Scheme programming language Perl 6 C syntax PostgreSQL Spam (electronic) Anonymity Emacs Information Technology Infrastructure Library ZX Spectrum Google Talk Independent Media Center TikiWiki

dpi of an image i want to print one of my artworks but i've heard it's best to have an image at dpi my jpg version of the image is at dpi how do i convert it to dpi i also have the psd version of my artwork i already have photoshop that's why i said i have the psd version of the artwork image sizing is a fairly common feature in any image editor photoshop any version would do the trick but as you say the package is rather expensive especially if all you need it for is to set the dpi of a few images gimp is a graphic image manipulation program that can do just about everything that photoshop can do and this includes resetting the dpi of the image http www gimp org windows that is the link for the windows version if you are working on mac or linux then go to the downloads area and get the appropriate version another package is imagemagick imagemagick is a software library that focuses on converting resizing and editing images as a programmer you would be much more excited about it but for your needs the binary windows installation comes with an image editor which will allow you to re size and alter the dpi settings of the image download and install the dynamic at bits per pixel first one on the list for the windows versions http www imagemagick org script binary releases php dpi is dots per inch so when you change the dpi from or to the images size on your screen is going to change quite a bit also using dpi images is going to make the mspublisher files much larger i would not be surprised if a meg project suddenly became a or meg project note both of those image packages are free open source projects hope this will help cheers  HyperText Transfer Protocol Cross site scripting Stopping e-mail abuse SAML Phishing HTML element Gmail Uniform Resource Locator Search engine optimization HTML MIME Web page E-mail spam Common Unix Printing System Web browser Password RuneScape cheats Spamdexing Spam (electronic) World Wide Web PHP Proxy server Website Web server Character encodings in HTML Digest access authentication XML Unicode and HTML JavaServer Pages Independent Media Center Web design GameFAQs Internet fraud Computer virus Uniform Resource Identifier Simple Mail Transfer Protocol AutoComplete Wget HTTP cookie Representational State Transfer E-mail Hello world program Unicode Google bomb File format Web traffic Mozilla Application Suite Blue screen of death XHTML Neopets Ebook Transmission Control Protocol Slashdot subculture Lotus Notes Spyware REBOL Mozilla Firefox Domain Name System Whois Denial-of-service attack America Online City of Heroes Web crawler Perl Animal Crossing Malware Steganography LaTeX Google search Python programming language Captcha Open Directory Project Buffer overflow Internet Message Access Protocol AmigaOS Netscape Navigator Unicode and e-mail Wiki ICalendar Base64 Logo programming language Metaphor 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines The Best Page in the Universe Mydoom Combat Mission (computer game series)
