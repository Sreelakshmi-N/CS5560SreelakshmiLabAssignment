my epson photo stylus printer has stopped recognising compatible ink cartridges any hints on fixing this was printing just fine for months on compatibles last week it decided to reject a black cartridge then as i pressed the ink button and inserted another it decided to 'not recognise' all four catridges help with regard to the above answer i don't understand how epson can do this with an existing printer are you quite sure that all cartridges are not empty have you tried cleaning the nozzles also check there's no dust or muck on the electrical contacts at the back of the cartridge go through the printer troubleshooter in windows xp go to start help and support when the help page appears type 'troubleshoot printer' in the search box and follow through the questions as a last resort try system restore type 'system restore' in the help search box and when the calendar appears select a date when you know or hope the printer was ok the computer restarts with the settings applicable to the earlier date hope the above will help  Computer printer Common Unix Printing System Dot matrix printer Epson Seiko Corporation Blue screen of death Atari 8-bit family System/36 Nintendo DS Windows XP Domain Name System Cartridge (electronics) Game Boy System/34 Windows 2000 Embedded system Nintendo Entertainment System Fountain pen PostScript Photography AmigaOS Laser printer Read-only memory PlayStation Portable Mac OS X Killian documents TRS-80 Color Computer PHP Commodore 64 Konica Minolta Unicode Sega Saturn Visual Basic Mac OS Windows Vista System 7 (Macintosh) Gramophone record ZX Spectrum Printing press Apple Macintosh Typeface Apple Newton RS-232 Macintosh Finder Bluetooth Floppy disk Magnetic cartridge Opera (web browser) Palm OS Expert system Enigma machine Computer virus ITunes Portable Document Format Microsoft Windows BBC Master Windows API Hello world program GDI Thermal printer D-subminiature Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Apple typography Personal computer History of computer and video games USB flash drive AppleTalk Gregorian calendar IBM PC compatible Emacs Mouse (computing) Mach kernel MIPS architecture NX bit Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Windows Me DVD Novell NetWare IBM PC keyboard Adobe Acrobat Screenshot Gmail Cyprus dispute WordPerfect Newline Printing Windows Server 2003 HTML element Plan 9 (operating system) Game Boy Advance Mac OS X v10.4 Btrieve Tattoo Mozilla Firefox ALGOL 68

canon inkjet printer reviews i'm wanting to purchase a good quality color printer i'm a graphic designer so i'll use it alot also what kind of maintenance is required any pros cons to canons or can you recommend any i have customers who are very pleased with their canon's print quality canon tank model printers multiple cartridges that are just tanks printhead is not part of the cartridge but part of the machine are preferred for the inexpensive cartridges as well as the ability to manage each color independently they don't have to replace an expensive tri color cartridge they just switch out the yellow if that's the one color that's gone the problem with most tank model machines canon epson brother is that they don't have huge monthly duty cycles they are more likely to die for two reasons lack of use and the printhead plugs apparently not something you'll have to deal with or printhead burn out from over taxing the printer two suggestions consider a color laserjet hp and samsung prices have dropped to reasonable level or if you require an output closer to photo quality i recommend the business inkjet series from hp my reasoning is the same for both individual cartridges durable and readily available consumables drum unit for the laser printheads for the inkjet if you are already comparing models make sure you look at the specs found on the manufacturers' websites you'll want to pay close attention to the duty cycles  Computer printer Atari 8-bit family Konica Minolta Typewriter Laser printer Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Digital photography Photocopying Epson Seiko Corporation Atari ST Commodore 64 Centronics Apple Macintosh Sega Saturn Gramophone record Printer Control Language Hewlett-Packard Nintendo Entertainment System Loss leader TRS-80 Color Computer Firearm Nintendo 64 Video game crash of 1983 Fountain pen Inflation Super Nintendo Entertainment System Bulk vending Tax Airsoft PostScript Light-emitting diode Amstrad CPC Commodore International High-definition television Phonograph Common Unix Printing System CPU design ZX Spectrum Windows XP Energy development System/36 M60 machine gun Laserdisc Laser engraving Nintendo Ammunition Revolver Apple II family Cartridge (firearms) LaserWriter Central processing unit Gross domestic product TRS-80 Cartridge (electronics) Neo-Geo Razor and blades business model Carburetor Audiophile Diesel engine Beretta 92F/FS Tank Multifunction printer Corporate governance AK-47 CPU cache Atari 2600 Color printing M16 (rifle) Color X Window System Sega Industrial engineering Image scanner USB flash drive Embedded system IBM PC compatible 3dfx System/34 ATI Technologies Texas Instruments TI-99/4A GDI Bicycle lighting Nuclear power Economics Commodore Plus/4 IPod Keynesian economics Heinkel He 112 Aluminium

lexmark x printer why wont it work as a stand alone i thought this model was supposed to work as a stand alone as well as via a keyboard command but mine doesnt what am i doing wrong yes sorry i meant to say that it is an all in one printer copier scanner and i cant get it to work as a stand alone photocopier i assume you mean as a copier since it doesn't have a card read for other media all i can suggest is that you read the manual again it may be that it uses the pc's memory as a cache for the copies so you will need it plugged into a pc that's actually running that seems to be implied in the specs copies when plugged into a pc look at functions if it was sold as able to do stand alone copying then you can demand a replacement money back as it isn't fit for purpose under the sale of good act providing it's less than months old jbv  Photocopying Typewriter Copy protection Embedded system Computer printer Windows XP Inkjet printer System/36 Xerox Universal Serial Bus CPU cache Konica Minolta Digital photography Atari 8-bit family Multifunction printer Apple II family System/34 ZX Spectrum Laser printer Personal computer IPod Enigma machine Laptop Hewlett-Packard Xbox Computer Commodore 64 Apple Macintosh Cache CPU design Copyright infringement of software Windows 2000 Sinclair ZX81 Paper size Chester Carlson Killian documents Device driver Virtual memory Self-publishing IBM PC compatible TRS-80 Extreme Programming Floppy disk Copyleft Nintendo GameCube Common Unix Printing System Computer forensics CompactFlash IBM PC Trademark Public domain Telephone exchange Mac OS Computer hardware Intellivision Supply and demand Musical Instrument Digital Interface Publishing Spark plug Apple Newton Lexmark Law of value SCO-Linux controversies IMac Strap-on dildo Printing press TRS-80 Color Computer Photography PDP-8 IPAQ Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Redundant array of independent disks Business continuity planning PowerPC RISC Spring operating system Novell NetWare Vanity press Emacs Economics WebSphere Nintendo 64 PlayStation 3 No cloning theorem Friends Microeconomics Atomic Kitten Digital camera DVD Game Boy Celeron Modchip Burroughs B5000 Read-only memory Athlon Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Sega Dreamcast FireWire Mac OS X v10.4

printer problems can anyone help i'm having problems with my printer i bougth new ink cartridges about a week ago color black for a lexmark printer but when i print something it seems like the ink is running out and quality is very poor on both color and black i have tried everything going into the control panel into the printer icon and troubleshooting and adjusting things there but nothing seems to be working i was not having this problem prior to buying this new cartridges and i bought them because the other ones dryed out can anyone help me il reproduce below detailed note dealing withthis problem hope you will find it useful troubleshooting tips general suggestions to ensure best printing quality use the printer at least once a week before installing the cartridges read the cartridge manual sheet instructions place the cartridges upright for minutes prior to use this allows the ink to flow down to the print head and the air bubbles to rise do not over shake the ink cartridge before installing it print a nozzle check page after installing the cartridge run print head cleaning utility if needed get help from printer manufacturers hp support epson support canon support brother support problem ink level of the new compatible epson cartridge is low ink consumes fast suggested solution avoid replacing a cartridge before the printer tells you to do so otherwise the printer may show the ink level of previous cartridge should this occur turn off the printer for a few minutes and turn it on again to reinstall the cartridges when you install an epson cartridge avoid taking out the cartridge once you put it in it will take extra cleaning cycles to drive out the air bubbles that get into the cartridge while you take out the cartridge don't run the print head cleaning unless needed problem misaligned vertical lines appear in the printout suggested solution run print head alignment utility please refer to your printer manual for detail problem print out white page print quality is poor with gaps or faint areas in the printout suggested solution did you remove the protective label covering the vent hole of the cartridges the print head nozzle may need cleaning the ink cartridges may need replacing make sure the paper type or media type setting matches the paper you are using for some cartridges check the print head to see if replacement is needed there is a very slight chance that you still get missing lines on your test page after times of head cleaning simply turn off the printer and turn on the printer after at least hours run a test page and you cartridge should work problem the color of the printout doesn't look right some color is missing suggested solution run a nozzle check to identify the missing colors if the ink is not running out for the missing color chances are the print head of one or more cartridges get clogged please run the print head cleaning utility for newly installed cartridges if the problem persist after running print head cleaning twice take out the cartridge touch the ink nozzle with a soft tissue until the ink comes out then install the cartridge problem the printer does not recognize the epson cartridges suggested solution did you touch the chip on the compatible epson cartridges if the chip cartridge cannot be recognized by the printer move the cartridge around within the cartridge holder of the chance it will work is the print head out of usage problem while installing an epson cartridge the computer warns the cartridge you are installing is not original suggested solution epson sets the warning click yes and continue this will not negatively affect the printing the default setting is no please do not accidentally press enter once you select no the printer may remember the setting and won't accept the cartridges on retry problem while printing on plain paper is ok banding appear on photo paper suggested solution before you print photos we recommend that you print a sample to a plain paper you may need to run the print head cleaning utility more than once remanufactured ink cartridges problem cartridge leaks color mixing suggested solution cartridge leaks color mixes when the internal pressure of the cartridge is not balance place the cartridges on a paper towel with print head down for a few minutes to allow balance remanufactured ink cartridges problem need more help with cleaning hp cartridges manually suggested solution click here to get detailed instructions on manually cleaning hp cartridges remanufactured ink cartridges problem print out white page print quality is poor with gaps or faint areas in the printout suggested solution make sure the tape covering print head was removed air bubbles might be blocking the nozzle wrap the cartridge with paper towel and slightly shake squeeze a bit the air should be cleared out once the correct color ink flowing out printer contact may be dirty gently wipe printer contact with paper tower avoiding touching it with fingers print head might be partially clogged you may try priming the cartridge if still clogged then placing the clogged cartridge in inch of warm water for minutes when ink starts to slowly leak out take the cartridge out of the water and dry it using a soft cloth placing it into your printer and run the print head cleaning utility tips if you forgot to remove the label take out the ink cartridge turn off the printer for a few minutes then turn it on again to reinstall the ink cartridges with the label removed please follow the instruction in your printer manual to clean the print head note that running the print head cleaning utility consumes ink please do not over use it to ensure best printing quality we recommend that you use the printer at least once a week leaving the printer unused for a long time may cause clogging of the print head for compatible epson cartridges with chip the little green circuit on the side of the cartridge never touch the chip if you did try to clean the chip with dry tissue the cartridge may not be recognized if the spring touching needle in the print head the cartridge holder is out of usage or damaged or the spring tablet in the printer is out of usage you may need to have the print head repaired or replaced priming the cartridge is a process that allows the print head to open up for the ink to come through get a damp paper towel press and hold on the print head copper strip facing down for around seconds this will bring the ink to the surface of the print head and the flow of the ink will start again  Oscilloscope

why is my printer not printing i have my hp c printer connected to my new hp desktop and when i try to print a document it never prints when i click the taskbar button that lists the jobs for the printer they all say error printing under 'status' the same thing happens when i connect the printer to my laptop i have the printer connected the exact same way as i did to my old pc when it worked just fine what could be wrong it could be that the old thing just wore out buy a new one this time get a canon new hp printer stink canon has better color better quality lower cost cartridges you really will love your new canon i know professional photographers that swear by them you see that old hp gave you a tri color cartridge so when yellow runs out you spend for a whole new cartridge but look at the canon it has a separate cartridge for each color so when yellow runs out you don't waste ink you would be surprise about how long some of the other colors last this saves a ton of money look for it at staples or other good retail store that offers a no hassle return policy check wal mart good luck and happy computing  Computer printer Inkjet printer Windows XP Digital photography Mac OS X Laser printer Common Unix Printing System Dot matrix printer PostScript System/34 System/36 Game Boy Color Staples, Inc.

inkjet or laser for detail and color i need to replicate art pictures with the uttermost detail with still a lot of concern to correct color should i choose inkjet or laser when choosing one what should i look for dpi resolution type of ink or toner what's best for micro printing anything that can print micro text or numbers should be fine capturing the details of the art colors should match up well too of course practically all color laser and monochrome laser printers print razor sharp text color lasers can print color charts and two dimensional graphics pretty well but they don't match what an ink jet printer can do with a photograph ink jet photos are downright beautiful but most of them will produce somewhat fuzzy and jagged font test it just cannot reproduce the fine line detail of line art or graphics the best way to determine print quality and speed is not by looking at the resolution specifics instead just print out a sample and see for yourself this is because most any inkjet on the market can print a beautiful x photo that is how good the modern printers have become fairly modest resolutions for laser printers suffice for printing sharp text and simple graphics  Dot matrix printer Dots per inch Konica Minolta Inkjet printer Pixel Digital photography PostScript Typewriter Gamut Color printing Typeface Raster graphics Laser printer Photocopying Stereoscopy Drawing Printer Control Language WYSIWYG Plotter LaserWriter 2D computer graphics Printmaking Mouse (computing) Screen-printing Photographic film Computer Amstrad CPC Apple typography Printing ASCII art Atari 8-bit family Epson Seiko Corporation Killian documents Color Magnetic ink character recognition Atari ST Portable Document Format High-definition television Halftone Typesetting Common Unix Printing System PNG Laser engraving QuickDraw Graphics Monochromator Xerox Printed circuit board Color Graphics Adapter Xerography Panoramic photography AMD Nintendo 64 Offset printing TRS-80 Nintendo BBC Micro Image scanner TrueType Light-emitting diode Digital camera Traditional animation CMYK color model Ink Road-rule enforcement camera Anti-aliasing Agfa-Gevaert Laserdisc Acorn Electron Rendering (computer graphics) Color space Mac OS X Apple II family System/36 Xerox Star Laser Hewlett-Packard Toner Apple Macintosh Unicode Cartridge (electronics) BASIC programming language Video Graphics Array United States dollar Ebook Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis IPod Aliasing MEMS Printing press System/34 Tattoo Automatic number plate recognition Compact disc

who had played driver parallel lines the game is very nice i've played the pc and the xbox version of the game and i'd have to say it's an awesome game that awsome that i own a fansite devoted to the driver series which can be seen by using the following link http www drivermadness net the xbox version is great and is very stable where as the pc version looks times better on full quality and resolution with just a minor draw distance issue which really isn't too noticable i'm not sure about this question because it's not really a question so i can't really answer this one well i guess it is who had played driver parallel lines and yes of course i have but i thought a poll site works better for asking a question like this or maybe coming onto the driver madness forums and asking everyone most likely of the community will own it and loads of people do the pc version seem to be really getting out there and seems to be really popular dispite a reviewer that i recently read a review over from pc powerplay mag and they gave it something like a where the average user rating is a pc powerplay obviously never played the game and looked at some screens and never got to see how awsome the game really was how unfortunate well i hope i answered your question regards driver madness http www drivermadness net  ATI Technologies Xbox IGN Xbox 360 Linux kernel Tic-Tac-Dough Domain Name System Match Game Grand Theft Auto III Game show Steam (content delivery) CPU cache HyperText Transfer Protocol DVD World Wide Web Machinima Pump It Up Modchip Halo 2 Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Homestar Runner Radeon IBM PC compatible Dance Dance Revolution Extreme Programming Universal Serial Bus Microsoft GED Console game Sega Saturn Windows XP Wget Ajax (programming) Windows 2000 RollerCoaster Tycoon Whose Line Is It Anyway?

what is a good type of laser printer how much does one cost what brand the hp mentioned above is not laser but a darn good inkjet printer my deciding factor when choosing a machine is the consumables in monochrome laser i stay away from machines that have a separate drum unit and toner cartridge including some models of brother and xerox i prefer hp and samsung where the toner and drum are in one handy little cartridge you can get an hp laserjet for us not the fastest printer in the world at ppm but it does me just fine in color laser some manufacturers like oki and konica minolta have a long list of items that need replacing toner cartridges imaging drum transfer belt fuser waste toner hopper color laser will have a separate drum unit but with hp and samsung toner and drum is all you need you will decide what you want to spend on a printer but you have no control over the cost of the consumables and that's what you'll be paying for over and over  Laser printer Computer printer Konica Minolta Photocopying Xerography Toner Xerox Dot matrix printer Digital photography Cartridge (electronics) Typewriter Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Magnetic ink character recognition Dots per inch Multifunction printer Fax Atari 8-bit family Nintendo Epson Seiko Corporation Laser engraving Blu-ray Disc Centronics Nintendo Entertainment System PostScript Hewlett-Packard Apple II family Commodore International Firearm Nintendo 64 Apple Macintosh Videocassette recorder Color printing Phonograph Thermal printer Rapid prototyping Fountain pen Printed circuit board Sega Saturn CD-ROM Common Unix Printing System Bulk vending Xerox Alto Commodore 64 Gramophone record History of computer and video games Mouse (computing) Game Boy Ford Motor Company LaserWriter Leica Atari 2600 System/36 Samsung Cartridge (firearms) Welding Lexmark Renault Krag-J__rgensen Video game crash of 1983 Image scanner Machine gun Acorn Computers Atari ST Universal Serial Bus Compiler optimization Photographic paper Winchester Model 70 GDI Razor and blades business model Sega Dreamcast Lightsaber Assault rifle Exidy Sorcerer TRS-80 Color Computer T-shirt Brand Internal ballistics Plastic Laserdisc MS-06 Zaku II Gross domestic product Super Nintendo Entertainment System Hard disk MSX Inflation Handheld game console Xerox Star Clothing Industrial engineering CPU cache IPod Password (video games) Bluetooth Embedded system Stereoscopy Sony Desktop computer
