begrudging gio do you think that barca's stars might start to begrudge gio for his on field exploits i raised this point because i am seeing something in the way how the team celebrates his goal support was also given to this view by chivas life in a previous answer could it be that we are imaging things as over zealous fans or is there really some truth to what we think we saw i guess it's human nature to feel a little envy of another person who in our own head feel that they are stealing our thunder o no they might hate on gio a little but i doubt that they will publicly admit to that i mean if i were any of the four stars and here comes this new younger talented player who is doing well from the get go and might or already has out shined me than yeah i would probably be a little worried but like you said are we imagining the others reaction we see when gio scores sometimes actions speak louder than words  New York Giants Jon Secada Newcastle United F.C.

mexico and the world cup how good are mexico's chances of winning the world cup and be realistic i mean i'm a big fan and i would do anything to see them win before i die hopefully they win soon though it just seems to me every time they play good they choke i mean the loss to argentina last world cup they played their asses off but still lost that is rather acceptable they couldn't have played any better it just wasn't our year to win but in korea when they got usa i was like finally we're going to advance and they played horrible i mean they start off every world cup playing like gods then just choke later i mean what's the saying translated version so all english speakers can understand once again we played like never before once again we lost like always i mean its true they play amazing but just can't manage to win it all they beat brazil in the final in the confederations cup in and i thought would be the year but i was wrong i just hope they'll win with the young kids the new kids coming up the u champions give me slight hope but that's about it i just hope they can bring a world cup home when they grow up at taurus i'm not stating mexico is going to win the world cup if only you would read and quit being so ignorant i myself said to all those that were going to answer to please be realistic so i'm guessing you're the poor kid seeing as you can't read any more answers would be appreciated by those who can read of course realistically the chances of mexico winning it in are ok because brasil argentina italy france etc will be competitive if mexico wanted a better chance then it is mainly up to hugo because he will be the one deciding who will play and how they will play unless the federation replaces hugo lavolpe did a good job in ' with a team that was not the best but still did very well much better performance than in ' the problem with hugo's team is that the defense seems to be shaky and too many scoring chances are given to the opponents if hugo is the coach in mexico will have difficulties again because hugo seems unwilling to make the necessary changes like dunga is doing in brasil if there is a new coach who is not afraid to use younger and better players and to change the style of play then their chances are very good  Norway national football team Brazil national football team Germany national football team Football World Cup Gustavo Kuerten Italy national football team Gordon Banks Alex Ferguson Football World Cup 2002 Peter Shilton Football World Cup 1986 R.S.C.

have you heard the mexico vs usa game has been canceled i read in the newspaper today that the game for sept was cancelled because there was conflict between univision and telemundo both wanting to air the game is this true i think that you will always have dissent when it comes on to television rights for games of this magnitude there is always a lot of stake holders with a huge chunk of cash involved and at stake but in the end i think that good business sense will prevail and the match will go on and mexico will win so i say to you fear not mi amigo go mexico  Univision Press Your Luck Tic-Tac-Dough 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup Summer Olympic Games Betting (poker) Wheel of Fortune Hollywood Squares Wal-Mart Rupert Murdoch Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!) 1731 English cricket season Norway national football team Telenovela $ale of the Century Gambling August 2005 in sports Game show WCIU-TV Family Feud Computer and video games Poker jargon Stanley Cup Big Brother (TV series) Legacy of Kain Super League (Australia) Double Dare NFL on television Big Brother (USA TV series) Television syndication Sports timeline Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Concentration (game show) Consensus decision-making Corporate governance Twenty One (game show) Monopoly (game) Jim Thorpe McAllen, Texas Louisiana Purchase Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.
