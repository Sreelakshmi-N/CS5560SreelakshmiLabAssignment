is it possible i have a digital video recorder dvr with a usb port on it the port is referenced in the instuction manual as being there for future use and what i'm wondering is if there is a way that i can connect a usb cable from the dvr to my pc and transfer the video files from hard drive to hard drive can anyone recommend a good freeware shareware program for attemptin this i've already tried connecting the pc and the dvr but my pc can't recognize the hard drive in the dvr because i do not have a device driver for it the usb ports are for future use unless you have a directv tivo then it can be modified very easily to enable the usb ports the usb ports are not for connecting a usb cable which will attach directly to your pc's usb ports the usb ports are for connectiing a usb ethernet adapter like the linksys usb m or netgear fa these will allow tivo and modified directv tivo to be connected to your homes wired wireless network via an ethernet cable now your pc will not even recognoze anything on the dvr's hard drive most likely because the dvr's software is differetn than your pc's operating system for example tivo's and directv tivo's operating system is a linux version so windows based pc will not even connect to the hard drive at all even if you had removed the drive and plugged it in directly to your pc if by chance you have a directv tivo not a directv dvr then send me an email and i can forward you ifo links how to's to get networking on your unit if by chance you have a comcast dvr made by motorola then please send me an email and i can give you a link that shows how to modify it so you can connect it to your pc via firewire ports if you do not have one of the above mentioned dvr's then your only way to transfer the shows movies would be either to a dvd recorder or to your pc after a tv tuner capture card has been installed with a tv tuner capture card you can coonect a coaxial cable ro s video cable and rca audio cables from the dvr to the pc's capture card hit play on the dvr and record on the capture cards software this will record the shows movies to your pc's hard drive so that you can edit them and burn them to dvd i hope this helps give you some ideas if you have any further questions please feel free to send me an email  Xbox Musical Instrument Digital Interface Xbox 360 Windows XP Secure Digital card FireWire Apple Macintosh Ethernet PlayStation 2 IMac Microsoft Linux PowerPC Digital photography PlayStation 3 Computer bus DVD Linux kernel Digital audio player Modchip Creative Zen Voice over IP PlayStation Portable AirPort Atari ST Commodore 64 Knoppix IBook Television Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Modem Floppy disk MicroATX Computer hardware Computer Nintendo Revolution AmigaOS Mac mini Sound card Creative Nomad Port (computing) Timeline of computing 1990-forward Serial ATA Computer forensics Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Router DirecTV Architecture of Windows 2000 Mac OS X Digital rights management Sharp Zaurus Embedded system Common Unix Printing System SCSI Camcorder X Window System Videocassette recorder Dongle Archos Wi-Fi Digital camera History of Microsoft Windows Apple Computer Flash memory IBM PC compatible Pretty Good Privacy TRS-80 Copy protection D-subminiature Sound recording Windows 2000 Device driver Btrieve Power Macintosh G3 Symbian OS Disk cloning Nintendo DS MAC address Advanced Technology Attachment LiveCD Personal computer

problems with my dvd recorder i have a pye dvd recorder but my problem isn't with the dvd player part it's with the vcr part whenever i try to turn the dvd player on the dvd recorder tries to eject a tape which isn't even in there before this happened a tape got stuck in there and the tape was all tangled in i put the cassette back in and it was able to rewind the tape part of the cassette back into the cassette so that's my problem oh i also can use the dvd part of the recorder either because it turns off right away and i tried unpluging and replugging the dvd recorder but i have the same delema and it even kept the time which doesn't normally happen well that's my problem i appreciate the time anyone takes to answer this question in my experience anything that has the combo written on it is gonna give you problems i have had plenty of the same tech probs as you and my advice is to ditch the vcr and just buy a dvd recorder with hdd capacity you can still attach a vcr to the recorder via a scart an tape all your videos to dvd and you will have less hassle i have been through several dvd recorders in my time and the one i have now is the best its a pioneer dvr h it has hrs of hdd space and will copy any recordings on your hdd to dvd in bulk in minutes i know this is not what you wanted to hear you want to fix the one you have but in the long run most electrical shops will tell you the same that when you combine machines there is always something lost hope i've helped sorry if i haven't  Videocassette recorder DVD Laserdisc Compact audio cassette Compact disc Betamax TiVo 8 mm video format Digital video recorder Camcorder SCART Copy protection Videotape PolyGram Audio tape length and thickness Sound recording Floppy disk S-VHS Escape from New York Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Gramophone record Macrovision Mixtape High-definition television Live Aid Time Out of Mind Hard disk DVD recorder Halting problem S__CAM DV Videotape format war Windows XP Blood on the Tracks ZX Spectrum The Star Wars Holiday Special Wheel of Fortune Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Multitrack recording Virtual memory IPod MiniDisc Vision of Love IBM PC compatible Doctor Who missing episodes Magnetic tape Oasis (band) Girls Aloud Television Ren and Stimpy Sony Corp. of America v.

directv tivo vs dish network we have had directv with tivo and have never had a problem we are moving and can get a package deal with dish network that will be cheaper a month and includes their dvr i don't really care about hd channels or anything i am wondering mainly about how the dish dvr or whatever they call it compares to tivo has anyone tried both if you have directv with a directv tivo not a directv dvr then you will not be happy with any other dvr whether it is from directv or dish now from my experience with yahoo answers and being a moderator on a dvr forum what i have learned is that many people that have had both directv and dish prefer directv due to its better picture quality better customer support these seem to be the two biggest issues with dish network that i have seen also the dish network dvrs do not function like a directv tivo or directv dvr first off their dual tuner models do not work like directvs you cannot flip between the tuners to see what is playing recording on the other tuner dish dvrs have to connect to two different tvs to be able to use both tuners one on each tv if you have directv you would most likely be better off using their movers package that will install a new dish at your new place and set up your equipment for free if you decide to go with dish their may be charges when they go to set up their dish and equipment also with dish you will have to lease their dvr so you do not own if with directv tivo's most all people who used them own them which allows you to upgrade it if you want take it with you if you want etc some people that jumped onto the directv tivo's about a year ago had to lease their directv tivo units if you need more info on anything i mentioned here or have any further questions please feel free to send me an email also you can get quite a bit of information from sites like http www dvrplayground com http www avsforum com which are two dvr forums for tip and tricks questions about dvrs and issues with dvr's on the www dvrplayground com forum they have a forum for other dvrs other than a tivo or directv tivo called upgrading other dvrs you may find helpful ideas to sway you one way or another  Digital video recorder High-definition television DirecTV Microsoft Satellite television Direct broadcast satellite Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Voice over IP Television Pirate decryption British Sky Broadcasting Home Box Office Videocassette recorder Dish Network Domain Name System H.264/MPEG-4 AVC BitTorrent Broadband Internet access Pretty Good Privacy Spyware XM Satellite Radio Television in the United States Linux Electronic Frontier Foundation Set-top box PowerPC Modem GameFAQs Computer ITU-T Internet fraud WCBS-TV Mozilla Firefox PHP Composite monitor Gmail PlayStation Portable Software engineering Windows XP PlayStation 2 Phishing HyperText Transfer Protocol Internet troll Strategic management DVD ATI Technologies Opera (web browser) Digital television Call centre RuneScape cheats IP Multimedia Subsystem Internet Relay Chat Wi-Fi HTTP cookie Windows Vista World Wide Web Owned and operated station Universal Mobile Telecommunications System MDAC Recipe Wireless Application Protocol Software agent The Standard Modding IBM PC compatible Transport Layer Security MP3 Laserdisc General Motors Usenet Web crawler Mozilla Application Suite Secure Shell Internet censorship in mainland China CPAN ITunes GSM services Dog agility Must-carry Oscilloscope Teletext General Packet Radio Service SCART Information Technology Infrastructure Library Media in Canada E-mail spam Xerox Central processing unit Whois ARPANET

does anyone ahve a cable splitter to split their connection for their cable modem and cable box can you tell me how many mhz or ghz it has because mine is only mhz ghz and my connection for my modem gets really bad when i use the splitter with my cable box but it does not go bad when i use my phone modem can someone tell me how many mhz or ghz the splitter should have to support a cable modem and cable box the ghz splitter should be fine but there are two things to look at here make sure the splitter specifications allow for a return path to be compatible with a cable modem everytime you split the connection you are making the signal weaker you might need an amplified splitter in order to make this work  IEEE 802.11 Digital Subscriber Line Wi-Fi Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Xbox Bluetooth Cable television Coaxial cable DOCSIS IMac RS-232 PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 Atari 8-bit family PowerPC Telephone ZigBee Ultra high frequency Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Broadband Internet access ITU-T PlayStation 2 Universal Serial Bus Digital Visual Interface Pentium D Amateur radio Ultra wideband Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line High-definition television Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Wavelength-division multiplexing Transistor SAM Coup__ Pentium M Amstrad CPC Pentium III Oscilloscope Nintendo GameCube Pentium 4 Cordless telephone Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Power line communication Ethernet Voice over IP Wireless LAN Loudspeaker ThinkPad Global System for Mobile Communications Super Nintendo Entertainment System Category 5 cable Xeon Null modem Microwave Satellite internet Private branch exchange Integrated Services Digital Network Digital cable Operational amplifier Cellular network Bandwidth Digital television Power Macintosh G3 Phreaking Secure Digital card Nintendo Revolution Commodore 64 IBook Television Hayes command set Serial port Low-noise block converter ATI Technologies Itanium 2 Nordic Mobile Telephone Radio AppleTalk Jack plug PlayStation Portable HomePNA DVD Athlon Acorn Computers AirPort IP Multimedia Subsystem Sega Dreamcast Oboe (navigation) Laptop Cable modem TiVo Acorn Electron Optical fiber EMac PowerBook GSM services Low-pass filter Celeron Internet service provider

copying from my comcast dvr to pc we have a comcast pace dvr is there a way to hook it up to my pc and transfer the saved programs i have adobe premiere elements for capturing and burning digital video i don't see a firewire port on the back of the dvr only s video and usb if it is totally impossible to directly transfer the digital content then i guess i will have to copy to vhs and then transfer that to the computer but then we will loose quality unfortunately the usb ports are not activated on your comcast dvr if or when they are enabled they will be for connecting a usb ethernet adapter to it so that you can connect your dvr directly to your homes wired wireless network this way you can transfer all the shows movies as files so it transfers very quickly now since you have capturing software on your pc do you have a capture card or does it only use firewire for transfering lets say from your digital video camera if you do not have a capture card then what you want for your desktop pc is a tv tuner capture card this will allow you to connect the s video cable and rca audio cables from the dvr to your pc or you can attach a coaxial cable from one of the dvr's outputs directly to the pc's capture card once they are connected you can hit play on the dvr and record on either the software that came with the tv tuner card or the software you already have usually the tv tuner capture cards save the recordings as either a mpeg or avi format i hope this helps please feel free to send me an email if you have nay further questions  IPod TiVo High-definition television Universal Serial Bus Secure Digital card FireWire Digital camera Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Television Xbox DVD Camcorder Digital photography Windows XP Ethernet ITunes Computer Sound recording PlayStation Portable Digital audio player PlayStation 3 Computer bus IMac Streaming media PlayStation 2 Apple Macintosh Warez Floppy disk Xbox 360 USB flash drive Cable television Apple Computer Creative Zen Hard disk Port (computing) Screenshot Mac OS X Digital video Sound card Commodore 64 IBook SCART Computer hardware Mac mini SCSI DV ATI Technologies Multifunction printer MicroATX Dongle Windows Vista Laserdisc Internet Modem Home cinema GSM services Wi-Fi Videocassette recorder Nintendo GameCube D-subminiature Nintendo DS Betacam TV tuner card CompactFlash Archos Enterprise content management Peer-to-peer Voice over IP Computer network VHS Trusted computing Power Mac G4 Cube Macromedia Flash Pretty Good Privacy Serial ATA Pirate decryption Non-linear editing system MAC address Timeline of computing 1990-forward Copy protection X Window System Apple II family Game Boy Game Boy Advance Set-top box AmigaOS S-VHS

when i watch a dvd the sound through my tv decreases what gives if your tv works fine otherwise but has bad audio only when playing dvd's its probably a cabling problem or your dvd player maybe bad i would suggest trying a new set of audio cables from the dvd to the tv if the issue continues even with different cables try moving the dvd player to another tv set and playing it there if the issue stays with the dvd player its the dvd player i'd return it or call the manufacturer to see if its covered under warranty if the issue goes away when you have the dvd player hooked up to another tv that would mean theres some interference between the dvd player and that particular tv set hope this helps  Laserdisc DVD Television DualDisc Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting NTSC Karaoke SCART Audiophile Vorbis Super Audio CD IPod Xbox High-definition television COPS (TV series) High fidelity Poker jargon Musical Instrument Digital Interface DVD player MP3 Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Compact disc Federal Communications Commission Cable television Bluetooth Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Loudspeaker Survivor (TV series) Firefly (television series) Dolby Laboratories Gramophone record Crazy in Love Sound recording Anamorphic widescreen Nintendo GameCube Warranty The Residents Marching band PlayStation 2 Blu-ray Disc Phonograph MPEG-2 Modem Macrovision Videocassette recorder Digital video recorder Timpani CD recorder Live Aid Space elevator Universal Serial Bus Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back Pornography VHS Copy protection Car audio Atari 8-bit family Walkman Nintendo Revolution Pioneer Corporation DVD-Audio Equine conformation Video CD Home cinema TurboGrafx 16 Ice hockey Girls Aloud Doctor Who missing episodes Xbox 360 Eddie Kramer Digital audio player Mystery Science Theater 3000 PlayStation 3 Dolby Digital S/PDIF Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Panasonic Farscape Sega Dreamcast DVD recorder Sesame Street BBC Jhonen Vasquez CD-ROM Digital rights management IBook USB flash drive 24 (television) Alias (TV series) Comparison of media players Super Video CD Anchor Mixtape Volleyball Player piano Dubbing (filmmaking) PlayStation Portable Ayumi Hamasaki World Poker Tour

is comcast better than direct tv i may be biased since i live in southern california but the only time i have lost the signal from my directv satellite was maybe times in the last years and for about minute it would only go out when it was raining cats and dogs for normal rain i never lost the signal now when i started with directv i also have their directv tivo which are way better than the directv dvr's they have now directvs newer dvrs are the same as using any cable satellite providers dvr's now the directv tivo's were able to be modified for larger recording capacity and networking which is not available on the newer models directv uses only all digital channels on every channel comcast digital cable does not use all digital quality they still have a majority of analog channels in their programming now to comcast you will get about the same performance on the comcast dvr as you would with any cable satellite directv provider so just look for the best price in your area if you are not concerned about the all digital quality channels i hope this helps  Direct broadcast satellite Digital video recorder High-definition television DirecTV Cable television Satellite television Communications satellite Commercial broadcasting Dish Network XM Satellite Radio Microsoft KQED News Corporation Television in the United States Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Digital Satellite System Digital television Comcast Television in Canada British Sky Broadcasting Television encryption Pirate decryption Public Broadcasting Service NFL Network Broadcasting Telephone Digital audio broadcasting MP3 DVD Must-carry Laserdisc Nielsen Ratings Loudspeaker Audiophile Nintendo GameCube Digital cable NY1 BBC Radio Integrated Services Digital Network Broadband Internet access FSN (Fox Sports Net) S-VHS WGN-TV Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Modem Voice over IP Electronic program guide Television network Analog signal Digital Subscriber Line Television SCART WNBC-TV Hughes Aircraft DVB News program Gramophone record TV Chile Telegraphy TechTV Bell ExpressVu KING-TV Compact disc Televicentro Home Box Office Satellite radio IS-95 Rupert Murdoch Xbox MTV Channel 4 Hard disk Five (TV) Synthesizer GSM services Video on demand DV WNYW-TV American Broadcasting Company Disney Channel G4 (TV channel) Radio One WBPH-TV Logo (TV channel) Oscilloscope Regional television in Australia NTSC Atari 8-bit family ITV Musical Instrument Digital Interface Radio Disney QVC

pros and cons of dvr vs tivo and associated companies i m new to this subject and am looking for some wisened guidance we do not have high def or anything too fancy in our system just interrested in finding out which way to go and avoiding any common mistakes people make thanks in advance i prefer tivo's too but i prefer a dvr that i can personalize can save the movies shows i have saved on the tivo to a dvd after i transfer it to my pc i will put a short list of pro's and con's for each tivo pro's able to transfer shows movies i have saved to a pc for editing burning to dvd i am able to watch my shows over the internet from any location with a fast internet connection i can be at work and connect to my tivo over the internet to schedule a show movie that is coming on while i am still at work it get accurate tv guides since it is updated daily movies can be purchased via amazon and be automatically downloaded to your tivo once you have it connected to the internet you can purchase or create with the right software a upgraded larger hard drive to increase your recording time available from hours up to hours of recording time i can modify the way the shows movies are recorded easier with the tivo remote and user interface if the tivo breaks i can upgrade and or fix the tivo myself with replacement hard drives motherboards power supplies case fan etc the price may be expensive but tivo offers many plans and with each plan the price per month actually goes down dramatically for example the offer a year subscription where you pay each month or they offer a year subscription where you pay the years total which is a lot cheaper than if you paying month by month this is just their lesser subscription timeframes tivo con's you have to pay a monthly fee that is not part of your cable or satellite providers monthly fees and it is a seperate contract if it breaks and is not under warranty any longer you will need to have it fixed for it to work again from a tivo repair upgrade person the price can be expensive for a year contract cable satellite dvr pro's usually just another a month for the dvr service and a month for renting the dvr dvr's able to record your shows pretty easily with the user interface if it breaks the cable satellite provider usually will provide a new dvr all your programming is still lost cable satellite dvr con's you do not own the dvr and will have to turn it in when you stop your contract with the cable satellite provider you cannot easily or quickly transfer shows movies from the dvr to a pc cannot transfer via a networked connection which is very fast has to be by a real time transfer which means a hour movie would take hours to transfer you cannot just purchase a upgraded larger hard drive to put into the dvr so that you have more recording time available they usually only offer hours or hours of recording time on their dvr's which does actually fill up pretty quickly if you like keeping shows movies stored on the dvr you cannot schedule recodings over the internet for your dvr to record when you are not at home you cannot connect it to a wireless or wired home network so that you can watch view the shows movies on your pc or edit the shows movies or record the shows movies easily and quickly if it breaks you are out all the time and recordings you have on it i am sure i can keep going but i hope you can see why i like tivo's better than a standard dvr i like to make them work how i like i do not want or need just a digital tape recorder like a vhs recorder i hope this helps you in your search if you have any questions please feel free to send me an email  Microsoft IPod Windows XP PlayStation Portable DVD IMac Enterprise content management Home Box Office Floppy disk Commodore 64 Windows Vista BitTorrent America Online Videocassette recorder Xbox Digital photography Modem IBM PC compatible Windows 2000 VHS Computer Telegraphy Universal Serial Bus Mac OS X Pretty Good Privacy Xbox 360 Television Bluetooth Embedded system Telephone Apple Computer Linux PlayStation 3 Laserdisc Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting E-mail Apple Macintosh Podcasting Direct broadcast satellite Password BBC Web crawler Internet service provider Hard disk Object Desktop File system Atari ST Spyware Digital rights management Television in the United States ReplayTV Copyleft GSM services Microsoft Office Microeconomics Pirate decryption Internet fraud Wi-Fi Personal computer Solar power Atari 8-bit family Opera (web browser) Mattress System 7 (Macintosh) System/36 Visual Basic AmigaOS Btrieve Windows Server 2003 Sound Blaster Energy development Communications satellite E-mail spam MDAC Redundant array of independent disks Usenet Octopus card Personal rapid transit Online music store Modchip Surveillance Musical Instrument Digital Interface Steam (content delivery) Global Positioning System Nintendo WiMAX

i have a dish network system and i have a problem i have two tvs and in one tv i am viewing a channel for minuets and then an error sign comes up in the other tv i have another reciver but that tv works just fine the tv that has a problem comes back into view after minutes oh yeah and i have only one dish that controls both recivers and also some bees also circle and land on the dish and i think they go inside it too do you think this is the problem if not what do you think is and how do i fix it and also there are no shadows or trees surrounding it so i know thats not blocking the view the bee's sound far fetched from cutting out the satellites signal but i guess it could be possible if htere are enough of them to actually block the lnb then signal could cut in and out i would also try to disconnect the power cord out of the dvr for about seconds then reapplying the power cord it may be a software issue conflict which is causing a hardware issue of the tuner if this is not the problem then it is very possible that one of the tuners in your dvr is going bad maybe it is getting hot and once it cools it starts back to working if hte bee issue does not get fixed i owuld recommend calling your dish provider and let them know that the signal cuts in and out i hope it all works out for you  Digital video recorder High-definition television TiVo Television Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Communications satellite Modem Digital television Federal Standard 1037C Radio Direct broadcast satellite Satellite internet Oscilloscope Pirate decryption Apollo Guidance Computer Central processing unit Brain CPU cache Cray-1 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Global Positioning System Windows Vista Windows XP Teletext ZX Spectrum Digital audio broadcasting Low-noise block converter Motorola 68000 Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Broadband Internet access Dish Network MP3 Mouse (computing) Password Microsoft Redundant array of independent disks Set-top box Mercury Atlas 6 Windows 2000 RS-232 Mars Polar Lander Home Box Office Urinary incontinence Safety engineering ITV Analog-to-digital converter Antenna (radio) Air traffic control Information Technology Infrastructure Library Impedance matching Buffer overflow SETI TurboGrafx 16 DVD Electrophysiology Xbox 360 X Window System GSM services Logopolis Digital Satellite System Longitude STS-61 Loudspeaker Vacuum tube Microphone Satellite dish TV tuner card Bluetooth Telephone StarChoice Telephone exchange Booting Computer Debugging Software-defined radio SCART Voice over IP MDAC Satellite radio Super Nintendo Entertainment System PaX FireWire Software bug Code division multiple access WWOR-TV Virtual memory Electronic amplifier Kosher foods Commodore 64 PlayStation 2 Laserdisc Revision control Cache MIM-23 Hawk DMX (lighting)

i have diredt tv hd with tivo question whenever i try to change the channel from something i want to tivo it says i have to be on that channel how do i fix this onyx dracona has a really good answer and a way to get it working most likely now i am guessing that you are using the hr directv tivo which is a dual tuner model so first i would check to make sure that both of the coaxial cables coming from the directv dish are connected to both the input and input locations on the back of your directivo if you do not have both coaxial lines connected you will need to connect both if this is not the case then are two channels being recorded at the same time if so then you would either have to watch one of the shows movies being recorded or record both channels and watch something you already have saved on the directivo's now playing list now if neither of hte two issues above are the problem then you need to look at your satellite settings to make sure the directivo is set up to use both tuners i am not in front of my directivo right now so i might miss a page but hopefuly you will get the idea hit the directv button go to messages and setup now go to guided setup go through the guiided setup and make sure that the directivo is set up for two tuners if none of these help please feel free to send me an email with what is going on exactly and i can trouble shoot it better or give you info on what to do next to get it fixed  TiVo Cable television Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting High-definition television DirecTV Set-top box Satellite television Digital video recorder Coaxial cable Ethernet Direct broadcast satellite Pirate decryption GSM services Modem Oscilloscope Home cinema System/36 Television in the United States IPod MythTV E-mail CPU cache MDAC GameFAQs System/34 SCART Gmail Poker jargon Public Broadcasting Service Federal Communications Commission Loudspeaker TV Guide Pretty Good Privacy ZX Spectrum Debugging Voice over IP News Corporation TurboGrafx 16 PlayStation Portable Halting problem Composite monitor ATI Technologies Satellite radio Nintendo DS DVD Game Boy Advance Internet fraud Whose Line Is It Anyway?

what is tivo exactly ok so is it just a little box that records your shows and pauses and stuff hey thanks kc ok i get it now hey thanks norm tivo is a popular brand of digital video recorder dvr in the united states it is a consumer video device which allows users to capture television programming to internal hard disk storage for later viewing called time shifting if watched simultaneously history tivo inc was incorporated on august as teleworld inc by jim barton and mike ramsay veterans of silicon graphics and time warner's full service network digital video system originally intending to create a home network device they later developed the idea to record digitized video on a hard disk the original tivo device digitized and compressed analog video from any source antenna cable or direct broadcast satellite in late philips electronics introduced the dsr the first directv receiver with a tivo dvr integrated this new device nicknamed the directivo stored digital signals sent from directv directly onto tivo's hard disk in early tivo partnered with electronics manufacturer thomson multimedia and broadcaster british sky broadcasting to deliver the tivo service in the uk market this partnership resulted in the thomson pvr uk a stand alone receiver released in october that was based on the original reference design used in the united states by both philips and sony tivo ended uk sales in january though they continue to supply guide data to existing subscribed units working a tivo device serves a similar function to a videocassette recorder in that both allow a television viewer to record programming for viewing at a later time unlike a vcr which uses removable magnetic tape cartridges a tivo device stores television programs onto non removable hard disk storage much like all digital video recorder devices a feature that distinguishes tivo devices from similar digital video recorders is the sophisticated software written by tivo inc that automatically records programs not only those the user specifically requests but also other material the user is likely to be interested in the tivo device also implements a patented feature tivo calls trick play which allows the viewer to pause live television and rewind and replay up to a half hour of recently viewed television finally more recent tivo devices can be connected to a computer local area network which allows the tivo device to download information and even video programs and movies from the internet integral to the functionality of a tivo device is program guide information supplied to tivo inc by tribune media services containing information such as the name and description of programs to be broadcast within the next two weeks as well as regular and guest actors directors genres whether the programs are new or repeat broadcasts and whether the program is broadcast in hd this information is downloaded from tivo roughly once a day using either the integrated modem or a local area network connection to the internet using this program guide information the television viewer can select programs to record either on an individual basis or they can request a season pass which will instruct the tivo device to record a show through the entire season and beyond on a particular channel with the option of recording first run only first run repeats or all episodes to see how a tivo works go here http www tivo com whatistivo demotivo index html subscription service the information that a tivo device downloads regarding tv schedules as well as software updates and any other relevant information is available through a monthly subscription the cost originally was month which has since increased to month and now month a different subscription option formerly available was a one time fee for the lifetime of the hardware this fee increased over time from to to the final price of the lifetime subscription is attached to the tivo device and cannot be transferred to another tivo box unless the original device breaks and is replaced by the tivo company if the box is resold it includes the lifetime service for more info on tivo's check here http www tivo com http www tivocommunity com tivo vb http en wikipedia org wiki tivo http gizmodo com gadgets tivo  Mac OS X Database Object Desktop Nintendo DS XM Satellite Radio Secure Digital card British Sky Broadcasting Musical Instrument Digital Interface Blu-ray Disc Computer virus Pretty Good Privacy Central processing unit Computer bus Wget Sega Dreamcast Web crawler ITV ReplayTV Internet Apple Computer Commodore International MIPS architecture CPU cache MDAC Digital audio broadcasting America Online CPU design Gramophone record MS-DOS

i know what tivo is from there site but is it also a cable or satelite service it's neither tivo is a product and service that works with your existing antenna cable or satellite service you purchase the tivo unit from tivo com or from your local best buy circuit city etc however before you can use your tivo you must also sign up for a service contract with the tivo company this service contract includes the tv guide data and some other features and content in the past you could use your tivo hardware without a service contract but starting with the series models this is no longer the case tivo models come with one or two tv tuners capable of dealing with your antenna or analog cable signals there's also a hd tivo that can handle hdtv channels of your local networks over the air or ota channels however if you have digital cable or satellite you will need to take some additional steps to get your tivo to work with your cable or satellite tuner now what lots of people get confused about is that directv used to sell a tuner with tivo built in these directivo units are no longer available from directv and should not be confused with the so called stand alone tivo described above also all satellite and cable providers now offer their own version of a dvr integrated with their set top receiver  High-definition television Cable television DirecTV Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Digital television Set-top box Communications satellite Pirate decryption Voice over IP Media in Canada Teletext Telephone Satellite radio Videocassette recorder British Sky Broadcasting Television in the United States Broadband Internet access Telephone exchange Wi-Fi Digital audio broadcasting XM Satellite Radio Antenna (radio) IPod Freeview StarChoice Radio Must-carry Digital Satellite System Federal Communications Commission Home Box Office Public Broadcasting Service Dish Network Integrated Services Digital Network Modem Laserdisc TurboGrafx 16 ATI Technologies Kenwood Electronics SCART Broadcasting Federal Standard 1037C ITV H.264/MPEG-4 AVC NEC Corporation Bluetooth Television network MTV DVD Television in Canada Ethernet Digital Subscriber Line Television channel PowerPC Private branch exchange Optus Television Xbox Commercial broadcasting ITU-T GSM services BBC Digital cable Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis PlayStation Portable Sound Blaster Remote control DVB Global Positioning System RS-232 Digital Equipment Corporation Asynchronous Transfer Mode The Walt Disney Company Digital rights management Global System for Mobile Communications Channel 4 TV Guide Bell ExpressVu CFTO Foxtel TBS (TV network) Satellite dish Windows XP Analog-to-digital converter Grey market Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission Advanced Technology Attachment NBC Universal

i need some advice concerning guitar tuners i've decided to take up guitar and i was wondering does it matter which kind of tuner would tune your guitar well or would just any tuner work thanks i really appreciate it you'd likely get more answers if you posted this question in the performing arts category but i'll give it my best shot any tuner will give you decent results but as a beginner you should learn to tune your guitar by ear first because you won't always have a tuner available or may be tuning to another instrument that is not in tune with the tuner second because it will help you train your ear which is always a good thing  Violin Tuning Guitar Harp Fermi problem Piano Electric guitar Eddie Van Halen Experimental music Edward Elgar Floyd Rose Blind musicians I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Berimbau Banjo Tuning fork Steinberger Pet Sounds Sport compact Music of Ireland Sitar The Joker's Wild Old-time music Sonic Youth Chess strategy and tactics Pat Metheny Harmonic series (music) Timpani Need for Speed Queen (band) Folk music Chicago (band) The Star-Spangled Banner Sampling (music) Charango Ethics Analog-to-digital converter Authentic performance Cello Merle Travis Music Ukulele Donald Rumsfeld Acoustic guitar King Crimson Wangan Midnight Cliff Richard Blood on the Tracks Music of Hawaii Diving Lute Charles Ives TiVo Martial art Pedal steel guitar Music theory ATI Technologies Mason Williams Mike Watt Miles Davis Songwriter Slide guitar The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Just intonation Mandolin Goodness and value theory Bass guitar The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Green Day Ford Mustang Viola Video game music Antenna (radio) Absolute pitch Steel guitar Fairport Convention Slack tuning Engine tuning I Love Lucy Weezer The Who Good Times Initial D Big band Joy Division (band) Fiddler on the Roof Hearing impairment John Kerr Double bass Game show Jennifer Lopez Leo Kottke AFI (band) Harry Partch Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) Sly & the Family Stone Pitch (music) Overkill (band) God Emperor of Dune

what kind of formats can you burn on a dvd r can you burn mpg avi etc there are two answers to this question the simple answer is that any piece of data can be burned to dvd r what i suspect you're really asking though is how you can get video in those format to play from a dvd r as video in a dvd player for some players this is easy for example divx is supported by a decent number of players if your player supports divx all you need to do it burn the divx file and you're good to go otherwise you'll need to convert the video files to mpeg the good news is that most video files will easily convert to mpeg the bad news is that you'll need some software to do it for windows nero has some software that will do this for mac your best bet is toast  Digital rights management Video codec DVD QuickTime H.264/MPEG-4 AVC MP3 AVI Streaming media ITunes Warez Ogg XviD Theora Screenshot Windows Media Video MPlayer OS/2 Creative Zen Moving Picture Experts Group Macromedia Flash High-definition television Blu-ray Disc DIVX Digital video recorder GP2X Vorbis WavPack IPod AmigaOS Peer-to-peer DVD player Windows Vista Disk image Winamp Apple Computer VideoLAN Comparison of media players Portable Document Format ImageMagick File format Musical Instrument Digital Interface Ripping AviSynth Enterprise content management Thread (computer science) Super Video CD Sega Dreamcast Windows Mobile Vaporware Computer chess ASCII art Anonymous remailer Computer virus PlayStation 3 GIF PlayStation Portable Karaoke Mac OS X v10.4 Windows XP Iriver Windows Media Player BitTorrent Sega Saturn Telecine PNG Unicode ZIP (file format) OpenOffice.org MPEG-2 DVD-RAM DirectShow Xbox Mac OS X Common Unix Printing System Spyware MPEG-4 Floppy disk Apple II family Mach kernel Library (computer science) Nero Digital Microsoft TeX ITunes Music Store WordPerfect PlayStation 2 Format war Pretty Good Privacy Laserdisc Computer and video games Xbox Media Center ILife Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting FFmpeg NTFS Jon Lech Johansen
