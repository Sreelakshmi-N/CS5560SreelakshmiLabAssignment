why do we still follow the old fashioned school calendar that gives summers off it isn't like most people have to have their children help run the farm in the summertime year round schooling with small breaks between terms would be much better suited to our way of living today the old fashion school calendar and the year round calendar both have advantages and disadvantages i can agree with you i have went schooling based on the year round calendar and it did suit me i didnt have many burn outs i had plenty of rest and i didnt forget as much but keep in mind that it interferes with traditional family time this includes vacations relative visits and sporting events summer is the season when families can spend time together getting a chance to close their wide relationship gap year round schooling starts in the mid summer season creating frustrations for parents to plan for family activities  Gregorian calendar Calendar Eid ul-Fitr Hebrew calendar Baseball Equine conformation Poker jargon Full Metal Panic?

hooked on phonics not really working for me i have the kinder version and my yr old is excited about the program but she doesn't want to take the time to start at the beginning she doesn't even recognize the letters yet but wants to jump into the more complicated stuff i'm guessing it will just take patience on my part but does anyone have any ideas that will help me direct her to where she needs to start oh she's starting kindergarten in weeks how about playing some letter games you could play an alphabet version of memory using the upper and lower case letters as matching sets i used index cards to make the set leap frog also has a couple really cool games using letter sound cards leapfrog also has some really fun videos for beginning sounds numbers words and math writing letters in shaving cream on the kitchen table is also fun or cutting out familiar letters words from magazines or the newspaper keep in mind though that she might not be ready quite yet i have had kids start school with no knowledge of letters sounds but they pick it up quickly once kindergarten starts because they are immersed in it it sounds like you are trying your best to give her a good start just your exposing her to the idea of learning about language is super keep it up and yes patience plays a huge part good luck and have a blast with whatever you do  President (game) JumpStart Mao (game) Game programmer Wheel of Fortune Yu-Gi-Oh!

why do you think is causing american schools to fail personally i think it's because they keep lowering the standards in asia if you fail the test for university placement you don't get a job and that's it that's why they are so smart their academics are competitive here if your child fails what happens you give a pat on the back and say you did your best just keep trying we need teachers that are there to teach i can't believe how much homework as the elementary kids get today i got a better education than kids today we didn't have computers to instantly look info up we had to go to the library to actually look for the answers we had respect for adults and had discipline be it from the teacher principals or parents we learned the basics first reading writing arithmetic in our state wa we have the wasl test for rd th th grades to pass and those scores are deplorable we need to focus on learning not rote memorizing for tests kids also watch too much tv or play video games we read or played games that engaged our minds we also had chores to do which taught us discipline we usually had one parent home when we got out of school to make us do our homework our parents did not have to teach the subjects like they do now we are dumbing down our students and we need to hold the system accountable if i had children in school today i might home school them and i don't believe in homeschooling as a general rule wake up americans  Education in the United States Grade (education) Education in the People's Republic of China Homeschooling GED Education Graduate school Education in Germany Education in Hong Kong Waldorf Education Gifted Secondary education in Japan Theory of conduct Martial art Standardized testing Test (student assessment) Education in Taiwan Education in Portugal Quizbowl Asperger syndrome Education in Scotland Charter school Hunter College High School High school Education in South Korea Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Education in England Education in India Literacy A-level Education in Austria Education in Singapore Education reform Mathematics education Education in Australia Jaime Escalante SAT Catechism Academia Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Teacher National Certificate of Educational Achievement Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Lynbrook High School Education in Sweden Suzuki method Public education The Fairly OddParents Experiential education Tripartite System General Certificate of Secondary Education Master's degree Danish Folkeskole Education Creation and evolution in public education Primary education Juris Doctor Saved by the Bell Education in Malaysia Dyslexia Columbine High School massacre Education in the Republic of Ireland Homework Kindergarten University Lawyer Professor Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Tai Chi Chuan Culture of the United States Montessori method College admissions College Classical education Hogwarts Intelligent design movement School IB Diploma Programme Affirmative action Columbia University Bristol Grammar School One Tree Hill (TV series) Game programmer Glen Ridge, New Jersey Far Eastern University Artificial intelligence Sesame Street Intelligence quotient Learning Second language acquisition Logic

sat questions sat questions when do you take the sat's psats and act's if you are going to take an sat class when should you do so how should a person study for these tests the sat or scholastic aptitude test is taken a college admissions test most people take in in the spring of their junior year or fall of their senior year however people have been known to start taking the test as early as seventh grade so that they know what they will have to learn and do come actual time for them to take it i wouldn't suggest doing that because i believe that's a waste of time if you are going to take a class to prepare for it it is only obvious that you would take it right before or leading up to your desired test date if you take it too early you will probably forget some of the stuff you learned the psats are a practice for the sat they are usually given in the fall of each year and are suited to help you gear your studying and show you what you might expect on the sat later in the year it is a much shorter test and does not include the writing portion to get a scholarship from a high score on the psats you must be a high school junior the act is another college admissions test this test is out of rather than for the sat it is structured a little bit differently and includes a science section which the sat doesn't furthermore there are a lot of prep books that can help one study for such test my favorite is princeton review tutorfox is also a really good book and www number com is a good website for preparation as well  SAT PSAT/NMSQT GED Education in the United States Test (student assessment) Scholarship College admissions Law School Admissions Test Education in the People's Republic of China The Princeton Review Graduate school High school Advanced Placement Program Education in Singapore Affirmative action Education in Hong Kong Education in Taiwan Medical College Admission Test Independent school (UK) Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Community college Education in Romania Educational Testing Service Trinity College, Dublin Medical school Lynbrook High School Standardized testing Stuyvesant High School Grade (education) Race and intelligence Physician Kaplan Intelligence quotient Education in Australia Education in Germany Hunter College High School Juris Doctor Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Education Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Homeschooling Extreme Programming Law school Second language acquisition United States Academic Decathlon Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races) College Sex and intelligence National Certificate of Educational Achievement Quizbowl Theory of conduct Starfleet ranks and insignia ELO rating system Academia Numerus clausus Higher education in Japan Many-worlds interpretation Junior Certificate The College of New Jersey Education in Malaysia Master's degree The Bell Curve Secondary education in Japan Secondary education in France New Trier High School Barrister Blood on the Tracks Martial art College and university rankings Princeton University Johns Hopkins University Tai Chi Chuan Bernard Williams University of Central Florida Belmont Abbey College Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination Lawyer Avenue Q The Citadel (Military College) Stevens Institute of Technology Education in Sweden Software testing Secondary education in the United States Hopkins School Audiophile Columbia University University of Pennsylvania Secondary education Debugging University of Houston Carey Baptist Grammar School Book of Revelation

how can you get a in gcse in most of your subjects help please thanks to whoever spends some minutes seconds answering this question cheers do your homework it really helps to absorb things plan your time a lot of gcse subjects involve coursework which needs planning revision also ask a teacher if you don't understand something it makes a big difference after each lesson summarise the things you have learnt in mind maps etc which you can use to revise from do revise for mock exams they highlight areas that need more work i'd say start revising months before the exams doing hrs per week night for the first few weeks don't just use one type of revision method i found flashcards really useful where you write a question on one side then the answer on the back take them wherever you go and when you get a chance test yourself mind maps are good at condensing lots of info into the key facts and posters are also really good put them around your bedroom and read over them before you go to sleep and when you wake up and finally believe in yourself bit of a cliche i know but i was convinced i had done horrendously but in the end i got as and bs maybe i could have done even better if i had just believed in myself good luck in your exams  Test (student assessment) SAT General Certificate of Secondary Education Avenue Q Social rule Grade (education) GED Education in Romania John Cage Graduate school Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Theory of conduct American and British English differences Extreme Programming Education in Hong Kong A Course In Miracles Have I Got News For You Harrow School Teacher Pitaten Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Friends Socrates Junior Certificate The Contender (television series) Big Brother (USA TV series) Lucid dreaming Tripartite System Slow Train Coming Vegeta $ale of the Century A-level Education in Germany Big Brother UK series 6 Massachusetts Institute of Technology Coming of Age (TNG episode) Game show Psychology Milton H.

last year i was in all honors but this year th grade i didn't make it why can someone tell me the rules i also didn't fail any honors classes last year each state is in charge of education as far as honors classes and who gets in and who doesn't that's decided by each individual school the school isn't just going to draw names out of a hat to determine this how well did you do last year in those classes what were your test scores like on the past years achievement test you probably don't the answer to that one yet these could be factors in you being bumped down you may very well be capable of being in an honors class but if your report card doesn't reflect that then they are more than likely going to give your spot to someone else if you are bothered by it that badly and your parents all you would have to do is go talk to the counselors at the school depending on the size of your school it might even be an oversight on their part it could all be a big mistake and you have the wrong placement right now check it out either way at least you'll know  Education in the United States GED SAT Theory of conduct Education in Romania Extreme Programming Drug test Poker jargon Pitaten Standardized testing No Child Left Behind Act Friends Education in the People's Republic of China Prostate cancer Intelligence quotient Education in Germany Advanced Placement Program National Certificate of Educational Achievement Graduate school Jeopardy!

how do i study since school is about to start i am going to be studying and doing homework how do i study but keep on studying without finding an excuse or getting distracted yes i already have a study are it's a desk right next to my bed please just answer my question a desk right by your bed is the first temptation to distracting your study habits make sure that you are not tired when you study there i agree with some of the other answers go to the library that is the best place to study because that is what that enviornment is for aside from checking out books or using them for reference there are people that can help you answer questions if you need help too the school that i attend has small private rooms that you can study without any distractions it only has a light desk and chair sometimes people passing by you is enough to make you lose your train of thought especially a hottie take a break every minutes if you do not the information will start to run together and do not study like subjects back to back otherwise it will run together too stretch your feet use the bathroom etc if you use more than minutes then your mind will wonder to something else and you will get tempted to do something else where the mind leads the body will follow if you need some background noise get a cd player or ipod with a headset and get some music that does not have a lot of lyrics on it personally i listen to either classical chamber music or smooth jazz you may like something else but it helps me to stay awake and focused lyrics will have me focusing on the lyrics instead of the work and i'll end up distracting myself and someone else use an empty classroom or a break area with very little noise and or students and traffic if you are not expecting an important call turn off your cell phone sometimes your friends will call you and before you know it you will have burned an hour of study time let them know what your study times are and let them know that your cell will be off check your calls during your breaks but do not call back until after study time just in case there was an emergency keep the same designated study spot and time if you can this will prepare you mentally and physically for studying get a study buddy or join a study group who is just as dedicated to getting his her work done as you are not only will you get your work done but you will gain a different perspective on what you are learning and you could possibly retain the information better the bonus is you will be less likely to stand a study buddy up if you know they are counting on you to be there thus keeping you on track try to start studying right after your classes if you can the information you learned will be fresher in your mind and it will be easier to carry on the thread on to your study time if your schedule is full remember to include and set aside a block of time specifically for studying and treat it like one of your classes this was the one idea that kept me on track and helped me retain good grades once you train yourself to study it will be like second nature don't let parties and hanging out be your priority because all through out college you will have plenty of time for that the person who dumps on you for studying is usually the same one who will be struggling the most during finals do not forget to remind yourself why you are in college in the first place good luck  Social rule Columbine High School massacre Theory of conduct Milton H.

suspention from school i saw on the news that a kid had been suspended from school for a minor infraction honestly i do not remember what he did but it was trivial i think taking a child or making a child stay home from school is wrong i believe there are other alternatives such as putting them in a detention class during that time this class would be one that would make them read or study during this time and insist that they produce a paper on what they did why they did it and what they think would have prevented it suspending a kid from school is only asking for them to get into more trouble do you agree with me i agree children should not be suspended from school since there are no parents or adults home with the child these days they just look at it as a vacation not a punishment put them in school give them extra work to do have them do a report at least someone will be watching them not just letting them sleep all day  2005 trial of Michael Jackson Boston Public Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Humphrey Bogart Recurring South Park characters Theory of conduct Pledge of Allegiance Punishment John the Baptist Abortion debate One Tree Hill (TV series) Homeschooling Detention Capital punishment The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Teachers (film) The Adventures of Pete & Pete The Catcher in the Rye Malcolm in the Middle Education in the People's Republic of China E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.

starting high school this year i dont really know what to expect i have a brother whos going to be a senior this year and im not exactly sure if thats a good thing or a bad thing yet lol i guess its going to be weird for me because i know a lot of the upper classmen and that makes me feel like i have to impress them i want people to like me but i dont want to come off as annoying and phoney either my brother says all you have to do is say hi to the people you know but is that it its just going to be different and i want to start out fresh with no enemies or anything like that ahhh yes i remember those days it was different so many tall people lol well your biggest problem at first will be finding your way around haha that's how upperclassmen know who are freshmen the freshmen always wander around in packs yelling amongst each other where is this place you know things along thos lines in this case you stay with an upperclassmen that knows their way around or go to an upperclassmen that you know and just ask them in a discreet fashion this is the easiest way unless you prefer asking teachers instead your second problem will be the amount of homework it will increase know that but it isn't as bad as freshmen usually make it first seem what you do is you go into your first week of high school and expect loads of homework expect upwards of two or three hours of homework though you likely will never have this much getting into this mindset will make everything much better and easier it's all psychological expect more get less that's just natural if you think about it another issue the teachers are much less lenient in most cases they are less strict and tend to be more relaxed and such they don't have to be on your backs all the time since you are more mature than ever however they also won't be reminding you all the time to do this and that you must be able to remember yourself be more responsible there isn't much to it oh and yes i said that the teachers are less strict that is providing that you behave better than you did as a youngling simple solution when it comes to teachers be responsible and don't start trouble upperclassmen naturally look down on freshmen the freshmen however bring this on themselves i'm saying this generally this isn't the same for everybody the typical freshman will be overcome with pride and this is natural they are now in high school and no longer a little kid the effect is always the same upperclassmen become annoyed because the little freshmen are getting way ahead of themselves this generally separates the school into two parts the annoying proud freshmen and the mature annoyed upperclassmen yet another simple solution for an always present problem don't be the typical freshman you don't have to separate yourself from them just don't be like them be humble and i'm being figurative here treat the upperclassmen like gods they will be amazed and you will be one of the few freshmen that take their place among the upperclassmen and there's nothing cooler than being a freshmen that hangs with upperclassmen this my friend is how to handle high school heehee  Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Social rule The Citadel (Military College) Education in the United States Pitaten Procrastination RISC Debugging CPU cache The Adventures of Pete & Pete Scientology beliefs and practices Poker jargon EastEnders Asperger syndrome Student Japanese tea ceremony Fast bowling Graduate school Bond Infantilism Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Case Western Reserve University Calvin and Hobbes Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kender 2000 Australian Grand Prix Quizbowl Undergrads A Course In Miracles Hamster Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cannabis cultivation New Trier High School Virginia Military Institute The nature of God in Western theology Saved by the Bell Motorcycle Paragliding Requirements analysis Car handling Mach kernel The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Milton H.

should school make you make buy calculators serisouly they make you buy these grahping calaculators for school i don't think thats right some kids can't even buy lunch everyday do they think jsut ebcause you're in the 'smart' classes that you have to spend on a fancy calaculator you're not allowed to use half of the time anyways i think public education should be completely free to the consumer however this country does not adequately fund education so materials for classes that go above and beyond the basics are occasionally the responsibility of the student and their family if you need the calculator and your family can't afford it talk to your teacher and or principal they may be able to work something out with you see if you can share one with a classmate check ebay  Education in the United States Graduate school Publicly funded medicine Education in Japan Education in the People's Republic of China Public transport GED Grade (education) Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Bretton Woods system Gross domestic product No Child Left Behind Act Microeconomics Education in Portugal Education in Germany Mutual fund Stock Economics Education Capitalism Separation of church and state Education in Hong Kong Education in Romania Independent school (UK) Education in England Credit card Welcome Back, Kotter Code: Lyoko PLATO IBM PC compatible Education in India Tripartite System Economy of Russia Live 8 Anglo-Chinese School Professor Redundant array of independent disks Lawyer Education in Malaysia Standardized testing Slide rule School choice Software patent debate Stuyvesant High School Ernest Harmon Air Force Base Education in the People's Republic of Poland Education in France Attorney at Law SAT Education in Australia Religious education Annuity Alexander Technique Culture of France Community college Secondary education in Japan Public education Free trade Food Stamp Program Book Advance fee fraud Experiential education Scholarship PayPal French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools St. Ignatius College Prep Calvin and Hobbes Neopets Ford Motor Company Brown v.

school starting soon and i'm sooooooo nervous i was wondering is anyone had any advice for the first year of high school throughout middle school i was made fun of and teased about the way i looked so i decided to get a new look over the summer and now i'm afraid everyone is going to make fun of my change any advice to overcome this fear thanks every freshman is nervous about high school regardless for how middle school went so you won't be alone there my best advice is to take pride in who you are and what you're good at join clubs and sport teams they will allow you to meet people with similar interests make friends and feel like you fit in belong know that you do not need to change for anyone you are fine as you are and if they can't accept you for it then they are not worth it also don't give in to peer pressure if you felt you needed to make a change in appearance to fit in know that you don't need to start drinking or using drugs to fit in so join up and get involved be yourself and don't change for anyone but you good luck and have some fun  One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule The Emancipation of Mimi Jon Secada Kim Possible Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Badminton The Beach Boys The O.C.

i dont know what i want to do for a living im a senior this year in high school and i have no idea what i want to do after school family members keep annoying me about it but i have no idea i dont even know if i want to go to college or not is it a good idea to take a year break after high school to think about what i want to do for a living every body tells me if you take a year break its very hard to go back is this true while it is true statistically that roughly of people who take a break after high school do not return to college you need to do some serious thinking and see if you might be in this category i wasn't statistics don't lie as i always say but they can be manipulated such as by relatives w their own agenda or if crucial elements are left out like drive ambition interests and experience i myself took a three year break after my undergrad work to return to grad school in a totally different field i realize it's not quite the same but if you're determined then no study on earth will stop you i am also the parent of a kid who does not want to go to college both his parents did am faced with the numbing fear that he'll fall by the wayside as many kids without college educations can but society is different now job opportunities are different take stock of your skills and ask yourself can i improve on my skills by taking time off or not and let's not forget many who do go to or more yrs of college end up doing nothing with it my kid is in a rock band extremely talented trust me i'd tell him if he wasn't but i know the odds of his succeeding yet look at someone like johnny depp who not only followed his dream of becoming a rock star but fell into acting my kid is also very good looking charismatic and has been acting since he was how can i just deny all that what you become is up to you not anybody else except lady luck sometimes talent skill looks and so on are not enough but sometimes they are as the famous novelist james michener wrote go waste young man he counseled young unsure college grads to go experience the world i can't think of a better preparation for life youth the undiscovered country you really can come back to it if things don't work out i did and so have millions of others listen to your heart best of luck to you whatever you choose to do  One Tree Hill (TV series) Johnny Depp Mathematics Pitaten Scientology beliefs and practices Anti-intellectualism Social rule Milton H.

national catholic educational association in their annual statistical report in the average elementary school tuition for catholic schools in was the average freshman tuition for was catholic schools enroll more students than any other segment of private schools admissions public schools admit all children by law public schools must educate all children including students with special needs to enroll in a public school you simply register your child by filling out the necessary paperwork private schools are selective they are not obligated to accept every child and in many private schools admission is very competitive governance public schools must follow all federal state and local laws in educating children such laws usually include specifics about funding program development and curriculum private schools are not subject to as many state and federal regulations as public schools since private schools are funded independently they are not subject to the limitations of state education budgets and have more freedom in designing curriculum and instruction curriculum public schools offer a general program designed for all children which usually includes math english reading writing science history and physical education in addition to these key subjects many public schools offer programs in music and art in a public school the substance of what children learn is mandated by the state and learning is measured through state standardized tests note the charter school movement is picking up momentum in many states these schools are public but many offer specialized programs and smaller classes private schools have the flexibility to create a specialized program for students for example private schools may use art or science in all classes or take children on extended outdoor trips that blend lessons across the curriculum private schools can create their own curriculum and assessment systems although many also choose to use standardized tests teachers public schools all teachers in a public school are usually state certified or at a minimum working toward certification certification ensures that a teacher has gone through the training required by the state which includes student teaching and coursework private schools teachers in private schools may not be required to have certification and instead often have subject area expertise and an undergraduate or graduate degree in the subject they teach students public schools the children at most public schools usually reflect the community students may be split up based on ability or interests but in many public schools there is a diversity of student backgrounds note in many states if you are not satisfied with your assigned school you may be able to send your child to another public school in the area start here to learn more information about these options private schools the student population at a private school is determined through a selection process all students must apply and be accepted in order to attend although students may be from different neighborhoods they will probably have similar goals and interests this tends to create a fairly homogenous student body special needs public schools due to special education laws public schools must educate all children and provide the necessary programs to meet their special needs this means that most public schools have special education programs and teachers who are trained to work with students who have particular needs private schools private schools do not have to accept children with special needs and many choose not to although there are a small number of private schools specifically designed for special needs children as a result most private schools do not have special education programs or teachers trained to work with students with severe special needs private schools will try to help all the students they admit but extra resources may also come at an additional cost class size public schools many states recognize the value of small classes and have provided funding to keep class sizes small in grades k as students become older class size tends to get bigger in public schools especially in large school districts and urban schools private schools private schools are generally committed to providing small classes and individual attention to students many parents choose private schools for this reason the bottom line there are a few fundamental differences between public and private schools but here's the bottom line there are great private schools and there are great public schools the trick is finding the school that best fits your child's needs you may also want to consider public charter schools or homeschooling it's a good idea to research the schools that interest you and to get a true picture of the school visit in person  Law school Hunter College High School Affirmative action Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Tripartite

what is the point of pe in school i absolutly hated pe when i was in school and still dont know what the point of this class was it has put me off sport for the rest of my life and as for the pe teacher could they get more arrogant isn't it time this subject was made optional as it could free up useful study time for more important subects such as english and maths regular exercise is considered important while you are still growing and your body is developing and it's thought to be good to get kids into the habit of playing sports or working out regularly also there's the theory that it takes some of the rambunctiousness out of kids so they're more quiet and docile in their other classes some people also believe it makes kids less interested in sex pe teachers know all these theories but they often get an inflated picture of their own importance they teach kids to be competitive which is not good and if kids don't do well they hold them up to ridicule which is actually counterproductive  Tai Chi Chuan Homeschooling Education in the United States Education in Romania Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Hogwarts subjects Exploitation Social rule Graduate school Economics Volleyball Harrow School The Adventures of Pete & Pete Beavis and Butt-head Theory of conduct Education in Japan Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Education in Germany Ruy Lopez Danish Folkeskole Education High school subcultures Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Property (ownership right) Waldorf Education The Catcher in the Rye Teachers (film) Socrates Intelligent design movement Great Teacher Onizuka Mathematics The Bash Street Kids Aesthetic Realism Education Boston Public Summa Theologiae David Hume Martial art Confucius Aikido Inflation Game theory David Beckham Lynbrook High School Music lesson Labour economics Supply and demand The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Space Cases Teacher's Pet (Disney) Hunter College High School Criticism of libertarianism Scientific method Jaime Escalante Austrian School Grade (education) SAT Gifted Education Programme (Singapore) Reiki Adolescence Code: Lyoko Professor Separation of church and state Sport Punk ideology Secondary education in Japan Marching band Ceroc Philosophy of language Vegeta Rich Mullins Current teachings of Prem Rawat Columbia University Henri Bergson Ultimate (sport) No Child Left Behind Act Education in South Korea Singlish The Body (Short Story) College admissions Cardcaptor Sakura Education in the People's Republic of China Liam Gallagher Goodness and value theory Ultimate Muscle Rugby union The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Survivor (novel) Development of Darwin's theory Transactional analysis Stuyvesant High School Constitution of Ireland Ben Johnson (athlete) Caulfield Grammar School __mile Durkheim Yoga Extraterrestrial life Topps Parkour

schooling in america hi i am just being nosey i notice that a lot of people say my child just started school etc i am just soooo curious how your schooling works in the us in australia when your child turns they start prep and then go to year when they are turning school always starts in feb for each child and they go into the certain grades depending on there age i am just curious how your schooling works cause all throughout the year someone always says my child just started school thanks oh my god its so wierd and confusing we start school in feb and goes throguh to nov we get lots of school holidays during that time school starts at we have primary school which goes to grade aged and then high school aged to and then go to uni or whatever you choose to do with your life if we have low grades you may have to stay back a year if they are really bad or you just go on through to the next year in feb yours system sounds so complicated there are systems in place it just depends on the district neighborhood where you live or the school you choose to send your kid to usually you send your kid to the district school decided by your address but sometimes the child needs extra care special needs or an exceptionally smart child or you just don't want to send your kid to a certain school the majority of schools start beginning of september after the harvest in by gone days america used to be farmland families had lots of kids they needed to help on the farms the most work on farms is in late spring summer and early fall so the kids were needed at home in late fall through the winter and early spring children would go to school so september fall through the end of may to mid june early summer is traditionally the school year june july and august is summer break the other system is called year round school modern times see less farmland and more children packing into city schools so someone invented tracts where a group of children all different ages different class rooms of course will start one week another group will start weeks later and so on each school handles it differently but that's the general idea each track goes to school for weeks then gets off so on off through the whole year that's how you get kids starting school all the time some parents pray all their kids are on the same track less scheduling and easier to manage some parents like having only one kid home at a time it's also beneficial to children not to have months to forget the previous year's learning we call them grades kid starts first grade around years old kindergarten that is spelled correctly it's german is for year olds and can be mandatory depending on where you live kids progress yearly through eighth grade usually going to different schools at th middle school and th grades high school they come back from summer break in the next highest grade unless they have poor proformance scores that year school scores are also called grades poor grades gets you kept back a year or sent to the dreaded summer school to make up the work year around programs promote kids during one of the off sessions again it's different for every school but usually its in summer or fall still with me lol  Education in Germany Education in the People's Republic of China Kindergarten Education in Romania High school Academic term Education in Australia Daylight saving time Grade (education) Education in Taiwan Primary education Culture of the United States Graduate school Education in Sweden Ra (board game) Japanese calendar GED Education in Hong Kong Boy Scouts of America Houston Independent School District Pump It Up Norway national football team CPU cache Independent school (UK) Hebrew calendar Caulfield Grammar School USS Yorktown (CV-10) School choice Playoff Murdock-Portal Elementary School Alex Ferguson Secondary education in France Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 No Child Left Behind Act College EastEnders Education in Portugal Miami-Dade County Public Schools Education in Canada French Republican Calendar West Caldwell, New Jersey Baseball Empire Burlesque Breastfeeding Leeds United F.C.

parents of middle school and high school students in what ways do you keep involved in your childs activities at school and do teachers still want parent volunteers to come and help out i guess the first is obvious but pay attention to their homework especially younger ones and contact the teachers every now and again especially attend parent teacher conferences you should also attend extra curricular activities your child is involved in it is so sad to see a one or two kids at senior night standing alone when everyone else has parents they may say you don't have to come and watch them play but you really do they may not even talk to you at all but they know you are there there is not as much in class volunteering at this level unless you have a particularly special skill or knowledge that fits into a particular curriculum and you can be a guest speaker however there is often still a need for an occasional chaperon make sure your kid is ok with that before volunteering however there are other places to volunteer at this level if your kid is active in sports check for a sports booster club if he or she is a musician check for a music booster club if he or she is involved in other things acting forensics etc call the sponsor and ask what parental support he she could use often those other activities are overlooked  Education in the United States Homeschooling Education Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology No Child Left Behind Act Lincoln-Douglas Debate Danish Folkeskole Education Education in Australia Education in Japan Caulfield Grammar School Scholarship Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Education in Taiwan Experiential education Education in England Culture of the United States Secondary education in Japan Boy Scouts of America Secondary education in France School choice Miami-Dade County Public Schools High school Education in Portugal Physical education Prom Education reform Whose Line Is It Anyway?

what supples shouldii bring to the th grade on the first day of scholl i am going to school the th of augtest but my teachers did not give me a supple list for next year what shold i bring to the first day of school go to your local wal mart shopko target or k mart any one of those stores should have school supplies lists for various school districts in your area find the paper s with your school district and look for th grade on the paper the supplies written on the paper is what your school district wants th graders to have it will likely say something like grades on top of the list ime different school districts have a slightly different list for kids in the same grade as another nearby district would have so be sure to grab your local district's supply list i personally prefer buying from wal mart because they have the best prices from what i've seen this is what i've been doing every year since my kids started kindergarten in my school district th graders and all other middle school students can't carry backpacks from class to class backpacks have to stay in lockers instead i bought my kids a five star zip up binder to put all their supplies in as they moved from class to class it has some big pockets in it so you can keep all the looser school supplies coloring pencils pens pencils gluestick protractor ruler etc inside without worrying about anything falling out and that may happen with a regular looseleaf binder loose leaf paper may tear where the holes are over time and possibly fall out of the binder also that's another reason why i prefer the zip up binder when my kids were in middle school my oldest is in high school and he gets a regular loose leaf binder because high schools allow them to carry a backpack from class to class ace rock had a good school supply list for th graders but my local district wants even more but they're greedy like that  Education in the United States Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Murdock-Portal Elementary School Kindergarten MS-06 Zaku II Poker jargon E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.

will this hurt me i'm a sophomore and i'm concerned about things this year was my first year in a public floridian high school i passed the english part of the fcat a test you need to past in order to receive your high school diploma but failed the math section by points what kind of happened was that i was so nervous that when i opened the math section i had a nervous breakdown my hands trembled i couldn't do anything i am terrible in math i got a b in the class this year but still it wasn't enough i'm a honors student who is taking pre ap english next year and a lot of other challenging classes i really want to go to college i'm thinking of university of miami but i don't want my math to hold me down do you think this will hurt my chances of getting in um should i not worry about it first you need to calm down a bit many students suffer anxiety before taking such important tests especially if they feel they are not particularly good in the topic with a b you certainly should have the skill i believe you will have another opportunity to take this test before you go have a discussion with the school counselor maybe he she has some ideas that will help your test taking ability good luck and don't worry about um quite yet  Theory of conduct Education in the United States GED Quizbowl Grade (education) Miami-Dade County Public Schools Anxiety Advanced Placement Program Homeschooling Milton H.

teachers what books should every sixth grader nationwide must read my son is entering middle school and i would like to get a jump start on any books that he needs to read or may have book reports on any other additional tips you can offer would greatly be appreciated if certain things only pertain to what area you live in then i can tell you that i live in the new york area instead of him reading the books that he will have to read in the future i suggest taking him to the library and letting him choose whatever books he wants to read now he'll have to read the other books later anyway at this age it's important that he develops a love of reading and learning not just getting things done he will be more enriched if he reads more than what he has to have him join a youth reading club at a local library he will meet others his age who love to read too  Education in the People's Republic of China A Course In Miracles Homeschooling Jean-Luc Picard Hopkins School The Giver Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Graduate school Socrates Emanuel Swedenborg Librarian Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Dog agility Stuyvesant High School Education in Romania Education in Hong Kong Springfield Elementary School On the Road Lindy Hop J.

incoming freshman what are the ideal school supplies organization methods for incoming freshman around book covers or you could just use paper bags notebooks and or binders a personal calculator helps really always have extra pens and pencils because some teachers get anal and only want one poster boards and project materials help if you have a computer and printer good if you don't and the teacher needs a typed and printed report don't just ditch it use the school library or your local library always keep your locker organized and have what you need first at the top really corny but study buddies help i'm not saying to do someone else's homework or to have someone else do your homework for you even just on the phone or computer talking about the work helps don't spend all your money for school supplies before it starts because some teachers have specific supplies they want for their class  Computer Education in Romania GED Computer printer Monopoly (game) Community emergency response team Laptop Printing press Typewriter Personal computer Bookbinding Textbook Grade (education) Lynbrook High School Test (student assessment) Yearbook Education in the United States Education University of Massachusetts Amherst Homeschooling Atari 8-bit family Book Rain Man Massachusetts Institute of Technology Endgame Columbine High School massacre Librarian Homework Emerson College Pennsylvania State University Paper Bluetooth Fire fighting Paper size Social rule Calvin and Hobbes Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Writing C plus plus One-time pad Franklin W.

starting highschool im starting high school this month wow any tips for making friends managing time just tell me something you wish you would have known going into high school here is what people would say starting high school just calm down because a peer leader will help you no matter what they will help you on the st and nd time then the third time the peer leader will watch you whether you are confident to go which classes to go to go through high school with all of your friends if you are going to get lost get lost together also if you do get lost in the first weeks the teachers give you a break i am not in high school yet one more year but these are just some tips that i have heard also just enjoy high school because based on what i have heard its some of the best years of you life good luck you should receive your new schedule in the mail shortly before classes start usually the schools are open a few days before class so teachers and administrators can prepare for the new year you can take this time to find out where your classes are how to and how long it takes to get from one to the next walk slowly it'll be crowded when school starts etc you will have to check in with the office before you are allowed to do this you might want to call the school first to make an appointment and verify when they will be open after about two weeks you'll know the school inside and out don't freak out it high school does seem huge at first but after awhile it will seem just like middle school a good way not to get lost the first few weeks is carry a map of the school with you that has all your classrooms marked but trust me after a few weeks you wont ever need the map again if you have any friends going to the same high school hang with them until you develop new friends in your classes but don't forget there are other freshman like you so finding friends will be really easy so just stay calm it may seem overwhelming but a few weeks later it will just seem like middle school just with a little more work and a larger building good luck walking around the school with your friends is a great idea you can look around and figure out where all your classes are so that way on the first day you know where you need to be and when high school just takes a little bit of adjusting get to know your teachers too by learning what kind of person they are you will figure out how you need to behave in their class let's say your literature teacher is very outgoing when you write papers for her keep them fun and interesting however if you have a strict chemistry or science teacher make sure you're always on time and keep your work neat and precise eventually your teachers will get used to you too everyone is different so give everyone a chance and you'll do fine just relax high school seems intimidating at first but trust me its like middle school the works just a little harder but not by much trust me i'm a junior i know if you know even one or two sophomores who can make a few introductions for you that would definitely help otherwise remember that you're in the same boat with everyone else tips on how to get thru it don't try to act all cool to upperclassmen don't brag about everything don't dress showing off body parts its not cool yes all the other upperclassmen will b mean to you and they will kill you a freshmen and don't try to make the name freshman into something cool like freshmen cuz your just a freshmen ok i was a fresh men last year and your gonna get stomped on walk thought the high school with some of your friends or by yourself and make mental pictures of where things are located in the building stick with your friends my friends helped me get through my first year of high school on the first day i felt so lost and all the hallways looked the same as well as the lockers so i stuck with my friend and we've been inseparable ever since don't be scared all of the incoming freshmen are new so you're not alone life gets a little more hectic by means of competitiveness and such but you also become a little bit more independent you'll make new friends and still have your old ones so it'll all outweigh those other things after the first few days you'll be used to the school some people even prefer high school rather than middle school you'll do fine good luck  Social rule The Citadel (Military College) Columbine High School massacre Shaggy dog story Education in Germany Education in Romania Education in the United States Pitaten Lynbrook High School The Contender (television series) Milton H.

what are some study methods you used in high school ways to study for people in high school i went to high school before dayplanners came onto the market so i basically took a spiral notebook and created a dayplanner of my own to keep up with my homework extracurricular activity schedule when big tests were etc so my advice get a calendar dayplanner that you like and get your assignments organized i also kept a separate notebook for each class that way i did not mix things up like leave my math homework in my science notebook and then not have the homework when i got to class which gave me a i got a different color notebook for each class then got book covers that were the same color as the notebook seriously we did not have much time between classes or to get to afterschool things so saving a few seconds to get the right book for class or to take home was important i know these are not study methods but they do contribute to keeping things organized so you can study more effectively in your notebook take notes i always dated the notes too keep them in running order don't mix them up your teachers should emphasize important points provide examples etc get those into your notes too sometimes teachers will tell you what you'll be doing the next day so if they tell you read that chapter in the textbook the night before that way you are more familiar with the material and you can spend more time listening to the lecture and taking quality notes every couple of days review your notes to keep things fresh in your head ok i know this may sound dumb to some people but don't try to get all your homework done before you leave school use those few extra minutes to make sure you understand the material go through your notes to make sure you completed everything you wanted to write down like important vocabulary words and spend the time organizing or writing down anything the teacher may have said like you may have a pop quiz on the material on p tomorrow or you will have a test over chapter next tuesday then when you get home relax have a snack then you will be able to concentrate more on homework with fewer distractions and feeling less rushed be sure to eat breakfast everyday and get a good night's sleep everynight  GED Extreme Programming Aikido Education in the United States Theory of conduct Education in Romania SAT Quizbowl Tonality Mathematics Gross domestic product Physics Test (student assessment) Boston Public Harrow School Lynbrook High School Graduate school Economics English grammar Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Grade (education) Shaggy dog story Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Calvin and Hobbes Music STS-62 Education Homeschooling CPU cache Education in Taiwan Franz Boas Community emergency response team Current teachings of Prem Rawat Compact disc Psychoanalysis A Course In Miracles Religious Society of Friends Mattress FoxTrot Finnish language Social rule Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Roxette Education in Portugal Negima Computer Color Education in Japan Hunter College High School The Austere Academy Notebook Church of Christ, Scientist Intelligent design movement Floppy disk Objective-C Law school Chinese character Ludwig Wittgenstein Botany Web crawler Jon Secada Blog Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) YuYu Hakusho Pitaten Martial art Dyslexia Reading (activity) Timekeeping on Mars The Book of Five Rings Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma College admissions Capitalism Procrastination Game show Social psychology Cascading Style Sheets Apollo 8 Homework Behaviorism Chicago (band) The Catcher in the Rye Bristol Grammar School M.C.

school rules do not limit the students' freedom how far do u agree with this it's for my debate grand finals all opinions are welcome the nature of rules is to limit people's behaviour what you have to ask is not whether they limit students but whether those limits are justified for example if a school has a rule prohibiting hate speech this does limit students' freedom to freely insult and degrade each other but this is a good thing people's rights overlap so it's not logically possible for everyone to have total freedom in exercising my right to express myself all the time i impinge on your right to have a quiet library to work in so at the same time as limiting one person's freedom you are protecting another person's freedom put a spin on it depending on whether you're for or against if you're for say that they limit and that it's good or that it's bad if you're against say that they don't limit they protect  Hate speech First Amendment to the United States Constitution Theory of conduct Civil rights Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Separation of church and state European Convention on Human Rights Democracy Separation of church and state in the United States Freedom of the press Copyright French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Libertarianism Right Liberalism Human rights Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 4 Lincoln-Douglas Debate Debate Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms Theodicy Consensual crime Capitalism Stoicism School of Salamanca Copyleft Restoring the Lost Constitution Slander and libel Criticism of libertarianism Freedom of religion Scientology beliefs and practices Lawrence v.

does she really need that many my daughter is going into th grade so she got supply list off the internet she's anxious and it said composition note books i really don't think she needs that many what do you think she need'll need all those notebooks one per subject to begin with i actually needed more but i had extra subjects another option is to get a thick notebook with dividers a notebook with dividers is slightly cheaper to begin with depending on the brand it can actually be more costly but soon turns into a mess as some sections are filled and others aren't new books are needed sooner and in the long run this is both more expensive and a huge disorganised mess i've found having four notebooks was great to begin with and then just buying more when needed as they filled up was both cheaper and easier to work with and being organised like that means it's easier to revise and learn too if you're still worried most schools have an individualised preset list available for those who aren't sure that suits that school these usually take into consideration other things as well for example mathematics might require a normal book plus a grid book you could always try enquiring with the school  Incandescent light bulb Laptop Social rule GED Solar cell IBM PC compatible Pump It Up Scuba set Beatmania IIDX Education in the People's Republic of China Mouse (computing) SAT Mattress Energy development Redundant array of independent disks Computer Hybrid vehicle Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Education in Romania CPU design Propaedeutic value of Esperanto MAME Contract bridge Education in Singapore 1957 World Series Education in Australia Strap-on dildo Apple Macintosh Economics Prostate cancer CPU cache Sweatshop Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Illegal drug trade Stars!

question about being and in the th grade well basically i'm and i've had hip surgeries i was homeschooled for years and i didn't do that well now i'm and in the th grade i lost my grandpa so i'm also suffering with that i'm going to be in the same grade as my brother and i'm gonna be around a bunch of year olds not with growing up i don't think this is gonna go so well and how am i going to deal with the teachers am i going to be ridiculed listen you are going to be fine you have been through a lot and you're still kickin' take a deep breath and think about what you want to get out of th grade well of course you want to get caught up academically and that may go better than you imagine hey brain biology is on your side i'm serious as you get each year older your brain is better able to handle the whole learning studying thing even if you haven't been in regular school so give that a chance next even though at you are a little older th grade is full of kids who are and not just you birthdays falling during the summer mean that some kids start kindergarten a year later than others so they will be older than i hope that as a family you guys have talked about this your brother should be thinking about ways he can make things easier for you like not advertising your personal business and by acting cool with the whole situation now hear this i am so sorry for your loss many of us have lost our grandparents and it stinks but think of your grandpa as watching over you now when you are in a pinch or feeling nervous think stick with me here grandpa and help me do this that's ok that's part of how you can honor his memory your teachers should not have any problems about your situation they should only be thinking about helping you learn and i think that's what you will see be a good listener show respect and you will win them over remember that your school has a counselor who you can talk to if you get to feeling overwhelmed but i think anyone who has stood as much as you have can take on th grade chin up stand tall and i know you will do fine  Hey Arnold!

what do i do if my dad is teaching me at my school this year and i feel a little embarrassed i taught both of my children in high school it can be done here are a few things we did to keep it smooth i was clear that i would be just a hair rougher on them than on their classmates so that there would never be backlash on them from other students we were clear that they should avoid using our relationship because they would pay for it with their peers came up with something for them to call me other than dad as it turned out one of their classes dveloped a nickname for me so they could use that as easily as anyone what happens at home stays at home no okay you remember what we talked about at supper last night the basic is that your parent shouldn't give you special treatment and you shouldn't try to get it and if he's a little extra hard on you after class your classmates will be patting you on the back and saying dude i'm so sorry which is not so bad and you and your dad can work your stuff out at home  The Adventures of Pete & Pete Social rule Great Teacher Onizuka The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Azumanga Daioh Education in the United States One Tree Hill (TV series) Danish Folkeskole Education Hey Jude Pitaten Hikikomori Dog training Boston Public Dad's Army Graduate school Saved by the Bell Stomach cancer For Better or For Worse Homeschooling Kim Possible Theory of conduct The Magic School Bus Marty McFly Calvin and Hobbes Beavis and Butt-head Grandview, U.S.A.

how can i fight the school board's hair color policy our local school board does not allow students with 'unnatural' hair colors i think this is grossly unfair and sends a very negative message to our kids does anyone have any practical advice about how to force the school board to admit my daughter is there a good way to challenge the legal basis of the school board's authority if we expect our children to respect others we must start by respecting them control of one's own hair color is not much to ask my daughter is an advanced student with an excellent record i am amazed at the number of people answering who think following rules more important than common sense how easily we relinquish our freedoms you can't nor should you teach your child the lesson that sometimes you have to adhere to the rules especially as a child it will be a valuable lesson when she makes it out into the workforce and it's much easier to learn it now than later on perhaps you may need to learn it too perhaps you need to reflect on the negative message that you may be sending to your daughter some battles should be fought this is not even remotely one of those it's a vanity issue pure and simple  Education in Japan Teach the Controversy Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Separation of church and state IP (complexity) Ethics Intelligent design movement A Course In Miracles NAACP Homeschooling Waldorf Education Creation and evolution in public education Scientology beliefs and practices Current teachings of Prem Rawat Abington School District v.

attention kindergarten teachers what should my child know i have a little girl starting kindgergarten and i have no idea what she should know i've had everyone tell me that kindergarten's not like when you were a kid and kindergarten is the new st grade she'll be going to a highly rated school with high academic expectations i've tried looking on the school's website but there's nothing specific she knows her address still working on learning her phone number but then again i have trouble remembering my phone number she can write her name still has trouble with some letters she can count to by s counts to about unassisted working on counting backward from to she knows most of her letter sounds and we've been practicing reading beginner books every day we've been working with learning money values a dime is worth pennies etc she knows the days of the week but then i see kids her age who are rattling off stuff like the dinosaurs lived million years ago this one is a pleiosaurus she has some pre k and k workbooks i've stayed at home with her she's never been in daycare or preschool and they have things like maps of the us and skeletons with the bones labeled is this stuff i should be working with her on back in my day you needed to know your alphabet and colors i don't want her to be at a disadvantage your child will be fine a student will usually succeed in kindergarten if she knows the names sounds and can form most of her letters they will learn all of this in kindergarten but there is a huge difference in the children who can do some all ready and those who can do none it sounds like your daughter is on the right track counting is also important it's great that she can count to thirty and backwards from i don't think she will need to know all that much about money perhaps just identifying the coins and how much each one is worth that is a good place for her to start if they learn more than that in kindergarten she will have a good basis and be able to pick up on it more easily than a child who doesn't know anything about coins the only other things i think she needs to be able to do before being absolutely ready for kindergarten are social behaviors if she has not been in any kind of prek program this may be tricky for you to figure out but she needs to be able to interact with other kids follow directions sit still pay attention keep on task for about minutes maybe more and be able to separate from you and be comfortable in her new environment if she can do that she is going to be just fine it seems like you really care about how successful she is and have been working a lot with her don't worry about those kids who can spit out all kinds of facts about dinosaurs and the solar system they are typically boys and really interested in those topics so they have lots of books toys games etc about them and memorize all of that information it has no correlation to whether or not they are ready for kindergarten  Kindergarten Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Japan Education Avenue Q Microeconomics Education in Germany Education in Taiwan Second language acquisition Social rule Education in Hong Kong Homeschooling Dog training Dyslexia Extreme Programming Fischer Random Chess A Course In Miracles Grade (education) Computer JumpStart Asperger syndrome Aerial (dance move) Mnemonic Password Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Saved by the Bell Education in Australia CPU cache Theory of conduct Hikikomori Economics Entropy Surveillance Recess (TV series) Laura Schlessinger Objective-C Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Cognitive science Contract bridge Infantilism Milton H.

boarding school prep school private school i'll be attending mercersburg academy mercersburg is supposed to be an excellent boarding school with a large endowment i was just curious to hear about other boarding schools ps have you heard anything about mercersburg what do you think of people who attend private boarding school zach i am a mercersburg alumnus i graduated in the s you are correct it is an excellent boarding school and they continue to improve the school campus and the programs offered the campus still maintains its natural old school beauty while staying up to date with all the latest technology it also has a vibrant arts community if you're into that also the athletics are top tier i might also mention that the small town environment makes for an idyllic setting what i like best about mercersburg is its rich history every time i go back there i learn something new about the campus its alumni or its past visitors also no matter where you go in life you will always be a part of the mercersburg community i went back for alumni weekend last year and it was as though i had never left as for what i think about people who attend private boarding school i think they are pretty much like public schoolers except that they are mostly self motivated students who typically have another talent besides academics or they seek to develop one i found that unlike my experience at public school i didn't stand out as an academic elite in private school this was good for me because it motivated me to do better and surrounded me with kids who were as smart or smarter many of whom were willing to work with me to understand some of the more difficult concepts it was truly an academic community one other difference between public and private school is that you are instructed in private school but not baby sat they will not take your hand and make sure you are in class on time you are simply expected to do so all the time public schools spend baby sitting you is time spent on academics in private school that was refreshing to me one more thing that prep school does for you it leaves you with a sense that you will do something great with your life that you are equipped to take on the world and or that you are going to change it for the better of course there are no guarantees but it's a great start i hope this helps good luck at mercersburg and email me if you have any specific questions go blue  Education in the United States The Hill School Caulfield Grammar School Johns Hopkins University Independent school (UK) University of Virginia University of Connecticut American University University of Southern California University-preparatory school SAT Homeschooling College Georgetown University Education in Japan University of Alabama Ivy League High school University of Central Florida Graduate school Phillips Exeter Academy University of Michigan Shreveport, Louisiana Duke University Virginia Military Institute University of California, Irvine Purdue University St. Ignatius College Prep Vanderbilt University Columbia University Affirmative action Education in Germany Carnegie Mellon University Tulane University Education in the People's Republic of China University of California, Los Angeles Massachusetts Institute of Technology University of Houston Pennsylvania State University Cornell University Florida State University Anglo-Chinese School United States Naval Academy University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill The Citadel (Military College) University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Emerson College Education in Malaysia College and university rankings Franklin W.

would it be strange for me to run for asb this year last year i ran and lost by one vote to a senior he has graduated so i'm thinking of running again should i or would that be weird not at all weird you will never succeed if you give up after your near misses if you had not gotten any votes at all or lost by a landslide i might say that you would be beating your head against a wall to run again but under your current circumstances i think it is the right thing to do you do need to realize though that others might run this year who didn't run last so there is no guarantee you would win this time but if you ever want to win you have to run  Carolina Panthers New York Giants Bowl Championship Series Cincinnati Bengals Hubert H.

is there anything i should know i about high school i'm starting high school on tuesday and i was just wondering if there's anything i should know there will be cliques there will be crappy teachers and not so great people but you just have to roll with the punches manage your time well so you don't get behind on work but be sure to have fun stick with people you know but don't be afraid to branch out join a couple of clubs or try out some sports try not to get caught up in the petty drama you most likely will be involved in some no one gets out of high school without it but it will also show you who your real friends are in the process also homecoming is one of the funnest parts of the year whether you're popular or not if your school is like mine and makes class floats for the homecoming parade get involved in that so much fun when it comes to teachers don't be a total kiss ass but also don't be someone they're always yelling at some teachers just don't like certain kids for no reason but you can't let it effect you but then there are teachers who you will click with and can be a great help beyond the year that you have them don't let whatever negative answers you may get bother you all in all there will be some tough times but there will be some great times four years goes by fast so make the best of it if you're lucky you'll make some really great friends along the way who will be there past high school good luck  The Adventures of Pete & Pete Recurring South Park characters Yearbook The Amazing Race Saved by the Bell Social rule Azumanga Daioh Homecoming (tradition) Tai Chi Chuan Columbine High School massacre Homecoming (song) Marching band Joke Saturday Night Live Lynbrook High School Rod Stewart Kyle Broflovski Sid Vicious Ferris Bueller's Day Off The Ashlee Simpson Show Piccolo Junior Saga Paul Levesque Football Married... with Children Roddy Piper The Marshall Mathers LP One Tree Hill (TV series) Recess (TV series) Game show Care Bears The Karate Kid, Part III The Fairly OddParents Viva La Bam Diving Baylor University Shawn Michaels Boston Public Kodocha Avenue Q Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Dawson's Creek Ja Rule Tournament of Roses Parade The Beach Boys Sky High (2005 film) Milton H.

should i have an associates in science becoming an lpn i am becoming an lpn but there are different programs i came across becoming a practical nurse or getting an associates in science with lpn whats the difference which one should i do and why read over the programs your reading again i bet that one of them is a diploma program preparing students to become an lpn lvn it should last about a year the associates would be a program that prepares lpns to become rns and would last a year or so it would require that you are already an lpn when you enter and are upgrading your certification to rn if it is an associates degree for you to initially become an lpn i can think of no good reason not to become an rn in the same amount of time  Nurse Education in Hong Kong Education in Portugal Associate's degree Master's degree Community college Juris Doctor Athabasca University Teacher Lawyer IB Diploma Programme High school Physician Paralegal City and Guilds of London Institute Education in Australia College Medical school Australian Qualifications Framework GED Registered Nurse Graduate school Education in the Republic of Ireland Memorial University of Newfoundland Education in Germany Education in the United States Education in Finland University of Phoenix Physical therapy Certified Nursing Assistant General practitioner Pretty Good Privacy College admissions Software engineering Georgetown University Education in Malaysia Academic degree Bachelor of Arts Homeschooling Indian Institutes of Management Kwantlen University College Higher education in Japan Education in Taiwan Education in France Visual Basic __cole Polytechnique UCAS Advanced Placement Program Education in Canada Simon Fraser University University of Maryland Baltimore County Education in Romania Seneca College Barrister California Baptist University Universiti Putra Malaysia Social work New York State Department of Education University of British Columbia Education Ayurveda Concordia University Graduation Teen Girl Squad Podiatrist Duke University Mapua Institute of Technology University of North Carolina at Charlotte Nurse anesthetist No Child Left Behind Act Northeastern University, Boston Far Eastern University Johns Hopkins University Betting (poker) Education in Sweden CPU cache Turing machine Purdue University Scientology beliefs and practices Missouri Academy of Science, Mathematics and Computing Virginia Commonwealth University Object-oriented programming Sonoma State University Accountancy Smith College University of Hawaii at Manoa The College of New Jersey The Catholic University of America Conscription Medical University of South Carolina Junior Certificate Open University Law school University of Central Florida Master of Laws Quizbowl A-level Education in Austria

i'm in trouble i want to be in the academy of finance for an internship but it will lower my gpa confused i'm entering th grade ok so there is this special program at my high school called teh academy of finance i am thinking of joining it the requirement is that i think maybe an interview but the problem is that i also have to take a bunch of business related required courses in order to get in the academy and therefore get a cool internship as well as taking a more prestigious co op course in my senior year problem the electives are and will lower my gpa a bit then i have this other guy who is my competitor who is taking both pap algebra and geometry pap at the same year and since pap courses are they will really raise his average and mine will lower as i have to take a bcis course this year in order to get into the academy my question is is the academy good and actually worth sacrificing a high gpa or should i forget about the academy and go all out gpa and give that guy a run for his money if i'm in the academy there is no way i can become valedictorian with all the business courses that are required my gpa will significantly lower but if don't do the academy i can still take some business courses miss the internship but i have a way better chance to become valedictorian salutarian higher gpa overall what should i do should i copy the ohter guy and take pap geometry and algebra or do you think i am biting off more than i can chew and suffocate last year in th grade i had all pap classes and band and my lowest ever report card grade was a and my final yearly lowest grade was a and two of my classes i got averages in for the whole year do you think i should double up on math courses or do the academy of finance and just let the other guy become valedictorian as i heard he is extremley smart as well grrrr i'm having such a dilema and the counselor didn't help much either first off you got to go with what will make you happy if grades are your goal go for that if this business is fun for you and a passion go for that if you are wondering about college i would think the internship will be far better than being valedictorian once you are in college your high school gpa will not mean a thing but the experience from an internship will get you alot farther plus if you get a gpa on the regular scale it will look better than a weighted scale gpa when i was in high school i had the opportunity to do college courses they lowered my gpa and i was not valedictorian i am in the honors program in my college and doing great grades are not the end all beat all in life it will be your experience that makes the difference go for what makes you happy oh just make sure that this program will still give you all the prep you need for a college education sometimes these programs are meant for people that are not meant to go to college and prepares them for a job right out of highschool  Education in Germany Education in Romania High school Law school Education in the People's Republic of China College admissions Affirmative action Phillips Exeter Academy Advanced Placement Program Secondary education in the United States Education in Taiwan SAT National Certificate of Educational Achievement United States Academic Decathlon College Master's degree __cole Polytechnique Education in Hong Kong Dr. Michael M.

im going into my first year of middle school any tips th grade was pretty cool for me you get to do a whole lot of new stuff like you get lockers and different teachers depending on your school you don't get recess which wasn't a big deal to anybody in my school here are a couple tips that i could think of dont run to your classes there is no need for you to run at all unless you are extremely late running everywhere will just make you seem more like a franticky little th grader don't act like your all that just because you're in middle school now you really aren't any of that don't smart off to the older kids or try to say something to make you look smart or funny you may be smart in your grade but most of the older kids are smarter than you and don't remind them of the rules or tell them not to be mean or anything then they really get annoyed mostly if you stay quiet around the older kids occasionally talking about how you didn't like this teacher or something then they will like you and take you under their wing don't try to stand up to any of the older kids there really aren't any bullies that take your lunch money or whatever but some kids do like to use words to get to you if someone is bothering you don't try to act tough and stand up to them go tell a teacher or write a statement in the dean's office have fun and try not to get involved in a lot of drama trust me theres a whole ton of drama in middle school and if you steer clear of the drama queens you'll be happy you're only like years old you dont need to start dating yet you may think you're mature enough but you're really not you have plenty of time in high school middle school dating is really just some kids who say they are going out but really all they do is walk around occasionally holding hands but they never actually go on dates well there you go that's all the stuff i could think of that annoyed me about th graders last year but that was just that particular th grade class they usually aren't that terribly annoying th graders will be ok with you cuz they were you last year but th graders seem to get more agitated about th graders so just stay out of their hair have fun  Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Saved by the Bell Recurring South Park characters Social rule Humphrey Bogart The Fairly OddParents 2000 Australian Grand Prix EastEnders Doug Shaggy dog story Azumanga Daioh Kodocha Codename: Kids Next Door Recess (TV series) The Adventures of Pete & Pete Theory of conduct Murdock-Portal Elementary School Poker jargon Columbine High School massacre Education in the United States The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Garfield Great Teacher Onizuka Teachers (film) The Ashlee Simpson Show Russian joke Trailer Park Boys Bully Milton H.

whats the best binder for a freshman in high school one thatll keep me organize and thatll fit in my bookbag i have always found it easiest to have one three ring binder with binder paper this way you can add paper if you need to to make your binder organized divide the sections for different classes with plastic dividers ones with pockets are the best because you may need to store loose papers your teacher gives you i like the one binder approach because you only have one and it has everything in it it makes life so much easier i am not in high school anymore i am currently in college but i'm still using this approach  Paper size Ceramics Student Tablet Clarinet Oscilloscope Pastel Floppy disk Chromatography Fiberglass Yearbook Microsoft Office Vermicompost Teen Girl Squad Franklin W.

what is your opinion on combining classes in a private school the classes are very small and they have combined the th and th grades at my daughters school i love the school and what it stands for but i don't care for combined classes i am afraid i will have to move her next year it is could be a matter of money two teachers are cheaper than one sometimes it is a matter of shortage of rooms at other times which is the most likely according to the way that your question is worded the groups in the th and th grade are just too small to be viable i agree that combined classes are generally not good i would make an exception if there was an extraordinary teacher who would not have difficulty in handling and even taking advantage of that situation if you have not already done so ask your daughter what differences if any there are before and after class combination you can also visit the school and observe the class by yourself other parents may feel the same way as you do meet with the principal headmaster and explain your disappointment and the fact that you and others may not have a choice she may at this point promise to maintain the separate classes by grade in the meantime be prepared visit other schools find out their costs and see if you and your daughter would be happy there  Graduate school Japanese tea ceremony Microeconomics Education in Germany Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban No Child Left Behind Act Pitaten Theory of conduct Secondary education in France French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Education in Romania Abortion debate Independent school (UK) Philosophical skepticism GED Pledge of Allegiance Education in Australia Paradox The Catcher in the Rye Contract Primary education Prostate cancer SAT Education Grade (education) Consensus decision-making Current teachings of Prem Rawat Alexander Technique Education in Hong Kong Appeal Everwood Economics Separation of church and state in the United States Fathers' rights Code: Lyoko Economic inequality Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Polyamory Great Teacher Onizuka Boston Public Acts of the Apostles Sant Thakar Singh High school Tripartite System Sydney Riot of 1879 Public-key cryptography Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Kodocha Education in Japan Surreal number Hogwarts Species Secondary education in Japan Scouting Infantilism Coming of Age (TNG episode) Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Moral Politics Education in Portugal Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Education in Malaysia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Socrates Expert system Ghostwriter (television series) Creationism School choice The Amber Spyglass Law of value The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe IB Diploma Programme Health insurance Monarchy in Canada Publicly funded medicine Homeschooling Galactic Civilizations Separation of church and state Brown v.

why is it that naughty students who mark around are more smarter than the students who always listens well from what i have seen there is a certain breed of children who fall into the category you refer to these are basically gifted or exceptionally smart pupils i have studied their behaviour generally and many of them do not work hard as you said they have fun and do well easily and perhaps this is why they don't see the need to sit down and study but you have to realize that sometimes it's not just complacency these students have a different internal mentality they are more interested in how things work in finding out stuff they are actually interested in etc they can go on for ours playing with little figurines despite being teenagers or spend ages assembling little robots they have the patience and drive to do it but when it comes to studying sometimes they just feel bored by it all that's why certain schools have gifted classes to challenege these kids nonetheless many of these kids don't want to study endlessly they get stuff easily this is of course a small proportion of those who don't study the rest just flunk if you notice this group i speak of is like the top percent of the world intellectually many people will feel threatened by them but get to know them and you'll see they are normal people with slightly different characters they are more outgoing social and confident a far cry from those who do well because they sit and study all day it's frustrating many of us know what you mean just have to bare with them but also realize that that's just the way they are  Asperger syndrome Education in the United States Gifted Beavis and Butt-head Humphrey Bogart The Catcher in the Rye Autism Education in the People's Republic of China Intelligence quotient Social rule Stuttering Education in Singapore Education Dyslexia Brian Griffin Undergrads Volleyball Time Out of Mind One Tree Hill (TV series) Saved by the Bell Tai Chi Chuan Gifted Education Programme (Singapore) Microeconomics Kim Possible The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Graduate school Teen Girl Squad FLCL The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Child sexuality Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder About a Boy Martial art Esperanto as an international language Adolescence The O.C.

international baccalaureate is it worth it i'm debating on taking full ib or just partial ib for my next three years of high schoo do you think that full ib is worth it in regards to hours spent on homework and difficulty level did it pay off in the end or if you only did partial ib classes were you glad that you didn't take full ib thanks so much for any help im in ib and i say don't only some colleges actually look at it it's just more work you'll never have any time for social activities and your stuck in a class with the same people for the whole day hmm in my opinion consider something else  IB Diploma Programme Education in Romania Education in France Juris Doctor Education in the United States Secondary education in France A-level Graduate school Middle class Test (student assessment) Sydney Riot of 1879 University of Houston Education in Australia Education in Japan Grade (education) Education in the People's Republic of China Unemployment Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Caulfield Grammar School Mutual fund Emergency Medical Services Education in Singapore Secondary education in the United States Blonde on Blonde Hidden Markov model Working time Saved by the Bell Economic inequality Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME GED Anglo-Chinese School United World Colleges College admissions Debate Hunter College High School Franklin W.

i'm going into middle school help please have any advice about the beginning of middle im freaking out about making new friends since i mite transfer different schools fights i get really scared when i see fights cliques being made fun of not being liked getting beat up and scared of theft help me plz i dont wanna worry forever take a deep breath middle school will be fine almost everyone freaks out about middle school right before they start it and when they get to middle school they realize that there was really nothing to freak out about let's go quickly through your list of fears you mentioned transfering to a new school with middle school everyone is starting out at a new school the kids they spent their entire elementary school career with may or may not be at the middle school that they are going to think of it as an opportunity to make new friends talk to kids on the school bus or on the walk to school talk to kids in the hallway who you may have seen in class hey don't we have math together or whatever join a club or a sport team to make new friends there are so many ways to make new friends the great thing about middle school is that there are so many different types of people there that everyone fits in somewhere and once you find the place where you fit you will see that making friends is no big deal as for a new school try and go to an orientation at the new school if they do not have a formal orientation have your parents set up a campus tour visit the campus take a look inside the classrooms find out where the lockers are if they have them and that sort of thing get a map of the school and once you find out your classes circle where your classes are on the map if you have a chance to get a glimpse of the campus and meet the teachers before school starts you will find it much easier to be on such an unfamiliar campus one of the other concerns that you mentioned is fights unfortunately school violence is something that you can't escape from the simple rule when you see a fight break out is to tell a staff member teacher or otherwise immediately if one isn't already on scene and then walk in the other direction don't be an on looker and hang out to see who wins don't take sides or try and get involved if it doesn't involve you simply walk away most of the time the people fighting on a school campus especially in middle school have a beef to pick with each other if you are not the one that they are picking the beef with then stay out of it being made fun of happens to everyone whether it's your hair color your size whether or not you wear glasses or whatever else everyone gets picked on sooner or later the important thing to remember is to just be yourself and don't try and be someone you are not the same goes for fitting in with cliques if you try to pretend to be someone you are not everyone will think you are phony and no one will want anything to do with you at all and then they really will pick on you just be yourself and make friends with the people who like the real you as for everyone else don't worry about them there's no law that says you have to get along with everyone in middle school as for getting beat up don't start fights and stay out of the middle of fights that don't involve you if you do that oh and watch your mouth don't run potty mouth by calling people names cussing a lot and that sort of thing then you will not get beat up for the most part people in middle school only beat up people for a specific reason not just random poundings finally with the theft thing if you have a locker use it and don't give out your combination to anyone not even your best friend by yourself a master lock combination lock if the school doesn't provide one and make sure that you keep the combination written down in a safe place in case you forget what it is even if you keep your locker locked at all times don't keep money cell phone ipod palm or other expensive items in your locker instead keep these items in your backpack don't ever let your backpack out of your sight even for a moment and try not to take items to school that you don't need at school relax everything is going to be fine middle school is a whole new adventure compared to elementary school but it's certainly not the end of the world  Columbine High School massacre Social rule The Inside The Amazing Race Kodocha The Fairly OddParents Shaggy dog story Saved by the Bell Professional wrestling match types RuneScape quests Great Teacher Onizuka Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Avenue Q Jon Secada Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Ed, Edd n Eddy One Tree Hill (TV series) Surveillance Aerial (dance move) Code: Lyoko Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Vegeta Ocean's Twelve Tag RuneScape Syphon Filter About a Boy Tai Chi Chuan The Catcher in the Rye Futurama (TV series -

does anyone have tips for high school im going into a very catty all girl school any tips for getting through the first year also there is this guy going to my brother school he is very clingy to me and i dont like him at all how should i deal with that as for high school make sure that you get into a good group of friends right away you want to be able to focus on your education and you want to find friends who have the same level of dedication if there are any extra curricular clubs at your school i suggest participating they are a great way to meet people with similar interests and look great on college applications one important thing is to be confident in yourself find friends who build up your confidence and don't get caught up in what anybody else says be proud to be different as you go through your high school career you will find that you need a strong support team to help you through the rough times and to celebrate with you during your proudest moments if your friends don't support you then they aren't your friends if your friends influence you to do bad things then they aren't your friends friends end up being one of the most important things in high school because they are your support staff you should be able to call any of your friends at am in the morning because something terrible has happened as long as you don't do it too often if your friends lie to you or hide things form you or if they don't make the effort to spend time with you then forget about them they aren't your friends also this is a time when you're going to want to stop talking to your parents don't do it your parents most likely have a lot of wisdom and they'll be happy to share it you don't have to tell them everything but if you tell them about the major and some minor things going on in your life they'll appreciate it a lot and i've found from experience moms are almost always right as for the boy ask yourself why he is clingy to you are you just friends does he want to be more than friends try to lessen the amount of time you spend with him without being obvious that you're trying to get rid of him if he asks to hang out say that you were looking forward to watching a movie with your parents tonight or some other rare family activity you can also plan to go out with only your female friends and if he asks to come along you can say sorry girls only another solution bury yourself in your studies and say that you need to focus on your education first i wish you luck on entering high school it is a difficult and rewarding period of your life  Theory of conduct Social rule Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Good Morning, Vietnam Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) RuneScape quests About a Boy Milton H.

what is the difference between ap classes and other classes for high school i'm going to be a high school senior and i'm from a small town my school does not offer ap classes is there really a difference between regular and ap classes what if i decided to take the highest classes offered is it the same so far i'm hopefully taking calculus world history and english iv ap classes if you take the ap test at the end of the school year and you get a passable grade that the college you're going to accepts you will get college credit for taking the class in high school that means you won't have to take the class in college if it's a class for your major or one of the required classes you have to take anyways even if you don't take the class in high school you can still opt to take the ap test at a different high school at the end of the year and still pass it and still get credit for the class the scores on the test do not transfer over in gpa for college a friend of mine wasn't in ap classes but he still took the tests and got college credit for them i have no idea what the international baccularette sp does i'm not sure if you get college credit for it or not but i know it looks good on your transcripts if you really want college credit before going to college i'd recommend buying ap books fairly cheap on amazon reading them and then taking the ap test at a different high school  Graduate school Grade (education) Advanced Placement Program Education in the United States Education in Germany GED SAT College admissions National Certificate of Educational Achievement High school Secondary education in the United States Law school Education in the People's Republic of China Hunter College High School Education in Taiwan Community college Stuyvesant High School Education in Romania Ontario Academic Credit Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Medical school Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Education in Malaysia Education The Citadel (Military College) Affirmative action New Trier High School Test (student assessment) Lynbrook High School A-level Credit card No Child Left Behind Act Law School Admissions Test English cricket team Kwantlen University College Education in Australia Phillips Exeter Academy Yale Law School University of Central Florida Jaime Escalante Standardized testing College Worcester Polytechnic Institute Independent school (UK) Cricket Mutual fund Physician Cooper Union College Board Contract bridge History of Test cricket (to 1883) Yearbook Education in Sweden Middle Tennessee State University U.S. Electoral College Education in Canada Extreme Programming Brown University Hopkins School Rugby union Saved by the Bell Franklin W.

should a year old student be kicked out of school or extra curricular activities just because of a tattoo school policy dictates no illegal activity gang activity or cult tattoo allowed she has a triquetra representing balance of mind body and spirit she has been on honor roll very involved in school academics and athletics and they want to kick her out of everything i am her mother if i am not throwing a fit they should not it is not visible unless they are watching her undress it is between her shoulder blades and is only about inches diameter what does ink have to do with obtaining an education i agree school is for learning education and discipline and if tattoos set a bad example then the staff should not have them either it is on her back and not able to be seen unless people are watching her dress undress she did not set out to disobey any rule we were not even aware it was in the policy until today and it specifies what is not allowed she is not a gang member nor a wannabe she did not get it as a cult it was researched and indicates balance of mind body and spirit and the circle of life as for parental consent in this day and time i am sure we are all aware things can be done without actual consent i would rather partake in the choices and artist than her go underground and get some disease since a triquetra can be a symbol of anything from the trinity to paganism to a cultic symbol i would advise being careful on how you approach this with the school administration i understand that to her it symbolizes balance but it has been used in a huge number of ways and can easily be misinterpreted there could be any number of reasons they have a problem with it just plain ignorance it could be that it's a symbol they don't understand and they are hesitant to allow her to have it in school if this is the case i would have research available to show exactly what it is to her and why she chose to get that particular tattoo since she is very involved and on honor roll it's likely that she is able to communicate well in writing and or face to face if they will allow her to present her case and she can do so objectively and without getting upset this may do a lot to sway them they may have had problems with students with tatts in the past if so see if something can be worked out is she willing to keep it covered while on school grounds and school events sports they're afraid of backlash and just trying to cover their butts but they're being overzealous about it document her past involvement and the fact that she is not a trouble maker the tatt was a symbolic thing that is important to her symbolizing her priority of staying balanced in life as neither she nor you knew about the rule and she hasn't made a point of flaunting it hopefully her record will speak for itself ink can have something to do with obtaining an education depending on the school they may have adapted a zero tolerance policy in an effort to keep it from becoming a fad a contest between the kids or an area that accepts gang activity unfortunately because they have a responsibility to provide a safe and disciplined environment for all the students it may be a measure they felt they had to take in your daughter's case as long as she is respectful in taking on any requirements they may have in keeping it covered and keeping her grades and involvement where they have been it's likely that they may be willing to make an exception  Theory of conduct Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Scientology beliefs and practices Alexander Technique Tai Chi Chuan Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses GED Mixed martial arts French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Social rule Graduate school Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe A Course In Miracles Contract Infantilism Sigmund Freud Economics Mahjong Children of God Social psychology Reiki Cult Volleyball Separation of church and state Password Education in the People's Republic of China Equine conformation Martial art Polyamory Electrophysiology Philosophy of mathematics Sento Abortion in the United States Education in Portugal University of Bristol Abortion debate Philosophy of language Fathers' rights Football (soccer) Surveillance Marching band Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Aerial (dance move) Asperger syndrome Milton H.

is it normal to be scared im just entering high school and im so scared that some nights i cant sleep isit that scary when u enter ninth grade what can i do to get rid of that fear the key to getting over being scared of high school is to get involved whether that is a club or a sport believe or not you are not the only freshman having these fears once the first day of school comes and goes you will feel much better it is a change going from middle school where you might change classes twice in a day have maybe different teachers and a light homework load i am sure you will be fine not sure what it is exactly that you are afraid of but maybe it will help you to make a list of what scares you about going to high school then next to each fear try to think of something to counteract it for example if the high school has over a thousand students and you are worried you will not find your classes try to go the week before school to familiarize yourself with the school's layout good luck  Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Yearbook Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Education in the United States FoxTrot Grade (education) One Tree Hill (TV series) Hunter College High School Graduate school Lynbrook High School Singlish Cardcaptor Sakura Shaggy dog story Phillips Exeter Academy Brown University Stuyvesant High School High school Full Metal Panic?

whats high school like high school for me so far it's confusing in middle school they prepared us for life to be so much harder and way more hectic but i was overprepared and way stressed out and laughed about it later i'm not saying academically it will be a piece of cake it is harder than middle school but if you study and do your homework you should be okay socially for me there wasn't much drama we got most of it out in middle school it's still there but it's mostly among the people that have yet to realize petty rivalries and he said she said doesn't matter i kinda felt like i was distanced from my best friend because we didn't have any classes together but we're still friends now because we call each other and stuff peer pressure it's there but you shouldn't have to listen to it stuff like you should only shop at aeropostale or you need to have the latest cell phone doesn't matter because it's all material and about what you want not what you need to fit in with a certain group of people there kind of is pressure to start a relationship with someone but you really don't need to listen to it unless you want to start a relationship i seriously doubt that you will be looked down upon for not being in a romantic relationship i wasn't if there are people that do tease you for it well they don't have their priorities in order there are some of those in every high school they need a zillion relationships for a reason the best thing to remember is just to be yourself your true friends will love you for it others will admire you for it and you'll be the better person for it it will keep you sane and down to earth in a time that may seem hectic and confusing ps if you're wondering why i seem to answer all your questions well yahoo answers sends me an e mail when you ask one so i answer it i'm not stalking you or anything lol  Theory of conduct The Ashlee Simpson Show Time Out of Mind Social rule Shaggy dog story Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Friends Plame affair Saved by the Bell God Emperor of Dune Piccolo Junior Saga Blood on the Tracks Theodicy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Transactional analysis One Tree Hill (TV series) Singlish Kim Possible The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Philosophical skepticism Anne Boleyn She Loves You Sexual orientation Philosophy of language Douglas Adams Avenue Q Little Britain 2000 Australian Grand Prix Empire Burlesque Calvin and Hobbes Education in the People's Republic of China The Apprentice 2 Culture of Lithuania Current teachings of Prem Rawat Surveillance The Emancipation of Mimi Rei Ayanami Radio Yerevan Taxi Driver Ex-gay Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Deconstruction StarCraft Episode VI Cliff Richard The Amber Spyglass W.I.T.C.H.

have you had any experience with a smart board in school if so what is your opinion on it our school uses smart boards throughout the building and any helpful feedback i could get would be appreciated i had a smartboard in my classroom and hope to have it again this year i am moving into a different room and it is supposed to come with me but you know how that can be it is integrated into all my lesson plans having an interactive board that everyone can use and see is fantastic it does take some time to create lessons on the computer to use the smartboard but then they are there to use over and over again in my opinion every classroom should have an interactive white board regardless of the brand name although the literature says that you can use it as a normal white board be careful if you don't erase the dry erase marker off at the end of the day it can be difficult to get off and could leave ghosting requiring additional cleaning i also find that keeping the projector set up can be a problem with wires all over the place which increases the chance that the projector computer could be pulled off the table if someone trips on the wires we are supposed to be getting the projectors installed in the ceiling to avoid the wires being strewn everywhere  Interactive whiteboard Surveillance Raffles Institution Digital circuit Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Loudspeaker Social rule PLATO Alexander Technique Typewriter TGV Trip distribution Out-of-body experience Teach the Controversy Poker jargon Film Requirements analysis Whiteboard The Giver Wire wrap Drill bit IMAX Hopkins School Prostate cancer Integrated circuit IPod Backgammon Emerson College Hamster Betting (poker) Debugging Classroom Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Modem Electrical wiring Computer and video game genres Hash table Knife Route assignment Spark plug Alternating current Teacher Massachusetts Institute of Technology Linked list Normal distribution Projection screen Sound recording Computer virus Mouse (computing) Robot Lesson StarCraft Secret Missions Software testing Bluetooth Audiophile Extreme Programming Francis Crick Kasparov versus The World Magic: The Gathering Motion capture Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Windows Vista Circuit design Education in the United States Fischer Random Chess Drawing Geodesic dome Central processing unit Go (board game) Database management system Urinary incontinence Japanese tea ceremony PID controller Light gun SS Morro Castle Bristol Grammar School Gas metal arc welding Franklin W.

how do you save time on school mornings to save time in the morning on those hectic school days i typically take my showers at night and lay out the clothes and shoes that i'm going to wear the next day the night before sometimes i have to skip breakfast unfortunately so i make sure i have a granola bar or something quick on the counter for me to grab on my way to school well once in a while being late is okay but everyday its not so okay first thing i would ask you to think to yourself is are wasting time at any point like getting glued in front of the tv or fixing that one strand of hair if not and you are free of distractions then i would say if you have issues that your hair needs to be perfect do some stuff before sleeping like blow drying for instance or straightening next if you are just short on time then wake up earlier by minutes and see how that works unless u keep hitting the snooze button often i had the same issue as you so i just wake up earlier i do shower at night and lay out my clothes definately makes things easier hope you get better good luck  Sin City Breakfast Textile manufacturing Clothing Violin Bubble Bobble 2000 Australian Grand Prix Aerial (dance move) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Characters in the Smurfs Shaggy dog story Pitaten DisneySpeak Treehouse of Horror XV Volleyball Phoebe Buffay's songs Super Mario Bros. 3 Kitchen Curling Professional wrestling match types Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Floppy disk Japanese toilet USS Tunny (SS-282) Charles Goodyear Social aspects of clothing Oh My Goddess!

which teacher did you respect the most and why did you or do you have a favourite teacher at school why did you like them the best i had a high school teacher don olson who was undoubtedly the best teacher i ever had he had such a cavalier blunt attitude that always commanded respect in the 's he once punched out a student that threatened him with a knife when he sensed the class was spacing out he'd turn on one of the bunsen burner valves and ignite it shooting a jet of flame across the room he would occasionally bring in liquid nitrogen freeze stuff and shatter it just because he knew we liked it and we always learned so much so easily from him when you find yourself looking forward to a class you naturally pay more attention and soak things up much more readily  Bunsen burner Portable stove Internal combustion engine Explosive material Team Fortress Classic Bong Beavis and Butt-head Shaggy dog story Martial art Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Piccolo Junior Saga Tenshinhan Tai Chi Chuan Flamethrower Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Tier One Lithium Nitrogen YuYu Hakusho Carburetor Thermostat Transformers: Cybertron Static (superhero) Turbojet Azumanga Daioh Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Professional wrestling attacks Glossary of firefighting equipment Fuel injection Wick effect Japanese tea ceremony Furnace Columbine High School massacre Thermal power station The Smoking Room Space shuttle main engine Education in Germany Rubidium Great Teacher Onizuka STS-62 Invader Zim Molotov cocktail The Adventures of Pete & Pete Vacuum Space disaster Rebreather Brewery Robot Master Boston Public Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Richard Feynman Teacher Kerosene lamp Glossary of wildland fire terms One Tree Hill (TV series) STS-51-L Sub-Zero Education in Japan Petroleum Haloalkane Fire Ice cream Raffles Institution White phosphorus incendiary Gasoline No Child Left Behind Act Material properties of diamond Thermocouple University of Virginia Apollo Command/Service Module Graduate school Transformers: Energon Socrates Miami-Dade County Public Schools Illegal drug trade Brown v.

high school nerves im a little scared about going to orientation and the first day of course im going to talk to ppl i dont know on the bus when i get on im just worried about not having anyone to walk into the school with any tips first don't fear orientation this is your time to learn about your school and figure out your schedule don't be afraid to ask questions no one is going to laugh at you for it chances are other kids have the same questions well if you will be talking to people on the bus ride in you can certainly walk into school with them you can even try to meet people at orientation then i would say join a club or sport team this will make your year so much more enjoyable and will greatly help you to meet new people and make friends everyone's first day is a bit awkward everyone is just as nervous as you are so never think you're going to be the only freshman walking in alone or lost in the hallways best of luck  Social rule Shaggy dog story Milton H.

teachers beating students i live in dubai i study in a cbse school i can't mention the school's name the teachers supervisor and also the principal physically punish students here it is very common and done by many of the teachers usually they slap us or whack us on the head but sometimes they take it too far once the media was involved after a teacher kicked a student in the stomach so the principal stated that this was the first he is hearing such a thing he lied he later told us in assembly that we force them to beat us if we complain about the teachers then the principal firstly wont do anything and the teacher develops a grudge against you the thing is they hit us even for small things like if we forget to wear our belt or tie we don't have detention here the teachers usually get rough when the student doesn't complete his homework i don't want to go to the police because i haven't taken any hard hit recently any ideas to stop this we can't hit back or else we will be expelled changing school won't help they are mostly like this if i approach the media then i'll be turning the entire school staff against me and might get suspended to that's the major disadvantage of complaining physical punishment is not leagal here this should not be allowed i as a teacher in the u s can see a place for corporal punishment but there are limits and strict protocols and never can a student be hit or kicked never let me suggest this your best weapon is documentation begin compiling lists of these offenses be sure to record dates places time of day and the names of those involved be sure to get witnesses after you have a thorough list get it notarized speak with your parents about this and ask their advice if you need to go further find an attorney present them with the list and ask their advice depending upon what they say you can then go to the police or something like a public prosecutor's office in with your notarized list this is who needs to help you two important things you need to know first this will cause a large public scene be ready for this second be sure to have all of the documentation in order and be sure that everyone is willing to speak up in public about these abuses i don't believe there will be a quiet way of dealing with this very best of luck  Columbine High School massacre Bristol Grammar School Domestic violence Plame affair Boston Public Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Hogwarts Royal Assent Treehouse of Horror V Theory of conduct Spanking Recurring South Park characters Calvin and Hobbes Martial art Corporal punishment Schapelle Corby Attorney at Law Kodocha Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters EastEnders Charter school Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Unlawful combatant Aikido Piccolo Junior Saga Plame affair timeline Condon Committee Great Teacher Onizuka GED Guantanamo Bay Volkert van der Graaf Jean Charles de Menezes Education in Romania Criminal justice system of Japan Capoeira Education in the United States Ben Johnson (athlete) The Inside Negima Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Punishment Capital punishment The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Little Britain Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Education in the People's Republic of China The Star Wars Holiday Special Hearsay Unidentified flying object Beavis and Butt-head Status of religious freedom in Sudan Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dilbert Roswell UFO incident Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Surveillance Education French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tennessee State Constitution Professional wrestling holds Aerial (dance move) Ty Cobb Knots Landing Education in Hong Kong Law & Order Avenue Q Alcoholics Anonymous Teachers (film) Camp Delta James Dobson Downing Street memo Code: Lyoko Social rule Sandy Koufax Age of consent Vivian Solon A Course In Miracles Sin City Jam (TV series) Probation officer Unreal Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Barrister Prime Minister of the United Kingdom One Tree Hill (TV series)

luck play a big part in examination luck or being hardworking or other factors i think that luck plays about a part in examinations factors that are beyond your control may include a harsh examiner or you may guess a few questions the biggest part is your confidence genuine confidence if you feel that you have studied hard enough and have done the best you can then you will feel confident if you know deep down that you haven't studied hard enough then any confidence you may pretend to have will be undermined by your subconscious fear my teachers always told me to look at an exam as an opportunity to show off how much you know this is a great way to look at it this way you are focusing on what you do know not what you don't which will give you a boost of genuine confidence and faith in your ability so i won't say good luck i'll say you can do it  Game show Hypnosis Theory of conduct Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Graduate school The nature of God in Western theology New York Knicks Bernard Williams Education in the United States Card Sharks Hyperinflation Prostate cancer College admissions $ale of the Century Social rule Sharon Tate Education in Portugal Boston Public Press Your Luck Galaxy Angel Luck Second language acquisition The Price Is Right Confidence trick Test (student assessment) I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Homeschooling Race and intelligence Education in Romania Tai Chi Chuan Aikido Hip hop rivalries Stomach cancer American and British English differences Supernatural Martial art Abduction Phenomenon Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland International cricket in 2005 A-level Good Morning, Vietnam Sociobiology Ouija Uzumaki Naruto Great Teacher Onizuka Religion The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Wheel of Fortune Milton H.

any advice to my son going into middle school just make sure he knows what is going on and what he is responsible for he must also be highly organized and keep track of assignments and deadlines in an agenda be sure that you check it every night elementary schools tend to hand hold kids but once in middle school they are expected to be more independent just remember in elementary school he had a few teachers and was in a class with maybe kids he will now have classes teachers a day who will each see about students a day if he is absent it is his responsibility to ask for the missed work no one will hand it to him or remind him like when he was in elementary school if he is late to class without an excusable reason this is cause for detention or a referral to the office they don't play around in middle school also school lunches will be a little different in elementary school he maybe had a choice of meals from the school menu he will now have the option of eating french fries pizza and other junk food everyday if he chooses most middle school cafeterias are like a mall food court and people wonder why we have an obesity epidemic in this country sorry to get on my soap box if your son is worried about being stuffed into a locker as is depicted on nearly every 'tween sitcom there is no way that is possible the lockers are so small you can barely hang up a winter coat don't buy a backpack with wheels either it will never fit have him practice using a combination lock at home so by the time school starts he will be an old pro he will also have to get used to changing for gym class which he did not have to do previously i think it is highly outdated but i don't make the rules finally enjoy him for the next years once he hits th grade if he is like many boys that age he will become possessed by hormones and do anything to get girls' attention he will probably be highly annoying to you but just know that it is a phase that will soon pass even though it sometimes seems like an eternity he will do fine and within the first weeks or so he will really enjoy the freedoms and opportunities that he has  French fries Poker jargon Education in Germany McDonald's Breakfast Primary education Hunter College High School Treehouse of Horror V Code: Lyoko Education in Romania Lynbrook High School Education in the People's Republic of China Taipei American School Obesity The Amazing Race Columbine High School massacre Azumanga Daioh Education in the United States Shaggy dog story FoxTrot Burger King Bristol Grammar School Springfield Elementary School Androgen insensitivity syndrome Generation Y Customs and etiquette of Japan Hamburger E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.

i am just entering geometry in school and i am a little afraid did you have fun in geometry i was in algebra a year earlier and i liked it a lot but people keep telling me that if i like one i won't like the other i usually get a's in math but this year in geometry i am skeptical in th grade i loved geometry but i think it had more to do with the teacher than with the information the basic difference is that with algebra there is usually one specific way to solve an equation you apply the formula and boom there you go with geometry there can be a number of different theorems that you can apply to solve a problem for kids that really like the one way structure of algebra that can throw them off you'll probably do fine especially if you understand the concepts behind lower math and algebra don't let the different way of doing things throw you geometry isn't really that hard  Algebraic geometry Geometry Arthur Cayley Algebra Mathematics education Clifford algebra Ordinary differential equation Curve Polynomial Axiom Galois theory Exponentiation Calculus Topology Linear algebra Group theory Elementary algebra Complex number Newton's identities Sheaf (mathematics) GED Combinatorics Henri Poincar__ Adjoint functors Josip Plemelj Fermat's last theorem Philosophy of mathematics Category theory Mathematics of general relativity __tale cohomology Projective geometry Ruler-and-compass construction Elliptic curve Pythagorean theorem Timeline of mathematics Education in Romania Algebra over a field Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Manifold Prime number Joseph Louis Lagrange Pi Where Mathematics Comes From Euclid's Elements Computer vision Motive (algebraic geometry) Gauge theory Non-standard analysis New math Algebraic variety Tensor William Rowan Hamilton Lie group Exact solutions in general relativity Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Physics Slope M__bius transformation Algebraic topology Richard Feynman Naive set theory Singularity theory Education in Taiwan History of mathematics Covariance and contravariance Probability Einstein-Cartan theory Deformation theory Symmetry Matroid Philosophical skepticism Exterior algebra Supersymmetry Hermann Weyl Scheme (mathematics) Leonhard Euler Boolean algebra Carl Friedrich Gauss Education in the United States Logic Matrix (mathematics) Abstract algebra Special relativity Differential geometry and topology Victoria University of Manchester Hamiltonian mechanics Alexander Grothendieck Hodge theory Associative algebra Diophantine equation Rendering (computer graphics) Alfred Tarski Economics Graph theory

first day of middle school im so nervous about lockers periods unified arts gym art i am scared to death what do i wear on the first day what happens if i cant even open my locker what if i dont have any classes with my friends help me anyone else feeling felt this way what was your first day of middle school like and did things go horrible or good did things get better help don't worry about the lockers at my middle school we bought them during social studies i have no idea why and then they let us go into the hall and practice opening them until we got the hang of it they're your best friend once you get the hang of them make sure you get one that's around all your classes though trust me a trained monkey could open a locker yeah it may take a couple tries to get it at first but by the third day you'll be slapping your head and going i was nervous about this think back to elementary school you did have periods only you didn't call them that you would start the day off with math and at do english then a you'd switch to science or something like that periods are just like that only you switch classes true your teachers are going to be a little more demanding but th grade is still pretty easy it's not until th grade or so that they get really demanding and by then you'll be ready most teachers will start off with a review of what you should already know so the first couple of weeks should be easy they expect you to get lost i don't know how big your school is but unless it's huge it's not as big as you think it is by the second week you should be able to navigate with ease gym is pretty much the same as it was is elementary except you have to change out and don't worry by the second week or so you'll be so confortable doing it that you'll be walking around in your undies to go get water and such i'm not kidding in the slightest pretty soon you won't be uncomfortable i don't know about art but if your school is requiring you to take it then even if you suck really bad like me you'll be okay as long as you do your work if you voluntarily signed up then they'll probably be harder on you sorry to tell you but you might end up in a class without any of your friends that's okay middle school is all about growing up and meeting new people is a part of that they're all just as nervous as you are so just be yourself and you'll have loads of friends as for what to wear on the first day wear normal school clothes unless your school specifically tells you to wear something different why they would i have no idea my first day well lemme see it was fun it's not much different from elementary first days except for the whole switching classes thing you meet new people you get better lunchroom food yay and you get to do new things other things unless you've gotten a school list beforehand the only thing you need to bring on the first day is a pen or pencil some paper and a folder you write down all the things you'll need for each class so you don't end up buying things you won't need if you can sit with new people at lunch even if you sit with old friends invite some new people over especially kids who moved from out of town no one wants to eat alone and it's a great way to meet people do your homework it's not like elementary school you teacher's not going to keep asking about missing assignments and make up tests you have to take it upon yourself to ask them about it don't be offended when your teachers don't know your name after a couple days some of them just suck at memorizing names it's nothing personal besides it's a great rapport builder when you have to coach the teacher to get your name every day whatever stereotypes you see in the movies forget them now don't waste your money on the dances if you have different bars in the lunchroom the pizza and chicken nugget bars are the best ones to visit this may be the first time your teachers allow you to eat during class take advantage of this don't worry have fun th grade is awesome join a club don't worry what people think don't annoy the upper grades it'll come back to bite you during high school do the extra credit do your homework all the best for a save and happy school year  Shaggy dog story Social rule Hunter College High School Kodocha Murdock-Portal Elementary School FoxTrot Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Bart chalkboard gags Education in Germany Education in Romania Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Milton H.

any advise for highschool i am very excited to go to hs but yet very nervous any tips i heard it can either be the best years or the worst years my advice make the most of it join groups that sound interesting get involved in volunteer projects and service hours sample new experiences and meet new people try hard to go on at least one school sponsored trip abroad try to get out of your comfort zone a bit hanging out with the same groups and the same clubs is ok but try new stuff also good or bad remember that it only lasts years it is a real part of your life but it is a terrible predictor of the rest of your life a lot of 'a' students go on to mediocre lives and a lot of nerds and 'losers' go on to great success a lot of the 'cool folk' are peaking now and will only go downhill and a lot of the unpopular kids will blossom later it is never too early to start thinking about the next part of your life if you plan on college what classes can you take now to help out start keeping an eye out for what majors might interest you wear sunscreen  Saved by the Bell Education in Romania Social rule The Ashlee Simpson Show Norway national football team W.

gcse hints my son will be sitting his gcses in june so this is a busy year for him has anyone out there got any tips for him in terms of revision and work as well as how to relax properly thanks as far as revision goes make sure that you know for sure that he is revising he should start revision around months before his exams starting at minutes a night it might seem like a long time before to start but i speak from experience when i say leaving it until the night before doesnt get you anywhere increase the time he spends revising as exams get closer bear in mind that he will need breaks as its shown that people lose focus and cannot work to their full ability after around an hour of constant revising encourage him to revise more frequently for those subjects he finds hardest but make sure he is still revising for the rest its also a good idea to draw up a revision timetable stating what subjects he should be revising for each day and for how long to help him relax try not to pressure him into revising all of the time he'll want time to go out and do things as well also dont constantly remind him of exams and how important they are he will know that already tell him that youll be proud of him whatever his results are as long as he does his best that means dont go telling him that you expect him to do come out with all a s good methods of revising include making flash cards questions on the front answers on the back of a card drawing up posters and sticking them around a room where he can see them all of the time sticking up motivation pictures quotes anything that will encourage him to do well going through notes written in class picking out key information writing this up and then continue condensing asking him questions from his work books  Test (student assessment) Extreme Programming SAT Past teachings of Prem Rawat Poker jargon GED Education in Germany Consensus decision-making Milton H.

selling sats papers issues i have alot of spare sats papers and i want to sell them to get rid of them i tried this on ebay a few weeks ago and some women said i was braking rules and threatened to report me to the qca qualifications and curriculam authority is there anything wrong with this thanks thery are just past papers they are sold on other websites and they have not had any bother if you are spelling spare copies of blank sats papers then i'm sure that you are fine doing so as i remember being able to buy them through whsmiths a few years ago haven't looked in recent years if they are still available to buy but i would guess so i'm assuming you are a teacher so you know that once a sat paper is released the questions won't get repeated so i can't see how you are breaking rules i guess the only thing could possibly be making a profit from someone elses work but to go as far this person did to complain to you seems pretty petty however if you are selling pupils filled in sats scripts that is a different matter lol anyway how much are you selling them for i'm interested myself p  SAT Education in England Theory of conduct Oakland Athletics MAME Have I Got News For You W H Smith 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines ROM image 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sin City Live 8 The Star Wars Holiday Special I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Publishing Internet fraud Philatelic investment Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Shaggy dog story Neopets Password RuneScape cheats CPU cache Fair use Make money fast Canadian Senate Houston Chronicle Philosophical skepticism GED The Age Wheel of Fortune The Apprentice 2 Negima Poker jargon Ken Jennings Weekly World News Book collecting Amiga Power Rupert Murdoch Voynich manuscript Socrates FoxTrot W.

how to battle high school on movies they show that high school is so much fun but i don't know if that's true in a couple of weeks school's gonna start and i've been really stressing about it i don't want to be the freaky genius girl again where everyone makes fun of i just wanna be normal and have friends to hang out with i just keep on thinking that high school is gonna be a drag my stepbrother makes high school so much fun he's the most popular guy there and everyone wants to be his friend i was somewhat popular in junior high but that's way different from high school any tips on how to conquer my fears of high school i don't even think i'm ready what is wrong with being the freaky genius girl being smart and being able to pick any career you want is a luxury that most people can only dream of if you are the freaky genius revel in it one of the things about high school is that you will loose some friends it just happens the friendships you develop will become more close and mean more than they did in elementary or junior high but they will be amongst a smaller circle of friends high schools have a larger population so you will have more people who are like you and like the same kinds of things you do this make high school more fun because you don't have to feel like you are trying to be like everyone else you get to be yourself and there are more people like you that you can hang out with if you do not try to be popular you will have a lot more fun trying to be popular only makes you stress about what others think about you if you are just yourself you will be popular among your group of friends also the more you can get involved in things like sports drama music honor society and other clubs the more fun it is that is an easy way to meet people who have common interests with you so don't worry about popularity high school is fun if you let it be fun be ready to make new friends and get involved in activities but above all be yourself have fun and don't worry  The Emancipation of Mimi One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule Jon Secada The Ashlee Simpson Show The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Friends Undergrads Azumanga Daioh AFI 100 Years series Kim Possible Saved by the Bell Avenue Q Green Day Tina Turner Can't Hardly Wait The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Milton H.

i have just enrolled my son with a holiday scheme teaching them maths and english days a week he is refusing point blank to go he is almost whats the best way of bringing him round he is adamant at the moment its only hours a day and of his friends are going i think he is scared but wont admit it i do kind of agree with the other posters that it is his holiday he is only a child and shouldn't have to worry about studying yet but i also understand that as his parent you want the best for him and for all we know you have had to put up with him being miserable at school all year or longer because at the moment he can't cope with the work in this case obviously you want to help him improve his skills so that he will be happier and more confident does he know exactly what the sceme involves i'm sure if it's a holiday scheme it will try to teach the kids in a fun way do they have leaflets or a website that you could show him as he may think that it will involve sitting down taking tests for hours each day of the scheme what will he be doing if he doesn't go try to make this option seem much worse than the scheme i e you want to clean out all the cupboards in the house so if he doesn't go he can be a big help to you if he thinks that he won't have fun even if he doesn't go he may be more willing to give it a go have a heart to heart with him choose a quiet time when you're both calm maybe when he's just got into bed and explain that you want to know why he doesn't want to go to the scheme if you stay calm and don't get cross with him he may be able to do the same and might open up with any worries which you can address be honest with him if he isn't doing so well at school he is likely to realise this at his age and you can talk to him about how much more confident he will feel starting a new school year a step ahead of his peers maybe arrange with the parents of the other kids a treat for the end of the scheme something that is just for those friends for going along and having a go ensure he knows that this treat is going to happen whether or not he goes to the scheme and it's up to him whether he wants to be able to have the treat along with his friends something like a trip to a theme park that you don't do often so he would know he would be really missing out if he didn't go i know when i started a new school year i always loved buying new stationery maybe go to a shop that sells nice stuff and explain that you are willing to buy him some supplies for the scheme even if he doesn't actually need any equipment he might be swayed by some of the funky pencil cases and notepads etc you can get these days obviously this is an extra expense but even cheap shops often have quite good ranges and if it gets him there it would be worth it maybe pair that with the idea of a new outfit for his first day as even if he has friends there he might be worried about what the kids who don't know him might think of him and a new tshirt and stationery set might boost his confidence enough to make him agree to go ultimately try not to get cross 'you are going ' is easily responded to 'no i'm not ' and once he's said this he might not want to 'lose' and backtrack so might always kick his heels in even if he's not that bothered anymore but keeping calm and trying out a couple of suggestions might help to bring him round in a way that makes him still feel he has a little control over the sittuation  Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Theory of conduct Social rule Poker jargon About a Boy Kodocha Great Teacher Onizuka Milton H.

can you be valedictorian if you transferred schools my friend who transferred to my school during freshman year after st semester is unsure whether he can be valedictorian he has the highest gpa in the class but he transferred from a different school after first semester will he be disqualified due to his late arrival on a side note if he isn't disqualified how late do you have to arrive at a school semesters years before you can't be given the valedictorian postion regardless of gpa from my experience selection of a valedictorian varies from school to school your district may have policies in place for valedictorian selection or it may be up to the guidance office to identify the student with the top gpa if i understand your question correctly your friend started attending the school during the freshman year that means he has been attending the school for years i can't imagine that being a problem i would think that a stipulation requiring valedictorians to go to school all four years at that school would be very rare indeed i could see it being a problem if someone transfered in during their senior year of course you need to ask the principal to be sure don't stress about it just find out from the source most teachers and principals would appreciate a student being interested in making good grades  Education in the United States Grade (education) Education in Germany Graduate school Lynbrook High School Dr. Michael M.

uniforms at schools are compulsory here in australia do you think it should be that way worldwide just wanting to see peoples views on it i live in the uk and it is also compulsary i think in a way yes this is because if people are allowed to wear what they want the poorer people will be shown up as having old clothes and not looking like the rest they will then be bullied for it and school life would just be a competition to see who can have the best clothes  Social aspects of clothing School uniform Caulfield Grammar School Uniform Clothing Scouting High school subcultures Poverty The Amazing Race Bully Basketball Fashion Conscription British Home Guard Public education Homeschooling Swimming pool Harrow School Education in Australia Marching band Figure skating Secondary education in Japan Hikikomori High school Culture of Korea Education in Japan Katarina Witt St. John Ambulance Tallit French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Doug Assam Kilt Irish dance Breaker Morant Culture of the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Seat belt legislation Jesuit College Preparatory School Gurkha Contingent Rave party Royal Rangers Eternal Word Television Network Voluntary Student Unionism Cross-dressing Education in Malaysia Gender role Military uniform Judo Ozzy Osbourne Education in the People's Republic of Poland Volleyball Ghana Wollongong, New South Wales Spanking Wealth Jujutsu Camouflage Involuntary commitment The Theory of the Leisure Class Sex Education Mercantilism Education in Romania Hogwarts Primary education Education in Scotland Fashion design Leisure Canadian Armed Forces South Australian National Football League Air Training Corps Fencing Sakura Kasugano Softball Publicly funded medicine Great Depression The Shield Eton College Drum and bugle corps (modern) Education in the United States Arrernte Retirement Bah__'__ Faith and Education 613 mitzvot Danish Folkeskole Education Doraemon Secondary education in the United States Truck Australian electoral system Victorian Certificate of Education Judge Brewery Nerd Pitaten South Australia Hasidic Judaism Dunman High School Externality Singapore Police Force

homeschoolage is it right to homeschool a child if you think you can be good enough to teach them all the material you need to know the trouble with that thinking is you will eventually get to a point where you won't be able to teach a child everything he needs to know think about it most teachers teach only one two classes since they have multiple sections of the same class they know a ton about the subject that they are teaching you get stuck teaching your child like subjects so if you want to make sure your child is getting a good education you have to make lesson plans also it's hard for a parent to be knowledged in all of the middle school and high school math science english history and foreign language information that his child needs to know this is true even if the parent is exceptionally bright so the quality of the child's education will suffer if you home school especially in the higher levels it's better just to let your child have multiple teachers you might be able to pull off doing home school on the elementary level particularly with the math and english areas but it will hurt your child in the end if you continue to home school him her but even in the elementary school level the kid might miss out on socialization skills if you home school him her there might be a few exceptions like perhaps if your child is getting beaten up in school or if the school district is failing miserably but generally you shoudln't home school a child  Education in the United States Education in South Korea Education in Taiwan Education Waldorf Education Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school Danish Folkeskole Education Education in Romania Education in Singapore SAT Education in Hong Kong Primary education Education in India GED Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Multilingual Grade (education) Secondary education in Japan Education in Austria Glen Ridge, New Jersey Gymnasium (Denmark) Boston Public Education in England IB Diploma Programme High school Montessori method College Intelligent design movement Magnet school Literacy Dyslexia Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Experiential education Gifted A.

when should a child learn about the declaration of independence in school which grade i was wondering because my soon to be rd grader had never heard of it and i thought she should have by now in school i guess i would have expected that by now they would have had a general overview of it and then of course in later grades delve more deeply into the subject would anyone mind asking their rd and th graders if they know what it is and how they found out i found out because i saw the movie national treasure and thought my daughter would enjoy it because although it's fictional it's still interesting once i explained what it was she was really interested in learning more about it and of course watching the movie i know that my son got at least an idea of what the doi was last year in nd grade i know because i had to make a business trip to dc in the fall near the beginning of the school year and all he wanted me to bring him was a copy of the constitution and a copy of the declaration he brought them for show and tell upon my return quite the hit with the under crowd  Graduate school Education in the United States Avenue Q Frank Herbert About a Boy One Tree Hill (TV series) Development of Darwin's theory GED E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.

what happened please answer from kindergarden to th grade i had been a social butterfly but then in th grade we moved to another school for half the school year i had made one friend there and then i came bach to were i lived before but to a different elementary school for the next half of th grade made friends to all of a sudden in middle school i am not social at all anymore and now in highschool i have trouble making friends cuz im so shy what happened to me i've always wondered this please answer same thing happened to me it could be just your natural temperament especially now that your hormones are fluctuating as you begin to go from a girl to a woman it can be a good thing because it makes you go deeper you find yourself now you slow down and don't make as many mistakes i knew another girl who kept her boldness in high school and beyond she ended up having no reservations and sleeping with guys getting diseases and has severe depression mood problems now in her s i am glad i got more introverted and shy in high school because it kept me more pure and not doing stupid things if i could look back though and guide you so you don't stay introverted like me you are going to have to honor that turning within in yourself try to look into yoga and meditation to take ti even further make it productive and don't let yourself get to withdrawn you are going to have to push your comfort level and make sure you socialize enough figure out what your passions are i e art music sports other fun things clubs volunteer etc and participate in them when you find more like minded people you will naturally start to come out and this will start to come out in the other areas of your life look at it as a gift most people have so many distractions with popularity they never find out who they are until they have a mid life crisis in s etc your body and mind are naturally slowing you down use it as a time to go within and find out what your passions are then talk action and the rest will happen naturally and don't worry too much you're young it's natural for some of us moving a lot as a young kid can be stressful it was important part of your life that is now influencing you still  Social rule Pitaten Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Jon Secada One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Milton H.

private school help well next tuesday will be my first day ever at private school i'm in the th grade and this will be my rd school i don't know if i'll adjust perfectly i have to go to church every friday i have to wear uniforms and if you want to be on a sports team you don't need to try out please if you've been at private school explain what it will be like for a public schooler like me private school will undoubtedly seem a little stricter and i do mean seem when i made the switch i was going from a montessori very loose private to a parochial very much like what you describe school montessori schools are very loose in that you don't have specific class times and you don't need to ask to use the bathrooms and you often call your teachers by their first names not so in private school and it sounds like you also have that parochial label too just expect a bit more rules the uniforms really aren't that bad i don't think they really solve the problem of kids wearing label and or gang clothes but i do think they serve a purpose to identify the school you attend everyone knew which school had the red navy and white in my neighborhood it's something to get used to as for the other it's not all that different you learn the same things you do the same things as with all new things it will take time to adjust and no one honestly adjusts perfectly i think that you might end up liking it to your surprise  Montessori method Homeschooling Education in the United States Education in Japan Theory of conduct Private school Culture of the United States Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Aesthetic Realism Social rule Harrow School Education in Germany Marching band French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Jesuit College Preparatory School 2000 Australian Grand Prix Miami-Dade County Public Schools Fecal incontinence Doug School choice Code: Lyoko College Lynbrook High School New York City Subway nomenclature Brown v.

why don't people take school seriously i was reading another question where someone was doing a debate against why kids shouldn't have homework some of the answers were so bizarre like one lady felt that her kids should automatically pass with c's because they go to class everyday her kids don't do their homework on time or at all so they're all failing another person said that only a bad teacher would need to assign homework how come you hear about kids in other countries who walk for miles and miles to go to school and actually have some respect for their teachers should we just make education optional in america and let people figure things out are kids just narcissistic and distracted with gadgets why do parents always blame teachers if i remember correctly from my high school it was the kids who were stubborn little assholes why has school become a hour holding cell for kids to just text and socialize they're just wasting time for those that actually want to learn so optional or mandatory absolutely mandatory if i have to suffer you've got to suffer too damnit besides even if they don't learn much at least they've learned the basics so that they can be somewhat productive in society seriously though a lot of kids in the us nowadays truly don't like school because they take everything they get for granted they either don't know or don't care that other kids across the world in third world countries find it a luxury to even have running water it's complete bs but that's just human nature we're selfish and we're self serving as far as the parents go parents always want to think that their children are little angels and can do no wrong of course that's just crap but as parents they feel they're obligated to help their children succeed and if that means that they've got to annoy the living daylights out of a teacher to get their children a passing grade then so be it plus the fact of the matter is that our educational expectations have taken a steep plummet and this is why asian countries like taiwan china japan etc are inching closer and closer to becoming true rivals of the us asian parents typically push their children much more than the average caucasian parents i should know since i'm taiwan asian living in cali ever heard of asian failing it's just a little joke but it's typically true amongst the asian population whereas most other races consider an f to be failing we usually consider a c to be failing but since the asian population is only large around the west and east coasts of the us and comprise only a small percentage of the entire population of this country it doesn't seem like the us is doing so hot actually most kids can do well in school but because of peer pressure and a yearning for popularity most kids forsake good grades for their public image studies have shown that the desire of a teenager to excel in school is surpassed by the desire to look cool in front of his her friends when isolated though kids typically do well and or better than what they usually do if they were in a class full of people in fact most kids aren't really stupid or dumb they're just afraid to really try hard lest they be made fun of for being a geek or a nerd which is total bs to me but that's just how it is  Education in the United States Social rule Education Pitaten Asperger syndrome Saved by the Bell Grade (education) Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Romania Shaggy dog story GED Boston Public Singlish Codename: Kids Next Door Philosophical skepticism Kindergarten Graduate school The Fairly OddParents Goodness and value theory Homeschooling Education in Taiwan The Adventures of Pete & Pete Japanese tea ceremony No Child Left Behind Act Economic inequality Columbine High School massacre The Marshall Mathers LP Theodicy Abortion debate Calvin and Hobbes Teachers (film) Martial art Friends Confucianism Nerd Gifted Milton H.

do you think that year round school is better than a traditional schedule my kids are getting ready to go back to school next week after having weeks off we were on a year round schedule until two years ago when we switched to traditional personally i liked year round because the kids seemed to stay in learning mode better when the max time they were off was six weeks after speaking to a few teachers they have implied that they spend the first weeks of school just reviewing everything from the last year and some of the children come back to school after weeks never having picked up a book do you think that year round school or traditional schedule is better for educating i agree year round is much better i'd like to see us go to a trimester system that would have month off in the summer and a week break between each trimester for the students and one for the teacher the teachers would remain for the first week off to accomplish all the stuff they don't have time to do during the regular day training grades in service etc this would give one extra week the middle trimester would be longer but time off for christmas and thanksgiving both of which would fall in that time frame would take care of that i also feel that teachers should be on a month contract and paid accordingly with two weeks of that summer break used for advanced skill training in their fields i don't feel a total of one month vacation is unreasonable many of our civil service employees receive that anyway military postal etc  Pregnancy Education in the People's Republic of China Grade (education) Education in Germany National Football League Academic term Education in Romania Education in the United States Education in Japan Tai Chi Chuan Education in Portugal Graduate school Education Teacher Social rule The Adventures of Pete & Pete International League GED Abortion debate Juris Doctor Education in Hong Kong The Contender (television series) Miami-Dade County Public Schools Kindergarten No Child Left Behind Act Suzuki method ITV Daylight saving time Wheel of Fortune Education in Australia Education in Taiwan Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Boston and Lowell Railroad Air Education and Training Command Playoff Conscription Walt Disney World College Program Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Monday Night Football Hogwarts Homeschooling Breastfeeding Education in Austria Lawyer Hikikomori The Catcher in the Rye Publicly funded medicine Billboard Hot 100 Minor league baseball Apprenticeship Thanksgiving Miscarriage Port Authority Trans-Hudson Education in Albania High school Literacy USS Yorktown (CV-10) Cleveland Browns Alex Ferguson Laura Schlessinger Alexander Technique Pro-choice USS Texas (BB-35) Johnson & Wales University Negima Primary education Classical education United States Postal Service Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Ben Johnson (athlete) __cole Polytechnique Heinkel He 112 Boarding school Master's degree Daikatana Leasehold estate Working time Kalamazoo College United States Army Christmas Miami Dolphins Lynbrook High School Charter school Neighbours Tripartite System North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics Waldorf Education Gregorian calendar Past teachings of Prem Rawat Pittsburgh Steelers USS Alamo Fasting Culture of the United States College Slow Train Coming Secondary education in France

what should i do about teachers who behave unprofessionally the school year is beginning i'm new to this school district and new to teaching we've had orientation workshops and meetings this past week i've been thrown into group meetings with some very unprofessional behaving teachers administration does not seem to care about their comments what should i do how should i behave thank you negative behavior at the expense of others what is the unprofessonal behavior are they being goofy instead of serious or are they talking negatively about others my answer would vary depending on the situation addendum if the comments were directed at those not in the group and were meant to disparage them i would stay out of it no matter what workplace you will ever be a part of some people will be like this we are all human and some are better at keeping things to themselves than others don't associate with the negative people as you may inadvertantly gain a reputation for being one of them believe me everyone knows who they are and what they're doing talk to your mentor privately about this and how to handle it if you do not have a mentor approach the principal privately mentioning no names up front and tell him this made you uncomfortable and ask for his advice on the situation odds are he is aware of it and perhaps chose to deal with it by bringing these people in to his office privately that would be the professional thing to do it may also be that he is not aware of the comments and attitudes and would welcome hearing about them from an unbiased party the best way to deal with this is to just let the behaviors go it's not professional and not condusive to a good working environment but you need to find people who you feel comfortable with in your job don't let these nasty folks bring you down or keep you from focusing on what's important doing the best job you can and providing quality education for your students you will come out of this with a good reputation if you politley distance yourself from the negative ones with a no thanks i don't feel comfortable discussing this when they try to draw you into the conversations you will not be rude thus getting their wrath on you but you are letting them know you will not be a party to their negativity or simply smile and ignore the conversation if you are in a situation where you cannot exit gracefully good luck to you  Social rule Ethics Theory of conduct Sexual orientation Traumatic incident reduction Dog training Alexander Technique Milton H.

my crazy cousin frm india is tryin to read shake speare in nith grade i don't get her she thinks harry potter is hard so she starts readin macbeth she is wierd her teacher told her to try to challenge herself she misunderstood and is tryin to read shakespeare she thinks readin off her level will make hera betta reada her english is ok not the greatest she thought macbeth was easy she did rread it times ova though but only got the basic story i am tryin to tell her that shakespeare is not for her unless there is a teacha there explainin it to her its a basic waste of her time she is very stubborn though even though she is from india and she went to the nd best school in the entire state there she doesn't seem all dat bright her math skills are starange she knows trigno etry but not algebra one my other cousin from india knew algebra one from th grade this school she went required a good score she is very stubborn and loves to argue she thinks damn harry potter is tough and shakespeare is easy she didn't even know macbeth w play i have studied in india for ten years and i know about how they train kids in most of the schools they give a huge preference to english and most schools teach algebra from sixth grade when i came to us i never had a problem with english because of the good educational foundation i got in india in ur cousins case it seens like she is one of those students who might have studied in a good school but might not have put much effort into studying math thats probably why she has touble with math not everyone can get the ability to understand math easily it may require some time and as for reading shakesphere in ninth grade i dont think there is anything wrong with reading it she might not understand it completely but understanding the basics of the story is good enough at her age and she should be encouraged to read more and dont discourage her inclination to read more just because she didnt understand harry potter books even though hp books are written in quite simple language rowling uses a lot of her own vocabulary and also if she was starting to read the story frm the first edition it takes a while to get a grasp of the story for a some people its mostly becasues the first few chapters of the books were a little too descriptive i am a big fan of hp and i love rowlings way of writing but i know some people needs a while to get a grasp of it in my opinion you should make her watch one of those hp movies first and then let her read the book it will help out a lot  Education in Romania Mathematics Hogwarts subjects Education in the United States A-level Graduate school Extreme Programming Grade (education) Literacy Education SAT Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Theory of conduct Kodocha Education in the People's Republic of China Milton H.

how do i act tougher i am going into high school in just a few weeks and i would like to be tougher and not like middle school this school is strict and everything and i will pay attention to my school work and stuff but i want people to know that they should mess with me there are two answers to this question depending upon your background first if you have been bullied and a victim then you definitely need to act tougher otherwise you're in for a long four years my suggestion to you would be to join a martial arts program now this is not so you can beat people up etc but it does give you the self confidence that you need believe it or not the knowledge that you can take care of yourself is often all you need people will sense that and pretty much leave you alone but be sure you go into it for the right reasons not to become a bully yourself if you just wish to be more grown up so people don't treat you like a little kid and they are just nicer there is already a lot of good advice up here be kind and considerate to others offer to help them when they need it pay attention and be respectful to your teachers even if you don't like them in other words set a good example for others  Boston Public Theory of conduct Education in the United States Martial art Social rule Philosophical skepticism Copyleft Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Plame affair Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Graduate school Pitaten Contract Secondary education in the United States No Child Left Behind Act Logic The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Bully Culture of Lithuania Expert system Summa Theologiae Poker jargon Merit Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Code: Lyoko Current teachings of Prem Rawat Vegeta Laura Schlessinger Hikikomori Consensual crime Natural deduction Education Time Out of Mind Education in Romania The Ashlee Simpson Show Aikido Alignment (role-playing games) Presuppositional apologetics Past teachings of Prem Rawat Education in Germany Saved by the Bell Epistemology Rich Mullins Emperor Yuan of Han 2004 Democratic National Convention Philosophy of language Profession American Psycho Emperor Xuan of Han Rape GED Martial Quizbowl Sampling (music) Socrates Microeconomics Theodicy Supply and demand Jiddu Krishnamurti Calvin and Hobbes Swami Vivekananda Section 28 Coercion Homeschooling Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chinese martial arts Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Great Teacher Onizuka Education in the People's Republic of China 2003 Invasion of Iraq Secondary education in Japan Objectivist philosophy Goodness and value theory Royal Assent The Fairly OddParents Transactional analysis Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Offer and acceptance The nature of God in Western theology Extreme Programming Reiki The Adventures of Pete & Pete Abortion in the United States Little Britain Irish syntax Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Governor-General of Australia Newbie Creationism Danish Folkeskole Education Academia Cultural relativism School violence Sharia Abortion debate God Emperor of Dune Independent school (UK)

me and my education im going to high school this year and i need help studying and getting good grades i used to sometimes cheat in middle school and i knew it was bad because i didn't learn anything now its hurting me because i dont know how to study and get the information in my brain can someone help me i need help on how to study so i dont have to cheat in high school for example when i study for science and history i just read a little and get bored i try to put the info in my head and then the next day i take the test i forget everything that makes me want to cheat im good at math can someone help me on how to get the info into my head i dont know why i dont remember it i try to i want to be smart and get good grades so i get into a good college i think its that i dont put my head into it its like im not interested but i want to be and want to get good grades please help me thanks first of all the scenerio you describe could be mine no one taught me to study and i really didn't learn until i went to college when you get an assignment like reading a novel or writing a paper try to figure out how many pages you need to read each day to finish about a week ahead of when it's due while you read keep a log where you will write something down every couple of pages don't forget page numbers so you can find it if you need to if it's your book you should also keep a log but then you can highlight the important statement you can do this with science and history classes to also sometimes reading a loud to your self can help you remember things some people are audio learners so we learn by hearing it better than reading silently in math you need to keep a math notebook rewrite instructions on how to do particular problems so you don't have to search through the text book then you can study for your test from that instead of plodding through all the stuff in the book you could aslo get a study partner just to run through things with i would guess that you have test anxiety and so you go blank on tests i found that if i read all the questions in order skip the ones that you can't do but get the ones done that you are sure of done then go back if you are filling in the dots on an answer sheet just be careful to get your answers in the right place also get a good nights rest before the test you could also tell your teachers and guidance counselor that you have test anxiety and maybe they will have some options for you it's nice to see a student who is interested in doing better take deep breaths and try to relax before you focus on a problem good luck to you http www urbanext uiuc edu succeed test html this is a link on test anxiety  GED Education in Romania SAT Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Graduate school Turing machine Grade (education) No Child Left Behind Act Second language acquisition Theory of conduct Test (student assessment) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Mathematics Cascading Style Sheets Current teachings of Prem Rawat Social rule Education in the People's Republic of China American and British English differences Meditation Pitaten Education in Taiwan Stuttering EastEnders Gifted Dyslexia Milton H.

i need to get motivated for school please help how can i motivate myself to do well in school this year i would really like to get straight a's because i'm entering high school and these are the years it really counts i need to get good grades along with a number of other things in order to get a scholarship and i need a scholarship to get into all of my top choices as colleges so what i'm really asking here is how can i get motivated to work hard i'm already super busy outside of school and i go to a really hard private school that gives us sooo much work that's it's hard to keep up in all of my subjects let alone excell in them i'm also taking a lot of subjects including two languages french and latin i usually get pretty average grades a's and b's but now i really need to crack down since i'm entering high school college is very pressuring i just need some advice how can i motivate myself to do better i usually procrastinate a lot that's a huge problem for me and i am very forgetful please help thanks in advance for any answers i'm not cutting back on after school activities i take soccer and love it so i'm not dropping that and i also take tennis and crew love them don't have much going on in the winter bu ti do horseback riding too and babysitting to get some money anyway i'm not cutting back on them i get home from sports at about so i don't think that's a huge problem because i have the rest of the night to do homework and stuff and i normally bust my butt over the weekend so i don't have a lot of stuff to do during the week there's nothing wrong with a's and b's especially since it sounds like you have a lot of extracurricular activities actually you sound pretty motivated already be sure to do your homework every night and to not be afraid to ask questions in class since you're forgetful try getting a planner to carry with you and write down every assignment and due date if you can get in the habit of looking at it then hopefully you won't forget as much you can also get some post its in college i've been like addicted to them use them to make lists of things you need to do for the day and to remind yourself to work on your paper or w e find a certain place to always do your work a quiet place not near a tv or computer put away your cell phone and put your away message up try to limit all of these distractions and it can help you stop procrastinating also have you ever had a horrible time where you left a big project til the end and had to work on it all night making mistakes like that help motivate me to not procrastinate i actually still struggle with it but i have learned a lot allow yourself to take study breaks have your parents nag you put up a post it on your refrigerator or in your room somewhere where you'll see it alot and have it say something to remind you about your scholarship or put up a brochure of one of your favorite colleges it will remind you of where you're trying to go ps don't drive yourself crazy with tons of hard classes you want to be able to enjoy your life too and two languages probably isnt necessary  Procrastination GED Education in Romania Education in the United States Saved by the Bell Education in the People's Republic of China Time Out of Mind Hunter College High School Shaggy dog story Education in Germany Grade (education) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Humphrey Bogart Boston Public Billboard Hot 100 Singlish Pitaten 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Ashlee Simpson Show Social rule Jennifer Lopez The Emancipation of Mimi Equine conformation Game show W.

i need nice school supplies that will last for almost the whole school year i want cheap schools supplies that will last almost the whole school year think cheap im going to th grade ok your first problem is that good stuff usually isn't cheap if you get wal mart cheap you will probably not last through the first quarter much less the rest of the year my suggestion is to spend a little more money in the beginning and go to staples they have heavy duty notebooks that if you take care of them will last you the entire year the fun thing is that these are view binders so you can put your favorite artwork inside to personalize them stuff you can get on the cheap at wal mart pens pencils notebook paper scissors glue etc the other way to save money is not to fall for the crap that places try and sell you you don't need keepers or other fancy products  Wal-Mart Floppy disk Gross domestic product Microeconomics Theory of conduct Shit Autograph Fountain pen Laptop Economy of Russia Pencil Craps Inflation Keynesian economics Surplus value Rich Mullins Bank The Star Wars Holiday Special Deflation (economics) Say's law Economy of India Community emergency response team Sears Holdings Corporation Tax Graduate school Economics Diagon Alley Tourism Cruising (maritime) Red Hot Chili Peppers Arthur Laffer Care Bears Nuclear power Economy of Africa Humphrey Bogart Neopets Spidey Super Stories Upholstery Guitar Externality British small press comics Capital accumulation Gramophone record Traditional animation Money supply Tariff Outsourcing Professional wrestling slang Blood on the Tracks Celeron Pinball W.

at which grade is show and tell obsolete i am a school teacher and i am having trouble justifying wasting a half hour to an hour each week on show and tell i would like to hear comments on the pros and cons of show and tell i teach first grade at an elite private school i do understand that they need time to publicly speak and listen and learn to respect others however they do have other venues for this in class i find that too often the kids bring a toy and just want to show it and not talk i didn't have show and tell in first grade we had journals instead where we could write about how we were feeling and what we were doing at home i think journals are developmentally appropriate because it helps st graders with emerging writing skills you could allow them to share their journals in small groups or pick a few kids every week to talk about them so they all get a turn  Education in the United States Rush Limbaugh Experiential education Graduate school Hunter College High School Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Edward R.

high school diploma ok to start off i didn't graduate high school but i was able to walk on the stage and recieve only a certificate i had a gpa i took classes throughout my whole years of high school because i went to an art school i had extra classes that were my majors i passed all of my profiency but not my math math is my weakest subject i have tooked it over times but i don't want to use as an excuse i had a difficult time in my life and i had no motive my mother had to go through operation and my dad was a complete let down one day my dad cross the line and told me i'm not good at anything and i should just die so i ran away moved in with my sis little did i know her fiance was a complete pervert i hate to say it coz it hurts but he molested me from there i ran away again at the moment i am just working i was able to find a gd job w o diploma coz of my charisma so its been years and i really want to go to college is it too late to take the proficiency iam not sure if i get what you are asking because i never went to hs but i can recommend getting a ged the ged itself is bs and most retarded hamsters could pass it but you need one to get into a junior college or a regular college without a hs diploma and don't listen to people that say it can't be done it's done every day i personally got into a small second tier year school with just my ged i wrote a good essay did a good interview and jumped through some hoops but even if that doesn't work out for you you can trudge through a community juco do two years there and transfer up to a bachelors granting school to finish your undergrad most small lib arts school struggle with enrollment if you are bit older you instantly win some points they worry about young people they won't graduate and they know statistically older people will last the years if they make it through their first i'd only do all this if you are interested in academics and enjoy learning college can be a big waste of time if you aren't motivated by your own ability to discover if you aren't internally academically motivated might be another way to put it a college degree opens doors but they are meager doors it's nothing a highly motivated person can't open for themselves if they are dynamic and skilled no one learns any practical skills as an undergrad except science students i left a decent job to go to school and the truth is i know that i won't get that much better of a job when i get out in my old job i had no experience i worked my way up to the point where three different departments wanted me anybody can do that anybody you just have to want it this country and its employers are so used to lame people that if you show the least bit of initiative you immediately distinguish yourself if you want it if you have good common sense and if you give it everything you have you can still make it in this country for people like that a college degree is totally optional  Education in the United States Community college College admissions Graduate school Education in Portugal Education in Australia Education in Germany High school Medical school College Physician Social rule Master's degree IB Diploma Programme Homeschooling Intelligence quotient Teacher Grade (education) Associate's degree Education in Hong Kong Education in the People's Republic of China City and Guilds of London Institute No Child Left Behind Act Education in Singapore Education in Taiwan Law school Nurse Academic degree Education in Romania Chinese University of Hong Kong Lawyer Education in the Republic of Ireland Kwantlen University College Athabasca University Shaggy dog story Paralegal Tai Chi Chuan Education in France Smith College University of Central Florida Multilingual One Tree Hill (TV series) Affirmative action Australian Qualifications Framework Professor Seneca College Memorial University of Newfoundland Theory of conduct Quizbowl Education in Japan Columbia University University of Michigan Second language acquisition Johns Hopkins University University of Houston Academia Cornell University Electrical engineering Unemployment General practitioner Trinity College, Dublin Middle Tennessee State University UCAS Apprenticeship University of Alabama New York Giants Education in Malaysia Emerson College A-level The Citadel (Military College) Honey and Clover University of Idaho Marilyn Monroe Virginia Military Institute Education in Finland Merrimack College Anglo-Chinese School Florida Institute of Technology Graduation Test (student assessment) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Georgetown University Secondary education in the United States Hunter College High School Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Kodocha University of Notre Dame Numerus clausus Tianjin University Open University

how can i avoid spelling mistake while writing for example complete complite if you are using the pc then you have an advantage of using the built in dictionary for checking your spellings or using the online dictionary but if are looking out to avoid spelling mistakes why writing manually then you need to split the words and pronounce them mentally so that you can write it correctly for example let us take the word triskaidekaphobia so it would be split as tris kai deka pho bia now pronounce it as you write the pronunciation would be something like tris ki de ka fo bea it would be better if you understand the meaning of the words you are writing read books magazines poems plays stories and more the more language you're exposed to the more new words you'll learn make it a habit to find a new word every day look in the dictionary sign up for a word a day see dictionary com or m w com or make swapping new words a game with a workmate or fellow student speak to people you'll be exposed to an amazing range of cultural influences and occupations all of which will introduce you to new words write down words you don't know keep a pad in your briefcase or purse just for that purpose look up the words in a dictionary so you'll understand what they mean how they're spelled and their various usages this will also help you remember the words make flashcards of the words and go through them regularly i used this for tofel create or play word games scrabble and mad libs for example are great ways to reinforce new vocabulary words  English language Greek language Chinese language Italian language Cantonese (linguistics) Korean language Finnish language Kanji R__maji Chinese character Pinyin Australian English Dutch language Hanja Esperanto as an international language American and British English differences German language Spanish language Non-native pronunciations of English Hindi Hungarian language Hangul Danish language Scottish Gaelic language Hong Kong English Romanian language Singlish Arabic language Second language acquisition Spelling reform Arabic alphabet French language Ukrainian language African American Vernacular English Simplified Chinese character Vietnamese language Speech synthesis Welsh language Hiberno-English Polish language Russian language Old English language Portuguese language Indonesian language Canadian English Esperanto Urdu Classical Chinese J__rriais Scrabble (game show) Chinglish American Sign Language Albanian language Literature Slovak language Phoneme D'ni Occitan language Vowel Egyptian hieroglyph Wolof language Medical prescription Standard Mandarin Spell checker American English Norwegian language Diacritic Afrikaans International Phonetic Alphabet Shibboleth Persian language Okay Standard Cantonese Hebrew language Oxford English Dictionary Blackjack Fuck English spelling Eh Anglo-Norman language English as an additional language Irish language Linguistics Reading education Chinese written language Euphemism Taiwanese (linguistics) Liaison Acronym and initialism Serbo-Croatian language Middle English

do you think all school will soon be year round and is this really fair to the kids how is this going to affect kids in large family from having a vacation together there is a misconception regarding the elimination of the summer vacation from school most people who favor eliminating summer vacation do not want to extend the school year as much as they want to reduce the amount of time away from the classroom to have three whole months away from a mind stimulating environment is entirely too long and is an archaic paradigm which dates back to an agricultural economy the standard school year is days long even if it were to be extended it would most likely be no more than days long i personally favor the concept of year round schooling i think it would take less pressure off of teachers and students would retain more information especially those participating in an elementary program year long schooling is in no way to designed to prevent families from vacationing or in any way undermind the importance of family  Daylight saving time Homeschooling Education in the United States Primary education Education in Taiwan Education in Japan Montessori method No Child Left Behind Act Education in the People's Republic of China Single Transferable Vote Teacher Free trade Kindergarten Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Education in France Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus School bus Education in Romania Unemployment Education reform Famine Policy Debate Nutrition Recess (TV series) Charter school The Adventures of Pete & Pete Cornell University Clinical depression Caulfield Grammar School Kitzmiller v.

what should i do if my child has a teacher that i don't like i've worked in the school system in the past and am familiar with a teacher who i feel is mean to her students i witnessed her smack her own son in the mouth for peeing his pants in first grade and this teacher asked me to remove a child's books which were peed on because she didn't want to touch them she has access to gloves as much as i do but she was pregnant and used that to hide her ignorance to disease processes i didn't request another teacher at the end of school last year because i have done this in the past with another child and have been told that requests cannot be granted and i figured with teachers in this grade the chances are only that she will be my child's teacher well guess what so other parents and teachers what should i do should i wait and give it a chance i'm not sure anything can be changed at this point school starts aug th can someone be horrible personally but still be a good teacher i've seen it time and time again people i thought would be dismal failures in the classroom because of my reaction to their personalities and then the students loved them since your school doesn't take requests you probably can't do much anyway i would be vigilant but don't let on to your child how you feel about the teacher act as if you don't know anything about her you don't want to either prejudice your child against her which could hurt your child or to make your child uncomfortable about telling you about anything that goes on in the classroom i agree with you that the fact that she hit her own son was very disturbing but i think you may be overreacting on the other issue if the teacher didn't have children of her own yet most people aren't very comfortable with bodily secretions obviously if reports surface of real potential violence or even verbal abuse against children you need to say something immediately  Kodocha Theory of conduct Social rule One Tree Hill (TV series) No Child Left Behind Act Boston Public EastEnders Narcissism Humphrey Bogart Education in the United States Education Philosophical skepticism Motion picture rating system Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Abortion debate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Grade (education) Milton H.

for americans what are the sat's and how do they work i'm in ireland and here we have the leaving cert we have to do a minimum of subjects although most do and the maximum no of points is points per subject out of your best results i've been told that on an international level that we have one of the hardest final exam in the world as our courses are extremely detailed and some exams can take upto hours if you could compare the for me it would be greatly appricated thank you what i have no idea what tidal m is talking about that's nothing like the sats you take in america the sat is a standardized test usually used as an entrance exam for colleges universities it's not really hard as there is no pass fail point you just get a score just putting your name down will get you a minimum score of a couple hundred points there is a perfect score though the sat has two parts we refer to the first one as sat i and the second as the sat ii most scores you see on yahoo answers refer to just the combined sat scores the sat i has sections now verbal called critical reading now math and writing each has a highest score of leaving you with a best possible score of not too long ago they didn't have a writing section so you'll hear some scores out of a possible it can get confusing because someone on here might say they got a score of that's a very good score on the old scale but it's horrid on the scale the sat ii is more subject based you can as many sat ii tests as you like you just pick which test you want to take it's based on subjects like literature or biology instead of a generic term like critical reading the sat is that the sat is completely optional there's a competing test called the act that most colleges will accept when you apply for admission if you don't intend on going to a regular year university you don't need to take either one  Advanced Placement Program Grade (education) High school GED Test (student assessment) College admissions Graduate school Education in the United States National Certificate of Educational Achievement Junior Certificate Juris Doctor Education in Romania The Princeton Review Graduate Record Examination Education in Hong Kong Education in Singapore IB Diploma Programme Education in Germany Education in Portugal American and British English differences Extreme Programming Education in the People's Republic of China Leaving Certificate Medical College Admission Test Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination Education in Australia Baccalaur__at Scientology beliefs and practices Physician Standardized testing Stuyvesant High School Quizbowl Law school Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME College Board Numerus clausus Victorian Certificate of Education Prostate cancer Higher School Certificate Education in France Explosive material NUS High School of Mathematics and Science Appeal General Certificate of Secondary Education Trinity College, Dublin Beatmania IIDX Secondary education in France ELO rating system Education in England Law School Admissions Test English grammar Contract bridge Lynbrook High School UCAS Baseball Tripartite System Item response theory Poker jargon Education in Sweden Doomsday argument The Apprentice 2 Jeopardy!

is public school better than private school well i know that private school is safer and teach about god but the public school that i'm going to doesnt have a school nurse or a school consuler spelled that wrong i'm sure lol and my cousin goes to a public school and she was telling me about how they have a lot more classes to take than i do like they have shop and home ec etc and at my school u have to take spanish but at her school u have an option to either learn spanish french or german or swedish and i know that public school doesnt let the teachers teach about god but isnt that why we go to church so do u think that you guys could possibly help me out some public schools are better funded than others or have more dedicated teachers and admin along with supportive parents private schools aren't necessarily safer the only ones that teach about god or the religious ones typically catholic altho there are all kinds of christian ones i went to private christian schools from pre school to second grad and then a non religious private school for rd to th i went public from there on out i had plenty of opportunities to learn about god in sunday school at church i didn't have to do it during regular school if you don't have a school nurse it's not that big a deal i never thought they were that useful anything major and you'd have to go to a hospital anyways anything less and a coach or regular teacher could stick a bandaid on you just as well as a nurse could not having a school counselor could suck however i've never had a school counselor who knew what they were doing even in college all it did was force me to go out and figure out how to do stuff on my own i learned about colleges by asking friends and family now you've got the internet so it's a lot easier i learned how to apply to colleges by reading the instructions carefully my high school only had spanish and french at first no biggie later on it added a whole bunch of different languages like chinese japanese korean tagolog german etc but only because a local resident volunteered to be a teacher i didn't think it was a big deal that i couldn't start in those new languages spanish is going to be the most useful in the us anyways maybe chinese  Education in the United States Separation of church and state Homeschooling College Education in Japan Clergy Education in Romania Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Malaysia Humphrey Bogart Christian right Reiki Culture of the United States Graduate school Multilingual Family name Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Simplified Chinese character Teach the Controversy Religious education Education in Hong Kong Languages of Hong Kong SAT Private school French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Intelligent design movement Non-native pronunciations of English Korean language Catechism Tai Chi Chuan Milton H.

whats your secret to for anyone who did well in their sat's a levels or leaving cert can you please tell me the secret to your exam sucess i made a on my sat's with only one attempt fortunately i'm blessed with excellent test taking skills so that was a large portion of it my advice for sat's would be this which area is your strong point mine was math so i didn't worry so much about the math part sure i reviewed and studied the main points and some formulas but the math was easy to me i had to work at the vocabulary part get a study guide and pore over the questions frequently don't cram to much into one time period or it will all be a jumble but those study guides contain a lot of the vocabulary words you will come across in the test pay attention the the root part of the word or to the prefix and suffixes as they will often offer a hint to the answer thankfully the test is multiple choice in the math part it's usually pretty easy to rule out one or two answers right away just because they don't make any sense really just buy a study guide and don't wait until the week before the test to start giving it serious effort just half an hour an evening over the course of a month will do wonders for you and for all tests make sure you have plenty of rest eat a good healthy breakfast take your time so that you don't make careless mistakes if you start to feel overwhelmed put down your pencil close your eyes and massage your temples to relax for a couple minutes if you have any time left over at the end of a section go back and check your answers or go back to the ones that gave you particular trouble and give them another go the good thing about the sat's is that you can take them again and again and it's always your highest score that counts good luck  SAT Social rule Education in Romania Mathematics Time Out of Mind 2000 Australian Grand Prix Junior Certificate The Princeton Review Singlish Quizbowl Prostate cancer Breastfeeding Craps English grammar Piccolo Junior Saga American and British English differences Pitaten Stomach cancer Second language acquisition Swami Vivekananda Ravi Shastri Blood on the Tracks Have I Got News For You Theory of conduct Crossword Jumpstart 3rd Grade Dyslexia Game show Richard Feynman Hiberno-English Jeopardy!

which is better public high school or private high school just want to know lol it really depends on you check out some websites of private schools they are usually very college focused and foster a sense of community between students also since they have a huge income from their students they arn't financially starved like some highschools so they will probably have newer technology and smaller class sizes public high schools tend to be more relaxed with more focus on each class then each individual student you will have to do the work yourself because nobody is going to force you to do it it really comes down to a personal choice and also if you are willing to spend a few thousand dollars a year to go to school if the public schools in your area are really sketchy and gross consider a private but if they appear to be lively and have a sense of community there might not be the need to spend all that money  Gross domestic product Education in the United States Progressive tax Economy of the United States Graduate school Secondary education in France Homeschooling High school College Education in Germany Education in Australia Education in Romania Public education No Child Left Behind Act Independent school (UK) GED Inflation School choice Capitalism Education in Hong Kong Education in Portugal Secondary education Education in Taiwan Economic inequality Flat tax Tax Microeconomics Education in Japan Scholarship Babson College Students' union Community college Aikido College and university rankings Student Publicly funded medicine Capital accumulation Student loan French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Education in France Rice University Franklin W.

how to survive high school i'm a year old going to be sophmore kinda quiet all my life people are like you never talk but i only talk to my friends dont' have good fortune with girls for me personally how can i survive academically i am very good yet lazy to all those who post to this i thank you alot we all had trouble adjusting to high school life you are trapped in a public system where everyone is required to be up to a certain age so you get stuck with a bunch of different types of people you might have never known this can be a nightmare and a blessing high school is about discovering who you are what your interests and beliefs are how you are different from your parents and where you alike this is a confusing time for parents and teens i graduated years ago and i'm now in college the best advice i can give is to find out the things you love and the things that interest you and pursue them as much as you can take classes that interest you and take up a hobby my freshman year i hated reading all the books the teachers made us read but by my senior year i met a girl that got me into books and now i'm studying to be a librarian also if you want to go to college start doing good in your classes you are already smart so just get the work done and don't be afraid to ask for help this will help you in the future girls like boys that have their own interests and they like boys who are not afraid to be themselves i was also the shy type i didn't date until i was a senior in college you will meet alot of girls trust me  One Tree Hill (TV series) W.I.T.C.H.
