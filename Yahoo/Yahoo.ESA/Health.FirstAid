what is a good home remedy for a severe sunburn i have been recomended several options like a deluted vinagar bath hand lotion butter and have even broken an aloe leaf and applied the gel but is there anything else what do you say i know butter is out of the question anything other than aloe vera gel is actually bad for your burn and can leave you open for infection food products yogurt butter vinegar lotions of any kind oils and ointments actually form a barrier between the open air and your burn which traps heat and germs within your burn making it worse and creating a breeding ground for infection aloe vera gel is the best thing for a first degree sunburn the bottled store bought stuff is best put it in the fridge so it will be soothing when you apply it it allows your burn to breathe and helps heal it by keeping the skin from drying out if you have blisters on your burn this is considered a nd degree burn and you need to seek medical attention to get a prescription for silvadene it's a special zinc oxide based cream that allows your burn to breathe while healing it you can only get it by prescription from your dr hope this helps  Aloe Sunburn Psoriasis Zinc Eczema Halitosis Dairy Common cold Wart Fecal incontinence Food preservation Butter Wound healing phases Medical prescription Herpes simplex virus Massage Scar Manicure Swimming Wound Milk Acne Explosive material Personal lubricant Ice cream Garlic Capsaicin Gelatin Scabies Dandruff Tocopherol Curry Tofu Shaving Peanut butter Plastic Carbon dioxide Tattoo Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sunlight Osteoarthritis Sulfuric acid Medicine First aid kit Otitis externa Peanut Casting Copper extraction Gastroesophageal reflux disease Stomach cancer Livestock Homeopathy Fire fighting Smoke-screen Hyperbaric oxygen therapy Pneumonia Motor oil Nitroglycerin Breakfast Pizza Physical therapy Mayonnaise Tea Candidiasis Bacteria Sauna Hemp Chocolate Ultraviolet Potato Microeconomics Silver First aid Al-Razi Urticaria Urinary incontinence Hemorrhoid Fancy rat Hydrogen peroxide Althaea (genus) Bagel Polyethylene terephthalate Cheese Aluminium Barbecue Patent medicine Illegal drug trade Oral sex Decompression sickness Food and Drug Administration

black outs sometimes when i stand up really fast or move at fast speeds i get really dizzy or i black out for a few seconds what causes this what most likely happened was when you stood up your body didn't compensate quick enough to keep blood flow going to your brain this is normal and even common in some people who take some certain medications or are dehydrated you can prevent this from happening in the future by slowing your stance even ever so slight to allow your body to compensate the human body such a fine tuned instrument in terms i hope you'll understand will constrict some vessels and slightly raise the heart rate to keep the blood going to where it's needed in fact the job of the cardiovascular system is to keep the heart and brain perfused with blood oxygen  Blood pressure Circulatory system Traumatic brain injury Cardiac stress test Intracranial pressure Dehydration Atherosclerosis Shock Heart Diabetes mellitus Blood vessel Drowning Myocardial infarction Cardiac arrhythmia Functional magnetic resonance imaging Hypoglycemia Angina First aid Medicine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cephalic disorder Aortic valve stenosis Pulmonary alveolus Eye Muscle Emergency Medical Services Triage Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tourniquet Carburetor Decompression sickness Tachycardia Hyperventilation Folic acid Equine conformation Balance disorder Diabetic neuropathy Caffeine Turner syndrome Pain Human physiology Air embolism Chronic fatigue syndrome Pneumonia Atheroma Ischemia Insulin Coronary heart disease Hypertension Blood Tobacco smoking Wound healing phases 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Hyperthermia Dieting Multiple sclerosis Cryonics Suicide methods Mitral regurgitation Defibrillation Atrial septal defect Cardiac arrest Propranolol Cardiac cycle Tyrannosaurus rex Electrophysiology Carbon dioxide Aphasia Vitamin C Fast bowling Panic attack Ventricular fibrillation Water Asthma Beta blocker Cancer Glycogen storage disease type I Spatial disorientation Erythropoietin Tai Chi Chuan Weight training Human anatomy Cholesterol Puberty Intravenous therapy Cardiology Tocopherol Human brain Bleeding Jet engine Lung Childbirth Kidney Apoplexy Volleyball Subdural hematoma Computer virus Prostate cancer

how can i treat nose bleeds what are some ways to stop and keep your nose from bleeding since i live in vegas where the climate is pretty dry all the time a lot of people will tell you to lean your head back this is the wrong thing to do according to the medical experts what you need to do is calm down try sitting if you can sitting is optional you want to apply a gentle pinching pressure to the bridge of your nose the upper narrow part about mid nose not closing the nose holes nares you want to keep them open a little you shouldn't be pressing too hard and your chin should be down on your chest stay in this position for at least minutes do not blow your nose for at least hours you may feel like you have a booger in your nostril but it is probably the blood clotting letting it coagulate harden during this time is important if you try to blow your nose or pick it it could likely bleed again quick recap head down upper bridge of nose gently pinched with nose holes open for about minutes and no blowing or picking afterwards medically speaking i hope this helps all who read this  Bleeding Nosebleed Aerial (dance move) Dog training Diving Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Skateboarding trick Traumatic brain injury Equine conformation Myocardial infarction The Apprentice 2 Drowning Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Yarrow Professional wrestling throws First aid Atherosclerosis Mucus Coagulation Common cold Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Stomach cancer Knife Wound Social rule Nile crocodile 1957 World Series Floppy disk Dialysis Pope John Paul I Sleep apnea Paracetamol Poker jargon Paget's disease of bone Massage Time Out of Mind The Contender (television series) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Columbine High School massacre Head Professional wrestling attacks Carbon dioxide The Amber Spyglass Boxing Blood plasma Lathe Backstroke The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Nose flute Cocaine Intracranial pressure Shaving Intravenous therapy Apoplexy Artificial respiration Medicine Blood pressure Warfarin Suplex Conspiracy (TNG episode) Urinary incontinence Tobacco Theory of conduct Pneumonia Triage Blood on the Tracks Textile manufacturing Horse Humphrey Bogart Tobacco smoking Emergency Medical Services Shock Childbirth Tourniquet The Subtle Knife Rosacea Hiccup Menstrual cup Jala neti Asana Clown Zhao Yun The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sin City Swingout Pressure point Maxilla Subdural hematoma Terminal ballistics The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular Fast bowling Hemorrhoid Shaggy dog story Violin Characters of Naruto Escape from New York

is it true you can bite off your pinky finger i heard you can bite off your pinky finger with the same force you use to bite a carrot is this true if the teeth were sharp yes it would be possible to bite your little finger off but would require a bit more force than biting a carrot as you have to cut through the bone and only if you could stand the pain a crazy person would be the most likely to be able to do this  Three Stooges Hand Bat Gesture Finger Doom enemies Drill bit Nail (anatomy) Harp Hamster Cat Double bass Professional wrestling holds Milton H.
