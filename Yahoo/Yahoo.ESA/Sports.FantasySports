what do you think of the vam value above mean drafting system i'm the th pick in a team league and vam says i should take steve smith with my th pick and grab a rb in the third round in the fourth i should take the best qb i had planned to draft rb rb wr wr so vam drafting is a very different approach what do think of the vam system i've just heard it called value based drafting but either way i think it is good and bad in man leagues i think it's less advantageous than in man leagues because when position runs hit you stand to lose a lot of depth at a position if you pick th i think it would be a good move to take smith or manning if he's available but you better use a pick on a rb too if you don't you have to wait until the th pick to get one if your league is like most the majority of the players will take a rb's in rounds that means your rb options will real thin by the time it gets back to you your spot the wrap is the best place other than you can be in because you'll have no anxiety about if your pick will be there for your next pic if i were you i would take either manning or the best wr in round a rb round a wr or qb round depending on what you took in round a rb round a def round a wr or rb in round and go from there a te will probably be your next pic but you can let that one slide a little because there are a bunch of good options at te this year i think your rb rb wr wr strategy isn't the best option for such a large draft because you'll never get the best player at any position unless you go def for your th pick  Archery at the 2004 Summer Olympics National Football League NFL Draft Super Bowl XXVII Chicago Bulls Pittsburgh Steelers Buffalo Bills New York Giants Minor league baseball Baseball New York Knicks NBA Draft Toronto Raptors Poker jargon Carolina Panthers Major League Baseball Blackjack Skateboarding trick Aerial (dance move) Playoff Equine conformation Draft (sports) New England Patriots Los Angeles Kings 1986 NBA Draft Lance Berkman New York Mets Volleyball Detroit Red Wings Orlando Magic Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.

why is peyton manning being shunned he is the pick in any draft is it just me or is manning being given the boot he is the number pick period i know steven jackson had a good er excellent season lj is good too gore might get yards if healthy and shaun alexander is in top shape but manning has been the best qb in fantasy football for almost a decade he is a lock for yards and tds he will single handedly hand you a win on several occasions he and lt are the only two guys that you know will give you multipe point weeks with yahoo scoring i think i have just as good of a chance picking up someone in the rd round that goes for yards than i do getting jackson gore or alexander with the second pick you know you can name rbs that could be the best in the league lt lj travis henry with denvers offense willie parker steven jackson clinton portis frank gore shaun alexander rudi johnson or edgerrin james could each have the best season but manning is uncontested as the best qb in the league of ff maybe last year he wasn't much better than them but he is so reliable you know without adoubt he will be good the others could have an off year peyton doesn't have off years he doesn't have a proven rb rudy johnson deuce or steve jackson and indy will throw if they want to win with the nd pick in the rd round one of those backs of another good back like westbrook or chester taylor or thomas jones might still be on the board ok this is my th season in yahoo did i miss something i play a random public league every year and qb touchdowns have always been pts last year kitna had the same yardage with less touchdowns and more ints than peyton this was kitnas best year ever and he still falls pts or pts week below peyton if you want to average out the last seasons then you are really wrong i really think that there is a larger drop off between the qbs than there are between the rbs obviously lt is the exception hence the in any draft i think manning can go anywhere after the rd pick notice most of the backs you mentioned will go from the st nd round outside of james if you take manning nd you would only wind up with one of them and really how much better is manning than palmer brady brees  September 2005 in sports Pittsburgh Steelers New York Giants Cleveland Browns New England Patriots NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Buffalo Bills Indianapolis Colts Super Bowl XXI NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Super Bowl XXVII Miami Hurricanes Football San Francisco 49ers Running back Super Bowl XXVI New York Jets American football National Football League Lore Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XXII January 2005 in sports National Football League New York Knicks Doug Flutie Steve Young (athlete) Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl XXV 2005 Pro Bowl Donovan McNabb November 2004 in sports October 2005 in sports Super Bowl XXXVI NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 December 2004 in sports Super Bowl XXXIV Jerry Rice Tennessee Titans Carolina Panthers Los Angeles Kings Super Bowl I Marvin Harrison Ryan Leaf Damon Allen Passer rating Super Bowl V Super Bowl IX Quarterback Super Bowl XIV Boston Bruins Indiana Pacers Super Bowl XIX St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XVIII Brett Favre Washington Redskins Super Bowl XI Super Bowl XXVIII Randy Moss Terrell Owens Cris Carter Super Bowl XXXV New York Mets Baltimore Ravens Denver Broncos Bernie Kosar Chicago Bulls Canadian football Miami Dolphins Super Bowl XII Daunte Culpepper Deuce McAllister Mike Vanderjagt NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl VI Tom Brady Super Bowl XX Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl XXIX Los Angeles Clippers Philadelphia Eagles Glossary of American football Minnesota Vikings Super Bowl II Super Bowl III Dan Marino American Football League United States at the 2000 Summer Olympics Super Bowl XXXIII Sixty-first United States Congress Thirtieth United States Congress Leeds United F.C.

yahoo answers fantasy football pet peeve i'm grumpy so i am ranting today don't you love questions like this rate my team qb peyton manning carson palmer rb tomlinson steven jackson brian westbrook wr steve smith marvin harrison chad johnson larry fitzgerald te antonio gates def chicago baltimore k jeff wilkins what would you do to improve this team please help me lame feel free to use your answer as a place to complain best complaint gets points ah i feel better already you guys are great i see in your futures some mysterious thumbs up appearing on your previosu best answers ya know its kind of interesting just because there is actually a better team you could make ahaha well in theory but honestly wtf is up with these people ya know its not actually the people who have the good teams that piss me off the people who have the good drafts and pick the good players those ones i don't mind its actually when those idiots think of picking a peterson in the rd round and hoping he has some mircale season those idiots who think that taking the entire football team bills in one of my leagues who piss me off when they ask is my team good rate those people deserve the most to be thrown out also the people who want better players in any fantasy sport but give us the person they wanna trade peavy for example and then don't give us the rest of their team or anything its just a flippin player we can only guess then those same people get mad at us because we suggest that they trade for somebody on their own team also our top leader you have got to be kidding me lets go on a rant shall we i admit i have answered some of those questions but its usually because its just join my league and then there is nothing after it this guy is only there because everybody seems to follow the white rabbit nobody ever hears him pick answer ask questions or anything that guy just answers those stupid questions and is in enough leagues well personally i am in football leagues a football pick um and a salary cap league and i want more i love my fantasy football the people who actually try here in these fantasy sports should be able to pick the top people if i had my way i would easily boot schyly or whatever it is off the top i can't predict the top but i know he wouldn't be there then there is when i ask questions wow i thank you crash baseball and fantasy for actually answering my damn best answer question about people here other than that i hate those word answer lazy stupid crazy all of that its worthless when you ask a question you expect an actual answer i got one and i gave my points don't get me going on voting for best answer instead of chosing one what hits me harder is when you put a huge amount of thought into an answer and then a person who puts a football team gets the best answer wtf is up with that screw that and everything else when you answer a question in fantasy sports more than likely that question won't be answered or voted on for best answer it sucks i just want an actual fair best answer selection and i give your team a your qb rb wr te def k are great but instead of fitzgerald i would take holt then it would be a ahahaha good luck edit sorry about the long complaint list i could just keep going if i needed to but i'm sure nobody wants to read this much crap ok one last gripe i answered this question about starting clark over shockey read it he choose the guy who had a line answer i'm surprised he didn't pick the guy who said shockey what a dumbass if you want a one word answer just ask for it  New York Giants National Football

in the st round is it better to draft a rb or a qb in a fantasy football league fantasy football and the rb draft strategy is simple supply and demand with nfl teams there are starting qb's with some teams using and wr sets there can be up to starting wr's but at minimum there are now with rb's some teams use a committee approach which means they don't have a guy getting all the carries they'll have someone play on rd downs or short yardage or whatever this means there are only about starting rb's in the nfl if you're in a team fantasy league and there are starting qb's at least are quality fantasy producers and wr's at least are quality producers and only rb's where only are going to worth anything then who should you go after if you can get a top rb in the first two rounds heck even rb's through rounds then go for it because in the th round you'll still be able to get a good qb and a couple good wr's people follow the rb rule for a reason and it's actually a pretty simple reason however if you're picking at the end of the first round and there are question marks surrounding all the rb's left and you can get a guy like peyton manning or carson palmer get them and then with your second round pick take a rb no matter what though get a rb early because no amount o f qb's and wr's can make up for not having a single rb last thing about rb's depending on the situation a rb will touch the ball something like times a wr won't be thrown to times let alone catch balss and some qb's and their systems won't throw times especially if they have a good d  New York Giants National Football League Cleveland Browns Canadian football Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl XXVII American football strategy Baseball Glossary of American football Playoff Super Bowl XXI Peyton Manning New York Jets Football (soccer) National Football League Lore NFL Draft Buffalo Bills Super Bowl IX Norway national football team Super Bowl XXV Carolina Panthers Ryan Leaf Rugby union Michael Vick Comparison of Canadian and American football Indianapolis Colts San Francisco 49ers Volleyball 2005 NFL season Australian rules football Football Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl III Water polo Super Bowl XXXI Indoor football Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XXVI Super Bowl XVIII Quarterback Gaelic football Wheel of Fortune Paintball Super Bowl XV Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl I Jerry Rice Miami Dolphins Daunte Culpepper Sudden death Super Bowl V September 2005 in sports New York Knicks Super Bowl XVII Wide receiver Damon Allen Ultimate (sport) World Football League Softball 1957 World Series Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl XXIII St. Louis Rams Draft (sports) Dominoes Dan Marino 2005 World Series Tampa Bay Buccaneers Punt (football) American Football League Playoff format Tag Match fixing Super Bowl VI Super Bowl XI Brett Favre Aerial (dance move) Green Bay Packers Bundesliga (football) Detroit Red Wings Rugby league FA Cup Cris Carter Golf Arena football Joe Gibbs Atlanta Falcons

im in a jam have decent starting core for fantasy but not real great backups what would be good acqusitions qb marc buler rb steven jackson wr reggie wayne dst broncos dst te todd heap player i can trade rb jamal lewis wr isaac bruce wr andre johnson wr deion branch wr eddie kennison your wr core is actually semi decent keep branch and johnson as for kennison and bruce see if you can pick up a running back like norwood or bell for kennison the chiefs offense is going to be centered around lj once he signs the extension with no actual qb there there isn't going to be much gonzalez will see most of the balls and then with bowe finally signing kennison won't see that much also with bruce he will most likely be passed up by bennett on the depth chart i would however keep onto him and try and lump him together with a guy like branch to see who you can get some guys like the wr's and some guys don't i wouldn't of course try for guys like harrison chad johnson but guys like glenn coles might be there for that trade lewis is really on the fence with me with brady just signing today he might still be the only offense out in cle country i would keep him though he isn't going to have that bad of year as everybody is thinking if you really wanna trade him you won't get the fantasy value you expect from him like the other guy said just keep waiting though after a couple weeks players will get hurt and start to stand out and that is when you start to pick them up the preseason is long and something always happens right now keep lewis johnson and branch for sure they won't have the best years but better than all those other known players on the fa list good luck  Cincinnati Bengals Buffalo Bills New England Patriots New York Giants Cleveland Browns Pittsburgh Steelers San Francisco 49ers New York Jets New York Knicks National Football League NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Carolina Panthers Baltimore Ravens Indiana Pacers Super Bowl XXVI Chicago Bulls Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XXI Steve Nash Boston Bruins Miami Dolphins Super Bowl XXXVIII September 2005 in sports Oakland Athletics Toronto Argonauts Super Bowl XXV Dallas Cowboys Stage name 1957 World Series National Football League Lore Ben Johnson (athlete) Running back Atlanta Falcons Wayne Gretzky Satchel Paige Pittsburgh Penguins Super Bowl XXXI Detroit Red Wings World Series Super Bowl XXXVI John Elway St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XII Oakland Raiders Toronto Raptors Boston Red Sox Los Angeles Kings Robin Ventura Los Angeles Clippers Tris Speaker Doug Flutie Jennifer Lopez Tampa Bay Buccaneers Reggie Jackson Minnesota Vikings Plame affair Grammy Awards of 2004 Super Bowl XXII Pete Sampras Janet Jackson Rod Stewart Super Bowl XXXV Super Bowl I ESPN25 105th United States Congress Eighty-second United States Congress October 2005 in sports Miami Hurricanes Football Home run Super Bowl XXXIII Indianapolis Colts Kurt Warner January 2005 in sports Ty Cobb New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Norway national football team Denver Broncos 108th United States Congress Andre Agassi New Zealand at the 2004 Summer Olympics October 16 in baseball 104th United States Congress NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Tony Bennett Seattle Mariners 107th United States Congress December 2004 in sports 2000 Australian Grand Prix New York Islanders Whitney Houston November 2004 in sports 106th United States Congress Washington Redskins

in nfl terms what does putting a committee tag on the backfield mean i was on my yahoo fantasy football team when i saw brandon funstons big er board of football i have marshawn lynch the rookie running back for the buffalo bills i looked up lynch on the big er board of football and it said the coach put a committee tag on the bills backfield if you know what it is please anwser thanx that means the nfl club as not designated a player as the starter at the running back position for example in san diego lt is the starter in green bay they have no starter yet so they are in the same situation as buffalo in seattle shawn alexander is the starter it really depends on whether the club has a proven running back who can carry the ball for all games effectively or not in those cases where it is committee the club usually splits the carries between or running backs in hopes that one will prove he is worthy of the starting spot sometimes though they use or guys and rotate them in and out throughout the entire season hope that explained it better  Pittsburgh Steelers Buffalo Bills Running back Cleveland Browns Super Bowl XXVII New England Patriots National Football League San Francisco 49ers Glossary of American football Miami Dolphins Super Bowl XXVI New York Jets St. Louis Rams Carolina Panthers Super Bowl IX National Football League Lore Super Bowl XXV American football strategy Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl American football Dan Marino Super Bowl XXIII Toronto Blue Jays Tampa Bay Buccaneers Super Bowl II Monday Night Football Super Bowl I Canadian football Quarterback Baseball American Football League Super Bowl XV Indianapolis Colts Comparison of Canadian and American football Los Angeles Clippers Seattle Mariners Super Bowl XXVIII Dallas Cowboys 1957 World Series Baltimore Ravens Pro Football Hall of Fame Kurt Warner October 2005 in sports Washington Redskins Doug Flutie Super Bowl III Professional American football championship games September 2005 in sports Super Bowl XIII January 2005 in sports Super Bowl XXXI Major League Baseball All-Star Game Oakland Raiders Super Bowl XXXIV Toronto Raptors Florida Marlins Super Bowl XXXII Seattle Seahawks Jerry Rice Minnesota Vikings Michael Vick Offensive team World Series Green Bay Packers Joe Gibbs Orlando Magic Super Bowl XIV Yao Ming Tennessee Titans 1986 NBA Draft December 2004 in sports International League Chicago White Sox Super Bowl VII Super Bowl X Atlanta Falcons San Diego Chargers NFL playoffs, 2003-04 San Francisco Giants NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Detroit Tigers Denver Broncos Super Bowl XXXV Football (soccer) Sam Adams (football player) 2005 World Series Super Bowl XVIII San Antonio Spurs Arizona Cardinals October 2004 in sports Ryan Leaf

which sp would u rather have kazmir or verlander kazmir has been nasty so far this nd half and verlander isnt doing well at all so i looked at his numbers in the nd half he had a era of about last season and it looks like it will continue he has a era of this season so far in nd half so should i trade him away in the end i believe that verlander is a better pitcher than kazmir kazmir will get more strikeouts but verlander gets more run support leading to more wins however he does have a tendency to struggle in the second half i would trade him while he's hot for a good player in return so for the second half i'd rather have kazmir but in general i would rather have verlander  Scott Kazmir Toronto Blue Jays Tampa Bay Devil Rays Nolan Ryan Randy Johnson Pedro Mart__nez Sandy Koufax Grover Cleveland Alexander Boston Red Sox Houston Astros 1957 World Series Seattle Mariners Baseball International League Baseball statistics Batting average Cincinnati Reds Baseball Stars John Smoltz Pittsburgh Steelers Roger Clemens Los Angeles Dodgers Curt Schilling Don Newcombe Kevin Brown Early Wynn Andr__s Galarraga November 3 in baseball Bob Friend Greg Maddux Satchel Paige Byung-Hyun Kim Oakland Athletics San Francisco Giants Jack Sanford Milt Pappas Pittsburgh Pirates Florida Marlins Hideo Nomo Hal Newhouser Detroit Tigers David Cone Chicago White Sox Doyle Alexander St. Louis Cardinals Lefty Grove Luis Tiant Robin Roberts (baseball player) World Series Bucky Walters November 1 in baseball Buffalo Bills Wes Ferrell Earned run average Carlos Zambrano Chicago Cubs Super Bowl XXVII 2004 World Series Jamie Moyer 1981 baseball strike Neal Cotts St. Louis Rams Joaqu__n And__jar Mark McGwire Barry Bonds Monte Ward Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946 November 4 in baseball Red Ames Tim Hudson Brad Radke Mariano Rivera Major League Baseball Wilbur Wood Washington Nationals Jim Palmer Al Leiter Firpo Marberry Dave Kingman Johan Santana Reggie Jackson New York Yankees October 3 in baseball A.J.

who should i pick rd in my fantasy football draft i would like to draft rb stephen jackson with that pick but he will most likely be taken i've been thinking of taking rb's larry johnson or frank gore what do you think i should do there's some useless advice take s jackson he's not going to be there don't even get your hopes up taking a qb is a bad idea when you won't get another pick until th overall at least and that's a small man snake draft which means the best you can do at running back in the second round is e james according to the yahoo bigger board and also can you really trust someone that says to take david addai come on like that guy has played fantasy football before it s joseph addai what i would advise you to do is take gore the hand is not a big deal and it will be healed by week just no playing time in preseason hand injuries won't affect his running his legs and power are still as strong as ever it could affect his catching and fumbling but i doubt it the hand is supposed to be healed and maybe it will encourage hands on the ball which wouldn't hurt as for lj he is a major risk that you don't want to pick rd overall lj s risk includes the holdout new qb can you say in the box lose of another pro bowl lineman and injury risk so many carries reminds me of what they did to priest the way they run him to death lj is a great back but what good is a great back if he sits out until week gore has just as much upside without the down side sfs offense is based around gore and they give opportunities similar to lj addai and alexander are obviously not on the same level of gore and lj and that's why you didn't even mention them addai should do a little under of what addai and rhodes did last year and tds that's not top material that's rudi johnson like numbers not lj i'm sure someone will spell him sub for him a little too or else that will bring up more injury risk hasn't proved that he can carry the load alexander is getting older and doesn't have hutchinson he struggled even before the injury alexander does have a lot of upside and he's my running back behind gore addai lj i worry about the hold out but gore has the best chance of winning you a championship if lj does end the hold out before your draft he'd move to my running backs i still think gore has a better chance to succeed even if lj doesn't hold out  San Francisco 49ers Pittsburgh Steelers New York Giants Cleveland Browns New England Patriots National Football League Buffalo Bills American football Super Bowl XXVI New York Jets Super Bowl IX National Football League Lore Glossary of American football Super Bowl XIII Fast bowling Carolina Panthers Kansas City Chiefs Aerial (dance move) 1957 World Series Indiana Pacers Brian Close Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XXXIV New York Knicks Equine conformation Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl X Norway national football team Professional wrestling throws Super Bowl XXVIII Miami Dolphins St. Louis Rams Los Angeles Kings Super Bowl V Professional wrestling attacks Super Bowl XIV Oakland Raiders Professional wrestling holds The Contender (television series) Los Angeles Clippers Super Bowl XXII Extreme Programming Super Bowl XIX Running back Poker jargon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Piccolo Junior Saga U.S. Electoral College Bryan Robson Iron Bowl U.S. presidential election, 2008 Minnesota Vikings Houston Rockets Leon White Super Bowl I Super Bowl III Super Bowl XVIII Rugby union Al Gore Ben Johnson (athlete) Plame affair World Series Super Bowl XXIII John Edwards Ryan Leaf American football strategy Super Bowl XVII Jacksonville Jaguars Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Professional wrestling slang Miami Hurricanes Football Super Bowl XXXVIII Canadian football ELO rating system English cricket team Super Bowl XII Good Times Toronto Raptors Super Bowl VII Philadelphia Eagles Satchel Paige Terrell Owens Tris Speaker Jack Charlton Instant-runoff voting Super Bowl VI Steve Nash Alex Ferguson Major League Baseball television contracts Utah Jazz Football (soccer)

should i make this fantasy football trade i get randy moss rudi johnson and hank baskett i lose marquis colston and travis henery that is a tough call if it was me i would say no first look at the rbs johnson is a consistent producer on a great offense he is almost guaranteed to get you around and at least tds henry had a good season last year with the titans but now goes to denver where undrafted backs become stars he has the potential to have a great season in their system possibly rush yards then compare moss and colston moss is going to have a better year with the patriots than the past few seasons with the raiders but he is no longer a clear cut elite wr on the other hand too many people are stuck on the fact colston had a great year last year he is moving into the spot and will see more coverage than before he still has a good shot to outperform moss though since the pats have so many weapons to spread the ball around to baskett is likely going to be the slot man for the eagles with brown and curtis starting he has the speed to break huge plays but will likely be highly inconsistent again this year therefore unless you really need baskett as a starting wr this trade is not worth it for you stick with henry and his huge potential  New York Giants New England Patriots Pittsburgh Steelers New York Jets Buffalo Bills National Football League Lore Cleveland Browns Running back Miami Dolphins Super Bowl XII September 2005 in sports Randy Moss American Football League Glossary of American football Kansas City Chiefs St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XV Indianapolis Colts Oakland Raiders Cris Carter Super Bowl XXI NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Super Bowl Super Bowl XIX American football Super Bowl III Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XXXIV NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XXXI Donovan McNabb Denver Broncos Super Bowl XI Super Bowl IX October 2005 in sports Super Bowl XXVI Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XXVII Wide receiver Madden NFL Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl V Super Bowl I NBA Finals Super Bowl XIII 1957 World Series Super Bowl X October 2004 in sports Tennessee Titans Super Bowl XXXIII Pro Football Hall of Fame Terrell Owens Super Bowl XXV Indiana Pacers Dallas Cowboys Minnesota Vikings National Football League Super Bowl XVII NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Super Bowl XXVIII Los Angeles Clippers New York Knicks Professional American football championship games Brett Favre American football strategy Norway national football team Super Bowl XVI Steve Young (athlete) Oakland Athletics Monday Night Football Super Bowl XXII Baseball Snooker Yao Ming Jerry Rice United States Football League World Series Kurt Warner Jake Delhomme Super Bowl XX Houston Rockets Seattle Mariners Poker jargon November 2004 in sports Buffalo Sabres Chicago Bulls January 2005 in sports Field hockey Toronto Blue Jays Anti-ballistic missile Damon Allen Miami Hurricanes Football NFL playoffs, 2000-01

what do you think of my team i just surfed through yahoo private leagues that were published and found one i like the settings in they must have drafted based on their favorite teams or something qb peyton manning matt leinart rb jaseph addai willis mcgahee duce mcallister marion barber wr anquan boldin andrejohnson vincent jackson reggie brown brandon jones te antonio gates randy mcmichael k jeff wilkins d miami denver this team is amazing and anyone who says that you are weak at wr doesn't know fantasy football boldin is moving to that z reciever slot in whisenhunt's offense that hines ward played in pittsburgh that should spell big numbers for boldin and andre johnson was the leader in receptions in the nfl last year and the texans are slowly but surely getting better and vincent jackson and reggie brown are now the recievers on their respective teams and should see huge numbers as for qb you have the best in the game your rb's are solid and i think addai will be a top back this year gates is obviously the best te in the game and wilkins plays on a high scoring team in a dome that is a recipe for success and i love miami and denver's defenses and from what i have heard this offseason miami's d is already looking like a dominating force  New England Patriots New York Giants Cleveland Browns Indianapolis Colts September 2005 in sports December 2004 in sports National Football League Lore San Francisco 49ers Super Bowl XXVI Buffalo Bills Miami Dolphins National Football League Super Bowl XXXI NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Super Bowl XXXVI American Football League Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl XXI Miami Hurricanes Football Super Bowl XXXV Indiana Pacers Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XIX January 2005 in sports NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XIII November 2004 in sports Super Bowl XXVII St. Louis Rams New York Jets Dallas Cowboys Super Bowl XXII Minnesota Vikings Cincinnati Bengals Randy Moss Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl VII Los Angeles Clippers Orlando Magic Super Bowl III Carolina Panthers NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Super Bowl XVI Denver Broncos Super Bowl XII Reggie Jackson Super Bowl XXIV University of Miami Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl X Super Bowl XXVIII Super Bowl XXV World Series Super Bowl XVII New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Utah Jazz Pro Football Hall of Fame Super Bowl XX Florida Marlins USC Trojans Football NFL playoffs, 2002-03 NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Super Bowl Jacksonville Jaguars Super Bowl XXXVIII Tennessee Titans Super Bowl XXXII Matt Leinart Denver Nuggets Houston Texans Brett Favre Canadian football Major League Baseball television contracts Reggie White New Jersey Nets Cris Carter Continental Basketball Association San Diego Chargers Super Bowl XXXIII Super Bowl XI Oakland Raiders Green Bay Packers Philadelphia Flyers Super Bowl VI Dream Team Toronto Argonauts Donovan McNabb

fantasy football who do you think s projected for a better season point wise lawrence maroney or jordan addai if you mean joseph addai i would guess him because bill belicheck loves kevin faulk as his rb on receiving downs and he also uses a lot of trick plays near the goal line like linebackers as te's or full back sweeps and stuff maroney will hold his own this but addai should be the every down back in indianapolis  Super Bowl XXXIV American football New England Patriots American football strategy Super Bowl XXVI Carolina Panthers Canadian football Defensive team New York Giants Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl I Super Bowl IX Indianapolis Colts Running back Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XXV Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl VI Super Bowl V Super Bowl XXVII Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl X National Football League Lore Super Bowl XXI Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XX Super Bowl III Super Bowl XI Buffalo Bills Hugo Award for Best Semiprozine Super Bowl XVIII Miami Dolphins Super Bowl XXIII October 2005 in sports Cleveland Browns Super Bowl XIX Academy Award for Best Picture Super Bowl NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Chicago Bulls Super Bowl XII Arena football New York Jets Wayne Gretzky Super Bowl XV Super Bowl XXXV NBA Finals Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl VII Super Bowl XIII Montreal Alouettes Super Bowl XXVIII St. Louis Rams Michael Jordan FA Cup Essendon Football Club Super Bowl XVI NFL Most Valuable Player Award Comparison of Canadian and American football Punt (football) Super Bowl XXXIII San Francisco 49ers American Football League All-Time Team Super Bowl VIII World Football League Super Bowl XXXII Kevin Keegan Pyramid (game show) Knots Landing Mystery Science Theater 3000 Crystal Palace F.C.

fantasy football help please this is my second year drafting but i know a lot about football however i never heard of the tier strategy until the other day how would you use a cheat sheet and the tier strategy would you reccommend it for these settings how do you use a cheat sheet do you cross off the players as they are drafted what would be your strategy for these settings thanks so much in advance qb qb wr wr wr rb rb te w r w r k def def bn bn bn bn bn bn completions passing yards yards per point points at yards points at yards passing touchdowns interceptions rushing attempts rushing yards yards per point points at yards points at yards rushing touchdowns receptions reception yards yards per point points at yards points at yards reception touchdowns return yards yards per point points at yards points at yards return touchdowns point conversions fumbles lost offensive fumble return td field goals yards field goals yards field goals yards field goals yards field goals yards point after attempt made sack interception fumble recovery touchdown safety block kick return yards yards per point points at yards points allowed points points allowed points points allowed points points allowed points points allowed points points allowed points points allowed points the tier strategy refers to your personal rankings of players for instance let's go with these rb's lt stephen jackson frank gore joseph addai shaun alexander travis henry larry johnson lawrence maroney brian westbrook willie parker rudi johnson my personal tiering would be st tier lt overall you can use more than one player per tier but lt is alone as the top rb nd tier stephen alexander i also think he's the clear cut rd tier shaun alexander frank gore joseph addai larry johnson and travis henry th tier brian westbrook willie parker rudi johnson and lawrence maroney as far as crossing off on a cheatsheet i would use a personally ranked cheatsheet do your own research and type one and print it up then use highlighters to cross them off my cheat sheets or cross off lists are tiered and seperated by position i wouldn't use an all position sheet because you may end up searching for ever for a player because he's on a list of or so if you seperate them they're a little easier to find now my draft strategy is to always grab as many quality rb's as possible because if you break it down there are really only starting rb's in the nfl because teams use a running back by committee approach where they split up the duties depending on situation or what have however since you guys start qb's i would suggest trying to get a top qb but don't reach if you can stock up on rb's i don't know how many teams are in your league but i'm going to assume if i'm right then you guys will start qb's per week and there are starters so the supply outweighs the demand whereas with rb's and your w r position where people will use rb's your demand outweighs good supply same supply and demand deal with wr's each nfl team starts at least and some or so you can say there are about or so starting wr's and at least who will be on the field at all times in your league with starting wr's and the w r position the supply outweighs the demand so get yourself two quality rb's and depending on whose available at your next pick go with the best player unless the rb is only marginally less better than the other position for instance don't pass up on lawrence maroney for a carson palmer because in another round or two you'll still be able to get a guy like matt hasselbeck or maybe even donovan mcnabb at qb but your rb's will be players like lamont jordan etc i would draft as follows st rb nd rb rd rb unless a huge star at another position far outweighs the quality of rb that's available there will be few teams with quality backs so you might as well be one of them th qb or wr you will need star qb at least th qb or wr you will need star wr so in round and take qb and wr depending on who's the best player at their position in those rounds th wr th wr th qb i usually like to wait on te's k's and defenses the reason is that the disparity in the top players at these positions is only something like a scoring change whereas the other position is far greater your rb will outscore your rb by over whereas your k will only outscore your k by the aforementioned now it sucks not having a top player at k te and d but if you take the best player available instead of filling in your lineup while you draft then you'll have quality players on your bench that you can trade once you see where the te's k's and d's are performing even chicago may not produce awesomely so why waste a high round pick on them when you can get a good wr instead and then trade for d if the one you drafted doesn't work out my sleepers at te are eric johsnon no who has the chance to be top if he stays healthy marcus pollard who works for a coach who loves using his te's and david martin in mia who'se coach also loves his te's you can get these guys late and cheap for defense i love seattle they picked up some awesome free agents for an already tough d maybe the best linebacking core with tatupu and peterson i don't have any at k as i usually use my last two rounds on k's and if i really need an upgrade at the position then i'll trade for one my strategy with k's is obvious though indoors is better especially late in the season and you want a k from a high point scoring offense  Super Bowl II Cris Carter New York Knicks Super Bowl XXXVII Indiana Pacers Dan Marino 2005 Pro Bowl Daunte Culpepper November

why do so many people want you to rate their team it's ridiculous and it's always people who are in or team leagues where rosters are so stacked no one really knows how good a team is until the season start and the players distinguish themselves speaking of the season not starting a really decent assessment just can't be had until a couple weeks into the season someone could have lt to peyton and steve smith for example in a team league which is freakin amazing but then they can all go down in the first week for the season and all of a sudden your team sucks if you're one of the people asking please stop do some research and analyze your team yourself i understand that you could never get the players i mentioned in a team league that was my point douche my other point was that its morons like you who have these loaded teams because you drafted in an team league and then you come on here looking for someone to your hold no analyzation can be made about a single team without knowing what the other teams look like and what the rules of the league are it gives people something to talk about i like looking since it gives me ideas on how some people draft and thier though process both from the asker and the answerers people love playing fantasy football and they want to talk about it as soon as the the camps start to open if everyone did thier own research then there would be no need for a yahoo answers website and both you and me would need to find something else to do with our time  National Football League New England Patriots Super Bowl XXVII Minor league baseball New York Giants Playoff American Football League Peyton Manning National Basketball Association Major League Baseball New York Knicks Sudden death Canadian football Baltimore Ravens American football Carolina Panthers World Football League Jacksonville Jaguars Chicago Bulls Buffalo Bills Rugby league Indianapolis Colts Newcastle United F.C.

should barry bonds numbers count or not should he be able to break the record or not i say yes there were a ton of other players that were doing it and it was not illegal in baseball at the time not that that makes him right i wish he would retire today but he was not alone i'd love to know how many pitchers he faced that were juiced up it should count but everyone who follows baseball will know what barry was all about and they can decide for themselves if they recognize it as the record or not there's not much mlb can do about it he never got caught he's going to hit more homers than hank aaron end of story but it won't matter for long alex rodriguez will break the record soon enough  Barry Bonds Hank Aaron Home run Baseball 1957 World Series New York Yankees September 20 in baseball 2004 World Series Willie Mays World Series San Francisco Giants October 22 in baseball October 20 in baseball Reggie Jackson 2004 American League Championship Series September 6 in baseball Baseball statistics Major League Baseball All-Star Game November 1 in baseball Atlanta Braves Detroit Tigers Stolen base June 8 in baseball St. Louis Cardinals Seattle Mariners June 12 in baseball Boston Red Sox Softball Top 500 home run hitters of all time Sammy Sosa Roger Clemens Satchel Paige September 28 in baseball Texas Rangers (baseball) Albert Pujols Babe Ruth October 7 in baseball Sandy Koufax Baseball Stars David Ortiz Nolan Ryan Ted Radcliffe Andr__s Galarraga 2005 World Series Pittsburgh Pirates Dave Concepci__n October 31 in baseball History of baseball in the United States October 3 in baseball Oakland Athletics Rafael Palmeiro Troy Glaus October 10 in baseball Ken Griffey, Jr. November 3 in baseball Cinergy Field Intentional base on balls Pete Rose Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Lou Gehrig Cincinnati Reds Manny Ram__rez Red Sox Nation Jimmie Foxx International League Hank Greenberg Pedro Mart__nez Los Angeles Dodgers Tris Speaker Unassisted triple play October 4 in baseball October 27 in baseball Sadaharu Oh June 2 in baseball Roger Maris June 10 in baseball 1919 World Series MLB Most Valuable Player Award Baseball (object) Ty Cobb Perfect game Pittsburgh Steelers October 5 in baseball July 2004 in sports Washington Nationals Starting pitcher Negro league baseball Cleveland Indians Major League Baseball titles streaks Miguel Tejada Chicago Cubs Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Mike Schmidt October 19 in baseball Montr__al Expos Baseball scorekeeping

fantasy football what is fantasy football i keep seeing it like everywhere and why would you play football in a fantasy instead of real life god bless britany fantasy football is an online game you can play instead of real football this is how it works each team or player takes turns picking real life players for example team a takes peyton manning team b takes tom brady each player can be taken only once therefore the further you go in the draft the process of selecting players the worse the players available are basically you pick a quarterback some running backs receivers tight end kicker and defense an entire team's defense as the season progresses your team will gain more points if the players on your team perform better in real life therefore if manning gets touchdows and brady gets the team with brady will get more points as the season goes on you accumulate points so if your players do well in real life your team does good therefore you must pick players that you think will do good  American football New England Patriots New York Giants National Football League Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XXXVI San Francisco 49ers Pittsburgh Steelers Canadian football National Football League Lore Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XXI Cincinnati Bengals Buffalo Bills Super Bowl IX Kansas City Chiefs Quarterback Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XXVI Super Bowl XXIII Michael Vick Comparison of Canadian and American football Super Bowl XII Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XIV Norway national football team Dallas Cowboys Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl X Wide receiver Miami Dolphins Cleveland Browns 2005 NFL season Indianapolis Colts American football strategy Super Bowl III Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl XVI Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XXXII Fantasy football (American) NFL Draft Super Bowl VI American Football League Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl V Ryan Leaf Super Bowl I Defensive team Super Bowl XXVIII St. Louis Rams Jacksonville Jaguars Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl XXXIX Super Bowl VII Denver Broncos NFL playoffs, 2004-05 John Elway Oakland Raiders Baltimore Ravens Joe Paterno Super Bowl XV The Football League Arena football Super Bowl XX Tom Brady Rugby league Joe Gibbs New York Knicks Donovan McNabb Orlando Magic Super Bowl VIII Randy Moss Super Bowl XXIX NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Water polo Yao Ming Lineman (football) Super Bowl IV Football (soccer) positions Minnesota Vikings NBA Finals Miami Hurricanes Football Final Fantasy XI Gaelic football Iron Bowl

why does everyone play multiple teams this is my third season playing fantasy and i've always just ran with one team i'd hate to have to do the research and effort i put into my one team every week for two three even four teams yet a lot of owners in my winners league are playing multiple teams i can see why you might play teams one year if you're trying to get into the winner's level next year but whats the point after that doesnt it take away some of the agony and ecstasy when you have different teams playing every week how can you root for your players any given week on one team when you're playing against them on another and then people stop playing the teams that go and by week and you're matched up against teams whose starters went on ir weeks ago i just dont get it i wish they'd limit you to one team per account on yff oh and rate my only squad please i was drafting rd from last first time i had such a low draft pick so it was a new experience for me willie parker rb maurice jones drew rb marc bulger qb larry fitzgerald wr andre johnson wr hines ward wr chris cooley te jamal lewis rb bernard berrian wr matt leinart qb julius jones rb jerry porter wr carolina def nate kaeding k desmond clark well what about all the teams you give up on its not like you can delete them they keep going on autopilot and frankly it ruins the game for the rest of the league they're in that's still paying attention its not much of an accomplishment winning a man league if the other players abandoned their teams for ones that got better draft position be a man stick with one team come hell or high water and show how good you really are at ff you have a great point there are many reasons why people have more than one team though they like doing live drafts and enjoy drafting with other players they use them as a mock draft at the beginning of the season for money leagues later in the season as practice they think they have the time to handle everyone to tell you the truth this is my first year for fantasy sports and i have fantasy baseball leagues and fantasy football leagues i enjoy doing the drafts but have much more than i can handle it is way too much to change the lineup everyday for fantasy baseball on every team but some how i do it i won't be doing so many leagues next year though i have never done fantasy football so i have no clue what it is like i know that you only have to change the lineup once a week so you can handle more than one team it would be tough to do all that research and effort in every team you have a great point and i will think twice about having more than teams next year good luck edit for your only team lol you have a great squad i would wait until the season starts before changing anything i hate doing trades before the preseason at least because you don't know how your players will do you might have a player that you want to trade now but he is incredible in preseason i would wait before doing any moves  National Football League New England Patriots New York Giants Pittsburgh Steelers St. Louis Rams Minor league baseball Super Bowl XXVII Cleveland Browns New York Knicks Chicago Bulls Dallas Cowboys Carolina Panthers Los Angeles Clippers Playoff Major League Baseball Baseball National Basketball Association Buffalo Bills World Series Toronto Raptors San Francisco 49ers 1981 baseball strike American Football League Minnesota Vikings Cincinnati Bengals New York Jets New York Mets Babe Ruth Leeds United F.C.

new to fantasy football what does waiver selection mean when it says waiver out of basically when a player gets dropped off a team he goes to waivers which means for a week everyone has a chance to pick him up after the week if no one claims him he goes to free agency and anyone can get him right away if someone claims him while he's on waivers they get him once the waiver period is over unless someone with a higher waiver claims him too so say someone drops chad johnson from their team he goes to waivers the guy with the waiver tries to add him you can try to pick up johnson too and since you have the higher waiver number you'll beat him however if the person with the waiver tries to add him too he'll beat you once you successfully win a waiver you drop down to last place and everyone else moves up one but usually most people that get cut end up going through waivers with no one claming them and go to free agency which means you can pick them up if you want them without sacrificing your waiver spot the big thing you'll use your waivers for mostly is if someone makes a for or for trade etc and needs to clear room off his roster they might release a player that's decent in that case and there might be some competition to pick him up usually players that get cut are ones that just really suck or are out for the year with injuries etc though you'll also hear people use the expression get someone off the waiver wire that's just an expression that means picking someone up out of free agency for instance you might only have one defense or kicker and if its on bye you'll need to pick up another defense or kicker off the waiver wire to fill in for the week  Pittsburgh Steelers National Football League New England Patriots New York Giants Carolina Panthers Cincinnati Bengals Kansas City Chiefs San Francisco 49ers American football Buffalo Bills Toronto Blue Jays Super Bowl XXVII New York Knicks New York Jets Dallas Cowboys Toronto Raptors Scientology beliefs and practices International League Los Angeles Clippers Utah Jazz National Football League Lore Plame affair Norway national football team Super Bowl XXXVI Rugby league New York Islanders Rugby union Canadian football Miami Dolphins Fantasy football (American) Cleveland Browns Super Bowl XXI Glossary of American football Wheel of Fortune Seattle Mariners Chicago Bulls Lewis Libby National Hockey League All-Star Game GunBound Comparison of Canadian and American football Super Bowl XXXIV Newcastle United F.C.

what is the best way to do ir spots in a fantasy football keeper league on yahoo yahoo does not allow ir spots because once nfl players are put on ir they are done for the season thus there would be no reason to keep them on your fantasy team unless you have a keeper league my recommendation is to set up a rule as the commish of the league this rule would be that if someone on your team is put on the ir and you wish to keep him then the league allows you to drop him and pick up another player the dropped player must then remain in the free agent pool until you want to pick him up again at the end of the year also i would make sure that the rule is you only get one player in this manner if you end up with two you must announce to the league which you are dropping for good or keep the second on your roster  National Football League American football New York Giants American Football League Kansas City Chiefs Major League Soccer Pittsburgh Steelers Salary cap Canadian Football League Cleveland Browns NFL Draft Buffalo Bills Jacksonville Jaguars Fantasy football (American) Los Angeles Clippers Chicago Bulls Draft (sports) Playoff National Football League Lore Major League Baseball Fantasy baseball Reserve clause New England Patriots Baseball Stanley Cup International League World Football League Comparison of Canadian and American football NFL Europe Dallas Cowboys Cincinnati Bengals National Hockey League Minor league baseball Football (soccer) 2005 NFL season Terrell Owens Indoor football FA Premier League Cleveland Cavaliers Super Bowl XXV Arena football Orlando Magic Rugby league Glossary of American football Baltimore Ravens Sudden death Jerry Rice Seattle Mariners Major professional sports league Dominoes Rugby union United States Football League South Australian National Football League XFL San Francisco 49ers Super League (Australia) Super Bowl XXVII Norway national football team Detroit Red Wings 2004-05 NHL lockout Minnesota Vikings St. Louis Rams National Hockey League All-Star Game Super Bowl XXI Pete Rose Toronto Raptors Monday Night Football New York Mets The Football League Official (American football) Chicago Bears Super Bowl XXXIV 2004-05 in English football Pittsburgh Pirates Ricky Ray Playoff format Essendon Football Club Michael Jordan Lamar Hunt Chicago White Sox New Orleans Saints NFL playoffs Toronto Blue Jays Indianapolis Colts Miami Dolphins Nottingham Forest F.C.

should i take this trade i trade driver delhomme and ward and i get walker and cutler i already hav holt ward m calyton and k curtis as my wr cutler is a big upgrade over delhomme and that is good walker and driver are a wash and your throwing in ward thus the difference between delhomme and cutler i don't know who your starting qb is or if delhomme is your starter so to make an informed decision first i'll assume they are your starters i would then say yes make the deal because you are upgrading your starting qb position and only down grading your st receiver off the bench if neither of these qb's is your starter then i'd pass on this trade because you are not helping your starting line up and your losing a potential bench spot ask yourself if you'd trade delhomme and ward for cutler the answer is yes if he is your starter and no if he is your nd string qb make sense  Carolina Panthers Jake Delhomme New York Jets Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl XXVII Toronto Raptors Pittsburgh Steelers New York Giants 1986 NBA Draft Kurt Warner Ricky Ray Toronto Blue Jays NFL playoffs, 2003-04 New York Knicks Detroit Tigers Indiana Pacers Yao Ming Cleveland Browns 1957 World Series Chucky Pancamo Drag racing Henry Cow Donovan McNabb New England Patriots Starting pitcher Windows Vista Red Sox Nation History of Microsoft Windows Super Bowl IX Tris Speaker Indianapolis 500 Vernon Schillinger Pedro Mart__nez Florida Marlins Damon Allen David Wells Reggie Jackson October 2005 in sports Baseball James K.

is this a good ff trade i give him tom brady and brandon jackson and i get willie parker and marion barber iii i also have payton jake delhomme but my running deanglo williams and vernand morency my wr are steve smith javon walker darrell jackson i have gates and the chargers d and nate k just let me know what you think about the trade because i need a good rb you win by a landslide in this trade willie parker is a top back and thus a top player and the player of closest comparison is tom brady brady is a good qb but i would not lose sleep over losing him the difference between a qb you can get in rounds and vs rounds and is not close to the difference between rbs in this range that is the sole reason that rbs are picked before qbs i would be very surprised if this trade gets accepted who else does he have at rb that he is willing to trade these players away by payton do you mean you have peyton manning i am a bit surprised that you would draft him and brady actually either of them period but i guess that would make sense considering the rest of your team my advice would be in your next draft s do not draft with the intention of trading it never works out as it should this is merely because other people are drafting to fill their needs independent of trades they may make someone who sees that you have that depth at qb automatically gets a leg up on the deal because you need to get rid of the qb to cash in on his value as you can't play two i think if you are the one offering the trade i assume so that you need to be a little more realistic try offering brady for say cedric benson straight up good luck brother  New York Giants Buffalo Bills Super Bowl XXXVIII Toronto Raptors Chicago Bulls Pittsburgh Steelers NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Super Bowl XXVII San Francisco 49ers Carolina Panthers New York Knicks Running back Minnesota Timberwolves 1986 NBA Draft New York Mets Oakland Raiders Super Bowl XXXVI NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Satchel Paige Walter Payton Days of our Lives Gary Payton (basketball) Orlando Magic Cleveland Cavaliers Wheel of Fortune December 2004 in sports $ale of the Century Eli Manning Los Angeles Kings Cincinnati Bengals Detroit Red Wings Norway national football team Poker jargon San Antonio Spurs Los Angeles Clippers Cleveland Browns Celtic F.C.

fantasy baseball trade points league managers i get prince fielder he gets paul konerko dan haren adrian beltre should i do it who gets the better deal this is also a keeper league so i would probably be keeping prince for next year i would definately do this deal a trade at this point in the season is going to have a very minimal effect as far as standings at the end of this year go as far as the trade fielder is better than konerko even if you would not be keeping him at the end of the season it is debatable whether adrian beltre actually helps your fantasy team or not i personally would not play him and regardless you can easily find a more than capable backup on waivers same with haren you won't find a pitcher of quite his status on waivers but you can definately find someone suitable solid fantasy starting pitchers are a dime a dozen in the middle rounds of the drafts see sabathia and brad penny are extreme success stories this year from the middle rounds but this is where i typically grab all of my starters because pitchers with very few exceptions are extremely variable and lets be serious you're not keeping any of these players at the end of the season anyway think of this trade in terms of that you are combining players statistics that you wouldn't want to keep into one player that you definately would this deal would be great at any point in the season and is especially valuable in that you can take fielder with you at the end of the season for very very little  Baseball 2005 World Series Toronto Blue Jays Chicago White Sox Baseball statistics Boston Red Sox Oakland Athletics Indiana Pacers Houston Astros Los Angeles Dodgers Softball Major League Baseball Carlos Beltr__n Alex Rodriguez Kansas City Royals New York Yankees Detroit Tigers National Football League Detroit Red Wings Barry Bonds Pittsburgh Pirates Robin Ventura New York Giants New York Knicks Baseball Stars Reggie Jackson Randy Johnson 2004 World Series Texas Rangers (baseball) New York Mets Paul Konerko Negro league baseball Fantasy baseball Nolan Ryan International League New York Jets John Smoltz Minor league baseball Roger Clemens 1957 World Series October 15 in baseball Tris Speaker Ichiro Suzuki Florida Marlins 1919 World Series Los Angeles Clippers Pedro Mart__nez Greg Maddux Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Babe Ruth Dallas Green Cleveland Browns Chicago Bulls Fielding (cricket) Toronto Raptors Hank Aaron Hank Greenberg Lance Berkman Yao Ming World Series San Francisco Giants Damon Allen Cincinnati Reds Major League Baseball All-Star Game Hideo Nomo Arizona Diamondbacks Carolina Panthers Designated hitter October 23 in baseball Rickey Henderson November 1 in baseball Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945 Utah Jazz Super Bowl IX Los Angeles Kings November 2 in baseball St. Louis Cardinals 2003 World Series St. Louis Rams Dixie Walker Cricket Pittsburgh Steelers MLB Most Valuable Player Award David Wells Cleveland Indians Frankie Frisch Bernie Williams New England Patriots Atlanta Braves October 2004 in sports

is this a good trade i get payton manning he gets donovan mcnabb matt jones and philadelphia i think its good matt jones is a chump and is third on the jax depth chart no loss there mcnabb was the top qb in fantasy befefore he got hurt and there's the key tossing in the philly defense is a small price to pay for that kind of consistency and reliability with manning the guy is a rock and is a sure tds the only risk and it's probably a small one is that tarik glenn retired from the colts o line he's been a critical cog in that line we don't yet know how this will affect manning or addai for that matter still if you have any kind of decent defense i'd take that deal manning is worth it plus you can use those two free roster spots to speculate on other players for your bench including a replacement defense do it  New York Giants Donovan McNabb New England Patriots Philadelphia Eagles Indianapolis Colts Pittsburgh Steelers September 2005 in sports Toronto Raptors Los Angeles Clippers NFL playoffs, 2003-04 NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Carolina Panthers Oakland Athletics Terrell Owens American football Cleveland Browns Tris Speaker Philadelphia Phillies National Football League Lore Super Bowl XXXIX New York Knicks NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Cincinnati Bengals 2005 Pro Bowl Dallas Cowboys Seattle Mariners New York Jets Gary Payton (basketball) Kobe Bryant Super Bowl III Baseball January 2005 in sports Houston Astros Buffalo Bills Ra (board game) Indiana Pacers Tax Utah Jazz Super Bowl XXVII International League Chicago Bulls NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Baltimore Ravens NBA Finals December 2004 in sports Donovan St. Louis Rams Pete Rose November 1 in baseball Boston Red Sox Houston Rockets Ian McNabb The Waterboys Microeconomics Poker jargon Toronto Blue Jays Glossary of American football Leeds United F.C.

whose more likely to pick up saves in texas benoit or wilson in the first save opportunity after gagne was traded the rangers stuck with c j wilson even though travis hafner was the only lefty due up in the ninth it worked out as wilson retired the side in order in a two run game then the very next day wilson struck out the only batter he faced lefty kenny lofton to record the save after joaquin benoit pitched innings of scoreless relief to get the win wilson has been so terrific against lefties that he doesn't make sense as a full time closer still he'll probably get a few more opportunities before the season is over my choice for a pickup would be benoit however he has gotten many more chances to work in close games than he did last year has a era a whip and strikeouts in innings this season wilson has such a wide disparity between how he does facing righties and lefties that he is likely only to get the call when a lefty is coming up at the end of the game even then it is possible they will use him in the th or th inning instead one other thing to bear in mind is that texas' first choice to close is probably akinori otsuka but according to the dallas morning news his forearm injury still isn't and the most realistic date for his return might be september there have been some rumors that otsuka may need tommy john surgery but the rangers' training staff is reportedly working on setting up a throwing program for him so i wouldn't count him out just yet he might be the closer in september if he became healthy  1957 World Series Baseball Sandy Koufax Satchel Paige Pedro Mart__nez Billy Wagner Chicago White Sox Nolan Ryan Los Angeles Dodgers World Series Toronto Blue Jays Babe Ruth Texas Rangers (baseball) Detroit Tigers Andr__s Galarraga 2001 World Series Softball October 5 in baseball 1986 National League Championship Series Lefty Grove 2004 American League Championship Series Grover Cleveland Alexander Houston Astros Seattle Mariners Chicago Cubs Perfect game Rich Harden 2005 World Series Jamie Moyer Washington Nationals International League October 4 in baseball October 21 in baseball Oakland Athletics Lefty G__mez Roger Clemens 2004 World Series St. Louis Cardinals Closer (baseball) Byung-Hyun Kim Strikeout Hank Aaron Florida Marlins Buffalo Bills Dennis Eckersley October 3 in baseball Mariano Rivera A.J.

do you take into account a player's coach when you draft for example on my draft board brandon jacobs is in line for my rb but i won't touch him because he plays for tom coughlin coughlin who keeps his son in law chris snee on the giants roster is his own worst enemy coughlin calls horrible offensive plays his unwillingness to use tiki barber last season was stunning also he benched kurt warner for eli manning a decision that as more time passes loses its luster eli isn't peyton heck he's not even kurt warner so i see giants starting the season the calls for coughlin's firing will be loud come thanksgiving do you pass over players in the draft because of their coach please share names and reasons i do actually but more as a byproduct of the system they create rather than an individual coach the easy example is taking players from high flying offenses run by say a mike martz flying circus philosophy in other words i will favor players where the coach isn't afraid to fling it or one where players are often put in a position to succeed the hooded one in new england loves to pound the ball in from inside the corey dillon made a living punching in short tds sometimes the opposite is true even in a productive offense after clinton portis left i avoided denver running backs like the plague because shanahan is too quick with the hook on running backs who fumble or don't block well tom coughlin your example is classic he's exhibiting the same irrational behavior he did in jacksonville he seems to take a personal affront to any player with the audacity to question his decision making fred taylor suffered a similar fate to tiki's  New England Patriots St. Louis Rams Cincinnati Bengals Denver Broncos Cleveland Browns Buffalo Bills Kurt Warner San Francisco 49ers Jacksonville Jaguars Carolina Panthers Running back Pittsburgh Steelers Glossary of American football Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XXV American football Eli Manning Super Bowl XXXIV September 2005 in sports Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl IX October 2005 in sports Kansas City Chiefs Baseball National Football League Oakland Raiders Volleyball Toronto Blue Jays Super Bowl XXXV Toronto Raptors Super Bowl XXXIII Donovan McNabb Super Bowl XXI Miami Dolphins One Tree Hill (TV series) National Football League Lore Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl XXIV Orlando Magic Water polo Montreal Canadiens November 2004 in sports Florida Marlins Super Bowl XXVI Dallas Cowboys Ice hockey Peyton Manning Super Bowl XXXIX Los Angeles Dodgers Super Bowl XII New York Knicks Indiana Pacers Cris Carter Houston Rockets Ron Dayne Minnesota Timberwolves NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Detroit Red Wings Super Bowl V Babe Ruth Steve Nash Washington Redskins Los Angeles Clippers Snooker San Antonio Spurs Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Baltimore Ravens New York Islanders Tag December 2004 in sports Softball English cricket team Canadian football Andr__s Galarraga Los Angeles Kings National Basketball Association Cleveland Indians Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Super Bowl X Super Bowl III Lineman (football) Offensive team Super Bowl XI World Series 2005 NFL season Cincinnati Reds Super Bowl XIV Chicago Bulls Green Bay Packers Rugby union Jumpstart 3rd Grade St. Louis Cardinals

rate my fantasy football team please it's a team league here's my team qb peyton manning rb reggie bush rb marion barber iii wr chad johnson wr lee evans wr calvin johnson te vernon davis w r adrian peterson bn bernard berrian bn mike furrey bn jerry porter bn matt schuab bn randy mcmichael bn reuben droughns k olindo mare def san diego please tell me how i did what i did good and what i did bad what i need to improve anybody i should add drop and any trades that i should make if you want to you could also rate it thanks hey i was offered this trade what do you think i get reggie brown and fred taylor and i give bernard berrian so should i accept thanks for the tips your team is actually not bad but you do have room for improvement for another draft here is what i suggest don't take peyton manning or a quarterback in the first rounds period in general there are exceptions if you get the right value this is hard to grasp for newer fantasy players simply for the fact that quarterbacks earn the most points the problem lies in the statistics specifically the standard deviation of the top qbs besides manning the reason for not picking him is slightly different but related all the same the difference between say a matt hasselbeck and a say trent green as i am drawing a blank for a good comparison at the moment is not great im comparison to say reggie bush compared to a lamont jordon there are better examples of this but i'm just trying to get the gist across there are definately instances where you should pick a qb earlier but it is only when the value is right there is no real way to definatively explain how to do this as you kind of have to get a feel for it this is where experience comes into play pick feature backs a big hole in your team which isn't terrible but could hurt you as far as scoring consistancy is concerned is that you have backs starting that split carries i like reggie bush and i would pick him where you did he is phenominal and i think he is one of the most exciting players to watch in the nfl his pass catching ability which is really derived from the type of offense no runs makes him consistent points wise barber though i go to the u of m and love him could potentially be a dangerous pick you could see the trend of dallas giving him more and more carries throughout the year especially in goal line and rd down situations but he is still not getting all of the carries he is not a bad back in the least and you will be happy with the tds which is what scores points are concerned but he will have some weeks in which he scores points which hurts from your back stay away from rookies again just as a rule though i have to say calvin johnson and ap are not awful picks rookies can potentially be complete busts and generally do not come close to reaching the levels they are hyped to achieve even a rookie who has a good year may not have a stellar year fantasy wise much less is expected from rookies when compared to veterans so their stats are judged accordingly remember numbers are important not names in this game as far as the rest good pick on the d i think san diego is the nd best d this year d is not important in fantasy again because they are extrememly inconsistent from week to week olindo mare is just fine pick a kicker in the last round if you want it really doesnt matter though i have to say this year i have been reaching for better d's and kickers because i have been getting depth fairly early and can afford it i'm sure you can do the same one last thing be careful of drafting too many big play recievers their overall numbers are good and they can win you a week all by themselves but to win a fantasy football league your team has to be consistent in other words you don't want your reciever core to be joey galloway lee evans santana moss evans was no doubt the best guy available when you got him but again i'm just giving you general hints anyway good job not a bad team in the least  Super Bowl XXVI Super Bowl XXIII NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Donovan McNabb Indianapolis Colts Super Bowl I Super Bowl XXI Chicago Bulls Super Bowl IX Randy Moss Super Bowl XXIV Toronto Raptors

for a brand new fantasy football league how many keepers we're starting fresh with an team league that hopefully will grow to or in the years to come we're thinking a keeper league allows the teams out of the running to have something to shoot for next season how many keepers do you recommend for a standard league any other suggestions to keep the whole season interesting especially for those teams already out of the playoff picture the key to a keeper league is finding owners who are keepers people who will play every year owner turnover will wreck a keeper league we keep players per year one from each tier the st tier are rounds of the draft nd tier are rounds and tier are including all free agents picked up during the course of the season so for next year everyone decides on one keeper from each tier then each keeper moves up into the next tier the following year last year i got jones drew as a free agent he's my tier keeper obviously and he moves up to tier for next year if i keep him as my tier next year he moves up to my tier the following year and i''l presumably have a guy like s jackson in tier as well so i have to make a decision forcing me to throw a good player back into the draft for someone else or i trade him in the offseason another cool thing about keeper leagues every year the draft order is reverse of last year's standings and after year one since you're keeping players the draft lasts rounds instead of i can give you more details on year two and beyond if you are interested the ideal number of teams is teams aren't too stacked talent isn't too thin good fa pickups all year but teams still need to make trades let me know if you're interested in using this system and i can fill you in on all the details you need to know  National Football League Pittsburgh Steelers Detroit Red Wings New Jersey Nets New England Patriots New York Knicks Buffalo Bills Major League Baseball Super Bowl XXVII San Francisco 49ers Utah Jazz Indiana Pacers Toronto Raptors American Football League Minor league baseball Orlando Magic New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Baltimore Ravens St. Louis Rams Cleveland Browns Reggie Jackson Oakland Athletics Carolina Panthers Playoff The Football League Mario Lemieux Yao Ming Cleveland Cavaliers Blackburn Rovers F.C.

would you trade randy moss for terrell owens in my league i'm being offered ownes for moss the only reason im hesitating is because tony romo showed signs of inconsinscy last year and brady is for sure thing wow a lot of people are split on opinions here i would personally take this trade and here's why sure randy moss is with a prime time quarterback in tom brady but look around him donte' stallworth wes welker ben watson troy brown tom brady is not known as a quarterback to have one reciever he mainly throws to like when moss was in minnesota but as a quarterback who likes to use all of his weapons and spread the ball around and this was before when his best reciever was deion branch so imagine what tom brady will do with all of those different weapons he's not just going to focus on one guy he'll do what he does best spread the ball around that's what makes tom brady such a good quarterback so don't expect randy moss to have one of those seasons like he had in minnesota with daunte culpepper but don't expect him to have one like in oakland either he should have a decent season but not an outstanding one now with the to thing terrell owens is in a dallas system where his only competition for touchdowns is terry glen and jason witten and they aren't even that big of competition terrell owens although he is very cocky and selfish is still one of the top recievers in the nfl no matter what to proved last year that even with a weak starting quarterback for a few weeks in drew bledsoe he can still lead the league in recieving touchdowns i'm confident that tony romo can come into this season and return to his prime form but even if he can't he will somehow find a way to throw owens touchdowns so eventhough romo may not have a stellar season and tom brady is one of the best quarterbacks in the league trade away randy moss for terrell owens  Super Bowl XXXVI NFL playoffs, 2004-05 San Francisco 49ers National Football League Lore Buffalo Bills Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XXXIX Super Bowl XXXI September 2005 in sports Terrell Owens Donovan McNabb Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl X Dallas Cowboys Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XXVI St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XII Tom Brady Super Bowl IX Oakland Raiders Baltimore Ravens Miami Dolphins Super Bowl III Super Bowl XXXVIII Daunte Culpepper National Football League October 2005 in sports NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl XXIII December 2004 in sports Minnesota Vikings Super Bowl V Super Bowl XVII Washington Redskins Super Bowl XVI Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl I Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XV Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl XI October 2004 in sports Carolina Panthers Monday Night Football Jerry Rice January 2005 in sports Super Bowl II Super Bowl VI Steve Young (athlete) Brett Favre Super Bowl XXXV NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Madden NFL Ben Roethlisberger Super Bowl XVIII Drew Bledsoe Super Bowl XXVIII Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XXII Pro Football Hall of Fame World Series Super Bowl VII Quarterback Super Bowl XXX American Football League NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Bernie Kosar Indianapolis Colts Super Bowl XXXIII NFL playoffs, 2000-01 Toronto Argonauts NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Super Bowl XXIX Ricky Ray Boston Red Sox Trent Green NFL playoffs, 1998-99 Doug Flutie Canadian football Trent Dilfer Detroit Tigers Toronto Blue Jays

i'm thinking about trading jeff garcia for big ben good idea big ben is way higher than garcia in fantasy points he's higher by like ninetysome points but the projected value which is what i'm paying attention to is not that far off somewhere between points difference should i go through with this trade also i'm seriously thinking about trading alge crumpler i don't see him having a good year with harrington as his qb any idea who i should trade for i rank big ben way above garcia i have ben as my starting qb in a team and i have no concerns about him if the steelers really are looking to be more aggressive then i think they have the weapons to pull it off garcia is on the bucs and the bucs are not an offensive team i can't see the garcia putting up numbers like he did on the ers big ben is on the way up and garcia is on the way down big ben by a mile over garcia trading crumpler depends on your rbs and wrs if you need more depth then i would go for a rb or wr and then grab a te off the waiver wire if you believe you are strong at rb and wr then try to trade for another te you'd must likely have to package another player with crumpler to get anyone better or else deal with another team who is not aware of michael vick's situation yeah good luck on that one crumpler should still have a decent year and should still end up in the top falcons have a weak wr core and crumpler will be the target for harrington i'd explore my options in trading crumpler but i wouldn't panic and try to force a trade  Pittsburgh Steelers NFL playoffs, 2002-03 NFL playoffs, 2004-05 December 2004 in sports New England Patriots Indiana Pacers Poker jargon Kasparov versus The World Diablo II: Lord of Destruction New York Knicks Final Fantasy XI Super Bowl XXVI Boston Red Sox National Football League Super Bowl XXVII Michael Vick Chicago Bulls Ben Roethlisberger Tampa Bay Buccaneers Glossary of American football Donovan McNabb Baseball Team Fortress Classic Seattle Mariners Supply-side economics Tight end Joey Harrington San Francisco 49ers Greenville, North Carolina Jeff Garcia Yao Ming Steve Nash Ra (board game) Knots Landing Cleveland Browns Pok__mon Trading Card Game Super Bowl IX Resident Evil (video game) First Battle of the Atlantic Major League Baseball television contracts American football strategy Warrior (World of Warcraft) Boston Bruins Galactic Civilizations Nickname Utah Jazz Minnesota Vikings October 2005 in sports Chess strategy and tactics Chicago White Sox Scientology beliefs and practices ELO rating system Cincinnati Bengals Basketball Yu-Gi-Oh!

do you buy draft boards for your fantasy football draft and which brand of draft board do you recommend we're hosting a new league this year with several first time managers we've seen ads for these products in the fantasy football index and the cbs sportsline draft magazines prices we've seen are which is very doable for our event there are a ton of these out there the link i gave you is fine nothing sexy but reasonably priced if you picked up a fantasy magazine this year look for promotion codes and you might find a cheaper version the key is having self adhesive labels color coded by position if you're getting that and a decent sized cardboard grid you're good to go it seems like the more half naked girls they prop in front of them in the ads the more expensive they are you shouldn't have to pay more than i've seen them as high as and that's unnecessary we love having it it's proven to be a fine addition to our draft tradition  Wal-Mart Apple Macintosh New York Giants Mutual fund NFL Draft Crossword Football (soccer) Newcastle United F.C.

is clinton portis going to last the whole year i'm thinking about taking portis as my second starter for my fantasy football team but im not sure if he will play should i take him in the rd round i don't think he will survive the whole season he's had tendinitis in his knees bad enough to keep him out of practice and will be seeking yet another medical evaluation with off season shoulder and knee surgeries and the emergence of laddell betts portis smells like a bust to me betts proved he could carry the load he had over yards with only starts at the very least he will take some of clinton's cheese i would take him if he slides into the third round but i have him flagged as a player to avoid i wouldn't hesitate to reach for betts perhaps as early as the th round the kid can play  New York Jets Denver Broncos Super Bowl XXVII Pittsburgh Steelers New York Knicks New York Giants Miami Hurricanes Football New England Patriots Running back Daunte Culpepper West Bromwich Albion F.C.

who would be the first three picks in fantasy football i have the third pick by the way he should i hope to get ladainian tomlinson frank gore and steven jackson should be the first picks in every league tomlinson is the consensus though you wouldn't want to win your league by drafting him because it would take away from the accomplishment if he has another dominating season gore is every bit as good as tomlinson and on a san francisco team that is poised to make it back to the playoffs and contend for the super bowl jackson is probably the sure thing because he wasn't last year's rushing leader the rushing leader usually gets hurt the following year edgerrin james was the last to repeat winning rushing titles in and though he got hurt in and he doesn't have a history of injuries in college and the td scoring problems that gore has had some people will tell you to draft larry johnson shaun alexander or peyton manning in the top larry johnson is holding out and will probably get hurt if he does play about a chance that he isn't worth a st rounder at the end of the year shaun alexander wasn't all that good last year even before the foot injury and probably isn't worth taking until at least the rd or th round by which time he's long gone peyton manning is a quarterback and it is a waste of a draft pick to take a qb early you can get of the value of a top tier qb in the middle to late rounds such as matt leinart phillip rivers tony romo or jay cutler just to name a few all of them should throw for yards and tds while peyton manning is likely not to surpass yards and tds you should always take rbs and wrs in the first rounds or so in rounds you should try to get a qb romo rivers leinart etc should be available and your te you won't get the elite few but you'll be able to get a jason witten vernon davis or kellen winslow though otherwise rbs and wrs are still the best picks in rounds you should take another qb and more backs and wrs in rounds and or whatever the last rounds are in your draft you should take your kicker and defense  New England Patriots Super Bowl XXVII Cleveland Browns New York Jets September 2005 in sports Cincinnati Bengals Carolina Panthers Buffalo Bills American football Super Bowl XXI Peyton Manning Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl IX National Football League Lore Miami Hurricanes Football NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 National Football League NFL playoffs, 2003-04 New York Knicks Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XXXIV October 2005 in sports Super Bowl XXVIII Dallas Cowboys Running back Donovan McNabb Baltimore Ravens St. Louis Rams Los Angeles Kings Super Bowl X Super Bowl III Super Bowl VI Super Bowl XXX Super Bowl XIII San Diego Chargers Super Bowl XXIV December 2004 in sports Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XXXV Super Bowl XII Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XV Damon Allen Indiana Pacers NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Tennessee Titans Super Bowl VII November 2004 in sports Super Bowl XXXII USC Trojans Football Michael Vick Chicago Bulls Los Angeles Clippers Super Bowl XX NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Detroit Red Wings Denver Broncos Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl IV Dan Marino NBA Finals San Antonio Spurs Ryan Leaf LaDainian Tomlinson Brett Favre Super Bowl XXXIII Canadian football Oakland Raiders Terrell Owens 2005 Pro Bowl Super Bowl XXXVIII Doug Flutie January 2005 in sports Super Bowl VIII Marvin Harrison Matt Leinart New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Michael Jordan Iron Bowl Toronto Raptors Super Bowl XXXVII

is this deal fair i give up a ramirez e bedard al reyes tb closer i get miggy cabrera j smoltz my closers are already m rivera b myers soria h street al reyes so is this deal good for me and can i afford to give up al reyes with my current group of closers thanks this is a team h h non keeper league if that info helps thanks dgknsd k thanks for the reply i guess the only concern i have is if i have enough closers to cover the loss of al reyes because all the closers are snatched up in the fa pool dgknsd very good thanks again you get arguably the nd rd best third basemen in the game arod then a tossup between miggy and david wright and you get a great pitcher bedard is doing well for a bad baltimore team with great strikeouts and great peripheral stats however smoltz is more consistent and is not too shabby himself on strikeouts the addition of mark teixeira and dotel will help him get wins as well which helps you out in fantasy tex will get rbi's and dotel a former closer would be a great setup man probably better than wickman reyes was a surprise this year but if you are getting these two you can afford to trade him away try to find some closer on the wire of if you can't find one get a relief pitcher that has great k's whip and era like hideki okajima or pat neshek edit i just read your closers i must have read over them you've got decent good closers mariano is doing well but has not got a lot of saves this year cause of the yankees inability to give him chances in the first half of the year but has been doing much better lately myers did well in the role before getting injured and i do believe he will continue to dominate and soria has shown good things with the way alan embree is pitching street might not close until late august september i still advise you to try to find another closer on the wire or a great relief pitcher in a non keeper league this trade would suit you but in a keeper league what you gave up would be more than you get miggy is a great keeper but smoltz has to regress eventually aram is a young guy who should be doing better in years to come not as well as miggy but you have to accept that tradeoff bedard is a pitcher who has shown flashes of genious in the past but has finally put it together this year and will be or should be one of the top pitchers in the league for years to come al reyes is just filling in until the rays find a good enough player to usurp his throne as closer however this being a non keeper league the trade is in your favor and in a team league the wire should have decent players to replace what you give up in the trade had this been a team league the trade is more intriguing and harder to pull the trigger on as the wire would offer bench players and perhaps a platoon player at best with reliable closers i do believe you can afford to get rid of him having three closers is the norm anyways you had one more than what most fantasy players use it is a good strategy though i tried that out this year and drafted five closers on a few teams i owned saves whip and era and was able to trade the closers i had to a team that didn't for a premium do the trade before he tries to rescind it lol at the thumbs down perhaps you guys should just give a good thorough response instead of do it it's good for you  2004 World Series Babe Ruth Oakland Athletics International League World Series Boston Red Sox 2003 World Series Sandy Koufax Mariano Rivera 1957 World Series Cincinnati Reds New York Giants New York Yankees Roger Clemens Detroit Tigers Florida Marlins Atlanta Braves November 2 in baseball Pedro Mart__nez 1919 World Series Pittsburgh Pirates Closer (baseball) New York Mets Chicago Cubs Robin Ventura Houston Astros Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Chicago White Sox San Diego Padres Nolan Ryan October 22 in baseball Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Baseball statistics Alex Rodriguez Save (sport) St. Louis Cardinals Los Angeles Dodgers 1981 baseball strike October 31 in baseball October 4 in baseball Ty Cobb Andr__s Galarraga Greg Maddux Pitcher Pittsburgh Steelers November 1 in baseball Tris Speaker October 13 in baseball Randy Johnson Leeds United F.C.

what is the deal with all these trades already the season doesn't start for weeks there's no way to know exactly who will be ok who will be injured etc any of the qbs top rbs and top d etc will be just as good as any other on opening week just stock up with sleeper free agents and wait for people to come calling during the season it's crazy to overthink preseason trades don't you think thank you someone with half a brain i haven't made a football trade since and have made it to at least the championship game in all of my leagues much less trading in the preseason when nothing has happened yet the only reason i would consider trading a guy is if i heard something about a player such as injury that is relatively unknown and hope that other guys haven't heard about it but that is so unlikely keep your players that you draft through at least the first couple of weeks why else would you draft them the idea of the draft isn't to trade away players at least not until a few weeks into the season  National Football League New England Patriots Cleveland Browns New York Giants Carolina Panthers Toronto Blue Jays Bernie Kosar Chicago Bulls Buffalo Bills Super Bowl XXVII Pittsburgh Steelers St. Louis Rams Donovan McNabb Orlando Magic Dallas Cowboys Terrell Owens Detroit Tigers Oakland Athletics Jacksonville Jaguars Baltimore Ravens Playoff New Jersey Nets New York Jets Boston Red Sox Alex Ferguson Bristol Rugby Qu__bec Nordiques Sammy Sosa Ryan Leaf Indiana Pacers Oakland Raiders Seattle Mariners Kansas City Royals Kansas City Chiefs Minnesota Vikings Arena Football League Super Bowl XXXIV Major League Baseball San Francisco 49ers Houston Rockets Dan Marino Cincinnati Bengals Utah Jazz Tampa Bay Buccaneers Damon Allen Kobe Bryant John Elway Minor league baseball Yao Ming Miami Dolphins Women's National Basketball Association Toronto Raptors Philadelphia Eagles American Football League New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Green Bay Packers Los Angeles Kings San Antonio Spurs Jerry Rice 2004-05 in English football Atlanta Falcons Minnesota Timberwolves Chicago Cubs USC Trojans Football Doug Flutie Poker jargon Football (soccer) Ipswich Town F.C. 1981 baseball strike St. Louis Cardinals Wayne Simien Exhibition game Bryan Robson West Bromwich Albion F.C.

need advice on fantasy football what position to pick first hi i was wondering if anyone can tell me what is the best order to pick positions or should you pick by players i know the first round its best to just get the best player you can like lt but what order should i pick players is it best to draft a quarterback first or defense or running back etc thanks so much for your help also if you have any good info on sleepers and people to avoid i really appreciate it i dont want to look like an idiot in my husbands league and ive tried to searching but everything these days requires money to get advice its commonplace to pick a running back in the first round the only exception would probably be peyton manning but only if you're at the bottom of the order running backs will normally get you the most points also look at your rules as points are given differently in all leagues not sure how much you follow football but if you're drafting soon i'd stay away from larry johnson who will be near the top of most lists there's no guarantee he'll be playing this year just some friendly advice good luck to you you'll do fine  National Football League New York Giants Pittsburgh Steelers NFL Draft Peyton Manning Canadian football Buffalo Bills Kansas City Chiefs NBA Draft American Football League Super Bowl XXVII San Francisco 49ers Baseball Carolina Panthers Rugby league Glossary of American football Quarterback Michael Vick Draft (sports) The Football League Ryan Leaf Miami Dolphins National Basketball Association Rugby union New York Jets National Football League Lore Gaelic football Salary cap New York Knicks New Mexico Lobo Basketball Dallas Cowboys Wide receiver Comparison of Canadian and American football Poker jargon Los Angeles Clippers Super Bowl XXI Pok__mon Trading Card Game Indianapolis Colts Major League Baseball Match fixing Norway national football team Cleveland Browns Super Bowl IX Chicago Bulls Miami Hurricanes Football Cheating in poker Tennessee Titans Super Bowl XIV Running back Toronto Raptors Fantasy football (American) John Elway Touch football (rugby league) Football Baltimore Ravens January 2005 in sports Playoff Torquay United F.C.

anybody else play in a ffl where you have to start qb's each week just about every ffl website and magazine is based on a system where you only start qb each week which way undervalues qb's compared to a league where you have to start we have a team league and have to start qb's each week so it changes things a lot just wondering if anybody else is in a similar league and how that setup impacts your draft strategy i'm mulling a lot of options right now like going qb qb wr wr with my first picks and then getting a bunch of rbbc guys and hoping a couple of them pan out our league is really competitive and i'm trying to consider some outside the box ideas to see if i can come up with something that might work we start rb's wr's and te no kicker we do individual defensive players too which i think is awesome it adds more dimensions to strategy options i drafted demeco ryans as my sleeper pick at lb last year and he ended up being the highest scoring defensive player in the league unfortunately i also had mcnabb and mark brunell without a jason campbell handcuff so that didn't work out so well yes i do team league you still have to get two rb's in the first two rounds then probably next would be two qb's or one qb and one wr just make sure your qb's have different bye weeks and try to get three because after the draft you will be stuck with them do to the rest being taken if you need to trade for a qb in this type of league they are worth as much if not more than rb's so get on them early and don't be afraid to get extra to use as trade bait  National Football League New York Giants Carolina Panthers Pittsburgh Steelers Playoff Super Bowl XXVII Minor league baseball American football New York Jets New England Patriots Poker jargon FA Cup Dallas Cowboys New York Knicks Bundesliga (football) Ra (board game) Philadelphia Eagles Glossary of American football Baseball Buffalo Bills Canadian football Cincinnati Bengals Donovan McNabb Los Angeles Kings Rugby league Detroit Red Wings The Inside Paintball Super Bowl XXXVI Softball Alex Ferguson Yao Ming San Francisco 49ers September 2005 in sports Los Angeles Clippers Ultimate (sport) Wheel of Fortune Utah Jazz National Hockey League All-Star Game Comparison of Canadian and American football Ice hockey Kansas City Chiefs Terrell Owens Super Bowl IX Toronto Raptors League Cup National Football League Lore Super Bowl XXVI American Football League Counter-Strike Playoff format New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets NBA Draft Tris Speaker Ty Cobb Chicago Bulls Nolan Ryan Major League Baseball National Hockey League Steve Nash Topps National Basketball Association Tampa Bay Buccaneers Extreme Programming Volleyball Oakland Athletics International League Gaelic football Robin Ventura Jokerit Dallas Mavericks Troy Glaus Canterbury Bulldogs Draft (sports) NFL Draft Miami Dolphins Indiana Pacers FC Rostov The Apprentice 2 Brett Favre Norway national football team Ryan Leaf World Series Orlando Magic Atlanta Flames National Rugby League Penalty shootout (football) Leeds United F.C.

how should i set up a single list for the best results in an automated fantasy football draft i am playing in a fantasy football league on fox sports last year i tried my own mathmatical strategy for an automated draft but it bombed it is a single list of players and i would like to get good running backs and a qb in the first three rounds teams playing any suggestions for how many at each position i should choose and in what order to accomplish this would be helpfull thanks i've cut and pasted a long answer to another person's similar question the six team league will change the formula a bit and i don't know how fox's algorithm works but i thought the basic info might help you regards i've often thot about doin' an article for y sports about how to autopick successfully i managed to get a gold silver and bronze medal out of fantasy basketball teams last year via autopick for woohoo football's a little tougher but you can do it there are two main schools of thought reaching and reverse drafting one reaching if you're willing to skip say your fifth round pick you can reach for the rest of your draft rounds to are fairly predictable pre rank or leave y standard at least for rb's and wr's drop or exclude the qb's or you could end up w both bulger and brees too much value on the bench so assume picks are off the board by the time your th pick comes around you should then look to the player ranked or higher in the draft preferably by adp average draft position but the y pre rankings will do and put that ordinarily th round player in expecting him to be your th round pick repeat w player for the th then for the th etc multiples of of course if you're in a team draft in y leagues where the algorithm will autodraft a starting lineup before it moves on to the bench the computer will reach for the te's def and kickers for you so make sure none of them are ranked above in team it will take your highest ranked te df and k you may want to put bal or chi above the te's thus rounds will be a te df and a k still worse i think the algorithm will force you to take a backup of at least two of those positions killing rounds after the draft you can trade 'em or exchange 'em from best available on the waiver wire but again that's why it'd be important in this strategy to keep your kickers all the way to the bottom your second choice is to pre rank a reverse draft one guy did it in my y autodraft league very successfully reverse draft means to keep the first two rounds but do 'em only with rb's then insert gates at pick bears and vinatieri at that point you should have two good rb's including at least one stud and the premier te d and k it's now round a lot of live drafters will have waited til now for vyoung or kitna so you can put in two mid tier qbs selections if you want and you can play matchup managment qb by committee through out the year default will let you pick qb's and you don't want that so be sure not to put in more than names then just rank wr after wr the theory behind the strategy is to have the best scorer per position at the most positions you can use the strategy in a live draft but it's suitable for an autopick if it works you'll have the three best at te d k will be very competitive at the two rb spots as well as the wr after the top or so wideouts are gone wr's are all about the same and you should be okay at the qb and wr the drawback you'll be lacking at wr from the first week flyover and nobody can really predict the best d or k but reverse drafting can field a good team either method can be made more effective if you know your draft position ahead of time but we rarely do i'd be interested to know how it turns out stay up late pre ranking regards  National Football League New York Giants Poker jargon Baseball Pittsburgh Steelers Norway national football team Carolina Panthers Cleveland Browns Playoff Rugby league New York Jets Canadian football Quicksort National Basketball Association Los Angeles Clippers New England Patriots San Francisco 49ers American football strategy Super Bowl XXVII Archery at the 2004 Summer Olympics Rugby union Tag Yao Ming Chicago Bulls Single Transferable Vote Prisoner's dilemma Cincinnati Bengals FA Cup Glossary of American football Toronto Raptors Bundesliga (football) Counter-Strike Troms__ I.L.

i traded away julius jones and steve mcnair for edgerrin james and byron leftwich was this a good trade once i get james and leftwich i'm thinking about dropping byron for jeff garcia should i do that either one is my backup qb after tom brady anyway absolutely this trade is not even close edge is well underrated this year as he could potentially be a top back again and is definately a solid number back i wouldn't even want julius jones on my roster barber is going to score of dallas' rushing touchdowns i would be surprised if jones gets more than red zone carries this year the only reason he still gets playing time is because they invested so much money in him with his rookie contract barber is the future back in dallas and is becoming the now back as well mcnair and leftwich is sort of a toss up but at least you know mcnair is going to play football this year who knows with leftwich you sure pulled a fast one on that guy  New England Patriots New York Giants Super Bowl XXXIV Pittsburgh Steelers St. Louis Rams NFL playoffs, 2003-04 September 2005 in sports Carolina Panthers Buffalo Bills San Francisco 49ers Super Bowl XXI Donovan McNabb Super Bowl XXV National Football League Lore Jacksonville Jaguars Cleveland Browns Super Bowl XII Super Bowl XXXVI Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XIII NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XXVI Super Bowl V Super Bowl XXXV Super Bowl XXXVIII Running back Super Bowl XV Tennessee Titans Super Bowl X October 2005 in sports NFL playoffs, 1999-2000 New York Knicks Cincinnati Bengals Steve McNair Super Bowl XIX American football Super Bowl VII Super Bowl III Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl IX NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl XXII Tom Brady Boston Bruins Super Bowl XXX Montreal Canadiens Dallas Cowboys Super Bowl XXXIX Miami Dolphins Washington Redskins November 2004 in sports Major League Soccer Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl XXVIII Major League Baseball television contracts American Football League New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Baltimore Ravens Professional wrestling throws National Football League Super Bowl XX NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Super Bowl XVIII International League Philadelphia Flyers Baseball Kyle Boller Super Bowl XI Super Bowl XXIX Super Bowl VIII Toronto Blue Jays NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Marshall University British Columbia Lions History of Test cricket (to 1883) Steve Nash Doug Flutie Terrell Owens Knots Landing Canadian football Damon Allen Fast bowling January 2005 in sports Chicago White Sox PGA Tour Boston Red Sox Walter Payton San Antonio Spurs Ricky Ray December 2004 in sports Miami Hurricanes Football

fantasy baseball help guerrero and accardo for braun and konerko a trade has been offered to me i would trade away vladamir guerrero and jeremy accardo and i would get braun and konerko if arod ends up on the angels next year guerrero might have a better year than braun and konerko combined this is a keeper league so i am not sure what to do please help wow very intriguing trade both for the reason of there are many ways you can look at it and because the players are not very comparable but the trade seems pretty fair as far as the rest of the season goes this is a pretty fair trade but think who are you going to keep for your keeper league are you going to keep vlad yes are you going to keep accardo absolutely not not to mention the fact that bj ryan will likely re assume the closers role next year which dwindles accardo's value considerably ryan braun has had arguably better numbers than ryan howard had in his similar situation the first time he was brought up look how he has turned out this deal is completely contingent on whether or not you believe ryan braun will continue the pace of his hitting or not i personally think he is the real thing to an extent though his sick numbers he has put up will likely level out you are probably not going to want to keep konerko unless you keep really really deep which i doubt if this trade were not in a keeper league i would say by all means pull the trigger if you need the offensive help i think both of you will be extremely happy with the trade i would probably not make this trade just from the standpoint that you will keep vlad one of the top fantasy players in baseball even if you are really hot on ryan braun he will probably be available again i'm not sure how many players you keep by the time you draft if he is not kept people will be more apt to draft prooven players with those first picks than to take a flier on braun very intriguing trade but i would hold on to vlad on account of having him in the future  2005 World Series Baseball Chicago White Sox Oakland Athletics Vladimir Guerrero Seattle Mariners Nolan Ryan Toronto Blue Jays Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Major League Baseball Washington Nationals Minor league baseball Pittsburgh Steelers San Francisco Giants Alex Rodriguez New York Mets Utah Jazz National Football League New York Giants Los Angeles Kings Houston Astros Randy Johnson Robin Ventura Boston Red Sox St. Louis Rams Cleveland Browns Yao Ming Final Fantasy XI Los Angeles Dodgers Glossary of American football Los Angeles Clippers Eddie Guerrero Reggie Jackson Microeconomics Andr__s Galarraga Softball Dracula Pittsburgh Pirates Paul Konerko Indiana Pacers Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Team Fortress Classic American football Computer role-playing game San Antonio Spurs Chicago Bulls Vlad III Dracula Babe Ruth Ty Cobb American Football League Super Bowl XXVII Draft (sports) Theodicy Batting average Hank Aaron Toronto Raptors Texas Rangers (baseball) NBA Draft Goodness and value theory Detroit Tigers 2005 American League Championship Series Chicago Cubs Legacy of Kain Major League Baseball television contracts October 23 in baseball Baseball statistics Ryan Leaf Topps Montreal Canadiens Troy Glaus International League Mario Lemieux Atlanta Braves New York Knicks 2004-05 NHL lockout Roger Clemens Red Sox Nation Chris Benoit Martin Heidegger November 2 in baseball World Series Home run Poker jargon Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Xiaolin Showdown 1981 World Series Orlando Magic Theory of conduct Science fiction on television

will eric moulds be reciver for vince young i need to know bc the projected reciver in available in my fantasy league my qb is vince young he probably won't be the number but he will get most of the balls there is a big debate going on about this and honestly i think he is going to be the number with jones being as young as he is its really hard for a young qb to count on a guy like that vince is going to find moulds more often than not just because he is the veteran most likely moulds will put up pretty good starts for a rd receiver on a team i wouldn't draft him though he honestly right now isn't worth that draft pick vince will end up having more trust in a guy like moulds who has been around the block a couple times and has seen many different qb's even though he had a bad year last year expect moulds to come out of his shell on the other note look for jones to have a big year as well with moulds teaching him his stats should continue to go up as the year goes i wouldn't draft moulds but i would probably pick him up after the draft is done good luck  Toronto Raptors Pittsburgh Steelers San Francisco 49ers New York Giants New York Knicks National Football League Super Bowl XXVII Cleveland Browns Super Bowl XIV Carolina Panthers 2000 Australian Grand Prix Norway national football team 1957 World Series New England Patriots Vince Carter Washington Redskins Sheepshead Detroit Red Wings St. Louis Rams Chicago White Sox Atlanta Flames Piccolo Junior Saga Oakland Raiders Super Bowl Eric Bischoff Paul Levesque Steve Nash Brian Close Mark Calaway Draft (sports) Yao Ming Winning Streak Vince McMahon RuneScape quests Wayne Gretzky New York Mets 1986 NBA Draft Frank Viola Theory of conduct New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets World Championship Wrestling Paul Wight Philadelphia 76ers NFL Draft Penske Racing Dallas Cowboys Montreal Canadiens Kansas City Chiefs Brett Favre Oakland Athletics Troms__ I.L.
