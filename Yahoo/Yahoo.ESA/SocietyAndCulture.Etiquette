what is the proper way to handle when your husbands's co has a holiday party and spouses aren't invited its a night time function not a luncheon during the work day i think that's rude considering the owners are millionaires i didn't take it out on him he went i did call the office and spoke to the secretary in conversation told her i thought it rude maybe i'm the tacky one hah lol foxhound your just a jerk there were no wives there as the secretary put it the owners are single so that is why they arranged the party as they did they are all young rich preppy guys that are single and my husband does not work there anymore he has his own company i might i add will he ever be as rude as the guys that run the company mentioned in my question didn't asked to be insulted but if it makes you feel better good for you some people just go on here to purposely put down and trash people not answer a question just wanted some insight not insults my husband went for a few hours came home doesn't work there anymore has his own company didn't yell at the receptionist learn to read people her and i had a civilized conversation about it i haven't heard of company holiday parties that didn't include dates or spouses seems suspicious that they would have a sausage fest their intent must have been to invite only single women as well you are a more tolerant wife than i am i absolutely wouldn't have encouraged or supported my husband attending a function that would be inappropriate for a wife to attend i suppose if it were mandatory then my hubby would be putting in the standard hour appearance and then bowing out since it was a holiday party then it was not part of the work day and they wouldn't be getting paid for attending so to leave out partners is completely inappropriate  Plame affair Social rule Marriage Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Avenue Q Mojave people The Star Wars Holiday Special Haven (TNG episode) George Galloway 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Fiddler on the Roof Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sydney Riot of 1879 The Catcher in the Rye Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Time Out of Mind EastEnders Late Night with Conan O'Brien Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Extreme Programming Philosophical skepticism Alan Keyes Singlish Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Good Times Plame affair timeline Marilyn Monroe Montreal Screwjob Divorce Rosa Parks Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Donald Neilson Married... with Children Kodocha Past teachings of Prem Rawat Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Little Britain George Brown, Baron George-Brown One Tree Hill (TV series) Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 Iranian presidential election, 2005 Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Pip (South Park episode) The Catherine Tate Show Big Brother (USA TV series) Rick Santorum The Emancipation of Mimi Recurring South Park characters The Inside Same-sex marriage in Canada ECW One Night Stand Rais massacre 50 First Dates Teresa Heinz Kerry The Smoking Room The Lovely Bones Lauren Bacall Jewish services Babe Ruth's Called Shot Friends Mail-order bride David Blunkett Russian joke Domestic violence Blood on the Tracks U.S. presidential election, 2008 LiveJournal Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Germaine Greer Reaction to the assassination of John F.

have you ever made a racist statement we have all had the slip of the tongue moment in our lives i am just wondering how many have had it happen with a racial slur if it has do you think maybe you are holding back some racist feelings or was it due to something else just wondering interesting question as some groups are particularly sensitive and it is difficult to say or think about their culture or anything else relating to them without them thinking that you are racist so do you mean have i said something overtly racist or just a criticism of a culture which might be taken because it is derogatory of the culture as racist i suppose the answer is yes on both counts though because i actually said i feel certain racial groups are quite sensitive so i suppose i'm a racist for that  Nigger Avenue Q Racism Brian Griffin Scientific racism Race and intelligence Afrocentrism Political correctness Black (people) White supremacy Racism in the United States Hate speech Social rule Bowling for Columbine Christianity and anti-Semitism Fundamentalism Internet troll Abortion debate Media and ethnicity Anti-Defamation League Intelligent design movement Asian fetish White nationalism Ethics Sambo (ethnic slur) Supremacism Classified information Nationalism Milton H.

dining out and loo trips i tend to avoid loo trips during meals although when they last a long time and there's a lot of wine flowing this isn't always possible so i dissappear between courses where possible any other tips for timing visits always a difficult one but between courses is ok but sometimes the interval is quite short i made the mistake once of excusing myself from the table for the toilet having not noticed that a lady had a few seconds before quietly left the room she used the downstairs toilet and i went upstairs we both appeared back together after about minutes and when my wife and i got home we had a great big row as she thought that we had been in the toilet together having some nookey i tried to explain but she as women don't would not listen and i spent the night in a spare room the women's husband also had the same thoughts and i subsequently found out that they had a similar confrontation when my wife phoned the hostess the following day to thank her for the evening she casually asked about the existence of the two toilets and was put right and all was forgiven the women's husband did not make such a phone call but phoned me instead to confront me with his knowledge i put him on to my wife and she explained to him the toilet arrangements at that house all blew over but that other couple were divorced two years later  Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Shining (film) The Inside Social rule The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe EastEnders Toilet Ocean's Twelve Rent (musical) Plame affair Time Out of Mind Dead Like Me Friends Blood on the Tracks World War Three (Doctor Who) Sin City Harrow School Episodes of Lost (Season 1) About a Boy What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

why are people so rude most of the time they are very selfish and do what they want to do and say that is the rebellion that has manifested since adam and eve sinned in the garden of eden also parents have not taught their children to be polite and respectful to others and some have not been taught that themselves so how can they teach that which they do not do themselves also the bible says that in the last days mens conscious will be seared which means people will do what they want to do and it not bother their conscious thinking that it is okay  Adam and Eve Original sin Satan Genesis Richard Dawkins Sin Evil Garden of Eden Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Paradise Lost John the Baptist Endowment (Mormonism) Tree of Knowledge The Fall of Man Justification (theology) Adam-God theory Theosis Erich Fromm Satanism Grimke Sisters The Amber Spyglass Religion and sexuality Creationism Children of Eden Tree of Life Abrahamic religion Fallen angel Day-Age Creationism Repentance Gnosticism Urantia Angel Meister Eckhart Moral Politics A Course In Miracles Jewish principles of faith Prophet Young Earth creationism Divine grace Covenant Theology Sant Thakar Singh Entheogen Book of Mormon Origen Apocalyptic literature Predestination Virgin Mary in Islam Ten Commandments God Conservative Judaism Theodicy Cain Charles Grandison Finney Sears Holdings Corporation Church of Christ Confucianism John Wycliffe Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Demon Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Objectivist philosophy Excommunication Baptism Soul Apocrypha Hell Hindu philosophy Heaven Mary, the mother of Jesus Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Gospel of John Book of Isaiah Seventh-day Adventist Church River Out Of Eden Lucas Cranach the Elder Church of Christ, Scientist Lucifer Michael (archangel) Rosicrucian Fellowship Alan Campbell (pastor) Altruism The Garden of Earthly Delights Christian Identity Jesus Vegetarianism and religion Trinity Israel ben Eliezer Calvinism Religion Philo Confucius Criticism of Mormonism Brahman Christian views of women John Howard Yoder

can you complain about people upstairs making too much noise during sex i live alone in my apatment and the couple upstairs have sex almost every day night and each time i can hear the bed making that creeking noise loudly its so disturbing to hear and its really embaressing when i have guests over am i able to complain to the office about it can i do anything about it i want it to stop i cant live here any longe if i have to hear that noise every night btw i had a really hard time picking a category so sorry if its wrong i know i cant stop people fom having sex but perhaps i can get them to try and find a way of having sex that does not involve other people hearing it it isnt my business i dont want to hear it your first approach should be to the upstairs tenants in this particular case it might be more sensitive to do this with a well penned note through their door i would make it matter of fact i would not be specific at this moment in time as to the nature of the disturbance just mention the times that the noise became an invasive annoyance in your apartment they will know what you are talking about without you having to sound as though you are a pervert listening to private moments or not so private at the moment if you do not get any feedback then it is time to go to the caretaker or whoever looks after the building or even the building management company but you have to bear in mind that this could go one of two ways if they are the sort of people who glory in letting everyone know what they are up to they could very well increase the activity and the volume but i hope for your sake that they are just a little bit unaware of how enthusiatic they sounding and will want their private life to return to just that i do wish you well it is an uncomfortable position to be in in the meantime turn up the volume on your tv radio and buy some ear plugs  Social rule A Day in the Life Sin City Hearing impairment Friends The Shining (film) Avenue Q Headphones Hearing aid Strap-on dildo The Inside The Star Wars Holiday Special Music Infantilism Surveillance Jam (TV series) The Dalek Invasion of Earth Milton H.

why are some jobs tip worthy we all pretty much understand servers bartenders and cabbies expect tips in order to make a living since the employer is not required to pay them minimum wage i was shocked and appalled when i went to purchase a cell phone charger and there was a tip jar on the counter i'm sure these people make at least minimum wage any thoughts i agree we have been socialized to find it acceptable to tip for some jobs services and not others having sold women's shoes in high school waited tables and bartended i can say that for the most part bartending was the easiest for me dealing with what we called pretty woman syndrome where ladies would come in try on five pairs of shoes and then walk out is far more taxing than making an old fashioned or a martini some jobs simply pay less even though the service provided is more intensive  Tip Minimum wage Waiter Supply and demand GED Inflation Insurance Economic inequality Poker jargon Microeconomics Blackjack Bartender Keynesian economics Wal-Mart Electronic commerce Betting (poker) Capitalism Internet fraud Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Annuity Efficiency wages Trade union Monopsony Social Security (United States) Mach kernel Shaggy dog story Contract bridge Unemployment New Deal Filling station Economics Life insurance Gross domestic product Labor-power Exploitation Compensation of employees RuneScape quests Asperger syndrome Graduate school Game programmer Flat tax Shoe Unemployment types Columbine High School massacre Labor theory of value Medicare (Canada) Taxicab Culture of the United States Divorce Baccarat Domain Name System Affirmative action Andy Warhol Say's law About a Boy Plame affair Badminton Immigration to the United States Surveillance Education in the People's Republic of China Barbara Boxer Unemployment benefit Volleyball Moe Szyslak Tax Value added tax Battery (electricity) Spam (electronic) Tenshinhan Deflation (economics) Craps Pretty Good Privacy The Sims 2: University Contract Martini cocktail Free market Social aspects of clothing James Bulger Externality Nike, Inc.

do you think it is proper for a bother to give his sister a dozen red roses because she is going to a prom if she has a boyfriend that she has been dating for around years why or why do you think a brother should give her flowers at all if she is going to prom if so what kind i don't have a problem with roses i just don't think a brother should be giving his sister red roses get any other color of rose but not red if a brother wants to give flowers to his sister i think it would be better to get a nice spring mix or something like that no it is not proper for a brother to give his sister red roses however many people don't know this and i wouldn't assume anything freaky based on this alone it's just a breach of etiquette a white or yellow rose maybe or like you said a spring mix i honestly don't think flowers are appropriate anyway perhaps something less associated with romance or intimacy  Rose Guns N' Roses Tournament of Roses Parade Flower Friends The Ashlee Simpson Show Olivia Newton-John Anne Boleyn Wars of the Roses W.I.T.C.H.

why do sales assistants interrupt me while shopping every time i walk in a shop nowadays i'm accosted by sales assistants almost as soon as i enter the shop asking if i have found what i'm looking for to which my usual response is either 'no i wanted to find a shop where i wasn't annoyed by sales assistants' or 'how do i know i haven't had a chance to look yet' followed by me turning straight around and walking out of the shop frustrated the whole experience ruining my shopping experience most of the time they are working on commission but why make it so obvious the rest of the time it is just to make up a score for their mystery shopper survey when will company management realise that the worst thing you can do is interrupt a shopper or even worse a diner who has a mouthful of food sorry to clear up the confusion the guys in places like electrical and mobile phone stores are the ones on comission not all sales assistants btw hope this reaches someone in the management departments of stores and restaurants and those research agencies that run mystery shopper surveys i used to work in retail and i hated that i always had to bug customers but i felt a lot of pressure from my managers if there were people in the store and you were not talking to them then you were not doing your job and you were seen as lazy at the registers they calculate things like average dollar which is the average price per item paid by customers stores generally want this number to be high so they pressure you to 'upsell' meaning they want every customer to leave with not just a pair of pants or a shirt but accessories and shoes to go along with it another issue was getting hours on the schedule it's not always commission that's the motivating factor the workers who consistently did better in sales got the most hours so there was a little competition there trust me most of the salespeople that bother you probably realize you don't want to be bothered and they hate it just as much as you do  Retailer The Apprentice 2 Sears Holdings Corporation Little Britain Bulk vending Milton H.

how do you tell the difference between an awkward silence and a comfortable one well it's kind of hard to explain i guess it depends on the situation you are in when there is an awkward silence i feel strange do you ever have guests over and they sit with everybody just talking well sometimes there is nothing to talk about and everything goes quiet it always feels awkward to me i can't really explain what comfortable silences are like i guess it's just when everything is silent and it feels good to be quiet for a while or maybe everybody is doing there own little thing or in their own little world that nobody talks 'cause they get so caught up into things sometimes you just feel ok and don't notice the silence when i am in comfortable silences i am doing something or just sitting and it feels good not awkward or strange when i am in awkward silences everybody is doing nothing and it's all quiet and you really notice it that it feels weird sorry if my info didn't help i don't explain things very well but if i did help i am glad i could help good luck finding a good answer  Social rule The Silence (The Twilight Zone) Shaggy dog story The Amber Spyglass Theory of conduct Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The nature of God in Western theology Milton H.

tell lifeguard when ppl drink at the beach i know that it is illegal for people to drink on a public beach and sometimes you will see a person sneak some once in a while i normally dont mind as long as they aren't being rowdy but the other day i saw a couple with a cooler who were sneaking vodka and other spirits into their soda cans while their kids were around it was a very quiet beach and they were getting loud and silly while the kids were running around unsupervised the lifeguard seemed to want to say something but didnt after a while they were clearly intoxicated and i approached the lifeguard mentioning i had seen them slip stuff into their sodas he said he would talk to them but all he said was that they had to keep it down without mentioning the alcohol the lifeguard was a teenager in the future what can i do about this if you drink on the beach and you are rowdy you are disturbing other people's good time yes you should tell the lifeguard everything and its the lifeguards decision whether to bring up alcohol or not i don't mind if people drink just to cool down and relax just be respectful towards the people around you  Alcoholic beverage Drowning Swimming pool The Catcher in the Rye Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Vodka Social rule Cocktail Driving under the influence Ripped Pants Mothers Against Drunk Driving Drink Ctrl Alt Del (webcomic) Lifeguard The Beach Boys Beaches of Hong Kong Alcoholism Insomnia Drunk driving (United States) Sauna Codename: Kids Next Door Ocean Beach, New York Camp Lazlo Hyperthermia Caffeine Mountain Dew Trailer Park Boys Wine French cuisine Humphrey Bogart Drunkenness Red Bull The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Coffeehouse Long Island Iced Tea Distilled beverage Radiohead Swimming Polyethylene terephthalate Squidward Tentacles Alcohol Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sunset Beach (soap opera) Sin City Stewie Griffin Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Coca-Cola About a Boy Moonshine Fecal incontinence Archie Comics Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Teen Girl Squad Straight edge Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Jennings Randolph Lake Jack Kerouac Characters in Bleach series USS Tigrone (SS-419) Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!

do you rsvp when the invitation requires it or do you just show up i have noticed that in my wedding and also at another party i am throwing people don't rsvp and then show up or people that rsvp don't even show up as soon as i receive an invitation i rsvp i wish more people would do it by e mail because this is the most convenient for many people now when i plan a party i usually expect half the people who did not rsvp to just show up if i know them well i will call them to see if they are coming and give them a hard time for not rsvping parties are expensive and getting an accurate head count is essential for some events therefore just showing up is extremely rude and inconsiderate  Craps Social rule Request for Comments Census The nature of God in Western theology Volleyball Evite Blackjack Second Vatican Council The Daily Show Integrated services Proportional representation Canadian federal election, 1993 U.S. Electoral College Appeal Political campaign Mixed martial arts Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Hard disk Surveillance Gmail Cultural Revolution Fast bowling Roman currency Internet Group Management Protocol Aerial (dance move) Probability Ron and Fez Theory of conduct United Kingdom general election, 2005 Digital photography Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Health insurance Marriage Skateboarding trick Insurance Indian general elections, 2004 RuneScape skills I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Mattress Poker jargon Motion picture rating system Four square We Belong Together Stopping e-mail abuse Voting system Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus A Milhouse Divided 1957 World Series Paul Martin Advance fee fraud Coin flipping Social Security (United States) The McGuire Sisters Beer Pong Mad Money Leasehold estate Air navigation Liberal Party of Canada leadership convention, 1968 ELO rating system Saturday Night Live The Marriage of Figaro Microeconomics Mail Mixtape Falsifiability Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Contract bridge IP address Damien (South Park episode) The Rocky Horror Picture Show Jewish services Analog-to-digital converter Piccolo Junior Saga The Championships, Wimbledon Mormon missionary Electrophysiology Martial art Baseball Contract Patrick Hillery Rugby league positions Binoculars Crossword Kurdish people Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Kasparov versus The World Gross domestic product 24 (television) Conservative Party (UK) Maya calendar Play party (BDSM) HIV test Late Night with Conan O'Brien 1986 National League Championship Series Spanish transition to democracy Tag

what is wrong with me shouldn't i feel happier at i m a college student yrs old and i dont do anything i went to college hours away when i come home my friends here don t make an effort to hang out we keep in touch it's not the same they re all busy with their own lives we ll grab lunch or something but it s not like we re in each other s present lives in high school i was more social then college i don t have a group of friends the only true friend i have is my boyfriend for a year and a half college i have acquaintances not any true friends i come home for a weekend and do nothing social at college i do the same thing other than class i ve joined student clubs and made acquaintances and that's all my family is the same way they used to be involved in my life but now they are all obsessed with my year old sister i don t want to stay in my hometown forever living in the past i wanna move to a city but i just feel like something is missing in my life is this just growing up what should i do my boyfriend goes to the same college only he is minutes away from home i decided to stay there this summer and work it was really lonely because i don't really feel like i have alot of true friends there he's pretty much it as far as a true friend goes as far as my other friends from high school we have distanced they aren't part of my everyday life anymore i feel like the only person im truly close to is my boyfriend when i do hang out with my other friends he gets kinda jealous especially if i go out to a party or if there are guys there which is understandable so i dont go he always does hang out with me he seems to think i dont make an effort to hang out with friends because he has no problem keeping his friends i did alot of complaining because i do feel lonely alot i feel like he still has all of his friends from high school to hang out with because he's close to home and i dont have that anymore i feel so lonely i think you should move to a bigger city as soon as possible i think that's what you need a city's vibrancy will make you feel more alive the resources available will help you get out and explore more and that is very true it worked for me i knew how it felt when i was in sleepy towns if yours is one it was peaceful but it was also a bit depressing certainly dont make your boyfriend the only person you can turn to this puts a ton of pressure on him work towards cultivating friendships with people you have a good vibe with jealousy is understandable but you shouldnt be limiting ur social life just so he doesnt get jealous i dont think that is healthy also why not visit friends together and have you met his friends most of the times one gets to expand their social circle by including bf's friends in our circle get to know his friends better one thing i do wanna say not everyone can be your good friend so it is okay if there are not many people u can really feel close to also people can outgrow each other and friendships arent the same anymore also it takes time to develop deeper friendships first see what vibe u get from a person do u have any friend who u know likes u and would like to hang out why not take it further visit with them call them a lil more often to see how they are doing give them a lil present ask them deeper questions instead of superficial ones get involved in their lives make them feel special when you give out love you are more likely to be in a position where you will receive love too but for this to happen you also need to take some risks and be in a lil vulnerable position and be ready to take a no always conduct yourself with thoughtfulness and sensitivity to others too i wish you all the best this is surely part of growing up you will realize with time that friend or no friend whether they come or go and they will you have to be your own best friend and be comfy in your own skin  The Emancipation of Mimi Kodocha Friends Humphrey Bogart Social rule EastEnders Cliff Richard Avenue Q Theory of conduct The O.C.

is it an example of bad etiquette to comment on a woman's pregnancy without being certain she is pregnant okay my sister got me a cute top for my birthday it's one of those with the high waist and is a little fuller at the bottom i think it might be an empire waist but i'm no fashion guru now i don't have a bad body or anything but with those particular styles if you don't have a body like mischa barton or paris hilton you can end up looking pregnant anyway my sons and i were at the supermarket this morning and the lady at the checkout line asked me if this next baby is a boy too i just kind of mumbled that i am not pregnant and she just went on about her business without even an i'm sorry was she rude in saying it to begin with then not apologizing or am i justified in being if not angry a little miffed p s the top is either going in the trash being donated or if any of you happen to have the figure for it you can have it for all i care if it's a child that's a whole other story kids will say those kinds of things i'm referring to adults in my opinion she made a bigger arse out of herself by not apologizing no i would not feel like this if i were pregnant it would mean i looked fat for a reason and what about people who are having trouble having children can you imagine what it would be like to be going through fertility treatments and stuff wear one of those blouses one day and have people asking about your pregnancy avie thanks by cute top i really meant the top looked really adorable on the hanger on me not so much lol it was rude hugely rude not only should one be sure before one says sanything one should wait for the pregnant person to announce the pregnancy themselves before acknowledging it  Pregnancy Knots Landing Abortion debate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friends Cytomegalovirus Humphrey Bogart AFI 100 Years series Buttocks Shaggy dog story Jennifer Lopez Breastfeeding Social rule Tightlacing Care Bears Sharon Tate Madonna (entertainer) Laura Schlessinger Kyle Broflovski What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

i was in the grocery store and i had one more item that i had to go past the checkout line to get i angled my cart to the line quickly took the needed or steps and briefly disappeared up the aisle for no more than seconds when i got back to my cart my dreaded fear had been realized as a woman standing behind her cart was now positioned rt behind the line but w a buffer space to the cart in front of her that left me unsure if she was going to recognize my position we both had a fairly equal amount of groceries not too big not too small the moment the line moved i stood motionless prepared to make eye contact and willing to cede the place in line to her but she kept her gaze away f me so i pushed my cart into the line and nothing was said my ques is this what's the protocol about my actions as they relate to position in the line certainly i would be offended if someone stuck their cart in my long line were gone for min and came back w an armload of groceries just in time to be checked out who's gonna push that cart forward when the line moves i know if i was her i would have had no problem letting me take the position that my cart represented unless the line moved and there was no one to push it that's what the protocol should be if it's not plus if there would have been someone in the line behind me i could have mentioned that i would be rt back as i had one item to get that i had forgotten i don't think this was even an issue to the woman in the line she knew i was in front of her why do some ppl think this is a big deal to me is it because i was careful to describe it in detail this is as trivial as it gets but that doesn't mean that i shouldn't be curious about the protocol since most of you have don't have any idea about this i'm gonna stick w the notion that i havn't committed a violation in ethical behavior provided i'm there to move my cart forward when the line moves if i was shopping w someone they could watch the cart if someone was behind me i could ask them to excuse me while i quickly get one more item i leave the cart at the end of the aisle when i shop instead of pushing it everywhere i go i get the items in that aisle then proceed this time i left the cart at the end of the line because there was no reason cluttering up the store unnecessarily nas i took the final sec to get the last item so there that settles it leave your cart in line if you can get back to it before the line moves lol let me ask you this what if you are in line and there is someone behind you you don't say anything dash off for sec return w one item only to discover the person behind you swapped places and the line hasn't even moved would you feel violated by this you're lying if you say no i would agree with you if you were just gone so briefly that the cashier had not gotten to your place i would have procedded as you did it seems you tried to make eye contact perhaps at your return to the cart just saying thanks if just had to grab something quickly however if the person wouldn't even look at you what's a person to do no big deal it's nice that you considered other's feelings  Theory of conduct Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story Friends Surveillance Theodicy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.

do people not know they have to tip or even tip correctly im a great server but people come in sometimes and do not tip the right amount which is of the whole bill like today i had a table they were pretty nice their bill was dollars they tipped me yes a smiley face thats what they wrote on their slip who are these peopel i give speedy and friendly service been serving for years and people should definitely tip because the servers have to tip out according to their sales to the bussers bartenders runners etc if they dont tip the servers are walking out with gas money i hate when people say they dont have to tip yes you do if you dont then you mind as well call yourself a cheap o and dont go out to eat or you can go out but serve yourself go to buffets ugh sorry i just did not like some of the responses below oh and the smiley face table i was good with them because they complimented me but then again they didnt really speak english very well responde to aussie yeah you dont have to tip i guess but your attitude suggests you have no compassin let alone a heart for those who make a living out of serving and most if not all servers are students so i do go to school please die tomorrow thanks let me start off by saying that i always try and tip what i can and if the serve did an exceptional job i'd leave a better tip in fact i feel guilty if i don't leave one here's the thing some people have never worked as a server or in the restaurant retail world their ignorance tells them well the food cost us so much so why should we have to give more it's all about putting yourself in the other person's shoes which those type of people do not it's ironic but i usually find that the people that have less money and were not raised ultra privileged give more some take things too personal and think well i didn't get a rd refill so no tip for him her these people just realized that it's a human being that is helping them and people make mistakes on the other hand as long as you tried your best the majority of people will recognize this and tip it's a possibility that those people with the bill forgot to tip hey it happens believe me people know that if it's a sit down restaurant you are supposed to tip out of courtesy but of course it's not required i always try to give a little over myself hey best of luck and don't take it personal did i get the best answer chris k  Social rule Theory of conduct Little Britain Tip The Apprentice 2 Singlish Whose Line Is It Anyway?

a homeless man asked for change but i didn't have any so i gave him some pizza hut coupons was that wrong as i see it there are three very different types of panhandlers the first is the person who absolutely does not want to be homeless but who has been forced to that state by an unfortunate set of circumstances they often will not beg but will look for resources that may help them back onto their own feet such a person should not be offended by any offer of help including a food coupon then there are the many who actually should be in a mental institution many were once institutionalized but have been forced into the streets by our health care system these are the somewhat scary people who rant or talk to themselves their's is a sad situation but they are also very vulnerable to alcohol and drugs i think its best to not give them money and enable their destructive forces a food coupon would be better finally there's the group who simply prefer the homeless lifestyle they simply prefer not to work or take any kind of responsibility easier to beg and let life's circumstances control them than to take control for themselves my sympathy tends to be least for these though some are such humorous characters and harmless that one may occasionally feel like giving them a bit of change but they too are vulnerable to drugs and alcohol so a food coupon might be better for them even if it isn't what they would prefer i think you did a fine thing  Homelessness Begging Borderline personality disorder Hypoglycemia Health care in the United States Human sexual behavior Avenue Q Drug abuse Sant Thakar Singh Theory of conduct Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Abortion debate Pacifism Sexual orientation Health insurance Autism rights movement Rape Alcoholics Anonymous Infantilism Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shaggy dog story Libertarianism Bond American Psycho Ex-gay Ethics Knots Landing Mojave people Involuntary commitment Probation officer Social rule Word of Wisdom Breastfeeding Cancer Pitaten Meditation Alcoholism Child sexual abuse Fixed income Addiction Charles Ponzi Controlled Substances Act Kodocha Drug test Illegal drug trade Theodicy Information warfare Social work A Course In Miracles Trimurti Clinical depression Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Paternalism Peter Griffin Philosophical skepticism Drama Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sant Mat Goodness and value theory Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Meaning of life Badly Drawn Kitties Little Britain Computer virus Prostate cancer Abortion Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ontological argument Scientology and psychiatry Transactional analysis Poverty Schapelle Corby Floppy disk Viz (comic) Humphrey Bogart Rationing Eucharist Pedophilia Michael Garibaldi The Smoking Room PaX Mental Health Act 1983 Friedrich Schleiermacher Springfield Elementary School Organic farming Plame affair Mothers Against Drunk Driving Polyamory Pizza Hut Hey Jude A Series of Unfortunate Events Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Friends Fast bowling National Institutes of Health Aesthetic Realism Motion picture rating system Arguments for and against drug prohibition Value system Trafficking in human beings

why do some people honk at people in their yards when they drive by i'm not talking about friends trying to get your attention or guys honking at you because they think you are good looking i'm talking about some folks who just honk at anybody it is so annoying and strange don't you think what is the rationale personally i find it to be very rude they are not honking to warn kids or pets i am alone working in my yard pretty far back from the road i find that the honkers are usually pickup trucks with teenagers or construction workers of all ages when they honk it actually startles me that is why i don't like it my dh will do this sometimes when he is in a goofy mood sometimes we just have to take it easy and not worry about the little things in life relax and wave back even if it is teenagers who were trying to get your goat you will not be giving them what they want anger so relax and wave back  Doug The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Social rule Shaggy dog story The Fairly OddParents KaBlam!

why arent people more friendly towards one another people can be so rude when they drive cutting people off and no one really smiles at each other or looks each other in the eye why is that if you are planning on being a smart dont even bother people are insecure in who they are and we generally carry our baggage on our backs during the day not thinking or considering the other person we are so into ourselves we don't see one another so if we each just gave minutes to smiling a day until it became a habit then we would start being better where are we going in such a hurry that we cut each other off nowhere we need experiences that will make us stop and slow down  Social rule Eye contact Current teachings of Prem Rawat Kender The Marshall Mathers LP The Smoking Room Kodocha Shaggy dog story Cliff Richard Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Parkway Drive Surveillance Yoko Ono Super Bowl XXI The Midnight Sun The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Alcoholics Anonymous Apollo 15 Kim Possible: So the Drama Battles of Lexington and Concord Simplified molecular input line entry specification Tunisia Campaign Erwin Rommel Jon Secada Rodney McKay Cho Hakkai Hall & Oates 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Amber Spyglass Fecal incontinence Have I Got News For You Time Out of Mind Anger management Saga (band) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Mercury Atlas 6 Aerial (dance move) Father's Day (Doctor Who) Dead Like Me Toyota Prius Tsukihime Andr__s Galarraga K' Final Fantasy magic Humphrey Bogart Community Patrick Star Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Jackass: The Movie VIA Rail Initial D DaimlerChrysler smart 1898 invasion of Guant__namo Bay Chu-Han contention Russian joke Knots Landing Beavis and Butt-head Darwin from Insectivorous plants to Worms Blonde on Blonde Opus Dei Jennifer Lopez Get Smart Pope John Paul I 2002 Gujarat violence 11001001 (TNG episode) The Curse of Fenric The Death Gate Cycle Grand Theft Auto (game) Attachment theory Sin City The Emancipation of Mimi X-Men: Evolution Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Milton H.

i need help making small talk with people i'm horrible at it i always have trouble talking to people other than my friends and family when i meet new people at school and stuff i have no idea what to talk about my mind seems to go blank and no topics worth disscussing come to mind i need help so i can actually hold a conversation so if you could help me out that would be great p s i'm bty the best way to hold a conversation is to ask questions for example where do you go to school where are you from do you play any sports ask about them and then jump in with a short story or mention your interest when you find a similar interest sometimes it is even ok to tell someone that you don't have a similar interest for example oh you play baseball i've never really been a big fan but i guess it's different when you're playing this opens up the conversation to their experience and will continue the conversation hope this helps  Social rule The Catcher in the Rye The nature of God in Western theology Wheel of Fortune Fight Club Major League Baseball television contracts Game show Theory of conduct Plame affair Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Francis Crick Married... with Children G-Man (Half-Life) Turing test David Hume Jiddu Krishnamurti You Don't Know Jack Little Britain Poker jargon John Cage Garth Brooks Kodocha The writing of Principia Mathematica Discworld Social psychology C.

how do you start smoking this is going to be a strange question but how do you start smoking i don't smoke nor do i ever plan to start but i'm writing a story where someone is starting and he's getting pointers from someone else on how to do it without choking to death or throwing up any ideas on what i could have the character do one thing you could do is have the learning character being caught not inhaling the smoke just taking a drag but keeping it in their mouth this is easy to spot on beginners because instead of a stream of smoke coming out of the mouth it is a puff that comes out all at once people who spot this usually find it funny because it is obvious that the person is a newbie on it other than that just breathing in the smoke is the right way it chokes and hurts the first few times but not much after no throwing up unless the smoke goes in your stomach hopefully the character in the story is going to learn that smoking is a stupid thing to do  Bong Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fire fighting Social rule Cancer of the larynx Shaggy dog story Professional wrestling holds Drowning Breaststroke Aerial (dance move) Cigarette Smoking Man Spidey Super Stories Theory of conduct Newbie Pneumonia Mojave people Magic (illusion) Sub-Zero Diving Noob Saibot Professional wrestling throws Breastfeeding Smoking pipe Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels The Amber Spyglass Salad Fingers Milton H.

why do you have to be barefoot to enter the white house i recently read online that all persons guests employees etc must be barefoot while inside the white house i know the custom of taking off one's shoes in japan but why did the white house institute this barefoot policy perhaps it was instigated to prevent explosives to be brought in hidden in shoes you are required to remove shoes at airports the reason for no socks is more difficult to understand it may have to do with cheney his immune system is compromised because of all his heart problems and medication and it's possible that antrax spores could be imbedded in the material in peoples socks if slick willie was still there it would be easy to figure out he would be looking at women's feet and getting aroused i read that monica lewinskys feet really turned him on  Barefoot Shoe Bill Clinton High-heeled shoe Monica Lewinsky Foot Customs and etiquette of Japan Surveillance Sento Climbing equipment Sock Hillary Rodham Clinton Gaia Online Social aspects of clothing Blackjack Lewinsky scandal Shoe size Foot odor Digital rights management Skateboarding trick Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Japanese tea ceremony Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Public health in mainland China Fast bowling Volleyball Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hiking Abortion Plame affair Land mine U.S. Electoral College Nike, Inc.

i dont like eating in front of people especially guys and i need to get over it how i dont understand why no i do not have a eating disorder i am years old its a mental thing you'll have to overcome it yourself with time just realize that the fear is something your mind made up on it's own but you should also realize that you have full control over it and you can reverse it just remove your self consciousness from yourself when you eat everyone eats so do not worry about what others think of you when you are eating because they probably are thinking nothing of it at all again it's all in your mind good luck  Psychoanalysis Eating disorder Binge eating disorder Buddhism Obsessive-compulsive disorder Magical thinking Anorexia nervosa Sigmund Freud Mind Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Insomnia Psychosis Children of Dune Unconscious mind Metaphysics Mind control Borderline personality disorder Billboard (advertising) Friedrich Schleiermacher Psychotherapy Person Philosophy of mind Patrick Star Ontological argument The nature of God in Western theology Panic attack Meme Procrastination Cultural relativism Milton H.

i am a waitress ane one thing i have trouble with is how to tell a guest to control their child help as a mother i'm compelled to answer sometimes it is not easy to control a child in public some kids are good in public some are not some children act out in public to get attention why who knows it just happens more than likely the child is like that at home then there are some parents who let their child be like that you can never tell maybe they have a disorder or condition that makes them act out you have to take in account that it's not entirely the parents fault my middle son for example is autisic it is a neurological disorder it is something i cannot control for instance i was at a resturant with my child and family and he cried and yelled because he didn't want to sit down i was about in tears there's nothing i could have done i tried giving him toys crayons and paper nothing worked until the food came then he calmed down i'm sure those parents you speak of was embarrassed and upset talk to your boss ask him what you should do don't just take it into your own hands you very well could have an angry parent in your face and without a job  Friends Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Asperger syndrome Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Little Britain Rain Man The Critic Kodocha Breastfeeding Social rule Milton H.

what do you think of having a drivers ed for bike riding but its free i see so many people riding on the wrong sides of the road toward traffic and not following what we know as the rules maybe if someone taught a class to tell us what the right rules were then maybe everyone would be lots safer and they'd give you a bike license like a drivers license but it states that you been to that class classes and its safe for you to be on the road year olds won't have to go they'll have an age where you have to do it that would certainly help but i think that we can provide better training for car drivers as well i live in a city with a lot of cyclists and most of them know the rules of the road i see many more drivers being rude to them hogging the road or breaking traffic laws than cyclists  Bike lane debate Vehicular cycling Driver's license Rules of the road Critical Mass Segregated cycle facilities Bicycle Bicycle helmet Effective Cycling Utility cycling Cycling Transportation of Los Angeles Motorcycle Road traffic accident Freeway Cycle path debate Hitchhiking Road safety Bicycle lighting Mountain biking Recumbent bicycle Traffic calming Traffic Sport utility vehicle Road bicycle racing Sustrans Tour de France Union Cycliste Internationale Speed limit Automobile Traffic light Cycling in Melbourne Tom Simpson Motorway Grand Theft Auto (game) Jaywalking Seat belt legislation Automatic number plate recognition Bus rapid transit Cycling team Lane Lance Armstrong Light rail Racing bicycle Roundabout Transport in Hong Kong Road School bus Track cycling Level crossing Public transport Trail Drunk driving (United States) Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China Drag racing Park and ride Vehicle registration plate Bicycle-friendly Curb extension Hour record Eddy Merckx Honda Highway Dual carriageway West Side Highway High-occupancy vehicle Hubert Opperman Boston transportation United States Grand Prix Road-rule enforcement camera Rail transport in Ireland Mario Cipollini TGV Formula One Cyclo-cross Stephen Roche Texas State Highway Loop 360 Tamar Bridge Graeme Obree Toyota Prius Chris Boardman Individual time trial Single-speed bicycle Personal rapid transit Car safety Star Wars: Battlefront Sutton Park Interstate Highway Pulaski Skyway Street Climbing specialist (cycling) London Congestion Charge Zebra crossing Hillclimbing REAL ID Act Car and Driver King City, Ontario Universal Serial Bus Group B

how do i deal with a younger supervisor i've just recently started working for a fitness company would rather not mention the name i don't have an issue with the operations manager however her assistant is the problem she seems to have an issue with me upon filling out my new hire paperwork she became frustrated with me as i was taking my time filling out my tax information i wanted to be sure everything was filled out correctly as it is my money and my paycheck she grew furious because she was off at pm and it was now pm when i reached the pertinent information she kept pressuring me to hurry up she was rude to me and demeaning to me in front of other customers and co workers i am years old she's and the assistant manager now i realize age isn't the issue but the fact that she's younger than i am and higher up i think she feels she can belittle me anyway i told the manager about her behavior and how i'm not willing to tolerate it on a daily basis i'm not the only one to complain about it so my question is how do i deal with her because now that i've complained to my boss about her she's gone and told the manager that i arrive at work late i'm never on time and yada yada yada which isn't true i'm always minutes early and i work full time this is only my part time evening job what do i do to deal with this issue it's obvious my manager is not going to handle the situation so how can i continue to deal with her on a day to day basis any suggestions i feel that because shey's younger and higher up she has gotten this very big ego over it and now thinks she's tough s another thing that made me angry was that she insisted on filling out my direct deposit information assuming i didn't know how it's gotten to the point to where i have to hunt her down when i get to work to let her know i'm at work so she doesn't march over to my manager and lie and tell her i came in late and on top of that i have to clock in why can't she just leave me alone and focus on her job the way clocking in works it doesn't matter when you clock in you'll be clocked in for the time you are supposed to start to the time you are to stop working i was told by my manager if i was minutes late and i clocked in it would still be for the time i was supposed to start and end either way they don't know if i'm late or not which is poor disorganization on the companies' behalf not my fault however there's no way for my manager to know i come into work minutes early regardless because her assistant manager who seems to despise me for some reason keeps telling her i come in late it's no fixing it i like this job and would like to keep it it's only something i do to keep busy because i do make good money with my fulltime job why can't she just mind her own business grow up and do her job to start age and maturity will always be an issue at any job if you are treated unfairly and in front of people document it and bring it to the hr of the company do not neccesarily go directly to your manager the next thing is you clock in system is messed up you should be paid for the time your there that you should be rewarded for coming in early because why come in early if people are being rewarded or not being docked for coming in late my suggestion since this is a part time job move on if it was a full time i would say other wise i have been going through a situation lately with a team lead that i am currently more qualified unfortunately life isn't always fair but if you work hard and stick up for yourself you will be ok just make sure you do not drop to that persons level bring issues up in a professional manner and always document any wrong doings  2000 Australian Grand Prix Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Friends Scientology beliefs and practices Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Economics The Apprentice 2 Characters in the Smurfs Knots Landing Avenue Q K' Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act The Smoking Room Philosophical skepticism Transactional analysis W.

did it ever occur to you you were setting yourself up for frustration by memorizing all th wedding etiquette because probably of your guests and of your wedding party have no idea what wedding etiquette is or how to follow it years after my wedding i realized wedding etiquette made me have expectations i shouldn't have had i should have relaxed and enjoyed things more instead of being huffy and offended at all the people who didn't know the proper manners for weddings overall i still enjoyed my wedding a great deal but i could've enjoyed it even more if i didn't have so many expectations i read about these brides spending times what i did on my wedding and being bridezilla's and all i wonder if later they have these same regrets that's why i m asking the question etiquette exists to smooth relations between people and have an established set of communal rules to work with thereby reducing hurt feelings and easing awkward situations if everyone knew wedding etiquette this would be wonderful however i am finding that more and more no one knows what is proper anymore i had people get offended about something that was totally accepted etiquette because they were very simple country folk who got married in their living room and didn't know any better nothing wrong with that but it's a totally different animal than the traditional white wedding that we had even when someone in the family gently informed them that what we were doing was standard they still found it unusual so i was incredibly frustrated because even though we were right they thought we were jerks it does not make me regret learning and knowing the rules though my approach to the wedding day was to be insanely anal about preparing trying to foresee all the problems and fix them ahead of time but then on the big day relax and let whatever happens just happen good planning can help you to relax because you know you've done what you can i think etiquette is a key part of this and i'd do pretty much everything the same except maybe include a photocopy of a page from emily post in with the unhappy family members' invitation  Etiquette God Emperor of Dune Avenue Q Friends Ethics Mojave people Sauna Social rule Poker jargon Marriage Customs and etiquette of Japan Meal Humphrey Bogart Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Culture shock White wedding Shaggy dog story Chopsticks Religious Society of Friends Wedding ring Manners Extreme Programming Pitaten Transactional analysis Debugging Killian documents Supply and demand Birth control Stuttering EastEnders Series finale Haven (TNG episode) Sailing Blood on the Tracks Fiddler on the Roof Piccolo Junior Saga John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Betting (poker) Plame affair Chess strategy and tactics Internet troll Newbie CPU cache Craps Child sexuality Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The Apprentice 2 Sento Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Saturday Night Live We Belong Together Judith Martin Beavis and Butt-head A Course In Miracles The Damned Scenes from a Memory The Marriage of Figaro The Contender (television series) Asperger syndrome Cliff Richard Lauren Bacall Social aspects of clothing Philosophy of mathematics Forty-seven Ronin Aida (musical) Human sexual behavior The Wedding Present Hikikomori Hiking Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Keynesian economics Chinese tea culture Doomsday argument 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sant Thakar Singh Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Calvin and Hobbes Japanese values Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sexual orientation Pretty Good Privacy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Fecal incontinence Douglas Adams Theodicy On Her Majesty's Secret Service Out-of-body experience StarCraft: Uprising About a Boy The Shining (film) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist

is tipping going too far it seems just about every service known these days expects a tip i went to a fast food restaurant franchise that had a tip jar and this particular restaurant always has bad service is that even allowed can someone break it down for example horseback riding trail leaders dry cleaners bell hops that put your luggage in the cab there've been a few times when i've pondered should i have tipped that guy i think it's gone way too far you're right everyone expects a tip these days especially at the holidays i even get a card taped to my trash cans with my trash collector's name stamped inside so we know who to make the check out to i even had a skycap at the airport tell me no fewer than times in minutes that he works for tips like i've never flown before personally i am sick of it now i tip when i feel like it and when the service rendered deserves it i tip in restaurants when i get good service if i get really crappy service i do not leave a good tip i usually leave something just no the expected remember when it was i do not put in tip jars for a cup of coffee starbucks shoud pay their employees properly while charging that amount for coffee tips means to insure promt proper service if i do not get either it is reflected in the tip i used to bartend and wait tables i worked hard for my tips service staff today need to realize that they can't just show up and get tons of extra in tips they have to earn it i feel that if i feel resentful over leaving a tip then the tip wasn't deserved if i feel happy to leave a tip then the person has earned it  Tip Poker jargon Octopus card Tea Health insurance Coffee Waiter Craps Menstrual cup United States Postal Service Microeconomics Insurance Friends Life insurance Coffeehouse Soldering The Amazing Race Brand Restaurant Draw poker Cannabis cultivation In-N-Out Burger Shaggy dog story Cha chaan teng Futurama (TV series - season 5) Epcot Knife Taxicab Economy of Cuba Dilbert Tenshinhan Betting (poker) Yum cha Copyleft Credit card Mutual fund The Adventures of Pete & Pete The Star Wars Holiday Special Aerial (dance move) Docklands Light Railway Theory of conduct Equine conformation Surveillance Sant Baljit Singh Kill Bill Drill bit Airport Bay Area Rapid Transit First aid The Drew Carey Show Wayne Gretzky RuneScape economy Fast food Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Sandy Koufax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bank Unemployment benefit Condom Radiohead Knots Landing Time Out of Mind Volleyball Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Electrophysiology Public transport American Idiot Procrastination Cuisine of Denmark Champagne (beverage) Wal-Mart Table tennis Ice hockey National Football League Unemployment Days of our Lives Alex Ferguson Saturday Night Live Mnemonic Jon Secada Full Metal Panic?

sailor mouth so it's not okay for a woman to have a sailor mouth but what makes it more acceptable for a man not arousing any gender debate here but just wondering p in society in general women are expected to uphold mannerisms far more than men just for the sake of being lady like but what really is the logic behind it because women are supposed to be gentler nurturing mothers etc i don't mean that in a negative way just trying to guess at the reasoning i know a professional woman who goes to great care to dress stylishly works out gets her hair professionally done carefully applied make up i respected her when i encountered her and assumed she was a classy lady when in a meeting behind closed doors with her subordinates one day i learned that she really has a sailor mouth and i lost all respect for her she didn't need to resort to that kind of language to be effective it just made her seem crass and i don't find it acceptable for a man to do it either and i am actually married to a former sailor i learned some new words when we got married but i try not to use them  Gender role Humphrey Bogart Economic inequality Customs and etiquette of Japan Human sexual behavior Homophobia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Abortion debate Feminism American and British English differences Little Britain Theory of conduct Religious Society of Friends Women in the Victorian era Incest Gender-neutral language Japanese tea ceremony Transsexuality Social rule Milton H.

what is appropriate female attire for a date to sky bar on montrose on a thursday salsa night they have a live band that plays salsa merengue and bachata dress jeans and dressy top sky bar in houston well i happen to know a thing or two about salsa thursdays at sky bar first some general advice in case he's a salsaholic and you're expecting to dance non stop the whole night hair make up hair up and easy on the make up because you will be sweating a lot accessories careful with earrings that dangle they have a tendency to get caught on his shirt and cause you lots of pain as a result clothing make sure that you test whatever top or dress you plan to wear so that nothing pops out in the middle of a double right turn use double sided tape if you feel that popping out is a risk if wearing a dress make sure that it doesn't do a marylin monroe while your turning unless you like the attention shoes wear comfy shoes no spike heels unless you're used to dancing in those also wear something with a smooth sole as rubber soles tend to create more friction with you and the floor and therefore make dancing more difficult if you have dance heels that's your best bet personally i think nice pants a sexy top with a hint of cleavage or a lot depending on the message you're trying to send matching accessories nice comfortable sexy heels will do the trick if he likes you what you wear won't be as important as letting him know that you like him too if he's not a salsaholic and you don't expect to do much dancing but rather sit around sipping margaritas while others have all the fun then you can pretty much wear whatever you want enjoy you should take some salsa lessons while you're at it because dancing salsa is a blast  Shoe Professional wrestling match types Aerial (dance move) Violin Irish dance Music of Puerto Rico Glossary of partner dance terms Fast bowling Social aspects of clothing Characters in the Smurfs Clothing Cello Volleyball Sailing Comanche Skinhead Professional wrestling slang Skateboarding trick Marilyn Monroe Salsa music High-heeled shoe Social rule Kilt Trailer Park Boys Little Britain Ballroom dance Undergarment Suit (clothes) Paul Is Dead Mattress Poker jargon Madonna (entertainer) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Time Out of Mind Sock Strap-on dildo Blackjack Lindy Hop Bob Jones University The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Kimono Humphrey Bogart Beavis and Butt-head Jon Secada The Apprentice 2 Diving suit Punk fashion Badminton Fruits Basket Milton H.

offended because they weren't singled out i tried to ask this question in the shortest form possible but i seriously messed it up here s more of the story two people at my grandparents church got offended because i didn t send them a graduation invitation to their house now yesterday they sent me a graduation present a ring i don't want to thank them after the immature way they acted about not being singled out and there is a good reason they were not singled out no one was i had a terrible battle with depression the whole second semester and i wasn't sure of graduating until about a week before the ceremony itself so sending out personalized invitations to over a people was not an option addressing them would have taken at least or days the mail would have taken another or to get to them leaving at the most days of notification for the whole thing we put up the invitation as soon as we knew so the question i was really getting at was how do i resolve this without airing my dirty laundry that seems unbelievably childish to not want to thank them for a gift and a ring is a nice gift because they were hurt at not being invited personally since it's over your graduation that means you're stepping over into grown up world in grown up world it's best to not hold grudges and act childish in situations like this even if they were ugly about it earlier consider the nice gift they gave you as a way to smooth things over simply write them a thank you note for the ring mentioning that it's a lovely generous gift then let it go if your'e determined to make a stand against the way they acted and i really would not suggest doing so you need to send the ring back not keep it and refuse to thank them for it that is times more rude than how they acted and keep in mind their offended attitudes probably stemmed from a good place they thought you were close so were hurt when they weren't specifically invited they don't need the whole truth but a simple i'm sorry i didn't realize it would hurt or offend you would work nicely here  Pitaten Shaggy dog story Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theodicy Contract Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) Plame affair Royal Assent Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Past teachings of Prem Rawat Jon Secada Negima The Contender (television series) Surveillance Kender Evil The Apprentice 2 Tenshinhan Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Avenue Q Blood on the Tracks Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Socrates 1957 World Series Value system Characters in the Smurfs Current teachings of Prem Rawat Vegeta Time Out of Mind Germaine Greer Hey Jude Justification (theology) Appeal Priesthood (Mormonism) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism I Want to Hold Your Hand Highway 61 Revisited Summa Theologiae Theodore Kaczynski Customs and etiquette of Japan Eddie Guerrero Epistemology Ontological argument Funeral The Catcher in the Rye Panay incident Urantia German grammar Eastern Orthodox Church Expert system The nature of God in Western theology Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Lovely Bones Downing Street memo Oasis (band) Make money fast Scientology beliefs and practices Sharon Tate The Smoking Room Gmail Forgiveness Live 8 Aerial (dance move) The Book of Five Rings Haven (TNG episode) Dispensationalism Child sexual abuse AFI 100 Years series Sydney Riot of 1879 Missouri Compromise Book of Mormon Plame affair timeline Procrastination Ranma __ characters Slow Train Coming Self Portrait Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters EastEnders The Chronicles of Narnia The Inside The Pet Sounds Sessions Meaning of life Kasparov versus The World Futurama (TV series - season 4) Singlish Traumatic incident reduction Smallville (Season 4)

how do you deal with that really nasty b at the office some people might say to kill them with kindness which might work however it could end up frustrating you in the long run b c your niceness isn't reciprocated i would suggest ignoring that person there's nothing you can do to change the way they act so just go about your day as though they don't matter b c in reality they don't matter people are going to act like a holes regardless of how you respond to them it only reflects poorly on them when they act that way i wouldn't bring myself to their level by acting like that in return  Theory of conduct Transactional analysis Philosophical skepticism Poker jargon Prisoner's dilemma Plame affair Theodicy Jumpstart 3rd Grade Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Power (sociology) Milton H.

shower invitation proper wording to let guests know they don't have to pay for themselves so i'm having my sister's baby shower at a restaurant probably in a private area should be about people my plan is to have it at like p m and i will order pay for a selection of appetizers and salads for the group to share as well i will pay for soft drinks how do i word it on the invitation so that people don't think that they have to pay for their own meal or chip in i picked a later time so that people wouldn't think it was dinner i plan on telling the waiters not to give out menus what else can i do to make it clear am i better to have it at like pm to reduce the chance that people would order alcohol i really can't afford to pay for alcohol for everyone people are likely to drink at any time but perhaps p m is a less likely time than after dinner perhaps you can say come enjoy a night of appetizers and refreshments if you are going to provide the food and drink then you are going to have to foot the bill regardles of the price you can't start limiting people during the night or cutting them off at a certain point so perhaps a way around this is to ask the waiter or waitresses to bring x amount of wine to the table however much you want to pay so that people know that what's on the table is what they get any other alcoholic beverages can be billed to the individual people or you can say come enjoy a night of appetizers and refreshments non alcoholic this kind of gets the point across without bieng too abrupt  Korean cuisine Wine Meal Restaurant Cuisine of Denmark French cuisine Soft drink Alcoholic beverage Cha chaan teng Tea Peruvian cuisine Menu Tip Food Knots Landing Hell's Kitchen (television) Roman eating and drinking Coffeehouse Waiter Breakfast Culture of France Jewish cuisine Health insurance Poker jargon Cuisine of Brazil Cuisine of Greece Tea (meal) Sauna Delicatessen Friends Alcohol Customs and etiquette of Japan Expert system President (game) Prohibition Coffee Little Britain British cuisine Sento Arak (liqueur) Beer Social rule In-N-Out Burger Breastfeeding Drink Public house Humphrey Bogart Word of Wisdom Conveyor belt sushi George Brown, Baron George-Brown Shaggy dog story Betting (poker) Slot machine Culture of Ancient Rome Alcoholism Passover Seder Serbian cuisine Craps Dim sum Fast food Public transport Olive Garden Cuisine of Turkey Cafeteria Publicly funded medicine Mothers Against Drunk Driving Food Stamp Program Vodka McDonald's Moonshine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tax Halaal The Apprentice 2 Quesadilla Sukkot Fecal incontinence Supermarket Epcot Blackjack Distilled beverage A&W Restaurants Yum cha Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Life insurance Filling station Mormonism and Judaism The Human Stain Pizza Hut Taxation in the United States Economy of Russia Dinner Rum Ron and Fez Fish and chips Trailer Park Boys The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Las Vegas, Nevada

what would you do if you were me the last time my friends relations came to visit they asked him to collect them from the airport a hour drive from where he lives meaning a hour round trip for him i work about a half hour drive from the airport and make the hour drive to our home town at weekends so i offered to collect the visitors they told me their flight was in at pm but they made a mistake and it wasn't in until almost pm which meant i didnt get home until well after midnight they never apologised for making me wait nor offered me any token of appreciation this trip was an extra hour's drive for me they are coming over again this weekend and have hinted at getting a lift with me again i'd rather get home much earlier on a friday night to go out with my friends and besides i think they were rude so why they hell should i put myself out for them however if i dont collect them my friend will have to do the hr journey as busses stop at pm what would you do just let it be known very simply as soon as possible that you have already made plans for friday night and sorry but you won't be available and furthermore the courtesy is only available in cases of extreme need as you have appointments to keep at the weekend i think you should have a chat with your friend about it because somepeople think that one favour means a lifetime's committment they may not be willing to travel so often if it's not that easy for them or they will have to arrange to get an earlier flight so they can get a bus i got badly caught like this once when a neighbour i didn't know that well asked me for a lift to her work place which was sort of on the way to my job i had to take a minute detour which made me late she turned up on my doorstep the next morning at am just like that and expected the same again except i was on a day off she shouted at me how am i supposed to get to work so i had to put her straight told her my work hours were erratic that i didn't have the same starting time every day and that i didn't mind an emergency but that was it she hasn't spoken to me since  Social rule Sydney Riot of 1879 The Amazing Race The Family from One End Street Ocean's Twelve Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Operation Market Garden Public transport Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Plame affair Norway national football team Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Wheel of Fortune Lee Harvey Oswald Miami-Dade Transit 2003 North America blackout Time Out of Mind James Hanratty Transport in Hong Kong Saturday Night Live 2005 trial of Michael Jackson One Tree Hill (TV series) Dead Like Me EastEnders Paul Morphy 2000 Australian Grand Prix Soap opera Operation Yellow Ribbon Little Britain Meat Loaf Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 San Francisco Municipal Railway Continuation War History of Test cricket (to 1883) Taxicab 24 Hours of Le Mans MTV2 Good Morning, Vietnam 1957 World Series Eddie Guerrero New York Giants Paul Is Dead Mojave people Ben Johnson (athlete) Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge Ayrton Senna Alex Ferguson John Cage Midnight Run Battles of Lexington and Concord Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Machinima The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Utility cycling Incarnations of Immortality Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Oasis (band) The Hitch-Hiker (The Twilight Zone) Rosa Parks Have I Got News For You The Amber Spyglass IBM PC compatible About a Boy The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Indianapolis 500 Pitaten Knots Landing Avenue Q WNNX (FM) Extras (sitcom) She Loves You Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Hey Jude Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Detailed timeline of the assassination of John F.

tipping how much should you tip your hairdresser is there a certain percentage etc that is the norm' im a woman and the place i go to isnt really expensive so it seems odd giving a tip thats almost as much as the haircut yet im not sure if only giving a couple of pounds is slightly rude well in my own experience used to be a hairdresser i could do someones hair colour and cut for around and get around tip however the majority of customers tip and can range from the little old ladies giving you the coppers from their purse to the people who tip in complete honesty though all tips are much apreciated and even is greatly recieved because at the end of the day a tip is a kind gesture to show that the standards have been exceeded in customer care and service quality and you shouldnt feel obliged to tip anyone who hast met your standards  Tip Haircut Clothing The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Strap-on dildo Barber Little Britain Cat Customs and etiquette of Japan Androgen insensitivity syndrome Snooker Internal ballistics Divorce Economy of the Republic of Ireland Broadband Internet access Contract Insurance Health insurance Iditarod Guinea pig Dog Social aspects of clothing Culture of the United States Gender role Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Jewish view of marriage Airsoft Craps Kimono Spark plug Double bass Katana Gramophone record Social rule Service Shaving Illegal drug trade Call girl Network effect Billiards Information Technology Infrastructure Library Salute Telephone exchange Assault rifle Depilation Oral sex Ethics Infantilism Publicly funded medicine Explosive material M16 (rifle) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Relationship marketing Verizon Wireless Szlachta Reliability engineering Gas metal arc welding Welding Condom Nail (anatomy) Kohen Saxophone TLC Efficiency wages British Rail Class 42 Honesty The Critic Kender RuneScape quests Rigour Credit card Screw Social role of hair Price discrimination Education in the People's Republic of China Solar cell Transformer Viva Hate Roman currency Wind turbine Martial Graduate school Beautiful Life Diamond Original Amiga chipset Japanese tea ceremony Vowel Loyalty business model Australian Aboriginal languages Goodness and value theory Diamond cut Piano Asperger syndrome ALGOL 68 Violin Education in the United States Advertising Human sexual behavior

don't you hate it when the waitress seats you near crying whining kids i'm a mom i would never take my kids to a nice restaurant at night if they couldn't behave family restaurants are fair game why would i waste my money and ruin everyone else's dinner also if i pay for a babysitter to have peace and quiet with my husband why should i have to eat my dinner listening to little joey antagonize his sister anyone else agree hey yourmoms for the record i'm not nasty in a restaurant to people who bring good kids or bad kids i'm complaining here instead so back off if it costs me for two meals and we don't drink it's not a family restaurant the napkins are certainly cloth and the plates aren't plastic by family restaurants are fair game i just meant that i'd never complain if there were kids acting crazy at a restaurant like bob evens or fazoli's yes my husband and i taught our children at a young age that they were to have at home manners and in public manners they were told that when we were out in public if they couldn't behave we would leave whatever it was we doing immediately and go home we told them we didn't care if we were dining out at the movies shopping for them etc it made no difference we also told them that when we got home they would have time out and take away their privileges they only tested us once in a restaurant when they were real little or years old and we held true to our word they never misbehaved in public again they are now grown and are just starting out with their own children and they have assured us that they too will have home and public manners as for others' children if they are rowdy and running around we simply ask to be seated somewhere else if that is not possible we either speak to the manager or to the parents directly but we are also very quick to tell other parents on our way out how well behaved their children are  Humphrey Bogart Calvin and Hobbes Friends Shaggy dog story Knots Landing The Apprentice 2 The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Ron and Fez 1957 World Series Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bart Sells His Soul Restaurant Theory of conduct Recurring South Park characters The Fairly OddParents 10 Things I Hate About You Mojave people One Tree Hill (TV series) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Customs and etiquette of Japan The Human Stain Stewie Griffin Little Britain Kitchen Cuisine of Denmark Eddie Guerrero Doug Pitaten 613 mitzvot Time Out of Mind Hey Arnold!

neighbor with noisy bed springs my neighbor gets laid about once a month and when he she gets busy the bed springs squeak so loudly that they wake me up in the middle of the night here's the problem i can't tell which neighbor it is since i live on the bottom floor of the apartment should i just leave a note on everyone's door oh give me a break beds should not be so loud they wake a person up during the night i've lived in apartments for years and never experienced anything like this it's loud that's terrible i know b c i deal with that a few times a week my neighbors above me screw like rabbits good for them but i have to hear it one night i tried jumping on my bed to bang on my ceiling their floor in an effort to get them to stop i found out the hard way that the ceiling is made of concrete so i smashed my hand and i still had to hear all of the squeaking you could leave an anonymous note on their door to politely ask them to keep it down however you run the risk of ticking them off and they could end up making more noise just to spite you in the end you're probably better off just not saying anything especially since you don't know what unit the noise is coming from specifically  Mattress Hearing impairment Shaggy dog story Blood Simple 1957 World Series Richard Chase Avenue Q Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Guinea pig Door Sento Sin City Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Milton H.

how do i ask my roommate not to eat drink my food drinks i just moved into my new place recently and noticed that my roommate has been drinking my beverages normally i would not have a problem with this had they asked me first however i am on a really tight budget and can't afford to share my food plus i work long days so i dont' have time to grocery shop all the time so when i come home i want to have my food intact for example i bought a case of water bottles this morning i woke up with killer cramps but had no water left to take my ibuprofren with and therefore am in a lot of pain my roommate is a nice person so i don't want to start things off on the wrong foot help to roommate i can't afford to treat us to food and drink but i will gladly pick up enough for you if you can give me the money before i shop it isn't a problem to share but i don't have the money to get enough supplies for both of us i am sure that you understand so do you want to pay me now and i will go shopping it is a yes or no response from here you haven't insulted them or hollered so there should be no hard feelings only a guilty sneak would put up a fuss or make trouble at this point you didn't move in with a guilty sneak though your gentle words in a soft voice capture more attention than hollering or whining that would only start a fight and put them on the defensive keep it peaceful but look them in the eye  Social rule The Catcher in the Rye Avenue Q Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Hiberno-English Humphrey Bogart Customs and etiquette of Japan Knots Landing Singlish Sin City Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Time Out of Mind Milton H.

when you are in your car and a funeral procession passes you are you supposed to stop what is the rule of thumb on this in years gone by say up to years ago cars and pedestrians would automatically stop until the hearst had gone by and even waiting sometimes for the whole funeral procession to go by now traffic actually goes around this procession in the larger cities and towns i am hoping that somewhere in n america people still have the decency to give a fellow citizen his very last tribute as well people would often times put their right hand over their heart in tribute it makes you think of your own mortality and do a good job that day  Traffic Paul Is Dead Vehicular cycling 2000 Australian Grand Prix State funeral of John F.

how to deal with double standard people there are project managers and superiors who tend to use different yard sticks while making promotions and dealing with members of the same team how do i make them realise that their actions can divide the team which might not be in favour of the whole team the the organization supports your boss then you're a bit out of luck however most companies have standards for bonues promotions and evaluations they need to use standardized tools and documentation needs to back up everything don't be afraid to disagree with an evaluation or to be proactive when you hear about a promotion i always document all of my accomplishments for the year every year i updated my resume even though i have no intention of applying for another job however it gives me opportunity to review what i've done and how i've contributed to the company i would bring this documentation to the table when discussing promotions with your boss i would bring documentation on departmental movement as well i would say i notice that john x sally y and pat z all were promoted to super lead after months of work on this project i've now completed months of work on this project and would like to know how to get to the next step on my career ladder  Software engineering Alex Ferguson Requirements analysis United Kingdom corporation tax Cincinnati Bengals Information Services Procurement Library Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Management PRINCE2 The Apprentice 2 Jack Charlton Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti OpenBSD Principal-agent problem Quality control Rational Unified Process Information Technology Infrastructure Library Senate Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq Consensus decision-making Poker jargon New York Giants Professional wrestling match types Project management Product Lifecycle Management Anarchism and society Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Firefighter Bryan Robson Management information system Open-source software Amway Kansas City Chiefs Game development XML Corporate governance Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China West Bromwich Albion F.C.

to what extent eye contact can tell one's thought people emotional express through eye thus more or less you can judge someone thought through his her eye expression how good a pretender might his eye betray him and fail to lie in scenario if a friend try to avoid eye contact with you on the street what is the reason and meaning is that mean he or she reject to show his or her friendliness to you eye contact is not a reliable way of understanding what someone else is thinking or if they are telling the truth the eyes are not often the window to the soul even though we want them to be what we are often reading are the muscles around the eyes eye contact has different meaning in different cultures also each individual uses eye contact differently some people attempt to bore holes through you while other people hardly make eye contact at all i do notice when someone has unusual ways of looking at me other people i think the ones who stare or use penetrating gazes are either weird or attempting to intimidate those who use soft gazes may be truly gentle souls or may simply be well practiced in putting people at ease those who avoid eye contact may be introverts not necessarily shy but simply wanting to maintain a private sense of themselves and the sociopathic dead eyes that crime writers like to describe the flat gaze of a shark well that's not always easy to spot and only occurs when such a person is actually revealing themselves which isn't all that often but i've seen it and it is chilling i wish you could have a guaranteed way of knowing if someone is lying or trying to avoid you but there are no sure answers just do your best to be honest and to communicate well if someone avoids you for being that way then it's their loss  Eye contact Social rule Theory of conduct Lie Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Deconstruction Evil Goodness and value theory Theodicy Plame affair Simone Weil Philosophy of language Alexander Technique The Amber Spyglass Out-of-body experience Sant Thakar Singh Religion Animism Epistemology A Course In Miracles Martial art Sin Milton H.

movie invitation problem at work a woman i thought was a friend begged me to go to the movies with her and a male employee who asked her to go and she agreed this wednesday evening really she doesn't want to go at all and wants me to go to be a buffer we are all over i said no she kept nagging so to be polite i said i would think about it by the way she is married i am too and he is not i have no intentions of going as i don't even like this guy it would be a friends only thing but even then i don't want to spend an evening this way other employees think she has some nerve and i am sensible not to go i think if i agreed she would back out and leave me stuck any way it happened someone would wind up hurt or embarrassed as i am now and i didn't even do anything to bring this on i feel like she sees me as some dumb sucker she can rope into this why would someone do this is there anything else i can or should do or say besides be firmer about my intent not to go it's not about this woman seeing that she can rope you into something don't let you get roped she can't force you to go the choice is yours have a back bone if you had no intent to go in the first place you shouldn't have said you would think about it you set yourself up by giving her hope you were smart to see the red flags so next time just say no or that you'll pass if you really can't tell her a simple no tell her something has come up hubby's boss is coming for dinner or something don't worry about politeness be truthful and save yourself  Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Shaggy dog story Friends Sharon Tate Humphrey Bogart Pok__mon Live!

was this rude i'm in cook county illinois and one of my good friends an inmate asked me to pick up her belongings since she is transferring out of the county jail to a state prison she said she spoke with her social worker and that the social worker said that she arranged for her property to be mailed to me then she said to call the trust fund property office just to make sure this all happened last week mind you so i called the trust fund office and they said that they do not mail the inmates belongings and that the inmate would have to write a letter stating that they want me to have their property so my friend called me back monday night and i told her what the office said so she said ok i will mail you a letter first thing tues morning she also said that she should be transferred either thurs or friday of this week so i received the letter yesterday and i called the office up and asked them could still pick up an inmates property saturday and they said yes as long as you have the letter the inmate wrote i said fine so i went today to collect her belongings i waited in line and when it was my turn this police officer looked at me up and down and rudely asked who i was i stated the inmates name and my reason for coming immediately she was like well you have to a letter stating that and since you don't have it you have to leave i said ma'am i have the letter in my hand then she briefly glanced at it and was like this isn't sufficient enough and is the inmate still at this facility i said i'm not sure because she was supposedly leaving this thurs or friday she was like well i can't help you because she may not be here and so she will have to write another letter from the state prison she is transferring to which i may here from her in about weeks so the officer then said was like sorry sweetie and smirked and then said next i was so pissed i plan on calling the trust fund office first thing monday morning my friend couldn't get her items herself because she is being transferred to another prison that's why she asked me to take her property like i said i called the head of the trustfund property dept before i went to go collect her belongings they said a written letter with her signature would be sufficient enough to rev tomcat she's giving you a hard time because she can you know just pushing her weight around wants to give you the run around don't let her get away with that and yes she's rude report her immediately edit tomcat i liked your thoughts on her problem but you know no worries about smuggling drugs out when her friend went in she was already searched and if she had drugs on her it was confiscated by the guards sometimes i wonder what the guards do with all what they confiscate  Social rule Sydney Riot of 1879 Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Eddie Guerrero Simon Adebisi Escape from New York Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Burr Redding Vernon Schillinger Shawn Michaels Ocean's Twelve Hurricane Katrina timeline Captain Thunderbolt Knots Landing Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Schapelle Corby Prisons in the United States James Hanratty Secretar__a de Inteligencia Operation Market Garden Velvet Revolution Prisoner (TV series) Sin City Shaggy dog story RuneScape quests Cornelia Rau Miguel Alvarez Night (book) EastEnders Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Paul Is Dead Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Vivian Solon The Star Wars Holiday Special Ron and Fez Psychiatric hospital Time Out of Mind Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March The nature of God in Western theology Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Black Panther Party The Inside Jon Secada United States Postal Service The Invisibles Property (ownership right) Good Morning, Vietnam Charles Graner Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sharon Tate Enrique Morales Cindy Sheehan The Shawshank Redemption John Dillinger 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Theory of conduct Blood on the Tracks Extreme Programming Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mordechai Vanunu Piccolo Junior Saga Ex-gay About a Boy Martin Luther King, Jr. Ryan O'Reilly The Emancipation of Mimi Weathermen Jean Charles de Menezes Make money fast 2001 anthrax attacks Singapore gay equality movement Donald Rumsfeld Ben Johnson (athlete) The Chemical Brothers Slow Train Coming Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina The Silence of the Lambs Plame affair Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Pitaten Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Dead Like Me British Free Corps May 2005 in Australia and New Zealand Live 8 CPU cache Surveillance Advance fee fraud MoveOn

what are excellent excuses not to drink i know just simply not wanting to drink should be a legitimate excuse to not drink but what if youre around people who really feel they need to pressure you into drinking what excuses will stand up to their bullying i dont have any problems with others drinking but its just not something i enjoy anyone got any really good reasons not do drink i can have a great time without needing to resort to alcohol perhpas even medical reasons that would make the 'drinkers' more understanding of your reasoning i know once everyone starts getting drunk they will stop pestering my reasoning but getting past the first few rounds is where the story needs to be rock solid oh and there is no way i could say i was pregnant lol when i was in high school i told everyone that i was allergic to alcohol and that i would just puke it back up it work for four years straight and nobody ever challenged me on it once the word got around nobody would offer me a drink because they didn't want to waste a beer i actually got a lot of sympathy and a lot of free soda  Alcoholism Mothers Against Drunk Driving Alcoholics Anonymous Oasis (band) One Tree Hill (TV series) Shaggy dog story Michael Garibaldi New Coke Wine Theory of conduct Rape Alcoholic beverage Social rule Soft drink Kodocha Prohibition Poker jargon Sake RuneScape quests Alcohol 2000 Australian Grand Prix Traumatic incident reduction Pitaten Drink __douard Manet About a Boy Urinary incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hypoglycemia Mountain Dew Lorraine Baines McFly Beer Caffeine Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Coffee Guinness Humphrey Bogart Boston Public Vomiting LOL (Internet slang) Public house Springfield Elementary School Yerba mate Bong Moonshine The Catcher in the Rye President (game) Nicomachean Ethics Time Out of Mind Knots Landing Daredevil George Brown, Baron George-Brown Hollyoaks Word of Wisdom Veganism The Contender (television series) Binge drinking Maison Ikkoku Heinkel He 100 Drinking culture Brewery Bottle Wheat beer Breastfeeding Sauna Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Drunk driving (United States) Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Homophobia Equine conformation Parachuting Transactional analysis Liza of Lambeth Characters of Megatokyo Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Gift economy Australian words The O.C.

why is it that we use fork knife for eating and not spoon fork instead i have noticed that forks are predominantly the single most used piece when eating why not the spoon spoons are more effective in picking up food like couscous rice and of course soup and with a spoon it is possible to cut meat vegetables and other food unlike a fork it just makes more sense to use a combination of spoon and fork as opposed to the use of a knife and fork generally speaking the fork is a more versatile eating utensil then the spoon when eating most types of meat a knife is required to properly cut that meat you must use something to hold the meat in place until cut the fork is the best utensil for this job if we use the spoon it would take too long to cut through meat and we could not stab our food to pick it up the fork allows us to stab scoop and hold down our food  Fork Chopsticks Chinese cuisine Spoon Spork Knife Japanese tea ceremony Kosher foods Korean cuisine Jewish cuisine Cuisine of Thailand Russian cuisine Table setting Meal Soup Breakfast Couscous Cuisine of the Philippines Japanese cuisine Sushi Food Dim sum Tofu Vegetarian cuisine Vegetarianism Cuisine of Africa Cuisine of Laos Kashrut Sandwich Cuisine of Denmark French cuisine Joke Spaghetti Burger Bengali cuisine Microwave oven Pea soup Tool Ramen Foodborne illness Escherichia coli O157:H7 German cuisine Food preservation Hamburger Roman eating and drinking Cuisine of the Southern United States Cuisine of Singapore Potato Veganism Pasta Sausage Laksa Cuisine of Brazil Comanche Food storage Curry Dumpling Isan Mango Cantonese cuisine Steak Pancake RuneScape skills Tlingit Sauerkraut Cuisine of Malaysia Sea-Monkey Minestrone Cookware and bakeware Meat Fecal incontinence Drill bit Salad Fingers Mayonnaise Meat analogue Domesticated turkey Cuisine of Vietnam Barbecue Yum cha Mochi Stock (food) Toast Soul food Stir frying Mushroom hunting D__ner kebab Meatloaf Buddhist cuisine Chinese food therapy Aztec Fondue Cuisine of Ethiopia Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Chess terminology Restaurant Chicken soup Tamale Happy Tree Friends Agriculture

birthday etiquette please read more only if you intend to be honest and polite thank you ok after posting my last q and the responders deliberately being rude calling names i will not tolerate any of that nonsense this time heres my dilemma my girls are yr wks apart we have one large party that falls between their bdays every year this is because they're blessed to have such a large extended family that love them and want to attend it makes it easier for family to come in from out of town we live in vegas for one party instead of parties usually around friends family attend that are only wks apart not to mention the pocket book now on each girl s actual bday my hubby i do a small intimate special day catered to whatever the bday girl wants to do that day this year she wants chucke e cheese how do i invite her grandparents pl and aunt uncle cousins pl who live here in town to come enjoy the fun but pay their own way this is not a real birthday party and no presents given since the huge party is only weeks away i m not being cheep we just honestly don t have the money to pay for other than our selves last year we learned the hard way these same people we verbally invited to come hang out and we were left with the bill again let me make it clear this is not a party we send out invitations to nor is there presents exchanged on this small day catered to the bday girl because it s saved for the huge party that falls only weeks later i feel uncomfortable not inviting them because we see her grandparents and aunt her family on a weekly basis since we live in the same town if i don t invite them i know they will have hurt feelings but i just can t afford to cover their bill again this year i feel pressured into it seeing they have more of an income to play with when it comes to these things how do i politely tell them they are more than welcome to come join in the fun but regrettably they will have to cover the cost of their own food drinks game tokens just tell them that your daughter wants to go to cec's on her b day ask them if they would like to join you remind them that it is just a fun outing and that gifts are not expected etc try to arrive before them and order your food when they go through the line they can order theirs  Poker jargon Social rule Birthday Pitaten Garfield Fancy Crane Theory of conduct Wedding Crashers The O.C.

why is someone going to all my answers and giving thumbs down i have been noticing just a meanness directed toward me lately and i think this is not the place for personal vendettas if it is because i reported someone who was not only violating y a policy but the law again shame on you and bless i did the hide thing thanks i am a nice person and have given a lot of help and very good answers for the mean ones again bless i guess it is a big deal because a system means something and it didn't start until recently and if someone doesn't speak up about wrongs then it will be letting bullies go on without doing anything about it this is a nice community of thinking people and there are always those who attempt to ruin somethng good contradictory bless your enemies is an age old philosophy and if i fight hate with love that is my way hello i know you personally and i think you should just not worry about it it is obvious that it bothers you and i know that you are a very kind person with much knowledge in many areas who ever it is obviously believes that you are a kind hearted person too and by doing something as such to you knows it would upset you my saying for circumstances such as this is if you don't feed it it can't grow our old friend randy says be like a duck and just let it roll off your back i haven't been on yahoo answers long so i'm still not up with knowing all the stars points etc but surely others can look at your q a's and see that you obviously have a good record here also seems the yahoo leaders or who ever is in charge of this should be able to tell if someone is trying to make you or anyone look bad they can and sometimes do track all the ip addresses of every user almost all web pages have that capability whether we know it or not modern technology so you know you are a good person and your friends know you're a good person don't give this person the pleasure of it upsetting you please continue to share your opinions and knowledge for those that want it and may need it all storms do pass and eventually the debri gets picked up and thrown away and it'll seem as though it was never there know that what goes around comes around keep up the good you do share who knows you may just be this persons angel someday we never know what we may learn from others have a super blessed day and pray for this person  Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pitaten Predestination Phaedo Social rule Goodness and value theory Epistemology Plame affair Piccolo Junior Saga God Emperor of Dune Sin City Humphrey Bogart Extreme Programming Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism New York Giants Contract Jon Secada Jumpstart 3rd Grade Current teachings of Prem Rawat Evil Free will Blood on the Tracks Nicomachean Ethics One Tree Hill (TV series) Highway 61 Revisited Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Philosophical skepticism Angels in America Muslim ibn Aqeel Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories EastEnders Philosophy of language Poker jargon Sampling (music) Jacob Password The Smoking Room CPU cache Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina True Crime: Streets of LA Shaggy dog story Transactional analysis Friends Avenue Q Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword The nature of God in Western theology Shen Gong Wu The Ashlee Simpson Show Sheepshead StarCraft Episode VI Characters in the Smurfs Milton H.

if your child throws up outside a restaurant do you feel that the employees of the restaurant should clean it up or as a parent do you feel it is just another part of being a parent and it's your responsibility to clean up after your own kid it wasn't my kid the kid wasn't sick just gagged while eating too much and ran out the door there were no tables outside just a line of people waiting to get a table the puke was aimed for the bushes but apparently missed and hit some of the wood decking as well the mother and father were both with this kid the kid went right back to the table and continued to eat the mother was annoyed that no one from the restaurant helped clean up i don't think the employees even knew what was going on i personally think that it is the parent's job to clean up after their kids i would never expect a college aged restaurant worker to clean up vomit outside of the restaurant i would tell the manager of the restaurant that your child had a accident outside and ask for a bucket of water i think it is the responsibility of the parent to clean it up inside or outside  One Tree Hill (TV series) Sento The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Friends Poker jargon Shaggy dog story Milton H.

i spit out of disgust on this guy's confederate flag on his car was i way out of line well iobviously it's pretty rude but i intended it to be rude i thought he deserved it his car also had confederate flags painted on his car and he was wearing them on his tshirt and hat i mean what was this guy trying to prove i know i know they say that the flag isn't always associated with racism and that it can just be a symbol of traditional values or outlaw culture but that's obviously just a cover for modern day racism billed as an almost patriotically fervent un political correctness to the point that it almost becomes fetishistic so anyway this guy made my blood boil i wanted to confront him face to face but he we were in the post office and i didn't want to make a scene so instead on the way out i spat on the flag on his car i know this was rude but do you think it was justified would you have done the same thing yourself or would you sympathize with my action even if you wouldn't go that far yourself or was i way way out of line seeing some of the responses so far i think i need to make a point that some people seem to have missed this is not a first amendment rights issue here i have no problem with the racist sharing his views i'm not trying to silence him i'm merely expressing my opinion of his values just as he's entitled to freedom of speech i am entitled to freedom to judge his speech and disagree with it i didn't rip it down i spat on it it is a temporary sign of disapproval but it is not vandolism well at least you realize that it was rude of you to do that but i don't think you were really out of line to do something like that i wouldn't go that far if i were there i'd just glare at him and make sure he saw me and maybe talk intentionally loud to a friend so he can overhear us rag on him but you were not way out of line however i'd like to say that fetishes rock and that i don't appreciate you associating fetishism with racism in any way  Freedom of speech Racism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Nazism EastEnders Theodicy Patriotism Martin Luther King, Jr. American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Hate speech Originalism Zell Miller Separation of church and state Arab-Israeli conflict Homophobia Plame affair Cindy Sheehan French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools One Tree Hill (TV series) Philosophical skepticism Rick Santorum Richard Littlejohn Liberalism W.

does everyone talk about others behind there back doesnt' it seem like even the people you think you know the best you always find out there saying something about you behind your back my mom always taught me to never say anything about anyone that you wouldn't say right in front of there face and i still use that advice to this day but it makes me upset when i find out someone has said something aweful about me that isn't true but why woudlnt' they say it to my face why are people so two faced it's so aweful do you do this talk about others the minute they leave there's a difference between talking about people behind their backs and talking about them in a mean way behind their backs from my own experience i'd say almost everyone talks about other people human beings are social animals and we are all interested in others who they are what they do wher they come from this type of chit chat makes the world of people go around and keeps the wheels of social interraction oiled however the second type of behaviour where people gossip in a mean way and tell secrets or outright lies about others is thankfully not quite as common the problem is for the affected person it can seem like everyone is doing it in fact it is a form of bullying and sad to say one that girls and women participate in to a great extent although males are not immune to it for many people it is also something they leave behind as they mature and grow up and relise how hurtful such behaviour can be there's not much that can be done against a whispering campaign except to stand tall and proud and do not participate yourself including responding to things you hear if someone tells you that x said so and so that person is part of the chain break the chain by saying 'goodness hasn't x got anything to talk about except me i didn't know my life was so interesting to her ' then change the subject to the latest book or movie in this way you show towo things you are way too mature to get involved in these little kid games and you could care less what x says regardless of what you hear about others don't pass on anything mean unless you hear something an adult should know then definitely tell someone and if you hear a nasty rumour about someone turn it around by saying really i heard she was really nice and a good artist dancer tennis player whatever that way you are helping someone else out and also showing people who are mean mouthed that you are not part of their circle of intimidation once you do you might be surprised to discover just how small that circle is step outside the box and live your own life and you will be free of their hurt good luck and best wishes  Social rule Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct God Emperor of Dune The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe One Tree Hill (TV series) Plame affair Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Death Gate Cycle Jumpstart 3rd Grade Hearing impairment Kodocha About a Boy Humphrey Bogart Milton H.

many of the answerers here suggest lies to solve problems what do you think i left q a for a while and upon coming back i am surprised how many people suggest lying as a solution to simple problems judging by the avators it seems most are young women who are promoting lying the most although certainly both genders do and we have no idea of their real ages this is a generalization every question that has lies suggested as a way to solve the problem also have some honest people suggesting honest solutions does this bother anyone else but the lies shouldn't be here at all with decent moral people and the quantity of suggested lies astounds me traveller i'm sure most of these young people think that the lies they are suggesting are 'harmless white lies' that will get them out of momentary trouble and smooth over hurt feelings of course it is never good to lie and in fact it almost always creates more problems than it solves in the long run but for many people it takes some maturity and experience to realise that people asking questions have a choice of answers to select from why not make yours the most honest and sensible response you can offer so at least that choice is represented you will soon find that honest answers are very often the ones people select for themselves and are recognised by others with 'thumbs up' and so on you can only offer the answers you think are helpful good luck and best wishes  Theory of conduct Scientology beliefs and practices Current teachings of Prem Rawat Goodness and value theory Expert system Halting problem Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Theodicy Utilitarianism Avenue Q God Emperor of Dune Sexual orientation Ethics Adjoint functors Mathematics of general relativity Transactional analysis Complexity classes P and NP The nature of God in Western theology Exact solutions in general relativity Simone Weil Interactive proof system Social rule Mathematics Abortion debate Lie Jumpstart 3rd Grade Gauge theory Alignment (role-playing games) Prices of production Keynesian economics Dynamical system Economics Ordinary differential equation The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Bertrand Russell Quicksort Atomism Incarnations of Immortality The Apprentice 2 Altruism Combinatorics Margaret Mead Philosophy of language Simon Commission Microeconomics Domestic violence Swami Vivekananda Pitaten Alexander Technique IP (complexity) Plame affair French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Bernard Williams Species Diablo II: Lord of Destruction A Course In Miracles Law of value Richard Feynman Software engineering Creationism Leadership The Shining (film) Monty Hall problem Turing test One Tree Hill (TV series) Efficiency wages Genetic algorithm Philosophy of space and time Victor Cousin Infinity Algorithm Coming of Age (TNG episode) Artificial neural network Parsifal Transsexuality Cyprus dispute Mach kernel Zeno's paradoxes Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Scientific method Shaggy dog story Milton H.

what do i say when someone asks me how much something is i was always taught that how much you spend and how much you make per year should never be flaunted but lately i've noticed people asking me how much everything is and i have no idea what to say i don't want to make them feel like i'm better or worse than them so i just come up with an excuse not to tell them how much it is which usually is really lame when i say something like i don't think it's polite to talk about i think i sound like i'm stuck up and i think that i'm better than them what is a polite way to tell them it's none of their business or do you think it really doesn't matter and i should just come out and tell them look at them like they have two heads really this works asking people how much they paid for something is downright rude give 'em the stare down really  Theory of conduct Social rule Kender Shaggy dog story The nature of God in Western theology Miss Saigon Milton H.

need your opinions on an incident my buddy was involved in details below a guy that i recently became friends with asked for my opinion on something and it perplexed me so i decided to ask you all he just finished freshman year at college first month he went kinda crazy but in the end fixed up his act and got decent grades anyhow back in september one saturday night someone he knew got drunk and passed out on her bed as a little prank he gave her a major wedgie and put a chocolate bar down her underwear eventually she found out it was him my friend naturally denied it but eventually felt guilty about it and confessed she said she wouldn't report him points he should have know better but he learned from his mistake i could tell he was feeling very guilty when looking back at it overall he's a nice guy actually he keeps going out of his way for favors like cleaning up someones vomit from drinking escorting girls back when it's really dark etc he keeps worrying that he will be reported i don't think so what about you all the young woman involved has said she will not report him so it's unlikely that she will the fact is just because we apologise doesn't always mean we're going to automatically feel great again sometimes remorse takes a long time to work through our system sometimes you regret things for a long time if he sees this young woman again he could ask if she'd be willing to talk with him for a minute he could buy her a coffee and explain that the matter has been preying on his mind he has obviously never thought of himself as the type to take advantage of someone in a drunken state and he's had a big shock to realise how easy it is to go down that path he'll find it easier to forgive himself for his behaviour if he stops worrying about how it will affect him and think about how it has affected her ask if it has done and if so is there anything he can do to help change that he will earn some respect from himself and maybe her and then he can put the matter behind him cheers  Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Sin City Friends Knots Landing Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct About a Boy The Amber Spyglass Time Out of Mind Futurama (TV series - season 5) Pitaten God Emperor of Dune Characters in the Smurfs Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Sydney Riot of 1879 Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 The Catcher in the Rye Blood on the Tracks Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Big Brother UK series 6 Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Plame affair The Smoking Room The Subtle Knife Jon Secada Fiddler on the Roof One Tree Hill (TV series) The Emancipation of Mimi W.I.T.C.H.

best way to quit i've been working here for a little over months and i am just completely sick of it i'm only and it's my first job but it's like weeks before the biggest weekend i work in a ice cream parlour i'm sure my boss is going to be angry but i just don't want to work there anymore school's almost starting and after this big weekend they're only open days a week anyways i just completely hate the job what should i tell my boss how should i tell her with a letter or verbally and when should i tell her the best way to quit is quickly so your boss has time to replace you frankly with just three weeks left to go you would do yourself a favour to stay and see it out there are going to be many times in life you'll want to give up because you hate something and can't a little practice won't hurt and you'll be earning money at the same time if you are determined to quit approach your boss tomorrow morning before a crowd builds up and say to him her i have to let you know that i'd like to finish up on friday i'll work the weekend if you need someone but i'm afraid i won't be available after that if they ask why rather than saying i hate the job just advise personal reasons you won't be lying and it sounds a little more pressing you could also mention that you know it is the 'big weekend' coming up and that you would be able to be available for those two days if s he cannot find a replacement that would certainly earn you brownie points don't forget also to say how muh you've learned from the job and thank your boss for the opportunity best wishes  EastEnders Eddie Guerrero Kodocha New England Patriots Jon Secada Ron and Fez Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) Ayrton Senna Ocean's Twelve Sydney Riot of 1879 Social rule Eric Bischoff Oasis (band) Wheel of Fortune The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Pok__mon Live!

why do lazy people insist on using the motor carts in the supermarkets leaving the real disabled people to walk around the store when i take my grandmother to the market she always has to walk because the motor carts are always being used by someone else well today when we were leaving out this lazy women drove the cart to her car which was next to mine she had no cane no trouble lifting her grocery's this women was even able to lift the front of the cart to move it out of her way so that she could pull off there was obviously nothing wrong with her or atleast nothing that would stop her from walking around picking up grocery's my grandmother on the other hand can barely walk with a cane why are people so inconsiderate the motor carts are there for people with disablities i wouldnt be so angry if the women actually needed it but she didnt and i see this all the time you guys are right but had i not seen her do all those things at her car i wouldnt be so angry starrrrgazer both asthma and artritis give off physical symptoms if you are having an asthma attack you obviously are not going to be lifting the front of a motor cart the same thing with artritis the only that makes since that any of you people have mentioned is a heart condition which you never wish to see the physical side affects of but if you cant walk around to long with out having problems with your heart i seriously doubt you can lift the front of a motor cart those things are fairly heavy so that leads me back to my conclusion she was being lazy unless there is some other disablity that you all want to tell me about that seems like the general theme that has become so common in america the easiest way is always the best way if the store is only a block away people want to drive a car anyway because it's easier instead of parking in the first spot they find which may be further away they drive around to look for the closest spot to walk the shortest distance they're taking it even a step further by taking away the motor carts for disabled people because it takes a slight amount of effort to push the cart obviously they have no excuse for this so i would go as far to have an employee make an announcement saying we have a person who needs mobile assistance in the store anyone who does not require the aid of a motor cart who is on one please return it to the front of the store maybe it wouldn't work but you might as well fight for fairness  Aerial (dance move) Indianapolis 500 Shopping cart Equine conformation Supermarket Trailer Park Boys Toyota Prius Golf Escalator Professional wrestling throws Textile manufacturing Volleyball Operation Market Garden Hard disk Asthma The Apprentice 2 Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Jackass: The Movie The Time Machine Drowning Recumbent bicycle School bus Bicycle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Target Corporation Drag racing Jam (TV series) Captain Thunderbolt Mental retardation Motorcycle Combat stress reaction Breastfeeding Champ Car Swimming Electric vehicle Autopsy Tesco 2000 Australian Grand Prix Theory of conduct Bubble Bobble Urinary incontinence Escape from New York Shaggy dog story Married... with Children Hearing impairment Roller coaster Social rule Father's Day (Doctor Who) Hybrid vehicle Personal rapid transit Public transport 1957 World Series Armoured warfare Narcolepsy Wal-Mart The Contender (television series) Neighbours Eddie Guerrero Automobile Sin City Babe Ruth Traffic light Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Cerebral palsy Traumatic brain injury Stuttering Manual transmission Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Tank Mojave people Ammunition Table tennis John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Battery electric vehicle Vehicular cycling Knots Landing Car handling Expert system Insurance Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Inflation Skateboarding trick Milton H.

how politely invite friends to dinner but tell them they will have to pay for their own meals read more my girls are year and weeks apart every year we throw one large family friends party at our house on a day that falls between our girls birthdays on each girl s actual birthday we do a small scale day catered to them with immediate family this year my daughter wants to go to chuck e cheese how do we invite grandparents and her closest cousins parents to come hang out and have fun but make it clear that if they come they will need to pay for their own food drinks game tokens i'm not being cheep i just can't afford to throw huge dinner party usually around people come and two small parties every year grandparents and sister brother in law their kids come i learned the hard way last year i was stuck with the bill at chuck e cheese for plus the large party costs on top of it i'm not made of money how is the most polite way to tell immediate family they are welcome to come join but pay their own way thanks in advance this is a verbal invite last minute since her birthday is next week i don't want to pay for anyone since in another weeks i will be hosting the family friends party at my house feeding them dinner and giving treat bags my daughter wants grandma grandpa and aunt uncle cousins to be part of her special day last year we did the same verbal invitation and i thought everyone would understand they were on their own but instead they all ordered what they wanted and never pitched in when the bill came i think a nice way to say this essentially without saying it is to use the phrase dutch saying this works fold it gets the point across it says that this practice is not only socially pertinent but widespread  Family Hey Arnold!

people with no manners how do you put up with people with no manners without telling them something rude and looking like an hole typically i find that the best response to rude behavior is either to ignore it or to tell the other person exactly how their behavior is affecting you make it about the behavior not them and how it makes you feel or how you're impacted for example instead of saying oh that's so gross i can't believe you chew with your mouth open didn't your mother teach you any manners try this ya know i feel really uncomfortable when you eat with your mouth open like that because i can see your food and it's pretty unappetizing from across the table something like that by taking it to an objective place you're less likely to get a defensive response good luck  Mojave people Social rule Asperger syndrome Etiquette Theory of conduct Customs and etiquette of Japan Evil Poker jargon Milton H.

what is a polite way to tell people to please remove their shoes when coming in your house i love my mom in law but i am very frustrated with her forgetting to remove her shoes when she comes into our house i have a month old baby that crawls everywhere and i really don't want the extra dirt on the floor i made a point to tell her that a contractor had been at the house and got dirt all over the floor with his boots hoping that would refresh her memory that we all take our shoes off at the door it worked that time but the next few times her shoes stayed on i should also mention that she is physically capable of taking off her shoes and that she does it in her own home we both have houses less than one year old i'm pregnant and i'm sick and tired of mopping the floor after she comes over i can't seem to find a nice way to make a strong point that the shoes need to come off please help thanks we too have a no shoes policy in our household for the exact same reason as you hygiene while most respect our rule and get the hint when they see shoes by the door we still have the one or two who for whatever reason feel compelled not to remove their shoes the problem was solved when we put a please remove your shoes sign above the doorbell we had it engraved on a brass plate also we provide house slippers for those who prefer to have something on their feet once inside or those surgical booties to put over their shoes their choice you can also kindly ask her if she forgets could you please take your shoes off we're a no shoes household for the baby's sake thanks good luck  Shoe Sento Qiang Customs and etiquette of Japan Horseshoe High-heeled shoe Social rule Abortion debate Japanese toilet Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sock Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jewish bereavement Jumpstart 3rd Grade Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Cindy Sheehan Poker jargon Burial The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Volleyball Humphrey Bogart Friends Paul Is Dead Scenes from a Memory Saint Nicholas CPU cache Footwear Characters in the Smurfs Expert system Tag The Death Gate Cycle 2000 Australian Grand Prix Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Sharon Tate Jon Secada Richard Chase Glossary of climbing terms Simone Weil Obstetrics My Life as a Teenage Robot Abortion Rent (musical) Vacuum cleaner Charles Goodyear The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Cliff Richard Hygiene Pitaten The Fairly OddParents Abortion in the United States Softball The Smoking Room Samuel Goldwyn Utilitarianism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Motorcycle Tupac Shakur Coming of Age (TNG episode) Sin City Drag racing The Evil Queen/Christine Slevil-Lewis-White (The 10th Kingdom) Childbirth Marching band Sex and the City Kurt Cobain Married... with Children Infantilism EastEnders The Inside Slipper Massachusetts Institute of Technology Silent Hill G-Man (Half-Life) The Adventures of Pete & Pete Glossary of partner dance terms The Marshall Mathers LP RuneScape quests Japanese tea ceremony Holes (book) The McGuire Sisters Foot Time Out of Mind Fasting Futurama (TV series - season 5) Conspiracy (TNG episode) Caving Bernard Williams Phoebe Buffay's songs Kimi Finster Combine (Half-Life 2) Series finale Bike lane debate M16 (rifle) Super Mario Bros. 3 Irish dance Charles Peace

people a first chance i like helping people when i can i have a family with high expectation i have two sisters and i am the middle child both of my sisters are very pretty so it pretty much sucked

how would you feel if everyone in your office forgot your birthday well that basically happened to me and i'm kinda sad about it o last year i didnt mention anything because that's not exactly a proper thing to do but when i told them a few days after it they said why didnt you tell us we would have taken you out for lunch so this year i told them ahead of time but in a discreet way ya know and yet still they somehow forgot and didnt realize what i was saying they didnt even tell me happy birthday i turned last sunday the th there were other august birthdays so far in our suite and their bosses did cake lunch for them but i got nothin' o i feel soo unloved it's a total bummer that no one remembered my birthday o the last job i had i probably wouldn't care and would have expected it from most people because i worked with a bunch of self important a holes in your situation i probably would have been a little upset especially if i'd made an effort to contribute to other people's birthday celebrations and made an effort to wish them a happy birthday it's probably a bit of butthead move but in the future don't bother with other people when it's their birthday if they can't be bothered with you then why make the effort with them i know it sounds a bit petty but that's the way office politics work so long as you celebrated and had a good time with the people that actually matter to you then who cares right  Social rule Friends Pok__mon Live!

honesty that is not asked for does any hate people who just blurt out whatever comes to mind without you asking them and then they make excuses like free speech or i was just being honest this is just plain rude if someone did not ask don't say it i think people would be better of not saying anything that might offend someone even if they beleive it to be the truth it's only their opinion anyways however if they ask then you should give your honest opinion but don't make the mistake of talking about things that you were not invited to discuss or comment on i personally find it aggravating when you know someone is thinking something and they talk about it to everyone but yourself they don't want to hurt your feelings but they don't mind trashing you to everyone else  Theory of conduct Social rule Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Honesty Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Sydney Riot of 1879 Anti-Mormonism Hate speech U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Plame affair Cindy Sheehan Ann Coulter Homophobia Jon Secada Religious Society of Friends Bill O'Reilly (commentator) One Tree Hill (TV series) Agnosticism Polyamory Lie American Psycho Freedom of speech Rick Santorum Fahrenheit 9/11 Transactional analysis Autism rights movement Bullshit Another Side of Bob Dylan The nature of God in Western theology Epistemology Scrooge McDuck Slander and libel Indian Round Table Conferences 1931-1933 Time Out of Mind The writing of Principia Mathematica Alcoholics Anonymous Noam Chomsky Prem Rawat Milton H.

death and weddings my husband and i were married a little while ago because of the military but we've decided to have an actual celebration with our friends and family finally about two years ago my best friend died i want to invite her boyfriend at the time but i know he is still very muchly depressed and i sense he doesn't want to come because it will be too sad for him he was planning to propose before she passed i don't know how to handle the situation and let him know that we love him and want him to come without making things worse for him or making him feel more even more saddened obviously we would never not invite him what kind of savages would we be i just want to know how to go about talking to him apart from a simple written invitation to make him feel more at ease with the situation i spoke with him on the phone and when i mentioned the possibility he was not at all excited in fact he sounded quite saddened as if i had reminded him of the loss in which case how when we send the actual invite do we talk to him about it give him a heads up write a letter call e mail and just tell him you are having a wedding celebration you love him and want him to attend but will understand if he can't attend due to his sorrow tell him the invite is coming unless he says not to send it i hope his sorrow has lessened enough to allow him to attend in the two years since his loss he may have resigned himself to attending weddings ask him if he wants a job at the wedding something that will keep him so busy he won't have time to think of his loss manning the guest register where he asks each and every guest to sign it or usher just might do that it is a tradition to remember departed loved ones at weddings in a community near mine a candle is lit by the bride and groom and next to it is a picture of the departed not a word is said sometimes a seat is left empty with a rose or a ribbon there to mark it it depends on you and your feelings to your departed friend would she be right beside you in your plans and at the ceremony and if you care to do this in my community this is not done sometimes it helps to recogognize grief and deal with it though that is not for everyone good luck and my sympathy to your friend and to you on not having her here at this important time  Fiddler on the Roof Friends Pitaten White wedding God Emperor of Dune Theory of conduct EastEnders Avenue Q Rent (musical) Mojave people Reaction to the assassination of John F.

is it inappropriate to wear the ring after the break up for my twentieth birthday this past january my now ex boyfriend gave me a gorgeous birthstone ring we'd only been going out four months and it wasn't an engagement ring although i think he might have thought of it as some sort of promise ring he never came out and said that it was directly but i got that impression from the way he acted about it we ended up breaking up but i still have the ring i want to wear it but i'm not sure if that's exactly 'appropriate ' it just seems kind of weird to be wearing the ex's ring am i totally crazy here or should i leave it in the jewelry box treat it as a gift given to you when times were better if you can't get over thinking of him each time you look at it then you are better off giving it away however if you enjoy wearing it because you think it's pretty release the weird feelings and enjoy it there were no strings attached to it and you shouldn't worry  Birthday Engagement ring Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Kodocha Charmed The Ashlee Simpson Show Jennifer Lopez Theory of conduct Social rule Eddie Guerrero "Weird Al" Yankovic Spidey Super Stories Piccolo Junior Saga Humphrey Bogart The Contender (television series) Earring Greg Valentine One Ring Wedding ring Magic (illusion) Strap-on dildo Infantilism Jewellery Friends Diamond Totally Spies!

what should i do i tried to post this earlier but it didn't go through if it double posts i'm sorry the bf is out of town this week and i thought it would be a nice surprise to clean up his apartment for him before he gets back he has been super busy lately and it has gotten a little messier than he likes to keep it and i know it has been bothering him i hate to come home to a mess too my question is this when i am cleaning what should i do about his paperwork work stuff i don't want to mess anything up or misplace something he really needs how should i approach this i don't want the pleasure of the surprise to be ruined by me having screwed something important up i wouldn't throw anything out i know you are trying to clean the place up but even if something is misplaced that could send him into a tailspin which would defeat your purpose i would stick to places that you know will be easy to clean like the kitchen bathroom bedroom and living room i would avoid any place like an office if he has any paperwork or business materials in any of the places listed above i would either clean around it or move the materials clean the area and then put the materials back exactly how they were i know this seems to totally defeat the purpose but cleaning paper clutter is a whole lot easier and a more manageable task than cleaning an entire home the day he gets back offer to cook him his favorite dinner or order his favorite take out while he goes through his paperwork that at least gives him incentive to go through it  Kitchen Avenue Q Theory of conduct The Shining (film) Time Out of Mind The Apprentice 2 Ron Weasley Toilet paper Shaggy dog story 2000 Australian Grand Prix Violin The Apprentice 3 Hell's Kitchen (television) Blonde on Blonde Phoebe Buffay's songs Piccolo Junior Saga St. Elmo's Fire (film) Blood on the Tracks Upholstery Humphrey Bogart Survivor (novel) The Contender (television series) Walt Disney World College Program StarCraft: Uprising Hey Jude Super Chief The Inside Knots Landing Discworld gods Claremont McKenna College Battle of Stalingrad Japanese toilet Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Mach kernel Little Britain Thinks ...

what tips would you suggest to someone who's going to start using local transit bus train regularly i live in nyc where mass transit is the most common transportation method here are what i'd consider the most important tips leave yourself extra time if you do not know how to get someplace ask most people are happy to help take a magazine or book or listen to music don't get frustrated just enjoy the fact that you aren't gripping the steering wheel feeling like you should be going faster courtesies give your seat to pregnant women small children older people or people carrying heavy things always let people off the bus or train before you try to get on do not take up more than one seat do not wrap your body around the hand holds or lean on them unless the train or bus is not crowded at all be careful of bumping other people with your bag if you're carrying a bookbag take it off and carry it in front of you when you get on the train or bus do not have extremely loud conversations on the bus or train either on your cellphone or with other people once you get used to mass transit its actually a great way to get someplace stress free  Car handling Social rule Shaggy dog story Personal rapid transit New York City Subway Public transport Bicycle Dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sport rowing Strap-on dildo Rapid transit Internal ballistics Rosa Parks Professional wrestling throws 2000 Australian Grand Prix School bus Mass transit in New York City Extreme Programming Bus rapid transit Diving Montgomery Bus Boycott M16 (rifle) Transportation of Los Angeles Customs and etiquette of Japan Drag racing Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Salute Wayne Corporation Bus Rail tracks Swingout Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway Airbag Articulated bus Combine (Half-Life 2) 7 July 2005 London bombings Violin Ford Mustang Tenshinhan Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Taxicab Autism Muni Metro Toronto Transit Commission Steering Marie Antoinette Light rail Theory of conduct Umphrey's McGee Fecal incontinence GO Transit Bus models used in New York City Transit Childbirth Driver's license Terrorism against Israel in 2002 Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority Hydrogen vehicle Drifting (motorsport) OC Transpo Parachuting Laura Schlessinger Equine conformation Auto rickshaw Bay Area Rapid Transit Industrial Revolution Twin City Rapid Transit Car safety Upholstery Tattoo Aikido Friends Spacecraft propulsion Hiawatha Line The Magic School Bus RoadShow Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Punt (boat) Sailing Telephone exchange Volvo B10TL Urinary incontinence Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Knots Landing Marilyn Monroe Chevrolet Corvair Hitchhiking Paragliding Transportation to New York City area airports Tire Abortion debate Advertising Chicken Octopus card Station wagon Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

wedding invite problem help what's the best way to handle this this is kind of a long story but i will try to sum it up in a nutshell i invited select people on my step dad's side of the family the reason i had to be select is because most of his family is very rude and downright mean at times which is completely opposite of my mom's side of the family anyway i invited my step aunt and her children but i did not invite her on again off again husband for many reasons he is the definition of a scumbag he says rude crude things and has no manners what so ever the last time i saw him he told me to ask my mom if he could suck her pu y he was always crude to my mom and makes me feel very uncomfortable howver i just heard that he might be coming to the wedding i haven't received the rsvp yet but when i do what should i do if she rsvp's that he is coming i know my fiance won't allow it either because he knows even more than i can type please help if possible i think you should have your step dad say something to his sister explaining your feelings make sure she understands that she and the children are more than welcome but if she brings him along they will be asked to leave if your step dad isn't able to make the conversation you do it asap don't even wait for the rsvp card just call her up and say i don't know if they invitation makes this clear but you and the children are invited but your husband is not he and my mother haven't gotten along in the past put it diplomatically and i don't think it is a good idea to get the two of them in the same room be firm but don't say anything nasty if she gets angry let her but don't let yourself get swept up in her emotions remember this is your wedding you have the right to have guests there you enjoy and not have to cater to people who you don't  Social rule Futurama (TV series - season 5) Shaggy dog story Friends Theory of conduct Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Haven (TNG episode) Avenue Q God Emperor of Dune EastEnders Time Out of Mind The nature of God in Western theology The Shining (film) Kender The Young Ones (TV series) Pok__mon Live!

what happened to personal space i find myself at a company where touching seems to be commonplace this makes me uncomfortable i find it unnecessary and very unprofessional i don t mean to sound frigid or antisocial but i was brought up to respect personal space and was taught that physical closeness touching is an intimate thing that is reserved for family close friends and significant others the thing is i don t comprehend by osmosis so if you are explaining something to me then you needn t put your hand on my shoulder or back i understand you quite well via the use of my ears likewise if you are speaking to me then you needn t stand so close to me that your nose is merely inches from mine i have no hearing impairments i hear quite well what really gets me is when i take a step back the close talker takes a step forward when i have said please don t touch me the toucher does it again down the line why is it so difficult to respect someone s personal space haha i understand completely when i transitioned from working for an american bank to a french one the continental europeans would stand so close i felt like our noses were about to touch when they were talking to me for me i feel the best thing to do is just make the other person feel at ease if they feel they need to stand four inches from you to talk to you let them by putting them at ease they can talk about the work situation they need to get through as long as it doesn't cross a line into inappropriate i did once try to say something but it made things terribly awkward and that person just felt like they couldn't work with me anymore which you don't want if it really bothers you and you want to change things when they are standing there and you walk up to speak with them stop two feet away then three build it up until you've got your bubble and it will not be a shock to them they'll barely notice regarding the pat on the back etc i haven't figured out what to do with that except ignore and don't reciprocate in the hopes that they will catch on also be aware that they are trying to convey emphasis or kindness with their gestures so you will have to compensate if you don't want gestures touching make up for it with a kinder softer tone more intonation emphasis they'll realize your method gets the job done sufficiently  Social rule Milton H.

name for baby embarrasing in social situations hello i'm asking this question here because i want to know what people think will happen to my child in social situations or will she face rudeness in the future my wife and i are picking out names for our new child our last name is jones and we want an unusual first name for the child my brother is against the names below and is trying to persuade me to name them a so called normal name let us know what you think of the names and if you feel these names are obnoxious we like boy names lidell parqwell jarteel hyleek rysteef girl names shaquinda lybinda yoquisha jocquilla wakanella lidell is probably the only one i would go with there are certain stereotypes associated with unusual names particularly racial ones and regardless of how far we've come the world is still not a friendly place aside from that as the spellings are rather difficult it may take your child longer to learn how to spell his or her name if you want to give your child an uncommon name try choosing something that people have heard and can pronounce but is less likely to make your child feel singled out when the teacher can't even say it  Infantilism Social rule Autism Phoebe Halliwell Doug Charmed Asperger syndrome Adoption Japanese name Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Family name Breastfeeding Friends Bah__'__ Faith and Education Leo Wyatt Hearing impairment Androgen insensitivity syndrome Mojave people Joke Transsexuality Dyslexia Non-native pronunciations of English Sex assignment Stuttering Sant Thakar Singh Runaways (comics) Drama Married... with Children Milton H.

am i being clingy so i've been with my boyfriend for years all of a sudden i feel like i'm being really clingy like if he doesn't call me for a day i think something is terribly wrong i know it's just because he's about ready to leave for a backpacking trip for the next week and i won't be able to even talk to him because he won't get service on the trails not only that but i'm hours away from him right now because we i went home for a week to see my family and our homes are hours away we met at college but it seems like he doesn't really want to talk to me that badly normally he is really excited when i call and has alot to say but for the past day he hasn't been so now i'm all paranoid that he's going to break up with me when he gets back or something he does stay up late to talk to me still but now i feel like i care more like he's too busy he says that he does really miss me but he's just been acting different the past day do you think it's just because he's busy yes you're being clingy that said it's a natural reaction to prolonged seperation in a young relationship and yes years is young you just have to remember to keep some perspective the odds are he's just distracted by the fact that he's home and all that that entails catching up with family and friends checking out old haunts and realizing that home isn't the way you remember it also he's got a big trip coming up and that's probably on his mind as well just remember to breathe he's been with you for a year and a half things have gone well so far and will likely continue to do so find something to do to distract yourself explore a hobby you've been putting off while he's around call up a girlfriend you haven't seen in a while set up a theme night outing bowling and dinner dressed as miss usa contestants as a random example with a group of friends and put your extra time and nervous energy into preparing for that don't get all worked up and him centric while he's gone if you do you'll be miserable the whole time he's gone no relationship is healthy if every second is about the relationship you had your own interests before you met him right how are those interests doing now have you let them whither and die while you spend time with him those interests are part of why he fell for you in the first place use this time apart to rekindle them and return to your roots when he comes back you'll be happy to see him and you'll have things to talk to him about and share with him and on the cynical side if he does decide to break up with you when he gets back you'll already have a list of other things to do that don't require him  Friends Shaggy dog story EastEnders Theory of conduct Avenue Q Social rule Pitaten The Smoking Room The Amber Spyglass Miss Saigon 1957 World Series Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ocean's Twelve New York Giants Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind One Tree Hill (TV series) T'Pol Poker jargon The Ashlee Simpson Show Big Brother UK series 6 Phoebe Halliwell Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) W.I.T.C.H.

if you got food poisoning from dining out should you notify the restaurant people often say i ate at a takeaway place a few hours ago and then got sick i got food poisoning that is not necessarily true although many people want to associate their discomfort with the last meal they ate because that's the meal that came back up you can't make that assumption incubation periods for the bacteria and viruses that cause food borne illnesses range from several hours to several weeks for most types of food borne illness the time elapsed between ingestion and symptoms will be to hours it could have been something you ate two days ago if you really had gotten food poisoning from a restaurant there would be other reports the only true way to know if you got food poisoning is to go to the doctor he will take stool and urine samples and pinpoint exactly what the problem is you should also contact your county health department  Foodborne illness Food Restaurant Stomach cancer Hypoglycemia Common cold Diarrhea Botulism Norwalk virus group Pneumonia Vitamin C Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Coeliac disease Escherichia coli O157:H7 Nutrition Poison Eating Guinea pig Fugu Vegetarianism Rotavirus Medicine Urinary incontinence Group A streptococcal infection Chronic fatigue syndrome Dairy Herpes simplex virus Raw food diet Gonorrhoea Anorexia nervosa Radiation poisoning Vomiting Cheese Natural Hygiene Gastroesophageal reflux disease Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cytomegalovirus Marburg virus Trichinosis Charles Darwin's illness Fasting Hamster Rabies Sexually-transmitted infection Folic acid Biological warfare Dim sum Prostate cancer Ascariasis Eating disorder Poliomyelitis Mushroom poisoning Irritable bowel syndrome Tooth Bulimia nervosa Taboo food and drink Dental caries Hyperglycemia Insulin Traditional Chinese medicine H5N1 Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Cafeteria Allergy Leptospirosis Reiter's syndrome Flatulence Entamoeba histolytica Kashrut Chinatown Fast food DDT Chocolate Diabetes mellitus Disease Dog Gastroparesis Medical prescription Breastfeeding Oral sex Aspartame Food allergy Hedgehog Cantonese cuisine Monkeypox Cat Natural health Certified Nursing Assistant Veganism Tomato Decompression sickness Bipolar disorder Super Size Me Warfarin

can someone offer me etiquette advice before i visit a friend from mexico tomorrow my friend rosa from jalisco mexico is cooking tamales for my entire family tomorrow her food is amazing i just wondered if there was anything i should know about customs etiquette etc what would be a nice hostess gift there is a pretty big language barrier yet we have become good friends so i want to behave politely while visiting her home thanks in advance i'm mexican and agree with most of what the other guys have said i like the pot plant gift idea it's something that everybody welcomes and bringing something for dessert is also something that we do a lot when visiting and having dinner at a friend's place a bottle of wine is acceptable too but it doesn't go that well with the tamales also beware tamales are not eaten with your hands if they serve bread with them then you are allowed to make yourself a torta de tamal you put the tamal inside the bread to make a sort of sandwich and eat it with your hands but only that we do not consider it impolite if you eat all of the food in your plate and even ask for more if that's what you feel like doing you can also try to help when serving the beverages during meal time or when they start picking up the table after dinner but as they said they will most likely not allow you to help you can also offer to help them serve the dessert especially if you brought it coffee enjoy the tamales i'm sure they'll be delicious i love them and my mom cooks some wonderful tamales as well  Tamale Meal Cuisine of the Philippines Customs and etiquette of Japan Chopsticks Korean cuisine Breakfast French cuisine Passover Tea (meal) Jewish cuisine Peruvian cuisine Kitchen German cuisine Restaurant Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hamburger Cuisine of Argentina Tomato Cha chaan teng Japanese cuisine Yum cha Coffee Kosher foods Fondue Comanche Little Britain Passover Seder Tea McDonald's Domesticated turkey Chinese cuisine Pea soup Pizza Cuisine of Turkey Coffeehouse Food Swedish cuisine Flour Wine The Apprentice 2 Tofu Cuisine of Laos Etiquette British cuisine Apple Day of the Dead Sandwich Christmas worldwide Bread 613 mitzvot Eucharist Dumpling The Fairly OddParents Cuisine of the Southern United States Rice pudding Epcot Mojave people Conveyor belt sushi RuneScape quests Betting (poker) Banana Singlish Futurama (TV series - season 4) Mexican cuisine Poker jargon Alcoholic beverage Fruits Basket Theory of conduct Dim sum Funeral Barbecue Ice cream The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Hot dog MRE Pasta Hell's Kitchen (television) Garfield Mexico Recipe Supper Pancake Spanish cuisine Marmite Tuxtla Guti__rrez W.I.T.C.H.

should talking on your cell phone while driving be illegal why or why not and if so shouldn't listening to the radio or eating in the car be illegal too the research that i have seen reported in the paper is that there are a whole variety of things that can distract drivers one they never mention is having a patrol car pull in behind you and follow you for a few minutes that's pretty distracting things like eating putting on make up looking for a cd dealing with baby in carseat just talking with a passenger have all been found to be distracting in that they divert your attention from the road so i don't think that talking on cell should be singled out the other side to this is that these things can also be a way for a driver to stay awake and alert on a longer trip if you start geting tired and you call a friend to talk to or put in a lively music cd or eat a snack that can really help  Billboard (advertising) Taxicab Mobile phone Drag racing Road traffic accident Shaggy dog story The Hitch-Hiker (The Twilight Zone) United Airlines Flight 93 Social rule Milton H.

grocery guilt yesterday i went grocery shopping and one of the baggers helped me out with my groceries even though i told him that i could take them out myself that i didn't have anything to tip him with ect he said that it's a service which the grocery store provides and he didn't need a tip he was very sweet but i left feeling guilty the reasons why i feel guilty is that a i'm perfectly able bodied and b even if a tip's not expected i would sort of feel better if i could tip him should i feel guilty i thanked him repeatedly told him how nice he was no you should not feel guilty in fact it annoys me when people insist on helping me when i tell them no thank you i'll get it myself if i wanted help when it was offered i'd say thank you where i live i think it's store policy not to allow baggers to accept tips but a few people do lure them out to their cars to tip them which is nice but definitely don't feel guilty  Wal-Mart The Apprentice 2 Knots Landing Plame affair Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina EastEnders Target Corporation Supermarket Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an George Costanza Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Sharon Tate Tip Mojave people Roxette Bon Jovi Leo Frank Henry Lee Lucas Neighbours Eric Robert Rudolph Theory of conduct Guilt Little Britain Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Sears Holdings Corporation Karl Rove Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Tesco Mumia Abu-Jamal The Lovely Bones Transactional analysis Barbra Streisand On Her Majesty's Secret Service Infidels Internet troll Clinical depression Phil Hendrie Trials since the Fiji coup of 2000 Questionable Content West Memphis 3 Humphrey Bogart The Inside Wall Street Goldfinger One Piece minor characters Pet Sounds Marilyn Monroe Meijer Late Night with Conan O'Brien Aldi W.

how far in advance is it appropriate to send party inviations i'm referring particularly to children's birthday parties what's the rule of thumb thanks if you're inviting people from out of town you have to give them enough time to make travel arrangements so at least six weeks for that if you're just inviting the other kids in the class then two to three weeks is appropriate so the parents have time to plan but not so far in advance they forget  Birthday Jeopardy!

are different cultures in america really trying to blend together i am asking this question because i consider myself an american eventhough i am of multiculteral decent i see and hear blacks refering to themselves as african americans polish refering to themselves as polish americans mexicans refering to themselves as mexican americans etc is this truely how we see ourselves or is this the way that certain groups perpetuate the racism that seems to be growing at an alarming rate in this country as i see it if we continue to segregate ourselves culturaly we will never acheive the racial harmony we all claim we want whats your oppinion although i believe we do need to reach a certain amount of harmony among races i do not think that people should give up their cultural heritage altogether america is unique in that we have the opportunity to learn so much about nearly every culture in the world we need to take advantage of this opportunity and not shove it away in the name of blending together the way to racial harmony is through acceptance the way to acceptance is through education in order to achieve racial peace each community needs to take on the responsibility of education more events such as cultural fairs and the like should take place only through education are we ever going to see racial harmony  Affirmative action Hispanic African American Race (U.S. Census) Racial segregation Music genre Brown v.
