best brand desktop out there alienware would be the uber of haxor dell and hps should be alright best results would come from an experienced custom build though because you can choose combinations of parts that would not be commercially available for example its hard to find an amd machine without and ati based graphics solution because the two are produced by the same company the next desktop i buy is going to be the one i build myself  ATI Technologies IBM PC compatible NVIDIA Stardock Sun Microsystems Laptop Hewlett-Packard IMac Windows XP Apple Macintosh Alienware AMD CPU design Mac OS X Desktop computer VIA Technologies Microprocessor Microsoft Windows Windows Vista Radeon Atari ST Silicon Graphics Computer Compaq History of Microsoft Windows History of the graphical user interface OpenGL X Window System Power Macintosh G3 GeForce 6 Series Personal computer Dual-core EMachines Dell, Inc.

building a desktop computer or buying a desktop computer what will be the cheapest and best way to go what ill like in a desktop is the best of everything when building a desktop how do i know what brand names are the best to use if i buy a brand name desktop with the best of everything in it will the price be same by building it if buying a brand name desktop what will be the best brand to buy what sites are the best to buy computer parts if i do build this will be my first time building what will all i need when building a desktop computer is there any sites to learn more about desktop computers and building them money aint a problem i just want to get my money worth and not get rip off i m sorry for all these questions if i m helped thanks for helping me hello building a pc is fun and exciting and a great way to learn more about the machine too you can research what motherboards work best with what components or you can just slap anything together the difference will be a machine that works with synergy the sum of the parts working efficiently together to make a whole it can be simple or as complicated as you want it to be it's true that building a pc is cheaper than buying one but it's time consuming and if you're willing to take the time and read and learn then i believe you can build a system for about and today the monitors are cheaper than they were in the past and that was our biggest expense here's some websites to check out www tomshardware com for technical issues for lowest prices go to www pricewatch com they list items you're looking for in lowest price first order including shipping and they're generally rated so you know if you'd feel better paying say one dollar more for a store that's got a better reputation or rating in using pricewatch there was one store that consistantly came out in almost all my searches www newegg com with www directron com www digi me com two close seconds i think you'll enjoy yourself here to start you might want to get a bare bones system and add to it as you can afford stay away from integrated video onboard and shared ram systems i'll also leave you with this piece of advice a kick ass video card and ample ram is far better than spending top dollar on the fastest cpu get yourself a reasonably priced motherboard with plenty of pci slots and can handle a good amount of ram for future use a good video card with it's own vram and maybe the second or third fastest cpu if the motherboard can handle the top of the line cpu there's room for upgrade when the top cpu is no longer top i have a friend who's got way more time than me but he builds a system about once every six months sells his old one old is six months old for him and he stays current and the cost is cheap because he's building a nice system that still brings good money six monthsdown the road if you've got the time it's a great way to keep your pc almost the newest best there is without spending a lot of course it takes some kicking around money because there's some time between your building the new one to selling the older one best of luck and enjoy marcos  Personal computer Computer ATI Technologies IBM PC compatible CPU design Windows XP Atari ST Overclocking IMac Commodore 64 Computer bus RISC Laptop CPU cache ZX Spectrum Power Macintosh G3 Redundant array of independent disks Amiga PlayStation 2 Atari 8-bit family PowerPC Hard disk Floppy disk Wintel AMD 3dfx Desktop computer Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Commodore International NeXT INMOS Transputer Cyrix Apple IIGS 64-bit Universal Serial Bus Nintendo Microeconomics Embedded system Arbitrage Windows Vista Windows 2000 Motherboard Digital photography History of Microsoft Windows Microsoft Mac OS X PostScript Graphics processing unit MOS Technology 6502 Commodore 128 Athlon IBM PC Microsoft Windows AmigaOS Texas Instruments TI-99/4A FairTax IPod Supercomputer Celeron Amstrad CPC PC motherboard Gross domestic product Compiler optimization X Window System Inflation Hydrogen economy MMORPG Computer workstation $ale of the Century Mach kernel Home computer GeForce 6 Series Sears Holdings Corporation Computer hardware Tax Original Amiga chipset TRS-80 Color Computer Wal-Mart Commodore PET NVIDIA Opteron Wheel of Fortune MOS Technology Atari 2600

computer help again ok i thought that the last question i asked fixed my comp but apparently not ok here's the deal for some reason my computer will sometimes shut down and not be able to turn back on it's almost like it goes in sleep mode but i can't wake it up i have to unplug it and replug it back in i have avg antivirus and i've scanned it and it says nothings wrong any ideas that can help thanks in advance i was going to say the same as above with regards to power supply or heat issues and the above is good but also check in the bios with regards to settings on temperature as there is a setting in most bios's that allow you to make the computer shutdown at a certain temperature i would suggest you check what the max temp you can have your cpu run at and increase or lower the temp if the temp is set too low then you can obviously increase the max temp before shutdown other then that your computer has too many devices and needs a new power supply unless its a windows bug then you may need to do a windows update if that does not help open up event viewer control panel admin tools event viewer and post back with any errors relating to shutting down of the machine or powering off or power or anything that you may think is related then we can go from there if you look in system or application section of event viewer  Windows 2000 Windows XP Windows Vista Central processing unit Computer virus Temperature Linux kernel Embedded system Blue screen of death C programming language Booting Power-On Self Test Debugging IBM PC compatible RISC Redundant array of independent disks NX bit Nuclear reactor Virtual memory Microsoft Windows Apollo Guidance Computer Rootkit Btrieve CPU design Personal computer 2003 North America blackout Oscilloscope Atari 8-bit family BIOS Architecture of Windows 2000 Atari ST Windows 3.x Computer multitasking Microprocessor Apple Macintosh Computer security Turbocharger Floppy disk Linux OS/2 Mach kernel AmigaOS History of Microsoft Windows Shutdown 64-bit MIPS architecture MDAC Transistor X86 Sinclair ZX81 Visual Basic Game programming PaX X Window System Commodore 64 Password Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Apple IIGS Microsoft Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Thermostat Buffer overflow Compiler optimization Internet Explorer Plan 9 (operating system) Spacecraft propulsion Compiler Hard disk The Star Wars Holiday Special PowerPC MAME Computer Emulator Thread (computer science) Computer forensics Opera (web browser) Space shuttle main engine IMac Modem Expert system Overclocking Windows Server 2003 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Carburetor System 7 (Macintosh) Motorola 68000 Pressurized water reactor Logic Toyota Prius USB flash drive MSX Mozilla Firefox CP/M

what equipment would be good for making movies computers programs cameras i was thinking of getting a sony camera because they never really let you down any specifics what about a macintosh computer they're so much money if something were to happen to them i'd be lost in nothing also the pro only has up to gb i think witch dosn't seem like that much to store lots of things on and i've had a bad experiance with an imac but it was one of them old ones with the clear backs for a program i was thinking of final cut express the one that comes in a bundle with all them other programs remember price is an issue too thanks in advance toodles depending on how involved you want to get for the low end cheapest way refurb macmini from apple new you would also need a monitor to go w it i would suggest searching buy com and finding a nice lcd for around imovie free w apple computers i would get either a sony or a canon camera and would get a minidv format not dvd hd etc in time the hard drive cameras will be the way to go but for now minidv is readily available inexpensive and reliable no matter what computer you get i would recommend a large external hard drive gb firewire preferably to back up your projects onto final cut express is a very good program and will allow you to do much more than imovie but also is much more expensive when compared to free  IMac Apple Computer Camcorder High-definition television Floppy disk ITunes DV PlayStation 2 IPod 8 mm video format Digital photography PowerBook Hard disk Mac OS X Computer HDV IBM PC compatible FireWire Independent film USB flash drive Microeconomics Laptop EMac Personal computer Apple II family IBook Microsoft NeXT DVD MP3 Universal Serial Bus Power Mac G4 Cube Digital video Redundant array of independent disks Commodore 64 Desktop computer Energy development Mouse (computing) QuickTime PlayStation 3 Commodore International Timeline of computing 1990-forward PlayStation Portable Videotape IMovie Final Cut Pro Digital camera Atari 8-bit family Digital cinematography Bluetooth Atari ST Windows XP Xbox 360 ISight Computer and video games Stereoscopy IPod photo Sony Digital cinema Microsoft Office Power Macintosh G3 ITunes Music Store Logic VHS RISC Digital8 David Pogue Apple Lisa Spyware CPU design Windows Vista Bicycle lighting Digital circuit X Window System Nintendo Screenshot Walkman Blu-ray Disc Computer virus Macromedia Flash Virtual memory History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Data General Surveillance Pretty Good Privacy Sound Blaster Apple IIGS Pornography

how do you retire a dell service tag on a computer i bought a new dell and the old dell is no longer useable it's broke i do not want to show i have more 'useable' dells than i actually have that really sounds like a silly question the service tag appears on every model of dell computer if you have a paid contract with dell then contact dell but if this is a guarantee thing that you are worried about forget it the next owner of your old dell can use that tag to learn what software and drivers can be installed on it from the dell website so if you remove that tag you are degrading the value of that computer this is not a personal identity thing that will harm you or your credit good luck and happy computing  Spyware IBM PC compatible Dell, Inc.

what is the best way to significantly speed up my pc my pc is getting on a bit so is not as fast as it used to be and is not capable of running some of the newer programs e g pc games i need to improve it but do not have the money to get a new one although i do have enough money to buy some new hardware in english preferably it all depends on what you're going to use your computer for if it's really old you'll be better off just buying a new one but i warn you hp and all them rip you off if you want to keep your current computer then look at your options and see whether you can upgrade the most important aspects are ram cpu graphics card and hd space if you're low on it ram random access memory allows your cpu central processing unit to perform more operations in less time so basically the more ram you have the faster overall loading time will be check out this website http www crucial com systemscanner it's really helpful and tells you how many ram slots you have and the maximum which your motherboard can handle i would recommend gig at least thats if your comp can handle it cpu normally buying a new cpu can be costly and hard to put in one method which computer enthusuaits are doing nowadys is overclocking this means that they're forcing their computer to work at maximum capacity so if you have a ghz processor you can overclock to over ghz warning if you're planning to overclock chech to see whether your power supply of your computer can handle it also overclocking significantly reduces the life of your pc since your forcing it to go extra hard one big issue which people are faced with is cooling overclocking also heats up your system like hell its important to have adequate cooling if you don't listen then the consequences can include your motherboard melting which is very bad one other suggestion is buying a low range intel core duo processors and then overclocking it so that it performs at the same speed as a more expensive one however your motherboard has to be able to support the core duo processors graphics card gpu a good graphics card is essential for those who like to play games on their pc's if you want to upgrade your graphics card then you have to make sure of a couple of factors graphics cards come in three formats pci agp and the latest pci e which has the fastest speed ever gigs per second needed for those really demanding and killer games visit this website it's got facts on what graphics card will be compatible with your system there are major graphics cards makers currently ati and geforce nvidia currently the latest nvidia card is the gtx ultra which costs a lot p s that graphics card will last you for a long time depending on what sort of gaming your into different graphics cards will suit your needs so there you go mate a quick in my view overview of what you should do  Pentium M Commodore 64 Microprocessor PlayStation Portable Opteron Hard disk CDC 6600 MIPS architecture Apple II family NX bit Power Macintosh G3 NForce4 TRS-80 Color Computer PCI Express Sound Blaster Virtual memory PC Engine VIA Technologies Computer Xbox Computer bus Commodore 128 Mainframe computer Amiga Apple IIGS PlayStation 2 Front side bus Graphics card PowerBook 64-bit Windows 2000 AmigaOS Doom 3 Linux kernel Amstrad CPC Acorn Electron INMOS Transputer Universal Serial Bus History of Microsoft Windows Laptop Timeline of computing 1990-forward VIA C3 Motorola 68000 Sega Dreamcast DDR2 SDRAM Data General Nova Mach kernel Supercomputer NeXT Shader X86 EMac Counter-Strike GeForce Cell (microprocessor) Expansion card Windows 3.x Cray-1 Game programming OpenGL Computer workstation

what should i upgrade next on my computer alright here are my specs my processor is an amd dual core i have gigs of ram gigs of hardrive space left my graphics card is a sapphire x xt mb pcie now according to my vista score my processor gets a and it is the lowest score but i don't want to base my upgrade on just vista i have two slots of dual memory channel left and my processor slot is am my computer's model is an hp a n with a thermaltake purepower express watt power supply that is soley for the graphics card i want to turn my computer into a gaming rig as of now i can run most games at max to med settings i don't want to upgrade if i wont see at least a fps increase i really dont want to change my motherboard and seeing as it only has one pcie slot i cant go crossfire or sli i really dont plan on upgrading the graphics card for some time as i just got it and it does wonders for me the psu is made just for the graphic cards and all it provides is two v at so im good there i have another psu for the acutual computer to be honest that's a pretty sturdy gaming rig you've got there the cpu would probably be the first thing i'd upgrade if you've got cash to burn the amd x only costs about www pricegrabber co uk and will give you a good performance boost you might be able to overclock the one you've already got if you improve the cooling but this does come with risks the next thing would be the graphics card the x xt was one of the best dx cards out there but it's about a year old now and all the talk is about dx direct x compatible cards being the future of gaming however the only dx game right now is lost planet and that game really isn't anything special so until they start releasing decent dx or even dx only games i'd save you money and wait for the price on dx cards to drop so cards like the gtx ultra which will never run with a w psu which cost well over are probably a waste of money right now if you're serious about gaming you might want to consider getting two identical hdds and running them in a raid configuration this turns the two drives into one with double the data transfer rate and before someone flames me they don't need to be identical it's just easier more ram is always good but gb should be adequate for your needs as you start upgrading your cpu and graphics cards your system will require more power so a more powerful psu will be needed i always recommend buying bigger than you need as stressing your psu by running it close to max power output will cause it to fail sooner rather than later and they can take all sorts of things down with them when they go i really hope that all this helps you out good luck upgrading and happy gaming  ATI Technologies Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Atari 8-bit family CPU cache Apple Macintosh CPU design RISC Microprocessor Windows XP PC motherboard Amiga Pentium 4 Windows Vista 3dfx Redundant array of independent disks IBM PC Athlon PC Engine Opteron AMD Laptop MIPS architecture Apple IIGS Celeron PlayStation 2 Scalable Link Interface Apple II family NVIDIA Commodore 64 TRS-80 Color Computer IMac ZX Spectrum Sega Saturn Power Macintosh G3 Computer bus Hard disk NForce4 64-bit Linux kernel Nintendo Revolution MSX Nintendo 64 PowerPC Xbox 360 Data General Nova PCI Express PlayStation Portable IA-32 Timeline of computing 1990-forward GeForce 7 Series VIA Technologies Poker jargon Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Windows 2000 X86 Mac OS X Atari 2600 Amstrad CPC Cyrix Game Boy Advance Dual-core Nintendo GameCube Front side bus Mach kernel Computer and video games Xbox NX bit Microsoft Windows Floppy disk AmigaOS Computer workstation SETI@home INMOS Transputer Intellivision SAM Coup__ Computer CDC 6600 Linux System/36 Pentium M Sinclair ZX81 Accelerated Graphics Port

is it true that when you put your computer on standby mode you're wasting more energy than by leaving it on no explanation while on standby your entire computer switches to a low power state where devices such as the monitor and hard disk turn off and your computer uses less power when you want to use the computer again it comes out of standby mode quickly and your desktop is restored exactly as you left it standby is especially useful for conserving battery power in laptops warning because standby does not save your desktop state to disk a power failure while on standby mode can cause you to lose unsaved data you're working on hibernation mode saves everything in memory on disk turns off your monitor and hard disk and then turns off your computer it takes longer to bring your computer out of hibernation than out of standby standby mode is useful if you are going to be away from your computer for a short period of time minutes to a few hours put your computer in hibernation mode for extended time away or overnight when you restart your computer your desktop is restored exactly as you left it hope this answers your question  Windows XP Laptop Embedded system Hard disk Redundant array of independent disks IBM PC compatible Universal Serial Bus Personal computer Apollo Guidance Computer CPU design Macintosh Finder Mouse (computing) Atari ST Uninterruptible power supply Atari 8-bit family Apple Macintosh Computer hardware File Allocation Table Partition (computing) Amstrad CPC Commodore 64 Desktop computer Linux Computer forensics Booting Apple II family Jumpstart 3rd Grade Virtual memory 2003 North America blackout PowerPC USB flash drive Daylight saving time Screenshot Computer virus IPod Mach kernel PowerBook Digital photography Ethernet Microsoft Windows Computer bus ZX Spectrum Microprocessor History of Microsoft Windows Commodore 128 Apple IIGS Commodore International Toyota Prius Microcomputer Palm OS Bluetooth Computer multitasking Supercomputer AmigaOS Secure Digital card MS-DOS Megatron Acorn Archimedes X86 assembly language CompactFlash Dynamic random access memory Flash memory Golden Sun System/36 Forth programming language MiniDisc Apple Lisa IBM PC History of computing hardware (1960s-present) PlayStation Portable Calculator Wi-Fi PDP-11 Non-volatile memory Stereoscopy Spacecraft propulsion Architecture of Windows 2000 Windows Vista Read-only memory Context switch Vacuum tube Nuclear reactor Power Macintosh G3 Central processing unit Windows 3.x Advanced Technology Attachment Extended display identification data RISC Liquid crystal display

can you completely upgrade your computer while keeping your hard drives and os installed i have xp on my primary and other files on my slave drive i am installing a new motherboard cpu memory and video cards sli can i keep my current drives without having to start w a fresh os in theory you can and windows xp will update drivers however you would be better off backing up any important files or anything you want to keep and then wipe the hard drive or at least the partition with windows and install windows fresh because either way you still have to reactivate your copy of windows because of major hardware changes  Windows 2000 Personal computer Microsoft Windows Linux Windows Vista AmigaOS Knoppix History of Microsoft Windows ATI Technologies IMac Apple IIGS Apple Macintosh Windows 3.x Booting Virtual memory IBM PC compatible Partition (computing) Hard disk BIOS Amiga IPod Commodore 64 Windows Me DOS File Allocation Table Disk cloning Computer Redundant array of independent disks Mac OS X Computer hardware Atari ST 64-bit Creative Zen System 7 (Macintosh) Modchip Object Desktop Xbox File system Floppy disk PlayStation 2 Scalable Link Interface Commodore PET IBM PC ZX Spectrum NTFS Btrieve 3dfx CPU cache Advanced Technology Attachment Computer forensics MS-DOS Apple II family Universal Serial Bus Windows Server 2003 NX bit USB flash drive Computer bus GeForce 6 Series Blue screen of death Mach kernel TRS-80 Color Computer DragonFly BSD Power Macintosh G3 Mandriva Linux QuickTime Commodore 128 PlayStation 3 DirectX Atari 8-bit family Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis NForce4 OpenBSD ITunes Graphics processing unit History of operating systems Copy protection FreeDOS Spyware Flash memory Overclocking Macintosh Finder Computer storage MSN Messenger LiveCD DR-DOS PC motherboard BBC Micro PlayStation Portable Steam (content delivery) Fritz-chip MAME PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Sound card Windows 95 IBook USB mass storage device class

please suggest a solution for this computer problem when i switch on my computer there is light in the mouse and a beep sound as if the windows is starting to load but suddenly the light in the mouse goes and computer does not start i keep waiting for a few minutes and again press the button on my cpu and the computer starts when i repeat this process for three or four times what problem does it have and how can i correct it there could be a number of reasons why this is occurring first make sure your mouse and keyboard are plugged in snugly also make sure your power chord is in good and tight after you turn on your pc see if any lights blink from your keyboard and mouse and put your hand behind the back of your pc by your power supply fan to make sure you feel the fan is working your power supply or other might be bad if you have another mouse and keyboard try swapping them out just to see if that helps you could try booting up in window's safe mode by pressing your f key right after you power on your computer and before windows starts if your pc runs okay in safe mode it could be a driver issue with your mouse or other device lastly if you click on your start button then right click on my computer then click properties then click device manager then click hardware look at your keyboards and mice settings to make sure the settings look okay i hope some of this helps  Mouse (computing) Windows 2000 Microsoft Windows AmigaOS Windows XP Universal Serial Bus IBM PC compatible Embedded system Personal computer Sega Dreamcast X Window System Screenshot Thread (computer science) Atari 8-bit family IMac CPU design Apple Macintosh Atari ST ZX Spectrum Virtual memory Computer multitasking Game controller Upper Memory Area RISC Windows 3.x Blue screen of death Commodore 64 History of Microsoft Windows Ethernet Computer History of the graphical user interface Nintendo Entertainment System Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Control Panel (Windows) Computer and video games Apple Computer Central processing unit Linux X10 (industry standard) Object Desktop Redundant array of independent disks Architecture of Windows 2000 USB flash drive KIM-1 Modem Kernel (computer science) Xerox Alto Hello world program Cheating in Counter-Strike Commodore 128 Power-On Self Test Desktop computer Windows Vista Computer keyboard Unicode Toyota Prius Jumpstart 3rd Grade Opera (web browser) Device driver System/34 Digital Amstrad CPC Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Double-click (computing) Control-Alt-Delete OS/2 PlayStation Portable Spyware PowerPC Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster SAM Coup__ Apple IIGS TRS-80 CPU cache Minesweeper (computer game) Apollo Guidance Computer Super Nintendo Entertainment System PDP-11 Compiler optimization System/36 64-bit Sinclair ZX81 NX bit Keyboard technology Computer and video game genres Floppy disk GunZ The Duel Computer terminal Enigma machine Apple Desktop Bus Xerox Star Keyboard layout 2000 Australian Grand Prix Advanced Technology Attachment Palm OS

my computer is slow do know how to make it faster please help me hello peter it'd be helpful if i knew more about your computer but going on this question blind i'll tell you there's generally three things that attribute to slowing down a computers performance integrated video with shared ram this sort of integration takes power away from the cpu and becuase of it's place on the motherboard has a slow data path so your video is slow making the pc slow these sort of systems also have shared ram and that takes essential resources away from the system how to solve this buy a dedicated video card with its own video ram the type of card you will need will depend on your motherboard insufficient ram next to video card the next important issue for any pc is making certain it's got enough ram to operate efficiently again this depends upon a number of factors and begins with what os operating system you're using a pc with xp works very well with mb ram processor depending on your motherboard there may be room for improvement by upgrading your cpu i'd say this is the least important factor in speeding up your system and is often not worth the cost unless your system is old enough so the cpus are cheap i once upgraded a p system from a mhz chip to mhz for only so to me it was worth it it was an old dell system and i increased the ram from to mb along with a nvidia x agp video card this brought my old dying dell up to speed and made it faster than many newer systems coming out of the mega stores even three years later i hope this has given you some insight if you have more specific questions about your specific machine i'd be happy to answer them my email is open ciao marcos  RISC Central processing unit Overclocking PowerPC ATI Technologies Personal computer IBM PC compatible CPU cache Apple Macintosh Computer Opteron Atari ST PlayStation 3 CPU design Athlon NVIDIA 3dfx Northbridge (computing) Graphics processing unit Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis AMD IMac Commodore 128 Power Macintosh G3 Acorn Computers PlayStation 2 Windows XP Redundant array of independent disks PC motherboard Front side bus TRS-80 Color Computer Cyrix Commodore 64 Apple IIGS Apple II family IBM PC Microprogram Atari 8-bit family Motherboard Accelerated Graphics Port Amiga Celeron Compiler optimization Windows 2000 Random access memory VIA Technologies Radeon BBC Micro Microprocessor Super Nintendo Entertainment System Hard disk 64-bit PC Engine Laptop AmigaOS Data General Nova MOS Technology 6502 Atari 2600 MSX MIPS architecture USB flash drive Amstrad CPC Cray-1 Desktop computer Mach kernel Mainframe computer Acorn Electron Moore's law Stream processing Dual-core Sinclair ZX81 Risc PC Distributed computing Capacitor plague Commodore PET EMac Read-only memory PowerBook DDR2 SDRAM History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Timeline of computing 1990-forward Nintendo GameCube Computer architecture History of Microsoft Windows Neo-Geo Thread (computer science) Motorola 68000 SIMD

what is the biggest gig processor available for a desktop computer please list the gig not the number like etc what do you mean the gig the ghz rating between amd processors and intel processors isn't the same and doesn't tell you much since the newer chips run at lower clockspeeds but are more efficient for amd processors the number before the plus sign like is what tells you how fast they perform relative to older pentium chips with the newer intel chips you have to look at model numbers like e e the days when just the ghz rating tells you how fast a processor runs are looong gone you'd have to check benchmarks to see how they really perform for example amd's x runs at ghz but it's way faster than a ghz pentium d the rating means it runs slightly faster than a ghz pentium d the intel core duo runs at ghz but it's even faster than amd's x processor now that said i think the fastest desktop processor is the intel core duo e which runs at a stock speed of ghz but of course people overclock it higher the quad cores are for workstations and servers  Opteron Overclocking AMD RISC Pentium III Microprocessor PowerPC Pentium Pentium D PR rating VIA C3 CPU design CPU cache Pentium Pro IA-32 Athlon 64 64-bit Cyrix AMD64 Clock rate Computer workstation MIPS architecture X86 AMD 5x86 Pentium II Windows XP Dual-core Central processing unit Transmeta IBM PC compatible NX bit AMD K6-III Symmetric multiprocessing Laptop DEC Alpha Benchmark (computing) AMD K6-2 Radeon Cell (microprocessor) Wintel CPU electrical consumption AltiVec Intel History of Microsoft Windows AMD K6 HyperTransport Mac OS Northbridge (computing) ThinkPad AMD K5 Intel 80486 IA-64 Linux kernel MOS Technology 6502 Silicon Graphics Personal computer Mac OS X Novell NetWare Itanium 2 Athlon 64 X2 GeForce 6 Series ATI Technologies Bluetooth SGI Visual Workstation Intel i860 Duron Montecito Timeline of computing 1990-forward Computer Sun Microsystems Moore's law Operating system PlayStation 3 Branch predictor Am386 VIA Technologies DDR2 SDRAM Conroe 3dfx Power Mac G5 Cisco PIX IMac PDP-11

my computer wont work when i turn it on it wont go past the gateway screen help when i turn it on it wont go past the gateway screen and i tried leaving it on for hours and it still wont go past the gateway screen sounds like a file from the operating system might be corrupted either that or you picked up some sort of boot virus can you further evaluate how long have you left the computer on before giving up and trying to re boot again also try to see if you can get into your operating system using safe mode pressing f right at boot up if you can see if you can run your virus scanner update it definitely sounds like you have a corrupt boot file this unfortunately means you will have to reinstall the operating system of whatever you are using xp vista etc if you can't get into windows in safe mode as i mentioned above then there is no other way around this but let me know if you can and email me again remember press f right when the computer starts booting  Computer virus Microsoft Windows Blue screen of death Windows 2000 Anti-virus software Booting Partition (computing) Windows 95 Spyware Linux Windows Server 2003 Malware IBM PC compatible OS/2 Rootkit File system Windows Me History of Microsoft Windows Windows 3.x DOS Screenshot BIOS Emacs Apple Macintosh USB flash drive E-mail IA-32 File Allocation Table NX bit Apple IIGS Operating system IPod Microsoft History of the graphical user interface Control Panel (Windows) Mouse (computing) Embedded system NTLDR PlayStation Portable Virtual memory Mac OS X v10.4 IA-64 Computer security MS-DOS Knoppix Common criticisms of Microsoft Filename extension System 7 (Macintosh) Device driver Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Kernel (computer science) Pixel Computer forensics Portable Document Format Novell NetWare HyperCard Personal computer Dual boot Mydoom Windows registry DragonFly BSD C programming language 64-bit Btrieve Hard disk Commodore International Forth programming language Bluetooth Trojan horse (computing) FidoNet Apple Computer X Window System Upper Memory Area Bulletin board system File format Desktop computer COMMAND.COM LiveCD Atari 8-bit family Spam (electronic) Palm OS Bootable business card Macintosh Finder Digital photography SAM Coup__ Stopping e-mail abuse L4 microkernel family Redundant array of independent disks G-Man (Half-Life) Outlook Express FreeDOS Atari ST PC-DOS Trusted computing

can i run windows xp and vista on the same computer yes in fact that's called a dualboot it's where the hard drive is partitioned into two or more sections where an operating system can be installed on the separate sections so first use a partition manager like one made by norton or you can just use one the windows installer disc anyway partition it up into two sections and imo give the bigger section for vista all right now the critical part remember to install xp first on the smaller part if you made said part smaller thats the important thing to remember xp first after that install vista on the second section and the vista bootmanager will recognize xp and make the boot screen where when you start the computer a screen will ask whether to run vista or an older version of windows you can change that to saying just windows xp but that's another thing so do that and you're done  Windows XP Microsoft Windows Partition (computing) Windows 2000 IBM PC compatible File system Booting Windows Vista DOS File Allocation Table Knoppix NTFS Linux Windows Server 2003 USB flash drive AmigaOS DragonFly BSD MS-DOS Dual boot Virtual memory Computer virus Disk cloning Windows 3.x History of the graphical user interface FreeDOS System 7 (Macintosh) Apple Macintosh Hard disk Kernel (computer science) Ghost (software) Operating system LiveCD DirectX Mac OS X Windows 95 Windows API Drive letter assignment PlayStation 2 Microsoft NTLDR Macintosh Finder X Window System IPod Portable Document Format Quicksort Redundant array of independent disks Emacs Internet Explorer Btrieve Atari ST Comparison of file systems Fritz-chip BIOS Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Windows registry Apple II family Windows Me NeXT HP-UX Xbox NX bit GNOME OpenGL ReactOS Copy protection WindowBlinds Puppy Linux Mandriva Linux Modchip Rootkit Floppy disk Library (computer science) Visual Basic Stardock OS/2 SUSE Linux Riemann integral Modem Macromedia Flash X86 DOS Comparison Object Desktop QuickTime MIPS architecture DR-DOS Mach kernel Graphical Environment Manager Windows Media Player Hello world program Laptop Apple Computer Computer forensics MAME Sega Dreamcast Fdisk Mac OS history IA-32 Amiga Blue Gene

changing a motherboard hi i have iqon desktop pc and it it has a intel celeron processor mb ram what would you suggest the best way to speed it up a bit would i be able to put a higher processor in or have to change the motherboard and it is easy enougth to do yourself not so confident at changing the motherboard now as it sounds a bit complicated for me but i know how to change the ram so probably will do that how do i check what the highest processor i can put in thanks if you change the motherboard then you will invalidate your copy of windows cos it's oem it's registered to that specific motherboard and will detect that it has changed basically locking your copy of windows so don't change the mobo adding ram or changing the cpu are the best ways of speeding up the performance of your computer but the best way to improve general usage is to reduce the amount of stuff that starts up with windows goto www download com and search for startup inspector a free piece of software which 'switches on and off' software that starts with widows which may be hogging your systems resources and slowing down your experience for more support email support fixitpcs com  Microprocessor Windows XP Central processing unit CPU design Pentium 4 AMD IBM PC compatible RISC Commodore 64 Windows 2000 CPU cache Windows Vista Celeron Personal computer ATI Technologies NVIDIA 64-bit X86 assembly language Motherboard MIPS architecture Overclocking Redundant array of independent disks Virtual memory Sound Blaster Apple II family MOS Technology 6502 PC motherboard Atari ST Linux Computer virus Commodore 128 ZX Spectrum History of Microsoft Windows Timeline of computing 1990-forward Microsoft Windows AMD64 X86 Windows 3.x Cyrix AmigaOS NX bit PowerPC Mac OS X Northbridge (computing) Apple IIGS Apple Intel transition Apple Computer Motorola 68000 Mach kernel Embedded system Intel iAPX 432 System 7 (Macintosh) Wintel Pentium D Apple Macintosh Computer Mozilla Firefox INMOS Transputer MSX Amstrad CPC Graphics processing unit TRS-80 Color Computer Pentium M GeForce 6 Series Object Desktop Mac OS X v10.4 Booting PDP-11 PlayStation 3 Mandriva Linux MS-DOS Library (computer science) Computer bus Compiler optimization Athlon Linux kernel History of operating systems Desktop computer IMac Microprogram Mac OS X Window System Thread (computer science) Web crawler DR-DOS IA-32 Amiga Pretty Good Privacy Microcontroller Cray-1 Supercomputer DEC Alpha Ethernet Mainframe computer

two pc questions can anyone recommend a quality x agp graphics card how do you know when it's time to upgrade your sound card hello i'll answer the second question first it's time to upgrade your sound card when you hear a funny sound coming from it like i did with mine my cooling fan was shot on my now ancient nvidia tnt video card with a whopping mb vram if you've got a amd based system ati may work better because they're basically owned by amd it's one company now another reason your pc is at the edge of the minimum qualifications for running a game you like i had an older dell dimension and i replaced it with a nividia geforce xt x agp card still not a screaming card by then or now standards but being a decent average user card it had only cost me and breathed new life into my system and extended its' lifespan it was a lot cheaper than buying a new piece of crap pc out of walmart with integrated video and shared ram the first question would depend on the system you currently have but any of nvidia or ati's agp cards in that area would be fine i think the x cards are backward compatible but don't take that as gospel as long as it says it's x compatible you won't be wasting your money my ghz p processor machine was faster than many of the newer bargain basement pc's coming out at twice that speed because of the ram and agp card i had installed the least important of the three things that'll slow a system down is the cpu most important i feel is the video card with it's own video ram http www newegg com product productlist aspx submit ene depa description x agp card by the way that's a link to a very good price on a decent card i hope this helped marcos  Radeon 3dfx PlayStation 3 IMac AMD Personal computer GeForce 4 PC motherboard GeForce FX Overclocking Apple Macintosh Atari ST Xbox Graphics processing unit VIA Technologies Windows Vista Doom 3 Windows XP Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Commodore 64 Power Macintosh G3 Graphics card Sega Saturn Timeline of computing 1990-forward Counter-Strike Xbox 360 Computer bus PowerPC DDR2 SDRAM TRS-80 Color Computer History of Microsoft Windows Far Cry Accelerated Graphics Port PowerBook Commodore 128 GeForce 2 Amstrad CPC Computer PlayStation 2 Pentium 4 IBM PC Apple II family Apple IIGS Laptop Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic MSX Sega Dreamcast Windows 2000 NForce2 Mac OS X GeForce 7 Series PCI Express Opteron Microprocessor Computer workstation Windows 3.x Mainframe computer ZX Spectrum Nintendo Northbridge (computing) Nintendo Entertainment System OpenGL Radeon X Series Microsoft Windows Linux Super Nintendo Entertainment System 64-bit GeForce 3 Commodore International Floppy disk Mac mini PC Engine RISC Cyrix Supercomputer MAME Celeron SAM Coup__ Athlon GeForce 256 Wintel TRS-80 In The Groove (game) AMD64 IA-32 Acorn Computers

what are some things i can do to speed up my computer it takes forever to load almost anything you can try free programs like ccleaner or atf cleaner i prefer the latter there probably are a bunch of junk files that slow down your computer next you can type msconfig in run and uncheck all the items you don't need to run oon startup you might have spyware on your computer try spybot search and destroy to get rid of it all if it is still slow after all this you might need more ram it's not too expensive  Spyware Computer virus Virtual memory Windows registry Linked list Malware Commodore 64 File sharing Windows XP AmigaOS Random access memory IBM PC compatible Atari 8-bit family Host file CPU cache C programming language Portable Document Format Electric motor Launchd Apple II family Library (computer science) Read-only memory Computer security Kazaa USB flash drive Emacs Screenshot Windows 3.x BASIC programming language Internet security TRS-80 Color Computer Adware CPU design RISC System/36 Warez Perl Mac OS X Hybrid vehicle Computer cluster Computer file System 7 (Macintosh) NeXT Mach kernel World of Warcraft Data General Nova Stopping e-mail abuse Macintosh Finder System/34 Computer Universal Serial Bus Hard disk Computer and video games Embedded system Apple IIGS Upper Memory Area Starsiege: Tribes Booting Trusted computing Commodore DOS Acorn Electron Forth programming language Hash table MDAC Grand Theft Auto (game) Toyota Prius Diablo II: Lord of Destruction 64-bit Software patent debate Spam (electronic) System 6 Apple Macintosh Mainframe computer Hierarchical File System Trojan horse (computing) Redundant array of independent disks Algorithm Microprogram PaX Computer software Jet engine CDC 6600 Sun Microsystems OpenOffice.org Database DOS Blue screen of death Sinclair ZX81 Fritz-chip ZX Spectrum USS Tunny (SS-282) Arbitrage Memory (computers) TransUnion Overclocking Rootkit Compiler optimization

wots apning all of a sudden out of the blue my pc keeps making a lot of noise ever heard a up real close preparing for take off wtf never did this before only if lots of progs running at the same time any tips really starting to bug me now p s i'm a real generous guy i'll give for remedy i suspect the noise is most likely coming from the fan on your cpu processor as it seems to happen when lots of programmes are running it means the cpu is working harder and generating more heat and so the fan spins faster to keep the cpu cool if you open up your computers case with the power cord unplugged at the mains you will probably find that the cpu fan is caked in dust if it is then you will probably have found the culprit i can't guarantee that the remedy will work as the fan may already be damaged in which case you will need a new fan however i've done this for friends with a similar problem many times with about a success rate very carefully remove as much of the dust as you can with a vacuum cleaner with the smallest nozzle you have preferably a plastic one and try not to touch anything on the motherboard next before closing up the case plug the mains back in and test the machine with luck the noise will have significantly reduced if not then on to stage unplug from the mains again and carefully unscrew the fan from the heatsink below it which itself will probably have dust clogged between its fins again use the vacuum cleaner and a new clean paintbrush to dislodge the stubborn stuff once you're happy you've removed all you can from from the heatsink use the brush on the fan to get even more muck off of it screw the fan back in place and test again if that doesn't do it then i'm afraid stage involves spending money unless you have installed a heatsink and fan before then you would be best to take your computer to a local computer shop not high street chains or pc world as a chimp at the zoo could do a better job and get them to fit a new heat sink and fan for you  Overclocking Central processing unit CPU cooling Commodore 64 CPU design Computer cooling Heat sink Hard disk RISC Carburetor Drill bit CPU cache Vacuum cleaner Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Jet engine Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Cray-1 BS 1363 Bong IBM PC compatible Thermal power station Nintendo Entertainment System Atari 8-bit family Mach kernel Computer bus Internal ballistics Personal computer Universal Serial Bus Dry cleaning Computer Sinclair ZX81 Electric motor Computer multitasking Circuit breaker Microprocessor IPod Northbridge (computing) Mouse (computing) Spark plug Embedded system Capacitor plague Cathode ray tube Vacuum tube Diesel engine Coffee CDC 6600 W.

can any one give me a suggestion on the following configuration that i am going to build intel core duo e intel ggcr desktop motherboard gbddr sdram gb mb buffer harddisk atx iball grabit cabinet sony dvd r w optical drive if you are going to run windows xp or vista then at the very least you are strongly advised to get at least gb of ram preferably ddr with a speed of at least mhz there are many excellent brands of memory but you need to ensure compatibility to your mother board chiefly a voltage tolerance issue usually the motherboard manufacturer or memory manufacturer will provide this info on their website or via email communication if you are going to do a lot of gaming then cooling overclocking and stability will be even more crucial issues for you excellent performance brands are ocz corsair geil crucial kingston patriot another primary area of concern is a quality power supply psu many people spend loads of cash on other components and neglect what is essentially the heart of the system your psu should have a decent output capacity of around watts and preferably dual or triple v rails among trusted well reviewed brands are antec smartpower ultra x or x thermaltake purepower the default cpu cooler heatsink that comes with the core duo is also not very highly regarded so seriously consider upgrading to a quality heatsink cooler combo such as the thermaltake big typhoon or the zalman cnps you may also want to consider getting dedicated fans mm or mm i like the antec ones for both your hd and dvd drives i am a bit fanatical about cooling which also impacts your selection of case design but not everyone share this perspective i noticed that you did not include a dedicated video card this is a must with at least mb dedicated video ram for a windows vista system and given your choice of a quad core x core duo processor i am not sure why you would skim here and share your system ram and cpu processor with an integrated graphics chip but you didn't state what your main usage would be or what os you would be running under so it's difficult to advise you on this issue if you are into gaming or hdtv hi def video then the newer cards from ati and nvidia maybe the way to go but based on the reviews for these poorly written drives and weak performances it may be more appropriate to get the older cheaper dx cards and wait for better implementation the xfx nvidia geforce gs or gs offer excellent value but if there are compatibility issues with the intel motherboard then consider sapphire asus readon xt from what i have read it may also be a good idea to look for a video card that support dual dvi output retail versions of these cards with mb on board ddr ddr are available from zipzoomfly com or newegg com for between us to us though i prefer seagate for its long year warranty most of the newer sata drives including hitachi toshiba and western digital seem to be quite stable however keep in mind that a hd can fail at any time without warning particularly after the warranty period is over so take periodic backups a good idea if you can afford it and your motherboard supports it is to activate raid and install an additional hd this mirrors your boot drive to the second drive and in the event there is a system disk failure you'll still have a fully functioning system from a system safety perspective it is always a good idea to have a quality ups that also functions as a voltage regulator this prevents data corruption and minimizes or eliminates the impact of brown outs power surges and power cuts a unit like the apc bx or ultra va us tigerdirect com would be suitable for your system configuration you also didn't mention a monitor if looking at lcd's the digital dell se wfp and the samsung w are good starting points which will cost around us besides the above the only additional suggestion is to be a bit leery of using a sony dvd optical drive they are known to be very finicky there are number of other very good alternatives such as lg plextor hp pioneer and samsung but this selection can be based on a very personal preference just do a bit of research on your model before making a final choice sony's cd r media however is quite outstanding imho providing excellent clarity and hf definition for dvd recording media verbatim is highly regarded as the most stable and compatible hopefully you will find some of this info useful enjoy your new system

buying a computer help hi i am supposed to be buying a computer for work unfortunately i don't really know what i am looking for i tried to build one on dell but i ended up confusing myself so if anyone has a minute and could help me out i'd be very grateful the requirement i need are ghz processor mb ram gig hard drive k modem mbps ethernet nerwork card and a mb zip or flash drive thanks my suggestion would be to build one but i'm not sure of your computer expertise if you are looking for a system then there are some relatively cheap systems that fit your needs see link below the only thing is that a zip drive is not going to come standard with almost any modern system so you'll need to buy one they are relatively inexpensive though and any local computer shop could sell you one as well as install it  IMac IBook USB flash drive Personal computer Laptop Commodore 64 Floppy disk PlayStation 3 PlayStation 2 PowerPC IBM PC compatible Apple Macintosh Mac mini Apple II family Ethernet Overclocking Binary prefix Booting Nintendo Revolution Modem Computer hardware The Sims 2 Apple Newton Hard disk Windows XP Desktop computer Computer ThinkPad Redundant array of independent disks Copy protection Wi-Fi Sharp Zaurus Atari 8-bit family Sega Saturn Apple IIGS Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Computer bus PC Engine Xserve IBM PC Xerox Star CompactFlash Universal Serial Bus Digital Subscriber Line Atari ST MAME Windows 2000 Embedded system Random access memory Timeline of computing 1990-forward Symbolics AirPort Windows Vista Zip drive Computer and video games Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo GameCube History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Amiga ZX Spectrum Commodore International Xbox 360 NeXT TRS-80 Color Computer Sega Dreamcast TiVo Wireless LAN PowerBook IBM Personal System/2 Linux EMac WiMAX Microcontroller Atari 2600 64-bit MSX System/36 IPod Kaypro Acorn Computers IEEE 802.11 IBM Amstrad CPC AmigaOS Gigabyte Windows XP Media Center Edition Windows 3.x PC motherboard Computer network IPAQ Secure Digital card Computing Sound Blaster Surveillance History of computer and video games Doom 3 Digital Equipment Corporation Mainframe computer

why wont my computer stay on my computer will sometimes turn on but only for about seconds it will go to the boot up screen where i have choices of how to start it but it never stays on long enough for me to figure anything out also when i go to turn it on it will only work once in awhile what is the problem how can i fix it i haven't added anything to it it will shut off no noises or anything and no it doesn't get past the boot up screen it sounds like a memory issue if you have the resources try replacing your memory with different modules and see if that fixes your problem make sure to read up on your motherboard to make sure that it is the right memory bootup problems are very hard to debug  Booting Windows 2000 Atari 8-bit family Debugging Computer virus Atari ST Windows XP Commodore 64 AmigaOS Embedded system Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Blue screen of death ZX Spectrum DragonFly BSD Computer forensics IBM PC compatible X Window System Virtual memory Apple IIGS Nintendo Entertainment System Modchip Trusted computing SAM Coup__ Optimization (computer science) IPod System 7 (Macintosh) BIOS Hard disk Mach kernel Assembly language Commodore 128 Bootstrapping Architecture of Windows 2000 Amstrad CPC IBM PC System/36 Diablo II: Lord of Destruction PlayStation 2 Sampler (musical instrument) Computer Compiler optimization Software bug Digital photography Oscilloscope FreeDOS MiniDisc Fritz-chip MSX AMD TRS-80 X86 assembly language OpenBSD Amiga Toyota Prius Knoppix IP (complexity) Forth programming language IA-32 Cray-1 Computer bus Mouse (computing) John Titor Commodore PET Sound effect Desktop computer Tandy 1000 Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Microsoft Windows Magic number (programming) Modern naval tactics Apollo Guidance Computer Apollo 6 Advanced Technology Attachment System/34 History of Microsoft Windows Overclocking PowerBook Partition (computing) C programming language Objective-C Apple II family Redundant array of independent disks MAME Computer storage Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Quantum computer Sound Blaster Radiation hardening Sonic the Hedgehog 2 INMOS Transputer Super Mario Bros. 3 MOS Technology 6502 Year 2000 problem File Allocation Table Floppy disk Complexity classes P and NP Universal Serial Bus Video Graphics Array Computer security

what is the benifit of the integration of northbridge and memory controller in amd processors and since that what is the advantage that amd processors will take rather than intel core due by this property it basically increases the amount of bandwidth between the cpu and ram because there is no longer the bottleneck caused by having to go through the front side bus despite this advantage the core duos are still faster due to other architectural benefits  Front side bus Opteron CPU cache CPU design Pentium 4 RISC Microprocessor Athlon PC motherboard Dual-core Northbridge (computing) MIPS architecture Celeron IBM PC compatible AMD64 Sempron IA-32 PowerPC Overclocking Athlon 64 IBM PC NX bit VIA C3 Transmeta Pentium Cyrix HyperTransport NVIDIA AMD K6-III VIA Technologies Intel Symmetric multiprocessing X86 Pentium III AMD K6-2 Intel i860 GeForce 6 Series Compiler optimization Windows XP Super Nintendo Entertainment System Data General Nova Intel iAPX 432 Wintel X86 assembly language Clock rate Microprogram Cell (microprocessor) History of Microsoft Windows Computer Athlon 64 X2 Xeon Von Neumann architecture 3dfx Embedded system Word (computer science) Apple Macintosh Vector processor Motorola 68000 Linux kernel PR rating History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Microcontroller Field-programmable gate array Microsoft Windows PowerPC G4 DDR2 SDRAM Pentium D PA-RISC family Sound Blaster ATI Technologies AMD K6 Pentium II NForce4 Risc PC Intel i960 Amstrad CPC IA-64 INMOS Transputer Intel 80386 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Rambus Am386 DragonFly BSD Buffer overflow Power Mac G5 Computer bus Sequent Computer Systems Stream processing Xbox 360 Power Macintosh G3 AMD 29000 Memory-mapped I/O

i left my computer on all night when it shut down it worked just fine but when i turned it on it won't wor i just turned my computer off after it had been on all night and then i turned it on again and it won't load past the dell logo at all and this is the first time it's happened what should i do either a particular component fried possibly the processor or somehow a virus or hacker got onto your computer and really screwed things up since you see the dell logo that means the bios should have loaded successfully an operation completely independant of the processor so maybe your problem is the processor in any event depending on how computer motivated you are i would consider taking out the hard drive and scanning it for viruses on a different computer if your computer is still under warranty then have dell look at it before you open it yourself hope that helps good luck  IBM PC compatible Computer virus Windows XP Booting Floppy disk Computer security CPU cache Dell, Inc.

what are the legalities behind copying movies for your own private use it's technically illegal to make a copy of anything that is copyrighted you are supposed to go buy a copy with that said it would be pretty hard for them to prove anything most standard copying software allows you to make a single backup copy of a dvd though you can download progs to let you make as many copies as you want since you can make a backup legally you could always just say you bought a copy but it got lost stolen or damaged the only way you could really get into trouble as long as you keep your head down is if you were making multiple copies and trying to resell them then they would nail you to the wall  Warez Copyright infringement of software Digital rights management DVD Copyright infringement MAME Backup Modchip Copyright ROM image GNU General Public License Xbox SCO v.

i am a pc user and was wondering if i shud switch to a mac im a computer engineer with years of experience in the business read on if your buying a computer buy a windows pc why first pc's dominate about of the market its what the world uses apple only has about followed by linux when you ultimately go for a job which operating system do you think you'll be using you'll be at a disadvantage if you use a mac second the hardware technology curve is heavily biased towards pc's they are completely customizable and upgradeable for astonishing prices the very best hardware is available for pc's first dual core and quad core processors as well as nvidia gpu's third software availability pc's simply have more availability of software than apple period professional and gaming software companies generally write for pc's first and apple second you always hear of games being ported over to macs fourth windows is not nearly as complicated to use as people perceive i used macs years ago and simply found them different that windows machines although vista has issues because it is so new os was riddled with bugs when it came out once the patches were fixed by apple it was more acceptable just like vista will be max os also gets hit hard by viruses and malware you only hear about windows getting hit by them because the world uses pc's and the damage is on a much larger scale fifth bang for buck compare a pc to that of a mac and see what you actually get for the money since pc hardware is not owned by any one company like apple you get fierce competition for your dollar all the software you get is nothing more than a throw in the real value comes from the hardware you purchase just remember that you will get a lot of opinions on this topic but the fact of the matter is that pcs dominate the world while apple only has a fraction of it there is a learning curve to any operating system pc mac linux and each will have problems by those who dont know how to use it just make sure you do your homework before you buy any machine and make sure you do comparisons to maximize your dollar gl  Apple Macintosh Windows Vista Computer virus Windows XP Microsoft Apple Computer Mach kernel Operating system Amiga X Window System NVIDIA IMac IPod History of Microsoft Windows Radeon OpenGL Mac OS X v10.4 NeXT System 7 (Macintosh) Microsoft Office Silicon Graphics Embedded system Atari 8-bit family Mac OS Computer WordPerfect 64-bit MAME Timeline of computing 1990-forward 3dfx Commodore 64 ATI Technologies RISC PowerPC AMD Personal computer Common criticisms of Microsoft Mozilla Firefox Floppy disk PlayStation 3 History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Copy protection ZX Spectrum Supercomputer Software engineering USB flash drive PowerBook IBM Apple Intel transition PlayStation 2 Unix Digital rights management Windows 2000 Virtual memory Booting Ashton-Tate Computer and video games Modem Xbox GeForce 6 Series Internet Explorer Wintel Unicode History of operating systems Microprocessor IBook Software bug Digital Equipment Corporation MIPS architecture Mainframe computer Lisp programming language Microeconomics Spyware DOS Computer workstation ITunes Music Store Sun Microsystems OS/2 OpenBSD CPU cache MS-DOS Graphics processing unit Vorbis Central processing unit World of Warcraft VMware Stardock Mouse (computing)

is windows xp will be void i am planning to change my motherboard because one of the memory slot seems to have a problem does not detect one of my stick if i changed my mobo will i still be able to install my windows xp please dont tell me to call microsoft service center because i am in mideast and don't seem to know the answer i have mem slot but the rd slot won't detect my mushkin gb stick i tried swaping the sticks to the first sec and fourth slot but they are ok except for the rd slot i still have the xp cd activation key evrything but i also know that onced i activate my win xp over internet it will register my hardware config or save with this product key something like that so a major changes in hardware like changing motherboard will ask me to reinstall win xp so if i activate this new hardware config with the same old product key maybe it will tell me that this product key is already been activated to some pc if i call microsoft in mideast they seem not to know they said oem cannot be reused ok i could be wrong but i am almost positive that changing your motherboard will require a re install of the win xp operating system or at a minimum a reactivation of the os anytime that the os notes a major change in the system hardware such as a motherboard change it will try to do a reactivation if i remember correctly you will have up to three times after doing a major hardware change for the os to do an automatic reactivation after the third time though you will need to call microsoft to do it i don't think that there is any way to get around that as long as you have your win xp original install disk and the product key you should have no problem with your re install if you have the win xp install disk but you've lost or misplaced your product key there is a way to retrieve the product key from the system prior to doing your mobo change and os re install there are software programs that will assist you in locating the product key on your computer btw the number listed under my computer properties is not the product key that is the serial number and it will not help you in your re install if you need instructions on how to retrieve the product key shoot me an email also are you sure that it is the memory slot that is bad and not just the memory stick have you tried swapping the memory sticks around or just reinstalling them one at a time to see if the culprit is the slot or a stick it is worth trouble shooting that first  Windows XP Windows 2000 IBM PC compatible Computer virus Virtual memory Copy protection Personal computer Apple IIGS Computer Blue screen of death PlayStation 2 Amiga Apple Macintosh Windows registry PlayStation 3 BIOS Computer hardware Modem Apple II family Windows Vista Atari 8-bit family Thread (computer science) Commodore 64 Novell NetWare Operating system Windows Server 2003 TRS-80 Color Computer Booting History of Microsoft Windows Computer bus Computer forensics Nintendo Entertainment System Patch (computing) Linux C programming language Forth programming language Password Buffer overflow Spyware Computer multitasking PC motherboard Java programming language Atari ST FreeDOS Digital circuit Library (computer science) Modchip Next-Generation Secure Computing Base NX bit Kernel (computer science) Mozilla Application Suite Hard disk Partition (computing) Xbox CPU cache Digital rights management Universal Serial Bus Timeline of computing 1990-forward ZX Spectrum Disk cloning Screenshot Hash table Btrieve Emulator PDP-11 Slot machine Emacs USB flash drive Original Amiga chipset CPU design Device driver Knoppix Amstrad CPC Windows 3.x Database Palm OS Trusted computing Mozilla Firefox Page table Floppy disk Linux distribution Information Technology Infrastructure Library MSX Server History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Sorting algorithm 64-bit Perl CP/M Nintendo GameCube

what happens if i change my computer's virtual memory i have vista and gigabytes of ram which an athlon x dual core what's the worst that could happen if i changed it from it's automatic settings to mb which is the recommended amount listed also can i increase that even more for better performance whats the highest safe amount i can increase it to it may effect your performance the recommended amount is to dynamically allocate it by os the recommended manual setting is gb for gb of ram the highest safe amount is based on how much hard drive space you have and a safe cushion to create additional files depends on your applications the most you can increase it by is up to the size left on your drive not recommended the least you can have it is but then you slow your computer down if you want to improve performance best bet is to use real ram for more info http en wikipedia org wiki virtual memory  Virtual memory Windows XP CPU cache Hard disk Windows 2000 Redundant array of independent disks C programming language Random access memory File Allocation Table Knoppix History of Microsoft Windows Compiler optimization AMD Memory (computers) Embedded system RISC System 7 (Macintosh) Page table DragonFly BSD Windows Vista ZX Spectrum AmigaOS CPU design X86 Uniform Resource Locator Central processing unit USB flash drive Apollo Guidance Computer ITunes Flash memory Atari 8-bit family Athlon Pentium 4 Mac OS X Computer NTFS AMD64 Computer forensics NX bit IPod Dual-core Upper Memory Area Overclocking Mouse (computing) Library (computer science) Motorola 68000 File system Nintendo GameCube Speed limit Federal Standard 1037C Blue screen of death System/34 Laptop Fragmentation Cocoa (API) Read-only memory Linked list IBM PC compatible Backup Emacs System/36 X86 assembly language IA-32 Magnetic core memory Windows Server 2003 Mozilla Firefox Power Mac G5 PNG Jet engine Scalable Vector Graphics Sorting algorithm Digital photography Xbox 360 Front side bus Single Transferable Vote Original Amiga chipset C plus plus Buffer overflow Air traffic control ATI Technologies Partition (computing) Stream processing Sinclair ZX81 Radeon OpenGL Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Mach kernel Perl Kernel (computer science) Java programming language Microprocessor Athlon 64

how can i make my computer use more of its ram this is a little hard to explain i got a computer with gb of ram but when i run a big application like a video game the computer ends the game when gb of ram is used saying that to much physical memory was being used now i've experimented and right before the error message appears to close the game and the game is still running i open the task manager and under the performance tab only gb of ram is being used so my question is how can i make my computer use more ram maybe like gb before it shuts down the program if the rest of the ram is used to keep the computer functioning then why does the performance tab say that only of my ram is being used is there any way to conserve ram on vista like all the other answerers said enable increase your paging file virtual memory and also cancel some of the vista's memory hugging services i used this guide on disabling the services and saved about mbs of ram http www blackviper com winvista servicecfg htm oh yes and since it's vista plug in some usb memory sticks while you're playing your game vista can use that free space on the usb drives as a cache and might be able to use many of them simultaneously  Virtual memory Windows 2000 PlayStation 3 CPU cache Xbox 360 Embedded system Apple II family IBM PC compatible Windows Vista Mach kernel History of Microsoft Windows Apple Macintosh Flash memory IPod Computer Computer forensics Acorn Electron Universal Serial Bus Musical Instrument Digital Interface Atari 8-bit family ZX Spectrum Secure Digital card Nintendo GameCube Redundant array of independent disks Spring operating system Floppy disk FreeDOS Commodore 64 Gmail Sinclair ZX81 PaX Hard disk AmigaOS RISC Domain Name System Computer virus Nintendo Revolution System/34 Blue screen of death PowerPC Atari ST IMac C programming language Common Unix Printing System Timeline of computing 1990-forward System 7 (Macintosh) Cache INMOS Transputer FireWire Macintosh Finder Windows Server 2003 Page table Computer bus Laptop Federal Standard 1037C Read-only memory DragonFly BSD Xbox System/36 Software engineering Apple Computer Mouse (computing) DR-DOS Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Apple IIGS OpenGL PlayStation 2 Overclocking Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Amstrad CPC Macromedia Flash Memory management unit Mozilla Firefox Digital photography Personal computer PlayStation Portable Object Desktop Fritz-chip Google Random access memory Computer hardware Cell (microprocessor) IA-32 NX bit MSN Messenger Copy protection Linux World Wide Web

should i do a computer upgrade or not i'm a computer tech and i can build computers up with new parts or i can just buy one which one should i do and in your opinion which way would be cheaper building your own computer can turn out more expensive yet usually wields much better results and you can transfer parts should you upgrade again later on computers built by companies such as dell are going to be cheaper cause they can buy in bulk yet in my opinion the computer won't be near as good as if you selected each part yourself and built it considering you know what your doing  Outsourcing Floppy disk IBM PC compatible Spaceward, Ho!

buying a computer or build my own computer is better i want to build my own computer is it good if i build my own pc if you know what you're doing then yes it is it's sometimes cheaper too to buy your own parts and put the pc together yourself if you buy a computer with stuff you don't need then what's the point in buying it this way you can install your own programs and hardware and get everything you need but again it's only easy if you know what you're doing  IBM PC compatible Apple Macintosh Linux CPU design Thin client Mac OS X Best Buy Computer Modem AmigaOS Amiga Microsoft Windows Computer and video games System/36 64-bit Data General Wintel Central processing unit Computing Windows 2000 Microprogram Copyright infringement of software CP/M Supercomputer Commodore 64 3D computer graphics Perl Digital rights management Computer numbering formats Copy protection Motion capture Computer software Computer science Laptop History of Microsoft Windows Computer architecture Surveillance Debugging Computer chess Case modding Video game music Shader Computer program Parallel computing Computer hardware Spreadsheet Overclocking Kernel (computer science) W.

my computer won't turn on i came back from vacation only to discover my compaq presario s nx doesn't turn on every cable is plugged in thanx in advance p s i unplugged every cable and re plugged it back i think the problem is your pc's power supply it must have burned you need to change it but you must know which power supply your computer uses also make sure to buy one with enough voltage for every hardware that is plugged on your motherboard so you can decrease the possibilities to have another burned power supply you should take it to an it guy and not to a wanna be technician note never buy a cheaper power supply most of the time cheaper ones like an emachine do not last long and when they burn they most of the time burn the motherboard  Universal Serial Bus Personal computer Capacitor plague IBM PC compatible Computer hardware Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Atari ST Amiga Overclocking BS 1363 AT form factor Serial ATA ATX Advanced Technology Attachment NVIDIA ATI Technologies RS-232 IBM PC Spacecraft propulsion Reading spark plugs for racing Modem Cyrix AmigaOS Plug-and-play Nintendo Entertainment System Laptop PC motherboard Computer bus Electric power Modchip Wintel Welding Power strip Altair 8800 Carburetor Transformer Floppy disk Spark plug Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Jack plug Sound card Timeline of computing 1990-forward Computer forensics KIM-1 Motherboard Vacuum tube Diesel engine Athlon EMachines Redundant array of independent disks History of Microsoft Windows Digital photography Celeron Embedded system Password Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets IPod Central processing unit Impedance D-subminiature Action potential Capacitor Apple Desktop Bus CPU design Electricity meter Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Battery (electricity) Alcohol fuel Apple IIGS Radio controlled airplane Packard Bell DR-DOS Three-phase electric power Electric power transmission Advanced Configuration and Power Interface Computer case Microsoft Windows Wind turbine Public-key cryptography High-voltage direct current Electricity distribution Transistor Computing Electronics Computer and video games S-Video Apple Macintosh Membrane potential Power cord Gas metal arc welding Electrical wiring (UK) Ethernet Peripheral Component Interconnect Nintendo DS Switched-mode power supply IMac Nintendo GameCube

how to set color quality to bit but computer winxp only allows and bit my pc specs processor intel core duo motherboard ecs video card bit geforce fx sound card sound card memory gb you are mixing up quite a few video card measurements that i am quite sure of however you didn't use enough of them so we can guess at what you actually meant all we know is that it's a something and it's a geforce fx in this case the could refer to amount of memory onboard which indirectly affects the resolution and colors available for the video modes in your case the does usually have mb onboard memory interface size though for the 's memory interface is bit core processing width bit at a time in this case however having mb does not mean you have bit color far from it you see memory affects the resolution modes available for example let's start with the simplest bit or black and white how many bytes do you need to display it well depends on the resolution x x higher or lower let's just pick x that gives me the resolution and since each pixel is one bit divide by gives me number of bytes needed to display x in b w if i have bit color to th is so that's colors then each pixel is one byte so to display bit color at x is well x bytes about mb if you do the math if i have bit color bytes per pixel then you multiple the previous result by and you get mb of memory needed remember though bit color means each pixel now has to the nd variations of color you can't really tell the difference between the colors at bit color so it's a waste to go any higher than bit color and nobody implements color settings higher than bit  CPU cache Radeon NVIDIA ATI Technologies GeForce 6 Series Atari 8-bit family Original Amiga chipset Pixel Video Graphics Array Central processing unit Color Graphics Adapter CPU design Sinclair ZX81 Texas Instruments TMS9918 GeForce 4 Radeon X Series Graphics processing unit 3dfx Computer display standard Ethernet Raster graphics ZX Spectrum Digital Computer numbering formats RGB color model PlayStation 3 PlayStation Portable Digital photography Super Nintendo Entertainment System Commodore 64 Atari ST Apple Computer MOS Technology 6502 Redundant array of independent disks Extended display identification data DV Word (computer science) PC Engine Nintendo Entertainment System Texas Instruments TI-99/4A X86 assembly language Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis GeForce 7 Series Amstrad CPC Color depth CDC 6600 High-definition television X86 Analog-to-digital converter Chroma subsampling Musical Instrument Digital Interface Endianness TRS-80 Color Computer Amiga Dynamic random access memory Universal Serial Bus Windows Vista TRS-80 Apple Macintosh Video Apple II family Dots per inch Addressing mode Graphics card Pentium 4 Motorola 68000 Sega Saturn Mac OS X Personal computer Liquid crystal display Dither Overclocking IMac Compact disc JPEG H.264/MPEG-4 AVC GeForce 2 2D computer graphics TurboGrafx 16 Anti-aliasing JPEG 2000 Nintendo 64 IA-32 Windows 2000 PlayStation 2 File Allocation Table Atari 2600 BIOS PowerPC

multiple os's multi format partitions i want to re partition my hard drive to house multiple operating systems but my question regards the partition format for example some os are ntfs and others are fat for example is it possible to have differently formatted partitions on the same hard disk and also is it possible to repartition without losing my files yes you can have multiple partitions on the same drive formatted differently fat is generally a good default format to start with especially for different flavors of microsoft windows as it is almost universally readable writable and you can later convert fat partitions to ntfs without losing your data programs like partitionmagic make the partitioning process pretty easy  NTFS Partition (computing) File Allocation Table File system Windows 2000 Defragmentation Comparison of file systems Disk formatting MS-DOS File format Disk cloning Redundant array of independent disks Windows XP DOS Microsoft Windows AmigaOS NTLDR Ghost (software) USB mass storage device class Backup Mach kernel Floppy disk Filename extension NTFS junction point Linux Apple II family Booting History of Microsoft Windows Quicksort Fork (filesystem) Hard disk Knoppix Architecture of Windows 2000 Flash memory DragonFly BSD Universal Disk Format NX bit AS/400 Computer virus System 7 (Macintosh) Computer file XML System/36 Windows Vista Operating system Dual boot USB flash drive Portable Document Format Drive letter assignment MUMPS Hello world program Copy protection Dd (Unix) MP3 FreeDOS Library (computer science) Pretty Good Privacy Buffer overflow Visual Basic Symbolic link Enterprise content management Computer forensics ZIP (file format) Blue screen of death Btrieve Thread (computer science) HFS Plus Job Control Language Microdrive Secure Digital card RAM disk Binary and text files Common Unix Printing System Master Control Program MVS Magneto-optical drive X86 DOS Comparison Windows Server 2003 OpenVMS Data remanence Fdisk Windows Me .NET assemblies Screenshot Microsoft Binary prefix Universal Serial Bus Personal computer PaX ReiserFS Ontology (computer science) Computer storage DVD OpenOffice.org ITunes

computer help i've got kinda a slow computer but i love to play runescape however it lags really bad any suggestions using a registry cleaner can fix your computer and then make your computer faster why the reason is that there may be some regsitry errors and remnant corrupt files and temp files in your computer to cause computer slow everytime you install and uninstall software on your computer and surfing online you create junk in the computer registry over time the registry can grow to enormous proportions especially if the various programs you've installed do not do a good job of deleting and or updating it's registry entries you need to scan and clean your computer with registry cleaner to make it fast good regisry cleaner will improve your computer and internet performance dramatically there are some comparison and review of top registry cleaners http computer speed info you can download and scan your computer for free  Spyware Computer virus Windows registry Uninstaller ITunes Windows 2000 MDAC Computer Gmail Mac OS X Windows XP Kazaa Microsoft Windows Mach kernel Anti-virus software Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Computer security Web crawler BitTorrent Blue screen of death Bluetooth Windows Installer Portable Document Format History of Microsoft Windows Steam (content delivery) Linked list C programming language Internet Explorer System 7 (Macintosh) Warez Barbara Boxer Mozilla Firefox RuneScape Computer chess Emacs Virtual memory Skype Patch (computing) Podcasting Linux Debugging Wget Malware Opera (web browser) Hash table MSN Messenger RISC Internet File system Stopping e-mail abuse Open access Proxy server Redundant array of independent disks Digital photography AmigaOS Macromedia Flash Common Unix Printing System Computed tomography British national identity card AOL Instant Messenger Computer science Copyright infringement of software IPod PNG Mac OS X v10.4 Trojan horse (computing) Starsiege: Tribes Library (computer science) CPAN Commodore 64 Computer and video games Apple II family Functional programming GameFAQs Atari 8-bit family MMORPG Ebook System/36 ZX Spectrum Thread (computer science) Year 2000 problem Advanced Packaging Tool Wine (software) MP3 Python programming language Unicode Software engineering OpenBSD TeX Digital circuit PlayStation Portable Quantum computer OpenOffice.org Berkeley Software Distribution

dual quadcore xeon system w o sli or single quadcore extreme w sli which would be better for gaming im going to buy a computer and im trying to decide which of these would be better since xeon server boards have the immense cpu support but lack sli support and the socket boards have sli but only one extreme processor i hope someone can help me with this the socket would be better since video cards have a far greater impact on performance than cpus so you would be much better off running in sli than having the cores now as the first person pointed out you are going overkill with either one of these setups cores is overkill at this point for gaming cores is just ridiculous the only time sli is really a good investment is if you are getting two top of the line cards which right now will run you in the area of which is not a great investment since in about months you could buy a single card that would outperform them but if you have money simply burning a whole in your pocket and you want to have both the cores and the dual video cards wait a few months and amd will have their new dual socket board out that will support two quad cores and multiple video cards  Pentium 4 3dfx GeForce 6 Series Xeon Opteron AMD ATI Technologies NForce4 PC motherboard RISC Dual-core NVIDIA Microprocessor Personal computer Pentium D PowerPC Athlon Athlon 64 CPU design Symmetric multiprocessing Pentium M Athlon 64 X2 Apple Computer CPU cache 64-bit IBM PC compatible GeForce 7 Series Computer workstation Front side bus TurboGrafx 16 NX bit History of Microsoft Windows IA-64 CDC 6600 Radeon Computer Pentium Pro PlayStation 2 X86 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Mac OS X Pentium III MIPS architecture IBM PC Windows XP Socket 939 Overclocking VIA C3 Poker jargon Nintendo Entertainment System Thread (computer science) Computer multitasking Nintendo Revolution VIA Technologies Celeron Mac OS X v10.4 Timeline of computing 1990-forward AMD 5x86 IA-32 Laptop Wintel Power Mac G5 INMOS Transputer Computer bus Embedded system PC Engine Console wars Sound Blaster PlayStation 3 History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Apple II family NeXT Amiga Apple Macintosh Original Amiga chipset BBC Micro IBM POWER Zilog Z80 UNIVAC Graphics processing unit Acorn Computers Microsoft Windows Pentium Sound card Apple IIGS Supercomputer Silicon Graphics

my computer restarts for no apparent reason my computer restarts for no apparent reason mostly when i try to run some software such as photoshop and other times randomly sometimes when it restarts it will keep going nonstop before windows even starts up it restarts in safe mode and once in a while when it's starting up it gives me a message saying i should insert a cd and press r to fix or something sorry i don't remember the message exactly i received a few errors here are some of them stop x e xc x bf xf d a x stop x e xc x aeb xaa b x x e x f x e f x e ef x stop x e x x x x yeah sounds like corrupted ram the easiest way to experiment with this is if you're using multiple sticks of ram to take out each stick and just try one by itself try different ram slots too as the slot itself can also become corrupted if that fails to work as well just run memtest see source for link it works rather like installing windows xp and can be booted off a floppy or i believe i'm not a blank cd r all in all it sounds like you're just going to have to invest in a new stick or two of ram  Blue screen of death Windows 2000 Booting Redundant array of independent disks Linux Commodore 64 Computer virus AmigaOS Atari 8-bit family Floppy disk Apple II family Windows XP Atari ST Software bug Acorn Electron USB flash drive Virtual memory Embedded system Backup Knoppix ZX Spectrum Amiga Nintendo Entertainment System Emacs Ethernet Apple Macintosh Apple IIGS Commodore 128 Debugging IBM PC compatible Microsoft Windows RISC Hard disk Windows Server 2003 Kernel (computer science) Opera (web browser) Slot machine Mach kernel Common Unix Printing System History of Microsoft Windows SAM Coup__ Personal computer MSX IA-32 Modem System 7 (Macintosh) Original Amiga chipset IBM PC DOS Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Freenet DR-DOS A600 System/34 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis BBC Master Architecture of Windows 2000 IPod NeXT Final Fantasy (video game) Library (computer science) Dance Dance Revolution TRS-80 Color Computer Laptop MDAC LiveCD Windows Mobile Federal Standard 1037C Bootable business card Motorola 68000 NX bit Windows 3.x Amstrad CPC Public-key cryptography Monkey Island Computer forensics Sega Dreamcast Blaster worm Apollo Guidance Computer Apple Computer Game programmer PlayStation 3 Btrieve DragonFly BSD Sound Blaster PaX Secure Digital card MS-DOS IMac Cheating in Counter-Strike TRS-80 One-time pad Palm OS Page table Pretty Good Privacy History of the graphical user interface CPU design

graphics memory problem with ati radeon xpress hi guys my pc has an ati radeon xpress chip built into the motherboard not seperate card and i recently went on to sandra lite and it stated that out of the mb of ram it has of it from the system memory and is from the module itself is their any way i can change this balance so that my computer has more ram for other tasks thanks thereds different types of intergrated graphics theres s m a shared memory architecture which is when the graphics permenently borrows a part of the system memory such as mb to add to its own mb onboard video memory which gives it mb video memory then theres turbocache memory built into stand alone graphic cards which the cards come with say mb and can borrow as much as it needs normally up to mb and will give the memory back as soon as its finished the application or game this is better as you dont actually lose the memory such as when you look in system propereties there will be gb there were as in s m a you would only see mb or round about as the onboard video has borrowed it onboard video can be altered in some bios settings however it depends on a the type of chipset b the type of bios c the amount of system ram go into set up press delete at start up and go to either advanced chipset features or pnp pci configurations and locate the settings which allow you to alter the amount of video memory note some bios set ups simply wont allow you to do this or it may not be there to do in the first place it all depends on the bios version in some bios you can lower your video to as low as mb however this is not recommended as it will affect your p c s performace the lowest i would ever set your p c s video memory is mb however at this you would struggle to play games but it would be fine for general internet and office tasks after any changes allways go back to the main set up screen and save and exit set up to save any changes to the cmos while it saves the changes to cmos do not turn off your p c i hope this helps good luck mate  Radeon 3dfx Apple Macintosh GeForce 4 Personal computer IBM PC compatible Windows 2000 Windows Vista Graphics card Radeon X Series Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Graphics processing unit The Sims 2 Commodore 64 Amiga Atari 8-bit family AmigaOS Nintendo GameCube PlayStation Portable Atari ST Blue screen of death Modchip Counter-Strike GeForce FX Redundant array of independent disks Commodore 128 Sound Blaster Power Macintosh G3 Dynamic random access memory PlayStation 3 Original Amiga chipset CMOS Computer bus PC Engine Apple II family History of Microsoft Windows Xbox 360 DDR2 SDRAM Front side bus Microprocessor Windows XP IBM PC Sega Dreamcast Apple IIGS Knoppix Computer VIA Technologies Northbridge (computing) Embedded system NForce4 Read-only memory Advanced Technology Attachment Emacs CPU design AMD History of operating systems MSX Far Cry Acorn Electron Slot machine Doom 3 Sinclair ZX81 Motherboard S3 Graphics Power-On Self Test Industry Standard Architecture Nintendo Entertainment System Microsoft Windows Neo-Geo X Window System Overclocking GeForce Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Mac OS X PlayStation 2 Nintendo 64 Amstrad CPC Texas Instruments TI-99/4A CPU cache ZX Spectrum Computer forensics Virtual memory Betting (poker) Sega Saturn Cisco PIX OpenGL Computer role-playing game Mouse (computing) NForce2 Creative Technology

reformatting hard disk on windows question i am reformatting my hard disk on my dell windows desktop computer it's a pretty old computer it's already formatting and i just realized that my files are getting erased and i would like to get those files back is there any way to backup those files now or is it too late i tried aborting it since i know all of the ms dos prompts is it possible to do it now it depends on how you're reformatting your hd if you're using format from the command prompt or the equivalent from the win ui then it's unlikely you'll be able to recover your files as i suspect the fats file allocation tables will have been trashed already that's why it gives you those warning messages along the lines of if you do this all data on the disk will be lost are you sure you want to continue if you're not just formatting but repartitioning fdisk the prospects are probably even worse if you're using something like partition magic you should be able to repartition your disk without losing files similarly if you're running the fat converter supplied with win you shouldn't lose any files i did this years ago after upgrading from win to win with no problems though aborting the process part way through would be a bad thing basically if the formatting process has already overwritten the fats then you're screwed because even the best disk recovery utilities won't know which sectors belong to which files if it hasn't you should still see some files on the disk and a good disk utility may be able to help you recover some of the deleted ones but i'd be quite surprised if that was the case it's much more likely gone forever  File Allocation Table Floppy disk Hard disk Disk formatting File system Computer virus NTFS Redundant array of independent disks Data remanence Windows 2000 Backup Disk cloning System 7 (Macintosh) Apple II family Windows XP Pretty Good Privacy WordStar DOS Fdisk Atari 8-bit family Linux AmigaOS CIH virus Virtual memory Enterprise content management IBM PC compatible Computer forensics Atari ST Macintosh Finder Windows Vista History of Microsoft Windows Object Desktop Dd (Unix) Plaintext File format Btrieve USB flash drive Library (computer science) Data recovery Windows 95 DragonFly BSD Windows 3.x Booting Apple Macintosh OS/2 Logo programming language Windows Me Personal computer System/34 Digital photography CP/M Embedded system Ghost (software) MDAC Malware Files-11 Filename extension HFS Plus FreeDOS Screenshot Laptop Norton Utilities Forth programming language Shred Blue screen of death Flash memory IPod Linked list Operating system SAM Coup__ Defragmentation Sound recording BASIC programming language Password Hierarchical File System Novell NetWare Gmail Cache Computer security Common Unix Printing System Master Control Program Knoppix C programming language CPU cache Page table Microsoft Jet Database Engine Compact disc ZIP (file format) RSTS/E

how to dismantle motherboard hi so i got to the point i need to exchange motherboard from my desktop i know good luck to me i had no idea where to start i saw it's attached to printer monitor usb ports and it seems i should remove it first any help thanks this process is very easy however certain cases have the motherboards that slide out the back and also pivot out on the side you'll need to study this to see if this is that type of case others require the power supply to be removed to get at the motherboard in any case you can remove the power supply to get to the screws that mount the board to the tower chassie first start with unplugging all items in the back of the tower and then remove all pci cards remove the power supply carefully unplug it from the motherboard next unplug the ide cables from the board and also the speaker on off ect wires if replacing with same board write down exactly where you unpluged them from this will make installing faster and easier now locate the screws that secure the board to the chassie usally of them once you have all the screws out the board will basically fall down be carefull the memory and processor is still on the board don't remove them until you are ready to put them in the new board they are very delicate study how they are held in so you don't pry them out and find that something is still holding them in the processor will come out with the fan as one piece don't take them apart there should be a small spring wire holding it in the memory removes by pushing the white tabs away from the memory with the memory poping out check to see where the slots on the memory go sdram has slots on it the second slot going in the down position ddr has one memory will only go in one way good luck and once you do this you'll be teaching yourself alot about how to build a computer  Universal Serial Bus Personal computer PC motherboard Power Macintosh G3 Computer hardware Computer case Computer bus IMac Atari 8-bit family Commodore 64 Dynamic random access memory Drill bit Motherboard AmigaOS Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis PowerPC Windows XP RS-232 Laptop Apple IIGS Atari ST Sound Blaster Desktop computer NVIDIA USB flash drive Overclocking Xbox Apple Macintosh Bluetooth IPod Oscilloscope Peripheral Component Interconnect GeForce 6 Series TRS-80 Color Computer Ethernet Radeon Northbridge (computing) MicroATX Graphics processing unit Apple II family Modchip ATX Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Cray-1 Hard disk Advanced Technology Attachment IBook Screw CPU design PlayStation 3 Amstrad CPC Random access memory Mach kernel Texas Instruments TI-99/4A 3dfx Glossary of climbing terms Floppy disk Accelerated Graphics Port System/36 EMac Embedded system Central processing unit Computer forensics ZX Spectrum Opteron SGI Indy PCI Express Digital photography Redundant array of independent disks Capacitor plague Sega Saturn Hash table Serial ATA Power Mac G4 64-bit Nintendo Revolution CPU cache CDC 6600 Sharp Zaurus D-subminiature Modem Reconfigurable computing Celeron Sinclair ZX81 Acorn Electron Arcade cabinet Cell (microprocessor) OpenBSD Windows 2000 Earring IBM PC compatible Front side bus

who invented the computer back in world war ii computer was a job title for people mostly women it turns out who were good with math their job was to do tons of arithmetic that was needed for calculating trajectories for cannons and bombs for coding and decoding secret messages and also for doing simulations of what became the atomic bomb the first mechanical computer might have been the z adder built from spare telephone circuits by a german engineer named conrad zuse it was used to guide glide bombs most early applications of technology not just computers seem to have involved warfare most folks though think the eniac is the real forerunner of what became the modern computer it was built in the s for the u s army and was used mainly to calculate ballistic trajectories the eniac was built by a team including engineer j presper eckert physicist john mauchly u s army captain herman h goldstine and mathematician john von neumann  Computer Von Neumann architecture Central processing unit Electrical engineering J.

need to upgrade my pc how do i and whats cheapest way i have pc with mb pentium processsor and gb hdd i need to increase to i g hdd and g mb i am not computer literate so someone else will need to fic it for me my mind is reeling with all the replies from u wonderful people off to pc world i go thanks all if you are in the uk take it to your local branch of pc world or maplin and ask for an upgrade what you want is unclear your terms are conflicting with what you want upgrading your ram memory from mb to gb may help and you could simply add a second hdd rather than los your gb drive depending on your bios it may need upgrading through a process called 'flashing' you may be able to fit a large capacity drive ie greater than gb but stick with a gb drive for now this should be able to be put in with your existing drive the techie people will know how to do this for you if there is only room for one hdd some pcs are crippled this way then the tech guys should be able to do a transfer from your gb hdd to the new larger hdd and it will run the same way you could also do some work yourself and buy a gb external drive from maplin for about pc world do it for about that drive just plugs into a usb socket in the back of your computer so no literacy needed there then you copy all of the files from the my documents folder to the new drive and then defragment your main hard drive as for the ram memory that's a five minute job at maplins or pc world and would be minimum cost although if you know what ram you need you can order it on line at www pcworld co uk under accessories and then go into the store and pick it up maplins tend to sell the memory for around twice the price of pc world at the moment and pc world have special discounts for web ordering you don't need to buy it just have it reserved at your local store i've never used the 'value' branded ram it's very cheap but i use the pny or component shop memory and mb is around to for the type i'd bluff the tech guys at pc world and ask them what sort of memory you need to upgrade your pc let them tell you and then make an excuse that you don't have enough money at the present time then go home with the info pre order the memory and go in the next day with your computer case and go to the info desk where you pick up and purchase the memory chips then ask if a tech guy can fit the memory it's only five minutes work then pay for the work done hope this helps i expect you would pay around or so for the ram upgrade labour and around for the actual ram chips so there's plus for the external hard drive so that if you buy a gb internal hard drive and have the tech guys fit it i hope they don't charge you any more otherwise it'll be an extra or so and that would be expensive for you you'd be spending to upgrade your memory and get a disk that's only rd the capacity of the external one sometimes you can save money by doing it yourself and it's not tricky to connect the external drive full instructions are supplied you could buy spares and upgrades from other suppliers and save some more money but the tech guys or maplins techie people may not want to handle items not bought in their store as they cannot guarantee them  Windows XP USB flash drive Personal computer Virtual memory Apple II family Laptop PlayStation Portable Atari ST IPod Commodore 64 Redundant array of independent disks Atari 8-bit family Apple Macintosh PlayStation 3 IMac Windows 2000 File Allocation Table Flash memory File system CPU design Computer RISC Digital photography Advanced Technology Attachment Modchip Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Xbox Universal Serial Bus Embedded system Nintendo 64 AMD Dynamic random access memory Commodore International Apple IIGS Mac OS X PlayStation 2 Read-only memory Acorn Electron Amstrad CPC Moore's law System 7 (Macintosh) Xbox 360 System/36 TiVo IBM PC Timeline of computing 1990-forward Secure Digital card PC Engine BIOS ZX Spectrum Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo GameCube PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Computer virus Microprocessor Betting (poker) Overclocking Atari 2600 Computer bus Commodore PET Final Fantasy XI Desktop computer Computer forensics History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Mach kernel Inflation History of Microsoft Windows MAME Wal-Mart 64-bit System/34 Digital circuit Linux Sound Blaster Acorn Computers NeXT Random access memory TRS-80 Bicycle lighting Bulk vending Poker jargon Mac OS Enterprise content management Texas Instruments TI-99/4A INMOS Transputer Apollo Guidance Computer Booting PowerBook CompactFlash Sharp Zaurus MSX

new imac vs old i mac which one is better the new imac with ghz processor is about faster than the old imac with ghz processor according to macworld http www macworld com firstlooks imacbenchmarks index php the key differences besides aesthetics that may have contributed to the performance boost new imacs have a mhz fsb instead of the old mhz the upgraded processor ghz instead of video card wise the old imac purportedly has a better one for games even though the new one has twice the memory finally the old imac ships with gb ram split into two mb sticks whereas the new one has one gb stick having it on one piece is better as you don' t have to toss out half a gig if you want to upgrade unless the old imac has more than two slots which i didn't look into now amazon has a rebate and reduced price on the old imac without tax after rebate the new ghz imac is http www amazon com gp product rebates b epney ref dp rebates ie utf m atvpdkikx der s pc so this changes the equation quite a bit if you like the aesthetics of the old machine this is your best deal you'll lose that of performance for in savings which you need to decide whether it's worth it to you although you could also argue that ilife ' will set you back at least about which puts the real savings at you could also go the education route if you are a qualifying student for the new imac and a free ipod nano or discount on an ipod but apple will charge tax depending where you live as an anecdote some people seem to like the old old imac round base with flatter screen and those have held their value despite slower performance so aesthetics do seem to matter to mac buyers and over time the verdict may be that the white imac was preferable to the new one  IBook IPod Apple Computer Pentium 4 PowerPC EMac PowerBook Power Macintosh G3 Commodore 64 Mac OS X Celeron Apple II family Power Mac G5 Mac mini Xeon Atari ST ITunes Music Store Power Mac G4 Cube Timeline of computing 1990-forward AMD Atari 8-bit family Radeon Overclocking PlayStation 3 PowerBook G4 CPU cache PlayStation 2 PowerPC G4 Laptop ILife Floppy disk Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Pentium III Cell (microprocessor) Wi-Fi Xserve TRS-80 Xbox 360 NeXT Apple Newton IBM PC compatible Front side bus RISC Timeline of computing IBM PC AirPort Apple IIGS Microeconomics MOS Technology 6502 64-bit Tax Data General Nova Mac OS Creative Zen PlayStation Portable Acorn Electron CPU design Mac OS X v10.4 FireWire Nintendo 64 IEEE 802.11 Commodore 128 Sega Saturn ITunes Mach kernel Power Macintosh Central processing unit NVIDIA Atari 2600 Game Boy Advance GeForce 6 Series Nintendo Revolution Acorn Computers Xbox Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Amstrad CPC TRS-80 Color Computer Sinclair ZX81 IPod shuffle Opteron System/36 CDC 6600 Inflation MSX ThinkPad Pentium M Acorn Archimedes Radeon X Series Apple Store MAME Tungsten Handheld Speed of light Nintendo GameCube

mac or pc i consider macs to be a higher end computer overall apple believes in quality rather than quantity therefore if you are willing to cough up the extra cash go for the mac you will probably have a better computing expirience than on a dell or an hp desktop but if you are a very basic user with a limited budget just get yourself a dell desktop p s if you are willing to wait a couple extra months the new version of the mac os x is coming out in october it will be much better than the current one  Apple Computer Apple Macintosh Mac OS X Mac OS Mac OS history X Window System System 7 (Macintosh) Laptop Apple II family NeXT Windows Vista PowerPC Konfabulator History of Microsoft Windows History of the graphical user interface Macintosh Finder Floppy disk Object Desktop MacWrite OpenOffice.org Online music store IBook Mac OS X v10.2 Mac OS X v10.0 Pretty Good Privacy Apple typography AmigaOS IMac Operating system PowerBook Radeon Mac mini WebObjects Computer Linux Opera (web browser) Mac OS X Server Atari ST TeX Apple Remote Desktop Computer wallpaper Microsoft Office Power Macintosh G3 Mac OS X v10.3 KDE AppleScript OpenGL Mac OS 9 Graphical Environment Manager Microsoft Power Macintosh Apple Intel transition Hard disk Mac OS X v10.1 ITunes Unicode Windows XP Athlon Computer virus Desktop publishing IPod MSN Messenger Apple Filing Protocol Apple IIGS Mac OS X v10.4 Skype Desktop environment Dot matrix printer Aqua (GUI) MacPaint Stardock Atari 8-bit family LaserWriter Microprocessor Remote Desktop Protocol CPU design Mouse (computing) Screenshot Portable Document Format Embedded system Copland Microsoft Word Vorbis Computer workstation Ethernet Supercomputer IBM PC compatible Common Unix Printing System Dashboard (software) Linux distribution Power Mac G5 Xcode FreeBSD 64-bit Wi-Fi Kazaa Icon (computing) Text editor HFS Plus

my pc system won't start at all after i changed my fsb speed from to i lowered my fsb speed because i was having trouble installing wow and i saw an answer from a support site that said if i lowered my fsb speed it would load it did load and everything looked fine and the game started but when i shut it off and turned it back on to change the settings back it never booted now what i can't get back in to change my bios back try clearing the cmos jumper on the motherboard there should be a pin header with a jumper on it labeled clear cmos or clear rtc move the jumper from pins to pins wait a few seconds and move it back then try it again either that or unplug the computer and remove the little coin battery from the motherboard either of these will load the bios defaults if it does not post after that then you might have fried something  Nonvolatile BIOS memory CMOS Universal Serial Bus Front side bus Modchip Booting BIOS Computer forensics Ethernet Hard disk Floppy disk Windows XP Advanced Technology Attachment Commodore 64 Athlon Pentium D Knoppix USB flash drive Digital photography Redundant array of independent disks Jumper (computing) Computer bus Windows 2000 RS-232 Nintendo Entertainment System AmigaOS Dog agility Personal computer Celeron Thermal power station MOS Technology 6502 Read-only memory Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Blue screen of death Atari 8-bit family ATI Technologies IPod Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis ATX Sega Saturn Pentium 4 Bluetooth MSX Motherboard X86 assembly language Integrated circuit Mouse (computing) Embedded system MOS Technology Southbridge (computing) PC motherboard NForce4 Cisco PIX AMD ZX Spectrum Domain Name System Fischer Random Chess High jump Duron Apple Desktop Bus Apple IIGS Parachuting Field-programmable gate array NX bit MIPS architecture Power-On Self Test Overclocking Pinball Data General Nova Kurt Angle KIM-1 Zilog Z80 Wire wrap BS 1363 Armored Core Apple Intel transition Protoss Modem Dynamic random access memory Pittsburgh Steelers Toyota Prius Amiga Apple Macintosh Partition (computing) TRS-80 Color Computer FreeDOS Nintendo GameCube Equine conformation Hybrid Synergy Drive GRand Unified Bootloader PlayStation Portable HyperText Transfer Protocol ABIT Fritz-chip Gordon Banks Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Commodore 128

need advise on p processor hi guys i need some advise i got asus p p x ghz gb geforce gt mb i realize after having gt i still got lag at times so im wondering if i buy a proccessor ghz will there be a difference which is increase in my fps fps wont go below and btw my fps isnt constant for example i play dawn of war dark crusade i got fps later dropped to when lots of enemies attacking and in vga chart it say gt can get fps if so can any recommend a good proccessor for me suit my asus p p x do i had to change psu if i change new chip mine is watt i think hope some expert can help in thks you forgot to tell us about your ram and if you are using the fsb you see if you have gb or more ram your computer would be speedy visit http www coastmemory com and get more they guarantee that it will work but this is not the fastest upgrade keep in mind that this motherboard takes a socket p northgate prescott cpu so if you picked a faster cpu chip that supported fsb then you would get the ram to match so pick the right processor and ram to match at the higher bus speed if you got that thing working with only watts great but you might consider a watt power supply your asus p p x is ok but if you are into spending any real money you might get an all new motherboard cpu and ram that is much faster if i was a gamer i would be looking at an amd chip and faster motherboard i'd build up with gb of ram so instead of buying all new ram and cpu get the motherboard too when you are playing be sure to use task manager to kill all unused applications get the screaming up by turning down the other demands on your system keep in mind that if you are playing on the internet that it can be slow too get to faster game servers and increase your internet connection good luck and happy computing  Opteron Overclocking Athlon RISC IBM PC compatible Pentium D PC motherboard 3dfx AMD VIA C3 PowerPC Central processing unit Personal computer Apple Macintosh PlayStation 3 TRS-80 Color Computer Xeon ATI Technologies Atari ST INMOS Transputer Power Mac G5 Pentium III Apple IIGS Commodore 64 Computer bus GeForce 6 Series Cyrix First-person shooter Doom 3 Xbox 360 MIPS architecture 64-bit CPU design Super Nintendo Entertainment System VIA Technologies Sound Blaster Nintendo Entertainment System Commodore 128 History of Microsoft Windows Timeline of computing 1990-forward NVIDIA X86 Microprocessor Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Dual-core Embedded system Duron IMac Distributed computing PR rating Athlon 64 ZX Spectrum NX bit Natural Selection (computer game) Redundant array of independent disks Counter-Strike IBM PC Mouse (computing) PlayStation 2 Supercomputer MOS Technology 6502 Computer and video games Cell (microprocessor) Radeon Sega Dreamcast Microprogram Transistor Vector processor AMD K6-2 IBM POWER BBC Micro Advanced Technology Attachment Cheating in Counter-Strike Acorn Electron Atari 8-bit family GeForce 4 Itanium 2 NForce4 IA-32 AMD 5x86 Apple Intel transition PlayStation Portable Xbox MMORPG DEC Alpha Amiga AMD K6-III History of computer and video games Montecito Acorn Computers

my desktop computer sounds like a rocket wanting to take off any clue what is going on i'll bet money that the inside of your computer is dirty no slam intended it's just that of people never clean their computer out the processor fan speeds up to cool the processor when heavy loads are being applied such as some extensive program or when the fan is choked with dust bunnies the sensor allows more electricity to spin the fan faster therefore the 'rocket sound' you hear my theory due to several house calls to fix such solution turn the computer off open up the side and use a can of air to clean out the processor fan power supply fan and inside the general case area if it's been too long it may take two cans cost about bucks have a computer dude do it you don't wanta' know  PowerPC Central processing unit Overclocking CPU design CPU cache RISC Personal computer Microprocessor Hard disk IBM PC compatible Apple Macintosh Spacecraft propulsion IA-32 Commodore 64 Armored Core Supercomputer AmigaOS General Dynamics F-111 MOS Technology 6502 Cray-1 Laptop Modem Atari 8-bit family 64-bit Musical Instrument Digital Interface Compiler optimization Cell (microprocessor) Turbocharger Carburetor Athlon Diesel engine IMac Transformer Professional wrestling throws Microprogram Thermal power station CPU cooling Computer Tank Computer chess Commodore 128 Mars Exploration Rover Internal ballistics Galileo spacecraft Mach kernel Solar power Jet engine Microsoft Windows Linux Betting (poker) Desktop computer Wind power Cray-2 VIA C3 Nintendo Entertainment System Windows 2000 MIPS architecture Floppy disk Mac OS X Computer case Windows 3.x Fixed-wing aircraft Model aircraft Movie projector Computing Stream processing PowerBook CDC 6600 Apple Intel transition Space Shuttle program PDP-11 Windows XP Genetic algorithm Poker jargon Atari ST Fuel injection Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Parallel computing Embedded system The Amazing Race NVIDIA Word processor Computer bus Universal Century Technology USB flash drive Hubble Space Telescope Sega Saturn Axial compressor Apple II family Digital circuit Sega Dreamcast Wind turbine Railgun Cyrix X86 System/36 Texas Instruments Dairy PowerPC G4

on the dell page it says xps desktop run watts but it offers gtx mb graphics card will it be able to run a gts card then yea i looked on some pages and it said the gts n gts minimum req was watts but dell offers the gtx while it reportedly runs w update i've linked to a discussion forum at tom's hardware about this very issue some people are insisting that dell is understating the capacity of their power supplies others say they've been able to run cards like the gts and radeon x on the stock w well i've heard rumors that dell power supplies perform a little better than their wattage rating so this might be such a case for video cards the v rail is what matters so maybe the w dell psu performs closer to a w standard one i wouldn't count on that though i had to to upgrade my w dell power supply to run a gt it's also possible that dell automatically upgrades the psu when someone orders the gtx build and that's just not reflected on the page i'd ask them whether this is true then you could order the standard build and upgrade on your own certainly any psu that can handle a gtx mb can handle the less demanding gts here's a site that sells dell psu upgrades silencer series  GeForce 2 Windows Vista NVIDIA Radeon ATI Technologies IBM PC compatible Windows XP GeForce 7 Series Floppy disk IMac Atari ST Mac OS X Windows 2000 GeForce 3dfx GeForce 4 Apple Macintosh PlayStation 3 Laptop Nissan Skyline Graphics card Chevrolet Corvette Holden Monaro Apple IIGS Porsche 928 PowerBook GeForce 6 Series Redundant array of independent disks Apple Computer Ford Mustang SGI Octane Screenshot TRS-80 Color Computer Atari 8-bit family Microsoft Knoppix GeForce FX Amiga Doom 3 Pocket PC Athlon Commodore 64 Mac mini Visual Basic IBM PC Plymouth Road Runner Muscle car Wi-Fi PowerPC AmigaOS PlayStation Portable CPU cache Power Macintosh G3 Linux Nintendo Revolution Universal Serial Bus TGV WebObjects Mazda 323 Call centre Sega Saturn IBook Bicycle lighting Desktop computer Object Desktop Mainframe computer INMOS Transputer Dodge Viper Universal Mobile Telecommunications System X86 OpenGL Spyware Google 24 Hours of Le Mans Acorn Electron Microsoft Windows Dodge Dart History of Microsoft Windows PC Engine SGI Indy Mach kernel Porsche 911 Mazda Miata Game Boy Silicon Graphics Indian Railways ATX PlayStation 2 TiVo Xbox Counter-Strike Radeon X Series Internet fraud Pentium 4 Overclocking Computer workstation

building a desktop computer is it easy as long as you study up before hand and take your time it's not too difficult even for a first time builder if something doesn't seem to be clicking into place or fitting right double or triple check if you're doing it correctly you don't want to snap a ram module or break the pcb on a graphics card the second time is usually a cake walk with plenty of instructional videos on youtube and other video sites it's much easier than when i started there is also more great help at the forums of tomshardware com and anandtech com  Knoppix PC Engine Windows XP IBM PC compatible Overclocking Screenshot Windows Vista Commodore 64 Mouse (computing) Opera (web browser) X Window System Universal Serial Bus Apple IIGS Ethernet Atari ST Floppy disk Calculator Apollo Guidance Computer Nintendo GameCube Mac OS X CPU design Atari 8-bit family Commodore 128 Linux Computer bus Apple II family Desktop computer Power Macintosh G3 Random access memory Front side bus Drill bit AmigaOS Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Personal computer Computer-aided design Printed circuit board Macromedia Flash 64-bit Redundant array of independent disks Computer virus Apple Macintosh Sinclair ZX81 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Minesweeper (computer game) Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Amstrad CPC Violin Debugging The Amazing Race BBC Micro Stereoscopy Original Amiga chipset Surveillance Computer hardware High-definition television BASIC programming language Video Graphics Array CPU cache Video poker Amiga AMD K6-2 The Sims 2: Nightlife History of the graphical user interface Computer and video game genres Collision detection Object Desktop Computer software RISC Kernel (computer science) Emulator Xerox Star Pretty Good Privacy Hello world program Bluetooth Graphics processing unit Little Britain Acorn Electron USB flash drive Homestar Runner Card game Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Max Payne Blackjack Commodore International Internet fraud Laptop DDR2 SDRAM RuneScape quests Computer Paragliding TRS-80 Windows 2000 Common Unix Printing System Google HyperCard Microprocessor DVD Contract bridge SIMD

does dell or alienware have crap software if there is other brand computers that aint got no crap software please list them thanksss alienware was bought by dell in so don't expect a whole lot of difference in the software provided by either one dell has said that it would be cutting back on the amount of crapware installed on some of their machine but most will still remain unless you purchase a computer with no pre installed software expect to get some crapware the best way to avoid it is to build your own computer and install what you want heck depending on ones definition windows could be considered to have crapware included drm for example or it is even considered to be totally crapware by some remember with only a very rare exceptions you don't really buy software you buy a license to use it as is and agree not to alter it  Spyware Windows XP Digital rights management Linux Mac OS X Commodore International Copyright infringement of software Alienware Dell, Inc.

what does it mean to overclock overclocking is essentially setting the speed of the cpu in your bios to run faster than it is supposed to it typically runs as a multiplier of the system bus speed ex x bus speed something like that and then causes the processor to run at the new multiplied speed internally this increases performance but can be risky if you dont know what you are doing you may also have to adjust voltage to make up for more power that will be needed  Front side bus Athlon Central processing unit Celeron Microprocessor CPU design RISC IBM PC compatible Pentium 4 MIPS architecture Computer bus Opteron CPU cache AMD 5x86 Data General Nova CDC 6600 Hard disk Northbridge (computing) PowerPC VIA C3 INMOS Transputer Apple Macintosh Emulator Vector processor Radeon Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Personal computer Commodore 128 Clock rate IBM PC Motorola 68000 Oscilloscope Operational amplifier Tandem Computers Cray-1 Microprogram Pentium M Athlon 64 64-bit Apollo Guidance Computer Computer architecture Redundant array of independent disks Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Field-programmable gate array Computer cooling Mach kernel HyperTransport Pentium Pro HP 9000 Hybrid vehicle Intel i860 Supercomputer Spacecraft propulsion Advanced Technology Attachment Digital circuit Assembly language PR rating PDP-8 PC motherboard Pentium D AMD K6-III CMOS ARM architecture Pentium Computer Universal Serial Bus Cyrix Super Nintendo Entertainment System Cray-2 CP/M SCSI Control Data Corporation SETI@home Embedded system Sega Saturn DDR SDRAM NeXT Superscalar ABIT Pentium III Micro Channel architecture Risc PC X86 Wintel Pentium II Zilog Z80 Dual-core AltiVec IA-64 Power Macintosh G3 3dfx TRS-80 Color Computer Low voltage differential signaling PDP-11 Computer workstation X86 assembly language MAME

is this okay for a gaming pc i'm planning to buy a desktop and it's for gaming purposes from what i've chosen these are the basic parts amd athlon x gigs of ddr ram geforce gt gigs of hard disk from the components i've picked is this okay because it's just nice for my budget as for other things such as power supplies and which motherboard is better can anyone tell me which should i choose for the sli and overclocking part i have totally no idea what they're talking can anyone please explain to me here finally is this pc able to go for the long run because i wouldn't want it to be outdated so soon for the gaming purposes do not get gb ram because your computer will only recognize gb ram if you run bit operating software you could run bit os but it is definitely not compatible with alot of games if you are on a tight budget amd products are a good thing to stick with but intel's core duo series are much much faster than equal amd x series so you may want to spend some extra bucks geforce gt is fine for a budget pc it won't run your newest games at high setting though and it sure wouldn't last more than year as well get if you are using windows xp or for windows vista is much cheaper though and is a power consuming hog you need w power supply for w for and w for hard disk drive is fine make sure it is brand manufacturer like samsung seagate or western digital i prefer samsung in my own opinion due to it being the quietest for motherboard go for either asus gigabyte or evga products make sure they are amd compatible if you are getting athlon getting these motherboards with nforce northbridge series is a plus if you are looking for a sli mode later on sli is basically putting two same sli compatible geforce graphic cards into sli compatible nforce northbridge motherboard double the power but double the power consumption and much hotter system you shouldn't try to sli it if your computer case do not have enough case fans overclocking means just making your components usually cpu graphic card or ram run faster than it is suppose to be running we call it stock speed overclocked components often perform better than stocked one but they get much hotter so you need a very decent cooling sytem to your components like better fans and heatsinks mind ya overclocking is for expert only it will kill your system very quickly if you don't know what you are doing your pc assuming you are using gb ram with bit os will last about years after years if you change your graphic card assuming you still went for gt and add one more gb ram it will probably last another years hope this helped good luck with your new system  Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis NForce4 64-bit PC motherboard Apple Macintosh CPU design Athlon 64 Opteron Windows XP Front side bus History of Microsoft Windows AMD64 Northbridge (computing) Redundant array of independent disks PlayStation 3 Commodore 64 Graphics processing unit Timeline of computing 1990-forward Laptop X86 CPU cache Dynamic random access memory IBM PC Microsoft Windows Wintel Amiga Computer workstation Computer GeForce 4 RISC VIA Technologies Central processing unit Commodore 128 Windows 2000 Linux Windows Vista AmigaOS Cyrix IMac Xbox PowerPC IA-32 Flash memory ZX Spectrum Desktop computer DDR2 SDRAM Apple IIGS PlayStation 2 NeXT Atari 8-bit family Pentium D Graphics card X86 assembly language Sound Blaster USB flash drive Computer cooling Amstrad CPC MSX Universal Serial Bus NForce2 GeForce 2 PlayStation Portable Apple II family Windows 3.x MS-DOS VIA C3 Xbox 360 AMD K6-III Doom 3 GeForce 7 Series Virtual memory Socket 939 INMOS Transputer BIOS History of computing hardware (1960s-present) GeForce FX GeForce Pentium M Commodore International File Allocation Table

is there a good way to ground yourself if you are going to be doing computer stuff w out buying equipment i would like to do some computer work but know that it's a good idea to ground yourself first to avoid messing up ram and that kinda thing but i don't want to have to buy a special wrist band or anything any suggestions if you don't want to use a wristband then keep one hand on a radiator which are usually grounded avoid carpet keep the pc touching the radiator as a further precaution also have the pc on a desk or flat surface best bet is buy the proper equipment though caution turn the radiator off i know someone who didn't caution this can still pose a threat to the pc and yourself  Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Surveillance Shit Snowboarding General relativity Shaggy dog story Poker jargon Rich Mullins Campfire Welding Wearable computer Carpal tunnel syndrome Best Buy Wrist Craps Euphemism Drill bit Bondage (BDSM) IBM PC compatible Betting (poker) Mouse (computing) Blood on the Tracks Aerial (dance move) Skateboarding trick Gas metal arc welding Fire fighting Space elevator Mixed martial arts Magical objects in Harry Potter Tag Hey Jude Social rule Overclocking Modern naval tactics Lighting Milton H.

gbs of rams and gaming bit issue i'm supposed to be getting either or gigs of ddr rams the point is when regarding the gb it doesn't read completely on bit xp and vista systems mosly reads i can get a hold of both bit oss but what's on my mind is that if they have to use the wow to emulate pretty much all the games available doesn't that mean bit rules are applied and not only will that make gigs of ram available but will confuse the daul channel of the second set of rams x and maybe messup the whole clock if there's anyway around it in either or bit thats great if my whole theory about games using bit os rules to emulate please tell me thanks yup wow sorry it's wow wow is for emulating bit applications in a bit operating environment to answer your question you can't in a windows environment in any meaningful way get around the limit on bit addressing spaces it's a limit that all bit operating systems have not just windows the linux world has the best workaround for that issue however there is really no substitute to a bit environment i get what you're asking though if you're running a bit application in a sixty four bit environment will it take advantage of the full amount of ram available when running plus gigs of ram in a bit environment the answer is no at least i'm pretty sure of it although i'm not a hundred percent positve great question though it's a good question not typical of the drivel you normally see on yanswers do some research on it  Windows 2000 Windows XP Virtual memory PaX 64-bit NX bit RISC Emulator IBM PC compatible Dynamic random access memory X Window System Kernel (computer science) Modem Xbox 360 History of Microsoft Windows Mouse (computing) Sinclair ZX81 Linux Domain Name System Central processing unit Spring operating system Acorn Electron Theory of conduct AMD64 Motorola 68000 MIPS architecture Apple Macintosh Original Amiga chipset History of operating systems Expert system Atari ST Operating system Microprocessor Computer virus Embedded system PowerPC Super Nintendo Entertainment System Plan 9 (operating system) NTFS X86 MAME Mac OS X Microprogram Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Commodore 128 Wine (software) Error correction and detection Library (computer science) Computer numbering formats System 7 (Macintosh) TRS-80 Redundant array of independent disks USB flash drive Upper Memory Area MMORPG Commodore 64 Atari 2600 MP3 Visual Basic Forth programming language X86 assembly language File Allocation Table Modal logic MSX Land use forecasting Virtual machine Hard disk DOS Fritz-chip Computer Nintendo GameCube Amiga Quizbowl Flash memory Thread (computer science) IPod Windows Server 2003 Windows Vista OpenOffice.org Hash table PlayStation 2 Sound Blaster Pocket PC H.264/MPEG-4 AVC RISC OS Timeline of computing 1990-forward Page table

i noticed my in my pc power settings that the time to standby is longer than the time to hard drive shut why i have wondered for some time why in the factory settings for power management of a pc the hard drive is always set to shut off after the system goes into standby mode please explain the logic here thanks it is probably because it is configured that way when the pc goes in standby the hard drive is still running in the beginning allowing you to quickly turn the pc on within seconds if the hard drive shuts down it takes a little bit longer for the pc to start up  Apollo Guidance Computer Hard disk Windows XP Uninterruptible power supply Token ring Embedded system Universal Serial Bus Toyota Prius Windows 2000 Redundant array of independent disks Booting Golden Sun Mouse (computing) IBM PC compatible Btrieve Traffic light Hybrid Synergy Drive Partition (computing) Dynamic random access memory Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis DOS Advance Wars: Dual Strike Ethernet Central processing unit AmigaOS System/34 Advanced Technology Attachment Motorcycle Atari 8-bit family Hybrid vehicle New York Giants Shadow the Hedgehog Control Data Corporation Computer forensics Digital circuit K' Dog agility Macintosh Finder Sinclair ZX81 Carburetor NeXT Diablo II RISC Reconfigurable computing CPU design Power Macintosh G3 Chernobyl accident Electrophysiology Xbox 360 Linux Natural Selection (computer game) Frank Whittle Spacecraft propulsion System/36 Floppy disk Escape from New York Volleyball Motorola 68000 Mazda RX-7 X86 assembly language Radiation hardening Expert system Diesel engine Saturn V NX bit Commodore 128 USB flash drive Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Cleveland Browns Beatmania IIDX Personal computer Canon T90 Modem MAME Mach kernel IPod Apple IIGS Transistor RAM disk Original Amiga chipset Atari ST Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Video game music Computer architecture Variable Frequency Drive Quantum computer Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Wicked (musical) Team time trial Windows Server 2003 Logic Electricity generation Flash memory SCART The Ark in Space Protoss Windows 3.x Complexity classes P and NP Team Fortress Classic Cray-1

whats the differance between the c d drive on computers i have an hp computer and i noticed i'm running out of room on my d drive my c drive is just fine space wise but i don't know what the differance is between these two or what they are called aside from c d drive is the d drive my hard drive c my memory please help so i know what i need to look for to upgrade my system when i take it in in order to improve the performance of the video editing software on the computer the hard disk drive on the computer has been formatted into two partitions c and d most video editing software saves files to the d partition this prevents large video captures from consuming the available space on the c partition and possibly affecting system performance digital video consumes gigabytes for every minutes of captured digital video and it is very possible that a you could fill the c partition to capacity very quickly due to the way the operating system dynamically manages and resizes virtual memory if the c partition was filled to capacity the operating system may lock up and not be able to restart to maintain optimum performance of video edition software the d partition should be defragmented or formatted regularly  Windows 2000 Hard disk File system File Allocation Table Windows XP Partition (computing) Redundant array of independent disks USB flash drive Knoppix Apple II family Embedded system AmigaOS Apple Macintosh Floppy disk System/36 Computer virus DVD History of Microsoft Windows Mach kernel DragonFly BSD Computer Booting DOS Xbox 360 Digital photography PlayStation 3 ZX Spectrum OpenVMS MiniDisc Windows Vista Linux IBM PC compatible System 7 (Macintosh) Flash memory TiVo NTFS Nintendo GameCube Computer storage IPod Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis 8 mm video format Mac OS X Blu-ray Disc Disk cloning Modchip 64-bit Enterprise content management Trusted computing Kernel (computer science) ITunes Atari 8-bit family Amstrad CPC Apple IIGS PlayStation 2 MP3 Microsoft Amiga Warez CPU design Object Desktop Multics Xbox System/34 Gigabyte Library (computer science) Digital Equipment Corporation Microsoft Windows PlayStation Portable Creative Zen Sound recording Disk formatting DV Original Amiga chipset Btrieve Windows Server 2003 Commodore International Operating system Digital rights management Central processing unit ReiserFS Musical Instrument Digital Interface Memory Stick Binary prefix Ghost (software) Movie projector NeXT CD-ROM Compact disc FreeDOS TRS-80 Digital video recorder IBM PC

if i reinstall windows xp home service pack will it delete my current files currently i am running an xp professional service pack but i was wondering about switching to home it depends on what you're doing if you have an xp service pack update cd go ahead and use it the sp update doesn't care whether you have the home or professional version of xp if you have the full blown installation cd of xp home sp i would recommend that you have the disk reformat your hard drive first instead of trying to install home on top of pro in that case yes it will delete your files so you'll need to back up your data first however there really isn't any benefit from switching from the professional version to the home version since you already have xp pro sp i recommend you just upgrade your existing installation to sp you can visit microsoft's website and download the upgrade or you can order the cd from microsoft link below if you know someone who already has an sp upgrade cd go ahead and burn a copy of theirs and then do your own upgrade microsoft actually encourages sharing of the sp upgrade so there's no licensing or copyright violation if all you're copying is the sp upgrade  Windows XP Windows 2000 Microsoft Windows Windows Vista Linux Spyware System 7 (Macintosh) IPod Xbox ITunes NTFS Mac OS X History of Microsoft Windows Apple Macintosh WordStar Microsoft MAME File system File Allocation Table Internet Explorer Macintosh Finder Modchip Apple Computer PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Btrieve Floppy disk Kazaa IBM PC compatible WordPerfect PlayStation Portable TiVo Mozilla Firefox MS-DOS Apple II family Novell NetWare Microsoft .NET Virtual memory Digital rights management Internet Relay Chat Blue screen of death BitTorrent Hard disk OpenDocument Trusted computing IA-32 Windows Me DOS Redundant array of independent disks Windows Update Common criticisms of Microsoft Windows 3.x Knoppix Steam (content delivery) Opera (web browser) QuickTime Emacs Copyright infringement of software Anti-virus software Macromedia Flash Library (computer science) Pretty Good Privacy Windows registry Palm OS ZX Spectrum Disk cloning The Sims 2 Sega Dreamcast OpenOffice.org MSN Messenger Laptop Wine (software) Online music store Patch (computing) Copyright Microsoft Jet Database Engine Enterprise content management Stardock Proxy server Rootkit Atari 8-bit family Gmail PlayStation 2 Backup Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis United States v.

when i defragged a client's desktop you could hear the rythmic rattle across the room the operation finished ok and the computer still works but i know the palpable vibration isn't good the computer has been in use for at least three years without trouble and i haven't worked on it before so i don't know if this is a new symptom judging from the user's non reaction i gather it is typical is there anything to do or try other than making sure we have full backup and restore capability before it finally crashes if you get a new hard drive now you can do a full disk copy instead of having to rebuild it and restore files if it's clicking whether the user ignores it or not you should probably get that thing replaced  Windows 2000 Windows XP Redundant array of independent disks Virtual memory Computer virus File system Floppy disk IBM PC compatible Backup Linux MiniDisc Macintosh Finder History of Microsoft Windows Hard disk Steam (content delivery) Disk image Computer Laptop Windows 3.x AmigaOS Object Desktop MS-DOS File Allocation Table Commodore 64 Malware Cache IPod Commodore 1541 Apple IIGS Knoppix Apple Macintosh Windows Me Password Windows Vista Personal computer Microsoft Windows Novell NetWare Apple II family Embedded system History of the graphical user interface Mouse (computing) Defragmentation Atari ST Mach kernel Disk cloning WordStar Mac OS USB flash drive Stardock Partition (computing) Mac OS X Amstrad CPC Spyware MAME NeXT Operating system Google Boot image control System 7 (Macintosh) Data recovery Sound recording Screenshot X Window System DragonFly BSD Copy protection Warez Computer hardware System/36 Defrag Computer file 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Computer forensics Apple Open Collaboration Environment BIOS Apple Computer Xerox Star Microsoft Office Requirements analysis Computer storage Amiga Virtual Network Computing Digital photography Xbox Musical Instrument Digital Interface OS/2 ITunes Video game music Emacs Thin client Forth programming language Trusted computing Library (computer science) Blue screen of death Anti-virus software File sharing Flash memory LiveCD

how do you actually erase your hard drive there's a million ways to delete anything even defragmentation yet it seem's they never tell you how to actually bring up your hard drive so you can actually read and decide for yourself what and what not to erase should you choose to do so kind of like renting you live in the apt but the landlord has the key and can come in anytime he want's to and snoop around my question is this how does one actually get into the hard drive to bring it up and actually read what's on it and be able to erase things from it once and for all like the techs do on tv when they comfiscate a computer anything short of blow the computer up or take it apart and or besides defragmentation lol thanks its so simple dont make it too complicated go into my computer choose any drive which u wnt to erase or format right click on that drive and choose the option format  Virtual memory File system Windows 2000 Mouse (computing) Floppy disk Password Defragmentation MiniDisc System/36 Windows XP Amstrad CPC Computer CPU cache Defrag IPod USB flash drive Atari 8-bit family File Allocation Table Digital photography Trusted computing The Sims 2: University USB mass storage device class Morse Code Hard disk C programming language Linux Theory of conduct B3ta Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Computer forensics AmigaOS The Emancipation of Mimi Software engineering System/34 2channel Atari ST Snoop Dogg Shred Xerox Star E-mail Enterprise content management Tic-Tac-Dough TRS-80 Flash memory Xbox 360 Knoppix Garbage collection (computer science) Kasparov versus The World PlayStation 2 Disk formatting History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Monopoly (game) DVD Expert system History of Microsoft Windows Gmail Fragmentation HTTP cookie Redundant array of independent disks Interactive fiction Booting Commodore International The Human Stain Natural deduction E-mail spam Stardock Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 OpenDocument Apple Macintosh IBM 1620 On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Dance Dance Revolution Technology ALGOL 68 QuickTime Unicode Personal computer Manual transmission Sega Memory (computers) ITunes Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Nintendo Mod (computer gaming) ZX Spectrum IBM 1401 Copy protection Early IBM disk storage Desk Apollo Guidance Computer Animal Farm IBM PC compatible Apple Computer MAME IBook Hip hop collaborations Unix time

how much ram for a desktop what is the average amount of ram for a normal operating desktop computer as with most computer resource questions it depends if you are going to run windows xp or vista then i strongly advised you to get at least gb of ram to avoid slow system response but gb will get you by if running under windows xp there are many excellent brands of memory but you need to ensure compatibility to your motherboard chiefly a voltage tolerance issue usually the motherboard manufacturer or memory manufacturer will provide this info on their website or via email communication memory is definitely one of the best items to invest in as regards computer hardware although i really don't do much gaming i choose the types of memory favoured by gamers because these offer great stability cooling and overhead in order to meet the extreme demands placed on them by gamers these qualities translate into excellent data integrity and processing performance some excellent performance brands are ocz corsair geil crucial kingston patriot one additional piece of advice if you are using a local vendor be aware that they tend to use generic memory modules so you have to specifically request a name brand like corsair kingston or crucial these memory manufacturers also have on line memory configuration utilities that can help you choose the correct memory type for your system or motherboard should you decide to purchase the modules yourself hope this helps  IBM PC compatible Windows 2000 Windows XP Windows Vista Personal computer Overclocking AmigaOS Commodore 64 X Window System Atari ST Nintendo Entertainment System Random access memory Kernel (computer science) Virtual memory CPU cache Redundant array of independent disks ATI Technologies Desktop computer History of Microsoft Windows Universal Serial Bus Hard disk Mac OS X RISC Embedded system CPU design Mach kernel Emulator Atari 8-bit family Intel iAPX 432 Computer Amiga Athlon Microsoft Windows Pretty Good Privacy IBM PC Linux Library (computer science) 3dfx USB flash drive Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Super Nintendo Entertainment System File Allocation Table PlayStation 3 MS-DOS 64-bit IMac Pocket PC Dynamic random access memory Computer forensics Capacitor plague AMD Apple Macintosh Amstrad CPC Computer workstation C programming language Mainframe computer Windows Server 2003 INMOS Transputer System 7 (Macintosh) Computer bus Novell NetWare X86 NVIDIA Wintel Reconfigurable computing Perl Radeon PowerPC Sun Microsystems Sound Blaster ZX Spectrum Graphics processing unit Next-Generation Secure Computing Base Pentium M Dual-core BIOS Management information system Floppy disk Expert system Architecture of Windows 2000 Apple Computer Spring operating system Apple IIGS OpenGL Laptop Cray-1 Supercomputer Blue screen of death Hubble Space Telescope Btrieve

what is causing my pc video to change from yellowish to normal i have a viewsonic monitor a nividea video card an upgrade and am running vista on a month old loaded hp media computer after months the computer stopped working and it was sent back to hp they reformatted it and replaced everything and put xp on it i upgraded using the vista upgrade disk anyway my video sometimes gets a strong yellow tint for a few seconds or minutes before returning to normal there doesn't seem to be any pattern to it and it happens whether i'm running a game explorer or another program could i have a loose connection on the video card or need other drivers help it's driving me crazy as i sit here typing on a yellow screen it is probably a loose pin in one of the connections between the motherboard and the monitor try giggling the cord at both monitor and computer connections to see if it affects the picture try a different montior cable may be the cheapest solution to try after that you may have to replace the graphics card or the monitor  Personal computer Apple IIGS IBM PC compatible ZX Spectrum Windows XP Commodore 64 Television IMac Windows Vista Atari ST Atari 8-bit family Floppy disk Nintendo GameCube Digital photography IBM PC PlayStation 2 IPod Computer hardware Apple II family TRS-80 Color Computer Power Macintosh G3 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis AmigaOS Windows 2000 Desktop computer Computer bus Graphics card Sinclair ZX81 Universal Serial Bus Amstrad CPC BIOS Nintendo Entertainment System History of Microsoft Windows ATI Technologies TRS-80 Computer and video games Video Graphics Array Ethernet Computer System/36 PlayStation 3 Knoppix USB flash drive Modchip Xbox Microsoft Windows Commodore 128 Apple Macintosh Embedded system PC Engine Mouse (computing) Power Mac G4 Cube Hard disk Acorn Electron Nintendo Redundant array of independent disks System/34 Computer display Screenshot Commodore International America Online PC motherboard Scalable Link Interface BBC Micro Laptop Advanced Technology Attachment NVIDIA D-subminiature Nintendo 64 Copy protection Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Disk cloning History of operating systems Sound Blaster PlayStation Portable Color Graphics Adapter Computer printer SAM Coup__ Sega Dreamcast Windows Me Fritz-chip SGI Indy OpenGL KIM-1 Sound card 3dfx Microsoft In The Groove (game) Nintendo Revolution Computer and video game genres Monkey Island Mars Exploration Rover A600 Xbox 360

how could i power my desk top pc for outside use i need to power my desk top pc for a market and do not have the money for a laptop so i know i could use a generator but was wondering weather there was anything else about like a battery that could be charged up to power the pc generators can be nosey and it would be good for me if i could have an alternative power supply if you have a car nearby i have a solution i'm a truck driver and i use one of these for power http www cetsolar com winverter htm you can find these for at any truck stop i've seen them at walmarts as well but they are usually cheaper at a truck stop if there is a pilot truck stop near your home they have them for it plugs into a car's cigarette lighter and it will power a desktop i've done it you probably will have to keep the car running though if you want a a real alternative power supply they sell these things all the way up to watts they mount permanently to your car and must be hooked up directly to your battery a watt version will pretty much power your entire house with volt power you can find them for less than they make them in watt and watt versions as well  Laptop IBM PC compatible Wi-Fi Battery electric vehicle Bicycle lighting Transformer Universal Serial Bus Ford Ranger EV Radio controlled car Battery (electricity) Manual transmission Toyota Prius Electrical generator Lighter Solar power Hydrogen economy Loudspeaker Light-emitting diode Atari ST IPod Volt Pentium M Windows XP Microeconomics Grandview, U.S.A.

is the checking and defragmenting of disks safe all answers on here say its safe it is within reason but defrag works by picking up bits of randomly spread data and placing it next to a relevant piece of data so that the computer is not searching all over the hard drive for information its all in one place making access times much shorter imagine defrag picks up a vital file for running windows pick up is cutting it from the hard drives non volatile memory and holds it in ram until it finds a suitable place on the hard drive to relocate it half a block down the road a construction company inadvertently hits a power line and knocks out the electricity to your neighborhood that vital file was held in ram without power bye bye data its a long shot i know but no its not safe unless you have a u p s  Virtual memory Windows 2000 Redundant array of independent disks Memory (computers) Flash memory Defragmentation File system Computer virus Computer storage Random access memory FreeDOS File Allocation Table Cache Fragmentation Defrag Computer RAM disk System/36 Atari 8-bit family Floppy disk Partition (computing) Binary prefix Backup Google Read-only memory Commodore 64 USB flash drive MiniDisc System/34 Windows 95 Copy protection Page table PaX Apple II family Apple Macintosh Forth programming language Data remanence System 7 (Macintosh) Original Amiga chipset AmigaOS Enterprise content management Atari 2600 Password cracking TRS-80 IBM PC compatible Embedded system Commodore 128 Non-volatile memory Freenet Apollo Guidance Computer IA-32 Password 64-bit Novell NetWare Datatype Dynamic random access memory Early IBM disk storage Windows Vista PlayStation 3 Skype Macintosh Finder DOS RISC Norton Utilities File format Computer file Computer multitasking Solid state disk C programming language Amstrad CPC Digital circuit ZX Spectrum Universal Serial Bus Quantum computer Baroque chess DVD Spring operating system Error correction and detection GunZ The Duel Sinclair ZX81 MS-DOS MRAM IBM PC Acorn Electron Cryptographic hash function Master Control Program Windows 3.x NeXT Domain Name System Buffer overflow Randomness Quicksort Federal Standard 1037C

whta is the diffrence between windows vista bit and windows vista bit what is the diff and how can i get the bit one and is thier even mor power full ones beat me if you're always using professional type programs that can take advantage of a bit operating system then that's what you would choose the main thing with bit windows is that it can utilize gb of memory ram while bit can only use gb gb can create bottlenecks and slow a system down when using high end apps programs  Microsoft Windows IBM PC compatible Windows Vista CPU cache Windows 2000 History of Microsoft Windows Windows XP NX bit Windows 3.x Computer virus Virtual memory Windows Server 2003 Personal computer Central processing unit 64-bit Apple Macintosh PaX Microprocessor Windows API AMD64 Mac OS X Microsoft Office AmigaOS Random access memory Library (computer science) Timeline of computing 1990-forward JADE programming language Magnetic core memory Dynamic random access memory RISC Blue screen of death Read-only memory Buffer overflow BASIC programming language Computer numbering formats TRS-80 History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Portable Document Format Kernel (computer science) OpenGL MS-DOS History of operating systems Overclocking Telegraphy Flash memory MRAM Page table Sinclair ZX81 Windows 95 CPU design Atari ST Timeline of computing MIPS architecture Apple II family Thread (computer science) Terminate and Stay Resident Metadata WindowBlinds Sprite (computer graphics) Microcontroller DirectX Upper Memory Area Intel iAPX 432 Linked list NeXT BitTorrent System/34 Emacs Static Random Access Memory Architecture of Windows 2000 System 7 (Macintosh) Emulator File system permissions Operating system Drill bit Motorola 68000 Apple IIGS Teletext GNOME Macintosh Finder Windows XP Professional x64 Edition Commodore 128 Spring operating system Memory (computers) X86 assembly language Linux Windows 2.0 X86 Modem Diff Forth programming language Datatype Load (computing) File system System 6 Plan 9 (operating system) Carbon (API) Symbian OS

my dell computer is almost impossible to turn on once it is turned off i have to hold down the on button until the dell sign comes on and then the screen goes blank sometimes it does come on or minutes later could this be the motherboard gone bad i suggest this using dell pc restore by symantec notice using dell pc restore permanently deletes all data on the hard drive and removes any applications or drivers installed after you received your computer if possible back up the data before using pc restore use pc restore only if system restore did not resolve your operating system problem note dell pc restore by symantec is not available in all countries or on all computers use dell pc restore by symantec only as the last method to restore your operating system pc restore restores your hard drive to the operating state it was in when you purchased the computer any programs or files added since you received your computer including data files are permanently deleted from the hard drive data files include documents spreadsheets e mail messages digital photos music files and so on if possible back up all data before using pc restore to use pc restore turn on the computer during the boot process a blue bar with www dell com appears at the top of the screen immediately upon seeing the blue bar press ctrl f if you do not press ctrl f in time let the computer finish starting and then restart the computer again notice if you do not want to proceed with pc restore click reboot in the following step on the next screen that appears click restore on the next screen click confirm the restore process takes approximately minutes to complete when prompted click finish to reboot the computer note do not manually shut down the computer click finish and let the computer completely reboot when prompted click yes the computer restarts because the computer is restored to its original operating state the screens that appear such as the end user license agreement are the same ones that appeared the first time the computer was turned on click next the system restore screen appears and the computer restarts after the computer restarts click ok go to microsoft updates as you now will be way out of date  Computer virus Blue screen of death AmigaOS Windows 2000 Spyware Mouse (computing) Microsoft Windows IPod Gmail Booting File system IBM PC compatible Disk cloning Macintosh Finder Computer forensics Virtual memory Apple Macintosh Embedded system Amiga Redundant array of independent disks Domain Name System Common Unix Printing System Floppy disk Emacs File Allocation Table System/34 Universal Serial Bus Hard disk Digital photography System 7 (Macintosh) Macromedia Flash ITunes Mach kernel Unicode NTFS Control-Alt-Delete MDAC Computer WordStar Windows Server 2003 Hello world program Personal computer NX bit Apple Computer Patch (computing) E-mail ZX Spectrum Btrieve Atari 8-bit family Screenshot Pretty Good Privacy Anti-virus software System/36 Copy protection Steam (content delivery) History of Microsoft Windows Atari ST Backup Windows Me FreeDOS Commodore 64 Microsoft OpenDocument Partition (computing) Linked list MS-DOS Musical Instrument Digital Interface Windows Vista OpenOffice.org Web crawler Internet Relay Chat HyperCard CPU cache DragonFly BSD Mozilla Firefox QuickTime Computer insecurity Mac OS X v10.4 USB flash drive Windows 3.x PlayStation Portable Commodore International File format GameFAQs Mydoom Library (computer science)

how can i fix my parents' pc it's constantly doing cleanup work for hours mostly its in the evening but sometimes afternoon when it's doing it you can hear the hard drive ticking away in what i presume is it's cleanup reorganising proceedure and the system feels slower and it takes a long long time to complete whatever it's doing yet it does it so regularly my pc doesn't do it that frequently during it the task bar doesn't show any unusual processor resources activity cpu usuage can it be altered to do it's reorganising work less often and if so how please although a noisy hdd is sometimes a sign that it is one its way out and its time to back up the symptoms you describe sound more like a program or routine running in the background do you have anti virus and spyware software installed if so see if they are scheduled to run at this time might be doing a low level scan which would not necessarily show as high cpu activity also have a look to see what is running in the start up routine just in case you have something running in background go to start click on run type in msconfig click on the start up tab and have a look at the programs which are ticked if there are any that you do not need to have running all the time quicktime for instance untick them and ok it you will have to re boot to accept the changes when it re boots you will get a warning screen make sure you put a tick in the relevant box to indicate you don't want to see this warning in the future also once you have backed it up try defragging it and finally run error checker on it do this by going to my computer right clicking on the hard drive icon select properties choose the tools tab click check now on error checking i only suggest these two options last as i don't want you to mess with the drive too much until it is backed up if it is already backed up and safe try the last options first  Windows XP Computer virus Virtual memory Spyware AmigaOS CPU cache Embedded system Extreme Programming Malware Mach kernel ZX Spectrum Linux Central processing unit Apple Macintosh Computer multitasking Amstrad CPC Apple IIGS Rootkit Computer Gmail Microprogram System/34 Commodore 128 Macromedia Flash Screenshot Software testing DragonFly BSD Atari 8-bit family Redundant array of independent disks NX bit Game programming MIPS architecture Hard disk Mouse (computing) Compiler optimization RISC Microsoft Windows Object Desktop System 7 (Macintosh) Mozilla Firefox Xerox Star Mac OS X IPod Anti-virus software PlayStation Portable PaX MAME Spell checker PDP-11 Data General Nova Digital circuit Knoppix Overclocking Laptop Personal computer PlayStation 3 Objective-C Jumpstart 3rd Grade IA-64 Vector processor Buffer overflow Java programming language Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis International Phonetic Alphabet CDC 6600 Commodore 64 Halting problem Antiretroviral drug Blue screen of death Sinclair ZX81 Master Control Program Kazaa NeXT Compiler The Amazing Race Stopping e-mail abuse Common Unix Printing System Diablo II: Lord of Destruction 64-bit Windows 3.x Garbage collection (computer science) Trusted computing Internet fraud USB flash drive Cache Python programming language Apollo Guidance Computer

should i get a mac or pc for highschool college i'm looking to buy a new computer for my highschool senior year and to use throughout college i haven't used a mac in years or so which is why i'm asking i've heard that macs are usually more user friendly towards students and don't really know too awful much about the new vista feel free to offer me the pros and cons of both operating systems i only want real answers not losers giving answers like mac sucks get a pc or the like thanks in advance it used to depend on what field you were going into when my friend was getting her phd in chemistry all the software she needed was only mac compatible so she had to get a mac i am a mac user but as a graphic designer who has worked on both platforms i find the mac offers a more stable environment but i digress i would suggest a mac is the best bet since you can use boot camp to install both mac and windows operating systems on it if you find the need to have windows only software with the usability of a mac you'll have an easier time accessing wireless networks at whatever your choice of colleges turns out to be as well as having a great suite of built in software in the ilife bundle to maintain photos videos music and even a personal web site if you choose bonus if you play music or want to mix music the garageband program is a great way to start hope this helps make the decision easier  Apple Macintosh Mac OS X Apple Computer Linux IBM PC compatible ITunes Microsoft Windows Microsoft Office Windows Vista ILife Windows 2000 X Window System Computer virus History of the graphical user interface History of Microsoft Windows OpenOffice.org Operating system Java programming language Mac OS X v10.4 Amiga AmigaOS QuickTime HyperCard Timeline of computing 1990-forward Mouse (computing) Portable Document Format Mac OS Microsoft Windows 3.x Perl Windows Server 2003 Wi-Fi OpenBSD Commodore 64 Pretty Good Privacy File system IPod Opera (web browser) Visual Basic Common Unix Printing System System 7 (Macintosh) MSN Messenger Mac OS history Berkeley Software Distribution PlayStation Portable Mac mini IMac NeXT Floppy disk Unicode Education in Romania Atari ST Mach kernel Computer Windows API Computer and video games KDE Mozilla Firefox Web browser DOS Kernel (computer science) WordPerfect FreeBSD FileMaker Unix Booting Library (computer science) Software testing Xbox 360 Wintel AOL Instant Messenger TeX Spyware MS-DOS Ashton-Tate WebObjects Emacs Personal computer GNU General Public License OS/2 Internet Explorer GNU Computer software MAME Sun Microsystems Blue screen of death Atari 8-bit family DR-DOS GNOME Objective-C Bluetooth

the volume button is disappeared on my computer and when i went to sound and audio it said i had no audio please help if you understand what im trying to say here i am assuming you checked by going into start control panel sound and audio devices icon when you open this icon there should be pages one for volume sounds audio voice hardware look at the st page volume there should be a section called device volume check off place volume icon on the taskbar hit apply and say okay this will place the volume icon back on the taskbar for you if you are still having problems i recommend you try re installing your audio drivers go to your computer's manufacturer's website and utilizing your model number find the drivers and install them again try the initial step again if this still does not work your sound board might have gone bad or a wire might be loose this however rarely happens if it does though you will need to take it to a professional try pricing sound boards prior to taking it to someone to avoid getting ripped off best of luck  Windows XP Object Desktop Windows 2000 Atari 8-bit family Synthesizer Modem Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis AmigaOS Taskbar Musical Instrument Digital Interface Windows Vista Universal Serial Bus Bluetooth IPod Loudspeaker Screenshot X Window System Control Panel (Windows) Apple Computer Central processing unit Windows Mobile Laserdisc ZX Spectrum Embedded system Redundant array of independent disks Floppy disk Apple IIGS Vacuum tube CPU cache Hearing aid Sound recording Device driver OpenGL Linux Mach kernel Nintendo Entertainment System Audio level compression DVD Multitrack recording Windows 95 Blue screen of death Disc jockey Debugging Computer Video game music Audiophile Internet protocol suite Fischer Random Chess Hardware random number generator Copy protection Digital audio workstation Booting GSM services Cheating in Counter-Strike PlayStation 2 System 7 (Macintosh) Windows 3.x Sound Blaster Mouse (computing) IBM PC compatible Microsoft Windows Mozilla Firefox History of the graphical user interface Nintendo GameCube Voice over IP Computer and video games Prank flash Sound card Dance Dance Revolution Effects unit Sound effect USB flash drive Toyota Prius Xbox 360 Digital photography Xbox Podcasting IMac Mixing console Medical prescription Information Technology Infrastructure Library Karaoke MP3 Apple Macintosh Computer virus Digital circuit CPU design Collision detection Stardock Atari ST NX bit PlayStation Portable Best Buy Super Nintendo Entertainment System Apple II family Impedance matching SCART

processer help i have a socket lga the processor that came with my computer is a p extreme i just found a good deal for a intel core quad q ghz for do these even come close to the core extreme i also dont want to spend anymore money on cooling products i already have mm fans intake on side panal top exhaust and back exhaust i want to know if thats enough for a hog quad core yes it does have cores woo hoo but not everything can use two cores let alone so in a great many cases the core extreme will outperform the q and if you are talking about the quad core core extreme of course it will be better since it is faster that said don't pay for a core extreme just too much money the slight performance gain is not worth an extra no way as for cooling as long as you don't overclock you should be fine lastly make sure your motherboard will support the core s just because it is socket does not mean it will support them  Athlon Pentium 4 Overclocking Celeron AMD PC motherboard Xeon Pentium M VIA C3 Opteron NVIDIA AMD K6-III Pentium III RISC GeForce 6 Series PowerPC Pentium D Central processing unit Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis 3dfx Microprocessor Cyrix ATI Technologies Northbridge (computing) Athlon 64 Radeon Dual-core PR rating CPU cache Pentium Pro Front side bus IA-64 VIA Technologies Duron Intel iAPX 432 Athlon 64 X2 Jet engine Power Mac G5 IMac AMD K6-2 NForce4 Mac OS X v10.4 Socket 939 AMD 5x86 Itanium 2 Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Personal computer DEC Alpha Commodore 128 Casting CPU design ABIT Coprocessor Turbofan PowerPC G4 Apple Intel transition GeForce 4 64-bit Cray-1 Motherboard Two-stroke cycle Timeline of computing 1990-forward Sempron Mac mini Hyper-threading Computer workstation Carburetor Novell NetWare Outsourcing Capacitor plague IBM POWER Mac OS X Quake III Arena Supercomputer Pentium II Apple Computer Sand casting Intel 80386 PowerBook Wintel Armored Core Clock rate CDC 6600 Atari ST Intel i860 Cell (microprocessor) Turbocharger Burroughs B5000 Radeon X Series INMOS Transputer NX bit Graphics processing unit Computer Sound Blaster Computer case Benchmark (computing) Windows XP Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Drill bit History of Microsoft Windows

how do you reset the entire memory on a computer cuz my sisters completely messed up my computer and screwed around with the passwords and everything so i was wondering if there was a way to reset everything back to the way it was when i first got it and also can you fix a broken disk drive by yourself or is this something you would have to bring in or call someone for like if it doesnt open i assume by disc drive you mean cd dvd drive they are cheap to replace like at a computer store or newegg com if it's a brand name pc under warranty they're free just call the support center they're easy to install too the only precaution is put it in how you replaced the other one ie power cable ribbon cable and then if there are jumpers check the diagram on the top of the disk drive before you put it in to make sure that it's primary secondary or cable select like the one you replaced with that done you are able to reinstall the operating system you'll need the recovery discs it came with backup partion of the hard drive or ordering buying a new copy of the os if it's a brand name even out of warranty the original software should be inexpensive to order like the process has you put the discs in one at a time from when the computer first boots on you press any key to load from the disc and then it should guide you very easily from their if you want the original settings and have your data backed up if you wanted choose destructive recovery advanced recovery or restore to out of the box state  Redundant array of independent disks Windows 2000 USB flash drive PlayStation 2 System/36 Booting Computer virus Hard disk Floppy disk Backup Atari 8-bit family Partition (computing) AmigaOS Xbox IBM PC compatible Virtual memory Oscilloscope Modchip Computer forensics DVD Copy protection Linux Cache Advanced Technology Attachment Password Nintendo GameCube Embedded system CPU cache File system Data remanence System/34 BIOS PlayStation Portable Personal computer Apple Macintosh Computer Sega Dreamcast Digital rights management Digital photography Disk cloning Computer storage Disk image Computer hardware Password cracking IBook Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis ZX Spectrum Nintendo 64 MAME PDP-11 PlayStation 3 Sega Saturn Apollo Guidance Computer Digital video recorder Malware Xbox 360 Amstrad CPC Btrieve DOS System 7 (Macintosh) Novell NetWare IBM PC NTFS Gramophone record Universal Serial Bus Cable television Database NeXT DragonFly BSD Animal Crossing High-definition television Anchor Federal Standard 1037C Compact disc Mouse (computing) Windows Vista PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Apple Computer Blue screen of death Elevator Drill bit Commodore International Mach kernel Acorn Computers Disk storage Library (computer science) Data recovery Nintendo Revolution Blu-ray Disc Multitrack recording

if i want to add more ram to my computer what do i have to do i have an asrock p vm mother board and ghz adding memory to your p c is probally the easiest and at the moment the cheapest upgrade you can do on your p c first you need to asertain your type of memory that your motherboard uses to do this go to http www crucial com and run the online memory tool this will report to you the correct memory to use and also which type ddr ddr note down any relevant info for when you need to search online for the memory to install the memory first you should turn off your p c then earth yourself to a radiator to flush any static from your body or use a anti static band instead then open your case and locate the memory banks which are next to your pci express agp slot and choose a empty slot and open the clips at either end then holding your new memory module at either end do not touch the actual memory chips on the module and making sure the module is the correct way it will only go in one way and gently insert the module into the memory bank making sure the clips at either end both clip into place if they do this is a sign you have correctly inserted your memory double check the module has been correctly inserted and then close the case after which you should boot up and if the memory is fine it will boot up no problems if there is any post beeps this means a problem open the p c up and check the modues have been fitted properly and that the module isnt damaged finally when buying memory go for either kingston value or corsair value its cheap lifetime garuentee and i have never had any problems with that brand any problems let me know good luck mate  Random access memory Personal computer PC motherboard Computer virus Commodore 64 Dynamic random access memory Debugging Redundant array of independent disks Nintendo Entertainment System Domestic AC power plugs and sockets AmigaOS Floppy disk Peripheral Component Interconnect Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Datatype PowerPC 3dfx ALGOL 68 Northbridge (computing) CPU cache PlayStation 2 Power Mac G4 Federal Standard 1037C Overclocking Sound Blaster Atari ST DDR SDRAM IMac AMD Amiga Atari 8-bit family Apollo Guidance Computer IBM PC Modchip Hash table Computer bus Compiler optimization USB flash drive PCI Express 64-bit ZX Spectrum Screw Pentium 4 C programming language Menstrual cup Hello world program Drill bit Hard disk Windows Vista Accelerated Graphics Port World Wide Web Windows 2000 Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Sinclair ZX81 MSX Computer hardware Read-only memory NVIDIA Computer forensics Apple Macintosh Windows XP PlayStation 3 Perl GeForce 4 RISC Hubble Space Telescope Super Nintendo Entertainment System Blue screen of death Front side bus OpenBSD Graphics processing unit DDR2 SDRAM BIOS DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX CDC 6600 PC Engine EMac Library (computer science) Power-On Self Test Radiation hardening GeForce FX System/36 Radeon Wheel of Fortune Python programming language IPod Commodore 128 Linked list Quicksort Collision detection Oscilloscope Virtual memory

my computer makes this strange whoosing noise please help yesterday evening while i was at my computer i suddenly heard kind of a click and then my computer started making this bizarre whooshing noise it keeps doing that for a few minutes at a time and then stops for a while and then it starts with the whooshing noise again i have an hp pavilion that's about years old it still works though but i'm scared because i have no idea why it's doing that if you could help me find out what's wrong and how to possibly fix this i would so much appreciate it thanks so much in advance edit it only made that clicking noise once last night and then it started making the whooshing noise the clicking noise hasn't happened again but the whooshing noise starts up every few minutes stops and then starts all over again edit the whooshing noise sounds like the noise a vacuum cleaner would make but not quite as loud if you have an air duster try dusting the fan area if it's dirty that maybe the cause you don't have to open the cpu a little cleaning is a lot of help  Douglas Adams Sound effect Prank flash Gramophone record Sound Vacuum cleaner Whale song Initiation (phonetics) Time Out of Mind Mouse (computing) Axial compressor Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story CPU design Social rule Cyberspace CPU cooling Morse Code Little Britain The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe It's All Gone Pete Tong John Cage The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases 8 mm video format USS Tunny (SS-282) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Computer Milton H.

shutting my computer down how often people have told me never to shut down my computer but i think thats a bunch of bs i left my old computer on all the time and it burned out i just want to know officially how much you should shut it down i always get different opinions also i keep it in the attic and during the day it gets to be like degrees up there is that bad for it too i'm assuming yes also in the winter it gets to be around degrees up there is that bad too that heat will kill your computer you must find some place cooler or get a cooling system up there a computer should never operate at more than about degrees f unless it was specifically designed to do so even storing your pc at that temperature with it powered down will destroy some of its parts the shutdown question is like the old chicken egg debate my pc hosts several web sites so i need for it to be on all just about all of the time but personally i do shut it at least once a day then turn it back on after a minute not the re start but shutdown power down for about one minute and then turn it back on one thing this does is clean out the page file or the windows cache file you have to set this to happen this is not the default setting for windows i will admit though that this is probably a little harder on the power supply than leaving it on but power supplies are pretty cheap good luck and happy surfing troy as far as you computer burning out because of leaving it on i would say that the pc more likely burned out from being constantly over heated not from being left on you really do need to move it to a much cooler place  Windows 2000 Domain Name System Windows XP Turbocharger Cache Solar power Hard disk Virtual memory Motor oil ITunes Spacecraft propulsion Mouse (computing) Universal Serial Bus Personal computer Embedded system Pretty Good Privacy Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Theory of conduct Thermostat Computer CPU cooling Library (computer science) Computer forensics Password Air conditioning The Inside Fire fighting Windows Server 2003 The End of the World (Doctor Who) Blue screen of death Shutdown CANDU reactor Toyota Prius Opera (web browser) Nuclear reactor National Weather Service 64-bit Apple Computer SL-1 File Allocation Table Diesel engine Heinkel He 100 Overclocking Emacs Redundant array of independent disks HTTP cookie Architecture of Windows 2000 Pressurized water reactor Gnutella Screenshot CPU design Thread (computer science) RISC NX bit Web browser Furnace Microsoft Windows Server MP3 Fossil fuel power plant Booting Windows 3.x Web hosting Gas compressor USB flash drive Space Shuttle program Armored Core File system Three Mile Island System/34 Climate of the United Kingdom Classified information Charles Goodyear Mercury Atlas 6 Carburetor Hydrogen economy Pebble bed reactor History of Microsoft Windows Autonomous building Malware E-mail spam Linux Kazaa Glossary of firefighting equipment Thermal power station BitTorrent Luck MIPS architecture Social rule Central processing unit Debugging The Star Wars Holiday Special Gmail JADE programming language

how many mb's is kb's im downloading from the internet archive and it says source sdb webcast kb s delta cooledit lineage delta cooledit cdwav shn taped by loadstone transferred by loadstone keywords live concert my download box says im am at mb so far how much longer whats the ratio transfer rate is kb's a second is that good points to first quality answer i am e stupid i tjhe info i gave is all i know i just copied what it said and asked you its been going for minutes now im up to mb i hope this is the whole file its a live hank show at cbgb's thank you all hank dot com hank williams the rd http www archive org details hw shnf first you can't just move the decimal because mb kb kb bytes gb mb get the idea but kb isn't the file size it's the recording size the source is a webcast which was recorded and or streamed for a transfer rate of kb s t line levels now the answer to your question notwithstanding the information is k k per megabyte mb so k of a megabyte it should download in seconds on your transfer rate but the think you're downloading is obviously bigger than that due to the very high encoding recording size that's listed you don't have the total file size information listed above so it's anybody's guess edit remember that a cd holds about minutes worth of music but if you were to take all of that data and just copy it to your hard drive it woudl take up about megabytes of space cd quality i believe is about kb second so if this is kb s and the concert is hours long you can expect about a mb file does that make sense  MP3 Floppy disk Compact disc Domain Name System CPU cache Streaming media BitTorrent ITunes Gmail Megabyte Warez DV CD-ROM Early IBM disk storage File sharing Digital photography NTFS Computer file Tar (file format) PNG Web crawler ZX Spectrum Video game music Redundant array of independent disks Internet High-definition television Family Feud Password Digital rights management Audio data compression Quantum computer Skype Orders of magnitude (data) HyperText Transfer Protocol Speed of light Unicode DVD MiniDisc PlayStation Portable TiVo XML File system Uploading and downloading Computer virus File Transfer Protocol Dd (Unix) Modem Logo programming language Java programming language ID3 Pretty Good Privacy OpenDocument Vorbis Filename extension Disk image World Wide Web Backup Computer numbering formats Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Advanced Technology Attachment Windows XP Open access Mozilla Firefox Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

is it possible to listen to playstation audio through headphones connected to pc i know this sounds a bit complicated but is there a way to utilise my pc to listen to the audio output of the ps through headphones the audio from the ps comes through the red and white scart cables and i have an adapter wherby the two cables go into one end of the adapter and the other end is a male headphone connector is there some way to plug this into my pc and route the sound out through my headphones that i can also plug in basically i am trying to find a way of listening to my ps through headphones my tv hasnt got a headphone socket or any other socket just a scart socket thanks ben for the answer can you suggest any software titles i cant find any shareware or freeware would be good the standard ps has three rca outputs red white and yellow they plug into an adapter so you can plug them in to a scart socket the yellow one transmits video and the other two are the left and right audio channels you can adapters from rca to jack sockets what you want is one that converts two rca leads to a female stereo jack which you can plug the headphones straight into if you want to listen to stuff on the computer at the same time then you'll want to have a male jack instead of female then you'd plug that into the microphone input jack socket on the back or front of your computer and then monitor this sound in your computer open up an audio program that takes input and there should be someway of listening to that input as it happens this is usually called monitoring plug the headphones to the computer and voila there's both the computer and the ps through the computer headphones  Jack plug Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis SCART Xbox Amstrad CPC IPod D-subminiature Television S-Video DVD Commodore 64 Headphones Nintendo Entertainment System Loudspeaker XLR connector Xbox 360 Apple IIGS Composite video Microphone Multitrack recording Universal Serial Bus Nintendo GameCube Musical Instrument Digital Interface Bluetooth Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Atari ST Sound card DIN connector Copy protection Atari 8-bit family Modem Mixing console Acorn Electron PC Engine Binaural recording Digital Subscriber Line Commodore 128 RGB color model Sega Saturn Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Synthesizer Computer bus Gender of connectors and fasteners Sound Blaster Walkman Oscilloscope Audiophile PlayStation Portable MP3 Digital Visual Interface Sega Dreamcast Computer hardware ZX Spectrum SAM Coup__ Advanced Technology Attachment Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Nintendo DS USB flash drive Sinclair ZX81 Sega CD Game Boy Original Amiga chipset Nominal impedance S/PDIF Surround sound BS 1363 Digital audio workstation Desktop computer Category 5 cable Stereophonic sound High fidelity Gramophone record GSM services Telephone exchange NTSC Balanced audio ITU-T TurboGrafx 16 Lighting Common Unix Printing System Vacuum tube Sound reinforcement system 8 mm video format Atari 2600 Read-only memory High-definition television Disc jockey PDP-11 Amiga Timeline of computing 1990-forward Gender

computer is switching off hi please help i switch my computer on it boots up ok then it switches it self off again just keeps doing this over and over but sometimes its stays on for a short time i get on the net then a message pops up needing to close any advice would be welcome all the answers up to know are valid solutions but it could be any of these so my advice is try these in this order first run a anti virus and anti spyware scan to cancel out any malware infection this should allways be your first port of call when problems of this nature start happening on your p c then open you case and first give it a good spring clean starting with your c p u fan this gets clogged up with the most dirt and in some cases can stop the p c from booting up correctly i recently fixed a p c with a similar problem to yours it would boot up for minutes and then say it had to shut down to avoid any further damage the reason for this was a blocked cpu fan that the fans would not spin if the p c would continue to boot the cpu would probally fry so this is the reason for some shutdowns also clean the rear fans and any other fans in your p c including the graphics card fan especially check all the cables wires and leadsmmake sure they are all fitted properly and all power leads are correctly fitted have you recently added some new hardware if so your power supply may be struggling especially if its a graphic card in this case upgrade your p s u to a watt model to clean your p c use a air duster which is basically compressed air in a can its easy to use and dosent contain any solvents safe to use after you have checked all this right click my computer advanced start up and recovery then uncheck the box that says automatically restart and press ok this will stop any shutdowns however you still need to find the reason why the p c is shutting down in the first place it sould be a simple fault like a incompatible memory module so check the memory again has this happened since you have upgraded your memory its a case of checking everything until you locate the problem its a long drawn out process but its the only way you will find the problem any problems let me know good luck mate  Mach kernel Windows XP Spyware Windows 2000 CPU design Atari ST CPU cache Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Floppy disk ZX Spectrum Amiga Malware Thread (computer science) Atari 8-bit family Booting AmigaOS IBM PC compatible Debugging Modem Oscilloscope Apple Macintosh Blue screen of death Windows Vista Redundant array of independent disks Central processing unit Buffer overflow Universal Serial Bus Personal computer INMOS Transputer IPod Visual Basic Linux Acorn Electron Computer forensics SAM Coup__ X Window System Second Battle of the Atlantic Embedded system PlayStation Portable M16 (rifle) Microsoft Windows Toyota Prius Commodore 64 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Virtual memory Sinclair ZX81 TRS-80 Cheating in Counter-Strike Space Shuttle program Digital circuit Computer System/36 E-mail spam PlayStation 2 Overclocking Nintendo Entertainment System Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Amstrad CPC Carburetor Tandem Computers Sega Dreamcast Pretty Good Privacy Computer bus Knoppix Federal Standard 1037C PaX Apollo Guidance Computer USB flash drive Spring operating system NX bit Compiler optimization Power-On Self Test Motorola 68000 Commodore 128 File Allocation Table Apple IIGS Emulator Exception handling MDAC 64-bit High-definition television Xbox Xbox 360 PowerPC Motorcycle Rootkit Field-programmable gate array The Amazing Race Pirate decryption Java programming language

dell and alienware why did dell link up with alienware i honestly believe it was mostly based on customer service issues next came marketing a name for alienware alienware as it is by its self had unreliable customer service and was often categorized as being an un worthy computer because of it unfair is how i seen it they are generally great computer systems as such for extreme gamers and people who just prefer the big guns in hardware software technology dell almost over looked the offer but soon realize that it would also generate an even better marketing name for them not only would dell make alienware customer service better but alienware would make sells go sky high for dell and company i think they are going to also link software and such because it would make both dell and alienware more reliable in the near future and make for great partner ship and respect for one another as individual companies setting for the future either way with dell and alienware software being linked i doubt customer service would even exist lol j k  Dell, Inc.

where do i buy parts to build my own pc i'm looking for things like a higher end hard drive good processor good sound card what are the options for the person assembling their own machine if you want to deal with just one retailer go with newegg i build sell and repair puters and i buy of my stuff from them make sure you sign up for their newsletters as they have some really good weekend deals sometimes and its not just old junk they're trying to get rid of but leading edge stuff best thing about using only one retailer is that if you do have a problem they can't blame it on the item you bought from someone else i also use zipzoomfly and mwave on some builds i buy parts from different sources to get the lowest price on everything watch shipping costs some have lower costs but charge for shipping that results in an actual higher cost to you best bet would be to decide what you want then go to each seller put all the stuff into your cart then see what the final cost including shipping would be you may have to click check out to see the shipping charges but thats ok because you wont be charged until a later step as far as an os goes i just got vista ulimate edition bit retail and sealed onebay for just make sure the seller has great feedback and read his feedback and look for buyers who bought the same os and confirm in their feedback that its the real deal  Internet fraud Microeconomics Illegal drug trade Retailer Short selling Mac OS X UK Singles Chart Value added tax History of Microsoft Windows Poker jargon Laptop Supply and demand Arbitrage Atari ST Price discrimination Inventory Tax Commodore 64 Option Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Apple Macintosh Sega Saturn IPod Wal-Mart Bulk vending Auction Real estate broker Warranty Filling station Commodore International Neopets Liberty Dollar FairTax ITunes Music Store Economics Betting (poker) Computer and video games PlayStation 3 Capitalism Overclocking Mutual fund Electrophysiology Online shop Windows Vista Cruising (maritime) DVD Security (finance) Best Buy System/36 PlayStation 2 Modem Islamic banking Commodity E-mail spam System/34 MMORPG Monopoly Citigroup Final Fantasy XI 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Insurance Hyperinflation Blackjack Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Taxation in the United States Sears Holdings Corporation CPU design Wintel USB flash drive Apple II family Sinclair Research Ltd Atari 2600 IMac Windows XP Xbox 360 CPU cache Derivative (finance) Tungsten Handheld Shopping The Apprentice 2 Sound Blaster Audiophile Pornography United States Postal Service Tire Let's Make a Deal Topps The Amazing Race Computer workstation NeXT Airsoft ZX Spectrum Extreme Programming Nintendo 64 Stock

amd or intel which processor is better i plan to use it for web surfing videos some games amd minor programs nothing to extensive i want the pc to be under dollars has any one heard of the amd's burning up intel is generally considered to be the better processor by people in the it industry while it is true that amd processors used to have their problems with overheating and other operational limitations in the early days of the company most of those flaws have been corrected now and the processor is generally problem free however intel processors usually process instructions faster due to their hyper threading technology and dual core processing whcih means that they process instructions on dual channels at the same time to give you twice the speed of a normal cpu not to mention that intel is the more popular and are the more well known cpu with a longer proven track record also most pcs usually have intel chips in them including dell computers hewlett packards and macbook pros therefore if you have the choice between to comparable computers of the same or similar prices most professional and home computers users would select the computer with the intel cpu over the amd however from what it sounds like you are going to be using the computer for your focus should probably be which computer is more affordable and practical for you to buy instead of which processor is best most home users never even notice the difference or utilize the cpu to its fullest extent good luck with your research and i'm sure you will be fine whatever you decide  Pentium 4 Cyrix CPU design Microprocessor Computer workstation Computer MIPS architecture X86 Windows XP Athlon Celeron PowerPC History of Microsoft Windows Apple Macintosh Linux kernel Personal computer X86 assembly language Timeline of computing 1990-forward Wintel Overclocking Atari ST Microsoft Windows Dual-core Apple Intel transition Mac OS X History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Atari 8-bit family NVIDIA IBM PC Opteron VIA Technologies Intel MOS Technology 6502 Sun Microsystems AMD64 Mach kernel Athlon 64 X2 GeForce 6 Series Xeon Transmeta ATI Technologies Supercomputer Pentium Pentium III Intel iAPX 432 ARM architecture Linux Mainframe computer Hewlett-Packard Windows Vista Zilog Z80 Thread (computer science) Graphics processing unit Laptop Symmetric multiprocessing Compiler optimization Moore's law Cell (microprocessor) Apple II family VIA C3 MP3 Clock rate IA-64 Athlon 64 Digital Equipment Corporation Buffer overflow Acorn Computers Burroughs B5000 Operating system Field-programmable gate array NeXT ZX Spectrum Pentium D DragonFly BSD Embedded system MOS Technology INMOS Transputer PlayStation 2 SIMD Computer multitasking Commodore 64 CDC 6600 Amstrad CPC CP/M Front side bus Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Mac OS X v10.4 PDP-11

i have a gateway desktop that i want to restore can i use the recovery disks from my hp laptop to do it my gateway desktop needs to be restored and i can not find the recovery disks for it i recently bought a hp laptop and have the recovery disks for that will it work to use them first thing you need to know was your desktop using the same version of windows as the laptop example windows xp home or pro sp example windows xp home or pro sp second does the desktop have a windows genuine product key sticker on the side of it's case if it does have it's own product key that product key will only work on the version of windows that was originally installed on the desktop so lets say your desktop came with windowsxp media home sp and your laptop came with windows xp home sp the key for the desktop will not work on the disk that came with the laptop the product and version have to be exactly the same you should not use the product keycode from the laptop on the desktop because it will need to be activated that key is already registered to the laptop both machines will need a seperate product key for it's os if both machines were using the same version of windows and you have two product keys after you install the hp disk to the gateway you are going to have to go over to the gateway website support drivers section put in the make model of the gateway and download all the drivers for that machine because the hp disk will not have them are you sure your gateway came with disks it might be possible that the gateway came with a windows image recovery which is located on the d partition of the hard drive when you boot up the gateway and it's on the black bootup screen do you see an option to press example f for setup if you see that option on the black boot up screen then use that option if it asks for a disk then your s o l if it brings up a recovery screen follow the directions on how to recover it using the windows xp image recovery good luck  Windows 2000 Windows Vista Hard disk IBM PC compatible History of Microsoft Windows Apple Macintosh Laptop AmigaOS Blue screen of death Linux System 7 (Macintosh) Microsoft Windows Atari ST SUSE Linux Floppy disk Bluetooth USB flash drive Knoppix Stardock Booting Windows Server 2003 File Allocation Table PowerBook Redundant array of independent disks Mac OS X Macintosh Finder Partition (computing) Desktop computer Object Desktop IBook TRS-80 Apple Computer NTFS Steam (content delivery) Mandriva Linux LiveCD ThinkPad PlayStation 2 ATI Technologies Atari 8-bit family WordStar Personal computer Apple II family Windows 3.x Windows Me Computer forensics DOS NeXT Commodore 128 Radeon File system Architecture of Windows 2000 Copy protection Microsoft BIOS VAIO Screenshot IMac Commodore International Mouse (computing) Power Macintosh G3 MAME IBM PC DR-DOS Television Kazaa Microprocessor OS/2 GNOME Symbian OS Wi-Fi X Window System Backup Windows Mobile Forth programming language Google Desktop Macromedia Flash Creative Zen OpenBSD Microsoft Office Pretty Good Privacy Kaypro Desknote Acorn Archimedes QuickTime Boot image FreeDOS Common Unix Printing System Computer hardware

i need you badly i am goin to die well some guyson the net and websites been saying that the dell dimension c is a bad computer but the tech specs say other wise look i beg you my components amd athlon x dual core genuine windows vista home premium gb dual channel ddr sdram at mhz dimms gb serial ata hard drive rpm w databurst cache x dvd rw drive mb ati radeon x integrated channel audio dell usb keyboard and dell optical usb mouse no floppy drive included k pci data fax modem is this a really suck computer and cant play games and cant do studd like civ and the lates pc games and cant do basic stuff answer me yes or no i need you ty for you time ps will the lates games and civ sims empire earth golden etc work on the vista program installed on my pc ty for your time it does not necessarily suck it just is not a higher end gaming system a dell xps series system would be a better choice for gaming if affordable the cost can quickly mount up to several thousand dollars if you get the latest greatest technology with all the fancy bells and whistles included the rule in buying gaming machines is to get the best that you can afford you will just have to check the specific minimum system requirements for each game to determine if they will work with your system and are vista compatible vista still has a lot of compatibility problems to address for now some games software components and periphreals simply will not work on a vista system vista is not yet really ready for some of the higher end games either many games actually run slower on vista than they do on windows xp also vista uses more memory but gbs should be sufficient for now however vista comes with directx backward compatible to c which some newer games utilize for better graphics and sound the processor should be adequate for most current games and some newer ones the mb ati radeon x although supposedly certified for vista is an older video card that may be borderline for the next generation games again you will just have to check the games minimum system requirements to determine if they will work with this card or save up for a better one later for gaming if there is a choice i would recommend using windows xp until microsoft works out some of the compatibility problems and releases their first service pack sometime next year microsoft is really pushing vista even though it still has problems after the end of this year microsoft will no longer allow oem manufacturers of new systems such as dell to install or sell xp by the way service pack for windows xp may be released early next year if the current pre beta testing goes well they will not commit to any approximate release date for vista service pack so it may be awhile  Microsoft Windows Linux Mac OS X Atari ST 3dfx DDR2 SDRAM IBM PC 64-bit Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sound Blaster Microprocessor Amstrad CPC Microsoft Bluetooth CPU design Windows 3.x Windows Server 2003 AmigaOS DVD Sega Dreamcast Amiga The Sims 2 IBook GeForce 4 Central processing unit CPU cache Secure Digital card History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Nintendo GameCube Computer VIA Technologies IPod Apple Computer Computer and video games AMD Pentium 4 Mouse (computing) X Window System Sega Saturn MIPS architecture PowerBook Commodore International Apple IIGS Athlon Desktop computer Radeon X Series PlayStation Portable Athlon 64 RISC Doom 3 X86 PC motherboard Overclocking Copy protection Blue screen of death TRS-80 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Opteron Commodore 128 TRS-80 Color Computer Cyrix System/36 MS-DOS

can i reinstall windows on my dell can i do this myself i know how to or do i have to send it to dell can you understand that i already know how to do it i know how to reformat partitions make new ones etc i just want to fix it for my buddy i reinstall windows on my custom pc all the time i just want to know if they have to retarded rule or program that makes it send it to them because its dell it depends on a couple things do you have all the installation cd's windows driver files have you backed up all the data that's important and stored all the information required to reconfigure email and internet have you done this before imho if you have not done it before get some help or send it off if you have then go ahead i would strongly recommend formatting the drive before re installing if you decide to go ahead then basically re boot the computer with the windows cd in the drive during re boot it should ask if you want to boot from cd say yes once into the setup program follow the prompts and make sure you choose new installation at the drive assignments delete them first then re create the partition this ensures the drive will be formatted before proceeding this can be a risky process if you don't have the drivers and do not have another computer handy to connect to the internet to get drivers before starting i suggest to go to the dell web site enter the express service code and download all the drivers onto a mem stick or burn them onto a cd for use when you have finished the installation during the installation just make sure to read all the prompts and understand what they say again if you have not done it before then i suggest getting some help or sending it away the nice thing about installing yourself is then you don't have a lot of excess programs and settings just plain windows and drivers to start with you will notice it runs quite good before all the crap of a couple years drags it down good luck brad  Windows XP Linux Windows 2000 Computer virus AmigaOS MDAC Knoppix Booting Partition (computing) Spyware Pretty Good Privacy Common Unix Printing System File system ITunes Hard disk Virtual memory Portable Document Format DOS Redundant array of independent disks Gmail USB flash drive System 7 (Macintosh) Windows registry Domain Name System System/36 CPU cache Microsoft Windows Malware Perl Novell NetWare Disk cloning IPod MS-DOS IBM PC compatible Computer forensics NTFS Computer Modem Rootkit Windows 3.x Copy protection E-mail spam XML Logo programming language Java programming language System/34 MAME MP3 History of Microsoft Windows OS/2 Unicode Windows Vista Windows Server 2003 Commodore 64 Floppy disk Web crawler PaX Expert system E-mail Digital rights management Architecture of Windows 2000 Extreme Programming Surveillance Bluetooth OpenOffice.org Blue screen of death CPU design Linked list AOL Instant Messenger X Window System Disk formatting Internet Relay Chat Atari 8-bit family Btrieve Online music store Common criticisms of Microsoft Filename extension Microsoft Jet Database Engine Digital photography PNG DragonFly BSD Debugging Library (computer science) Trusted computing Apple Computer Data retention Macromedia Flash HTTP cookie Outlook Express Enterprise content management Stopping e-mail abuse Computer security GIF Visual Basic

thinking of building my own computer ok i want to build my computer can i use the computer case that i have now like the this computer i am typing on for this question basicly can i just gut this think and put in spankin new hardware the comp i am usin' is a compaq presario it has been good to me over the years but i want an entertainment gaming monster that i can say i built with my own hands i would have to make sure all parts are compatible how would i do this would say on the package it comes in or would i have to do research for that and is building comp really just making sure you have a good power supply and making sure the parts are compatible is installing everything really big hastle alienware makes out to be i just want a computer with very good gaming cuality and good for editing or making videos with kick ass memory and stuff oh if you know how coul you tell how to build my own cuality computer case i am still searching for a comp store so dont worry bout that thanks thanks for all your help but i forgot what tools would i need for building one cant believ i forgot to add that first off you need to know what is the classification of your casing so that you'll be sure that your new motherboard will fit atx cases are the common cases today if you can't readily classify it just measure it and bring the measurements when you buy your parts a good research will always be needed for your new cpu contrary to your statement it is not really just about making sure all parts are compatible first you need to determine the primary purpose of your computer the amount of speed and computing capability is reliant on this if you will be a hardcore gamer video editor i would strongly recommend an intel core duo or core quad if your budget permits you can research for benchmarks to compare processors a decent board that supports core quad dual ram channeling and at least x gig ram a high end video cards for games a spacious hard disk more than gig for future investment and a reliable power supply you can throw in an lcd monitor for minimum power consumption and a good sound system basically it depends on your interest if you'll going to enjoy the process or not especially since for me building a new cpu doesn't mean that i'll just be buying from a single store it is a lot of hard work and price comparisons but its all worth it  Computer RISC Central processing unit Atari ST Personal computer Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis CPU design Laptop AMD CPU cache IBM PC Xbox 360 PlayStation 2 Windows XP Overclocking Commodore 64 Amstrad CPC Sega Saturn TRS-80 Color Computer Windows 2000 PlayStation Portable Universal Serial Bus Microprocessor Apple Macintosh PC motherboard Apple II family Redundant array of independent disks Commodore 128 History of computing hardware (1960s-present) PowerPC Windows Vista ATI Technologies Mac OS X Amiga Timeline of computing 1990-forward 64-bit Linux Hard disk Commodore International PC Engine Apple Computer TurboGrafx 16 History of Microsoft Windows INMOS Transputer Sega Dreamcast Atari 2600 AmigaOS Super Nintendo Entertainment System Embedded system Sound card 3dfx Nintendo GameCube Random access memory NVIDIA MSX GeForce 6 Series Microsoft Cyrix Commodore PET Floppy disk Dynamic random access memory Motorola 68000 Computer and video games Acorn Electron System 7 (Macintosh) PowerBook Video game music Celeron Desktop computer Wintel IMac Virtual memory Computer hardware Supercomputer File Allocation Table Sound Blaster Password NX bit NeXT Memory (computers) Graphics processing unit Nintendo DS Nintendo Revolution Compaq Linux kernel BBC Micro Computer case Forth programming language

which amd clock speed i am currently considering purchasing an amd x duel core cpu i am stuck whether to opt for the ghz or the ghz sounds like a stupid question but i'm on a really tight budget and if i invest more in the cpu i won't be able to spend as much on a graphics card any advice welcome by the way i am intending to game with this pc also like to add that i live in the u k if you are on a budget then you should definately invest the money in the graphics card much more important for gaming than the cpu amds are actually better for the money at the moment unless you plan to overclock then you can get more out of the intels do try to get one with a good amount of cache though because in fact that is fairly important for gaming  AMD Pentium 4 Celeron Athlon Overclocking CPU cache Microprocessor Cyrix RISC MIPS architecture Front side bus Computer Clock rate Xeon IBM PC compatible Pentium III PlayStation 3 Opteron Athlon 64 Pentium D Duron Cell (microprocessor) PC motherboard CPU design PR rating Itanium 2 Pentium M VIA C3 X86 Xbox 360 AMD 5x86 GeForce 6 Series Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis VIA Technologies Dual-core NForce4 Atari ST Computer workstation ATI Technologies Northbridge (computing) Windows XP Radeon 3dfx NVIDIA Transmeta Nintendo Revolution Xbox Nintendo GameCube PlayStation 2 64-bit Far Cry Apple Intel transition IMac Zilog Z80 CPU electrical consumption Athlon 64 X2 Personal computer PowerBook AltiVec Counter-Strike Pentium AMD64 AMD K6-2 FLOPS History of Microsoft Windows Montecito HyperTransport Atari 2600 Computer bus X86 assembly language IBM POWER Computer and video game industry Symmetric multiprocessing Amiga Windows Vista Nintendo 64 BBC Micro Intel 80386 Gross domestic product Graphics processing unit Windows 3.x Commodore 64 AMD 29000 Timeline of computing 1990-forward ZX Spectrum Atari 8-bit family Sempron Wintel DDR2 SDRAM Intel Microsoft Windows History of computing hardware IBM PC

computer will not turn on worked fine last night this morning the tower is dead no lights blinking and on the moniter it says check connections and powerw suppy did all that more than once still no light blinking front of tower no light on on back no fan running thanks for any help it sounds like the power supply if there's no lights at all first thing to check is the cord in the wall make sure the power strip is on and that the light on the strip is on if there isn't a strip and you're plugged straight into the wall then try an entirely new plug that you've tested with a light once you know the plug works and you plug in check the power supply that's the socket where the tower plug goes in it's usually triangular and sometimes it looks plugged in but it's slipped out just a bit if you still get nothing it's time to open the case when the case is open with the power supply on and plugged in then you should see a red or green light on the main board of electronics if there isn't one it's time to check the power supplies connection to the board itself that sometimes comes unplugged if that's not it the only other hope is that you have a nd computer that you can borrow the power supply from and test the computer then you should know if you need to buy a whole new power supply they only cost about for one that will run the best systems around so it's not a huge expense  Domestic AC power plugs and sockets BS 1363 Personal computer Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Universal Serial Bus Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Jack plug Power strip Nintendo Entertainment System Fuse (electrical) Embedded system Modem Bicycle lighting Thermal power station Three-phase electric power Spark plug System/36 Traffic light D-subminiature Laptop Commodore 64 Alternating current Wire wrap Movie projector USB flash drive STS-61 Debugging Atari 8-bit family Electrical wiring (UK) Telephone exchange Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster IBM PC compatible Carburetor Television NVIDIA Strap-on dildo Residual-current device Solar power Computer forensics Apollo Guidance Computer Commodore 128 Sears Holdings Corporation Airport Gender of connectors and fasteners X10 (industry standard) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Mains electricity Power cord Battery electric vehicle Distribution board Sinclair ZX81 CPU cache Docklands Light Railway Lighting IPod Drag racing Power supply Audiophile Capacitor plague Advanced Technology Attachment Reading spark plugs for racing Nintendo 64 Violin Electric motor Musical Instrument Digital Interface Mach kernel Transformer Acorn Electron Digital circuit Oscilloscope TGV Cheating in Counter-Strike Fencing Dundas Square Extension Cord Vacuum tube Overclocking Incandescent light bulb Christmas lights Fluorescent lamp Athlon Europlug Two-stroke cycle Conan the Barbarian Poker jargon Computer and video games Canon T90 Socket Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Wood Public-key cryptography Hearing aid SCART Mahjong AT form factor Money supply Electricity meter Diesel engine Mouse (computing)

windows vista bit or bit my computer detail cpu intel core duo motherboard asus p k ram umax ddr x gb hdd western digital gb graphic card nx gt oc i would recommend bit if you can i have bit vista premium and it detected and installed successfully all basic hardware drivers from the install cd video sound motherboard etc without any issues if you have some really old devices you might have some problems but most modern stuff works fine for example i have some old palm pda's that i still use and the the usb sync cradles do not have vista drivers that work for both bit and bit vista i was able to get around it by using serial cables which don't need a driver so as you can see from the above if you have really old stuff that you still like to use vista can be a pain but there are sometimes workarounds either way bit is the future and it's a shame not to use it when you have a bit chip  Windows Vista Universal Serial Bus History of Microsoft Windows ATI Technologies Windows XP PowerPC Sound card Personal computer PlayStation Portable IBM PC compatible Secure Digital card Bluetooth Computer bus Atari ST Microsoft Windows NVIDIA PlayStation 2 Apple Macintosh Linux OpenGL IPod ZX Spectrum Sharp Zaurus Hard disk Desktop computer Microprocessor 64-bit Commodore 64 Modem Sound Blaster RS-232 Graphics processing unit AmigaOS Computer hardware Video Graphics Array Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 Random access memory TRS-80 Embedded system IBM PC X Window System Dynamic random access memory Central processing unit Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Opteron USB flash drive Timeline of computing 1990-forward Computer Atari 8-bit family TRS-80 Color Computer Commodore 128 Apple IIGS Original Amiga chipset CPU design Virtual memory Motherboard Xbox Amiga Wintel Cyrix Radeon CPU cache Power Macintosh G3 MIPS architecture GeForce 6 Series Northbridge (computing) 3dfx Graphics card PC Engine Ethernet Capacitor plague Motorola 68000 RISC Game port Personal digital assistant Microsoft Fritz-chip Flash memory Sinclair ZX81 Commodore PET INMOS Transputer Windows 2000 Device driver Pentium D Modchip Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis MOS Technology Windows Server 2003 Tungsten Handheld Amstrad CPC Mac OS X Mouse (computing) Advanced Technology Attachment

what's the difference between the new imac and the old one i was gonna buy the old imac but it seems that it's not on apple com anymore it was the second option i remember and costed about and it used superdrive or something the new imac the first option costs the same and runs on superdrive is there anything that's worse than the old imac i was gonna buy it's the same thing really mainly they just did an update on the outside but nothing really on the inside they only thing that is different inside is that they added a faster graphics card also if you're looking at it from a recyclable point of view it's made of glass and aluminum so it will be better for recycling oh and the first option now on the new imac is the same as the second option on the old one  IMac Apple Macintosh PowerBook IBook Mac OS X PowerBook G4 Apple Computer Power Macintosh G3 IPod Floppy disk Mac mini Mac OS X v10.2 NeXT Steve Jobs Atari 8-bit family ILife AirPort IBM PC compatible Timeline of computing 1990-forward Capacitor plague AlphaSmart USB flash drive Mac OS 8 Windows 2000 Recycling Microsoft Windows Counter-Strike AmigaOS Power Mac G5 MAME Windows Vista Apple IIGS IBM Personal System/2 Desktop computer Yellow Dog Linux Radeon Blackjack Power Mac G4 Cube 64-bit Apple II family HyperCard FoxTrot PowerPC Chromatography Plastic 3dfx Bong Mac OS history Windows XP Copland PostScript Laptop Redundant array of independent disks Linux PDP-11 Personal computer Gramophone record Winning Streak Mac OS X v10.1 PCI Express Graphics processing unit Homestar Runner BASIC programming language Neopets PowerPC G4 Handloading Faster-than-light TRS-80 Microeconomics Commodore International Modem RISC The Sims 2 Kaypro Baseball Stars Gross domestic product ITunes Music Store X Window System Old World ROM Amateur telescope making Visual Basic Amiga Sega Saturn SGI Indy System/36 Jonathan Ive Mac OS X v10.0 Star Trek Customizable Card Game Computer Mouse (computing) Commodore 64 Power Macintosh Nintendo Revolution Hydrogen economy History of Microsoft Windows Ultima Online Fuzion Coprocessor Mario Bros.

any computer tips i know about the usual things you need to do to keep your computer safe and running well like having spyware and adaware software but are there any other things i should be doing not doing to make sure i don't mess up my laptop i'd advise getting a good anti virus program installed avg is free and is pretty good http free grisoft com if you've got the money i'd suggest getting kaspersky's antivirus as it is probably the best one on the market http www kaspersky com other than that just be carefull where you enter personal details on the internet look for https rather than http in the internet address bar when entering personal information as this indicates a secure connection perform regular disk defragmentation and error checking once a month to do this double click on the my computer icon and then right click on your c drive select properties then from the tools tab there are options to error check and defragment they can take a bit of time depending on the size of your hard disk bigger longer but your computer will apreciate it that's about all i can think of but should get you started  Anti-virus software Windows XP Floppy disk Computer virus Windows 2000 HTTP cookie Mozilla Firefox Virtual memory HyperText Transfer Protocol Uniform Resource Locator Malware Computer security Rootkit Bluetooth Password AmigaOS Internet security Common Unix Printing System Embedded system Computer Stopping e-mail abuse Macromedia Flash Defragmentation Gmail USB flash drive Internet fraud Blue screen of death Web server IPod Object Desktop MSN Messenger Transmission Control Protocol Skype Python programming language IBM PC Internet CPU cache E-mail Denial-of-service attack World Wide Web Surveillance Mouse (computing) IBM PC compatible Microsoft Windows Kazaa Domain Name System Amstrad CPC Wi-Fi Apple Macintosh Phishing HyperCard Ethernet Mac OS X Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Secure Digital card Computer surveillance RuneScape cheats Google Firewall (networking) Streaming media Mydoom Commodore 64 Web crawler ITunes Thin client Mach kernel Timeline of computing 1990-forward Comparison of web browsers System/36 E-mail spam Trojan horse (computing) Screenshot Computer forensics Partition (computing) Opera (web browser) Buffer overflow Page table Windows Vista PHP Knoppix Software engineering Linux Copy protection Java programming language Apple II family Visual Basic NeXT Atari 8-bit family

pc issues files no longer there my pc froze up a few days ago so i had no choice but to turn it off my holding the power button in for a few seconds the problem was when i turned it back on the next day the pc acted like it was the first time i turned on ever like i just bought it asking me how i connect to the internet etc the settings i want to use etc and ive had this pc for almost a year well that for the most part is taken care off if nothing else it was annoying to go through the real issue is i am missing a lot of files for example my napster program is still on my pc but my music files are gone microsoft money is on my pc but my file i use that has all my financial info on it is missing like i have programs still on the pc that i installed after i first got it but a lot of the files i use with them are missing now could it be that i had a created directory the files were in and now they are just misplaced its hard for me to believe that the files just got deleted but most programs are fine if you have pertinent info you need in microsoft money it would be wise to take it to a reputable technician to recover the files if your daring then try system restore in the system tools of your programs to a time earlier than the malfunction remember when using system restore that anything you did from the time chosen to now will be deleted you can always download your napster stuff again if it isn't copyrighted material number one rule backup and often good luck  File sharing Windows XP AmigaOS ITunes Microsoft Windows MDAC Online music store Linux Backup MP3 Peer-to-peer Windows Me Napster Computer virus Internet Relay Chat Digital rights management Macromedia Flash File system IPod Spyware MAME Microsoft Mouse (computing) Embedded system Copyright infringement of software Computer security Gnutella Kazaa Windows Server 2003 Windows registry Nintendo Malware NTFS E-mail System 7 (Macintosh) TeX BitTorrent Public domain Copy protection Screenshot Steam (content delivery) Java programming language SCO-Linux controversies Wget Windows 2000 Trusted computing History of Microsoft Windows Poker jargon Domain Name System Novell NetWare Library (computer science) Mozilla Firefox File Allocation Table ITunes Music Store Windows Installer Filename extension Pretty Good Privacy GunZ The Duel Streaming media System/36 Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Pitaten Cheating in Counter-Strike ROM image Btrieve Computer insecurity SonicStage Symbolic link Redundant array of independent disks System/34 Disk cloning DCPlusPlus OpenDocument ZX Spectrum Virtual memory Rootkit Year 2000 problem Computer Doctor Who missing episodes Floppy disk PHP Outlook Express Napster (pay service) Digital circuit Computer file Mac OS X Debugging IBM PC compatible WordStar CPU cache Podcasting Emacs Concurrent Versions System Microsoft .NET Pump It Up Justin Frankel Oracle database

which is better sli or crossfire i'm building a top end gaming pc and was going to use two evga e geforce ultra black pearls in sli my question is do ati do a crossfire equivilent that matches or would better this setup i have a very large budget as i've just recieved a large sum of money from my insurance after crashing my supercar unfortunately i'll have to get a smaller car to get insured again but good news is i'll have about grand to spend building my new pc and so want the absolute best from what i've read crossfire is actually more feature rich as when one card isn't doing anything it works on antianalysing where as sli does nothing the only thing is i don't think there are any cards by ati better than the nvidea ultras ps i have had both nvidea and ati cards before and am unbiased to either company i think they are both good brands and would prefer this question to look at the facts and not become a personal slagging match over who thinks which manufacturer is better the s have been performing better in benchmarks than the ati equivalent but the transfer into gaming performance will be unnoticeable to be honest same with sli v crossfire at the level of card you are looking at anything you can throw at it will work fine what we don't know a great deal about is actual directx performance as this is going to be the main driver for graphics development over the next couple of years i would hold off getting your cards for a few months until some decent games come out which will really use the technology and allow a more objective assessment if you really need want your pc up and running now why not buy an interim card so that you don't have to stare at that unused case in the corner depending on which option you go with you could get a relatively low spec card and re sell it once you have had a chance to make a firm decision will also give you an idea how the rest of your set up performs prior to fitting a grand or more's worth of gfx hope this helps and whatever you go for i'm sure that it is going to be an excellent system  Radeon NVIDIA GeForce 6 Series 3dfx GeForce FX GeForce Poker jargon IBM PC compatible Radeon X Series GeForce 2 Doom 3 Windows Vista OpenGL Xbox Nintendo Revolution CPU cache Scalable Link Interface DDR2 SDRAM Graphics card Counter-Strike Nintendo Nintendo GameCube Microeconomics GeForce 7 Series The Sims 2 NForce4 Blackjack Hard disk GeForce 3 PlayStation 3 Doomsday argument GeForce 256 Ethics Yu-Gi-Oh!

what do i need i want to make my computer for gaming music and videos i would like to know whats the best hardware i should get also is a u d motherbord outdated if not can the whats the best processor and video card that can be installed on it oh is ddr ram any good if not what shold i get thanks for your help what does the rest of your system look like your motherboard doesn't seem too outdated however i think most people prefer pci to agp slots nowadays especially with regards to gaming there are some good agp graphics cards out there just remember to make sure your cpu and ram is powerfull enough to run effectively whatever graphics card you get with regards to ram it all depends on what your motherboard can take do some research on your board and see whether it takes ddr ddr or whatever i think your board only takes ddr ram i could be wrong if your serious about upgrading your pc for games get ready to spend some money with the advent of directx cards and games system requirements have shot through the roof if your looking to play the next generation games you might as well upgrade your motherboard agp is pretty much dead whether you choose between pentium or amd is up to you remember nvidia are launching their geforce series video cards later this year so the prices for the series are gonna drop dramatically look at the or also its way better to build up your own pc than to buy one from a retailer its much cheaper youd be surprised at the markups retailers put on their hardware i'm no expert so the best thing to do is to trawl the gaming forums where you'll get an idea of what you need for the price your willing to pay you can check the prices for various hardware by simply googling them hope this helps somewhat  Personal computer Radeon Graphics processing unit PC motherboard IBM PC compatible GeForce FX Xbox GeForce 4 Overclocking GeForce 7 Series PlayStation 3 Windows Vista IMac Pentium 4 Apple Macintosh Amiga Computer hardware PlayStation 2 Accelerated Graphics Port NForce2 Atari ST Commodore 64 ZX Spectrum GeForce 2 Northbridge (computing) RISC AMD Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis DDR2 SDRAM Expansion card NForce4 Graphics card Windows XP Cyrix Counter-Strike PowerPC VIA Technologies Wintel Motherboard GeForce In The Groove (game) Peripheral Component Interconnect Opteron CPU cache IBM PC Radeon X Series Front side bus CPU design Microprocessor Apple IIGS TRS-80 Color Computer Mac OS X Computer and video games History of Microsoft Windows Dynamic random access memory Dance Dance Revolution Xbox 360 PC Engine World of Warcraft Central processing unit Apple II family HyperTransport Game programming Sound Blaster PCI Express Atari 8-bit family Nintendo Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Power Mac G4 BBC Micro Laptop Voodoo 5 Nintendo Entertainment System MSX MicroATX Internet fraud GeForce 256 Celeron Scalable Link Interface Sega Saturn Game Boy Intel Commodore 128 Far Cry Modem TurboGrafx 16 Nintendo 64 AmigaOS DirectX Nintendo Revolution

my father put windows vista on my computer i hate it how do i get it off my computer i would like to got back to windows xp any suggetions on how i can do this myself you can get a hold of an old windows xp cd and reformat the computer with it usually when u put the cd in and boot up your computer it asks if you want to boot from the cd so you do that and it pretty much takes it from there all you have to do is watch and hit a couple buttons and configure the computer and tell it to format the hard drive but doing so will cause you to lose everything on your computer like your software you have loaded on your computer and word files pictures and music but it will also run alot faster after so do so at your own risk  IPod Windows XP Microsoft Windows AmigaOS Linux Mouse (computing) Booting USB flash drive IBM PC compatible Computer virus Windows 2000 File system Partition (computing) Apple Macintosh Apple II family Screenshot File Allocation Table BIOS Disk cloning Windows Vista Hard disk Windows registry FreeDOS Sony Computer forensics Personal computer Windows Server 2003 NTFS Windows 3.x DOS Floppy disk Microsoft System/36 System 7 (Macintosh) History of Microsoft Windows Portable Document Format MS-DOS Dual boot Redundant array of independent disks ITunes History of the graphical user interface Mac OS X v10.4 Mac OS X Virtual memory Library (computer science) MIPS architecture Windows 95 Knoppix Xbox Embedded system Apple Computer Blue screen of death NeXT Atari 8-bit family Mandriva Linux Computer software Hello world program Server NTLDR MAME Atari ST Operating system PlayStation 2 Ebook Data remanence Macintosh Finder WordStar Kernel (computer science) Filename extension Digital photography Common Unix Printing System Stardock RAM disk Btrieve Proxy server OS/2 Classic (Mac OS X) Fritz-chip Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Computer and video games Forth programming language Thread (computer science) Data General Nova SAM Coup__ NX bit ZX Spectrum Emacs Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis IMac PlayStation Portable Object Desktop Commodore 64 Computer program Appliance Acorn Electron GRand Unified Bootloader Computer Macromedia Flash IA-64

damaged hard drive surface on xp i ran pc doctor and when it checks the hard drive it fails i tried checkdisk and it repaired the bad sectors but it still comes up that the hard drive has a demaged surface is there anything i can do to fix that or my last resort is to do system recovery and put it back to original factory state i even tried system restore but it didn't work please someone help thank you your hard drive seems to be failing no system restore software is going to help perform immediate data backup and recovery to save all your critical documents next get a hard disk diagnostic software free of charge from seagate wd maxtor and do a low level format of your hard disk sometimes weak magnetic properties on the disk surface gets interpreted as bad sectors a low level format may help to rectify the problem after low level format do a system format to partition the hard disk to your preference if you still encounter bad sectors here you will need to replace your hard disk for good if no bad sectors are encountered you may continue to use the same hard disk however you must monitor the hard disk condition for a few weeks to ensure everything is spiffy and good the answers given earlier are all good and true i just added on cheers everybody  Hard disk Redundant array of independent disks Floppy disk Computer virus Backup Embedded system Partition (computing) Disk formatting Apple II family File Allocation Table File system Disk cloning Data recovery Disk storage Virtual memory Atari 8-bit family Amstrad CPC Computer forensics Atari ST System/36 Cache Computer IBM PC Year 2000 problem AmigaOS Enterprise content management Apollo Guidance Computer Knoppix NTFS PlayStation 2 Booting System/34 Windows XP Disk image BIOS Early IBM disk storage Oscilloscope Modchip ZX Spectrum Macintosh Finder Linux Digital photography Plaintext Seagate Technology Xbox Pretty Good Privacy Western Digital MP3 FireWire Database Universal Serial Bus Files-11 TransUnion Commodore 64 FreeDOS System 7 (Macintosh) Windows Vista SAM Coup__ Information Technology Infrastructure Library Motorola 68000 Sound recording Compact disc Debugging Zip drive IBM PC compatible Digital rights management Personal computer Page table Computer security Control Data Corporation Commodore 1541 Maxtor Corporation Vacuum tube CP/M Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Blue screen of death TRS-80 Color Computer Reliability engineering CPU design Sega Dreamcast Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina ISO 9000 DOS Seismic retrofit CPU cache Malware Buffer overflow Bicycle lighting

wanting to upgrade my processor from pent to dual core i have a gateway gm all specs are here http support gateway com s pc r nv shtml only thing different is that i replaced the video card with a radeon x pro mb want to know if it's even possible to upgrade well gateway doesn't give any specs on what processors the motherboard supports i seriously doubt it could accept any decent dual core processors pentium d is a waste of and for gaming wouldn't perform any better than your pentium ht it would involve a few steps not just one first you'd have to replace the motherboard with one that either accepts amd x or intel core duo then you'll be buying new memory unless you found a socket mobo that could accept your existing ram add an amd x or and you've boosted your system significantly for a core duo motherboard cpu your existing ram would have to be replaced as well  Pentium 4 PC motherboard AMD Cyrix Celeron ATI Technologies CPU cache X86 VIA Technologies Microprocessor Apple Macintosh Xeon NVIDIA Timeline of computing 1990-forward Radeon Opteron AMD 5x86 PowerPC IBM PC compatible AMD K6-2 Front side bus 64-bit Overclocking X86 assembly language Dual-core RISC Pentium II Athlon 64 Sound Blaster IBM PC Pentium AMD64 Windows XP History of Microsoft Windows Pentium Pro IA-32 IMac PC Engine Socket 939 NX bit Graphics processing unit Motherboard Pentium III NForce4 Laptop 3dfx VIA C3 Symmetric multiprocessing TRS-80 Color Computer Apple IIGS Linux kernel Northbridge (computing) Amiga Wintel Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis PR rating CPU design MIPS architecture AMD K6-III MSX Intel PlayStation 3 Power Macintosh G3 Capacitor plague Central processing unit Transmeta Nintendo Revolution Atari 8-bit family Commodore 64 Apple Intel transition IA-64 Mac OS Sempron ZX Spectrum GeForce 2 Computer workstation DDR2 SDRAM Intel i860 PlayStation 2 Cyrix Cx5x86 Duron DEC Alpha BBC Micro Windows Vista Radeon X Series Intel 80386 Cell (microprocessor) Athlon 64 X2 Computer Hyper-threading AMD K6 GeForce 4 Intel i960

reformated and it keeps crashing obviously i'm on a different computer i went to clean my computer with dust cleaner for electronics i removed my ati pro to clean the fan blades i put it back in it wasn't seated correctly i removed it and reseated it the prongs weren't correctly hitting the pci e firmly now my computer reads nothing i managed to get some windows updates but when i go to download service pack and others it just crashes i own registry mechanic i have defragged i took the card out and defaulted to the integrated graphics that came with this my power supply is fine its a enermax i can do some things but it didn't fully restore my gigs of saved stuff tho it saved some of it i can get on the internet but things aren't loading or displaying right my java is fine i run no scripts on firefox this is a new computer it handles oblivion just fine i built it myself it's not old yes it was a full system restore i'm beginning to think i i fried my card but when i revert to the old settings the integrated graphics it still crashes i saved all the updates on disk i went and ran it with just the integrated graphics ati it's still crashing trend micro panda and ad adware have come up with nothing arghhhhhhhhhhhhhh yes it reads the pro as the primary device first off it's possible that you damaged your motherboard by powering up the system when the video card was not seated correctly assuming this isn't the case and your mobo is okay when you went back to the integrated video did you remove the drivers for your ati in the device manager does it detect the correct video card hardware in the display properties does it show the right video hardware and driver software to go with it did you update the driver software that goes with your integrated video i'm thinking there might be a mismatch between the video drivers that are currently loaded on your system and the integrated video on your motherboard try to make sure everything is consistent and i'd remove the old ati drivers just to be certain  Windows XP Windows 2000 ATI Technologies Windows Vista Radeon Floppy disk Commodore 64 AmigaOS NVIDIA IBM PC compatible OpenGL X Window System Debugging History of Microsoft Windows Microsoft Windows ZX Spectrum Spyware Nintendo Entertainment System Computer and video games Hard disk Apple IIGS Blue screen of death IPod Computer hardware Redundant array of independent disks GeForce 6 Series 3dfx Atari 8-bit family BIOS Graphics processing unit Knoppix Computer virus Atari ST Architecture of Windows 2000 PlayStation Portable Mac OS X Amiga USB flash drive Computer forensics Server Virtual memory Counter-Strike CPU cache Power Macintosh G3 Sega Dreamcast Computer System 7 (Macintosh) Nintendo GameCube MDAC Sound card Computer bus PlayStation 2 Xbox Kernel (computer science) TRS-80 Color Computer Embedded system TRS-80 Linux kernel Graphics card Device driver Common Unix Printing System Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Computer security DOS Mouse (computing) File system Screenshot Apple Macintosh Patch (computing) Motherboard ITunes Ethernet CPU design Apple Computer Visual Basic Digital rights management Amstrad CPC Modem Database Java programming language Commodore 128 PlayStation 3 Nintendo Microprocessor Windows registry NX bit Windows Me OpenBSD History of operating systems Computer software Anti-virus software

when i play games on my hp compac prosareo it shuts off games put additional demands on graphics cards and cause them to produce more heat you may want to see if your video card if separate has a fan on it and if it's working if it has a fan but it isn't running that's more likely your problem a lot of these computer packaged systems like compaq hp acer etc have their graphics chips integrated onto the motherboard this means they don't have separate graphics cards these systems have the worst graphics performance anyway so if you have one of these you may want to buy a graphics card you will probably need to disable the built in graphics by changing a setting in your bios which you usually access while booting the system and pressing a key often the delete key or one of the function keys  IBM PC compatible Amiga BIOS TRS-80 PC Engine Commodore 128 Graphics card Commodore 64 Personal computer ATI Technologies Nintendo Entertainment System Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Atari ST ZX Spectrum NVIDIA Windows 2000 IBM PC Apple IIGS AMD Mouse (computing) Graphics processing unit Computer Windows Vista History of operating systems Computer bus PlayStation 2 USB flash drive Timeline of computing 1990-forward Cyrix 3dfx Laptop PC motherboard TRS-80 Color Computer MAME Knoppix Overclocking Windows 3.x Hard disk Universal Serial Bus Modchip Linux Microprocessor History of Microsoft Windows Commodore International Radeon Apple Macintosh Color Graphics Adapter Wintel Beatmania IIDX Fritz-chip PlayStation Portable S3 Graphics Sega Dreamcast MIPS architecture Amstrad CPC Mac OS X History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Original Amiga chipset Advanced Technology Attachment Emacs Java programming language Power-On Self Test Microsoft Windows Kernel (computer science) The Sims 2 Central processing unit Nintendo Dynamic random access memory Sprite (computer graphics) MSX Acorn Electron Nintendo Revolution Final Fantasy (video game) Motherboard System/36 Yu-Gi-Oh!

will vista transformation pack have any problems with windows xp professional with pentium processor im afraid of using vista transformation pack because ive seen success stories and unsuccesful stories i have used the vista transformation pack initially it worked fine but after a week or so the so called vista lookalike software started freezing i thought it was a virus so scanned and found nothing then i thought there might be something wrong with one of my hardware but again nothing initially it would freeze once or twice in a day but as the days when on it got worst i believe that the software has some holes which causes it to become unstable would recommend not to install it  Windows XP Windows Vista Microsoft Windows Computer virus History of Microsoft Windows Software bug IBM PC compatible OpenGL NX bit Xbox Windows 2000 World of Warcraft X86 Windows Server 2003 Blue screen of death Apple Macintosh Anti-virus software Microsoft Spyware Sea ice Pentium 4 AMD64 CPU cache Patch (computing) Booting History of the graphical user interface IA-32 64-bit Timeline of computing 1990-forward IMac IPod Mac OS X Linux Software cracking Next-Generation Secure Computing Base OS/2 Mandriva Linux Unicode Microsoft Office Novell NetWare PlayStation 2 X86 assembly language Copy protection Digital Equipment Corporation Browser wars TRS-80 Fritz-chip Common criticisms of Microsoft Windows XP Media Center Edition IA-64 RISC Mach kernel Game programming Operating system AMD Oscilloscope Debugging Digital signal processing Atari ST OpenBSD Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Google Desktop Chula Vista, California Microprocessor Pentium III Apple Computer ZX Spectrum Ebook XML WindowBlinds USB flash drive Portable Document Format Self-modifying code Megatron ALGOL 68 Sun Microsystems Wintel Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Outlook Express Warez Virtual memory Modem DragonFly BSD Nintendo Entertainment System Software engineering X Window System Mouse (computing) Buffer overflow Mac OS AmigaOS Internet Explorer Amiga Thread (computer science) Steam (content delivery) CPU design NVIDIA Apple IIGS WordPerfect Master Control Program

can you diagnose my computer problem i have an ibm aptiva computer from upon startup there is a black screen with a flashing horizontal cursor in the upper left corner keyboard and mouse input are not registered nothing else happens the cursor just flashes it's been like this for awhile and i vaguely remember trying to use a recovery disk is there any hope of recovering stored files thanks in advance it sounds like the bios battery is empty or the bios motherboard is faulty this is most certainly the case if it hasn't got past the post power on self test where it beeps on startup i would say it is the bios battery since you bought it over a decade ago the battery can be replaced although on the old aptiva's you may need to set some jumpers on the motherboard to reset the bios afterwards first step though is to change that battery it should be a cr if in doubt take it out and look on the battery yes you can recover your files and stuff as they are all on your hardrive and that can simply be installed into another or new computer check the link below of what the battery looks like  Hard disk BIOS Commodore 64 Mouse (computing) Personal computer Redundant array of independent disks IBM PC compatible Atari ST Power-On Self Test Booting Blue screen of death Screenshot Oscilloscope IBM PC USB flash drive Commodore 128 Atari 8-bit family Laptop Modchip Amiga System/36 ZX Spectrum IPod Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Windows XP Sega Saturn Commodore PET Embedded system Password Apple Macintosh Floppy disk System/34 Apple IIGS File Allocation Table Advanced Technology Attachment Desktop computer MSX Read-only memory Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Computer forensics Non-volatile memory Apple Computer Digital photography File system PlayStation Portable Debugging Nonvolatile BIOS memory PC motherboard Opera (web browser) Computer Slide rule TRS-80 Color Computer Linux Dance Dance Revolution Windows 3.x WordStar ThinkPad Mozilla Firefox Kaypro Windows registry Capacitor plague IMac Macromedia Flash IBM Server X Window System Extensible Firmware Interface Central processing unit A4000 MBASIC IBM Personal System/2 Control Panel (Windows) Software testing Unicode HTML element Touchscreen Database Cheating in Counter-Strike Knoppix Battery (electricity) NaturallySpeaking Data remanence Computer bus Patch (computing) Wintel MAME History of the graphical user interface DVD Flash memory

help with cpu virtual memory i cannot access web pages although my internet connection is good i get an error saying my virtual memory is low i run windows xp on a dell ' help would be appreciated here is what happening when you have a warning sign showing virtual memory is low warning your computer uses physical memory aka ram and virtual memory virtual memory is used to simulate more ram when your computer is reaching its maximum cpu and ram usage it very similar to a bucket filling up with water if your cpu needs water you can bring this resources to it but your bucket size is limited the more programs you use and disk space the more water is needed but you can only deliver the set amount of water because your bucket size is limited the bucket is your ram however you can use a spare bucket to quickly to help meet the demand the virtual memory is that spare bucket you can change your virtual memory by altering amount of free resources for your computer to use for it in a sense making the spare bucket bigger virtual memory uses free space as a resource so you can change the the amount free space reserved for the virtual memory when you get to the virtual memory menu select the custom size check box then choose the initial size and the max size depending on how much free space you have you can choose what that amount of free space you want if you are still confused the link below has a visual step by step instructions click start and then click control panel click performance and maintenance and then click system on the advanced tab under performance click settings under virtual memory click change under drive volume label click the drive that contains the paging file that you want to change in most computers its c under paging file size for selected drive click to custom size check box you can enter the amount of memory you would like to reserve for virtual memory by entering the initial and maximum size click set hot tip keep the initial and maximum size the same to cut down on your cpu access this will stop your cpu from constantly change your virtual memory paging size also set the size times higher than your physical memory hope this helps http www delete computer history com increase virtual memory html  Windows 2000 Windows XP Redundant array of independent disks Central processing unit RISC Embedded system CPU design Computer Atari 8-bit family Gmail File Allocation Table Mouse (computing) Mach kernel IBM PC compatible Linux Macromedia Flash Emacs MIPS architecture Apollo Guidance Computer Web crawler Floppy disk Hard disk PaX Computer virus Windows Vista IA-32 Apple Macintosh AmigaOS Windows 3.x Microsoft Windows Computer multitasking NX bit Compiler optimization Domain Name System Motorola 68000 USB flash drive Computer bus Opera (web browser) Object Desktop Java programming language Super Nintendo Entertainment System Unicode PlayStation Portable Mozilla Firefox Page table C programming language History of Microsoft Windows System/36 INMOS Transputer Original Amiga chipset Commodore 64 Spyware Emulator Data General Nova Memory (computers) Advanced Technology Attachment PDP-11 Microprogram CDC 6600 ITunes ZX Spectrum Hash table Booting System/34 Atari ST Forth programming language Xbox 360 NeXT System 7 (Macintosh) Cache Expert system X86 Visual Basic Library (computer science) 64-bit Btrieve Mainframe computer Sorting algorithm Digital photography Common Unix Printing System Acorn Electron Kernel (computer science) Apple IIGS Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Quantum computer NTFS Screenshot Mac OS X PlayStation 3

my computer is relatively new but for some reason it sounds really loud i think its the fan thats really loud do you have any suggestions to what i can do or try fans can spin out the lubricant could be either the cpu cooler fan or the power supply fan if the computer is still under warranty contact the manufacturer eventually the fan s can stop spinning when that happens the computer will quickly overheat if it's the cpu cooler you will get overheating error messages if it's the power supply the ps will just die and you won't be able to power it up anymore been there done that seen both happen replacement power supply replacement cpu cooler  Overclocking Commodore 64 Central processing unit Personal computer Capacitor plague Turbocharger Motorcycle CPU cooling Atari ST RISC Laptop Atari 8-bit family Desktop computer PowerPC Computer Watercooling Aluminium Model aircraft ZX Spectrum Hard disk M16 (rifle) Cyrix CPU cache Radiation hardening E85 SGI Indy CPU design Atari 2600 Computer cooling Acorn Computers Amiga IBM PC compatible Pinball Commodore 128 Manual transmission Electric motor Sega Dreamcast Blue screen of death Nintendo Entertainment System Warranty Thermal power station MOS Technology 6502 Cray-1 Computer bus Sound card The Price Is Right Pearl Jam Domestic AC power plugs and sockets MOS Technology Engine cooling VIA C3 Hyperthermia Mars Exploration Rover IMac Toyota Prius Embedded system Heat sink X86 Booting Cheating in Counter-Strike Fan (implement) SAM Coup__ Altair 8800 Galileo spacecraft Athlon Sega Saturn Ethernet Commodore 1541 Intellivision Computer multitasking IPod Dual-core MIPS architecture Apple Computer Apple Macintosh Disc brake PC motherboard Emulator KIM-1 Windows 3.x Power Mac G5 Wind power Zilog Z80 Clock rate Cache Motor oil Power-On Self Test Fermi paradox Computer workstation Digital Armored Core Computer case Commodore Plus/4 John Sheridan (Babylon 5) PDP-11 Disc jockey Home computer PlayStation Portable Motorola 68000

what is better amd or intel pentinum i have amd amd or intel pentinum what's better is open to interpretation since i'm writing to you on a notebook that has an amd processor and cost me less than it was selling for at walmart and even more savings over buying an equivelent intel system i feel that in my case amd was the better choice for me i've built many systems in the past and after discussing cost vs speed with the persons or businesses i was building for more often amd was chosen over intel just for it's lower cost even though it's minutely slower than intel intel chips are and have historically been more expensive and slightly faster even when compairing the top of the line chip to the top of the line amd chip the speed differences in chips are barely noticable however the two companies continue to wage war against one another for the top spot in pc chip manufacturer it seems that whenever amd bests intel intel responds with a faster cpu and amd follows it's an ever changing game years ago there was the rumor that amd cpu's were unstable compared to intel chips i've never seen any proof of this and i've built many amd systems what's better the one you have and works wether its' amd or intel i hope you found this usefull marcos  CPU cache AMD Cyrix Central processing unit IBM PC compatible RISC Microprocessor Computer workstation CPU design Athlon Intel Overclocking AMD K6-2 VIA Technologies Opteron Apple Intel transition AMD 5x86 IA-32 NVIDIA Wintel AMD K6-III PR rating Am386 Sun Microsystems Apple Macintosh Transmeta MIPS architecture Moore's law Timeline of computing 1990-forward Clock rate Laptop Integrated circuit X86 Dual-core VIA C3 AMD64 NeXT Pentium III Intel 80386 AMD K6 MOS Technology 6502 64-bit Athlon 64 GeForce 6 Series Front side bus Computer Benchmark (computing) 3dfx MOS Technology X86 assembly language HyperTransport Pentium M AMD K5 Pentium History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Personal computer DDR2 SDRAM Symmetric multiprocessing Intel 80486 PlayStation 3 IBM PC Atari 8-bit family Embedded system Motorola 68000 AltiVec IA-64 NX bit Redundant array of independent disks Commodore 128 Northbridge (computing) Zilog Z80 Athlon 64 X2 Digital Equipment Corporation Windows XP Acorn Computers Radeon DEC Alpha Coprocessor Buffer overflow Nintendo Revolution Commodore 64 IMac Duron ATI Technologies Tandem Computers Intel iAPX 432 Microsoft Windows Microcontroller Linux
