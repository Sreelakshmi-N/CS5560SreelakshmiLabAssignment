vegetarian i have decided to become a vegetarian i have been for about months now but my parents are completely against it what should i do ultimately you control what goes into your body if they're against it that's their problem not yours here are a few good arguments though if they're giving you cheek about it vegetables are capable of providing all the same nutrients as meat protein from beans iron from spinach and other leafy greens and even avocados have fat in them and yes your body does need a certain amount of fat to function correctly a vegetarian diet is more humane and environmentally sustainable who's ever heard of mad corn disease seed and leaf disease exactly nobody vegetables are easy to prepare and easy to work into the family diet after all weren't your parents the ones that didn't give you dessert until you ate your peas i really don't see how someone could be against it but like i said it's your body even they can't argue with that fact  Vegetarianism Veganism Food Dieting Vegetarian nutrition Atkins Nutritional Approach Organic food Omega-3 fatty acid Vegetarian cuisine Tocopherol Avocado Hamster Soybean Nutrition Raw food diet Environmental vegetarianism Nutrient Vitamin C Coronary heart disease Healthy eating Guinea pig Fruitarianism Low-carbohydrate diet Folic acid Potassium Egg (food) Brain Agriculture Protein Prostate cancer Breastfeeding Japanese cuisine Cuisine of Singapore Cuisine of Brazil Gelatin Bengali cuisine Cheese Coeliac disease Chinese cuisine Hot dog Cuisine of Africa Chili con carne MRE Cuisine of the Philippines Organic farming Soul food Domestic rabbit Milk Food guide pyramid Cuisine of Denmark Acorn German cuisine Common bean Peruvian cuisine Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Russian cuisine Spinach Crohn's disease Food preservation Trans fat Maize Anemia Cat Vegetarianism and religion Pea Fancy rat Ramen Tomato Ferret Liver Fecal incontinence Kashrut Dog Zinc Cantonese cuisine Malnutrition Fasting Vitamin British cuisine Famine Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Overpopulation Dim sum Insulin Pea soup Flowering plant Genetically modified food Antioxidant Neolithic Revolution Jewish cuisine Domesticated turkey Cereal Green Revolution Hamburger French cuisine

do guys like vegan girls do typical guys think vegan girls are weird or do they think theyre cool because theyre dedicated to generalize boys isn't a good basis guys like different things some guys like blondes other like brunettes some like thin girls and others like a girl with some meat on her it depends on the guy i'd say a lot of the guys that try to prove they are macho wouldn't give a vegan girl the time of day much like the first poster on here guys that are secure with themselves probably would be more open to a vegan girl my boyfriend is a meat eater but he supports my decision and even tests a lot of the food i make and really enjoys it but before i met him i would have guys come up and hit on me and as soon as they heard me order food that didn't contain meat in it they immediately started making jokes and insulting me i guess you can say it depends on their maturity level if anything  Veganism The Ashlee Simpson Show Blood on the Tracks Friends Avenue Q Kodocha Teen Girl Squad Blonde on Blonde Reservoir Dogs About a Boy Little Britain Totally Spies!

i want to be a vegetarian but how and why tell me the gross things of meat like people say that a hotdog has pigs azz in it tell me those kinds of things that would make me gross out of eating meat and making me a vegitarian what can i eat if im a vegitarian i would also like some links to websites thank you this is what i watched the night that i gave up eating all animals and decided to work towards living without eating any animals products http meat org there have been vegan olympic gold medalists and a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential http en wikipedia org wiki carl lewis http www eatright org cps rde xchg ada hs xsl advocacy enu html draft htm if you want to become a lacto ovo vegetarian the transition should be quite simple almost all meats have widely available commercial replacements all that you have to do is replace any flesh in your diet beef pork poultry seafood with meat analogs or just leave it out altogether you should keep in mind that a journey such as this can be quite short but should just be the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this is because of the reality of factory farming in which animals that are kept alive to produce milk eggs etc suffer much more and longer than animals that are raised to a certain weight and then slaughtered http www veganoutreach org whyvegan http meat org some people use the word vegan in reference to this idea but be aware that applying that label to yourself should always come with the inclusion of wise activism and advocacy http www veganoutreach org advocacy index html two extremely important examples of this are that you should never speak to someone about vegetarianism veganism without their consent and genuine interest or as a comment on what they are eating and your dietary beliefs should never be used as an introduction or explanation of who you are as a person veg ism should be something that comes up after people get to know you and they offer you a situation that makes it confusing to withhold the information discussion also if you are presented something that you choose not to eat or you are ordering food eating together somewhere picking the best place to eat when you you hold off on the subject until it's necessary and then act like it isn't a big deal at all people are usually surprised and way more interested and curious than if you were to bring it up when someone's eating or just using it as a conversation starter a responsible vegan always studies the subject of their own health and how to keep their body completely provided for in every sense http www veganhealth org sh to neglect their body is to define a plant based diet as unhealthy and is the opposite of helping the animals just to clear things up the vegetarian vegan diet is not composed of salads vegetables fruit and fake meat fruits and vegetables are always important but they do not make up the largest portion of any healthy diet a balanced plant based diet includes grains breads pasta rice cereal legumes soy beans peas lentils fruit and vegetables http www pcrm org health veginfo vsk food groups html http www peta org accidentallyvegan http www veganoutreach org whyvegan eating html being vegan can be an art one whose challenge is to take things that involve the suffering of the innocent and change them into something free of cruelty a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential technically the term vegetarian does imply that you don't consume anything that comes from the body of an animal that requires killing it many ingredients such as gelatin and glycerin are found in many candies fig newtons and many of other foods as well as rennet found in many cheeses http www happycow net health animal ingredients html the best thing to remember is to take your time so that for example when you are comfortable not eating beef and pork you can then give up chicken when you are sure you can make the commitment permanently depending on your age or reliance on parents or regional options it may not be best to give yourself a label the important thing is to do your best to make progress and be committed to your compassion towards animals never put your focus onto what you or other people use to describe yourself if you meet someone that talks down to people for eating meat dairy etc or to you because they think they are more veg than you laugh in their face and tell them they are a disgrace to the entire philosophy people like this only hurt the idea of veg ism and the animals the point of all of this is to live compassionately and and as free from cruelty as you can all the while maintaining your health and a positive attitude people who don't maintain either need not open their mouths and represent our beliefs if you actually choose to read all of this i hope it helps if not feel free to e mail me if you have questions i'm vegan and these are some of my favorite things to eat breakfast bananas cream of wheat with brown sugar and soy butter cereal pancakes or french toast with real maple syrup vegan sausage patties smoothies lunch vegan sausage sandwiches sandwiches with vegan deli slices tofurkey is the only one that's kinda funky fruit dinner leftovers couscous salad vegan sushi potato or pasta salad dinner sloppy joes sausage and gravy with homemade biscuits spaghetti and trader joe's meatballs or tvp lasagna thai pad see ew pad khi mao drunkard's noodles pad prig king tofu eggplant with basil sauce yellow thai curry with tofu or vegan chikn and veggies and jasmine rice indian dal with homemade roti or dosai channa masala aloo gobi vegetable or minestrone soup pizza steamed pork buns with potstickers or spring rolls sweet sour orange lemon chikn vegan pho or wonton soup i use these sites to find recipes http www foodnetwork com http vegweb com http www recipezaar com

almost vegetarian people what is holding you back allison i think perhaps many should become vegans since the care of many cows is so horrendous however if the milk is from a good source and from happy loving cows i do not see anything wrong with it i have a wonderful cow who gives wonderful milk i will always drink raw milk from happy cows realmilk com toni montana i think this is the main reason perhaps people choosing to remain ignorant just like when hitler was taking over people turned a blind eye to all the terrible nazi camps and torture etc good thing they eventually woke up i havent eaten any meat except fish and only rarely for a year so i just need to go all the way and leave out the fish for a little while i was having trouble giving up fish but i've been reading about and thought about the environmental issues associated with fishing i had had trouble seeing them as feeling animals like cows and pigs but that wasnt fair  Veganism Dairy Livestock Kosher foods Animal rights Taboo food and drink Cattle Kashrut Milk Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tofu People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Cheese Fiddler on the Roof Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Peter Singer Lisa the Vegetarian Egg (food) 613 mitzvot Breastfeeding Dieting Environmental vegetarianism Cat Punk ideology Unclean animals Escherichia coli O157:H7 Hindu Philosophical skepticism Vegetarianism and religion Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Joke Animal Farm Poker jargon Buddhist cuisine Garfield Elephant Whaling Goodness and value theory Guinea pig Soy milk Gelatin The Shining (film) Dr. Seuss Vegetarian cuisine Theory of conduct Dairy cattle Ethical consumerism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Pitaten Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Salad Fingers Food Mickey Mouse Avenue Q Futurama (TV series - season 2) Animal Liberation Front Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Social rule French cuisine Chicken Cuisine of Africa Pysanka Cuisine of Singapore Vegetarian nutrition Ranma __ characters Kender Sin City Raw food diet Characters in the Smurfs Hera Meat Dairy farming Happiness Russian cuisine Korean cuisine Homer Simpson Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Whale Agriculture in Australia Nicomachean Ethics Animal husbandry Rent (musical) Mahatma Gandhi Jersey Second Battle of the Atlantic Cuisine of the Philippines The Human Stain Cuisine of Brazil Soybean Meat analogue Jam (TV series) The Holocaust Omega-3 fatty acid Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Death Gate Cycle Hathor

i'm going vegan can you help me with what to eat and stuff i don't really like soya products which i no isnt good if you're going vegan help would be much appreciated soy makes up a minuscule portion of the wide variety of vegan protein sources soy is the most common protein found in meat replacements but seitan a soy free protein source made from wheat can be very versatile and take on many flavors and textures when prepared at home then again if you aren't allergic to soy you may end up experimenting and find some very practical uses for some soy products there have been vegan olympic gold medalists and a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential http en wikipedia org wiki carl lewis http www eatright org cps rde xchg ada hs xsl advocacy enu html draft htm that is great that you want to become vegan my biggest word of advice is to study a balanced vegan diet and learn how to cook prepare everything that you will need to keep yourself satisfied before you start to label yourself as vegan this is important in keeping yourself healthy and working towards a fit body that can redefine vegan stereotypes your journey as vegetarian was just the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this should be due to the reality of factory farming in which animals that are kept alive to produce milk eggs etc suffer much more and longer than animals that are raised to a certain weight and then slaughtered http www veganoutreach org whyvegan http meat org some people use the word vegan in reference to this idea but be aware that applying that label to yourself should always come with the inclusion of wise activism and advocacy http www veganoutreach org advocacy index html two extremely important examples of this are that you should never speak to someone about vegetarianism veganism without their consent and genuine interest or as a comment on what they are eating and your dietary beliefs should never be used as an introduction or explanation of who you are as a person veg ism should be something that comes up after people get to know you and they offer you a situation that makes it confusing to withhold the information discussion also if you are presented something that you choose not to eat or you are ordering food eating together somewhere picking the best place to eat a responsible vegan always studies the subject of their own health and how to keep their body completely provided for in every sense http www veganhealth org sh to neglect their body is to define a plant based diet as unhealthy and is the opposite of helping the animals when you you hold off on the subject until it's necessary and then act like it isn't a big deal at all people are usually surprised and way more interested and curious than if you were to bring it up when someone's eating or just using it as a conversation starter a balanced plant based diet includes grains breads pasta rice cereal legumes soy beans peas lentils fruit and vegetables http www pcrm org health veginfo vsk food groups html http www peta org accidentallyvegan http www veganoutreach org whyvegan eating html being vegan can be an art one whose challenge is to take things that involve the suffering of the innocent and change them into something free of cruelty a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential technically the term vegetarian does imply that you don't consume anything that comes from the body of an animal that requires killing it many ingredients such as gelatin and glycerin are found in many candies fig newtons and many of other foods as well as rennet found in many cheeses http www happycow net health animal ingredients html the best thing to remember is to take your time so that for example when you are comfortable not eating whey and casein you can then give up sodium stearoyl lactylate and l cysteine when you are sure you can make the commitment permanently depending on your age or reliance on parents or regional options it may not be best to give yourself a label the important thing is to do your best to make progress and be committed to your compassion towards animals never put your focus onto what you or other people use to describe yourself if you meet someone that talks down to people for eating meat dairy etc or to you because they think they are more veg than you laugh in their face and tell them they are a disgrace to the entire philosophy people like this only hurt the idea of veg ism and the animals the point of all of this is to live compassionately and and as free from cruelty as you can all the while maintaining your health and a positive attitude people who don't maintain either need not open their mouths and represent our beliefs if you actually choose to read all of this i hope it helps if not feel free to e mail me if you have questions i'm vegan and these are some of my favorite things to eat breakfast bananas cream of wheat with brown sugar and soy butter cereal pancakes or french toast with real maple syrup vegan sausage patties smoothies lunch vegan sausage sandwiches sandwiches with vegan deli slices tofurkey is the only one that's kinda funky fruit dinner leftovers couscous salad vegan sushi potato or pasta salad dinner sloppy joes sausage and gravy with homemade biscuits spaghetti and trader joe's meatballs or tvp lasagna thai pad see ew pad khi mao drunkard's noodles pad prig king tofu eggplant with basil sauce yellow thai curry with tofu or vegan chikn and veggies and jasmine rice indian dal with homemade roti or dosai channa masala aloo gobi vegetable or minestrone soup pizza steamed pork buns with potstickers or spring rolls sweet sour orange lemon chikn

what not to eat ok im a vegetarian and just fount out about mic donalds french fries i am soo sad because i ate them the day before well i was just wondering if there were any other foods and aren't vegetarian and i already know meat plz i need good answers i know not to eat meat for the second time and i mean in general like don't eat mc donalds fries or some canned beans and all and what brands are ok mcdonald's fries are just going to make you sick and unhealthy anyway it is up to you if you want to eat fries somewhere else fast food places heat the same oil for weeks sometimes and cancer causing chemicals begin to form within a couple hours after reaching deep frying temperatures if you really need them learn how to make your own it's still bad for you but nowhere close to fries from a chain technically the term vegetarian does imply that you don't consume anything that comes from the body of an animal that requires killing it many ingredients such as gelatin and glycerin are found in many candies fig newtons and many of other foods as well as rennet found in many cheeses http www happycow net health animal ingredients html the best thing to remember is to take your time so that for example when you are comfortable not eating beef and pork you can then give up chicken when you are sure you can make the commitment permanently depending on your age or reliance on parents or regional options it may not be best to give yourself a label the important thing is to do your best to make progress and be committed to your compassion towards animals never put your focus onto what you or other people use to describe yourself you should keep in mind that a journey such as this can be quite short but should just be the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this is because of the reality of factory farming in which animals that are kept alive to produce milk eggs etc suffer much more and longer than animals that are raised to a certain weight and then slaughtered http www veganoutreach org whyvegan http meat org some people use the word vegan in reference to this idea but be aware that applying that label to yourself should always come with the inclusion of wise activism and advocacy http www veganoutreach org advocacy index html two extremely important examples of this are that you should never speak to someone about vegetarianism veganism without their consent and genuine interest or as a comment on what they are eating and your dietary beliefs should never be used as an introduction or explanation of who you are as a person veg ism should be something that comes up after people get to know you and they offer you a situation that makes it confusing to withhold the information discussion also if you are presented something that you choose not to eat or you are ordering food eating together somewhere picking the best place to eat a responsible vegan always studies the subject of their own health and how to keep their body completely provided for in every sense http www veganhealth org sh to neglect their body is to define a plant based diet as unhealthy and is the opposite of helping the animals when you you hold off on the subject until it's necessary and then act like it isn't a big deal at all people are usually surprised and way more interested and curious than if you were to bring it up when someone's eating or just using it as a conversation starter just to clear things up the vegetarian vegan diet is not composed of salads vegetables fruit and fake meat fruits and vegetables are always important but they do not make up the largest portion of any healthy diet a balanced plant based diet includes grains breads pasta rice cereal legumes soy beans peas lentils fruit and vegetables http www pcrm org health veginfo vsk food groups html http www peta org accidentallyvegan http www veganoutreach org whyvegan eating html being vegan can be an art one whose challenge is to take things that involve the suffering of the innocent and change them into something free of cruelty a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential if you meet someone that talks down to people for eating meat dairy etc or to you because they think they are more veg than you laugh in their face and tell them they are a disgrace to the entire philosophy people like this only hurt the idea of veg ism and the animals the point of all of this is to live compassionately and and as free from cruelty as you can all the while maintaining your health and a positive

can you give an advice about a vegetarian diet what kind of meals must i eat to be strong enough there have been vegan olympic gold medalists and vegan mothers that grow healthy human beings inside their bodies that stay vegan their entire life and stay healthy http en wikipedia org wiki carl lewis http www eatright org cps rde xchg ada hs xsl advocacy enu html draft htm if you want to increase muscle mass it is recommended to eat to grams of protein per pound of lean body weight the advantage is that vegetarians can get limitless protein with a fraction of the fat and extra calories of animal flesh their is only a disadvantage in price if you rely heavily on mock fake meats for protein tvp and vital wheat gluten can have way more protein per weight than meat and the key is learning to use them in an appealing way tvp replaces ground beef in any recipe and gluten can be used in many forms if you want to become a lacto ovo vegetarian the transition should be quite simple almost all meats have widely available commercial replacements all that you have to do is replace any flesh in your diet beef pork poultry seafood with meat analogs or just leave it out altogether you should keep in mind that a journey such as this can be quite short but should just be the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this is because of the reality of factory

why vegan i have to say that i can understand being vegetarian for ethical reasons such as being against animal slaughter but i will be honest and say with respect that i don't really understand the vegan viewpoint milk eggs honey none of these things are products that hurt the animals i mean what's wrong with healthy food like yogurt and free range eggs and honey so why choose a path as tough as veganism why are you vegan would love to have some light shed on this interested in hearing answers well yes of course i understand in the case of lactose intolerance this question is for people who have reasons behind it other than medical ones some very good points no one has addressed honey or free range eggs yet though i am vegan because i don't think animals are on this earth to produce food for myself or any human they are sentient creatures that do not deserve to be treated as property most dairy cows and chickens must endure miserable lives and are killed once their production of milk and eggs are considered no longer as profitable their lives mean nothing more than the products they produce being vegan is not a tough path at all i wouldn't trade it for the world ok let me try honey bees are killed in the honey harvesting process but even more compelling for me is the fact that bees do not make honey for humans it does not belong to us the bees make that for themselves i haven't eaten honey in years and i am healthy as a horse free range eggs if you are buying these from the store and have never visited the farm who knows what conditions these chickens really live and you must deal with the fact that all the male chicks that are hatched are destroyed some chicks are hatched to replace the older hens if you know the farm or get the eggs from your own chicken i still have a problem with it since that egg doesn't belong to you you don't need to eat it so why take it plus the thought of eggs is just gross thanks for asking an intelligent thoughtful question we don't get alot of those around here  Dairy Livestock Theory of conduct Animal rights Chicken Egg (food) Factory farming Kosher foods Kashrut Agriculture Honeybee Food Organic food Lactose intolerance People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Vegetarianism and religion Peter Singer Cheese Alignment (role-playing games) Taboo food and drink Yoghurt Vegetarian cuisine Dairy product Chocolate Honey Goodness and value theory Dairy farming Ecology Dieting Dairy cattle David Hume Ethical consumerism Simone Weil Raw food diet Bird Guns, Germs, and Steel Omega-3 fatty acid Pizza Person Religion Utilitarianism Diseases of the honeybee Economics Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Bee Buddhist cuisine Buddhism Abortion debate Creationism Shark Hard-line The chicken or the egg Snake Microeconomics Tofu Crohn's disease Breastfeeding Cat Ethics Meaning of life Beehive (beekeeping) Paradox Scientology beliefs and practices Unclean animals Kodocha Sant Mat Determinism Pysanka Theodicy Causality Raw milk Ice cream Philosophical skepticism Insect Nicomachean Ethics Organic farming Punk ideology John Howard Yoder Intelligent design Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Animal Liberation Front Socrates 613 mitzvot Lisa the Vegetarian Famine Africanized bee Traditional Chinese medicine Human Escherichia coli O157:H7 Roman eating and drinking

i'm trying to become a vegitarian any tips the title says it all so far i have had no good awnsers and i am sorry that i missspelled but i am only and duh i know not to eat meat products thanks alot lindsey jane i want to pick you for best awnsers so unless anyone can beat her you get the points there is a lot to learn if you want to become vegetarian you should be proud to have a mind that is willing to do things differently from most people there have been vegan olympic gold medalists and a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential http en wikipedia org wiki carl lewis http www eatright org cps rde xchg ada hs xsl advocacy enu html draft htm there is a japanese analogy proverb that goes like this the nail that sticks up is the one that gets hammered down people are like this everywhere when you tell your family that it is your personal belief that animals should not be eaten they take a look at themselves and it can be subconsciously translated into what you do is wrong and i choose to be right your parents have probably been taught a huge amount of misinformation by their parents and their teachers while growing up you really need to research vegetarian diets and health before you even think about saying the v word in front of your parents when you have gathered enough information and feel confident in a vegetarian diet's ability to maintain or even improve health you may mention to them that you have made the decision they may be shocked angry worried curious or many other things but you must never react to their behavior and always stay calm if they are able to speak to you and respect your choice please tell them everything and answer all questions if they are rude inconsiderate judgmental violent or verbally abusive refuse to continue any conversation until they can speak to you with respect the best advice is to study everything that you can about a healthy vegetarian diet and keep yourself in good shape better than most people your age or than your friends family if possible if nobody that you know shows a genuine positive interest in your choice don't give them the privilege of the knowledge that you have gathered work your way around any attempts they make to trivialize your beliefs and if possible go shopping with your parents and buy things that aren't obvious veggie fare instead of trying to sneak fake meat into the cart toss in lentil soup peanut butter pasta fruits veggies or anything else that you have learned is needed to fill any gaps in your diet if you want to become a lacto ovo vegetarian the transition should be quite simple almost all meats have widely available commercial replacements all that you have to do is replace any flesh in your diet beef pork poultry seafood with meat analogs or just leave it out altogether you should keep in mind that a journey such as this can be quite short but should just be the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this is because of the reality of factory farming in which animals that are kept alive to produce milk eggs etc suffer much more and longer than animals that are raised to a certain weight and then slaughtered http www veganoutreach org whyvegan http meat org some people use the word vegan in reference to this idea but be aware that applying that label to yourself should always come with the inclusion of wise activism and advocacy http www veganoutreach org advocacy index html two extremely important examples of this are that you should never speak to someone about vegetarianism veganism without their consent and genuine interest or as a comment on what they are eating and your dietary beliefs should never be used as an introduction or explanation of who you are as a person veg ism should be something that comes up after people get to know you and they offer you a situation that makes it confusing to withhold the information discussion also if you are presented something that you choose not to eat or you are ordering food eating together somewhere picking the best place to eat when you you hold off on the subject until it's necessary and then act like it isn't a big deal at all people are usually surprised and way more interested and curious than if you were to bring it up when someone's eating or just using it as a conversation starter a responsible vegan always studies the subject of their own health and how to keep their body completely provided for in every sense http www veganhealth org sh to neglect their body is to define a plant based diet as unhealthy and is the opposite of helping the animals just to clear things up the vegetarian vegan diet is not composed of salads vegetables fruit and fake meat fruits and vegetables are always important but they do not make up the largest portion of any healthy diet a balanced plant based diet includes grains breads pasta rice cereal legumes soy beans peas lentils fruit and vegetables http www pcrm org health veginfo vsk food groups html http www peta org accidentallyvegan http www veganoutreach org whyvegan eating html being vegan can be an art one whose challenge is to take things that involve the suffering of the innocent and change them into something free of cruelty a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential technically the term vegetarian does imply that you don't consume anything that comes from the body of an animal that requires killing it many ingredients such as gelatin and glycerin are found in many candies fig newtons and many of other foods as well as rennet found in many cheeses http www happycow net health animal ingredients html the best thing to remember is to take your time so that for example when you are comfortable not eating beef and pork you can then give up chicken when you are sure you can make the commitment permanently depending on your age or reliance on parents or regional options it may not be best to give yourself a label the important thing is to do your best to make progress and be committed to your compassion towards animals never put your focus onto what you or other people use to describe yourself if you meet someone that talks down to people for eating meat dairy etc or to you because they think they are more veg than you laugh in their face and tell them they are a disgrace to the entire philosophy people like this only hurt the idea of veg ism and the animals the point of all of this is to live compassionately and and as free from cruelty as you can all the while maintaining your health and a positive attitude people who don't maintain either need not open their mouths and represent our beliefs if you actually choose to read all of this i hope it helps if not feel free to e mail me if you have questions i'm vegan and these are some of my favorite things to eat breakfast bananas cream of wheat with brown sugar and soy butter

i just started being vegan but can i still eat bread well i did research it but i never fully got a real answer it has eggs and milk commercial breads usually have whey honey sodium stearoyl lactylate

vegans nothing derived from animals do vegans believe in breast feeding or do they usually not have children some people are vegans because they are against the cruelty of the dairy and egg industries and some because they view drinking another species' milk as unnatural cow's milk is for their calves and so forth others follow a vegan diet for health reasons breastfeeding is not in conflict with any of these it is consensual non harmful to mother or child and human milk is nutritionally best for human babies thus vegans tend to heavily encourage breastfeeding human breast milk is technically an animal product just as fingernails and blood are for example but vegans are no more anti breastfeeding than they are anti fingernail biting or anti blood transfusions and to think otherwise is seriously misunderstanding our philosophy  Breastfeeding Vegetarianism Milk Dairy Kashrut Animal rights Infant formula Taboo food and drink Breast milk Factory farming Vitamin D Elephant Raw food diet Kosher foods Breast Egg (food) Soy milk Soybean Infant Livestock Childbirth Dairy cattle Cheese Vegetarian nutrition Cattle Dieting People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Chocolate Raw milk Dairy farming Food Dairy product Mastitis HIV Nutrition Tofu Chicken Nestl__ International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Paleolithic diet Nestl__ boycott Nipple Omega-3 fatty acid Person Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Sacred cow Atkins Nutritional Approach Animal husbandry Breast pump Cat Cytomegalovirus Animal Liberation Front Cyanocobalamin Hard-line Rickets Vegetarianism and religion Food allergy Guinea pig Vitamin C Vampire Protein-energy malnutrition Pet skunk Environmental vegetarianism Vegetarian cuisine Hypoglycemia Brain Food and Drug Administration Prolactin Mosquito West Nile virus Whale Tom Regan Jaundice Traditional Chinese medicine Tooth Domestic goat Cadbury Schweppes Genetically modified food Fertility awareness Pasteurization Horse Teat Docosahexaenoic acid Meat analogue Organic food Platypus Zoophilia Yoghurt Prolactinoma Dog Crohn's disease Escherichia coli O157:H7 Kangaroo Organic farming Natural Hygiene Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder

can becoming a vegan or a vegetarian improve your health it can be very easy to improve your health with a vegetarian diet this will never happen if you do things like replace meat with junk food or become vegan and don't educate yourself on what whole plant foods can provide all of the nutrients that animal products are commonly showered with praise for containing there have been vegan olympic gold medalists and a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential http en wikipedia org wiki carl lewis http www eatright org cps rde xchg ada hs xsl advocacy enu html draft htm if you want to become a lacto ovo vegetarian the transition should be quite simple almost all meats have widely available commercial replacements all that you have to do is replace any flesh in your diet beef pork poultry seafood with meat analogs or just leave it out altogether you should keep in mind that a journey such as this can be quite short but should just be the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this is because of the reality of factory farming in which animals that are kept alive to produce milk eggs etc suffer much more and longer than animals that are raised to a certain weight and then slaughtered http www veganoutreach org whyvegan http meat org some people use the word vegan in reference to this idea but be aware that applying that label to yourself should always come with the inclusion of wise activism and advocacy http www veganoutreach org advocacy index html two extremely important examples of this are that you should never speak to someone about vegetarianism veganism without their consent and genuine interest or as a comment on what they are eating and your dietary beliefs should never be used as an introduction or explanation of who you are as a person veg ism should be something that comes up after people get to know you and they offer you a situation that makes it confusing to withhold the information discussion also if you are presented something that you choose not to eat or you are ordering food eating together somewhere picking the best place to eat when you you hold off on the subject until it's necessary and then act like it isn't a big deal at all people are usually surprised and way more interested and curious than if you were to bring it up when someone's eating or just using it as a conversation starter a responsible vegan always studies the subject of their own health and how to keep their body completely provided for in every sense http www veganhealth org sh to neglect their body is to define a plant based diet as unhealthy and is the opposite of helping the animals just to clear things up the vegetarian vegan diet is not composed of salads vegetables fruit and fake meat fruits and vegetables are always important but they do not make up the largest portion of any healthy diet a balanced plant based diet includes grains breads pasta rice cereal legumes soy beans peas lentils fruit and vegetables http www pcrm org health veginfo vsk food groups html http www peta org accidentallyvegan http www veganoutreach org whyvegan eating html being vegan can be an art one whose challenge is to take things that involve the suffering of the innocent and change them into something free of cruelty a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential technically the term vegetarian does imply that you don't consume anything that comes from the body of an animal that requires killing it many ingredients such as gelatin and glycerin are found in many candies fig newtons and many of other foods as well as rennet found in many cheeses http www happycow net health animal ingredients html the best thing to remember is to take your time so that for example when you are comfortable not eating beef and pork you can then give up chicken when you are sure you can make the commitment permanently depending on your age or reliance on parents or regional options it may not be best to give yourself a label the important thing is to do your best to make progress and be committed to your compassion towards animals never put your focus onto what you or other people use to describe yourself if you meet someone that talks down to people for eating meat dairy etc or to you because they think they are more veg than you laugh in their face and tell them they are a disgrace to the entire philosophy people like this only hurt the idea of veg ism and the animals the point of all of this is to live compassionately and and as free from cruelty as you can all the while maintaining your health and a positive attitude people who don't maintain either need not open their mouths and represent our beliefs if you actually choose to read all of this i hope it helps if not feel free to e mail me if you have questions i'm vegan and these are some of my favorite things to eat breakfast bananas cream of wheat with brown sugar and soy butter cereal pancakes or french toast with real maple syrup vegan sausage patties smoothies snack brussel sprouts no joke lunch vegan sausage sandwiches sandwiches with vegan deli slices tofurkey is the only one that's kinda funky fruit dinner leftovers couscous salad vegan sushi potato or pasta salad dinner sloppy joes sausage and gravy with homemade biscuits spaghetti and trader joe's meatballs or tvp lasagna thai pad see ew pad khi mao drunkard's noodles pad prig king tofu eggplant with basil sauce yellow thai curry with tofu or vegan chikn and veggies and jasmine

using organic apple cider vinegar as a salad dressing studies say u shouldnt eat fruits veg gether i was just wondering if it would still b ok because apple cider is very alkaline but i know apples have a lot of sugar which is one of the reasons veggies and fruits dont digest well together thanks no don't mix fruit with anything they should be eaten alone i do believe that apple cider is not alkaline but the opposite acidic all vinegar is acidic once fermented as such the apple goes from alkaline to acidic i've never thought of it too much as i don't use vinegar often but i would guess that it's not a good combination i make vinegar and oil dressing once in a while but notice no ill effect as it's on rare occasions i would guess that it would cause gas if use often good question you'd have to look at how an acid like vinegar apple cider has other acids than white vinegar which just has one acid reacts with an oil then how they both react together in your gut something like lemon juice mixed with olive oil would solidify the oil in your gut i'd expect something similar to happen with vinegar  Vinegar Apple Fish and chips Acetic acid Cider Beer Fermentation Mayonnaise Breakfast Wine Cuisine of Denmark Jewish cuisine Apple pie German cuisine Peruvian cuisine Salad Olive oil Yoghurt Citric acid Mango French cuisine Sulfuric acid Ammonia Fanta Pickling Balsamic vinegar Hot sauce Cheese Dandruff Sushi Lemon Omega-3 fatty acid Cuisine of the Philippines Culinary mustard Hydrochloric acid Mead Japanese cuisine Tooth Food science Hypoglycemia Hair conditioner Rum Veganism Country wine Sauerkraut Soy protein Botulism Barbecue Sugar Nutrition Soil pH Tomato Diarrhea Cuisine of Austria Ester Cuisine of Africa Enzyme Alkane Russian cuisine Olive Carboxylic acid Aspartame Carbon dioxide Bread Tofu Malus Brandy Food Champagne (beverage) Tooth enamel Cuisine of Argentina Green Sauce Hydrogen sulfide Jam Date Palm Fish sauce Acid rain Hydrogen Raw food diet Egg (food) Invisible ink Sugarcane Toffee Butyric acid Cashew Crohn's disease Chile pepper Oily fish Biochemistry Milk Hydrogen peroxide Chutney Sewage treatment Water (molecule)

vegetarianism and ibs i was veg for two years a long time ago but i've recently been diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome as a result of my anxiety disorder and the antidepressants i'm on stopping those is not an option nor will it help my stomach much lactose and i are not friends i can handle probiotic yoghurts and small amounts of cheese as well as milk in small amounts if my stomach has not been acting up and if i take several lactaid pills soy and i are not friends at all i don't know for sure but i believe i am allergic to it i get incredible gas and cramps from even the smallest amount of soy milk or tofu other legumes are mostly ok as are most beans i still have to watch it though i am interested in cutting back on the amount of meat i eat unfortunately because of my condition it seems i have very few options help me please is this feasible is there a healthy way to do this i already said the ibs was caused by my anxiety and the meds i take i'm on pantoloc to help with excess acid in my stomach and i went off of the effexor which was so harsh on my stomach i refused to eat anything except breads because anything else hurt too much i have talked to my doctor about this and unfortunately there's not much she can do except help to control my anxiety which triggers the ibs tofu soy so no tofu is not really an option for me either the wheat based diet sounds more do able for me i have no problems with breads and glutens thank goodness i'd hate to say this but it sounds like your doctor isn't a very good one if he is letting these problems occure and not considering changing your doseage or your prescription you may want to consider a new one i have heard so many stories from doctors about what causes ibs and most are generic answers to cover up the fact that they do not know as for a vegetarian diet that can help i'm sure a well planned out diet can help but keep in mind that vegetarian diets are higher in antioxidants and your body will go through a detox process meat can stick to the inside lining of the digestive tract and prevent the linning from absorbing all the nutrients it can an needs once you pass the detox process you can start on a high fiber diet which is normally recommended by your doctor if you are diagnosed with ibs a good meat alternative that i recently tried for the first time is seitan it is not made of soy or milk but wheat gluten almond and rice milk are good alternatives and so are beans however you have to find out what kind of beans you like  Irritable bowel syndrome Soy milk Food Milk Vegetarian nutrition Nutrition Breastfeeding Folic acid Dietary fiber Chronic fatigue syndrome Meat analogue Lactose intolerance Omega-3 fatty acid Food allergy Vegetarian cuisine Cheese Bread Diarrhea Stomach cancer Prostate cancer Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Fecal incontinence Cancer Hamburger Urinary incontinence Gluten Tocopherol Antidepressant Atkins Nutritional Approach Coffee Protein Obesity Guinea pig Flatulence Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Multiple chemical sensitivity Cat Flour Autism Rice Adjustable gastric band Raw food diet Egg (food) Dairy Buddhist cuisine Gastroparesis Tooth Breakfast Tobacco smoking Anemia Bipolar disorder Post-traumatic stress disorder Autism epidemic Colorectal cancer Domestic rabbit Vitamin C Jewish cuisine Migraine Multiple sclerosis Kashrut Healthy eating Addiction Vitamin D Vomiting Foodborne illness Seitan Alzheimer's disease Food guide pyramid Gluten-free, casein-free diet Hamster Coronary heart disease Carpal tunnel syndrome Dog Psoriasis Raw milk South Beach diet Lactobacillus acidophilus Ramen Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Anorexia nervosa Menstrual cycle Obsessive-compulsive disorder Bengali cuisine Cuisine of Brazil

how come vegans can't eat honey just curious is honey vegan again it depends on one's definition of vegan insects are animals and so insect products such as honey and silk are not traditionally considered vegan many vegans however are not opposed to using insect products because they do not believe insects are conscious of pain moreover even if insects were conscious of pain it's not clear that the production of honey involves any more pain for insects than the production of most vegetables since the harvesting and transportation of all vegetables involves many 'collateral' insect deaths the question remains a matter of scientific debate and personal choice however when cooking or labeling food for vegans particularly vegans you don't know it's best to be on the safe side and not include honey  Veganism Vegetarianism Kosher foods Food Animal rights Peter Singer Foodborne illness Korean cuisine Hard-line Vegetarian cuisine Kashrut Raw food diet Livestock Sausage Insect Ethical consumerism People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Organic farming Vegetarian nutrition Taboo food and drink Dieting Factory farming Ecology Spider Abortion debate Unclean animals Buddhist cuisine Chocolate Human Gelatin Wine Breakfast Cuisine of Brazil Organic food Pancake Manna Paleolithic diet Traditional Chinese medicine Hamster Pesticide Egg (food) Pizza Rice Diseases of the honeybee Tofu Meat analogue Artificial consciousness Fruitarianism Soul Genetic engineering Nutrition Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Terri Schiavo Bee Rapeseed Genetically modified food Death Fugu Cuisine of Africa Dairy Porridge Animism Culture of Africa Acorn Sustainable agriculture Fast food Scientific method Food preservation Stomach cancer Food guide pyramid Healthy eating Green Revolution Alcohol fuel French cuisine Soy milk Guinea pig Food science Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Whaling Cochineal Addiction Jewish cuisine Fairtrade labelling Global warming and agriculture Chicken Capital punishment Aspartame Traumatic brain injury Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Maize Freeganism Atkins Nutritional Approach Meaning of life Gaucho (insecticide)

in your opinion is a vegetarian diet the healthiest real food for real people good for every body incredible edible the basic four food groups and the question almost every vegetarian is most tired of answering where do you get your protein let's face it folks agribusiness is trying to brainwash us all and they've succeeded most women i know are convinced that the best way to prevent osteoporosis is to consume dairy products but the well documented fact is quite the opposite the excess protein contained in meat and dairy products actually prevents calcium absorption by the body and is a significant risk factor for osteoporosis that's right i said excess protein most americans eat too much protein most american vegetarians eat more protein than they need so protein really is not an issue at all even frances moore lappe who popularized the concept of protein complementarity in has long since admitted that getting enough protein is simply not an issue so what are the issues how about heart disease alex you are correct vegan is the way to go avoid red meats dairy and carbs like bread humans are the only species of animal that drink another species milk what do cow's drink water what do they eat grass baby animals drink mothers milk until they are old enough to walk away human babies do likewise but the dairy board has us convinced that we should be drinking cow's and goat's milk and eating cheese it's a marketing ploy i used to consume large quantities until my chiropractor told me of a study done where they found that consuming milk and other dairy products actually reduce bone density i had gotten up suddenly one day and heard a crack in my foot i broke my th metatarcil i later broke my th this was so unusual for a young male that i went and had a bone density done it came back that i had the bone density of a year old i was shocked then i remembered what the chiropractor said so i went to talk to him and he told me about nurses a year old who ate veggies and consumed no dairy and a year old that consumed dairy and meats well they both had bone density scans done the came back that she had the density of a year old and the 's came back that she had the density of a year old they had the tests done at different labs i was stunned a friend of mine's wife went vegan and would drink protein shakes with water once per day for some protein after not seeing her for months when i say her she looked amazing fresh skin lost lbs and felt healthy and had more energy  Kashrut Food Tofu Livestock Cheese Kosher foods Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Soybean Coeliac disease Nutrition Vitamin D Osteoporosis Soy milk Organic food Raw food diet Taboo food and drink Factory farming Guinea pig Domestic goat Stomach cancer Tooth Chicken Insulin Prostate cancer Low-carbohydrate diet Dairy cattle Vitamin C Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Vegetarian cuisine Omega-3 fatty acid Gelatin Genetically modified food Hamster Organic farming Hypoglycemia Soy protein Food guide pyramid Meat analogue People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Animal rights Crohn's disease In-N-Out Burger Cuisine of Brazil Environmental vegetarianism Growth hormone treatment Cyanocobalamin Cancer Tocopherol Fasting Chocolate Bovine somatotropin Coronary heart disease Zinc Fancy rat Fugu Whaling Brain Sugar substitute Weight training Vegetarianism and religion French cuisine Vitasoy Fecal incontinence Elephant Sausage Escherichia coli O157:H7 Domestic rabbit Agriculture in Australia Cuisine of the Philippines Bengali cuisine Yoghurt Dairy product Anemia Tooth enamel Raw milk Paget's disease of bone Acne Colorectal cancer Honeybee Human skin color Comanche

do you like meat substitutes i cannot stand them they are so gross i like meat substitutes quorn and quorn sausages i dislike the quorn burgers however they are like card board what i dont understand is why all people think vegetarians shouldn't eat meat substitutes vegetarians choose not to eat meat mainly for moral reasons of not wanting to kill animals not because they dont like the taste or are being awkward or anything meat substitutes open up a market where you can have the taste and proteins of meat but without harming any living creatures therefore it is okay but yeah i like quorn  Meat analogue Quorn Vegetarianism Egg (food) Vegetarian cuisine Sausage Hamburger Veganism Meat Kashrut Burger McDonald's Taboo food and drink Chili con carne Tofu People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Vegetarianism and religion Environmental vegetarianism Cat Animal rights Pizza Buddhist cuisine Fish and chips Lisa the Vegetarian Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Buddhism Chicken MRE Whaling Haggis French cuisine Hot dog In vitro meat Cheese Sandwich Horse meat Dieting Barbecue Pesco/pollo vegetarianism In-N-Out Burger Food Milk 613 mitzvot Domesticated turkey Slaughterhouse British cuisine Factory farming Seitan Gelatin Unclean animals Cuisine of Brazil Breakfast Russian cuisine Livestock Cuisine of Denmark Surimi Manna French fries Breastfeeding Kangaroo Chinese cuisine Atkins Nutritional Approach Kosher foods Fasting Soybean Free trade Brain Fast-food restaurant Roman eating and drinking Singlish Burger King Cuisine of Norway Soy milk Pork Culture of India Microeconomics Agriculture Gray Wolf Dog Trichinosis Vegetarian nutrition Sugar substitute Japanese cuisine Gumbo Napoleon Dynamite Cuisine of the Southern United States Breakfast cereal Raw food diet Protein Halaal Supply and demand Japanese tea ceremony Domestic goat Red meat Fugu Taiwanese cuisine Guinea pig Kiwifruit

telling my parents im going vegetarian again last summer i decided to become vegetarian for the moral issues related to animal slaughter for meat clothing etc then came the guilt trap i was bombarded with all these questions and got told lots of stories bearing in mind was now a year and two months later i want to try again i have been thinking about it for a while but how do i tell my parents im going vegetarian again because last time i had my mom crying because i was going to die i know this is not true bearing in mind i am and have ocd so i find it hard to say these kind of things thanks for any support adam there is a japanese analogy proverb that goes like this the nail that sticks up is the one that gets hammered down people are like this everywhere when you tell your family that it is your personal belief that animals should not be eaten they take a look at themselves and it can be subconsciously translated into what you do is wrong and i choose to be right your parents have probably been taught a huge amount of misinformation by their parents and their teachers while growing up you really need to research vegetarian diets and health before you even think about saying the v word in front of your parents when you have gathered enough information and feel confident in a vegetarian diet's ability to maintain or even improve health you may mention to them that you have made the decision they may be shocked angry worried curious or many other things but you must never react to their behavior and always stay calm if they are able to speak to you and respect your choice please tell them everything and answer all questions if they are rude inconsiderate judgmental violent or verbally abusive refuse to continue any conversation until they can speak to you with respect the best advice is to study everything that you can about a healthy vegetarian diet and keep yourself in good shape better than most people your age or than your friends family if possible if nobody that you know shows a genuine positive interest in your choice don't give them the privilege of the knowledge that you have gathered work your way around any attempts they make to trivialize your beliefs and if possible go shopping with your parents and buy things that aren't obvious veggie fare instead of trying to sneak fake meat into the cart toss in lentil soup peanut butter pasta fruits veggies or anything else that you have learned is needed to fill any gaps in your diet there have been vegan olympic gold medalists and vegan mothers that grow healthy human beings inside their bodies that stay vegan their entire life and stay healthy http en wikipedia org wiki carl lewis http www eatright org cps rde xchg ada hs xsl advocacy enu html draft htm if you want to become a lacto ovo vegetarian the transition should be quite simple almost all meats have widely available commercial replacements all that you have to do is replace any flesh in your diet beef pork poultry seafood with meat analogs or just leave it out altogether you should keep in mind that a journey such as this can be quite short but should just be the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this is because of the reality of factory farming in which animals that are kept alive to produce milk eggs etc suffer much more and longer than animals that are raised to a certain weight and then slaughtered http www veganoutreach org whyvegan http meat org some people use the word vegan in reference to this idea but be aware that applying that label to yourself should always come with the inclusion of wise activism and advocacy http www veganoutreach org advocacy index html two extremely important examples of this are that you should never speak to someone about vegetarianism veganism without their consent and genuine interest or as a comment on what they are eating and your dietary beliefs should never be used as an introduction or explanation of who you are as a person veg ism should be something that comes up after people get to know you and they offer you a situation that makes it confusing to withhold the information discussion also if you are presented something that you choose not to eat or you are ordering food eating together somewhere picking the best place to eat a responsible vegan always studies the subject of their own health and how to keep their body completely provided for in every sense http www veganhealth org sh to neglect their body is to define a plant based diet as unhealthy and is the opposite of helping the animals when you you hold off on the subject until it's necessary and then act like it isn't a big deal at all people are usually surprised and way more interested and curious than if you were to bring it up when someone's eating or just using it as a conversation starter just to clear things up the vegetarian vegan diet is not composed of salads vegetables fruit and fake meat fruits and vegetables are always important but they do not make up the largest portion of any healthy diet a balanced plant based diet includes grains breads pasta rice cereal legumes soy beans peas lentils fruit and vegetables http www pcrm org health veginfo vsk food groups html http www peta org accidentallyvegan http www veganoutreach org whyvegan eating html being vegan can be an art one whose challenge is to take things that involve the suffering of the innocent and change them into something free of cruelty a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential technically the term vegetarian does imply that you don't consume anything that comes from the body of an animal that requires killing it many ingredients such as gelatin and glycerin are found in many candies fig newtons and many of other foods as well as rennet found in many cheeses http www happycow net health animal ingredients html the best thing to remember is to take your time so that for example when you are comfortable not eating beef and pork you can then give up chicken when you are sure you can make the commitment permanently depending on your age or reliance on parents or regional options it may not be best to give yourself a label the important thing is to do your best to make progress and be committed to your compassion towards animals never put your focus onto what you or other people use to describe yourself if you meet someone that talks down to people for eating meat dairy etc or to you because they think they are more veg than you laugh in their face and tell them they are a disgrace to the entire philosophy people like this only hurt the idea of veg ism and the animals the point of all of this is to live compassionately and and as free from cruelty as you can all the while maintaining your health and a positive attitude people who don't maintain either need not open their mouths and represent our beliefs if you actually choose to read all of this i hope it helps if not

what do you think about a survey in new zealand identified vegansexuals definition no sex with carnivores sample quotes from respondents i would not want to be intimate with someone whose body is literally made up from the bodies of others who have died for their sustenance non vegetarian bodies smell different to me they are after all literally sustained through carcasses i believe we are what we consume so i really struggle with bodily fluids especially sexually i couldn't think of kissing lips that allow dead animal pieces to pass between them when you are vegan or vegetarian you are very aware that when people eat a meaty diet they are kind of a graveyard for animals i can't agree with the first quote i can't say meat eaters really smell differently unless you're talking about their breath or they've just walked out of a steak house but i agree with how they feel about not wanting to be intimate with an omnivore if i were to date someone i'd just want them to have the same values as me most people would feel the same way whether it's about being vegan religion or how you look at life in general  Vegetarianism Veganism Human sexual behavior Kashrut Raw food diet Carnivore Dieting Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Cat Sense People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Death Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Food Human Egg (food) Vegetarianism and religion Tofu Hindu Christian vegetarianism Meat Oral sex Taboo food and drink Sexual orientation Puberty Environmental vegetarianism Soul Hard-line Abrahamic religion Hypoglycemia Vegetarian nutrition Lisa the Vegetarian Tasmanian Devil Punk ideology Hamburger Child sexuality Dog Buddhist cuisine French cuisine Coconut crab Lycanthropy Peter Singer Animal communication Resurrection of Jesus Social rule Nile crocodile Guinea pig Brain Sausage Whaling Hinduism Eating Sexual attraction Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sexually-transmitted infection Slaughterhouse Fasting Cuisine of Brazil Priestly Code Kosher foods Maimonides Book of Isaiah Species Zinc Straight edge Breastfeeding YuYu Hakusho Bondage (BDSM) Mojave people Teen Girl Squad Hot dog Unconscious mind Milton H.

where can i get free range cage free eggs don t tell me trader joes cuz idk where that is i goes to albertsons heb and other crappy stores omg there's barely even a difference between caged eggs and non caged visit http www goveg com organic eggs asp to know more although many consumers believe that labels such as free range free roaming or cage free mean that these chickens spend their days in natural outdoor settings the label means something entirely different to the egg industry hens on commercial cage free farms are not kept in cages but they still have their sensitive beaks cut off with a hot blade and are crammed together in filthy sheds where they will live for years until their egg production wanes and they're sent to slaughter they never go outside breathe fresh air feel the sun on their backs or do anything else that is natural or important to them they suffer from the same lung lesions and ammonia burns as hens in cages and they have breast blisters to add to their suffering although hens in cage free systems are clearly better off than hens in cages just imagine a cat or dog living in a tiny cage for two years with five to six other cats or dogs and never leaving that cage until it's time for slaughter their bodily condition can actually be worse because they are taken from cages and plopped down in their own excrement for years at a time this does not mean that cages are good which the industry might claim but from an animal welfare perspective cage free means much better but still extraordinarily cruel  Chicken Dairy Livestock Domestic rabbit People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Factory farming Vegetarianism Egg (food) Guinea pig Veganism Fancy rat Animal rights Organic food Capercaillie Kosher foods Foie gras Lung Natural gas Fox hunting Agriculture Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Kashrut Hamster Fur farming Malignant melanoma Cat Bird Free trade Egg (biology) Cuisine of Malaysia Fish farming Pysanka Microeconomics Shark Omega-3 fatty acid Billboard Hot 100 Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Breastfeeding Champagne (beverage) Psoriasis Animal testing Sinfest Animal Liberation Front Animal Farm Music Modernism Trapping Menstrual cycle Organic farming Ferret Hydrogen economy Zoophilia Copyleft RuneScape economy Toilet humour Day-Age Creationism Renewable energy Philosophy of language Existentialism Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Alignment (role-playing games) Barbecue Coffee Theory of conduct Plastic Tofu Sheikh Abdullah Vlad III Dracula Hypoglycemia Fire fighting Sulfur John Cage Mikhail Bulgakov Garfield Food Onomatopoeia Oddworld Vampire Energy development Cerebellum H5N1 Johnny Cash Tuberculosis Wi-Fi Taikyoku shogi Weed control Mixed martial arts Dog Dioxin RuneScape quests Sewage treatment Zerg Coconut crab LSD Drowning Decompression sickness

is it hard to date someone who is not a vegan or vegetarian well i was reading an article last night and i saw some shocking statements from vegans and vegetarians a couple stated that it is gross just thinking that their partners body is like a cemementary for animals whats your view on that and yes i am a proud vegetarian cemetery lol sorry a survey in new zealand identified vegansexuals definition no sex with carnivores sample quotes from respondents i would not want to be intimate with someone whose body is literally made up from the bodies of others who have died for their sustenance non vegetarian bodies smell different to me they are after all literally sustained through carcasses i believe we are what we consume so i really struggle with bodily fluids especially sexually i couldn't think of kissing lips that allow dead animal pieces to pass between them when you are vegan or vegetarian you are very aware that when people eat a meaty diet they are kind of a graveyard for animals most people prefer to date others with similar views and veg ns are no exception the people quoted in the article had the most nutball sounding reasons though because for the vast majority of us it's about practical concerns not what people ate and absorbed into their body years ago sheesh and the inventor of the term vegansexual needs to get a grip because it's as silly as coming up with conservativesexual liberalsexual or christiansexual since those are all examples where they are likely to only date within their group it's funny you mention this though because another vegan group was just discussing how ridiculous this article is http community livejournal com veganism html nc  Vegetarianism Veganism Oral sex Kashrut Human sexual behavior Raw food diet Environmental vegetarianism Hindu Dieting Shit Sexual orientation Pesco/pollo vegetarianism People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Teen Girl Squad Vegetarian nutrition Punk ideology Food Priestly Code Prostate cancer Person Resurrection of Jesus Vegetarianism and religion Masturbation Abrahamic religion Tasmanian Devil Child sexuality Buddhist cuisine Cat HTML element Hard-line Peter Singer Atheism Heterosexuality Human Animal communication Condom Autism rights movement Transgender Species Death Anal sex Zoophilia Polyamory Domestic violence Kosher foods Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Tofu Puberty Hinduism Cremation Straight edge Lawrence v.

is the fiber in cooked beans as good as the fiber in raw veggies i think i heard that if you cook a food with fiber it softens the fibers and it's not as good for you as the raw stuff but you obviously can't eat uncooked beans though with beans you just about have to cook them unless you want to eat them as sprouts however cooking beans does nothing to diminish the health benefits from eating them including beans in the diet on a regular basis can help control weight beans are low in both fat and calories and high in dietary fiber and protein the dietary fiber in beans helps slow the absorption of carbohydrate which may prevent hunger from re occurring as soon as a diabetic i appreciate the high content of dietary fiber in beans especially soluble fiber which helps slow the absorption rate of carbohydrate a slower rate of carbohydrate absorption moderates blood sugar peaks related to food intake the nutrient profile of beans contributes to heart health beans are low in total fat saturated fat and sodium they are high in dietary fiber especially soluble fiber folate a b vitamin potassium and other minerals beans help maintain normal ranges for several risk factors for heart disease blood cholesterol blood pressure and blood homocysteine levels beans are a good source of resistant starch the breakdown products from resistant starch appear to play a role in reducing the risk of colon cancer beans are an excellent protein source for vegetarians providing more than twice as much protein per serving as cereal grains combining beans and cereal grains together provides all the protein building blocks amino acids required in the diet beans are also a good source of iron and zinc for vegetarians who consume no meat we should all include cup of beans several times each week combined with a well balanced diet a recent clinical trial showed a reduced risk of heart disease for legume eaters  Nutrient Prostate cancer Diabetes mellitus Cholesterol Bodybuilding Protein Colorectal cancer Sugar substitute Crohn's disease Glycemic index Raw food diet Cheese Coffee Breastfeeding Cancer Vitamin Calorie restriction Osteoporosis Food guide pyramid Healthy eating Anorexia nervosa Zinc Cereal Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Egg (food) Common bean Glycogen storage disease type I Food preservation Bran Organic food Vitamin D Aspartame South Beach diet Coeliac disease Starch Cardiovascular disease Trans fat Tooth Stroke Growth hormone treatment Growth hormone Chocolate Homocysteine Glucocorticoid Glucokinase Beet Obstetrics Garlic Caffeine Peanut Ramen Haemochromatosis Cystic fibrosis Exercise Paleolithic diet Soul food Fecal incontinence Cheerios Genetically modified food Rice Natt__ Stomach cancer Kidney Acne Fruitarianism Multiple sclerosis Liver Blood pressure

from vegetarian to pescetarian what is the best way to transition from a vegetarian diet to a pescetarian diet without getting really sick i've heard from alot of people that if you botch the transition you'll find yourself vomiting alot for a while since your body isn't used to processing meat in order to shut down any sort of off topic arguments that may flare up as a result i always see them here on y answers regardless of what the question is so i think this is completely justifiable this is not an ethics standpoint i just feel that a pescetarian diet will offer me more in the realm of health see omega fatty acids a piscivore is an organism that lives solely on fish i e a walrus source http en wikipedia org wiki piscivore a pescetarian is regarded as being a vegetarian variant while it may not fall in line with the strict vegetarian definition of no flesh it is a widely recognized and used term as is pesco vegetarian source http en wikipedia org wiki pescetarian and webster's new millennium dictionary of english preview edition in defense of mookie monkees use of the word piscivore you are using wikipedia as a source wiki is completely wrong on the subject of vegetarianism i would suggest getting your definitions about this from a vegetarian website and in that wiki or a related wiki link they actually recognize that the word piscivore was a known word to describe human fish eaters long before pescetarian came along the literal definition of a piscivore is a fish eating animal it doesn't have to mean lives only off of fish like i already said it has been used for centuries to describe human fish eaters pescetarian pescevegetarian was coined sometime in the last something years and it means believer of fish to answer your question i would say to ease into eating fish do what's right for you but as i'm sure you already know omega 's can be found in a vegetarian diet easily good luck  Vegetarianism Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Veganism Omega-3 fatty acid Vegetarianism and religion Kashrut Buddhism Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Peter Singer Coronary heart disease Goodness and value theory Egg (food) Wiki Wikipedia Animal rights Oily fish Dieting Simone Weil Christian Vegetarian Association Meat Person Vitamin C Dictionary Nutrition Prostate cancer Objectivist philosophy Nicomachean Ethics Christian anarchism Animism Food Vegetarian nutrition Science Theory of conduct Uniform Resource Locator Tofu Atkins Nutritional Approach Hinduism Whaling Philosophy G__del's incompleteness theorem Taboo food and drink Internet troll Evil Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Guns, Germs, and Steel Meaning of life Sant Mat Cat Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism A Course In Miracles Lisa the Vegetarian Controversies in autism Species Sola fide God Economics Alignment (role-playing games) Socrates Greek language Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Soybean Creationism Vitamin Transsexuality Hindu Meme God Emperor of Dune Biodiversity Taoism Logic Cheese Cult Scientology beliefs and practices Abortion debate Stone Age Hiberno-English Fallacy Biology Aztec Hamburger Presuppositional apologetics Ontological argument Soul The nature of God in Western theology Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Religion Epistemology Atheism Polyamory Fundamentalism Encyclopedia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Autism

natural flavors vegan or no i seen it on a package of motts no sugar added applesauce and it has natural flavors i know some is meat derived but is that also meat derived you've most likely got a bigger problem than the natural flavors they list mott's is one of several large 'fruit product' companies that uses animal based enzymes in the processing of their fruit before everyone starts tding me here's the deal with enzymes and fruit products under us and canadian maybe uk food law food processing companies are allowed to not list ingredients that are used to process the food product and are substantially destroyed or degraded during the processing of the final product mott's and quite a few other juice companies use animal based digestive enzymes to break down the cellulose walls in the fruit so that more fluid juice can be extracted from the fruit in production of products like applesauce these same enzymes mean less cooking is needed to break the apples down into sauce saves a lot on their power bill g since the enzymes are destroyed as they break the cell walls they are under the law no longer present in the product and so the law allows the company to not list that they use them don't believe me contact the company and ask them how they process their fruit evil grin  Food Veganism Brewery Enzyme Kosher foods Raw food diet Beer Honey Cheese Gastrointestinal tract Sauce Vegetarianism Vitamin C Tofu Apple Milk Rum Food preservation Alcoholic beverage Ice cream Stomach Flavouring Digestion Sewage treatment Mayonnaise Kashrut Food science Sausage Fecal incontinence Bacteria Cell (biology) Jewish cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Soy sauce Alcohol fuel Nutrition Starch Chocolate Cuisine of Africa Halaal Soybean Gelatin Vinegar Dairy Tooth Auxin Soy milk Natt__ Protein Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of the Philippines Brewing French cuisine Bread Aspartame Yoghurt Organic food Pancreas Lactose intolerance Domesticated turkey Coffee Sake Black pepper Sauerkraut Cuisine of the Southern United States Glycerin Champagne (beverage) Pasteurization Japanese cuisine Cantonese cuisine Healthy eating Hamster Compost Bacon Ramen Peruvian cuisine Nutmeg Banana Ketchup Apple pie Foodborne illness Soup Stock (food) Refrigerator car Ham Cuisine of Singapore Polish cuisine Salad Cajun cuisine Glucose Egg (food)

good excuse for not becoming vegan i love the taste of meat because that's something ingrained in me by family and general society growing up now as an adult i have become aware of the atrocious way animals are raised and processed for human consumption so i want to become vegan it's a hard slow transition since i like meat so now and then i come up with several useless excuses which i ultimately know don't hold any weight what about this excuse though i've been reading articles on the internet and have not come across someone who has addressed this excuse the meat dairy egg industry will continue to do what they do anyway as encouraged by the government so what's the harm in me continuing to eat meat if me turning into a vegan won't really change anything on the planet i admire your honesty however yes it makes a difference for every person that supports the meat industry it just gives the thumbs up to them that what they are doing is okay i too grew up on meat and would have never considered giving it up i developed many food allergies including meat and poultry and was forced to give it up overnight until then i had no clue how shockingly cruel the meat and milk industry was i had never had any reason to find out now that i know the truth i couldn't with a clear concience eat meat even if i could tolerate it i am quite comfortable with my vegetarian diet now over years veggie and now find meat repulsive if you choose to make the transition educate yourself on the many reasons meat is unhealthy such as it being loaded with bacteria parasites hormones steroids antibiotics etc it truly is a gross proposition when you are armed with the facts i prefer my plant and grain based diet any day i no longer crave meat in the least thanks for your honesty but i think if you were truly honest with yourself you would realize that this argument doesnt hold water it wasnt until people jumped on the cause in droves that women were allowed to vote remember the less people supporting the meat industry and the more learning the truth about it the better off we will be in the long run perhaps you can open your mind to the idea of just lowering your meat intake for now and gradually eliminate it every little bit helps it doesnt have to be an all or nothing approach  Kashrut Milk Factory farming Dieting Dairy Livestock Atkins Nutritional Approach Breastfeeding Vegetarian cuisine Organic farming Animal rights Kosher foods Taboo food and drink Nutrition Organic food Tooth Raw food diet Egg (food) Vegetarianism and religion Meat analogue Vegetarian nutrition Low-carbohydrate diet Environmental vegetarianism Whaling Cheese Agriculture Chicken Protein Omega-3 fatty acid Tofu Acne Buddhism Dog Crohn's disease Fasting Guinea pig Meat Peter Singer Transsexuality Coronary heart disease Fecal incontinence Free trade 613 mitzvot Vitamin C Cuisine of Brazil Buddhist cuisine Puberty Soy milk Alcoholics Anonymous Cat Theodicy Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Prostate cancer Brain People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Sausage Theory of conduct Slaughterhouse Obesity Zinc Honesty Domesticated turkey Neolithic Revolution Escherichia coli O157:H7 Bodybuilding Hypoglycemia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Allergy Food guide pyramid Ferret Stone Age Human Folic acid Lie Inflation Economy of the People's Republic of China Lactose intolerance Animal Liberation Front Domestication Human height Super Size Me Chocolate Ethical consumerism Clean animals Person McDonald's Colorectal cancer

a different way of easing yourself into vegetarianism a lot of people who come here want to know how to slowly become vegetarian one of the more followed methods is to drop one type of animal at a time from your diet starting with cow then moving toward pigs etc and ending after sea animals anyway i was reading something the other day that said it may be even better to start with the chickens and fish and end with cow because each plate of fish a dead fish but it takes many plates of steak to equal the death of a cow any thoughts people just ask here frequently and i was wondering if this method made sense to people who want to go veg i forgot how huge tuna fish are but many fish are small chickens are certainly quite small and feed far fewer people with their deaths than a cow then take into account all the very small animals like shrimp one dinner the death of a whole lot of shrimp lol the lillyian method you crack me up hi lillyian thats am interesting way of looking at it i guess morally it would be right if you equate each life as eqaul for some reason many do not but your suggestion has the added benefit of cutting out the animals that are not so obvious first every one knows you are not veggie if you eat beef but some people get confused about fish so if they cut out beef pig sheep first they might not bother with the fish and therefore miss the full benefit so yes your ideas sounds great and it would be interesting to see if it works for some shall we call it the lillyian method and just refer to your question link in the future sounds like a plan to me personally i advocate a clean break becasue i feel a gradual move is a constant reminder to some people that they are giving something up whereas in reality it much more postive than that  Vegetarianism Livestock Animal rights Hamburger Kashrut Japanese cuisine Peruvian cuisine Peter Singer Meat Cattle Cuisine of Malaysia Cantonese cuisine Barbecue MRE British cuisine Poker jargon Environmental vegetarianism Cuisine of the Philippines Cajun cuisine Chicken Kosher foods People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Vegetarianism and religion Korean cuisine Bovine spongiform encephalopathy About a Boy Theory of conduct Lisa the Vegetarian Slaughterhouse Dim sum Whaling Animal Dairy Ramen God Emperor of Dune Garfield Escherichia coli O157:H7 Tlingit Cuisine of Denmark Evil German cuisine Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Chili con carne Beef Dieting Hiberno-English Prostate cancer Fishery CPU cache Shrimp farm Cuisine of Africa Cuisine of Vietnam Burger Rei Ayanami Domesticated turkey Fish and chips Extreme Programming Roman eating and drinking Vegetarian cuisine Pig Password cracking Taiwanese cuisine Agriculture in Australia Objectivist philosophy Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Jewish cuisine Orca Soul food Sandwich Cat The Apprentice 2 RuneScape quests Dairy cattle Cheese Halaal Breastfeeding Agriculture RISC Have I Got News For You Factory farming Jackass: The Movie Tofu Hinduism Egg (food) Vegetarian nutrition Buddhism Guinea pig Scientific method Douglas Adams Sushi Hypnosis Henry Cow

organic facial scrubs my aunt was telling me that now that my acne is clearing up i need a facial scrub i don't want to use those scrubs that have the nasty chamicals in them and i don't want them to be tested on animals i was wondering if there was a scrub like that a vegan facial scrub or a scrub that i can make with types of foods like bananas or something please help i saw the one comment about using sea salt before you possibly attempt such i would like to remind you that salt can be and is used to remove tattoo's when there is no laser present using it to scrub on your face is something that i would strongly suggest that you not do my suggestion is to just use a good quality soap my suggestion would be dr bronner's it is not tested on animals no chemicals and is totally natural it is also organic free trade which means they deal with farmers directly and know the source and there is no middle man and profit goes directly to the farmer if you really feel the need to have some sort of mask or something to get the feeling that you face is really clean my suggestion would to keep totally natural and just add something like oatmeal or cornmeal to the liquid dr bronner's soap and put the paste on your face the oat cornmeal will soak up any extra oils to keep you from having problems leave it on your face for a bit then just gently wash it off if you want to go with something already made up you can always go to any of the online sites to purchase what your looking for if you don't have a health store in your area that has such items such as amazon william  Tattoo Acne Tofu Soap Dairy Sento Fecal incontinence Kosher foods Manicure Organic food Psoriasis Surveillance Milton H.

are white jordan almonds vegan i'm specifically referring to the white ones because i know that that food dyes sometimes contain animal products any jordan almond could be vegan it depends on how the sugar was processed how the dye was derived if it's done by a jewish kosher place it will be vegan as the kosher sugar and dies used cannot be insect derived you could also get them from a vegan place online to be extra careful if you wish personally i'm not a vegan but i end up buying lots of vegan desserts because i am lactose intolerant and don't want things dyed from insect stomach as common food colourant  Vegetarianism Lactose intolerance Kosher foods Cheese Soy milk Milk Chocolate Food Tofu Egg (food) Ethical consumerism Honey Wine Dye Dairy Sugar Jewish cuisine Cochineal Yoghurt Raw food diet Vegetarian cuisine Unclean animals Halaal Enzyme Gelatin Food coloring Animal rights Paleolithic diet Sugarcane Hedgehog Marshmallow Bee Agriculture Vegetarianism and religion Kosher wine Hamster Insect Taboo food and drink Cuisine of Denmark Almond Lac operon Mashgiach Hard-line Shechita Cyanocobalamin Hechsher Healthy eating Honeybee Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sugar substitute Alcohol fuel Slaughterhouse Meat Leather 613 mitzvot Pancake Abrahamic religion Aspartame Stomach cancer Carnivorous plant Date Palm Biochemistry Livestock Crohn's disease Ice cream Acetic acid Nutrition Peter Singer Upper West Side Pork Sucrose Cuisine of Brazil Genetically modified organism Breastfeeding Dairy product People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Dieting Color Shabbat Cake Calcium in biology Buddhist cuisine Cuisine Cat Nutmeg Staining (biology) Guinea pig Factory farming Animal husbandry Hummingbird Organic farming Marzipan Fruitarianism Food guide pyramid E number Sugar beet Technicolor Vegan Reich

vegetarian vegan stereo type i think it is ridiculous how meat eaters claim that vegetarians vegans are always trying to force them to not eat meat i think is the complete opposite everytime someone realizes that i don't eat meat immediately they start saying why how do you do that thats not healthy meat is good they are going to kill it anyway and i just stand there silently saying because i feel like as do most of the other vegetarians i know i have never met a meat eater who is ok with someone who doesn't eat meat or atleast who doesn't have some rude comment to state i think it is the complete opposite and that they are the ones who try and conform our beliefs who is with me it gets to the stage i try hard not to say anything about my food choices because i am told oh thats why you are so pale women need to eat red meat' you will make yourself sick oh are you a greenie saving the ducks are we you a tree hugger or the best one yet animals were put on this earth to feed us what else would we eat without meat and it must get boring eating all that lettuce i also find when people say this they dont want to hear anything else like meat is bad for you if eaten in excess or no a vegetarian diet is not about just eating lettuce now i just dont say anything as an older person nobody feels the need to lecture but as a younger girl it was awful but you know whats really interesting i dont say these things to meat eaters yeah sure not killing animals is a bonus but its more about maintaing weight and being healthy and i dont like the taste of meat i like vegetables and beans buts it the meat eaters that carry on bizzare i am with you  Veganism Hamburger Vegetarian cuisine Kashrut Dieting Vegetarianism and religion People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Raw food diet Animal rights Egg (food) Tofu Buddhist cuisine Meat Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Sausage Lisa the Vegetarian Food guide pyramid Vegetarian nutrition McDonald's Buddhism Meat analogue Punk ideology Korean cuisine Fasting Hot dog In-N-Out Burger Dim sum Cat Hunting Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Chili con carne Cheese Environmental vegetarianism Soybean Coronary heart disease French cuisine Yoda Domestic rabbit Domesticated turkey Food Mojave people Whaling Peruvian cuisine Dog Ron Weasley Burger Little Britain Joke Binge eating disorder Jewish cuisine Chicken Factory farming Piccolo Junior Saga Ramen Protein Theory of conduct Invader Zim Chinese cuisine Cuisine of Brazil Teen Girl Squad Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Kosher foods Comanche 613 mitzvot Salad Fingers The Young Ones (TV series) The Catcher in the Rye Cuisine of Vietnam MyPyramid Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Foodborne illness Friends Goat Curry Meat Loaf Cat food Cuisine of the Southern United States Peter Singer Fugu Nicomachean Ethics Cuisine of the Philippines Gray Wolf Vitamin C Simone Weil Anemia Fecal incontinence Cuisine of Malaysia Red meat Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Omega-3 fatty acid

would you go out with a meat eater i am vegan and would find it hard going out with a meat eater especially those meat eaters who are narrow minded and think you are not getting the correct nutrition ect when i was single there wasn't much choice as nearly every guy that i'd meet was a meat eater the way that a guy reacted to my being veg was a deciding factor though if he was open minded about it didn't find it hilarious to 'rib' me about it bad pun sorry i'd be open to seeing if we were compatable on a non culinary level i couldn't believe how many guys thought it was sooo witty to phone me describe what they were eating the guy i was seeing when i went veg still ate meat but he'd eat veg whenever we ate together he didn't understand why i stopped eating meat however we had very different ideals in a lot of other areas too my so ate meat when we got together i let him know it was his choice but i wasn't cooking it for him he enjoys my cooking became intrigued with what i had when we went out to eat also he is an open compassionate person could understand why i'm veg after a few conversations he gradually became veg during our st year together  Veganism Meat Loaf Vegetarianism Dieting Vegetarian nutrition Bengali cuisine Buddhism Raw food diet Time Out of Mind Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Atkins Nutritional Approach Shaggy dog story RuneScape skills Chinese cuisine Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Kashrut Ray Winstone Kitchen Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest Social rule Tofu Salad Fingers Pitaten Discordianism Ramen Korean cuisine Vegetarianism and religion Pun Barbecue Food One Tree Hill (TV series) Chili con carne Steak Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Buddhist cuisine Pizza Coronary heart disease Humphrey Bogart MyPyramid Taboo food and drink 24 Hours of Le Mans Free will Piccolo Junior Saga Kasparov versus The World Steve Jobs Stewie Griffin IBM PC compatible Egg (food) Sausage French cuisine The Contender (television series) Hamburger Cheese Peruvian cuisine Lord Voldemort Brain Clinical depression In-N-Out Burger Vitamin C Cannibalism Blood on the Tracks A Course In Miracles Garlic Stomach cancer People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals The Ashlee Simpson Show W.

i'm a vegetarian almost vegan and i don't get enough protein veggies vegans what's your fave protein ok to everyone who has accused me of implied that i am perpetuating the myth i didn't post this question to have any particular reaction from you i was only looking for some ideas i thought someone would come up with something that i had overlooked for those who asked i did a nutritional analysis with my nutritionist and she suggested that i up my protein intake a bit not a ton just a bit so please relax i didn't mean to upset you i'm coming to this question of yours late relatively speaking so don't think i'm beating up on you with this answer g you say a nutritionist said you needed more protein but they didn't have any suggestions that's a major part of what their supposed to do g how did they come to this highly unusual diagnosis that you were short on protein are they up on the latest knowledge about protein needs the latest advice based on decades of studying human protein needs is to have protein consist at most of your calories in other words on a calorie diet you would want no more than calories of any protein i e less than grams the reason i bring all that up is that the scientists wanted the recommendation to be but raised it after 'protein' industry pressure nutritionists that aren't keeping up with the research are still advising clients to consume much larger amounts than the body uses i suspect yours falls into this category now on to the good stuff that you can't possibly think is me picking on you vbg my favorite source of protein is the humble potato it's exactly the right percentage of protein calories and over a century of research shows that it contains all the protein people need next on my list is soy and other beans grains esp corn maize and leafy vegetables did you know that a standard serving of something as icky and useless as iceberg lettuce has about a gram of usable protein other greens like spinach mustard turmip etc have as much as grams per serving and they're all low calorie proteins g you might want to follow this link and use their pantry section to compute your daily values and get ideas on foods you might like to add or remove from your diet http www nutritiondata com  Atkins Nutritional Approach Dieting Omega-3 fatty acid Milk Dietary fiber Soybean Vegetarian nutrition Food Tofu Calorie Healthy eating Vitamin C Folic acid Nutrition Guinea pig Breastfeeding Low-carbohydrate diet Tocopherol Cheese Egg (food) Hypoglycemia Raw food diet Coronary heart disease Agriculture Organic food Peruvian cuisine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Obesity Maize Coeliac disease In-N-Out Burger Gelatin Soy milk Biodiesel Prostate cancer Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Paleolithic diet Alcoholic beverage Trans fat Origin of life Hamster Hamburger Stomach cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Famine McDonald's MyPyramid Energy Bodybuilding Plame affair Iron Alcohol fuel Genetically modified food Alzheimer's disease Francis Crick Coffee Little Britain Life extension Soy protein Cyanocobalamin Bengali cuisine Aztec Rice Theory of conduct Fancy rat Glycemic index Herpes simplex virus Chocolate Cuisine of Brazil Natt__ Potato Brain South Beach diet Crohn's disease Aspartame Psychology HIV test Domesticated turkey Insulin Cat Ferret Nutrient Ramen Pet skunk The Skeptical Environmentalist Anorexia nervosa Brewery Barbecue Standard enthalpy change of fusion

which legume other than peanuts is your favorite i guess i should add that cashews almonds etc are not legumes they are nuts the reason i mentioned peanuts is because they're legumes which everyone likes and thinks they're nuts chickpeas although to prepare them is a bit painful but you can get them soft in cans i rinse them and toss them through salads or make them in to a mayonnaise based curry salad they are also great as a dip mixed with tahini paste sour cream lemon juice garlic and olive oil  Hummus Mayonnaise Cuisine of Denmark Breakfast Jewish cuisine Cuisine of Turkey Peanut butter Salad Cuisine of Greece Peruvian cuisine Curry Cuisine of Thailand Satay Catalan cuisine Tofu Soybean Cashew Food Veganism Sauce Barbecue Kelantan Idli Baba ganoush Culture of Turkey Almond Legume French cuisine Cuisine of Singapore Russian cuisine Japanese cuisine Cold Stone Creamery Sandwich Muesli Ice cream Potato salad Caesar salad Sauerkraut Cuisine of Laos German cuisine Pizza Halva Confectionery Vegetarian cuisine Yoghurt Bengali cuisine Grape seed oil Sprouting Martini cocktail D__ner kebab Kosher foods Cuisine of Africa Porridge Guacamole Fish and chips Chili con carne Street food Culinary mustard Butter Cuisine of Cambodia Bread Cheese Sour cream Soft drink Vinegar McDonald's Coconut milk Chicken soup Pulse (legume) Chaaru Food preservation Hot sauce Pancake Fruit Chutney Passover Citric acid Baklava Cantonese cuisine Lemon Paleolithic diet Cuisine of Argentina Hot dog Polish cuisine Cha chaan teng Coffee Laksa Salsa (sauce) Mango Serbian cuisine Peanuts Pickling Manchukuo and Mengchiang (agriculture, farming, lumber and fishing)

is this a good diet i only eat when i am really hungry stomache growls and i fast all day monday also i am a lacto ovo vegetarian is that a good diet or unhealthy i eat the first time my stomach growls i don't wait until it growl times lol that sounds like a crash diet you will lose weight temporarily but it will come right back at you with vengeance once you switch to your regular diet you have to adjust your diet so it becomes not something you could do months but throughout your entire life because you're a vegetarian you're getting much less fat than meat eaters so you can relax about your diet eat whenver you feel like eating just don't stuff yourself the only thing you should watch for is cheese and eggs so perhaps egg slices of chese a day is enough oh yeah last point fasting is definitely a bad idea nutritionally speaking the only good thing about fasting is the spiritual quality it brings to one's life  Vegetarianism Dieting Atkins Nutritional Approach Fasting Cheese Veganism Hamburger McDonald's Binge eating disorder Egg (food) Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Super Size Me Cuisine of Denmark Vegetarianism and religion Tofu The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Food guide pyramid Lisa the Vegetarian Vegetarian cuisine Milk Food Omega-3 fatty acid Breakfast Obesity Breastfeeding Low-carbohydrate diet South Beach diet Coronary heart disease Hot dog Adjustable gastric band Raw food diet In-N-Out Burger Stomach cancer Garfield Kosher foods Natural Hygiene Bread Healthy eating Tocopherol Little Britain Bodybuilding Fecal incontinence Chocolate Weight training Chinese food therapy Ramen Famine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Guinea pig Vegetarian nutrition Nutrition Weight loss Jewish cuisine MRE Cuisine of the Southern United States Shit Christian Vegetarian Association Hamster Tlingit Tae eul ju Chili con carne Dick Gregory Meat analogue Trans fat British cuisine Peruvian cuisine People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Hedgehog Fancy rat Environmental vegetarianism Buddhist cuisine Organic food Pizza Cuisine of the Philippines 613 mitzvot Buddhism Chicken Protein The Amazing Race Homer Simpson Didache Abstinence Christian vegetarianism Goodness and value theory Hindu Sandwich The Ashlee Simpson Show Prostate cancer Theory of conduct Pok__mon Abilities Junk food Mahatma Gandhi Furious Angels Fish and chips Fruitarianism Cuisine of Brazil Ekadasi Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest

if you are vegetarian can you eat eggs because i want to become a vegetarian but am not sure if you can eat eggs yes you can eat eggs and call yourself vegetarian if you want to become a lacto ovo vegetarian the transition should be quite simple almost all meats have widely available commercial replacements all that you have to do is replace any flesh in your diet beef pork poultry seafood with meat analogs or just leave it out altogether you should keep in mind that a journey such as this can be quite short but should just be the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this is because of the reality of factory farming in which animals that are kept alive to produce milk eggs etc suffer much more and longer than animals that are raised to a certain weight and then slaughtered http www veganoutreach org whyvegan http meat org some people use the word vegan in reference to this idea but be aware that applying that label to yourself should always come with the inclusion of wise activism and advocacy http www veganoutreach org advocacy index html two extremely important examples of this are that you should never speak to someone about vegetarianism veganism without their consent and genuine interest or as a comment on what they are eating and your dietary beliefs should never be used as an introduction or explanation of who you are as a person veg ism should be something that comes up after people get to know you and they offer you a situation that makes it confusing to withhold the information discussion also if you are presented something that you choose not to eat or you are ordering food eating together somewhere picking the best place to eat a responsible vegan always studies the subject of their own health and how to keep their body completely provided for in every sense http www veganhealth org sh to neglect their body is to define a plant based diet as unhealthy and is the opposite of helping the animals when you you hold off on the subject until it's necessary and then act like it isn't a big deal at all people are usually surprised and way more interested and curious than if you were to bring it up when someone's eating or just using it as a conversation starter just to clear things up the vegetarian vegan diet is not composed of salads vegetables fruit and fake meat fruits and vegetables are always important but they do not make up the largest portion of any healthy diet a balanced plant based diet includes grains breads pasta rice cereal legumes soy beans peas lentils fruit and vegetables http www pcrm org health veginfo vsk food groups html http www peta org accidentallyvegan http www veganoutreach org whyvegan eating html being vegan can be an art one whose challenge is to take things that involve the suffering of the innocent and change them into something free of cruelty a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential technically the term vegetarian does imply that you don't consume anything that comes from the body of an animal that requires killing it many ingredients such as gelatin and glycerin are found in many candies fig newtons and many of other foods as well as rennet found in many cheeses http www happycow net health animal ingredients html the best thing to remember is to take your time so that for example when you are comfortable not eating beef and pork you can then give up chicken when you are sure you can make the commitment permanently depending on your age or reliance on parents or regional options it may not be best to give yourself a label the important thing is to do your best to make progress and be committed to your compassion towards animals never put your focus onto what you or other people use to describe yourself if you meet someone that talks down to people for eating meat dairy etc or to you because they think they are more veg than you laugh in their face and tell them they are a disgrace to the entire philosophy people like this only hurt the idea of veg ism and the animals the point of all of this is to live compassionately and and as free from cruelty as you can all the while maintaining your health and a positive attitude people who don't maintain either need not open their mouths and represent our beliefs if you actually choose to read all of this i hope it helps if not feel free to e mail me if you have questions i'm vegan and these are some of my favorite things to eat breakfast bananas cream of wheat with brown sugar and soy butter cereal pancakes or french toast with real maple syrup vegan sausage patties smoothies lunch vegan sausage sandwiches sandwiches with vegan deli slices tofurkey is the only one that's kinda funky fruit dinner leftovers couscous salad

how can i convince my parents to let me become a vegan i've been a vegetarian for about a year now on the th of august it will be exactly a year i really think i am ready to give up eggs and dairy from my diet but my parents are dead against it my mom told me that as long as i live with her i am not becoming a vegan but everytime i eat dairy or eggs i feel guilty and grossed out there aren't a lot of vegan friendly foods in the house except for soy milk help there is a japanese analogy proverb that goes like this the nail that sticks up is the one that gets hammered down people are like this everywhere when you tell your family that it is your personal belief that animals should not be eaten they take a look at themselves and it can be subconsciously translated into what you do is wrong and i choose to be right there have been many vegans before us that have done their best to stay healthy and most have succeeded but many have made mistakes and luckily people have been keeping track for those of us that wish to avoid those mistakes http www veganhealth org sh your parents have probably been taught a huge amount of misinformation by their parents and their teachers while growing up you really need to research vegetarian diets and health before you even think about saying the v word in front of your parents when you have gathered enough information and feel confident in a vegan diet's ability to maintain or even improve health you may mention to them that you have made the decision they may be shocked angry worried curious or many other things but you must never react to their behavior and always stay calm if they are able to speak to you and respect your choice please tell them everything and answer all questions if they are rude inconsiderate judgmental violent or verbally abusive refuse to continue any conversation until they can speak to you with respect the best advice is to study everything that you can about a healthy vegan diet and keep yourself in good shape better than most people your age or than your friends family if possible if nobody that you know shows a genuine positive interest in your choice don't give them the privilege of the knowledge that you have gathered work your way around any attempts they make to trivialize your beliefs and if possible go shopping with your parents and buy things that aren't obvious veggie fare instead of trying to sneak fake meat into the cart toss in lentil soup peanut butter pasta fruits veggies or anything else that you have learned is needed to fill any gaps in your diet one of the most valuable steps is to study a balanced vegan diet and learn how to cook prepare everything that you will need to keep yourself satisfied before you start to label yourself as vegan this is important in keeping yourself healthy and working towards a fit body that can redefine vegan stereotypes your journey as vegetarian was just the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this should be due to the reality of factory farming in which animals that are kept alive to produce milk eggs etc suffer much more and longer than animals that are raised to a certain weight and then slaughtered http www veganoutreach org whyvegan http meat org some people use the word vegan in reference to this idea but be aware that applying that label to yourself should always come with the inclusion of wise activism and advocacy http www veganoutreach org advocacy index html two extremely important examples of this are that you should never speak to someone about vegetarianism veganism without their consent and genuine interest or as a comment on what they are eating and your dietary beliefs should never be used as an introduction or explanation of who you are as a person veg ism should be something that comes up after people get to know you and they offer you a situation that makes it confusing to withhold the information discussion also if you are presented something that you choose not to eat or you are ordering food eating together somewhere picking the best place to eat a responsible vegan always studies the subject of their own health and how to keep their body completely provided for in every sense http www veganhealth org sh to neglect their body is to define a plant based diet as unhealthy and is the opposite of helping the animals when you you hold off on the subject until it's necessary and then act like it isn't a big deal at all people are usually surprised and way more interested and curious than if you were to bring it up when someone's eating or just using it as a conversation starter a balanced plant based diet includes grains breads pasta rice cereal legumes soy beans peas lentils fruit and vegetables http www pcrm org health veginfo vsk food groups html http www peta org accidentallyvegan http www veganoutreach org whyvegan eating html being vegan can be an art one whose challenge is to take things that involve the suffering of the innocent and change them into something free of cruelty a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential technically the term vegetarian does imply that you don't consume anything that comes from the body of an animal that requires killing it many ingredients such as gelatin and glycerin are found in many candies fig newtons and many of other foods as well as rennet found in many cheeses http www happycow net health animal ingredients html the best thing to remember is to take your time so that for example when you are comfortable not eating whey and casein you can then give up sodium stearoyl lactylate and l cysteine when you are sure you can make the commitment permanently depending on your age or reliance on parents or regional options it may not be best to give yourself a label the important thing is to do your best to make progress and be committed to your compassion towards animals never put your focus onto what you or other people use to describe yourself if you meet someone that talks down to people for eating meat dairy etc or to you because they think they are more veg than you laugh in their face and tell them they are a disgrace to the entire philosophy people like this only hurt the idea of veg ism and the animals the point of all of this is to live compassionately and and as free from cruelty as you can all the while maintaining your health and a positive attitude people who don't maintain either need not open their mouths and represent our beliefs if you actually choose to read all of this i hope it helps if not feel free to e mail me if you have questions i'm vegan and these are some of my favorite things to eat breakfast bananas cream of wheat with brown sugar and soy butter cereal pancakes or french toast with real maple syrup vegan sausage patties smoothies lunch vegan sausage sandwiches sandwiches with vegan deli slices tofurkey is the only one that's kinda funky fruit dinner leftovers couscous salad vegan sushi potato or pasta salad dinner sloppy joes sausage and gravy with homemade biscuits spaghetti and trader joe's meatballs or tvp lasagna thai pad see ew pad khi mao drunkard's noodles pad prig king tofu eggplant with basil sauce yellow thai curry with tofu or vegan chikn and veggies and jasmine rice indian dal with homemade roti or dosai channa masala aloo gobi vegetable or

how do i use tofu i have never before used tofu and i'm very low on money i'm what do you expect i'm not quiet sure what to do with it truth be told i've found recipes online but i'm weary of trying them because i can't go out and buy tofu all the time also some people i've asked say it tastes horrible and other's say the it depends on how you cook it and there's so many different kind the recipes i look at use tofu in replacement of chicken so basically how do i find the right kind of tofu for what i'm cooking and how should i go about the whole process i'm sure you guys are much better at it than me i know it's not the only way i can get protein but since i don't know how to use it at all i figured that i should at least learn how to use it and see if i like it etc ok so i've never had tofu before is there anything that it tastes like what should i expect from it tofu is mostly tasteless but that's a good thing it means you flavor it however you want i love the stuff could eat it times a day the easiest type of tofu to cook with is extra firm you'll find it in the refrigerated section near the produce in your supermarket it will be a block of tofu in a package with water labeled extra firm try this recipie i love it take the tofu out of the package drain it well mash it up with a fork until it looks like feta cheese put it in a non stick frying pan with maybe a little oil set the pan on medium add black pepper a couple dashes of soy sauce some chicken flavored seasoning if you can find some made without actual chicken and nutritional yeast flakes if you can find them if not try adding some garlic powder onion powder and tumeric watch the salt if you use soysauce or chicken flavor seasoning both those things are salty so if you use them you don't need to add salt let it simmer in those seasonings stirring only often enough to keep it from sticking to the pan when all the moisture extra water is gone and the tofu doesn't look so raw anymore then add some salsa my favorite original style pace picante mild and or some chopped diced tomatoes be sure to wait till tofu is almost done to add tomato products tomatoes can make other ingredients stop cooking let tofu cook with salsa and tomatoes for a couple more minutes remove from heat eat this scrambled tofu with a spoonfull of sour cream on a warm tortilla yum another maybe even easier recipie drain the block of tofu well cut into cubes whichever size you want put the cubes of tofu in a bowl large enough to stir them in add some soysauce and ginger powder stir gently you don't want to break the cubes up too much but you want to make sure the soy sauce and ginger powder gets on all the tofu let it sit in this mixture for a few minutes maybe fry in a non stick pan or with a little oil until you see hints of brown on the tofu it is super yummy on rice with sweet and sour sauce or you can add it to your stir fry vegetables asian noodles whatever asian food you want  Pancake Nabemono In-N-Out Burger Basic taste Natt__ Brewery Sauce Cuisine of the Southern United States Soybean Pot Noodle Vegetarian cuisine German cuisine Cuisine of Africa Seitan Gumbo Pasta Soup Hot pot Potato Kraft Dinner Chinese cuisine Veganism Dumpling Cuisine of Cambodia Stir frying Stock (food) Soul food Rice Polish cuisine Cincinnati chili Tea McDonald's Food Coffee Miso Food preservation Dim sum Chicken Soy protein Cha chaan teng Rum Taiwanese cuisine D__ner kebab Risotto Cuisine of Greece Potato chips Canadian Chinese cuisine Beer Fish and chips Sake Beef noodle soup Domesticated turkey Chocolate Fried rice Ginger Meat analogue Milk Vegetarianism Kebab Cholent Porridge

complicated vegetarian ok heres the deal my husband and i want to become vegetarians but not cut out eggs milk or fish is there a name for this second i have a really screwed up stomach colon i have corosion in my stomach lining from acid reflux i take prilosec twice daily i have gas and have had constipation all my life i am allergic to leeks and i think i am allergic to scallions not confirmed how do i start this type of vegetarianism and is there a great website where i can get some free help also i have kids who are picky i need recipes that they will like i am not much of a cook so they need to be fairly easy thanks thank you for your answers i can't go to the doctor though because i have no insurance like so many other ppl and i have fibromyalgia i am hoping this type of diet will help with it please be aware vegetarians do not eat cows pigs chickens fish shrimp scallops worms ants or any other animal eating fish is praised for its omega content but it is also know for its heavy metal content such as mercury if you want all of the health benefits of fish eat a few tablespoons of ground flax seeds with some peanut butter on some toast celery or anything else if you want to become a lacto ovo vegetarian the transition should be quite simple almost all meats have widely available commercial replacements all that you have to do is replace any flesh in your diet beef pork poultry seafood with meat analogs or just leave it out altogether you should keep in mind that a journey such as this can be quite short but should just be the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this is because of the reality of factory farming in which animals that are kept alive to produce milk eggs etc suffer much more and longer than animals that are raised to a certain weight and then slaughtered http www veganoutreach org whyvegan http meat org some people use the word vegan in reference to this idea but be aware that applying that label to yourself should always come with the inclusion of wise activism and advocacy http www veganoutreach org advocacy index html two extremely important examples of this are that you should never speak to

where is this elusive evidence recently i have been witness to a number of answers in the vegetarian vegan category stating that there is scientific proof that a vegetarian diet is nutritionally lacking i myself am a vegetarian and after exhaustive research have come to the conclusion that a thoughtful healthy vegetarian diet rich in fruits vegetables and whole grains is not only nutritionally complete but actually more healthful than a diet rich in meat i am however interested in this evidence as well as its scientific validity please don't waste my time with answers such as meat is good god made animals so we could eat them etc if you have real solid evidence please enlighten me with it i am well aware that there are no legitimate answers to this question i merely asked it to make a point if i need to spell it out for you please go shoot yourself for your foolishness personally i have not seen any over whelming evidence that meat is good for you there are a lot of people on this forum who bag vegan vegetarian diet they make these silly statements that we have have to eat meat and that is an essential protein it actually isn't the ex evegetarians who state the vegetarian diet made them sick and there are a few and they say they went to the doctor and was advised to eat meat if you read what they say they lived on candy bread crisp sandwiches and sweet coffee they did not not have a balanced diet but ate a variety of rubbish and often skipped meals being vegan is healthier than any other diet possible and that isn't even touch the hormones and antibiotics used in raising animals and the possibilities and realities of meat borne illness mad cow disease etc better for your heart proven to reduce heart disease and even reverse coronary heart disease automatically lower s your cholesterol levels the only foods that contain cholesterol are animal products like meat and dairy and since a three decade long study found that not a single subject with a cholesterol level below has ever developed heart disease that's hard to ignore vegans have lower rates of obesity coronary heart disease high blood pressure large bowel disorders cancers and gallstones reduces stroke risks and coronary artery disease reduces symptoms of fibromyalgia reduces food poisoning of food poisoning is linked to animal products your bowels will work much better therefore keeping your whole system healthier live longer healthier lives one year long study that compared meat eaters and vegetarians showed that the greater the meat consumption the greater the death rate from all causes combined increased vegetable and fruit intake reduces your need for taking a multi vitamin plus increases your antioxidant intake there is no proof what so ever that a person must eat animal flesh or any by products of animals to be healthy yet there is overwhelming proof that it truely is best not to these die hard meat eaters talk utter nonsense and are constantly making up these radical stories about vegetarians being unhealth and it real nonsense  Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cancer Food guide pyramid Egg (food) Soybean Hypercholesterolemia Coeliac disease Brain Healthy eating Anemia Livestock Word of Wisdom Growth hormone treatment Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Soy milk Animal rights Stomach cancer Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Guinea pig Organic farming Factory farming Tobacco smoking Anorexia nervosa Alcohol consumption and health Insulin Chicken Domestic rabbit Aspartame Diarrhea Tooth Dairy Cyanocobalamin Acne Protein Taboo food and drink Tofu Case-control Vegetarianism and religion Cat Oily fish Common cold Low density lipoprotein Fancy rat Vitamin D Myocardial infarction Natural Hygiene Osteoporosis Coffee Traditional Chinese medicine Hamster Escherichia coli O157:H7 Environmental vegetarianism Adjustable gastric band Stroke Alcoholism Hamburger Binge eating disorder Oral contraceptive

healthy eating ok here's my daily eating schedual it is usually pretty regular please tell me how healthy it is oh yah i run a mile a couple times a week skateboard and usually climb a lot of trees smiles so i usually get a lot of excersise but i sprained my wrist and so the doctor said no more skateboarding or tree climbing anyway here you go one bowl of crispix cereal with organic milk a glass of oj potatoe chips blushes i guess it's a pre menstrul thing vegetarian lasagna a salad and some chocolate some chocolate at the movie what can i do better for your first meal of the day cereal isnt so bad but try to eat an orange or maybe an apple and feel free to toss some peanut butter on it with breakfast its important to eat lots of fruit and in the morning if you eat something with just a little fat in it like peanut butter your metabolism gets going faster also you need protein peanut butter has it instead of potato chips look for fruit ripples they're these awesome little chips made from apples with a bit of strawberry they're delicous and one little pouch is only calories they also count as a serving of fruit http www fruitripples com when you eat dinner hopefully you're starting with the salad again that will keep your metabolism going and you've put some veggies in there sliced red green yellow or orange peppers pepperoncinis cukes tomatoes etc mushrooms olives carrots etc the lasagna isnt bad but if you can use wheat whole grain noodles and or lowfat cheese it'll be even better for you maybe instead of just eating chocolate try making some chocolate covered strawberries everyone loves them and then you're more likely to eat less chocolate on its own and more fruit and for the snack try again to stick with fruit if you can its hard to get a healthy snack at the movies but if you can pick something light thats better at the end of the day you're less active so if you eat something heavy or with lots of calories you're probably not going to burn it off before you go to bed also i'd try to toss a few more snack in there you want to eat small amounts but every few hours that keeps your metabolism going so you'll burn more no butter popcorn fruits or chocolate covered fruit veggies with fat free dips celery with low fat peanut butter etc it sounds like you eat better than average but by adding little things and making little changes you can get even better results also avoid soda one soda a day can add lbs on to your body mass and that just wont go unless you drop it instead try to get low calorie iced teas or lemonades or juices that are a high percentage of real juice and not from concentrate  Cuisine of the Philippines Chocolate Vegetarianism Snack food In-N-Out Burger Food Peruvian cuisine Vegetarian cuisine French cuisine German cuisine Pancake Dieting Bread Veganism Coffee Russian cuisine Sandwich Tofu Salad Kit Kat Cuisine of the Southern United States McDonald's Ice cream Full English breakfast Dim sum Hamster Milk Meal Potato Food preservation Pizza Barbecue Cuisine of Brazil Korean cuisine Tooth Hot dog Fecal incontinence Happy Tree Friends Omega-3 fatty acid Cuisine of Argentina Hamburger Cuisine of Malaysia Tea Potassium Cha chaan teng Roman eating and drinking Tomato Cuisine of Africa Polish cuisine Peanut Wine Fruit Atkins Nutritional Approach Happy Meal Soft drink Ramen Bacon Avocado Healthy eating Cadbury Schweppes Fish and chips Chicken soup Serbian cuisine Fanta Oreo Nutrition Cuisine of Austria Cajun cuisine Butter Bengali cuisine Cold Stone Creamery Food guide pyramid Cheese Chili con carne Mango Last meal Bagel Soup French fries Alcoholic beverage Maple syrup Nabemono Chinese New Year Apple Insulin

is this a good recipe http www tastyandmeatless com edamamegyoza htm does this recipe seem like it will be good because whenever i make recipes a lot of times they would come out weird it sounds good to me maybe you are using ingredients you don't really like the flavor of sometimes not everyone likes shitaake mushrooms or truffles maybe exchange some of the ingredients for things more appealing to you portabello or white mushrooms for example also be sure to follow directions exactly the first time you make something new after you've tasted how it's supposed to be it's easier to make changes to suit yourself  Vegetarian cuisine Truffle Ketchup Recipe Rum Miso soup Japanese cuisine Chocolate French cuisine Apple pie Bread Curry Ramen Idli Pizza Russian cuisine Mayonnaise Mooncake Cantonese cuisine Iron Chef Cuisine of Denmark Polish cuisine Milkshake Pasta Risotto Potato Italian cuisine Edible mushroom Mushroom Sushi Gelato Mai Tai Chili con carne Soup Food Hamburger Gumbo Domain Name System Cocktail Cajun cuisine Roman eating and drinking Potato chips Barbecue Button mushroom Cooking Cuisine of Brazil Cuisine of Vietnam Soy sauce Martini cocktail Tofu HyperText Transfer Protocol Cheese Vegetarianism Cheesecake Pecan pie Meatball Ice cream Cuisine of Thailand Cooking weights and measures Minestrone Mushroom hunting Bacon Full English breakfast Rice congee Alice B.

tahiniiiiiiiiiii i love tahini but i am all out i live in a small town and stores around here i e walmart don't sell it so i am outta luck i've been thinking about making my own and i was wondering if it would turn out the same i know that they do some weird kernel separating filtering strange process thing to make tahini but i read online that you could make it by toasting sesame seeds then blending them with olive oil is this so does it taste the same also in the spirit of tahini i was wondering if anyone else adds a tsp of sugar to their hummus that's my cookbook's secret ingredient mmm i might try adding tomatoes to my hummus i add lots of lemon mm i think i'm going to pass on your recommendation of garlic ehckekkekk imo it does not belong there my friend i can't buy things online thanks poodiesgirl i will take your word for it i'm going to try to make some tomorrow thanks poodiesgirl i will take your word for it i'm going to try to make some tomorrow oopsssssss haha scocasso we are the most middle eastern people in town and we can't find the tahini you can definitely make it yourself i've done it before you will need a really fine grinder or wet grinder think of the coffee grinder variety since you only need about tablespoons of tahini to make hummus put that into consideration when you are roasting your seasame seeds all you need to do is dry roast your seeds no kernel seperating needed and then allow them to cool then grind them down into powder and very slowly add olive oil under you get a thick paste so simple and yes it tastes the same i've never tried sugar but i've done a pinch of basil and oh yeah lemon has to be there  Hummus Coffee Cuisine of Greece Chili con carne Chocolate Halva Idli Mayonnaise Tea Peruvian cuisine Cuisine of Turkey Tofu Espresso Curry Brewery Bread Breakfast Bagel Jewish cuisine Rum Soy protein Flax Barbecue Bengali cuisine Beer Cuisine of the Philippines Russian cuisine Baba ganoush Ketchup Pasta Pizza Culture of Turkey Cantonese cuisine Coriander Sushi Cuisine of Brazil Hamster Cajun cuisine D__ner kebab Olive oil Garlic Sake Tobacco Milk Thermal power station Cuisine of Africa Hamburger Cooking weights and measures Cheese Cuisine of Singapore Cuisine of Denmark Chicken soup Turkish coffee Hemp Cuisine of Malaysia French fries Vegetarian cuisine Singlish Cocoa Yerba mate Ice cream Peanut Korean cuisine Textile manufacturing Wine making Roast beef Cannabis (drug) Muesli Sugar RuneScape quests Instant coffee Sugar beet Sugarcane Barley Essential oil Dim sum Mango Casting Recipe Carbon dioxide Paint Oregano Compost French cuisine Glass Dosa Cuisine of Argentina Date Palm

i am a newby vegan i am also overweight lbs and ' but i do carry a lot of muscle because of my job so i don't look as heavy as i am will i lose weight i will stay true to my animal friends regardless but what has been your experience from what i've seen others experience diet alone will not be very affective it will likely work but very slowly unless you go on a fast or drastic reduced diet etc not a good idea that will ruin your already poor metabolism i have seen some huge people go healthy vegan but it took them a long long time to finally slim down to a more natural level of body fat but on the other hand i being a bicycle racer and etc know of some huge people who took up bicycle racing literally their fat just melted away in a year they were unrecognizable from when i first met them being so well normal looking they looked like a bicycle racer see diet does not really make you thin very affectively it is your metabolism that really determines whether or not your food get stored or gets put into your system waiting for you to do exercise if you train your body to expect that you will do exercise it will not be stored as fat doing bicycle racing for so many years when i eat i literally get so hot i usually have to take my shirt off my food simply goes to energy because my metabolism is very high you can be thin and on a bad diet if you do enough exercise but your health and performance will be better on a quality diet once you start intensive exercise and i mean trying as hard as you can going for the gold so to speak the fat storage will melt away exponentially it will start slow but gather speed as it goes along like a ball going down a hill your arteries will open up blood will flow faster they they will open faster and faster exponentially as the flow increases with this your performance will improve and you will go faster and further each time you head out to train vegan is the way to go i became one for athletics but i am the exact same weight after my diet change as before because i had already been bicycle racing for many years beforehand intensive exercise will force your body to it's optimum settings you will gain muscle but lose fat you will get to a point where you are actually gaining weight because muscle weight much more than fat but throw away the scale and just look in the mirror it's not about weight it's about health metabolism quality food less stress natural body fat levels etc etc obviously i'm an advocate for intensive exercise one more example every day on my way to school i crossed the track field there were these very fat women who where there every day walking at a quick pace around and around the track years went by and i never saw a difference in their body shape why because they always went at the same pace they never went as hard and as fast as they could never pushed themselves to their mental and physical limits if you would like to look like a slim trim buff athlete for example then become an athlete make goals join a racing club everyone will cheer you on you will likely be dead last at first but not for long hope what i said puts some spurs into ya and offers some encouragement  Obesity Equine conformation Anorexia nervosa Insulin Hypoglycemia Swimming Bodybuilding Super Size Me Tocopherol Diabetes mellitus Chronic fatigue syndrome Veganism Low-carbohydrate diet Nutrition Triathlon Urinary incontinence Tai Chi Chuan Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Bicycle Marathon (sport) Drag racing Binge eating disorder Coronary heart disease Cancer Vitamin C Protein Chocolate Internal ballistics Vegetarianism Jet engine Stroke Growth hormone treatment Puberty Fast bowling Thermoregulation Milk Recumbent bicycle Folic acid Raw food diet Redundant array of independent disks Natural Selection (computer game) Trans fat Body mass index Osteoarthritis Electrophysiology Bicycle frame Chinese martial arts Weight loss Sugar substitute Babe Ruth Swingout Climbing specialist (cycling) RISC Domestic rabbit Explosive material Hamster Aerobic exercise Aikido Fusion power Terminal ballistics Fancy rat Action potential Handloading Poker jargon Inflation Homer Simpson Protein-energy malnutrition Sport rowing Piccolo Junior Saga Eye Personal rapid transit Stuttering Physical attractiveness Clinical depression Fanny Blankers-Koen Food Dairy Growth hormone deficiency Human height Carbon dioxide Team Fortress Classic Hiking Fecal incontinence Garfield

people of all weights and sizes please rate my day shalaallalalala woke up at am am green tea calories banana am cup of low fat soy milk calories and cup of all bran calories am green tea calories pm tomato cup spinach cup romaine lettuce cup applesauce calories pretzels calories tbsp of peanut butter calories workout pm mins jog sit ups mins on elliptical machine pm decaf herbal tea calories biggg mango pear i'm yrs old lbs vegan rate my day tips advice good or bad why thanks oh and pm baby carrots day i would say about a you ate the right foods and made a solid commendable dnno how u spell that effort here are something to improve on in brief and then the reasons for why in brief what you need to improve on super important do work out before anything else that way you will use up your fat source not the food you have eaten during the day the food you have eaten turns into energy which is used when you exercise if you workout before eating anything jsut when you wake up you use the energy straight from your fat source this is absolutly positvely crucial for loosing weight d p s your not even fat most importantly water water water gosh you drank lyk none i would die having no water none of this tea stuff water is just as good for you as you will see later on in my answer have a mael between and reasons why stated below eat a few more fruit where possible a few diet tips and reasons keep metabolism steady eating one small meal such as a potato a salad etc every three hours that you are awake will not speed up your metabolism rather it will keep it going your metabolism goes and slows with your food intake and eating something small every three hours will keep that metabolism burning calories and will help you lose weight so you should of therefore had something at about pm in between lunch and your sort of small dinner snack at pm eat smaller dinners cut down on the size of your dinner if you're hungry snack on fruits or other healthy low calorie snacks large dinners tend to hurt a fat loss process because most people aren't very active after dinner this is the basis for advice along the lines of don't eat anything within x hours before going to bed the claim that your entire dinner is stored as fat isn't entirely true the process is more complicated than that but the fact you don't move after dinner is enough to hurt your cause you can offset this by eating a larger lunch or snacking healthily before dinner you hade a small dinner so grats you did that well fresh fruits or vegetables are excellent choices for curbing appetite not to mention other health benefits you had a pear and a banna and a mango which is good but try have a few more fruit remember plus a day d a handful of nuts might do the same drink a large glass of water before sitting at the table eat more fiber most people don't get enough fiber the recommended amount is actually not that much if you eat a healthy diet fiber foods include whole grains fruits and vegetables and nuts and seeds other options are fiber supplements the harm of skipping breakfast from a weight loss perspective is it makes you eat a huge lunch since your body hasn't had anything in the past or more hours so that said you should have had more for lulnch that just a banana when you eat a huge lunch you get that after meal drowsiness so now you're both unproductive and inactive cereals don't take much time to prepare and consume and most of them are very healthy nowadays if you are extremely pressed for time consider grabbing a box of breakfast bars or a smoothie and throwing one in your bag when you leave for work or school some breakfast bars out there are also excellent sources of fiber eat smaller meals more frequently this helps raise your metabolism too it's not easy to do though since it's a relatively big change to most people's routines but it doesn't have to be a full blown meal simply eat often but less a jar of nuts in the office will do just fine grab a handful when you feel like it most fruits can last for a couple days without refrigeration and if you have a refrigerator at the office make use of it drink more water everyday many places suggest cups l of water a day it sounds like an absurd amount of water but actually you can drink tea without sugar to make up some of the quota in fact tea especially green tea rev up your metabolism actually cause a temporary increase in calories burned for fat loss purposes it is important to remind yourself that thirst is a much weaker stimuli than hunger if you consistantly feel hungry after meals don't immediately think that you need to eat more you may simply be thirsty needless to say there are many benefits of water of your body is made of it we can exist without food for months but without water we can only survive for a few days your body is made up mostly of water which is essential for digestion nutrient absorption and elimination aids circulation helps control the body's temperature lubricates and cushions joints keeps the skin healthy helps remove toxins from your body every day you lose water from the body through urine and sweat and this fluid needs to be replenished however your body has come equipped with a mechanism that tells you when you need to replenish your supply it s called thirst drinking water is good for you it will not make you fat if you drink glasses a day or even just dont drink too much more than that goodluck with it  Potassium Soybean Egg (food) Tomato German cuisine Water Super Size Me Urinary incontinence Soft drink Cuisine of

is it true that you have more energy if you don't eat chicken pork or beef pescatarian a lot of nutritionists think that is the healthiest diet actually some studies claim that a plant based diet that also includes fish was the way early humans ate since fish can be more safely eaten raw than other animals and would be easy to obtain i think you would have more energy on such a diet since heavier foods like red meat tend to make you feel weighed down your heart will thank you at any rate btw i don't think there is any need for the animosity some of the other answerers have shown you either you didn't claim that eating fish makes you a vegetarian and if you want to call yourself a pescaterian what difference does it make a lot of people ask nutrition questions in this section because there a lot of nutritionally educated people who frequent here there is no reason to be hateful to someone who just wanted to ask an honest question  Vegetarianism Veganism Hamburger Omega-3 fatty acid Raw food diet Nutrition Atkins Nutritional Approach Dieting Food Vegetarian nutrition Egg (food) Environmental vegetarianism Cuisine of Malaysia Vitamin C Vegetarianism and religion Taboo food and drink McDonald's Ramen Pork Low-carbohydrate diet Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Meat Clean animals Peruvian cuisine Oily fish Coronary heart disease Healthy eating Animal rights Garfield Livestock Breastfeeding Stomach cancer Vegetarian cuisine Gray Wolf Tofu Natural Hygiene Fancy rat Cat food MRE Food guide pyramid Chinese food therapy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma French cuisine British cuisine Colorectal cancer Milk Whaling Hot pot Soul food Meat analogue Protein Guinea pig Chicken Peter Singer Fish and chips Gelatin Tlingit Cuisine of Vietnam Domesticated turkey Cuisine of the Southern United States Pork rind Pig Bengali cuisine Obesity Halaal Korean cuisine Brain Cuisine of Laos Cat Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Anorexia nervosa Folic acid Barbecue Red meat Trans fat Cuisine of Ethiopia Theory of conduct Taiwanese cuisine Domestic rabbit Breakfast Fruitarianism Cuisine of Singapore Cuisine of Denmark Organic food Dietary supplement Cajun cuisine Super Size Me Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Buddhism Cuisine of the Philippines

vegetarian problems i'm a thirteen year old so i don't really have control over what i can and cannot eat and i have recently like or months ago became vegetarian for many different reasons anyways nobody in my family that i live close to supports me in my choice of being vegetarian my dad and grandpa whom i live with at one house doesn't really care but don't find it very important about what they buy and my mom and aunt who's just laugh at me and say i'm stupid what where can i get the right kind of food there is a japanese analogy proverb that goes like this the nail that sticks up is the one that gets hammered down people are like this everywhere when you tell your family that it is your personal belief that animals should not be eaten they take a look at themselves and it can be subconsciously translated into what you do is wrong and i choose to be right the best advice is to study everything that you can about a healthy vegetarian diet and keep yourself in good shape better than most people your age or than your friends family if possible if nobody that you know shows a genuine positive interest in your choice don't give them the privilege of the knowledge that you have gathered work your way around any attempts they make to trivialize your beliefs and if possible go shopping with your parents and buy things that aren't obvious veggie fare instead of trying to sneak fake meat into the cart toss in lentil soup peanut butter pasta fruits veggies or anything else that you have learned is needed to fill any gaps in your diet if you want to become a lacto ovo vegetarian the transition should be quite simple almost all meats have widely available commercial replacements all that you have to do is replace any flesh in your diet beef pork poultry seafood with meat analogs or just leave it out altogether you should keep in mind that a journey such as this can be quite short but should just be the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this is because of the reality of factory farming in which animals that are kept alive to produce milk eggs etc suffer much more and longer than animals that are raised to a certain weight and then slaughtered http www veganoutreach org whyvegan http meat org some people use the word vegan in reference to this idea but be aware that applying that label to yourself should always come with the inclusion of wise activism and advocacy http www veganoutreach org advocacy index html two extremely important examples of this are that you should never speak to someone about vegetarianism veganism without their consent and genuine interest or as a comment on what they are eating and your dietary beliefs should never be used as an introduction or explanation of who you are as a person veg ism should be something that comes up after people get to know you and they offer you a situation that makes it confusing to withhold the information discussion also if you are presented something that you choose not to eat or you are ordering food eating together somewhere picking the best place to eat a responsible vegan always studies the subject of their own health and how to keep their body completely provided for in every sense http www veganhealth org sh to neglect their body is to define a plant based diet as unhealthy and is the opposite of helping the animals when you you hold off on the subject until it's necessary and then act like it isn't a big deal at all people are usually surprised and way more interested and curious than if you were to bring it up when someone's eating or just using it as a conversation starter just to clear things up the vegetarian vegan diet is not composed of salads vegetables fruit and fake meat fruits and vegetables are always important but they do not make up the largest portion of any healthy diet a balanced plant based diet includes grains breads pasta rice cereal legumes soy beans peas lentils fruit and vegetables http www pcrm org health veginfo vsk food groups html http www peta org accidentallyvegan http www veganoutreach org whyvegan eating html being vegan can be an art one whose challenge is to take things that involve the suffering of the innocent and change them into something free of cruelty a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential technically the term vegetarian does imply that you don't consume anything that comes from the body of an animal that requires killing it many ingredients such as gelatin and glycerin are found in many candies fig newtons and many of other foods as well as rennet found in many cheeses http www happycow net health animal ingredients html the best thing to remember is to take your time so that for example when you are comfortable not eating beef and pork you can then give up chicken when you are sure you can make the commitment permanently depending on your age or reliance on parents or regional options it may not be best to give yourself a label the important thing is to do your best to make progress and be committed to your compassion towards animals never put your focus onto what you or other people use to describe yourself if you meet someone that talks down to people for eating meat dairy etc or to you because they think they are more veg than you laugh in their face and tell them they are a disgrace to the entire philosophy people like this only hurt the idea of veg ism and the animals the point of all of this is to live compassionately and and as free from cruelty as you can all the while maintaining your health and a positive attitude people who don't maintain either need not open their mouths and represent our beliefs if you actually choose to read all of this i hope it helps if not feel free to e mail me if you have questions i'm vegan and these are some of my favorite things to eat breakfast bananas cream of wheat with brown sugar and soy butter cereal pancakes or french toast with real maple syrup vegan sausage patties smoothies lunch vegan sausage sandwiches sandwiches with vegan deli slices tofurkey is the only one that's kinda funky fruit dinner leftovers couscous salad vegan sushi potato or pasta salad dinner sloppy joes sausage and gravy with homemade biscuits spaghetti and trader joe's meatballs or tvp lasagna thai pad see ew pad khi mao drunkard's noodles pad prig king tofu eggplant with basil sauce yellow thai curry with tofu or vegan chikn and veggies and jasmine rice indian dal with homemade roti or dosai channa masala aloo gobi vegetable or minestrone soup pizza steamed pork buns with potstickers or spring rolls sweet sour orange lemon chikn vegan pho or wonton soup i use these sites to find recipes http www foodnetwork com http vegweb com http www

how much do you care about fair trade an earlier question made me wonder if other vegans and vegetarians go out of their way to get fair trade chocolate and coffee if they consider it part of their veg nism to not support human slavery as well or what other products practices you guys know of that contribute to awful human rights violations also interested in hearing responses from non veg people who support the fair trade initiatives i don't give a damn because i know someone in the coffee business as a wholesaler and the told me straight up that fair trade is a scam a total scam and the farmers are not getting very much more money out of it if any at all he does what he calls direct trade direct from the farm in s america to him he directly gives them his money no middlemen see even with fair trade there all sorts of middlemen sure it may be a bit better but not much at all from what i've been told direct trade is what we need to focus on totally completely get rid of the middle men between the farm and the local wholesaler farm to wholesaler to coffee shop the end unless you are a coffee chain then you can be your own wholesaler from the farm to your coffee shops  Veganism Fair trade Chocolate and slavery Local food People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Family farm Theory of conduct Ethical consumerism Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Sweatshop Animal rights Starbucks Slavery Wal-Mart Fairtrade labelling Food Tesco Trade Wall Street Livestock Free trade Simone Weil Organic food History of Brazil (1889-1930) Ribeir__o Preto Farmers' Alliance Illegal drug trade American individualist anarchism Economy of Haiti Coffee Coffeehouse Bulk vending Democratic Party (United States) RuneScape cheats Agriculture in Australia Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Retailer Advance fee fraud Agriculture Economy of the United States Corporation Kashrut Microeconomics Milton H.

i'm and i want to become a vegetarian what do i need to eat fruits veges to stay healthy i don't eat seafood your parents have probably been taught a huge amount of misinformation by their parents and their teachers while growing up you really need to research vegetarian diets and health before you even think about saying the v word in front of your parents when you have gathered enough information and feel confident in a vegetarian diet's ability to maintain or even improve health you may mention to them that you have made the decision they may be shocked angry worried curious or many other things but you must never react to their behavior and always stay calm if they are able to speak to you and respect your choice please tell them everything and answer all questions if they are rude inconsiderate judgmental violent or verbally abusive refuse to continue any conversation until they can speak to you with respect if you want to become a lacto ovo vegetarian the transition should be quite simple almost all meats have widely available commercial replacements all that you have to do is replace any flesh in your diet beef pork poultry seafood with meat analogs or just leave it out altogether you should keep in mind that a journey such as this can be quite short but should just be the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this is because of the reality of factory farming in which animals that are kept alive to produce milk eggs etc suffer much more and longer than animals that are raised to a certain weight and then slaughtered http www veganoutreach org whyvegan http meat org some people use the word vegan in reference to this idea but be aware that applying that label to yourself should always come with the inclusion of wise activism and advocacy http www veganoutreach org advocacy index html two extremely important examples of this are that you should never speak to someone about vegetarianism veganism without their consent and genuine interest or as a comment on what they are eating and your dietary beliefs should never be used as an introduction or explanation of who you are as a person veg ism should be something that comes up after people get to know you and they offer you a situation that makes it confusing to withhold the information discussion also if you are presented something that you choose not to eat or you are ordering food eating together somewhere picking the best place to eat a responsible vegan always studies the subject of their own health and how to keep their body completely provided for in every sense http www veganhealth org sh to neglect their body is to define a plant based diet as unhealthy and is the opposite of helping the animals when you you hold off on the subject until it's necessary and then act like it isn't a big deal at all people are usually surprised and way more interested and curious than if you were to bring it up when someone's eating or just using it as a conversation starter just to clear things up the vegetarian vegan diet is not composed of salads vegetables fruit and fake meat fruits and vegetables are always important but they do not make up the largest portion of any healthy diet a balanced plant based diet includes grains breads pasta rice cereal legumes soy beans peas lentils fruit and vegetables http www pcrm org health veginfo vsk food groups html http www peta org accidentallyvegan http www veganoutreach org whyvegan eating html being vegan can be an art one whose challenge is to take things that involve the suffering of the innocent and change them into something free of cruelty a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential technically the term vegetarian does imply that you don't consume anything that comes from the body of an animal that requires killing it many ingredients such as gelatin and glycerin are found in many candies fig newtons and many of other foods as well as rennet found in many cheeses http www happycow net health animal ingredients html the best thing to remember is to take your time so that for example when you are comfortable not eating beef and pork you can then give up chicken when you are sure you can make the commitment permanently depending on your age or reliance on parents or regional options it may not be best to give yourself a label the important thing is to do your best to make progress and be committed to your compassion towards animals never put your focus onto what you or other people use to describe yourself if you meet someone that talks down to people for eating meat dairy etc or to you because they think they are more veg than you laugh in their face and tell them they are a disgrace to the entire philosophy people like this only hurt the idea of veg ism and the animals the point of all of this is to live compassionately and and as free from cruelty as you can all the while maintaining your health and a positive attitude people who don't maintain either need not open their mouths and represent our beliefs if you actually choose to read all of this i hope it helps if not feel free to e mail me if you have questions i'm vegan and these are some of my favorite things to eat breakfast bananas cream of wheat with brown sugar and soy butter cereal pancakes or french toast with real maple syrup vegan sausage patties smoothies lunch vegan sausage sandwiches sandwiches with vegan deli slices tofurkey is the only one that's kinda funky fruit dinner leftovers couscous salad vegan sushi potato or pasta

is tofu fattening trying to eat less animal products after watching a horrifying documentary but i'm also trying to loose weight so is too much bad for you like on a daily basis also is all tofu created equal i would like to try cooking it with veggies and also adding it to smoothies never tried it though any tips tofu is great when cooked with vegetables and it tastes wonderful in smoothies a ounce serving of tofu has about calories the actual amount varies from one brand or firmness level to the next but i'd say that whatever type you choose it is relatively low in calories while it's possible to eat so much tofu that it makes you gain weight you'd have to eat such a large quantity of it that you'd probably get sick of it before putting on many pounds you can bake broil barbecue or saute the tofu depending on the dish you're preparing it's always a good idea to add plenty of vegetables to make the meal more filling and nutritious tofu doesn't have to be cooked it can be added to a smoothie for a delicious drink just put some soft silken tofu in a blender with an assortment of fruit and liquefy it if it's too thick add some soy milk to thin it out eating any reasonable amount of tofu on a daily basis should be fine by reasonable i mean one or two servings at each meal like up to servings per day not all tofu is created equal there are varying firmnesses depending on what you want to do with it soft for smoothies firm for baking some tofu is organic some is not you can find tofu that has already been seasoned or find it plain you can also find tofu that has already been baked or find it raw just go to the store buy some tofu and try it i bet you'll like it  Hamburger Japanese cuisine Vegetarian cuisine Veganism Korean cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Cuisine of Malaysia Breakfast Barbecue Sushi German cuisine Chocolate Cuisine of Brazil Food Dieting Soybean Soup Vitasoy Cuisine of the Philippines Cuisine of Singapore Vegetarianism Soy milk Milk Dairy Dim sum Pancake McDonald's Mayonnaise Miso Cheese Ice cream French cuisine Nabemono Cantonese cuisine Coffee Japanese tea ceremony Domesticated turkey Bread Soy sauce French fries Taiwanese cuisine Meal Burger Sausage Cha chaan teng Dumpling Peruvian cuisine Cookware and bakeware Atkins Nutritional Approach Rice pudding Recipe Roman eating and drinking Domestic rabbit Breastfeeding Bengali cuisine Potato Shanghai cuisine Chinese cuisine Omega-3 fatty acid Donburi Value added Poker jargon Sauerkraut Organic food Fish and chips Anorexia nervosa Cuisine of the Southern United States Insulin Chili con carne Plantain Cooking In-N-Out Burger Vitamin C Russian cuisine Cuisine of Laos Illegal drug trade Pie MRE Udon Flour Microeconomics Soba Fecal incontinence Sauce Adjustable gastric band Bodybuilding

vegetarian im thinking of becoming one and idk um what products should i buy and how can i stay as healthy as i am now without eating meat id like to stay on the cheap side thanks learning to cook vegetarian food is the only way to keep things cheap you'll actually spend less than the average meat eater if you do it right i'm vegan and these are some of my favorite things to eat breakfast bananas cream of wheat with brown sugar and soy butter cereal pancakes or french toast with real maple syrup vegan sausage patties smoothies lunch vegan sausage sandwiches sandwiches with vegan deli slices tofurkey is the only one that's kinda funky fruit dinner leftovers couscous salad vegan sushi potato or pasta salad dinner sloppy joes sausage and gravy with homemade biscuits spaghetti and trader joe's meatballs or tvp lasagna thai pad see ew pad khi mao drunkard's noodles pad prig king tofu eggplant with basil sauce yellow thai curry with tofu or vegan chikn and veggies and jasmine rice indian dal with homemade roti or dosai channa masala aloo gobi vegetable or minestrone soup pizza steamed pork buns with potstickers or spring rolls sweet sour orange lemon chikn vegan pho or wonton soup i use these sites to find recipes http www foodnetwork com http vegweb com http www recipezaar com if you want to become a lacto ovo vegetarian the transition should be quite simple almost all meats have widely available commercial replacements all that you have to do is replace any flesh in your diet beef pork poultry seafood with meat analogs or just leave it out altogether you should keep in mind that a journey such as this can be quite short but should just be the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this is because of the reality of factory farming in which animals that are kept alive to produce milk eggs etc suffer much more and longer than animals that are raised to a certain weight and then slaughtered http www veganoutreach org whyvegan http meat org some people use the word vegan in reference to this idea but be aware that applying that label to yourself should always come with the inclusion of wise activism and advocacy http www veganoutreach org advocacy index html two extremely important examples of this are that you should never speak to someone about vegetarianism veganism without their consent and genuine interest or as a comment on what they are eating and your dietary beliefs should never be used as an introduction or explanation of who you are as a person veg ism should be something that comes up after people get to know you and they offer you a situation that makes it confusing to withhold the information discussion also if you are presented something that you choose not to eat or you are ordering food eating together somewhere picking the best place to eat a responsible vegan always studies the subject of their own health and how to keep their body completely provided for in every sense http www veganhealth org sh to neglect their body is to define a plant based diet as unhealthy and is the opposite of helping the animals when you you hold off on the subject until it's necessary and then act like it isn't a big deal at all people are usually surprised and way more interested and curious than if you were to bring it up when someone's eating or just using it as a conversation starter just to clear things up the vegetarian vegan diet is not composed of salads vegetables fruit and fake meat fruits and vegetables are always important but they do not make up the largest portion of any healthy diet a balanced plant based diet includes grains breads pasta rice cereal legumes soy beans peas lentils fruit and vegetables http www pcrm org health veginfo vsk food groups html http www peta org accidentallyvegan http www veganoutreach org whyvegan eating html being vegan can be an art one whose challenge is to take things that involve the suffering of the innocent and change them into something free of cruelty a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential technically the term vegetarian does imply that you don't consume anything that comes from the body of an animal that requires killing it many ingredients such as gelatin and glycerin are found in many candies fig newtons and many of other foods as well as rennet found in many cheeses http www happycow net health animal ingredients html the best thing to remember is to take your time so that for example when you are comfortable not eating beef and pork you can then give up chicken when you are sure you can make the commitment permanently depending on your age or reliance on parents or regional options it may not be best to give yourself a label the important thing is to do your best to make progress and be committed to your compassion towards animals never put your focus onto what you or other people use to describe yourself if you meet someone that talks down to people for eating meat dairy etc or to you because they think they are more veg than you laugh in their face and tell them they are a disgrace to the entire philosophy people like this only hurt the idea of veg ism and the animals the point of all of this is to live compassionately and and as free from cruelty as you can all the while maintaining your health and a positive attitude people who don't maintain either need not open their mouths and represent our beliefs if you actually choose to read all of this i hope it helps if not feel free to e mail me if you have questions

anyother one of my many questions ok im asking this because i think if this were to happen i would ok my questin is if a cow was to die of old age would you eat it i would if it died without beging killed would you no unless there was an autopsy performed you really don't know what the cow died from he could've had cancer or something not safe but i do understand what you're saying and the answer is no for me the only way i could see me doing that is if i was deserted with no food but the cow and he was my last option even then i don't know how to create fire without matches so i would probably just starve to death because i sure as heck wouldn't eat him raw  Abstraction (computer science) Milk Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cattle Livestock Glen Jacobs Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Stomach cancer Vegetarianism Escherichia coli O157:H7 Buddhism Growth hormone treatment Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Horse meat Hitler's death Philosophical skepticism RuneScape quests Dairy Kurt Cobain 28 Days Later Anorexia nervosa Diablo II: Lord of Destruction John F.

so why are you a vegetarin honestly if your reasons are because animals should not be killed then its kinda pointless they will be killed and processed anyways and if a few thousand people in the world dont eat them then no big loss they were born to be eaten its the food chain people or do you just not like meat i can understand that but everyone likes meat so it kinda makes me wonder lol or you have another reason i think he gave cows legs so it is easier to milk them lol no clue more or less i did it in spite of my mom real mature i know i decided to give it up for lent and she told me she didn't want me to because i would get sick so i did it and after days of abstaining from meat i just didn't want it i ate it on easter sunday with everyone else but i felt sick and completely appalled and i know where you're coming from i used to believe in the whole if it doesn't moo cluck or go oink i won't eat it but it does make you feel healthier and the choice to become a vegetarian will only affect you positively  Kashrut Vegetarianism Vegetarianism and religion Meat RuneScape quests Dairy Taboo food and drink Chicken Gray Wolf Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kodocha Dieting Buddhist cuisine Lent Fecal incontinence Theory of conduct Egg (food) Cattle The Amazing Race Cheese Joke Meat analogue McDonald's Goat Cat Milk Great Lent Unclean animals Tofu Livestock Escherichia coli O157:H7 Hamburger Foodborne illness Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) The nature of God in Western theology Jewish cuisine Vegetarian cuisine Salad Fingers Poker jargon The Cure Eastern Orthodox Church Environmental vegetarianism Pitaten About a Boy Slaughterhouse Pig Omega-3 fatty acid 613 mitzvot Sausage Fast food Dog Domestic goat Tooth Food Protein American Bison Buddhism Lisa the Vegetarian Time Out of Mind Past teachings of Prem Rawat Brain Deluge (mythology) Palindrome Organic farming Animal rights Cindy Sheehan Kangaroo Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Diarrhea Soybean Horse meat Didache Healthy eating Rich Mullins Tiger Factory farming Nutrition Fish and chips Atkins Nutritional Approach Fiddler on the Roof Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Conker's Bad Fur Day Bigfoot Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 One Piece minor characters Atomic Kitten Fugu Kosher foods Orca Swedish cuisine Breastfeeding Carnival Beef The Adventures of Pete & Pete Eating Vitamin C God Emperor of Dune

suggestions for what i should do i'm vegetarian my family is going to simply fondue for my moms birthday my mom half convinced me into eating chicken i really don't want to eat chicken so when we go there for a meal all they have for entrees is meat should i just eat before we go there or stomach the chicken a slight pinch are you f ing out of your mind i honestly think your answer has had the reverse affect on me peeled turtle i think i'm skipping the chicken actually the cheese is kind of in the appetizer yeah and my grandma is going to be so skeptical and disapproving it will be hard to bear if you don't want to eat the chicken then don't eat it maybe you could call ahead and talk to the manager at the restaurant and explain that you're going there for your mother's birthday and that you're vegetarian and ask if they have a vegetarian entree option that they can make for you if there are vegetarian appetizer options perhaps they can just turn one of those into an entree for you or you could order the appetizer for your entree and supplement it with a green salad etc if you're concerned that it won't be the most complete meal for you since there won't be a good vegetarian protein source then make sure you eat a little extra protein for breakfast and lunch that day to help make up for it as far as your grandmother and other family members go i've found that it helps to simply say something like i've made a personal decision to be vegetarian because of and briefly state your reason concern for animal rights personal health whatever your reason if anyone presses you about it over dinner and you don't want to talk about it because it seems like a hostile situation adn you don't want to cause a fight at your mom's birthday dinner try saying i'd be more than happy to discuss this with any and all of you another time but we're here tonight to celebrate mom's birthday and i don't think that everyone at the table wants to spend the evening talking about my eating habits if you want to talk about this with me then let's pick a time tomorrow next week to sit down and talk about it and i'd be more than happy to answer your questions that way you keep the lines of communication open and avoid overshadowing your mom's dinner  Meal Vegetarianism Cuisine of Denmark French cuisine Veganism McDonald's Dieting Egg (food) Breakfast Food Cheese Hamburger Pizza Stomach cancer Menu Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Korean cuisine Lisa the Vegetarian Prostate cancer Jewish cuisine Sandwich Dinner Kashrut Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Culture of France The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy MRE Tofu Peruvian cuisine Vegetarian cuisine Passover German cuisine Garfield Salad Fingers Hell's Kitchen (television) Chicken Chinese cuisine Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Shaggy dog story Little Britain Theory of conduct Barbecue Fasting Calvin and Hobbes Cuisine of Brazil Rocko's Modern Life Buddhist cuisine Tea (meal) Japanese cuisine Chili con carne Omega-3 fatty acid The Ashlee Simpson Show The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Joke Fiddler on the Roof Cuisine of the Philippines Social rule Recursion Goodness and value theory Fast food The Smoking Room The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Kodocha Public relations Friends Cuisine of the Southern United States Ben Johnson (athlete) Phoebe Buffay's songs Oral sex English grammar Bengali cuisine Aerial (dance move) Milk The nature of God in Western theology Delicatessen Peter Singer Domesticated turkey Satay Chinese New Year Treehouse of Horror V Fecal incontinence Vegetarianism and religion Roman eating and drinking Game show Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an In-N-Out Burger Cuisine of Ethiopia Steak n Shake Birthday French fries

ok but aren't vegetables not grown with manure and fertilizers which come from animals extracts so there is no true vegeterian exactly personally i think all vegetarians are hypocrites they say they're true vegetarians and won't eat animals and etc but yet they wear their skin on their shoes use luggage purses coats and etc you would be surprised at everything that is made from animals that we use every day  Veganism Leather Vegetarianism Vegetarian cuisine Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Cat Compost Vegetarian nutrition Green manure Manure Lisa the Vegetarian Animal rights Dog Christian Vegetarian Association Cheese Buddhist cuisine Tofu Domestic rabbit People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Renewable energy Dieting Meat analogue Soybean Factory farming Biofuel Livestock Organic farming Raw food diet Environmental vegetarianism Osiris Alfalfa Chicken Hemp Vegetarianism and religion Apple Kashrut Cuisine of Brazil Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Oat Common bean Fertilizer Elephant Ayyavazhi religious practices Frog Guinea pig Sunlight Carnivore Food Hamburger Sausage Gelatin Soup Fecal incontinence Punk ideology Feces Didache Tooth Fasting Manna Cat food Peach Unclean animals Weed control Fruitarianism Clothing Yam Egg (food) Hides Green Revolution French cuisine Meat Soils retrogression and degradation Dim sum High-heeled shoe 613 mitzvot Buddhism Nutrition Chinese cuisine Ketchup The Computer Wore Menace Shoes Korean cuisine Fur Banana Phoebe Buffay Economic vegetarianism Cuisine of Ethiopia British cuisine Animal Olive Local food Arracacha Fancy rat Food guide pyramid Hiking Horseshoe Crocodilia In vitro meat Mario

how can a carnivore namely a human one be a vegetarian humans are physiologically vegetarians we are part of the order primates ever seen a monkey eating meat that are essentially vegetarians the canine teeth are not for eating meat but tough roots see dentition of an ape as we evolved into hominid form the during the ice ages lack of plants forced prehistoric hominids to become hunters but the physiology did not change fast enough and vegetarian supplements were always a part of diet archaeologically the race evolved from nomadic to pastorals to agriculturalists a process of evolution back to the diet that suited the physiology my opinion eating meat is like sticking to a primitive unhealthy tradition and refusing to evolve to a vegetarian diet  Vegetarianism Primate Stone Age Tooth Bigfoot Raw food diet Kashrut Veganism Dog Carnivore Olduwan Human Ape Taboo food and drink Human evolution Meat Cat Domestication Brain Dentition Sociocultural evolution Vegetarianism and religion Cat food Environmental vegetarianism Coronary heart disease Carnivorous plant Animal rights Aquatic ape hypothesis Livestock Pork Australopithecus afarensis Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Dieting Cheese Tooth enamel Neolithic Revolution Food Vegetarian nutrition Ecology Carnivora Anthropology The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Peter Singer Evolution Evidence of evolution Vegetarian cuisine Bird Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Crocodilia Protein Hindu Pliocene Atkins Nutritional Approach Vitamin C Cuisine of Africa Tofu Hot dog Hominidae Hunter-gatherer Indigenous Australians Kinkajou Orrorin tugenensis Monkey Christian vegetarianism Homo habilis Soybean Omega-3 fatty acid Strepsirrhini Buddhist cuisine McDonald's Eating Nutrition Tetrapod Cuisine of the Southern United States Low-carbohydrate diet History of Africa Anarcho-primitivism Whale Mammal History of medicine Australopithecine Frugivore Prehistoric music Fruitarianism Neanderthal Cradle of Humanity Ayurveda Natural Hygiene People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Meat analogue Sharia Buddhism Common Chimpanzee Tasmanian Devil Fasting Mountain Gorilla Elephant The Time Machine

my year old daughter wants to be a vegetarian anyone have any tips recipes advice thank you since she is still growing just make sure that she eats well don't allow her to use her vegetarianism to get out of eating her fruit veggies and beans some new vegetarians are tempted to load up on pasta grilled cheese sandwiches cheese pizza junk food or pb j and that is not good she can still eat what everyone else eats just minus the meat taco nights are easy meals for veggies chinese food is also a quick way to get the veggies on the table w o the meat just be sure to use brown rice there are loads of vegetarian soups and sandwiches that can be made as well for lunch time there are many meat substitutes that you can buy in case she starts to feel left out when having spaghetti and meatballs for example the brands you want to look for are boca morningstar farms and gardenburger they are available in many major grocery stores in the frozen food aisle there are also a variety of meatless products in or near the health food or organic section in your store kudos to you mom for assisting her with this decision this forum is totally loaded with sons and daughters struggling with their parents who do not support their vegetarian decision it's great to see a parent actually involved in a positive way for a change my biggest piece of advice is to stick by her even if you think this might be a phase or a short lived expirament it will mean the world to her to have adult support i also ask that you go to bat for her if she is being picked on or belittled by friends neighbors or other family members once they see you supporting her no matter what they will probably stop giving her grief good luck  Hamburger Vegetarian cuisine MRE Japanese cuisine Tofu Breakfast Vegetarianism Food Cuisine of Denmark French cuisine Sandwich Cheese Hot dog Chinese cuisine Korean cuisine Cuisine of Brazil Veganism British cuisine Pizza German cuisine Burger King Pasta Fast-food restaurant Barbecue Cajun cuisine Cha chaan teng Snack food Cuisine of the Philippines Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Dim sum Atkins Nutritional Approach Jewish cuisine Meat analogue Burger Chili con carne Street food Taboo food and drink Cuisine of Malaysia Soup Lisa the Vegetarian In-N-Out Burger Cuisine of Argentina Dumpling D__ner kebab Chopsticks Organic food Potato Fecal incontinence Food guide pyramid Swedish cuisine Cuisine of Singapore Peruvian cuisine Food preservation Cuisine of Norway Peanut butter American Chinese cuisine Ice cream Soy protein Minestrone Bread Russian cuisine Kashrut Kebab French fries Sausage Milk Cincinnati chili Raw food diet Mexican cuisine Kosher foods Peanut Domesticated turkey Meal Taiwanese cuisine Bengali cuisine Delicatessen Bagel Nutrition Brunch Mochi The Adventures of Pete & Pete Cuisine of Africa Asiago cheese Dairy Chocolate Egg (food) 613 mitzvot Serbian cuisine Tamale Vegetarianism and religion

vegetarian vegan i was a vegetarian for over a year and i have just recently became a vegan the diet change is the easy part but i'm and i love to shop i don't really know of any vegan clothing stores and i was wondering if i could still shop at my favorite stores american eagle aeropostale hollister abercrombie and fitch victoria's secret ect any other stores you can think of would be great thanks in advance oh as most said shop where you want and just don't buy things with leather wool silk etc this isn't directly part of your question but anyway i've had huge problems finding vegan shoes in stores and can't really afford to order online so if you have the same problem when it comes to shoes just buy whatever shoes you can that will last the world wasn't meant for vegans yet so shoes are still an issue don't worry yourself over it as long as you try to be to as cruelty free as possible that should be what counts  Veganism Animal rights Abercrombie & Fitch Co.

if i am on diet how do i eat as a vegetarian the mcdougall diet is a sure bet for weight loss the mcdougall program is a vegan diet with an emphasis on low fat whole foods the basic rules are that you are allowed all the vegetables beans and whole unprocessed grains that you need to satisfy your hunger but it is recommended that green and yellow veggies make up at least a third of your diet you are limited to two fruit servings a day you are to eat no flour products and to avoid oil and fatty foods such as olives and avocados like the plague refined soy products are not permitted sugar and salt are allowed in small amounts on the surface of your foods but you are to refrain from cooking with them it sounds very strict but you can cheat a little and still see a good amount of weight loss i have a friend who did this and she refused to give up soy milk and parmesan but still managed to lose lbs in a month  Veganism Vegetarianism Atkins Nutritional Approach Dieting Tofu Cheese Vegetarian cuisine Soybean Omega-3 fatty acid South Beach diet Food guide pyramid Low-carbohydrate diet Vegetarian nutrition Soy milk Nutrition Ramen Raw food diet Japanese cuisine Cuisine of Malaysia Soul food Healthy eating Peruvian cuisine Coronary heart disease Paleolithic diet Folic acid Cuisine of Africa Egg (food) Chocolate Pancake Breastfeeding Soy protein Soy sauce Milk Korean cuisine Fasting Pizza Ice cream Vegetarianism and religion Coeliac disease Hamburger Kashrut Trans fat Cuisine of Singapore Avocado Buddhist cuisine Cantonese cuisine Margarine Taiwanese cuisine Fruitarianism Obesity MRE Olive oil Cuisine of Denmark Cuisine of the Southern United States Bodybuilding Hamster French cuisine Cooking oil Environmental vegetarianism Coffee Chili con carne Soup Russian cuisine Bread Alcoholic beverage Macrobiotic diet MyPyramid Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Bengali cuisine Sushi Fermentation Tocopherol Fancy rat Weight training Pasta Hypoglycemia Mayonnaise Cereal Sauce Crohn's disease Tooth Common bean Sauerkraut Famine Plantain Ketchup German cuisine

vegetarians does tis bug you i drives me crazy when i tell ppl i dont eat meat then they go into this whole thing about how i should b c god put the animals here us eat but nowhere in the bible does it say you have to eat meat it gets on my nerves so bad i would understand if you lived in a poor country and had no other choice but meat but there are other ways to get protein other than meat anyway i dont eat meat b c of my own reasons and ppl should not b c i want to go against god i am a christian i just think ppl should not say that every time the herar i dont eat meat well the bible also says not to wear more than one kind of fabric at once but i'm sure those same people who are preaching the bible are wearing more than one kind of fabric the bible also says that plants existed before there was a sun to drive their photosynthetic process also the bible is not the only religious text in the world most religions pick and choose what to believe from their texts in any one religion there is a wide range of interpretations i mean you'd think there'd be one specific belief set in stone but no that's not how it is so i think any belief has just as much chance of being right or wrong as the million of other beliefs in the world that's why i personally don't take part in any specific religion and find it silly to bring religion into every single little thing from politics right down to what we eat now if you want to delve into the other interpretation of the bible everything in the garden of eden was vegetarian they were told not to eat from the tree of life and they did and that was a sin not an apple please i eat apples every day anyway the bible also states that one day the lion will once again lay down with the lamb it's kind of sad to not take into consideration that just maybe god put us all here to evolve and learn and grow humans and non humans that we all have a soul but circumstancially were born into differnt bodies quoting jesus from the essene gospels of peace 'thou shalt not kill ' for life is given to all by god and that which god has given let not man take away for i tell you truly from one mother proceeds all that lives upon the earth therefore he who kills kills his brother and from him will the earthly mother turn away and will pluck from him her quickening breasts and he will be shunned by her angels and satan will have his dwelling in his body and the flesh of slain beasts in his body will become his own tomb for i tell you truly he who kills kills himself and whoso eats the flesh of slain beasts eats of the body of death for in his blood every drop of their blood turns to poison in his breath their breath to stink in his flesh their flesh to boils in his bones their bones to chalk in his bowels their bowels t o decay in his eyes their eyes to scales in his ears their ears to waxy issue and their death will become his death kill not neither eat the flesh of your innocent prey lest you become the slaves of satan for that is the path of sufferings and it leads unto death but do the will of god that his angels may serve you on the way of life obey therefore the words of god 'behold i have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat and to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the air and to everything that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is breath of life i give every green herb for meat  Ten Commandments Soul 613 mitzvot Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Resurrection of Jesus Genesis Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Religion Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Satan Book of Isaiah Jehovah's Witnesses A Course In Miracles Trinity Kashrut Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Angel Christianity and anti-Semitism Aztec Baptism Christian views of Jesus Mortification of the flesh Unclean animals Buddhism End times Christianity Christian anarchism Abrahamic religion Sola fide Hell Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Grimke Sisters Origin belief Simone Weil Church of Christ Mary, the mother of Jesus God Jesus Meaning of life Isa Holy Spirit John Howard Yoder Judaism Evil Day-Age Creationism Mormonism and Judaism Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Salvation Blood (computer game) Immortality Sacrifice Prophet Paradise Lost Religious perspectives on Jesus Capital punishment Gospel of Barnabas God and gender Devil Chicken Sabbath Heaven Urantia Kosher foods Alan Campbell (pastor) Virgin Mary in Islam Religion and abortion The Amber Spyglass Antichrist Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Noahide Laws Paul of Tarsus Philo Idolatry Fasting Joseph of Arimathea Human nature Book of Mormon Book of Revelation Animism Eucharist Creationism Fundamentalism Korban Curse and mark of Cain

is there a way to get omega fish oil without hurting fish unfortunately not the bodies of the fish need to be processed in order to extract the oil the good news is you can get the beneficial omega fatty acids from other sources as well flaxseed canola oil and walnuts are sources but you have to consume quite a bit because the body doesn't metabolize them very well algae is also a good source though it sounds a bit gross crypthecodinium cohnil and schizochytrium are two strains of algae used as a source for supplemental omega s they are typically grown in fermenters under controlled conditions the algae are dried and the oil extracted for use in supplements omega fats from algae are classified as generally recognized as safe by the fda and can be used to fortify foods  Omega-3 fatty acid Veganism Coronary heart disease Trans fat Biodiesel Oily fish Flax Vegetarian nutrition Milk Sewage treatment Nutrient Vegetarianism Nutrition Chlorophyta Fatty acid Bipolar disorder Folic acid Antioxidant Vitamin Tofu Tocopherol Fat Gamma-linolenic acid Fish oil Carbon dioxide Breastfeeding Fermentation Vitamin D Atkins Nutritional Approach Alcoholic beverage Food and Drug Administration Linseed oil Cell (biology) Food preservation Beer Vitamin C Alcohol fuel Cheese Docosahexaenoic acid Protein Rapeseed Soybean Insulin Renewable energy Shark Egg (food) Sugar Cannabis (drug) Lake Cyanocobalamin Bacteria Citric acid Atherosclerosis Genetically modified food Biofuel Baldness treatments Fishing Dieting Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Basic taste Algae Energy development Dietary supplement Healthy eating Acid Citric acid cycle Perfume Triglyceride Soul food Chocolate Guinea pig Aspartame Hypoglycemia Protein-energy malnutrition Alzheimer's disease Antiretroviral drug Metabolism Sugar substitute Polychlorinated biphenyl Acne Water Water purification Saturated fat Gelatin Clinical depression Raw milk Agriculture First aid Biotin Botany Weight training Bread Food coloring Future energy development Eutrophication

any tips for becoming and staying a vegetarian and does being a vegetarian help you lose weight how much i want to become a vegetarian but im not sure i will stay one i also heard that you can lose weight how much i've been a vegetarian not vegan for years now my original reason motivated me to do it but my reasons for staying a vegetarian have compounded and changed over the years you should ask yourself why you want to become a vegetarian health animal rights weight loss mad cow disease you should also ask yourself how important your reason is to you if it's important enough staying a vegetarian will not be hard at all while being vegetarian can help you to loose weight it is my firm belief that if you eat more calories than you burn whether vegatable calories or animal calories you will not loose weight after all horses are vegetarian vegan and they can get fat too i've packed on about lbs over the years myself due to not getting as much activity as i could be vegetables and whole grains have fiber and fiber doesn't have any calories but it helps you to feel full and to feel full for a while since it takes time to digest fat also has the same priciple but it has lots of calories meat tends to have a lot more fat than fruits and veggies you may want to try starting small by eliminating meat products from your diet slowly for example cut out red meat especially mcdonalds then move on to seafood pork and eventually chicken also try different vegetarian meat substitutes like morning star farms grillers recipe crumbles fake ground beef or morning star farms fake bacon both of these are in the frozen food section of most grocery stores and i live off of them trader joes has a really good selection and so does winco at good prices too in my experience over the years not all of the meat substitutes out there taste good some of them are just awful but there are also a lot of good ones i'm going to give you a list of my favorites below hopefully this will help you out if being vegetarian doesn't satisfy your taste buds your not likely to stick with it morning star farms grillers crumbles these make great taco meat when seasoned with standard taco seasoning grillers burger patties veggie bacon veggie sausage chick patties these are one of my favs chick nuggets so yummy buffalo wings ditto annies frozen anything enchiladas pot pies smart balance margarine spread no trans fats and they even have a light version both are delicious rice dream vanilla rice milk original is too plain so go with vanilla for cereal and stuff soy delicious soy ice cream good luck  Dieting Milk Breakfast Chicken Egg (food) German cuisine Cajun cuisine Pizza Ice cream Atkins Nutritional Approach Chocolate Cuisine of the Philippines Soul food Soy milk In-N-Out Burger Barbecue Domesticated turkey Cheese Kashrut Ramen Soybean Bengali cuisine Peruvian cuisine French cuisine Cuisine of Brazil Soy protein Chili con carne Cantonese cuisine Low-carbohydrate diet Cuisine of Malaysia South Beach diet Burger Cuisine of the Southern United States Food guide pyramid Burger King Cuisine of Singapore Guinea pig Roman eating and drinking Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Kosher foods Buddhist cuisine Coffee Hot dog Factory farming Taiwanese cuisine Raw food diet Nutrition Fish and chips Livestock Margarine Dim sum Dietary fiber Jewish cuisine Omega-3 fatty acid Sausage Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Vegetarianism and religion Animal rights Dairy Environmental vegetarianism Brain Fecal incontinence Breastfeeding British cuisine Prostate cancer Vegetarian nutrition Food preservation Meat French fries Healthy eating Trans fat Sandwich Organic food Breakfast cereal Anorexia nervosa Fast-food restaurant Recipe Fasting Mexican cuisine Cat Bodybuilding

why is there no cheese used in chinese food the other statements listed not in the recipes they're lactose intolerant etc are true but the cause of there not being cheese and of them not gaining lactose tolerancy in traditional chinese dishes is that the domestication of cows for milk to make the cheese in china is a fairly recent development there are no milk products in traditional japanese cuisine or that of many other cultures either crab rangoons and several other chinese dishes are american inventions not traditional chinese  Lactose intolerance Cheese Milk Tofu Japanese cuisine American Chinese cuisine Chinese cuisine Vegetarian cuisine Vegetarianism Ice cream Hamburger Veganism French cuisine Dairy Soup Dairy product Cuisine of Singapore Cajun cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Bengali cuisine Pancake Cuisine of Brazil Food Ramen Persian cuisine Kosher foods Cuisine of Africa Kashrut Canadian Chinese cuisine Butter Kraft Dinner Pasta Irish cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Chinatown D__ner kebab Culture of China Polish cuisine Buddhist cuisine British cuisine Mexican cuisine Curry French fries Jersey Dumpling German cuisine Biscuit Cantonese cuisine Culture of Korea Cuisine of Finland Taboo food and drink Porridge Pizza Cuisine of Austria Cuisine of Norway Peruvian cuisine Republic of China Cuisine of Canada Soy sauce Satay Bread Cuisine of Turkey Gorgonzola cheese Cuisine of Argentina Korea Raw milk Potato chips Myanmar Domestic sheep Pasteurization Cuisine Korean cuisine Cuisine of Hong Kong Meat analogue Fondue Glutinous rice Cuisine of Malaysia Street food M__m__lig__ Rice Coconut milk Kelantan Lac operon Sandwich Paneer Cuisine of the United States Simplified Chinese character Tea Ginger Soul food Swedish cuisine Breast milk Basic taste Cuisine of Vietnam Agriculture Vegetarianism and religion Crohn's disease

are blue corn tortilla chips any healthier or unhealthier than the standard white yellow kind are blue corn or red corn any healthier than the standard yellow white variety i did buy organic if that helps though this is not officially a vegan veggie question i am a vegetarian i figured you guys would know i didn't have time to compare labels at the store not sure if they would have told me anything anyways as far as the 'basic' nutrients go the blue and red corn are fairly similar to yellow and white corn but there are minor differences the pigments in the darker corns have the same benefits normally applied to dark colored fruits and vegetables for what that's worth g the most important ingredient to look for on a corn chip bag is lime calcium hydroxide since that makes a huge difference in making corn nutrients available for use by your body  Vegetarianism Veganism Organic food Maize Color Food Tortilla Bread Hot dog Kashrut Hamster Potato Omega-3 fatty acid E number Soil pH Rum Cell (biology) Color blindness Common bean Peruvian cuisine Calcium hydroxide Milk Color theory Flour Folic acid Garnet Pizza Light-emitting diode In-N-Out Burger Melanin Sodium hydroxide Organic farming Compost Vegetarian nutrition Cuisine of Denmark Fancy rat Human skin color Beer Hamburger Nutrient Blue Dog Drosophila melanogaster Gatorade Dieting Cuisine of Brazil Peanut Calcium Food preservation Raw food diet Nutrition Peach Chocolate Sugar Cajun cuisine Kit Kat Cereal Potassium Phosphorus Curry Japanese cuisine Sandwich Phytochemical Yellow Potato chips Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Pigment Ketchup Commodity markets Ice cream Prostate cancer Chili con carne Soybean Iris (anatomy) Cannabis cultivation Egg (food) CPU cache Tomato Cheese Genetically modified food Cochineal Union Pacific Railroad Barbecue Mexican cuisine Lutein Fertilizer Coffee Color space Sugar beet Cuisine of the Southern United States Nintendo 64 Tocopherol Color temperature Fish and chips Atari 8-bit family Chlorophyta Cuisine of Malaysia Vitamin C

i am having a problem with cravings and being vegan i know that animals are tortured and murdered for the meat eaters' pleasure and i know that there are hundreds if not thousands of chemicals in meat and dairy but i am getting cravings for meat and dairy again i have only been vegan for weeks am i just going to have to watch a peta video everytime i start to crave a mcdonald's snack wrap i know it sounds like i'm being a smart alec but i'm not i have really been struggling the last couple of days and i was wondering if any of you had had this problem thank you soo much for your help huuugs i have been a vegan for about months and i can honestly say that i have not given into any cravings it's more than likely that i have unknowingly eaten some nonvegan and perhaps nonvegetarian foods but i've made every attempt to avoid those the first thing i would suggest is to watch supersize me it's a documentary on fast food that will really gross you out there are very few fast food joints i will go to and when i do it's not often at all secondly f the above movie doesn't convince you to stop eating fast food i highly suggest is to watch earthlings if you haven't already it is adocumentary narrated by joaquin phoenix that explains how much humans rely on animals for food entertainment science and clothing it totally changed my life because it pretty much convinced me to convert to veganism i wasn't vegetarian before i was a full on omnivore once you understand how much of an impact your diet has on the world it's hard not to change thirdly like others have said there are tons of alternatives to meat and dairy if you have a whole foods or outpost near you that will be much easier for you i depend heavily on the meat alternatives boca obviously makes boca burgers but if you're used to eating real hamburgers make sure you have lettuce tomato and other condiments that way they test better and of course get the extra veggies boca also makes chicken nuggets which are really good morningstar makes what i think are called meal starters they have ground beef steak strips and chicken strips i use the ground beef in tons of recipes gardenburger also makes vegetarian and vegan burgers make sure to look at the box veggie crumbles ground beef and my favorite bbq riblets oh they're so yummy tofu is also a great addition to a vegan diet if you haven't started eating that it's cheap about a block high in protein and low in fat as are all veggie protein substitutes it tastes bland by itself but will take on the flavor of whatever marinade or sauce you use i definitely suggest the firm or extra firm varieties dairy substitutes are pretty easy at least for me to come by i've successfully found vegan ice cream soy decadent makes peanut butter zig zag which is to die for cream cheese sour cream tofutti brand and mayo nayonaise and veganaise they do make vegan cheese too but i only use it on homemade pizza so as you can see tons of alternatives to meat and dairy finally becoming a vegan is a huge change i've been given a hard time about it but i think my family and friends are finally beginning to understand how important this is to me just remember that a vegan diet is a diet of compassion good luck to you  Sandwich Burger In-N-Out Burger People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Egg (food) Korean cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Fish and chips Dairy Milk Chili con carne Peruvian cuisine French cuisine Breakfast French fries Dieting D__ner kebab Animal rights Kashrut Bengali cuisine Fast-food restaurant British cuisine Curry Ramen Burger King Cuisine of Malaysia German cuisine Soul food Ice cream Cajun cuisine Bread Soy milk Snack food Chocolate Livestock Soy protein Pancake Raw food diet Cuisine of the Southern United States Jewish cuisine Domesticated turkey Butter Cat Chicken Buddhist cuisine Cantonese cuisine Atkins Nutritional Approach Cuisine of Argentina Seitan Organic food Cha chaan teng Sausage Cuisine of Africa Vegetarian nutrition Garfield Mayonnaise Taiwanese cuisine Peanut butter Cuisine of Singapore Peter Singer Kebab Fecal incontinence Fancy rat Horse meat A&W Restaurants Environmental vegetarianism Bagel Dim sum Soup Margarine Crohn's disease Factory farming Cuisine of Norway Kosher foods Chicken soup FoxTrot Coronary heart disease Oreo Street food Cuisine of Thailand

peaches and avocados how do i make peaches and avocados become softer and riper i have heard about wrapping them with sum stuff any suggestions to speed up the ripening process in peaches place them in a loosely sealed brown paper bag on the counter the peaches give off ethylene gas a natural ripening hormone which is trapped inside the bag causing the fruit to ripen faster you can do this with a plastic bag too but the plastic doesn't breathe as well as the paper meaning moisture may collect causing your perfectly ripened peaches to rot once ripe peaches should be refrigerated and used within a few days although they'll taste better at room temp ripe peaches have a sweet fragrance are soft but not mushy to the touch and have a golden undertone this ripening trick also works for apricots nectarines avocados bananas kiwi mangoes pears and plums  Peach Avocado Fruit Banana Apricot Food preservation Tomato Fanta Fruit tree propagation Fecal incontinence Tofu Ethylene Hamster Plum Sapodilla Jute Bong Wine Tobacco Drupe Kiwifruit Cheese Plastic Plantain Ice cream Snapple Polyethylene terephthalate Cherimoya Ethylene glycol Wine making Genericized trademark Poway, California Milk Ketchup Date Palm Glutinous rice Bubble Bobble Plastic bag Luther Burbank Chutney Coffee Rosaceae Cuisine of the Southern United States Tea Prunus Upholstery Yoplait Butter Mattress Ume Decomposition Black pepper Professional wrestling holds Cuisine of Denmark Peruvian cuisine Glycerin Rebreather Vanilla Bagel Cannabis cultivation Textile manufacturing Wario Sushi Cider The Rutles Jelly Belly Princess Peach Pear Ammonia Gatorade Cherry Stratification (botany) Food storage Vermicompost Ester Rum Tree Dumpling Papaya Street food Cuisine of Brazil Kitchen Chinese calendar Almond Potassium Mushroom hunting Diving regulator Gramophone record Organic food Ben Johnson (athlete) Thermal power station Dietary fiber Barbecue Orchard

parents can't accept me being vegetarian recently i've decided to become vegeratian not only because i pity animals but because the idea of having dead fleash of a once living thing in my mouth disgusts me i've never really liked meat but i ate sausages and burgers to please my parents though refused to eat steak chicken or any meat in the form of meat itself now i've decided to stop eating meat completely because why eat something that i don't like however my parents are having a hard time accepting this i really cant stand the comments that they make over the food i try to eat and the sarcastic jokes that they are making out of me they say that i've ruined my life and it's just a trail to sickness my mum kind of accepted what i'm doing now but my dad is just being horrible to me at mealtimes since he even said that i'm making myself disabeled why can't they just accept the thing that i don't like meat instead of their constant you're just being stupid talks how can i change this i'm there have been vegan olympic gold medalists and a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential http en wikipedia org wiki carl lewis http www eatright org cps rde

to you and respect your choice please tell them everything and answer all questions if they are rude inconsiderate judgmental violent or verbally abusive refuse to continue any conversation until they can speak to you with respect the best advice is to study everything that you can about a healthy vegetarian diet and keep yourself in good shape better than most people your age or than your friends family if possible if nobody that you know shows a genuine positive interest in your choice don't give them the privilege of the knowledge that you have gathered work your way around any attempts they make to trivialize your beliefs and if possible go shopping with your parents and buy things that aren't obvious veggie fare instead of trying to sneak fake meat into the cart toss in lentil soup peanut butter pasta fruits veggies or anything else that you have learned is needed to fill any gaps in your diet if you want to become a lacto ovo vegetarian the transition should be quite simple almost all meats have widely available commercial replacements all that you have to do is replace any flesh in your diet beef pork poultry seafood with meat analogs or just leave it out altogether you should keep in mind that a journey such as this can be quite short but should just be the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this is because of the reality of

someone is rude or makes fun of you for being veg which is very likely to happen at some point laugh do it with a smile when they say something stupid just laugh don't do it at them or even in their general direction completely ignore them with your body language but make sure they are aware that you think what they are saying is funny if they call on the phone and say something about it laugh i don't know what is wrong with some people but if you act like a happy person that is confident in her choices they will probably not get their childish kicks out of opening their ignorant mouths their lack of respect is funny how can someone be so dumb and rude it's hilarious you are right and they are wrong not because they eat meat but because they can't let you be different and make your own choices even though you are making a choice of compassion and wisdom keep your chin up and keep your face bright and smiling and they can't touch you if your dad is a total jerk about it maybe you shouldn't laugh then but never let him see on your face that what he is saying is getting to you then again if i were you i think i would laugh if my dad told me i was disabled or being stupid over not eating meat

what happens when we dont eat carbohydrate this is for a peice of work im doing thanks true you don't need carbohydrates if you want to live for at least a while anyway your brain unfortunately likes to exclusively use glucose from carbohydrates as an energy source unlike other organs it cannot fully utilize fats and proteins as an alternative energy source once you have depleted your carbohydrate reserves glycogen which sometimes can be as quickly as an overnight fast your brain will start to look for alternative sources of fuel either from glucose formed by new synthesis ok for a while or eventually from the breakdown of fat into what are called ketone bodies this will happen in the liver unfortunately the catabolism or breakdown of ketone bodies for energy is incomplete and over time the buildup of ketone bodies will lead to ketoacidosis or ketosis a situation where the elevated amounts of ketone bodies in the blood if this continues for long term a slew of problems may start to develop eventually leading to symptoms of starvation or diabetes this is why high protein high fat diets must be done carefully with a full understanding of the diet involved most of these diets may call for the absence of all carbs early for a short time with then a reintroduction of good carbs high in fiber and complex nature personally i would try to avoid it unless you're really in a situation where the benefits of weight loss are going to offset any risks from the diet  Diabetic ketoacidosis Carbohydrate Low-carbohydrate diet Glucose Insulin Glycogen storage disease type I Ketone bodies Ketoacidosis Weight training Ketone Glucokinase Protein-energy malnutrition Biochemistry Glycogen Protein Liver Nutrient Nutrition Hyperglycemia Glycemic index Cirrhosis Fatty acid Fasting Bodybuilding Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia Veganism Food Coronary heart disease Anorexia nervosa Cancer Glucocorticoid South Beach diet Acetone Breastfeeding Coeliac disease Growth hormone Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Milk Vegetarianism Citric acid cycle Hypercholesterolemia Tocopherol Hemoglobin Fatty acid metabolism Omega-3 fatty acid Haemochromatosis Folic acid Diabetic neuropathy Marathon (sport) Muscle Sugar substitute Metabolism Diabetic hypoglycemia Blood sugar Dietary fiber Binge eating disorder Coenzyme A Guinea pig Stroke Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sleep Stomach cancer Alzheimer's disease Calorie restriction Caffeine Sugar Hypertension Obesity Obstetrics Dialysis Exercise Mitochondrial genetics Traumatic brain injury Action potential Glycemia Lac operon Epilepsy Kidney Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Osteoporosis Decompression sickness Starch Diabetic retinopathy Cell (biology) Vitamin

how do i deal with people who dont approve of me being a vegatarian my mom is one also but im talking about others some that i dont even know i mean my mom is a vegetarian laugh when they say something stupid just laugh don't do it at them or even in their general direction completely ignore them with your body language but make sure they are aware that you think what they are saying is funny if they call on the phone and say something about it laugh i don't know what is wrong with them but if you act like a happy person that is confident in her choices they will probably not get their childish kicks out of opening their ignorant mouths their lack of respect is funny how can someone be so dumb and rude it's hilarious you are right and they are wrong not because they eat meat but because they can't let you be different and make your own choices even though you are making a choice of compassion and wisdom keep your chin up and keep your face bright and smiling and they can't touch you there is a japanese analogy proverb that goes like this the nail that sticks up is the one that gets hammered down people are like this everywhere when you tell people that it is your personal belief that animals should not be eaten they take a look at themselves and it can be subconsciously translated into what you do is wrong and i choose to be right many people have probably been taught a huge amount of misinformation by their parents and their teachers while growing up the meat industry has a lot of money and uses it to spread propaganda that makes others view us as irrational just ignore them if they have no ability to receive new information with an open mind  Buddhism Social rule Theory of conduct Joke Shaggy dog story Treehouse of Horror V Koan Lisa the Vegetarian Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Original sin Vegetarianism Poker jargon Milton H.

why be vegetarian not to get into a big thing here but why do you think you're better than evolution animals eat each other to survive if its a moral issue regarding how they are killed i can kinda understand it veil but i really can seem to get enough evidence to support not eating meat not to mention vegans and people who only eat wheat and stuff opinions studies have shown that vegetarians and vegans generally weigh less and have very reduced risks of several diseases including heart diesase cancer stroke they have lower cholesterol and bp and can be much more healthy than the average meat eater try reading the book the china study while most of those people aren't vegetarian they eat considerably less meat than we do hardly any red meat and chicken or fish just a couple times a week see how their veggie and nutrient rich diet makes them healthier than us i don't know about people who only eat wheat but there are plenty of nutrient sources for vegetarians and vegans to get protein calcium etc that most of us find in animal products  Veganism Vegetarian nutrition Dieting Coronary heart disease Raw food diet Atkins Nutritional Approach Milk Vegetarian cuisine Food Nutrition Omega-3 fatty acid Kashrut Prostate cancer Buddhist cuisine Soybean Tofu Chicken Hamburger Tocopherol People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Cheese Animal rights Low-carbohydrate diet Colorectal cancer Environmental vegetarianism Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Taboo food and drink Healthy eating Meat analogue Folic acid Oily fish Cyanocobalamin Vitamin C Whaling Hypercholesterolemia Organic food Factory farming Cardiovascular disease Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Coeliac disease Agriculture Atherosclerosis Obesity Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Domestic rabbit Cholesterol Stroke Cancer Meat Lisa the Vegetarian Hypertension Nutrient Kosher foods Guinea pig Tooth Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Peter Singer Soy milk Unclean animals Word of Wisdom Buddhism Cat Food guide pyramid Livestock Pizza Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Gelatin Cat food Alzheimer's disease French cuisine Food preservation Escherichia coli O157:H7 Stomach cancer Fruitarianism Domestic goat Protein Anemia Human skin color Dog Phytochemical Crohn's disease Pork Brain Natural Hygiene Burger McDonald's Oat Dim sum Low density lipoprotein

im really confuzed ok so my friends lets say there names are mike and tom my sisters boyfriend we'll say his name is martin and my sister we will say her name is alex were all by the pool today mike and tom tend to pick on me alot about beging a vegertarain saying i cant have children whice is crap mike and martin went to mcdonalds they came back with all meat then were trying to get me to eat a chicken micknugett sp they were telling me it was good for me and i was going to die without it what should i do i have to deal with these people for a few more days laugh when they say something stupid just laugh don't do it at them or even in their general direction completely ignore them with your body language but make sure they are aware that you think what they are saying is funny if they call on the phone and say something about it laugh i don't know what is wrong with them but if you act like a happy person that is confident in her choices they will probably not get their childish kicks out of opening their ignorant mouths their lack of respect is funny how can someone be so dumb and rude it's hilarious you are right and they are wrong not because they eat meat but because they can't let you be different and make your own choices even though you are making a choice of compassion and wisdom keep your chin up and keep your face bright and smiling and they can't touch you there have been vegan olympic gold medalists and a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential http en wikipedia org wiki carl lewis http www eatright org cps rde xchg ada hs xsl advocacy enu html draft htm if you want to become a lacto ovo vegetarian the transition should be quite simple almost all meats have widely available commercial replacements all that you have to do is replace any flesh in your diet beef pork poultry seafood with meat analogs or just leave it out altogether you should keep in mind that a journey such as this can be quite short but should just be the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this is because of the reality of factory farming in which animals that are kept alive to produce milk eggs etc suffer much more and longer than animals that are raised to a certain weight and then slaughtered http www veganoutreach org whyvegan http meat org some people use the word vegan in reference to this idea but be aware that applying that label to yourself should always come with the inclusion of wise activism and advocacy http www veganoutreach org advocacy index html two extremely important examples of this are that you should never speak to someone about vegetarianism veganism without their consent and genuine interest or as a comment on what they are eating and your dietary beliefs should never be used as an introduction or explanation of who you are as a person veg ism should be something that comes up after people get to know you and they offer you a situation that makes it confusing to withhold the information discussion also if you are presented something that you choose not to eat or you are ordering food eating together somewhere picking the best place to eat when you you hold off on the subject until it's necessary and then act like it isn't a big deal at all people are usually surprised and way more interested and curious than if you were to bring it up when someone's eating or just using it as a conversation starter a responsible vegan always studies the subject of their own health and how to keep their body completely provided for in every sense http www veganhealth org sh to neglect their body is to define a plant based diet as unhealthy and is the opposite of helping the animals just to clear things up the vegetarian vegan diet is not composed of salads vegetables fruit and fake meat fruits and vegetables are always important but they do not make up the largest portion of any healthy diet a balanced plant based diet includes grains breads pasta rice cereal legumes soy beans peas lentils fruit and vegetables http www pcrm org health veginfo vsk food groups html http www peta org accidentallyvegan http www veganoutreach org whyvegan eating html being vegan can be an art one whose challenge is to take things that involve the suffering of the innocent and change them into something free of cruelty a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential technically the term vegetarian does imply that you don't consume anything that comes from the body of an animal that requires killing it many ingredients such as gelatin and glycerin are found in many candies fig newtons and many of other foods as well as rennet found in many cheeses http www happycow net health animal ingredients html the best thing to remember is to take your time so that for example when you are comfortable not eating beef and pork you can then give up chicken when you are sure you can make the commitment permanently depending on your age or reliance on parents or regional options it may not be best to give yourself a label the important thing is to do your best to make progress and be committed to your compassion towards animals never put your focus onto what you or other people use to describe yourself if you meet someone that talks down to people for eating meat dairy etc or to you because they think they are more veg than you laugh in their face and tell them they are a disgrace to the entire philosophy people like this only hurt the idea of veg ism and the animals the point of all of this is to live compassionately and and as free from cruelty as you can all the while maintaining your health and a positive attitude people who don't maintain either need not open their mouths and represent our beliefs if you actually choose to read all of this i hope it helps if not feel free to e mail me if you have questions i'm vegan and these are some of my favorite things to eat breakfast bananas cream of wheat with brown sugar and soy butter cereal pancakes or french toast with real maple syrup vegan sausage patties smoothies snack brussel sprouts no joke lunch vegan sausage sandwiches sandwiches with vegan deli slices tofurkey is the only one that's kinda funky fruit dinner leftovers couscous salad vegan sushi potato or pasta salad dinner sloppy joes sausage and gravy with homemade biscuits spaghetti and trader joe's meatballs or tvp lasagna thai pad see ew pad khi mao drunkard's noodles pad prig king tofu eggplant with basil sauce yellow thai curry with tofu or vegan chikn and veggies and jasmine rice indian dal with homemade roti or dosai channa masala aloo gobi vegetable or minestrone soup pizza steamed pork buns with potstickers or spring rolls sweet sour orange lemon chikn

does gardenburger or any other vegetarian company have a commercial if not why i've never seen one i suspect it's because they have a far smaller budget than purveyors of meat products nobody asks for gardenburger to lend their name to a movie the way the simpsons movie and murder king are linked or how name that disney movie pushes toys through mcdeathburger probably because gardenburger and amy's who makes a line of vegetarian mostly organic foods don't have the marketing budget besides i'd rather they spend the money on making the product as wholesome and tasty as possible  Vegetarianism Lisa the Vegetarian McDonald's Hamburger Meat analogue Vegetarian cuisine O scale Vegetarianism and religion Ethical consumerism Aladdin (1992 film) Meat Egg (food) Anime Kangaroo Sears Holdings Corporation Food Tofu Soybean Steve Jobs Hilary Duff Sausage Aerosmith "Weird Al" Yankovic Modern animation of the United States The Walt Disney Company Wal-Mart Burger King Financial markets Common Agricultural Policy Kellogg Company Quorn Bank Pixar Barbecue Economy of Moldova Organic food Veganism Oscar Mayer Organic farming Ketchup Toy Story 2 Brunch Kashrut The Apprentice 2 Slaughterhouse W.

becoming a vegetarian again okay so i was a vegetarian a while a back then i went back to being meat eater presser from family and friends at the start of it i hated and and every time i ate meat i felt sick and fat and thought about all the animals that dies everyday just so i can eat a hamburger i want to be vegetarian and this time i am willing to stick to this lifestyle need information and websites i deleted my bookmarks any thing else u think i need to know plz if u aren't vegan or a vegetarian don't answer i don't want ur opion i just need information on how to go vegetarian sorry for the bad spelling spell check is messed up today i'm about to be and live on my own thanks a million the most important step is to learn how to cook or do it as often as possible try as many new things as possible to keep your diet interesting and make a balanced diet as enjoyable as possible this is even more important because you are just starting on your own and shouldn't waste money on prepackaged frozen meals foods which can be ridiculously overpriced especially those that are aimed at vegetarian people there have been vegan olympic gold medalists and a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential http en wikipedia org wiki carl lewis http www eatright org cps rde xchg ada hs xsl advocacy enu html draft htm if you want to become a lacto ovo vegetarian the transition should be quite simple almost all meats have widely available commercial replacements all that you have to do is replace any flesh in your diet beef pork poultry seafood with meat analogs or just leave it out altogether you should keep in mind that a journey such as this can be quite short but should just be the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this is because of the reality of factory farming in which animals that are kept alive to produce milk eggs etc suffer much more and longer than animals that are raised to a certain weight and then slaughtered http www veganoutreach org whyvegan http meat org some people use the word vegan in reference to this idea but be aware that applying that label to yourself should always come with the inclusion of wise activism and advocacy http www veganoutreach org advocacy index html two extremely important examples of this are that you should never speak to someone about vegetarianism veganism without their consent and genuine interest or as a comment on what they are eating and your dietary beliefs should never be used as an introduction or explanation of who you are as a person veg ism should be something that comes up after people get to know you and they offer you a situation that makes it confusing to withhold the information discussion also if you are presented something that you choose not to eat or you are ordering food eating together somewhere picking the best place to eat when you you hold off on the subject until it's necessary and then act like it isn't a big deal at all people are usually surprised and way more interested and curious than if you were to bring it up when someone's eating or just using it as a conversation starter a responsible vegan always studies the subject of their own health and how to keep their body completely provided for in every sense http www veganhealth org sh to neglect their body is to define a plant based diet as unhealthy and is the opposite of helping the animals just to clear things up the vegetarian vegan diet is not composed of salads vegetables fruit and fake meat fruits and vegetables are always important but they do not make up the largest portion of any healthy diet a balanced plant based diet includes grains breads pasta rice cereal legumes soy beans peas lentils fruit and vegetables http www pcrm org health veginfo vsk food groups html http www peta org accidentallyvegan http www veganoutreach org whyvegan eating html being vegan can be an art one whose challenge is to take things that involve the suffering of the innocent and change them into something free of cruelty a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential technically the term vegetarian does imply that you don't consume anything that comes from the body of an animal that requires killing it many ingredients such as gelatin and glycerin are found in many candies fig newtons and many of other foods as well as rennet found in many cheeses http www happycow net health animal ingredients html the best thing to remember is to take your time so that for example when you are comfortable not eating beef and pork you can then give up chicken when you are sure you can make the commitment permanently depending on your age or reliance on parents or regional options it may not be best to give yourself a label the important thing is to do your best to make progress and be committed to your compassion towards animals never put your focus onto what you or other people use to describe yourself if you meet someone that talks down to people for eating meat dairy etc or to you because they think they are more veg than you laugh in their face and tell them they are a disgrace to the entire philosophy people like this only hurt the idea of veg ism and the animals the point of all of this is to live compassionately and and as free from cruelty as you can all the while maintaining your health and a positive attitude people who don't maintain either need not open their mouths and represent our beliefs if you actually choose to read all of this i hope it helps if not feel free to e mail me if you have questions i'm vegan and these are some of my favorite things to eat breakfast bananas cream of wheat with brown sugar and soy butter cereal pancakes or french toast with real maple syrup vegan sausage patties smoothies snack brussel sprouts no joke lunch vegan sausage sandwiches sandwiches with vegan deli slices tofurkey is the only one that's kinda funky fruit dinner leftovers couscous salad vegan sushi potato or pasta salad dinner sloppy joes sausage and gravy with homemade biscuits spaghetti and trader joe's meatballs or

do you know about isinglass in wine beer etc i've been veg for years but recently discovered about isinglass from fish bladder in wine and beer does anyone know if all wines have this and if other liquors do too although very little isinglass remains in the beer which is drunk many vegetarians consider beers such as guinness which are processed with these finings to be unsuitable for vegetarian diets although it is suitable for pescetarians an alternative to isinglass which is suitable for vegetarians is irish moss a type of red alga the process differs however isinglass is added at the end of the brewing process before bottling whereas irish moss is added to the hot wort while it is being boiled and primarily reduces hazes caused by proteins since the two fining agents act differently some beers will make use of both isinglass finings are also used in the production of kosher wines although for reasons of kashrut they are not derived from the sturgeon as this fish is considered not kosher it is not really used a lot today it was primarily used prior to the inexpensive production of gelatin and now they even plant gelatins  Beer Gelatin Brewery Veganism Kashrut Vegetarianism Coffee Alcoholic beverage Cider Brewing Wine Sake Tofu Halaal Marshmallow Cheese British cuisine Jewish cuisine Tea Kosher wine Cuisine of Denmark Fishing Soy milk Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Korean cuisine Rum Bread Food Moonshine Miller Brewing Single malt Scotch Public house Peruvian cuisine German cuisine Vinegar Prohibition Chinese wine Hot dog Taboo food and drink Coronary heart disease Unclean animals Port wine Milk Cuisine of the Philippines Guinness Wheat beer Sewage treatment Distilled beverage Healthy eating Champagne (beverage) French cuisine Pisco Sugar substitute Antidepressant Cochineal Sturgeon Hop (plant) Cuisine of Brazil Russian cuisine Hydrochloric acid Scotch whisky Gluten-free diet Food preservation William Murdoch Acetic acid Cuisine Stout beer Malt liquor Bock Prostate cancer Biodiesel Surimi Vegetarian nutrition Chocolate Technicolor Breastfeeding Meat analogue Ethanol Mashgiach Espresso K__lsch (beer) Soft drink Cancer Liquor store Frog Dieting Finings Ketchup Portland cement Omega-3 fatty acid Sauna Ramen South African Breweries Cuisine of Argentina

what foods are considered to be complete protein im a vegitarian and i need protein what are some healthy alternatives that contain protein pls that would be great there is a difference between the protein found in animals and the protein found in plants animal proteins contain all of the essential amino acids needed by the body while plants contain only some of the essential amino acids the reason they are called essential amino acids is because the body will not function correctly without them there are ways to complete the essential amino acid chains by eating vegetable matter that contains different amino acids grains nuts and legumes all have some of the amino acids that you need to survive and by combining these groups in certain ways you can achieve complete protein nutrition the vast majority of the world lives on a diet of rice and beans because it s affordable and can be grown in many different climates here are some types of plants that fit into the above categories for the purpose of completing proteins grains barley bulgur buckwheat corn and cornmeal oats rice rye wheat pasta usually made from one of these items anyway legumes beans chickpeas lentils peanuts peas soybeans nuts seeds cashews pumpkin seeds sesame seeds sunflower seeds other nuts not peanuts they are legumes by combining two of these three groups you can achieve total protein nutrition if you do not eat meat fish eggs or dairy  Vegetarian nutrition Agriculture Peanut Legume Amino acid Bread Nutrition Carnitine Pulse (legume) Tofu Flowering plant Porridge Barley Passover Organic food Flour Bean Japanese cuisine Miso Biodiesel Rice Soy milk Seed Dietary fiber Food preservation Kosher foods Wheat Cuisine of the Southern United States Food guide pyramid Meat analogue Hamster Soul food Fancy rat Paleolithic diet Crop rotation Folic acid Coeliac disease Vegetable oil Fruit Pea Green Revolution Common bean Nutrient Raw food diet German cuisine Cuisine of Africa Nut (fruit) Insulin Lentil Dieting Oat Cooking oil Breakfast Gluten-free diet Quinoa Cheese Genetically modified food Sprouting Milk Peruvian cuisine Niacin Ecology Cuisine of Malaysia Bengali cuisine Cell (biology) Enzyme Cuisine of Turkey Monosodium glutamate Vitamin Crohn's disease Jewish cuisine Vegetarian cuisine Pigeon pea Essential amino acid Human skin color Manchukuo and Mengchiang (agriculture, farming, lumber and fishing) Allergy Cuisine of Denmark Chickpea Chili con carne PDCAAS Potato Cashew Hamburger Low-carbohydrate diet Roman eating and drinking

can i use a banana for egg substitute in pancake mix or what else could i use flax seed mayo has raw eggs in it from the post punk kitchen flax seeds how to use it tablespoon flax seeds plus tablespoons water replaces one egg finely grind tablespoon whole flaxseeds in a blender or coffee grinder or use tablespoons pre ground flaxseeds transfer to a bowl and beat in tablespoons of water using a whisk or fork it will become very gooey and gelatinous much like an egg white in some recipes you can leave the ground flax in the blender and add the other wet ingredients to it thus saving you the extra step of the bowl when it works best flax seeds have a distinct earthy granola taste it tastes best and works very well in things like pancakes and whole grain items such as bran muffins and corn muffins it is perfect for oatmeal cookies and the texture works for cookies in general although the taste may be too pronounced for some chocolate cake y recipes have mixed results i would recommend only using one portion flax egg in those because the taste can be overpowering tips always store ground flaxseeds in the freezer because they are highly perishable this mixture is not only an excellent replacement for eggs it also contributes vital omega fatty acids where to get it health food stores silken tofu how to use it cup blended silken tofu egg whiz in a blender until completely smooth and creamy leaving no graininess or chunks you will want to add other wet ingredients to this mixture to get it to blend properly i recommend vacuum packed extra firm silken tofu such as mori nu when it works best dense cakes and brownies and in smaller quantites for lighter cakes and fluffy things if the recipe calls for eggs only use tofu eggs whizzed tofu leaves virtually no taste so it is an excellent replacer in cake recipes in cookie recipes it may make the cookie more cake y and fluffy than anticipated add teaspoon of starch to the recipe such as arrowroot or corn starch to combat that it may make pancakes a little heavy so it is not recommended as a quick replacement for eggs in pancakes although it could work well with a little experimentation where to get it health food store shelves and in some supermarkets ener g egg replacer how to use it tablespoons tablespoons water mixed well egg many people swear by this egg replacer i think it is good to use in a pinch in all baking that requires a few eggs however i can definitely taste it in cakes and cookies tastes chalk y and i'm not crazy about the dense texture it turns out when it works best it seems to work best in cookies or things that are supposed to be a little crispy where to get it health food stores some supermarkets in the baking or ethnic food section bananas how to use it banana blended until smooth or mashed well egg bananas work wonders as an egg replacer in baking which is the reason many banana bread recipes don't require eggs they hold the air bubbles well make things nice and moist and impart a nice flavor however you don't want everything tasting like banana so use in things where the taste won't be intrusive i've also noticed that baked goods using banana brown very nicely when it works best quick breads muffins cakes pancakes tip make sure bananas are nice and ripe and have started to brown where to get it just kidding i think you can figure this one out soy yogurt how to use it cup soy yogurt egg soy yogurt works a lot like whizzed tofu as an egg replacer it makes things moist and yummy when it works best quick breads muffins cakes where to get it health food stores yuppyish supermarkets  Cookie Soy milk Jewish cuisine Beer Veganism Potato Egg (food) Hamburger Cuisine of Singapore Cuisine of Malaysia Brewery Chili con carne Bengali cuisine Pizza Food Cantonese cuisine Soy protein Cold Stone Creamery French cuisine Ramen Vegetarianism Muesli Haggis Barbecue Sushi Cuisine of Brazil Organic food McDonald's Vinegar Yoghurt Omega-3 fatty acid Tamale Chinese cuisine Peruvian cuisine Idli Milk Dim sum Kosher foods Cake Banana Hot dog Textile manufacturing Cajun cuisine Swedish cuisine Potato pancakes Rice Korean cuisine Sake Food preservation Cookware and bakeware German cuisine Peanut butter Dumpling Soybean Rum Food science Cuisine of the Southern United States Cocoa Rice pudding Meat analogue Cha chaan teng Soy sauce Alcoholic beverage Domesticated turkey Oreo Milkshake Single malt Scotch Starch Hamster Soup Plastic Tortilla Wine making Olive oil Fecal incontinence Gumbo Mooncake

trying to be a vegetarian i'm going into the th grade and am trying to become a vegetarian i have been doing ok and for the most part have suport from my family however i'm having trouble coming up with what to do when my family is having chicken or steak or fish of something for dinner what are some simple meals i can make for myself chicken steak and fish all have substitutes and i'm not referring to tofu i'm vegan and these are some of my favorite things to eat breakfast bananas cream of wheat with brown sugar and soy butter cereal pancakes or french toast with real maple syrup vegan sausage patties smoothies snack brussel sprouts no joke lunch vegan sausage sandwiches sandwiches with vegan deli slices tofurkey is the only one that's kinda funky fruit dinner leftovers couscous salad vegan sushi potato or pasta salad dinner sloppy joes sausage and gravy with homemade biscuits spaghetti and trader joe's meatballs or tvp lasagna thai pad see ew pad khi mao drunkard's noodles pad prig king tofu eggplant with basil sauce yellow thai curry with tofu or vegan chikn and veggies and jasmine rice indian dal with homemade roti or dosai channa masala aloo gobi vegetable or minestrone soup pizza steamed pork buns with potstickers or spring rolls sweet sour orange lemon chikn vegan pho or wonton soup baked tofu bbq homemade seitan tastes like meat from boiled bbq'd ribs i use these sites to find recipes http www foodnetwork com http vegweb com http www recipezaar com there have been vegan olympic gold medalists and a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential http en wikipedia org wiki carl lewis http www eatright org cps rde xchg ada hs xsl advocacy enu html draft htm if you want to become a lacto ovo vegetarian the transition should be quite simple almost all meats have widely available commercial replacements all that you have to do is replace any flesh in your diet beef pork poultry seafood with meat analogs or just leave it out altogether you should keep in mind that a journey such as this can be quite short but should just be the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this is because of the reality of factory farming in which animals that are kept alive to produce milk eggs etc suffer much more and longer than animals that are raised to a certain weight and then slaughtered http www veganoutreach org whyvegan http meat org some people use the word vegan in reference to this idea but be aware that applying that label to yourself should always come with the inclusion of wise activism and advocacy http www veganoutreach org advocacy index html two extremely important examples of this are that you should never speak to someone about vegetarianism veganism without their consent and genuine interest or as a comment on what they are eating and your dietary beliefs should never be used as an introduction or explanation of who you are as a person veg ism should be something that comes up after people get to know you and they offer you a situation that makes it confusing to withhold the information discussion also if you are presented something that you choose not to eat or you are ordering food eating together somewhere picking the best place to eat when you you hold off on the subject until it's necessary and then act like it isn't a big deal at all people are usually surprised and way more interested and curious than if you were to bring it up when someone's eating or just using it as a conversation starter a responsible vegan always studies the subject of their own health and how to keep their body completely provided for in every sense http www veganhealth org sh to neglect their body is to define a plant based diet as unhealthy and is the opposite of helping the animals just to clear things up the vegetarian vegan diet is not composed of salads vegetables fruit and fake meat fruits and vegetables are always important but they do not make up the largest portion of any healthy diet a balanced plant based diet includes grains breads pasta rice cereal legumes soy beans peas lentils fruit and vegetables http www pcrm org health veginfo vsk food groups html http www peta org accidentallyvegan http www veganoutreach org whyvegan eating html being vegan can be an art one whose challenge is to take things that involve the suffering of the innocent and change them into something free of cruelty a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential technically the term vegetarian does imply that you don't consume anything that comes from the body of an animal that requires killing it many ingredients such as gelatin and glycerin are found in many candies fig newtons and many of other foods as well as rennet found in many cheeses http www happycow net health animal ingredients html the best thing to remember is to take your time so that for example when you are comfortable not eating beef and pork you can then give up chicken when you are sure you can make the commitment permanently depending on your age or reliance on parents or regional options it may not be best to give yourself a label the important thing is to do your best to make progress and be committed to your compassion towards animals never put your focus onto what you or other people use to describe yourself if you meet someone that talks down to people for eating meat dairy etc or to you because they think they are more veg than you laugh in their face and tell them they are a disgrace to the entire philosophy people like this only hurt the idea of veg ism and the animals the point of all of this is to live compassionately and and as free from cruelty as you can all the while maintaining your health and a positive attitude people who don't maintain either need not open their mouths and represent our beliefs if you actually choose to read all of this i hope it helps if not feel free to e mail me if you have questions if anyone tries to say anything negative about your choice which is very likely to happen laugh when they say something stupid just laugh don't do it at them or even in their general direction completely ignore them with your body language but make sure they are aware that you think what they are saying is funny if they call on the phone and say something about it laugh i don't know what is wrong with some people but if you act like a happy person that is confident in her choices they will probably not get their childish kicks out of opening their ignorant mouths their lack of respect is funny how can someone be so dumb and rude it's hilarious you are right and they are wrong not because they eat meat but because they can't let you be different and make your own choices even though you are making a choice of compassion and wisdom keep your chin up and keep your face bright and smiling and they can't touch you

how much protein do i need i have recently started a vegetarian diet and want to make sure i'm getting enough but not too much since i would like to loose weight as well about lbs no i am not becoming a vegetarian to loose weight the first answerer gave you false information you do not need that much protein here is what you need women to yrs g women to yrs g women to yrs g women yrs g pregnant women g breast feeding women to g being vegetarian does not mean your diet will be lacking in protein most plant foods contain protein and in fact it would be very difficult to design a vegetarian diet that is short on protein excess dietary protein may lead to health problems it it now thought that one of the benefits of a vegetarian diet is that it contains adequate but not excessive protein proteins are made up of smaller units called amino acids there are about different amino acids eight of which must be present in the diet these are the essential amino acids unlike animal proteins plant proteins may not contain all the essential amino acids in the necessary proportions however a varied vegetarian diet means a mixture of proteins are consumed the amino acids in one protein compensating for the deficiencies of another most foods contain at least some protein good sources of protein for vegetarians include nuts and seeds pulses soya products tofu soya milk and textured soya protein such as soya mince cereals wheat oats and rice free range eggs and some dairy products milk cheese and yoghurt different foods contain different proteins each with their own unique amino acid composition the proportions of essential amino acids in foods may differ from the proportions needed by the body to make proteins the proportion of each of the essential amino acids in foods containing protein determines the quality of that protein dietary proteins with all the essential amino acids in the proportions required by the body are said to be a high quality protein if the protein is low in one or more of the essential amino acids the protein is of a lower quality the amino acid that is in shortest supply is called the limiting amino acid protein quality is usually defined according to the amino acid pattern of egg protein which is regarded as the ideal as such it is not surprising that animal proteins such as meat milk and cheese tend to be of a higher protein quality than plant proteins this is why plant proteins are sometimes referred to as low quality proteins many plant proteins are low in one of the essential amino acids for instance grains tend to be short of lysine whilst pulses are short of methionine this does not mean that vegetarians or vegans go short on essential amino acids combining plant proteins such as a grain with a pulse leads to a high quality protein which is just as good and in some cases better than protein from animal foods soya is a high quality protein on its own which can be regarded as equal to meat protein the limiting amino acid tends to be different in different proteins this means when two different foods are combined the amino acids in one protein can compensate for the one lacking in the other this is known as protein complementing vegetarians and vegans eating a well balanced diet based on grains pulses seeds nuts and vegetables will be consuming a mixture of proteins that complement one another naturally without requiring any planning beans on toast cheese or peanut butter sandwich muesli with milk soya or cow's and rice with peas or beans are all common examples of protein complementing previously it has been thought that protein complementing needed to occur within a single meal however it is now known that this is not necessary as the body keeps a short term store of the essential amino acids a well balanced vegetarian or vegan will easily supply all the protein and essential amino acids needed by the body  Nutrient Kosher foods Guinea pig Kashrut Agriculture Soy protein Amino acid Hamburger Meat analogue Tocopherol PDCAAS Breastfeeding Biochemistry Food preservation Bengali cuisine Egg (food) Dietary fiber Peanut butter Low-carbohydrate diet Zinc Growth hormone treatment Vitamin Peanut Protein-energy malnutrition Peruvian cuisine Vitamin C Yoghurt Vegetarianism and religion Environmental vegetarianism Rice Coronary heart disease Cuisine of Brazil Enzyme Food guide pyramid Sausage Taboo food and drink Cat Chili con carne Crohn's disease Iron Cuisine of Singapore Muesli Livestock Cancer Carnivorous plant Weight training Microeconomics Genetically modified food Ecology Porridge Anemia Common bean Vitasoy Food allergy Protein structure Pancake Protein sequencing Healthy eating Human skin color Niacin Hamster Coffee Prostate cancer Domestication German cuisine

i just became a vegetarian my mom thinks i should eat fish if i do am i still considered a vegetarian vegetarians never eat cows pigs chickens fish shrimp scallops worms ants or any other animal there is a japanese analogy proverb that goes like this the nail that sticks up is the one that gets hammered down people are like this everywhere when you tell your family that it is your personal belief that animals should not be eaten they take a look at themselves and it can be subconsciously translated into what you do is wrong and i choose to be right your parents have probably been taught a huge amount of misinformation by their parents and their teachers while growing up you really need to research vegetarian diets and health before you even think about saying the v word in front of your parents when you have gathered enough information and feel confident in a vegetarian diet's ability to maintain or even improve health you may mention to them that you have made the decision they may be shocked angry worried curious or many other things but you must never react to their behavior and always stay calm if they are able to speak to you and respect your choice please tell them everything and answer all questions if they are rude inconsiderate judgmental violent or verbally abusive refuse to continue any conversation until they can speak to you with respect the best advice is to study everything that you can about a healthy vegetarian diet and keep yourself in good shape better than most people your age or than your friends family if possible if nobody that you know shows a genuine positive interest in your choice don't give them the privilege of the knowledge that you have gathered work your way around any attempts they make to trivialize your beliefs and if possible go shopping with your parents and buy things that aren't obvious veggie fare instead of trying to sneak fake meat into the cart toss in lentil soup peanut butter pasta fruits veggies or anything else that you have learned is needed to fill any gaps in your diet there have been vegan olympic gold medalists and a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential http en wikipedia org wiki carl lewis http www eatright org cps rde xchg ada hs xsl advocacy enu html draft htm if you want to become a lacto ovo vegetarian the transition should be quite simple almost all meats have widely available commercial replacements all that you have to do is replace any flesh in your diet beef pork poultry seafood with meat analogs or just leave it out altogether you should keep in mind that a journey such as this can be quite short but should just be the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this is because of the reality of factory farming in which animals that are kept alive to produce milk eggs etc suffer much more and longer than animals that are raised to a certain weight and then slaughtered http www veganoutreach org whyvegan http meat org some people use the word vegan in reference to this idea but be aware that applying that label to yourself should always come with the inclusion of wise activism and advocacy http www veganoutreach org advocacy index html two extremely important examples of this are that you should never speak to someone about vegetarianism veganism without their consent and genuine interest or as a comment on what they are eating and your dietary beliefs should never be used as an introduction or explanation of who you are as a person veg ism should be something that comes up after people get to know you and they offer you a situation that makes it confusing to withhold the information discussion also if you are presented something that you choose not to eat or you are ordering food eating together somewhere picking the best place to eat when you you hold off on the subject until it's necessary and then act like it isn't a big deal at all people are usually surprised and way more interested and curious than if you were to bring it up when someone's eating or just using it as a conversation starter a responsible vegan always studies the subject of their own health and how to keep their body completely provided for in every sense http www veganhealth org sh to neglect their body is to define a plant based diet as unhealthy and is the opposite of helping the animals just to clear things up the vegetarian vegan diet is not composed of salads vegetables fruit and fake meat fruits and vegetables are always important but they do not make up the largest portion of any healthy diet a balanced plant based diet includes grains breads pasta rice cereal legumes soy beans peas lentils fruit and vegetables http www pcrm org health veginfo vsk food groups html http www peta org accidentallyvegan http www veganoutreach org whyvegan eating html being vegan can be an art one whose challenge is to take things that involve the suffering of the innocent and change them into something free of cruelty a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential technically the term vegetarian does imply that you don't consume anything that comes from the body of an animal that requires killing it many ingredients such as gelatin and glycerin are found in many candies fig newtons and many of other foods as well as rennet found in many cheeses http www happycow net health animal ingredients html the best thing to remember is to take your time so that for example when you are comfortable not eating beef and pork you can then give up chicken when you are sure you can make the commitment permanently depending on your age or reliance on parents or regional options it may not be best to give yourself a label the important thing is to do your best to make progress and be committed to your compassion towards animals never put your focus onto what you or other people use to describe yourself if you meet someone that talks down to people for eating meat dairy etc or to you because they think they are more veg than you laugh in their face and tell them they are a disgrace to the entire philosophy people like this only hurt the idea of veg ism and the animals the point of all of this is to live compassionately and and as free from cruelty as you can all the while maintaining your health and a positive attitude people who don't maintain either need not open their mouths and represent our beliefs if you actually choose to read all of this i hope it helps if not feel free to e mail me if you have questions i'm vegan and these are some of my favorite things to eat breakfast bananas cream of wheat with brown sugar and soy butter cereal pancakes or french toast with real maple syrup vegan sausage patties smoothies snack brussel sprouts no joke lunch vegan sausage sandwiches sandwiches with vegan deli slices tofurkey is the only one that's kinda funky fruit dinner leftovers couscous salad vegan sushi potato or pasta salad dinner sloppy joes sausage and gravy with homemade biscuits spaghetti and trader joe's meatballs or tvp lasagna thai pad see ew pad khi mao drunkard's noodles pad prig king tofu eggplant with basil sauce yellow thai curry with tofu or vegan chikn and veggies and jasmine rice indian dal with homemade roti or dosai channa masala aloo gobi vegetable or

vegetarian protein on friday i decided that i was going to become a vegetarian i havent had any meat since friday but what i need to know is how i can get protein if im not eating meat i know there like yogurt beans peanut butter granola fish well fruit cheese etc i became a vegetarian because of peta well what kind of vegetarian will you be some people are ovo lactic vegetarians they eat eggs and milk assuming that these products are not killing a live animal so there's no inherent cruelty tho' what goes on in many poultry and dairy farms is rather cruel so if you're committed to peta you'll at least want to know your source in this case you're getting plenty of protein if you eat a couple of eggs and a good bit of dairy daily and it's got a full range of nutrients if you're going to be a full fledged vegan no animal products whatsoever then you will need to learn about how different plant products provide different nutrients you will need to consume a mix of beans legumes nuts and seeds daily because each one provides a different set of essential amino acids the old vegetarian cookbook diet for a small planet explains it in detail tho' the book's assertion that you must consume these proteins in combination has been found incorrect many vegans satisfy their protein needs by getting meat analogs tofurkey and soy sausages and fauxbaloney for my money if i am going to be a vegetarian i am not going to pretend i'm still eating flesh but that's your call if you go that way then the processed tvp will have a full range of amino acids in most cases if vegan you also should pay close attention to folic acid you might want supplements if you can't stand eating enough leafy greens and other sources i recommend that you study these things in some detail before you commit to vegetarianism  Tofu Meat analogue Cheese Vegetarian cuisine Protein Egg (food) Kashrut Omega-3 fatty acid Breakfast People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Raw food diet Dairy Healthy eating Cuisine of Brazil Peanut Animal rights Kosher foods Nutrition Sausage Food guide pyramid Livestock Nutrient French cuisine Peruvian cuisine Compost Taboo food and drink Environmental vegetarianism Meat Factory farming Pizza Soy milk Cuisine of Denmark Fruitarianism Chili con carne Bengali cuisine Cyanocobalamin Yoghurt Atkins Nutritional Approach Japanese cuisine Butter Jewish cuisine Korean cuisine Crohn's disease Cuisine of the Philippines Coronary heart disease Chocolate Agriculture Paleolithic diet Carnivorous plant Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Hot dog Cuisine of Africa Zinc Dairy product Cuisine of Malaysia German cuisine Chicken Roman eating and drinking Hamburger Buddhist cuisine Ice cream Dietary fiber Guinea pig Whaling Agriculture in Australia Chinese cuisine Blood Vitamin C Prostate cancer Rice Vitamin Flax Natt__ Cajun cuisine Cochineal Vitasoy Carnivore Unclean animals Amino acid

do vegans believe in taking fish oil capsules i know they don't eat fish but doctors seem to think daily doses of fish oil are pretty important what do vegans think about that if your doctor has said that fish oil is good you must try and know why it's good what does it contain that make it good for health there are many non veg foods that are good for health because of some essential nutrients but these nutrients are often found in a purely veg version too likewise fish oil contains omega essential fatty acids for proper functioning of cells and to prevent inflammation but did you know that one spoonful of ground flaxseed can bring you almost of your daily allowance of omega and walnuts too are very good sources of this essential fatty acid so if you are vegetarian try these next time you are advised to eat something non veg try to find a vegetarian substitute  Omega-3 fatty acid Veganism Vegetarian nutrition Nutrition Vegetarianism Coronary heart disease Oily fish Folic acid Fatty acid Flax Egg (food) Vitamin Bipolar disorder Soybean Fish oil Tofu Nutrient Prostate cancer Raw food diet Vitamin C Dieting Phytochemical Trans fat Cyanocobalamin Cheese Milk Olive oil Alzheimer's disease Healthy eating Tocopherol Fermentation Food guide pyramid Insulin Coeliac disease Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Docosahexaenoic acid Soul food Peanut butter Biodiesel Vitamin D Hypoglycemia Baldness treatments Margarine Cooking oil Bengali cuisine Snake oil Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Fasting Food Chocolate Carnivorous plant Acne E number Psoriasis Vegetarian cuisine Cystic fibrosis Linolenic acid Diarrhea Salmon Fish and chips Cardiovascular disease Cell (biology) Breastfeeding Kashrut Foodborne illness Saturated fat Tooth enamel Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Lecithin Kosher foods Peruvian cuisine Ketchup Hamburger British cuisine Hepatitis Myxobolus cerebralis Jute Hemp Antiretroviral drug Peanut Gelatin Cuisine of Brazil Vegetable oil Linseed oil Korean cuisine Sugar substitute Knife Fat Biochemistry Lisa the Vegetarian Meat analogue Protein Clinical depression Glycerin French cuisine Essential oil

do you know that i am starting to love you vegetarians i learned about the way chickens have been treated and have been feeling sick ever since i don't consider myself a softy but i had parakeets and birds have very distinctive personalities and emotions some food must be killed but not tortured for profit i used to have beautiful pet chickens in my city yard called penelope athena and helen they were rescued from a battery hen farm but we made them healthy they rewarded us with lovely eggs and did lots of good work in my vege garden every morning i'd call chook chook chook and they'd come running for their feed and i'd sit with them having my coffee they had such cute funny and sweet personalities and were very close to each other i'd be in stitches laughing every time they'd go crazy together and chase the neighbour's cat and rooster away chickens like other birds feel pain and distress regardless of intelligence and it makes me feel desperately sad to think of poor chickens in cramped and dirty factory farms feeling tortured from their bodies becoming deformed in those tiny wire cages the way chickens are treated in modern factory farms is completely immoral i find it so hard to understand why people will buy the cheap eggs instead of the free open range eggs just to save a few dollars but they will spend those dollars on coke or junk food i guess a lot of people just don't think about it but thank you for thinking about it you make a very valid point that we shouldn't torture animals just to make the products cheap and bigger profits killing an animal quickly and humanely after it has led a comfortable life is a very different story views differ on whether it is necessary to kill animals for food but i for one would feel better knowing that if animals are being killed for food that they are at least not being tortured i pray for the day that we have strong animal cruelty laws for all animals regardless of whether they are our pets or our food source  Egg (food) Chicken Animal rights Factory farming Theory of conduct Dog RuneScape quests The Amber Spyglass Garfield Kashrut Veganism Fancy rat Cat Descendants of Darkness Hamster Kodocha Shaggy dog story Sin City Dairy Domestic rabbit Ferret Hunting People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Pitaten Ranma __ characters Guinea pig Scenes from a Memory Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Friends One Piece minor characters Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Agriculture The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Omega-3 fatty acid Taboo food and drink Zoophilia Livestock Ron and Fez Joke Food Sea-Monkey Bird Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Dog training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) AFI 100 Years series Lisa the Vegetarian Jon Secada Time Out of Mind Human Unreal Cock (chicken) Foie gras Capercaillie Nineteen Eighty-Four Daredevil Organic farming H5N1 Internet phenomenon Serial killer Animal Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sexual orientation Phoebe Buffay's songs Simone Weil Odysseus Social rule Animal communication Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography The Death Gate Cycle YuYu Hakusho Physical attractiveness The Catcher in the Rye Aladdin (1992 film) A Course In Miracles Trapping Gorgias Teen Girl Squad Traditional Chinese medicine Abortion debate Organic food Cuisine of Malaysia Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex The Secret of NIMH Utilitarianism Environmental vegetarianism Domesticated turkey

turning into a vegetarian good idea or what real question what can vegans not eat many things have animal products in them in order to preserve them maintain texture smell good etc to my understanding yogurt cheese toothpaste shampoo all have animal products in them what other food products or things have animal products in them can you name the specific products like dial family doctor was just wondering i am not a vegan just exploring different parts of society i have been vegetarian for five years and vegan for four i believe that the more people there are that can respect the lives of cows chickens fish and even shrimp the more likely they are to respect differences in other people and contribute to a more peaceful society there is much mystery surrounding an animal free diet but only because tradition and powerful industry have been very effective in clouding people's judgments on the issue if you would like to learn as much as you can on how to make a strictly plant based fungi algae and bacteria products may be included diet please visit the following site http www veganhealth org sh there have been vegan olympic gold medalists and a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential http en wikipedia org wiki carl lewis http www eatright org cps rde xchg ada hs xsl advocacy enu html draft htm all of those things that you listed have animal free alternatives yogurt cultured soy cheese soy rice almond cashew and other cheeses all toiletries and personal hygiene products have vegan alternatives as well i would say that all products marketed by the likes of proctor gamble and unilever contain animal ingredients i should not ignore the fact that they conduct redundant and cruel tests on countless animals vegan implies that a person does everything within their ability within reason to eliminate animal based or related products from their lives a car or bicycle may have animal based glues or tire ingredients clothing may have animal based chemicals in the bleaching or dying process my computer may not be animal free and the first video recordings used as tools in our movement may have had gelatin in them these things are trivial when compared to what those products have done to allow us to function as parts of society and give our message everlasting media if our our uncertain future were to realize our goals in a few hundred or thousand years p all of the substances and methods that made those things non vegan would undoubtedly be eliminated this is my current edit on how to deal with parents while transitioning from a diet that includes flesh it always followed by the next entry that i have provided there is a japanese analogy proverb that goes like this the nail that sticks up is the one that gets hammered down people are like this everywhere when you tell your family that it is your personal belief that animals should not be eaten they take a look at themselves and it can be subconsciously translated into what you do is wrong and i choose to be right your parents have probably been taught a huge amount of misinformation by their parents and their teachers while growing up you really need to research vegetarian diets and health before you even think about saying the v word in front of your parents when you have gathered enough information and feel confident in a vegetarian diet's ability to maintain or even improve health you may mention to them that you have made the decision they may be shocked angry worried curious or many other things but you must never react to their behavior and always stay calm if they are able to speak to you and respect your choice please tell them everything and answer all questions if they are rude inconsiderate judgmental violent or verbally abusive refuse to continue any conversation until they can speak to you with respect the best advice is to study everything that you can about a healthy vegetarian diet and keep yourself in good shape better than most people your age or than your friends family if possible if nobody that you know shows a genuine positive interest in your choice don't give them the privilege of the knowledge that you have gathered work your way around any attempts they make to trivialize your beliefs and if possible go shopping with your parents and buy things that aren't obvious veggie fare instead of trying to sneak fake meat into the cart toss in lentil soup peanut butter pasta fruits veggies or anything else that you have learned is needed to fill any gaps in your diet this is my current edit on general transition information if you want to become a lacto ovo vegetarian the transition should be quite simple almost all meats have widely available commercial replacements all that you have to do is replace any flesh in your diet beef pork poultry seafood with meat analogs or just leave it out altogether you should keep in mind that a journey such as this can be quite short but should just be the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this is because of the reality of factory farming in which animals that are kept alive to produce milk eggs etc suffer much more and longer than animals that are raised to a certain weight and then slaughtered http www veganoutreach org whyvegan http meat org some people use the word vegan in reference to this idea but be aware that applying that label to yourself should always come with the inclusion of wise activism and advocacy http www veganoutreach org advocacy index html two extremely important examples of this are that you should never speak to someone about vegetarianism veganism without their consent and genuine interest or as a comment on what they are eating and your dietary beliefs should never be used as an introduction or explanation of who you are as a person veg ism should be something that comes up after people get to know you and they offer you a situation that makes it confusing to withhold the information discussion also if you are presented something that you choose not to eat or you are ordering food eating together somewhere picking the best place to eat when you you hold off on the subject until it's necessary and then act like it isn't a big deal at all people are usually surprised and way more interested and curious than if you were to bring it up when someone's eating or just using it as a conversation starter a responsible vegan always studies the subject of their own health and how to keep their body completely provided for in every sense http www veganhealth org sh to neglect their body is to define a plant based diet as unhealthy and is the opposite of helping the animals just to clear things up the vegetarian vegan diet is not composed of salads vegetables fruit and fake meat fruits and vegetables are always important but they do not make up the largest portion of any healthy diet a balanced plant based diet includes grains breads pasta rice cereal legumes soy beans peas lentils fruit and vegetables http www pcrm org health veginfo vsk food groups html http www peta org accidentallyvegan http www veganoutreach org whyvegan eating html being vegan can be an art one whose challenge is to take things that involve the suffering of the innocent and change them into something free of cruelty a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential technically the term vegetarian does imply that you don't consume anything that comes from the body of an animal that requires killing it many ingredients such as gelatin and glycerin are found in many candies fig newtons and many of other foods as well as rennet found in many cheeses http www happycow net health animal ingredients html the best thing to remember is to take your time so that for example when you are comfortable not eating beef and pork you can then give up chicken when you are sure you can make the commitment permanently depending on your age or reliance on parents or regional options it may not be best to give yourself a label the important thing is to do your best to make progress and be committed to your compassion towards animals never put your focus onto what you or other people use to describe yourself if you meet someone that talks down to people for eating meat dairy etc or to you because they think they are more veg than you laugh in their face and tell them they are a disgrace to the entire philosophy people like this only hurt the idea of veg ism and the animals the point of all of this is to live compassionately and and as free from cruelty as you can all the while maintaining your health and a positive attitude people who don't maintain either need not open their mouths and represent our beliefs if you actually choose to read all of this i hope it helps if not feel free to e mail me if you have questions this is my current edit of my favorite meals given as an idea of what can be included in a vegan diet if cooking skills are developed i'm vegan and these are some of my favorite things to eat breakfast bananas cream of wheat with brown sugar and soy butter cereal pancakes or french toast with real maple

i hate vegetables but i want to be vegetarian any ideas uhmm yeah eat your vegetables sorry but there is no way around it i am super glad that you want to go vegetarian but even if you were still eating meat you'd need to eat vegetables preferably servings a day not counting fries and ketchup think about it this way if you only eat junk food as a vegetarian you will definitely become sick people will see you and think all vegetarians are unhealthy it's important to be healthy and happy as a vegetarian people will be watching you closely to witness you fail if you want more people to become vegetarian with you the best way to show them it's the best way of life is to eat your veggies with a smile on your face and a clean bill of health  McDonald's Vegetarianism Hamburger Kashrut Hot dog Fish and chips Chinese cuisine Japanese cuisine Food guide pyramid MRE French fries Tofu Fast food Snack food Cat Food Buddhist cuisine Lisa the Vegetarian Sandwich French cuisine Dieting Egg (food) Ayyavazhi religious practices Burger Chili con carne Ketchup Atkins Nutritional Approach Barbecue Meat analogue Dim sum Vegetarian nutrition Korean cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Hamster Foodborne illness Domestic rabbit Cuisine of Denmark Animal rights Raw food diet Healthy eating Natural Hygiene Terri Schiavo Hindu Buddhism Environmental vegetarianism German cuisine People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Soul food Junk food Pizza Sausage Cuisine of Singapore Cuisine of Vietnam Cuisine of Laos Super Size Me Fasting Japanese tea ceremony Domesticated turkey Cheese Breakfast Chinese food therapy British cuisine Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Pork rind Manna Meat Street food Ramen Omega-3 fatty acid Punk ideology In-N-Out Burger Cuisine of the Southern United States Unclean animals MyPyramid Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of Brazil Fast-food restaurant Burger King Adolf Hitler's medical health Russian cuisine Jewish cuisine Culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Health insurance Bengali cuisine Cuisine of Africa Marmite Tomato Cat food Bratwurst Christian Vegetarian Association Ronald McDonald Culture of India Meal Coronary heart disease Didache Swedish cuisine

okay i am confused what type of 'fats' do vegetarians and vegans have to stay away from and can i consume can i consume products that say partially hydrogenated vegetable oil i've been a veggie for a month now and i try to eat vegan food too though i dont want to become one no offense however i'm having problems trying to figure out what type of fat is acceptable in food stuff and what is not please help me thanks very much vegetarians would not eat animal fats such as lard and vegans would not eat fat that comes from dairy or eggs whether it's hydrogenated or not has nothing to do with whether it is vegan or vegetarian only whether its source is from animals vegetable oil soybean oil coconut oil etc any oils that come from nuts and vegetables are both vegan and vegetarian regardless of how heavily processed they are hydrogenation and methods of processing can affect the nutritional value of the food but that's a different story  Veganism Vegetarianism Soybean Vegetarian cuisine Dieting Trans fat Vegetarian nutrition Food guide pyramid Kashrut Biodiesel Egg (food) Raw food diet Kosher foods Ice cream People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Cyanocobalamin Cooking oil Margarine Healthy eating Paleolithic diet Buddhist cuisine Cheese Vegetable oil Atkins Nutritional Approach MyPyramid Meat analogue Saturated fat Soy milk Taboo food and drink Cuisine of Malaysia Tocopherol Food preservation Environmental vegetarianism Vegetarianism and religion Dairy French cuisine Organic food Korean cuisine Protein Sausage Agriculture Fruitarianism Milk Peanut Flavouring Bengali cuisine French fries Animal rights Breakfast Gelatin Hydrogenation Energy development Genetically modified food Butter Fasting Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Bread Hamburger Cake Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Oily fish Alcohol fuel Hamster Peanut butter Chocolate Eating Pizza Lecithin Famine Low-carbohydrate diet Common bean Organic farming Economy of Romania Oil palm Acorn Quorn Thermal depolymerization Mayonnaise Nut (fruit) Polychlorinated biphenyl Guinea pig Brain Water Coconut Peruvian cuisine Livestock Potassium Prostate cancer Snack food Pancake

how do you actually and succesfully become a vegetarian at age forty is it better to change gradually or to simply ban all meat at once all input will be appreciated it's only too late if you're already dead forty sounds like the perfect age to become vegetarian if you're forty p you have your independence and don't have to listen to your parents tell you that you'll waste away without meat and if anyone else does you'll be too mature to even respond to their thoughtless comments the best way to do it is to study up on nutrition nothing major and start exploring vegetarian cuisine as you gradually eat less and less meat or types of meat it is as broad as traditional food choices and you will probably end up expanding the range of your diet there have been vegan olympic gold medalists and a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential http en wikipedia org wiki carl lewis http www eatright org cps rde xchg ada hs xsl advocacy enu html draft htm if you want to become a lacto ovo vegetarian the transition should be quite simple almost all meats have widely available commercial replacements all that you have to do is replace any flesh in your diet beef pork poultry seafood with meat analogs or just leave it out altogether you should keep in mind that a journey such as this can be quite short but should just be the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this is because of the reality of factory farming in which animals that are kept alive to produce milk eggs etc suffer much more and longer than animals that are raised to a certain weight and then slaughtered http www veganoutreach org whyvegan http meat org some people use the word vegan in reference to this idea but be aware that applying that label to yourself should always come with the inclusion of wise activism and advocacy http www veganoutreach org advocacy index html two extremely important examples of this are that you should never speak to someone about vegetarianism veganism without their consent and genuine interest or as a comment on what they are eating and your dietary beliefs should never be used as an introduction or explanation of who you are as a person veg ism should be something that comes up after people get to know you and they offer you a situation that makes it confusing to withhold the information discussion also if you are presented something that you choose not to eat or you are ordering food eating together somewhere picking the best place to eat when you you hold off on the subject until it's necessary and then act like it isn't a big deal at all people are usually surprised and way more interested and curious than if you were to bring it up when someone's eating or just using it as a conversation starter a responsible vegan always studies the subject of their own health and how to keep their body completely provided for in every sense http www veganhealth org sh to neglect their body is to define a plant based diet as unhealthy and is the opposite of helping the animals just to clear things up the vegetarian vegan diet is not composed of salads vegetables fruit and fake meat fruits and vegetables are always important but they do not make up the largest portion of any healthy diet a balanced plant based diet includes grains breads pasta rice cereal legumes soy beans peas lentils fruit and vegetables http www pcrm org health veginfo vsk food groups html http www peta org accidentallyvegan http www veganoutreach org whyvegan eating html being vegan can be an art one whose challenge is to take things that involve the suffering of the innocent and change them into something free of cruelty a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential technically the term vegetarian does imply that you don't consume anything that comes from the body of an animal that requires killing it many ingredients such as gelatin and glycerin are found in many candies fig newtons and many of other foods as well as rennet found in many cheeses http www happycow net health animal ingredients html the best thing to remember is to take your time so that for example when you are comfortable not eating beef and pork you can then give up chicken when you are sure you can make the commitment permanently depending on your age or reliance on parents or regional options it may not be best to give yourself a label the important thing is to do your best to make progress and be committed to your compassion towards animals never put your focus onto what you or other people use to describe yourself if you meet someone that talks down to people for eating meat dairy etc or to you because they think they are more veg than you laugh in their face and tell them they are a disgrace to the entire philosophy people like this only hurt the idea of veg ism and the animals the point of all of this is to live compassionately and and as free from cruelty as you can all the while maintaining your health and a positive attitude people who don't maintain either need not open their mouths and represent our beliefs if you actually choose to read all of this i hope it helps if not feel free to e mail me if you have questions i'm vegan and these are some of my favorite things to eat breakfast bananas cream of wheat with brown sugar and soy butter cereal pancakes or french toast with real maple syrup vegan sausage patties smoothies snack brussel sprouts no joke lunch vegan sausage sandwiches sandwiches with vegan deli slices tofurkey is the only one that's kinda funky fruit dinner leftovers couscous salad vegan sushi potato or pasta salad dinner sloppy joes sausage and gravy with homemade biscuits spaghetti and trader joe's meatballs or tvp lasagna thai pad see ew pad khi mao drunkard's noodles pad prig king tofu eggplant with basil sauce yellow thai curry with tofu or vegan chikn and veggies and jasmine rice indian dal with homemade roti or dosai channa masala aloo gobi vegetable or minestrone soup pizza steamed pork buns with potstickers or spring rolls sweet sour orange lemon chikn vegan pho or wonton soup baked tofu bbq homemade seitan tastes like meat from boiled bbq'd ribs i use these sites to find recipes http www foodnetwork com http vegweb com http www recipezaar com

'suitable for vegans' are some things in the uk suitable for vegans even if they don't say it on the packaging also if it says 'may contain traces of milk' but doesn't have milk in the ingredients list does this mean they actually have been prepared with milk or that they just so happen to have milk in the same factory i'm assuming if it was prepared with milk then it would say this in the ingrediets right yep plenty of pre packaged things are vegan but don't say so on the packaging don't know what part of the uk you're in but euroshopper never says suitable for vegans on the packaging that i've ever seen even if the ingredients for corn tortillas for example are just corn and salt just have to read ingredients and use common sense on some products same with the traces of milk thing it's just an allergy religious warning from being made in the same factory or on the same conveyor belt on a different day after being washed down i actually use the traces of milk warning to tell if breakfast cereals are vegan or not if it has the allergy warning stated like that i at least know there isn't milk product in the product otherwise it says contains milk ingredients  Veganism Food Vegetarianism Dairy Kosher foods Tofu Breakfast Soy milk Soybean Bread Cheese Pizza Vegetarian cuisine Breakfast cereal Ice cream Flour Porridge Pancake Milk Tortilla Chocolate Coffee Sausage Cuisine of Brazil Rice pudding Sushi Peanut Muesli Rice Nestl__ Egg (food) Organic food Fecal incontinence Bengali cuisine Pop-Tarts Oreo Gluten-free diet Cuisine of Africa Food allergy Maize Soul food Cuisine of Denmark Ammonia Starch Milkshake Peruvian cuisine Jewish cuisine Soy protein Cuisine of the Philippines Leather Tea Gluten Polish cuisine Ovaltine Corn flakes Cereal Sugar beet Idli Cuisine of Singapore Honey Dieting Soap French cuisine Infant formula Food preservation Curry Cadbury Schweppes Biscuit Cuisine of Malaysia Cake Hong Kong-style milk tea Margarine Philosophical skepticism Theory of conduct Kitchen German cuisine Chicken M__m__lig__ Diarrhea Sorghum Chili con carne Nestl__ Nesquik Little Britain Breastfeeding Taco Natt__ Kraft Dinner Lactose intolerance Cuisine of the Southern United States Rice Krispies Dairy farming Organic farming Full English breakfast Futurama (TV series - season 2) Post office

vegans what made you become a vegan do you like your food and are you well on your diet i don't believe that anything should have to suffer for me and i don't think that people have a right to interfere with animals' lives for their own personal gain anyway i have been vegan for four years and now i feel like i've been vegan my whole life there have been vegan olympic gold medalists and a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential http en wikipedia org wiki carl lewis http www eatright org cps rde xchg ada hs xsl advocacy enu html draft htm i'm vegan and these are some of my favorite things to eat breakfast bananas cream of wheat with brown sugar and soy butter cereal pancakes or french toast with real maple syrup vegan sausage patties smoothies snack brussel sprouts no joke lunch vegan sausage sandwiches sandwiches with vegan deli slices tofurkey is the only one that's kinda funky fruit dinner leftovers couscous salad vegan sushi potato or pasta salad dinner sloppy joes sausage and gravy with homemade biscuits spaghetti and trader joe's meatballs or tvp lasagna thai pad see ew pad khi mao drunkard's noodles pad prig king tofu eggplant with basil sauce yellow thai curry with tofu or vegan chikn and veggies and jasmine rice indian dal with homemade roti or dosai channa masala aloo gobi vegetable or minestrone soup pizza steamed pork buns with potstickers or spring rolls sweet sour orange lemon chikn vegan pho or wonton soup baked tofu bbq homemade seitan tastes like meat from boiled bbq'd ribs i use these sites to find recipes http www foodnetwork com http vegweb com http www recipezaar com if you want to become a lacto ovo vegetarian the transition should be quite simple almost all meats have widely available commercial replacements all that you have to do is replace any flesh in your diet beef pork poultry seafood with meat analogs or just leave it out altogether you should keep in mind that a journey such as this can be quite short but should just be the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this is because of the reality of factory farming in which animals that are kept alive to produce milk eggs etc suffer much more and longer than animals that are raised to a certain weight and then slaughtered http www veganoutreach org whyvegan http meat org some people use the word vegan in reference to this idea but be aware that applying that label to yourself should always come with the inclusion of wise activism and advocacy http www veganoutreach org advocacy index html two extremely important examples of this are that you should never speak to someone about vegetarianism veganism without their consent and genuine interest or as a comment on what they are eating and your dietary beliefs should never be used as an introduction or explanation of who you are as a person veg ism should be something that comes up after people get to know you and they offer you a situation that makes it confusing to withhold the information discussion also if you are presented something that you choose not to eat or you are ordering food eating together somewhere picking the best place to eat when you you hold off on the subject until it's necessary and then act like it isn't a big deal at all people are usually surprised and way more interested and curious than if you were to bring it up when someone's eating or just using it as a conversation starter a responsible vegan always studies the subject of their own health and how to keep their body completely provided for in every sense http www veganhealth org sh to neglect their body is to define a plant based diet as unhealthy and is the opposite of helping the animals just to clear things up the vegetarian vegan diet is not composed of salads vegetables fruit and fake meat fruits and vegetables are always important but they do not make up the largest portion of any healthy diet a balanced plant based diet includes grains breads pasta rice cereal legumes soy beans peas lentils fruit and vegetables http www pcrm org health veginfo vsk food groups html http www peta org accidentallyvegan http www veganoutreach org whyvegan eating html being vegan can be an art one whose challenge is to take things that involve the suffering of the innocent and change them into something free of cruelty a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential technically the term vegetarian does imply that you don't consume anything that comes from the body of an animal that requires killing it many ingredients such as gelatin and glycerin are found in many candies fig newtons and many of other foods as well as rennet found in many cheeses http www happycow net health animal ingredients html the best thing to remember is to take your time so that for example when you are comfortable not eating beef and pork you can then give up chicken when you are sure you can make the commitment permanently depending on your age or reliance on parents or regional options it may not be best to give yourself a label the important thing is to do your best to make progress and be committed to your compassion towards animals never put your focus onto what you or other people use to describe yourself if you meet someone that talks down to people for eating meat dairy etc or to you because they think they are more veg than you laugh in their face and tell them they are a disgrace to the entire philosophy people like this only hurt the idea of veg ism and the animals the point of all of this is to live compassionately and and as free from cruelty as you can all the while maintaining your health and a positive attitude people who don't maintain either need not open their mouths and represent our beliefs if you actually choose to read all of this i hope it helps if not feel free to e mail me if you have questions

raw foodists i am starting a raw food lifestyle today any tips on sprouting this sounds weird to me can't i just buy things already sprouted sprouting is a fun hobby i sprout fenungreek chia peas lentils brocolli clover radish alfalfa sunflower and all sorts of other sprouts on a daily basis i rotate my trays so i have a fresh supply every day you wont find many sprouted items at your local grocery store thats for sure my favorite sprouter is kitchen crop brand although i use several methods including just a mason jar covered with clean pantyhose its fun to watch the sprouts progress so quickly i can sprout them one day and eat them the next in most cases but by keeping the trays rotated daily i can let some of them sprout for a little longer which changes the texture of the sprout young sprouts days are really tender day sprouts hold up better in wraps salads etc its worth the little effort to do it yourself be sure to rinse the sprouts daily and discard the rinse water it contains anarobic bacteria that produce as the sprouts grow i use the rinse water for my houseplants but dont consume it directly good luck i keep about percent raw percent cooked or lightly steamed it makes it easier to manage and that way i can still use condiments such as vinegar etc  Sprouting Tofu Cuisine of Denmark Hot dog Fish and chips Dairy Food Sauerkraut Vinegar Escherichia coli O157:H7 Japanese cuisine Alfalfa Hamburger Bread Cantonese cuisine Plastic Idli Bengali cuisine Tea Domestic rabbit Dishwasher Sushi Cuisine of the Philippines Potato Jewish cuisine Cannabis cultivation Domesticated turkey Raw food diet Bean Cheese Agriculture Organic food Banana Salad Foodborne illness Acetic acid Fugu Japanese tea ceremony Cuisine of Laos Kosher foods Mattress French cuisine French fries Chopsticks Hydroponics Houseplant Breakfast Barbecue Vegetarianism Kitchen Common bean Waste management Veganism Cuisine of Malaysia Ramen Mayonnaise Korean cuisine Tobacco Hay Sears Holdings Corporation Pickling Sausage Broccoli Cuisine of Brazil Guinea pig Hamster Fluoride therapy Seed Apple Egg (food) Chili con carne Vitamin C Soba RuneScape skills Milk Halitosis Menstrual cup Sugar beet Roman eating and drinking German cuisine Ham D__ner kebab McDonald's Weed Cuisine of Singapore Inventory Tlingit Chocolate Wok Delicatessen Local food Chicken

cruelty free toothpaste that doesn't taste like blah okay so i've spent about on various cruelty free toothpastes and all of them taste like either nothing or like some sort of putrid hand lotion or something i don't even care if it's vegan i just want to find one that hasn't been tested on animals and doesn't contain non vegetarian animal ingredients i thought that at least one of the national brands would not test on animals but so far i haven't found it peta's compassionate shopper list says that oral b currently has a moratorium on testing they aren't doing it on a temporary basis hopefully to become permanent but i've not been able to find adult toothpaste from them just kids stuff that's like berry flavored or bubblegum flavored i just want a normal mint type toothpaste that actually makes my mouth feel like i just brushed it am i on a wild goosechase thanks everyone for your suggestions so far i've tried tom's flavors and don't care for them but i'll try some others as well tried jason and didn't like it but might try it again now that i'm not used to colgate etc anymore where would i find the nature's gate one i'll check again at the co op but don't remember seeing it there dailest's answer is inaccurate all toothpastes are not cruelty free far from it i like tom's of maine toothpaste in peppermint i also tried the spearmint flavor but didn't like it but i really like the peppermint if you've already tried tom's in a flavor other than peppermint and didn't like it i'd recommend trying the peppermint you might find it less objectionable tom's is cruelty free although the company was recently purchased by colgate which is not cruelty free however colgate has agreed to maintain the cruelty free policy when it comes to all tom's branded products so they are safe some people believe and i respect this opinion that even if tom's brand products are cruelty free you still shouldn't buy them since its parent company colgate does test its other products on animals my personal feeling is that it is ok to buy tom's and other cruelty free products that are produced by parent companies that are not cruelty free such as body shop which is now owned by loreal because you're still not supporting testing and you're sending a message to the parent company with every purchase that you will only buy cruelty free but that's an issue you'll have to consider for yourself  Toothpaste People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Veganism Animal rights Kashrut Halitosis Tooth Theory of conduct Ethical consumerism Vegetarianism Little Britain Procter & Gamble Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Animal Liberation Front Colgate-Palmolive The Apprentice 2 Stomach cancer Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Motion picture rating system Egg (food) Prostate cancer Sugar substitute Plame affair Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Animal testing Wall Street Foie gras 2004 Republican National Convention Dog Mint Neopets Menthol Past teachings of Prem Rawat Divorce Infantilism American Red Cross Advertising Microeconomics Economics Essential oil Organic food Tobacco Peter Singer The Death Gate Cycle Tofu Fecal incontinence Cruelty to animals Altoids Aspartame LiveJournal Listerine Contract Sears Holdings Corporation Tattoo Food Upholstery Theodicy Flavouring Surveillance OK Soda Ramen Libertarianism Inca Kola Hypoglycemia Fathers' rights Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Philosophical skepticism The Amber Spyglass Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) Fluoride therapy Pet skunk Avenue Q Rum Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Honey Coca-Cola Cigarette 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Cat McDonald's Coffee Capital punishment Annuity Chewing gum Brewery Cigar Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Animal welfare Cancer Gross domestic product Software engineering Kurt Cobain Futurama (TV series - season 5) Jumpstart 3rd Grade Prolog Episodes of Lost (Season 1)

is it wrong to eat meat replicas think about it would you want someone eating a meat replacement for human flesh i think we as vegans should stop eating garden burgers simply because of what they represent they represent a slaughtered cow and i think that is wrong to even try to imitate eating dead animals oh my god ashley you are an absolute id ot phew sorry but you really are annoying the hell out of me with all your stupid questions a vegan burger doesn't represent a slaughtered cow it represents food and it shows that we can still enjoy tasty things which meat eaters do without causing any suffering to animals if anything we should buy more of this food to support the companies which make them that way they will become more popular and might actually be able to sway a meat eater into considering a vegetarian vegan diet surely it would be better if there were less meat burgers on the supermarket shelves and more veg ones and to answer your question yes i would love someone eating a meat replacement for human flesh as long as it wasn't actual flesh i'm sure we're not hurting any animals' feelings it's not like they look at a veggie burger and think that's a me subsitute if they did think this i'm sure they would have more sense than you and would probably deduce that it's better these products exists if they're keeping happy those that don't choose to consume their flesh vegan burgers don't represent death they represent a choice we have made for life that's just like saying we shouldn't eat animal shaped biscuits or a carrot that just so happens to look like a squid or the head of a horse grow up ashley and stop giving us a bad name  Veganism Vegetarianism Hamburger Kashrut Vegetarian cuisine Animal rights Meat People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Taboo food and drink Vegetarianism and religion Peter Singer Burger King Kosher foods Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Original sin Food Theory of conduct Cat Theodicy Buddhist cuisine Burger Livestock Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Dieting Animal Liberation Front Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an In-N-Out Burger Tofu Unclean animals Goodness and value theory Shark Meat analogue Sausage Homer Simpson Fiddler on the Roof Buddhism Factory farming MRE Carnivore Slaughterhouse Environmental vegetarianism Horse meat 613 mitzvot Punk ideology McDonald's Chicken Vegetarian nutrition Meat Loaf Japanese cuisine Utilitarianism Cattle Philosophical skepticism God Simone Weil The nature of God in Western theology Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Orca The Amber Spyglass Soybean Sperm Whale Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Soul Cuisine of Denmark Mortification of the flesh Cassava Abrahamic religion Whaling Pitaten Meaning of life Jewish cuisine French cuisine British cuisine Healthy eating Hindu Hard-line Organic food Domestic rabbit Christian eschatology Adam and Eve Bill Maher YuYu Hakusho Michel Henry Sin City Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Ethical consumerism Shit Singlish Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Gray Wolf Guinea pig Cannibalism Food guide pyramid

could a person survive on vegetable juices alone as we all know a vegan diet is the most healthiest diet to follow i am thinking of just drinking vetable juices because i want to give my digestive tract a rest also i don't like the idea of carrying around to pounds of feces in my body all day it just grosses me out to think about it if i drank only juice i wouldn't have any waste in my body my body would be pure harry d that is juicearian not juicetarian lol must be all that meat you are eating i just can't believe some of the replies i am reading no offense most of you people are like the blind leading the blind you go on and on about protein you people just follow the masses without question i laugh at your stupidity i really do arthur r do not reply to my questions anymore i have reported you to yahoo please stop stalking me you freak q a str away i can not believe you typed the word anus i have so reported you you are a perv q a str away einstein was a vegan and he was the smartest man ever http www articlepress org articledetail php artid catid title vegetable juice detox tips and recipe ideas have a read of this article it states that a vegetable juice diet is for detox reasons only and people should not solely have this diet for more than a week just drinking veg and fruit juices for a week will completely clean out your digestive system but extending this can be detrimental to your health i would suggest that if you want to survive on a diet of veg and fruit juice that you do thorough research into this as i have found nothing on the internet that supports this sort of diet long term you keep slating people for going on about protein but even you should know that a balanced diet is a sensible diet protein is an essential nutrient for cell maintenance and repair and regulation of a wide range of bodily functions how much protein we need to eat in our diet usually depends on our ideal body weight ideal body weight is used because amino acids are not needed by fat cells only by our lean body mass you choose not to get your protein from meat that's fine but your body still needs it and it can be found in a variety of vegan foods i really think that it is time you sat down and actually did some proper research in the vegan diet and your body and it's basic needs no i'm not a vegan and never will be but from q a's on this subject the majority of vegans are very sensible about their diet and ensure that they follow their chosen diet in a sensible way to ensure they are healthy whilst being vegan is very admirable your hardline view of what you think you should be doing is very ignorant and will only send you to an early grave i suggest some proper research  Protein Folic acid Food Guinea pig Atkins Nutritional Approach Vegetarian nutrition Hypoglycemia Healthy eating Milk Omega-3 fatty acid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Obesity Insulin Nutrient Dog Prostate cancer Cancer Cat Cheese Coeliac disease Low-carbohydrate diet Egg (food) Fasting Soybean Coronary heart disease Super Size Me Stomach cancer Adjustable gastric band Fecal incontinence Chocolate Food guide pyramid Blood Dietary fiber Trans fat Vitamin Animal rights South Beach diet Tofu Water Weight training Dairy Cystic fibrosis Kashrut Breastfeeding Fruitarianism Agriculture Person MyPyramid Apoptosis Cell (biology) Gastrointestinal tract Puberty Sugar substitute Potassium Sugar Cyanocobalamin Simone Weil Enzyme Biology Ferret Tooth enamel Ecology Brain Kosher foods Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tomato Environmental vegetarianism Senescence Japanese tea ceremony Carnivorous plant Ayurveda Gelatin Chlorophyta Chronic fatigue syndrome Taboo food and drink Acorn Human height Soy milk Protein sequencing Colorectal cancer Hamster Liver Aztec Internet troll Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder

vegetarian chef my very young son has expressed an interest in becoming a chef however he is a vegetarian he was watching top chef today and saw the contestants digging out clams etc and cooking lamb and pork he said how can i become a chef if i don't want to cook meat i said i really don't have any idea about that i'll ask on yahoo answers he smiled real big so anyone have feedback for him someone ask a few questions so here are some answers i have been a vegetarian on and off during my life i am not at the moment my kids refer to it as if i have embarrassingly fallen off the wagon none of my children have ever tasted meat and i can't imagine that this son would ever be willing to cook meat even fish nothing with eyes except potatoes my son always helps me cook and is great with flexibility and adaption he is a very creative little guy thanks for all your answers i told him i had posted and he was really excited to the poster talking about texas it is true we are sort of an oddity in new braunfels but he actually has several vegetarian friends it is possible here one just has to be a little flexible a decade ago i would have screamed over refried beans whose ingredients i wasn't sure about but these days are different thanks to everyone for their fabulous contributions i'm assuming you aren't veg how young is very young pre school high school he needs to start out by learning how to cook in your kitchen are you teaching him cooking as a veg he needs to know how to cook anyway as an important survival skill for living veg in texas g if he's old enough to read get him a fannie farmer cookbook and also a copy of the new farm vegetarian cookbook fannie will get him familiar with all the basics of cooking the farm will get both of you familiar with 'down home' veg cookery the skills he builds now will help him later on whether or not he sticks with the idea of being a chef his options for 'professional' schooling in texas are limited esp since it seems y'all are around new braunfels but don't sweat that if he's already a good cook by the time he's ready to work in a restaurant or better yet start his own g not having that piece of paper won't matter this next part is going to get me slammed but it really is important for coping in a meatish industry and world sigh but it's important because the most successful veg restaurants are the ones that attract more than just the veg market knowing what and how omni's eat are important skills arg he won't like it i sure didn't but he does at some point need to be familiar with cooking carrion animals no need to start with it and he most certainly does not need to taste it if he learns what goes into cooking the stuff and pays attention to what it looks and smells like he won't have to taste it to know when it's done 'correctly' cooked animals are never correct but you get the idea i hope g but it'll also teach him to cook by feel which is a skill that school trained chefs almost never develop it's an instant edge over anyone else in a kitchen and classmates if he does eventually go to culinary school one other thing if he's old enough drag him over to one of those two decent veg friendly health food stores in town g they've got a lot of the ingredients you need to do good veg cooking edit to the folks upset that i suggest teaching the kid about carrion this family is in texas not oregon california new york new hampshire united kingdom or any other relatively veg friendly place and they aren't even in houston dallas or austin the best of the worst in an anti veg state this boy is growing up in an area where meat is ubiquitous and if he learns about how it's cooked he'll never be put in the spot of having to taste the dreck to know it's prepared the way some omni wants it cooked it's a matter of knowing your 'enemy' and not selling out edit it is much easier to be a 'tex veg' than when i was a kid and nowhere near as odd g you can avoid the 'tex mex' problems by heading up to casa de luz in austin even though that does mean fighting i lol and call ahead they might be willing to talk to him a bit about running a veg restaurant in texas or at least show off the kitchen since he's already helping out in the kitchen work him up to leading in the kitchen that also gets you a break from the kitchen g drag him to the library for cookbooks and n b s used bookstore book in time if it's still there for cookbooks also abebooks com or amazon once he gets the option he should take home ec in school good way to meet girls too g when he hits his teens he should also start taking business and marketing courses most chefs never develop business and marketing skills and that's a big part of why most restaurants fail within years  Chili con carne Barbecue Vegetarianism Shaggy dog story Cajun cuisine Veganism Kitchen Food Sushi Cuisine of Denmark Tofu Iron Chef Cuisine of Brazil French fries Friends Milton H.

why is it that it seems that emos and goths and blonds are vegans and vegetarians just look around you look at there avatars and in real life look at them ever get the feeling that vegetarians consider themselves morally superior to you like they think that not eating meat makes them so special that their shit doesn't stink as if when someone stops eating meat they suddenly become holy and dignified and it excuses them for the years of inconvenience and frustration they inevitably inflict upon their friends family and co workers who just want to go to a restaurant and order a damn steak without constantly being reminded that they're going to hell for eating an animal that spends most of its life shitting in a field and how do you not eat eggs and drink milk those types of things dont even hurt the animal why did the emo dude answer this hippies to and give me some proof that it hurts the animal your just bitching about vegetarians no one cares about them  Vegetarianism Veganism Shit Vegetarian cuisine Hamburger Buddhist cuisine Kashrut Animal rights Taboo food and drink Punk ideology Buddhism Kyle Broflovski People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Dim sum Meat analogue The Marshall Mathers LP Kosher foods Emo Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Tofu Meat German cuisine Pitaten Cuisine of Denmark Recurring South Park characters Vegetarianism and religion Chicken Peter Singer Dieting Camp Lazlo Theory of conduct Trailer Park Boys 613 mitzvot Euphemism Hindu The Smoking Room French cuisine Sausage Food Breakfast Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Kodocha Jimmy Eat World Vegetarian nutrition Questionable Content Something Positive Hip hop rivalries Cuisine of Brazil Boom Town (Doctor Who) Chili con carne Friends Korean cuisine Stone Cold Steve Austin Matt Hardy Unclean animals Animal Liberation Front Environmental vegetarianism Steak Past teachings of Prem Rawat Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Whaling Chinese cuisine Didache Cuisine of the Philippines Jackass: The Movie Chappelle's Show Guinea pig McDonald's True Crime: Streets of LA Blood (computer game) Pizza Russian cuisine Phoebe Buffay God Piccolo Junior Saga Pancake Cheese British cuisine Raw food diet Cat Nothing Nice To Say Fasting Marie Antoinette Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Atomic Kitten Simone Weil Eric Cartman Tooth Halaal Straight edge Cuisine of Singapore Shaggy dog story Wizards (film) Christian anarchism YuYu Hakusho Escherichia coli O157:H7 Fiddler on the Roof

question about vegan preferences i was listening to dr dean edell this afternoon and he was talking about a survey taken regarding vegans' sexual preferences according to the survey many vegans will not date or sleep with meat eaters as they consider it disgusting and distasteful to even kiss a non vegan some even refuse to associate with non vegans i find this an extreme point of view i was curious to know how vegans here feel about this and why i am sincerely interested in your opinions thanks everyone for your input i guess i can understand why a vegan would feel this way it's much easier to have a relationship with someone who shares your values i appreciate your honesty thanks connie for sending me to that article it sounds like the exact study that dr dean was talking about very enlightening first you might want to read the research greenghost did and received best answer for on that same article http answers yahoo com question index ylt ajua joyheqyjdvizz cyltty ix qid aaeltti show profile info bvrvyhtaa it goes into the bias and flaws of the article that being said as i vegan i can only say that for me to be with someone on a regular basis not just omni friends or relatives but specifically someone you want to have a relationship with i would not be able to since i believe eating meat is wrong how do i look at my partner everyday and act like it is fine to me what they do i would be thinking of all the animals they killed and it could never work i know it does work for some people so perhaps it is because i am older and more set in my ways  Veganism Sexual orientation Child sexuality Animal rights Vegetarianism Plame affair Zoophilia Hard-line Homophobia Human sexual behavior Infantilism Parapsychology Raw food diet Theory of conduct Peter Singer Cultural relativism Judaism EastEnders Asperger syndrome Second language acquisition 613 mitzvot Psychology Socrates Ethics Franz Boas Theodicy Dieting Philosophy Age of the Earth Goodness and value theory Sigmund Freud A Course In Miracles Autism Domestic violence Animal Liberation Front English grammar Borderline personality disorder Bisexuality Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Child sexual abuse Economics Philosophy of language Punk ideology Extreme Programming Human Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Polyamory Koan Hey Jude Internet troll Ecology One Tree Hill (TV series) Abstraction (computer science) Mojave people Scientific method Egg (food) Labor theory of value Avenue Q Whaling Social psychology Meaning of life Law of value Friends Biology and sexual orientation Kurt Cobain Prices of production Kashrut Social rule HTTP cookie Expert system Taoism Negima George Lakoff Carl Jung Database Divorce Statistical survey Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Cult Buddhist cuisine Consensus decision-making GED Bernard Williams Cindy Sheehan Journalism ethics and standards Object-oriented programming Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Buddhism Creation-evolution controversy Mathematics People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Yusuf al-Qaradawi Zen The writing of Principia Mathematica The relationship between religion and science Food guide pyramid Transsexuality Deconstruction Ginny Weasley Normal distribution

vegan and vegetarian wats the differencce between em vegetarians do not eat meat for various reasons health animal cruelty the environment religion vegan people believe that animals have their own lives and that we have no right to interfere with them to serve own needs or desires we do not eat anything from animals sources meat milk eggs honey or use anything within our ability to avoid within reason that is available due to the exploitation of animals leather wool feathers down silk there have been vegan olympic gold medalists and a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential http en wikipedia org wiki carl lewis http www eatright org cps rde xchg ada hs xsl advocacy enu html draft htm if you want to become a lacto ovo vegetarian the transition should be quite simple almost all meats have widely available commercial replacements all that you have to do is replace any flesh in your diet beef pork poultry seafood with meat analogs or just leave it out altogether you should keep in mind that a journey such as this can be quite short but should just be the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this is because of the reality of factory farming in which animals that are kept alive to produce milk eggs etc suffer much more and longer than animals that are raised to a certain weight and then slaughtered http www veganoutreach org whyvegan http meat org some people use the word vegan in reference to this idea but be aware that applying that label to yourself should always come with the inclusion of wise activism and advocacy http www veganoutreach org advocacy index html two extremely important examples of this are that you should never speak to someone about vegetarianism veganism without their consent and genuine interest or as a comment on what they are eating and your dietary beliefs should never be used as an introduction or explanation of who you are as a person veg ism should be something that comes up after people get to know you and they offer you a situation that makes it confusing to withhold the information discussion also if you are presented something that you choose not to eat or you are ordering food eating together somewhere picking the best place to eat when you you hold off on the subject until it's necessary and then act like it isn't a big deal at all people are usually surprised and way more interested and curious than if you were to bring it up when someone's eating or just using it as a conversation starter a responsible vegan always studies the subject of their own health and how to keep their body completely provided for in every sense http www veganhealth org sh to neglect their body is to define a plant based diet as unhealthy and is the opposite of helping the animals just to clear things up the vegetarian vegan diet is not composed of salads vegetables fruit and fake meat fruits and vegetables are always important but they do not make up the largest portion of any healthy diet a balanced plant based diet includes grains breads pasta rice cereal legumes soy beans peas lentils fruit and vegetables http www pcrm org health veginfo vsk food groups html http www peta org accidentallyvegan http www veganoutreach org whyvegan eating html being vegan can be an art one whose challenge is to take things that involve the suffering of the innocent and change them into something free of cruelty a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential technically the term vegetarian does imply that you don't consume anything that comes from the body of an animal that requires killing it many ingredients such as gelatin and glycerin are found in many candies fig newtons and many of other foods as well as rennet found in many cheeses http www happycow net health animal ingredients html the best thing to remember is to take your time so that for example when you are comfortable not eating beef and pork you can then give up chicken when you are sure you can make the commitment permanently depending on your age or reliance on parents or regional options it may not be best to give yourself a label the important thing is to do your best to make progress and be committed to your compassion towards animals never put your focus onto what you or other people use to describe yourself if you meet someone that talks down to people for eating meat dairy etc or to you because they think they are more veg than you laugh in their face and tell them they are a disgrace to the entire philosophy people like this only hurt the idea of veg ism and the animals the point of all of this is to live compassionately and and as free from cruelty as you can all the while maintaining your health and a positive attitude people who don't maintain either need not open their mouths and represent our beliefs if you actually choose to read all of this i hope it helps if not feel free to e mail me if you have questions i'm vegan and these are some of my favorite things to eat breakfast bananas cream of wheat with brown sugar and soy butter cereal pancakes or french toast with real maple syrup vegan sausage patties smoothies lunch vegan sausage sandwiches sandwiches with vegan deli slices tofurkey is the only one that's kinda funky fruit dinner leftovers couscous salad vegan sushi potato or pasta

a question for vegans and others who find eating animals cruel first of all i just want to say i understand in america and other well off countries they produce meat and dairy products in huge commercialized amounts and from this most of the animals are not treated properly is it still wrong if you eat animals that were treated good i've read peta's website and nutritional reasoning as to why we shouldn't consume meat and dairy humans have been eating meat and dairy for hundreds of years so it seems unhealthy to me to suddenly take something away that has been part of our diet for so long you can look around the world and see there are places people live where if they didn't eat fish or meat they would die from starvation in colder climates and extremely hot climates it's nearly impossible to get enough different kinds of non animal foods to survive from not to mention human babies die if fed on a strict vegan diet what would you give the starving people in africa to eat only fruits and veggies i don't think so all kinds of foods can be contaminated you still have to wash off fruits and vegetables just like you would fresh meat in other parts of the country and in history people have eaten plenty of fish and meat and have never been obese it's the current methods of eating them like frying them in oil and loading them with sauces that's making people obese and unhealthy not the actual food in the definition of a vegan you do not consume animal products of any kind i don't know about you guys but a baby not being able to drink it's mothers own milk is what i call starving to death first of all my experience is that different people benefit from different type of diet i for example am native american i find i do very well indeed on fresh meat and vegetables plenty of seafood my people are fishermen and i thrive on lobster and other shellfish such as mussels and clams i consume two or three servings of raw organic dairy products every day of my life these foods have been consumed by the indigenous peoples for hundreds of years as a people we are healthy beautiful and well appointed well formed my husband does really well on fish with a few potatoes and a bit of salad thrown in he has a bad reaction to yeast and dairy products all except yoghurt he's allergic to bananas as i am probably because bananas don't grow in the areas where our people originated northern us canada for me iowa norway and sweden for him our bodies are very different also he is covered all over with a fine soft hair and i am virtually hairless except on my scalp eyebrows and lashes and pubic areas where the hair is very fine and silky although reasonably dense my personal use of the peta initials is as follows people eating tasty animals sorry if that's offensive that's just the way i feel i'm always fascinated about vegetarians and vegans who are in favor of choice a k a aborticide or fetal murder if you prefer i guess it's okay with those particular peta members if people treat humans badly as long as the treatment of animals is humane don't get me wrong i'm all in favor of treating animals ethically i have five cats four neutered males and one spayed female because i don't want unplanned kittens if people got spayed or neutered more often we'd have more ethical treatment of humans and animals because fewer unplanned kittens okay i probably didn't answer all your questions but i hope i was somewhat helpful best wishes to all  Animal rights Domestic rabbit Dieting Tofu McDonald's Breakfast Taboo food and drink Cuisine of Brazil Egg (food) Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of Denmark Milk Korean cuisine Raw food diet Kosher foods Cuisine of Africa Peruvian cuisine Vegetarian cuisine Dog Cuisine of the Philippines Vegetarianism and religion Pizza Bengali cuisine Atkins Nutritional Approach French cuisine Hamburger Nutrition Foodborne illness Soybean Peter Singer Fish and chips Fast food French fries Cuisine of Singapore Chocolate Pet skunk Omega-3 fatty acid Meat analogue Food guide pyramid Organic food Coronary heart disease Theory of conduct Organic farming Cheese Cajun cuisine Fecal incontinence Fishing Agriculture Japanese cuisine Breastfeeding Fancy rat 613 mitzvot Meat Cuisine of Laos Abortion debate Domesticated turkey Stomach cancer Domestic goat Potato Roman eating and drinking Feral cat Vegetarian nutrition Trans fat Halaal Vitamin C Fugu Bread Environmental vegetarianism Ferret Chicken Genetically modified food Factory farming Prostate cancer Insulin Kitten Cyanocobalamin Escherichia coli O157:H7 Soy milk Agriculture in Australia Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Jewish cuisine Salad Paleolithic diet Sausage Soup

newbie vegetarian here looking for guidance i am new haven't even started yet being a vegetarian i am seeking free informative websites that cater to the newbie like myself a google search pulls up far too many to weed through can anyone give me one or two or so to help get me going i need the very basics thanks if you want to become a lacto ovo vegetarian the transition should be quite simple almost all meats have widely available commercial replacements all that you have to do is replace any flesh in your diet beef pork poultry seafood with meat analogs or just leave it out altogether you should keep in mind that a journey such as this can be quite short but should just be the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this is because of the reality of factory farming in which animals that are kept alive to produce milk eggs etc suffer much more and longer than animals that are raised to a certain weight and then slaughtered http www veganoutreach org whyvegan http meat org some people use the word vegan in reference to this idea but be aware that applying that label to yourself should always come with the inclusion of wise activism and advocacy http www veganoutreach org advocacy index html two extremely important examples of this are that you should never speak to someone about vegetarianism veganism without their consent and genuine interest or as a comment on what they are eating and your dietary beliefs should never be used as an introduction or explanation of who you are as a person veg ism should be something that comes up after people get to know you and they offer you a situation that makes it confusing to withhold the information discussion also if you are presented something that you choose not to eat or you are ordering food eating together somewhere picking the best place to eat when you you hold off on the subject until it's necessary and then act like it isn't a big deal at all people are usually surprised and way more interested and curious than if you were to bring it up when someone's eating or just using it as a conversation starter a responsible vegan always studies the subject of their own health and how to keep their body completely provided for in every sense http www veganhealth org sh to neglect their body is to define a plant based diet as unhealthy and is the opposite of helping the animals just to clear things up the vegetarian vegan diet is not composed of salads vegetables fruit and fake meat fruits and vegetables are always important but they do not make up the largest portion of any healthy diet a balanced plant based diet includes grains breads pasta rice cereal legumes soy beans peas lentils fruit and vegetables http www pcrm org health veginfo vsk food groups html http www peta org accidentallyvegan http www veganoutreach org whyvegan eating html being vegan can be an art one whose challenge is to take things that involve the suffering of the innocent and change them into something free of cruelty a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential technically the term vegetarian does imply that you don't consume anything that comes from the body of an animal that requires killing it many ingredients such as gelatin and glycerin are found in many candies fig newtons and many of other foods as well as rennet found in many cheeses http www happycow net health animal ingredients html the best thing to remember is to take your time so that for example when you are comfortable not eating beef and pork you can then give up chicken when you are sure you can make the commitment permanently depending on your age or reliance on parents or regional options it may not be best to give yourself a label the important thing is to do your best to make progress and be committed to your compassion towards animals never put your focus onto what you or other people use to describe yourself if you meet someone that talks down to people for eating meat dairy etc or to you because they think they are more veg than you laugh in their face and tell them they are a disgrace to the entire philosophy people like this only hurt the idea of veg ism and the animals the point of all of this is to live compassionately and and as free from cruelty as you can all the while maintaining your health and a positive attitude people who don't maintain either need not open their mouths and represent our beliefs if you actually choose to read all of this i hope it helps if not feel free to e mail me if you have questions i'm vegan and these are some of my favorite things to eat breakfast bananas cream of wheat with brown sugar and soy butter cereal pancakes or french toast with real maple syrup vegan sausage patties smoothies lunch vegan sausage sandwiches sandwiches with vegan deli slices tofurkey is the only one that's kinda funky fruit dinner leftovers couscous salad vegan sushi potato or pasta salad dinner sloppy joes sausage and gravy with homemade biscuits spaghetti and trader joe's meatballs or tvp lasagna thai pad see ew pad khi mao drunkard's noodles pad prig king tofu eggplant with basil sauce yellow thai curry with tofu or vegan chikn and veggies and jasmine rice indian dal with homemade roti or dosai channa masala aloo gobi vegetable or minestrone soup pizza steamed pork buns with potstickers or spring rolls sweet sour orange lemon chikn vegan pho or wonton soup i use these sites to find recipes http www foodnetwork com http vegweb com http www recipezaar com there have been vegan olympic gold medalists and a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential http en wikipedia org wiki carl lewis http www eatright org cps rde xchg ada hs xsl

just woundering dose any one know if a tomato is a fruit or a vegtable i was just woundering and what it is consitered when you eat it a fruit serving or a vegtable serving technically due to the ovaries it is a fruit but for all intents and purposes we tend to consider it a vegetable true fruits are developed from the ovary in the base of the flower and contain the seeds of the plant though cultivated forms may be seedless blueberries raspberries and oranges are true fruits and so are many kinds of nut some plants have a soft part which supports the seeds and is also called a 'fruit' though it is not developed from the ovary the strawberry is an example as far as cooking is concerned some things which are strictly fruits may be called 'vegetables' because they are used in savoury rather than sweet cooking the tomato though technically a fruit is often used as a vegetable and a bean pod is also technically a fruit the term 'vegetable' is more generally used of other edible parts of plants such as cabbage leaves celery stalks and potato tubers which are not strictly the fruit of the plant from which they come occasionally the term 'fruit' may be used to refer to a part of a plant which is not a fruit but which is used in sweet cooking rhubarb for example so a tomato is the fruit of the tomato plant but can be used as a vegetable in cooking  Tomato Flowering plant Berry Potato Pie Sweet potato Banana Cuisine of the Southern United States German cuisine Antioxidant Watermelon Pachypodium brevicaule Strawberry Roman eating and drinking Hamster Maize Pancake Soup Peruvian cuisine Pea Sweetcorn Orange (fruit) Bengali cuisine Sauce Carpel Curry Ginkgo Salad Russian cuisine Celery Japanese cuisine Cajun cuisine Common bean Pachypodium baronii Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of the Philippines Bean Jam Cuisine of Singapore Squash (fruit) Jewish cuisine Food preservation Polish cuisine Pollination Food Organic food Legume Pachypodium bicolor Luther Burbank Cuisine of Brazil Almond Basil Veganism Agriculture Prunus Pumpkin Plant Chicken soup Cereal Blueberry Textile manufacturing Perfume Vegetative reproduction Rose Korean cuisine Drupe Chocolate Chili con carne Hot dog Carnivorous plant Cucumber Cuisine of Africa Essential oil Garden Strawberry Morphology of Pachypodium Yam Soul food Chinese cuisine Beet Kiwifruit Olive Coconut Coriander Loganberry Vicia faba Seed

im thinking about going vegan its good for the animals and good for me too i read about it and checked out the vegan food pyramid too to help me know what to eat and what not to eat i think its a great idea and i know i would try my hardest to stay with it but the only problem is my family how can i tell them this is what i want without them looking at me like i'm crazy and i take my own lunch to school what could i make and every other meal what do i make get there is a japanese analogy proverb that goes like this the nail that sticks up is the one that gets hammered down people are like this everywhere when you tell your family that it is your personal belief that animals should not be eaten they take a look at themselves and it can be subconsciously translated into what you do is wrong and i choose to be right your parents have probably been taught a huge amount of misinformation by their parents and their teachers while growing up you really need to research vegetarian diets and health before you even think about saying the v word in front of your parents when you have gathered enough information and feel confident in a vegetarian diet's ability to maintain or even improve health you may mention to them that you have made the decision they may be shocked angry worried curious or many other things but you must never react to their behavior and always stay calm if they are able to speak to you and respect your choice please tell them everything and answer all questions if they are rude inconsiderate judgmental violent or verbally abusive refuse to continue any conversation until they can speak to you with respect the best advice is to study everything that you can about a healthy vegetarian diet and keep yourself in good shape better than most people your age or than your friends family if possible if nobody that you know shows a genuine positive interest in your choice don't give them the privilege of the knowledge that you have gathered work your way around any attempts they make to trivialize your beliefs and if possible go shopping with your parents and buy things that aren't obvious veggie fare instead of trying to sneak fake meat into the cart toss in lentil soup peanut butter pasta fruits veggies or anything else that you have learned is needed to fill any gaps in your diet my biggest word of advice is to learn how to cook prepare everything that you will need to keep yourself satisfied before you start to label yourself as vegan this is important in keeping yourself healthy and working towards a fit body that can redefine vegan stereotypes your journey as vegetarian was just the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this should be due to the reality of factory farming in which animals that are kept alive to produce milk eggs etc suffer much more and longer than animals that are raised to a certain weight and then slaughtered http www veganoutreach org whyvegan http meat org some people use the word vegan in reference to this idea but be aware that applying that label to yourself should always come with the inclusion of wise activism and advocacy http www veganoutreach org advocacy index html two extremely important examples of this are that you should never speak to someone about vegetarianism veganism without their consent and genuine interest or as a comment on what they are eating and your dietary beliefs should never be used as an introduction or explanation of who you are as a person veg ism should be something that comes up after people get to know you and they offer you a situation that makes it confusing to withhold the information discussion also if you are presented something that you choose not to eat or you are ordering food eating together somewhere picking the best place to eat a responsible vegan always studies the subject of their own health and how to keep their body completely provided for in every sense http www veganhealth org sh to neglect their body is to define a plant based diet as unhealthy and is the opposite of helping the animals when you you hold off on the subject until it's necessary and then act like it isn't a big deal at all people are usually surprised and way more interested and curious than if you were to bring it up when someone's eating or just using it as a conversation starter a balanced plant based diet includes grains breads pasta rice cereal legumes soy beans peas lentils fruit and vegetables http www pcrm org health veginfo vsk food groups html http www peta org accidentallyvegan http www veganoutreach org whyvegan eating html being vegan can be an art one whose challenge is to take things that involve the suffering of the innocent and change them into something free of cruelty a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential technically the term vegetarian does imply that you don't consume anything that comes from the body of an animal that requires killing it many ingredients such as gelatin and glycerin are found in many candies fig newtons and many of other foods as well as rennet found in many cheeses http www happycow net health animal ingredients html the best thing to remember is to take your time so that for example when you are comfortable not eating whey and casein you can then give up sodium stearoyl lactylate and l cysteine when you are sure you can make the commitment permanently depending on your age or reliance on parents or regional options it may not be best to give yourself a label the important thing is to do your best to make progress and be committed to your compassion towards animals never put your focus onto what you or other people use to describe yourself if you meet someone that talks down to people for eating meat dairy etc or to you because they think they are more veg than you laugh in their face and tell them they are a disgrace to the entire philosophy people like this only hurt the idea of veg ism and the animals the point of all of this is to live compassionately and and as free from cruelty as you can all the while maintaining your health and a positive attitude people who don't maintain either need not open their mouths and represent our beliefs if you actually choose to read all of this i hope it helps if not feel free to e mail me if you have questions i'm vegan and these are some of my favorite things to eat breakfast bananas cream of wheat with brown sugar and soy butter cereal pancakes or french toast with real maple syrup vegan sausage patties smoothies lunch vegan sausage sandwiches sandwiches with vegan deli slices tofurkey is the only one that's kinda funky fruit dinner leftovers couscous salad vegan sushi potato or pasta salad dinner sloppy joes sausage and gravy with homemade biscuits spaghetti and trader joe's meatballs or tvp lasagna thai pad see ew pad khi mao drunkard's noodles pad prig king tofu eggplant with basil sauce yellow thai curry with tofu or vegan chikn and veggies and jasmine rice indian dal with homemade roti or dosai channa masala aloo gobi vegetable or minestrone soup pizza steamed pork buns with potstickers or spring rolls sweet sour

becoming a vegan i'm thinking about becoming a vegetarian but not sure what all i would have to give up i know meat products but other than that i am clueless also what do i have to do in order to stay healthy keep all the regular vitamins that meat products supply me with protein etc thank you all so far i will probably stick with dairy products as i rarely eat a lot of them anyway as i'm already pretty much lactose intolerant i had gastric bypass in if any of you could provide websites that i could look at that would be helpful thank you as far as what you need to give up that depends on whether you want to become a vegan or a vegetarian becoming a vegan is the stricter of the two vegans do not eat anything that comes from animals that means no meat cheese eggs milk etc etc vegetarians however can vary immensely most diets are based on your person beliefs or goals as a vegetarian you can eat all diary products poultry and fish whether you want to cut out any of these from your diet is your own choice for example i do not eat chicken but i will eat fish and all diary products in order to stay healthy you should try to keep your diet as diverse as possible eating what you would normally eat as a meat eater just without the meat is the one mistake many new vegetarians make a book or web reference of vegetarian recipes is probably your best bet if you don't already have foods in mind another thing to keep in mind is that if you like the meat recipes you can always substitute the meat for vegi meat if you get the right brands it tastes just as good as the actual meat one of my family members is a die hard meat eater but when we served him a sloppy joe with ground meatless on it he didn't even notice is wasn't meat until we told him afterwards vitamins are a good thing to take as well i personally take vitamin c and d pills i get sufficient amounts of protein from other foods such as beans eggs and seafood i've been a vegetarian for a good majority of my life and i can tell you this much it ends up being a lot healthier than a meat diet if you pay attention to what you do  Meat analogue Egg (food) Food Cheese Cuisine of Brazil Kashrut Hamburger Vegetarian nutrition Milk Soy milk Vegetarianism and religion Dieting Kosher foods Chili con carne Chicken Pizza Healthy eating Chocolate Lactose intolerance Soybean Pesco/pollo vegetarianism McDonald's Raw food diet Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Ramen Animal rights Nutrition Atkins Nutritional Approach Buddhist cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Environmental vegetarianism French cuisine Meat Peruvian cuisine Protein Omega-3 fatty acid Coronary heart disease Japanese cuisine Stomach cancer Hot dog Taboo food and drink Guinea pig Livestock Vitamin Korean cuisine Russian cuisine Dairy Jewish cuisine French fries Breakfast Cat Vitamin D Soul food Irish cuisine MRE Marmite Organic food Bengali cuisine Sausage Tlingit Barbecue Cuisine of Singapore Quorn Punk ideology Cajun cuisine Domestic rabbit Hedgehog Tooth Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of Africa Breastfeeding Lisa the Vegetarian Gelatin Halaal German cuisine Curry Crohn's disease Soup Domesticated turkey Taiwanese cuisine Salmon Cuisine of the Southern United States Fecal incontinence Fruitarianism Adjustable gastric band Vitamin C Fugu

push me over the line please i'm a vegetarian and i am really trying hard to be a vegan but i can't do it because i'm always hungry and i don't have time to make special meals every day to ensure i'm getting adequate amounts of protein and a few essential vitamins and minerals it's also hard socially because i'm going out a lot and there's never anything vegan friendly i'm someone who can't go hungry without getting irritable and i hate the feeling i'm not a nice person to be around once i eat something vegetarian i just tell myself well i've already screwed up i may as well make the most of it and start again tomorrow in other words i'm a lazy vegan wannabe i guess what i'm asking for you to do is just reinforce the reasons why i should become a vegan i'm being stupid and lazy and need a kick in the head to wake up i don't eat meat never it's just small things like dairy and products containing eggs those sorts of things i'm not taking it seriously and i wish that i could cupcake it's not about me it's about saving the animals and the environment i care about that but i don't have enough self discipline to stop myself from making the wrong food choices i'm asking for encourgement if you don't have the answer then rack off i don't want to hear about your eating habits if thats not my question second that to all three of you there's no point answering a question with jibberish when it's not relevant i'm not asking whether i should eat meat or not go enjoy your steak and leave others be once i eat something vegetarian i just tell myself 'well i've already screwed up i may as well make the most of it and start again tomorrow' that is an absolutely terrible way to think even if you eat something with dairy or egg in it you should not let that sabotage the rest of your meals for the day i'm sure you can do it i don't have a lot of time for special meals either i make them as i go they really don't take long to cook i'm not sure if you are asking a question about good protein sources or not but nuts nut butters leafy greens tofu soy milk soy products and protein bars all provide protein and none of which take a long time to prepare if you eat a well balanced varied diet you are almost guaranteed to get all of the vitamins and minerals you could even back that up with a multi vitamin as for getting irritable when being hungry that isn't good think about all of the starving children in africa you have little reason to get irritable start carrying around snacks for when you get hungry i e fresh veggies fruit nuts it would help to get rid of all of the dairy and egg in your house that way you can't eat any of it and ruin your day you need to take this seriously all lives should be taken seriously  Dieting Food Vegetarian cuisine Vegetarian nutrition Cheese Kashrut Healthy eating Guinea pig Korean cuisine Soy milk Meat analogue Dairy Omega-3 fatty acid Fecal incontinence Hamster Food guide pyramid Cuisine of the Philippines Milk Hamburger Cuisine of Denmark Cuisine of Brazil Japanese cuisine Kosher foods Bengali cuisine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sausage Organic food Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Buddhist cuisine Crohn's disease Meal Chinese cuisine Chicken French cuisine Peter Singer Ice cream Nutrition Pizza Garfield Vegetarianism and religion Vitamin C Soy protein Ramen Protein Tlingit Stomach cancer Baldrick Bodybuilding Domestic rabbit Coronary heart disease Cat Cantonese cuisine Chili con carne Coffee 613 mitzvot Little Britain Anorexia nervosa Peruvian cuisine Lisa the Vegetarian German cuisine Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Folic acid Peanut Japanese tea ceremony Snack food Cake Cuisine of Singapore Fruitarianism Peanut butter Cyanocobalamin Cuisine of Africa Rickets Livestock Hypoglycemia Taiwanese cuisine Atkins Nutritional Approach Acorn Fancy rat Factory farming Natt__ Comanche Jewish cuisine Breastfeeding

i want to become a vegetarian but i am a teen and need my parents help i mean i need help on buying the food and learning how to cook it i am a fairly good cook but i will still need tons of their help how can i go about doing this i mean how should i persuade them to help me also if you are a vegetarian how should i find good easy recipes i do not know how to cook all vegetable meals very well any suggestions i also feel pretty much weighed down by everything i know nothing about all of this and i have done researched but i still feel like i do not know how to completely do it well for starters i would say that fresh salads should accompany every dinner meal you could put yourself in charge of this there are tons of salad recipes but most important use your imagination cut up some bell peppers carrots cucumber add in some croutons slices of cheese etc throw in some tomatoes or spice things up with some jalepeno peppers there are also some great rice salads out there with veggies this could be an important first step into working your vegetarian lifestyle in with your parents they cannot deny the tastiness and healthiness of the salads you should seek out a school nurse family doctor or dietician who could give you a menu of foods that will help ensure you get all of your nutrients this way you'll be directly speaking with an expert with all of the answers they can explain how healthy this is for you to your parents and your parents will likely accept a professional's opinion they will be able to give you a list of good easy recipes that can get you started as well the reason i recommended the salad is because it's simply an excellent beginning eventually you can get zuchini and squash and grill them or steam them in the microwave ask for a veggie steamer for your birthday or suggest it to your parents i am sure that your parents will love the idea of steaming veggies in a more easy way this will give you steamed corn broccoli squash etc to perfection there are tons of tasty things you can do with potatoes as well pick out some spices that sound good lemon and pepper lemon and herb garlic and herb are some suggestions cut the potatoes into strips or have your parents to it and mix up a teaspoon of cider vinegar with a tablespoon of canola oil then sprinkle the potatoes with it let them soak for a few minutes then sprinkle some herbs and some fresh parsley on them and grill them i use the george foreman grill and i highly suggest that if you dont have this to suggest it to your other family as a gift for your parents at christmas time here's a recipe for excellent corn on the cob soak the cobs still in the husks in some warm water with a dash of salt for one hour after the hour unhusk the corn get a cutting board cut up some fresh parsley scoop out a lot of butter tablespoons or so mix a small handful of parlsey into the butter mass add garlic salt it's a spice to taste it usually takes a lot of garlic salt take a test taste of the mass it should not taste too buttery but have a slight garlic salty taste to it add more parsley or garlic to taste rub the butter mixture onto each cob lavishly then wrap up each individual corn on the cob in foil preheat the oven to degrees place these wrapped cobs into a baking dish of some kind and then place them into the oven bake for minutes after minutes the corn is ready to be served keep them wrapped for people and it will keep the savory taste of parsley and the garlic salt in the corn this is excellent and will be a huge hit anyway good luck to you  Bagel Ketchup Sandwich Russian cuisine Soul food Cheese Cuisine of Malaysia Roman eating and drinking Gumbo Ramen Cuisine of the Southern United States Dumpling Cuisine of Turkey Cuisine of Laos Cuisine of Singapore Kebab In-N-Out Burger Rice pudding Potato Veganism Bacon Garlic McDonald's Vinegar Cuisine of Africa Pancake Food Dim sum Tamale Cuisine of Cambodia Kelantan Cuisine of Vietnam Coffee British cuisine Chowder Rice Cha chaan teng Cuisine of Thailand Nabemono Risotto Maize Yoghurt Organic food Sushi Polish cuisine Oregano Pickling Black pepper Tomato Kraft Dinner Roast beef Asado Pasta Cuisine of Argentina Kosher foods American Chinese cuisine Potato salad Ice cream Hamster Soy milk Food preservation Omega-3 fatty acid

why is protein always equated with meat is something wrong with the american school system or what it ought to be common knowledge that protein is ubiquitous in all living things right down to bacteria and viruses we got really mad at japan for not wanting to import our beef its also the same reason the milk industry gets mad when soy comes into the picture and the same reason the riaa gets mad when web radio cuts in on their profits your obvious answer for why protein is always acquainted with meat is probably the reason calcium is always acquainted with milk and its also the reason i love fabreeze so much but don't have a clue as to what is inside it good marketing  Tofu Livestock Vegetarianism Soy milk Veganism Cheese Protein Meat analogue Food Dairy Insulin Organic food Francis Crick Growth hormone treatment Horse meat Agriculture in Australia Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Beef Quorn Soy protein Vegetarian nutrition Cell (biology) Antiviral drug Antibody Infant formula Virus Iron In-N-Out Burger Taiwanese cuisine Taboo food and drink Factory farming Ice cream Economics Calcium in biology Crohn's disease Japanese cuisine Food preservation Life Chicken Guinea pig Biology Surimi Cuisine of Malaysia Origin of life Prion Tlingit Peruvian cuisine Hamburger Bacteria Ramen Whaling Genetically modified organism Buddhist cuisine Singlish Foot-and-mouth disease Foodborne illness Major histocompatibility complex Bertrand Russell Yoghurt Breakfast Cuisine of the Southern United States Escherichia coli O157:H7 Gene McDonald's Ann Veneman Lactose intolerance The Emancipation of Mimi Pasteurization Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Molecular biology Cattle Sugar Human skin color Free trade Immune system Food allergy Bioinformatics Breastfeeding Chinglish James D.

why are dried beans healthier than canned beans besides being lower in sodium for the same reason that eating an actual apple is healthier than frozen applesauce anything that is processed is not as healthy as something that you cook yourself when food goes through the processing machinery it loses vitamins and minerals the longer it sits there closer to nature healthier of course i am not saying that canned beans are unhealthy they are healthier than most other processed food and the slight health difference may not be worth the difference in convenience  Organic food Food preservation Milk Nutrition Vitamin C Tofu Food Veganism Hamster Common bean Sauerkraut Folic acid Potassium Ramen Breastfeeding Soy milk Coffee Tomato Fast food Healthy eating Foodborne illness Chocolate Dieting Obesity Domesticated turkey Marmite Vegetarian nutrition Soybean Vitamin D Food storage Junk food Chili con carne Food technology Vitamin Dietary fiber Pea Soul food Cuisine of Malaysia Dairy Atkins Nutritional Approach Tocopherol Tempeh Omega-3 fatty acid Hot dog Organic farming Kashrut Vegetarianism Food guide pyramid Natt__ Tlingit Sauce French cuisine Canning Tea Bean Apple Raw food diet Bodybuilding Rice Egg (food) Cholesterol Kitchen Health insurance Prostate cancer Tooth Jewish cuisine Super Size Me Fecal incontinence French fries Peanut Tai Chi Chuan Zinc Cuisine of Laos E number Homeopathy Genetically modified food Soup Domestic rabbit Margarine Sodium chloride Taro Paleolithic diet Low-carbohydrate diet Cheese Anemia Edible salt American Black Bear Cannabis cultivation Miso Anorexia nervosa Barbecue Garlic Vitasoy Binge eating disorder Mexican cuisine Diarrhea Soy protein Cuisine of the Southern United States Sprouting

if you're a non vegan vegetarian are you a hypocrite vegetarians who are pro animal rights but who continue to eat dairy eggs or fish seem like they're hypocrtires if you eat cheese eggs and fish you support the dairy egg and fish industry which is really no different than the slaughter industry chickens used to produce eggs and cows used to produce milk and fish caught or farm raised ultimately lead to their demise and the demise of the environment in order to become a true vegetarian is veganism the only way to go i agree veganism is the way to go for people who care about animal suffering egg laying hens are some of the most abused creatures on the planet i once went to a lecture on vegetarianism and the speaker said that as far as suffering is concerned it's much better to eat steak than to eat eggs eggs http goveg com factoryfarming chickens egg asp milk http goveg com factoryfarming cows dairy asp still vegetarians have a very positive impact so let's not condemn them i was vegetarian for over five years before i even became aware that egg production involves animal cruelty few people make the jump from meat eater to vegan overnight vegetarianism is a good step  People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Kashrut Egg (food) Factory farming Dairy Kosher foods Livestock Chicken Animal rights Meat analogue Cheese Taboo food and drink Tofu Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Vegetarianism and religion Dairy cattle Food Vegetarian nutrition Animal Liberation Front Agriculture Environmental vegetarianism Cuisine of Brazil Hamburger Pizza Buddhist cuisine Peter Singer French cuisine Soy milk Meat Dairy product Cattle Dieting Soybean Omega-3 fatty acid Japanese cuisine Egg (biology) Chili con carne Quorn Raw food diet Cuisine of Denmark Whaling Milk Cajun cuisine Agriculture in Australia Unclean animals Bengali cuisine Cuisine of Malaysia Slaughterhouse Animal husbandry Cuisine of Singapore Frog Halaal Jewish cuisine McDonald's Food guide pyramid Barry Horne Cuisine of the Philippines Pancake Snake Bovine somatotropin British cuisine Animal welfare Whale Hindu Marshmallow Organic farming Gelatin Sausage Chinese cuisine Cat Punk ideology Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler German cuisine Sandwich Domestic goat Porridge Animal liberation movement Korean cuisine Crohn's disease Fish and chips Cuisine of Norway Foie gras Peruvian cuisine Cruelty to animals Cha chaan teng Cheddar cheese Organic food Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Dim sum Roman eating and drinking Horse Kangaroo

vegan or vegetarian okay i would like to cut meat competely out of my diet i've been researching on the web for a couple of days now but their is one problem vegan's don't agree with the consumption of diary products i love ice cream milk and eggs what can i do i would prefer being a vegan than a vegetarian but what can i do does anybody know any great sites that i can check out i mean i know milk is good for the bones and stuff but after i do stop do i start taking supplements or something also does anybody know about how to tell my family this my family loves meat i own a lot of pets and whenever i see them eating meat i feel the need to gag so does anybody know any good books and websites that would help me out plus should i visit my doctor before switching diets there is a japanese analogy proverb that goes like this the nail that sticks up is the one that gets hammered down people are like this everywhere when you tell your family that it is your personal belief that animals should not be eaten they take a look at themselves and it can be subconsciously translated into what you do is wrong and i choose to be right your parents have probably been taught a huge amount of misinformation by their parents and their teachers while growing up you really need to research vegetarian diets and health before you even think about saying the v word in front of your parents when you have gathered enough information and feel confident in a vegetarian diet's ability to maintain or even improve health you may mention to them that you have made the decision they may be shocked angry worried curious or many other things but you must never react to their behavior and always stay calm if they are able to speak to you and respect your choice please tell them everything and answer all questions if they are rude inconsiderate judgmental violent or verbally abusive refuse to continue any conversation until they can speak to you with respect the best advice is to study everything that you can about a healthy vegetarian diet and keep yourself in good shape better than most people your age or than your friends family if possible if nobody that you know shows a genuine positive interest in your choice don't give them the privilege of the knowledge that you have gathered work your way around any attempts they make to trivialize your beliefs and if possible go shopping with your parents and buy things that aren't obvious veggie fare instead of trying to sneak fake meat into the cart toss in lentil soup peanut butter pasta fruits veggies or anything else that you have learned is needed to fill any gaps in your diet you do not have to become vegan overnight i wouldn't even recommend it if you have already given up meat you've made a huge step and becoming vegan should take a while in order to adjust your body and mind to gradual changes that you make don't get your doctor involved unless you already know that they are vegetarian or vegan doctors can be very biased against veg diets because they think that they know everything even though the average doctor only has a few hours of nutrition training just educate yourself before you make major changes or restrictions to your diet if you want to become a lacto ovo vegetarian the transition should be quite simple almost all meats have widely available commercial replacements all that you have to do is replace any flesh in your diet beef pork poultry seafood with meat analogs or just leave it out altogether you should keep in mind that a journey such as this can be quite short but should just be the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this is because of the reality of factory farming in which animals that are kept alive to produce milk eggs etc suffer much more and longer than animals that are raised to a certain weight and then slaughtered http www veganoutreach org whyvegan http meat org some people use the word vegan in reference to this idea but be aware that applying that label to yourself should always come with the inclusion of wise activism and advocacy http www veganoutreach org advocacy index html two extremely important examples of this are that you should never speak to someone about vegetarianism veganism without their consent and genuine interest or as a comment on what they are eating and your dietary beliefs should never be used as an introduction or explanation of who you are as a person veg ism should be something that comes up after people get to know you and they offer you a situation that makes it confusing to withhold the information discussion also if you are presented something that you choose not to eat or you are ordering food eating together somewhere picking the best place to eat when you you hold off on the subject until it's necessary and then act like it isn't a big deal at all people are usually surprised and way more interested and curious than if you were to bring it up when someone's eating or just using it as a conversation starter a responsible vegan always studies the subject of their own health and how to keep their body completely provided for in every sense http www veganhealth org sh to neglect their body is to define a plant based diet as unhealthy and is the opposite of helping the animals just to clear things up the vegetarian vegan diet is not composed of salads vegetables fruit and fake meat fruits and vegetables are always important but they do not make up the largest portion of any healthy diet a balanced plant based diet includes grains breads pasta rice cereal legumes soy beans peas lentils fruit and vegetables http www pcrm org health veginfo vsk food groups html http www peta org accidentallyvegan http www veganoutreach org whyvegan eating html being vegan can be an art one whose challenge is to take things that involve the suffering of the innocent and change them into something free of cruelty there have been vegan olympic gold medalists and a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential http en wikipedia org wiki carl lewis http www eatright org cps rde xchg ada hs xsl advocacy enu html draft htm technically the term vegetarian does imply that you don't consume anything that comes from the body of an animal that requires killing it many ingredients such as gelatin and glycerin are found in many candies fig newtons and many of other foods as well as rennet found in many cheeses http www happycow net health animal ingredients html the best thing to remember is to take your time so that for example when you are comfortable not eating beef and pork you can then give up chicken when you are sure you can make the commitment permanently depending on your age or reliance on parents or regional options it may not be best to give yourself a label the important thing is to do your best to make progress and be committed to your compassion towards animals never put your focus onto what you or other people use to describe yourself if you meet someone that talks down to people for eating meat dairy etc or to you because they think they are more veg than you laugh in their face and tell them they are a disgrace to the entire philosophy people like this only hurt the idea of veg ism and the animals the point of all of this is to live compassionately and and as free from cruelty as you can all the while maintaining your health and a positive attitude people who don't maintain either need not open their mouths and represent our beliefs if you actually choose to read all of this i hope it helps if not feel free to e mail me if you have questions i'm vegan and these are some of my favorite things to eat breakfast bananas cream of wheat with brown sugar and soy butter cereal pancakes or french toast with real maple syrup vegan sausage patties smoothies lunch vegan sausage sandwiches sandwiches with vegan deli slices tofurkey is the only one that's kinda funky fruit dinner leftovers couscous salad vegan sushi potato or pasta salad dinner sloppy joes sausage and gravy with homemade biscuits spaghetti and trader joe's meatballs or tvp lasagna thai pad

what is the difference between plant protein and meat protein if any i've been gradually reducing my meat intake in pursuit of becoming a vegetarian i have zero support from family members in this matter and i am constantly being told by them that the protein i get from tofu or other vegetable product is not the same as a meat protein and that the body needs the protein derived from meat to be balanced is any of this true are vegetables and vegetable products not enough to get the type of protein a body needs do i have to take some certain supplements to make up for the type of protein i'm not getting from meat one difference is the body uses the amino acids that make up protein the body has to break down meat protein into amino acids to use them plants protein is already mostly broken down and more accessable quote from ole plants will never have all essential ammino acids so you need to make sure that you compliment tofu with other types of plant protein gram for gram you will also have to eat more of the plants to get the same amount of protein source s college health class where to start people need not amino acids tofu isn't god's gift to vegans i haven't eaten it in years no one eats just food so with our disire for variety we don't need to worry about balance raw protein is twice as absorbable as cooked since animal protein is usually cooked you need to eat less plant protein to equal meat i'm sorry that oli took health class in the ' 's during the protein obsession a little knowledge was dangerous scientists later discovered the amino acid pool and protein recycling which explains how cows chickens gorillas elephants horses and humans etc can be vegans and be strong and healthy  Soybean Tofu Nutrition Vegetarian nutrition Dieting Protein Cheese Gelatin Egg (food) Vitamin C Food Omega-3 fatty acid Raw food diet Biochemistry Sausage Healthy eating Aspartame Livestock Atkins Nutritional Approach Ecology Guinea pig Iron Amino acid Hamburger Soy protein Taboo food and drink Human skin color Folic acid Sugar substitute Hypoglycemia Cyanocobalamin Coronary heart disease Vegetarian cuisine Vitamin Meat analogue Zinc Japanese cuisine Kashrut Trans fat Soy milk Dietary fiber Kosher foods Brain Aztec Protein sequencing Nutrient Natt__ Essential amino acid Dog Cat Cassava Tocopherol Foodborne illness Chocolate Peanut butter Food guide pyramid Factory farming Blood Tooth enamel Burger Environmental vegetarianism Tooth Cat food Vitasoy Cuisine of Malaysia Dairy Hormone Origin of life Biotin Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Enzyme Diabetic ketoacidosis Monosodium glutamate Russian cuisine Rice Bovine somatotropin Organic farming Anemia Francis Crick Korean cuisine Meat Animal rights Gene Vermicompost Prostate cancer Protein-energy malnutrition Fasting

as a recent vegetarian and avid weightlifter how do i maintain my weight what should i eat i was recently discharged from the us marines and came out physically strong as i've ever been but now since i stopped eating meat for ethical reasons i'm loosing weight fast which i don't want i'm ' and used to weigh all muscle but now i'm down to what am i supposed to eat in order to somewhat maintain my peak weight have you heard of mike mahler http www bodybuilding com fun mahler htm he is a vegan strength coach and kettle bell instructor he as been hired by likes of ken shamrock and many others i don't know what your diet is like but the recommended protein intake for increasing muscle mass while strength training is to grams of ptotein per pound of lean body weight per day tvp made from soy protein concentrate and vital wheat gluten are two excellent sources of protein both allow you to have complete control over the amount of fat that you add to the final product tvp can be protein and vital wheat gluten is don't listen to any of the jokers that tell you meat is essential i weighed less than when i went veg at and now i'm ' lbs and gaining i'm vegan now and when i weighed something i wasn't fat free so i'm estimating at least lbs of muscle gained after becoming vegan i'm vegan and these are some of my favorite things to eat breakfast bananas cream of wheat with brown sugar and soy butter cereal pancakes or french toast with real maple syrup vegan sausage patties smoothies lunch vegan sausage sandwiches sandwiches with vegan deli slices tofurkey is the only one that's kinda funky fruit dinner leftovers couscous salad vegan sushi potato or pasta salad dinner sloppy joes sausage and gravy with homemade biscuits spaghetti and trader joe's meatballs or tvp lasagna thai pad see ew pad khi mao drunkard's noodles pad prig king tofu eggplant with basil sauce yellow thai curry with tofu or vegan chikn and veggies and jasmine rice indian dal with homemade roti or dosai channa masala aloo gobi vegetable or minestrone soup pizza steamed pork buns with potstickers or spring rolls sweet sour orange lemon chikn vegan pho or wonton soup i use these sites to find recipes http www foodnetwork com http vegweb com http www recipezaar com there have been vegan olympic gold medalists and a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential http en wikipedia org wiki carl lewis http www eatright org cps rde xchg ada hs xsl advocacy enu html draft htm if you want to become a lacto ovo vegetarian the transition should be quite simple almost all meats have widely available commercial replacements all that you have to do is replace any flesh in your diet beef pork poultry seafood with meat analogs or just leave it out altogether you should keep in mind that a journey such as this can be quite short but should just be the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this is because of the reality of factory farming in which animals that are kept alive to produce milk eggs etc suffer much more and longer than animals that are raised to a certain weight and then slaughtered http www veganoutreach org whyvegan http meat org some people use the word vegan in reference to this idea but be aware that applying that label to yourself should always come with the inclusion of wise activism and advocacy http www veganoutreach org advocacy index html two extremely important examples of this are that you should never speak to someone about vegetarianism veganism without their consent and genuine interest or as a comment on what they are eating and your dietary beliefs should never be used as an introduction or explanation of who you are as a person veg ism should be something that comes up after people get to know you and they offer you a situation that makes it confusing to withhold the information discussion also if you are presented something that you choose not to eat or you are ordering food eating together somewhere picking the best place to eat when you you hold off on the subject until it's necessary and then act like it isn't a big deal at all people are usually surprised and way more interested and curious than if you were to bring it up when someone's eating or just using it as a conversation starter a responsible vegan always studies the subject of their own health and how to keep their body completely provided for in every sense http www veganhealth org sh to neglect their body is to define a plant based diet as unhealthy and is the opposite of helping the animals just to clear things up the vegetarian vegan diet is not composed of salads vegetables fruit and fake meat fruits and vegetables are always important but they do not make up the largest portion of any healthy diet a balanced plant based diet includes grains breads pasta rice cereal legumes soy beans peas lentils fruit and vegetables http www pcrm org health veginfo vsk food groups html http www peta org accidentallyvegan http www veganoutreach org whyvegan eating html being vegan can be an art one whose challenge is to take things that involve the suffering of the innocent and change them into something free of cruelty technically the term vegetarian does imply that you don't consume anything that comes from the body of an animal that requires killing it many ingredients such as gelatin and glycerin are found in many candies fig newtons and many of other foods as well as rennet found in many cheeses http www happycow net health animal ingredients html the best thing to remember is to take your time so that for example when you are comfortable not eating beef and pork you can then give up chicken when you are sure you can make the commitment permanently depending on your age or reliance on parents or regional options it may not be best to give yourself a label the important thing is to do your best to make progress and be committed to your compassion towards animals never put your focus onto what you or other people use to describe yourself if you meet someone that talks down to people for eating meat dairy etc or to you because they think they are more veg than you laugh in their face and tell them they are a disgrace to the entire philosophy people like this only hurt the idea of veg ism and the animals the point of all of this is to live compassionately and and as free from cruelty as you can all the while maintaining your health and a positive attitude people who don't maintain either need not open their mouths and represent our beliefs if you actually choose to read all of this i hope it helps if not feel free to e mail me if you have questions
