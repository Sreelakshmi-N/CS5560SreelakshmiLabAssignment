has anyone else used chantix to quite smoking i have it took away my cravings and i also noticed i wasn't over eating or drinking as much i had great luck what about you i used chantix for months but i didnt stop smoking it is a good drug and will help you stop but for most people you must be ready to quit and meet it half way you have to try to obstain from smoking starting one week after startin the chantix first try i was going though a lot of stress with my sister and her death with cancer and stopped but plan to try again and have set a date to start date to quit i think the buddy system will work the best and even though chantix cut cravings a lot i learned you still got to be willing to really stop and make an effort as it can't make you stop all by itself usually one girl at work stopped days after starting chantix and has not smoked since and she was a heavy smoker pray for me to succeed this time the only side effect i had was nausea when i would take it with a cup of coffee in the morning best to drink big glass of water and eat something before you take it  Tobacco smoking Stomach cancer Alcoholics Anonymous Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma EastEnders Cannabis (drug) Bong Cocaine Cigarette Alcoholism Friends 2000 Australian Grand Prix Cancer Norway national football team Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Oasis (band) Liam Gallagher Charmed Marathon (sport) The Smoking Room Medical cannabis USS Trigger (SS-237) Cancer of the larynx Battle of Kursk Spice Girls The Contender (television series) Hangover Breakfast Lung cancer Blood on the Tracks USS Wasp (CV-18) The Notorious B.I.G.

can you tell me anything about colon cancer thank you please tell me anything you now colon cancer is malignant tissue that grows in the wall of the colon the majority of tumors begin when normal tissue in the colon wall forms an adenomatous polyp or pre cancerous growth projecting from the colon wall as this polyp grows larger the tumor is formed this process can take many years which allows time for early detection with screening tests unfortunately the early stages of colon cancer may not have any symptoms this is why it is important to have screening tests done even though you may feel well as the polyp grows into a tumor it may bleed or obstruct the colon causing symptoms these symptoms include bleeding from the rectum blood in the stool or toilet after a bowel movement a change in the shape of the stool i e thinning cramping pain in the abdomen feeling the need to have a bowel movement when you don't actually have to as you can see these symptoms can also be caused by conditions other than cancer if you experience these symptoms you should be checked by a doctor  Prostate cancer Stomach cancer Endometrial cancer Familial adenomatous polyposis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hemorrhoid Lung cancer Ovarian cancer Mesothelioma Crohn's disease Endometriosis Fecal incontinence Diverticulosis Breast cancer Constipation Urinary incontinence Cervical cancer Coeliac disease Diarrhea Radiation therapy Brain tumor Obstetrics Ulcerative colitis Malignant melanoma Sigmoidoscopy Irritable bowel syndrome Metastasis Colonoscopy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hypoglycemia Hirschsprung's disease Gastrointestinal stromal tumor Esophageal cancer Testicular cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Fecal occult blood Folic acid Aspartame Traumatic brain injury Medicine Multiple myeloma Tumor Carcinogenesis Renal cell carcinoma Kaposi's sarcoma Leukemia Barium enema Hepatocellular carcinoma Cancer of the larynx Oncology Atherosclerosis Kidney Rheumatoid arthritis Malaria Miscarriage Syringomyelia Breast Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Puberty Krukenberg tumor Menstrual cycle Acromegaly Alcoholism Computed tomography Anemia Tobacco smoking Intersex surgery Breastfeeding Ovarian cyst Human feces Muscle Myocardial infarction Aortic dissection Bowel obstruction Tocopherol Chemotherapy Hypertension Thyroid cancer Post-traumatic stress disorder Bone marrow transplant Ileostomy Gastroesophageal reflux disease Hernia Hodgkin's lymphoma Growth hormone treatment Gonorrhoea Paget's disease of bone Spina bifida Ebola

tony snow several questions concerning his cancer did white house press secretary tony snow have all of his colon removed years ago and does he have a colostomy during an interview yesterday w brian williams he looked very sick has the cancer spread to his liver what's his prognosis my prayers are with him and his family at this time if he had his colon removed he probably has a colostomy he recently found that his cancer had metastasized after being 'no evidence' of disease for two years this is not uncommon for a cancer patient 'no evidence of disease' does not mean it is not still there it just means that no one can see it and the imaging tools we have cannot pick up microscopic cancer cells so the cancer can 're occur' but actually the cancer never left it was just too small to see no one knows what the prognosis is for each individual fighting this type of cancer even if it has spread to the liver the secondary source can be removed and prognosis good much really depends on the size of the tumors if they are small than surgery or a process called radio frequency ablation is a possible means to remove them tumors attached to the outside of the liver are easier to treat than ones located inside the liver my son has had successful surgery to remove tumors on the outside of the liver and caked onto the diaphragm hundreds about the size of quarters so i know it is possible to do i also know people who have had rfa to ablate their liver tumors which worked well too tony snow is a brave individual to continue working while under treatment for such a brutal disease i have great admiration for snow and elizabeth edwards and for anyone living with cancer and that's what it is living with cancer hopefully he will be able to stablize the disease and stop any tumor progression if he can find the right combination of medication he can control the disease and live with it much like elizabeth edwards will be doing this does not mean it is cured it means the disease is controlled in the same way that diabetes can be controlled but not cured  Lung cancer Colorectal cancer Malignant melanoma Brain tumor Breast cancer Esophageal cancer Hepatocellular carcinoma Oncology Soft tissue sarcoma Renal cell carcinoma Hodgkin's lymphoma Medicine Leukemia Pneumonia Multiple sclerosis Folic acid Radiation therapy Bone marrow transplant Testicular cancer Thyroid cancer Stem cell Osteosarcoma Chemotherapy Cirrhosis Endometrial cancer Acromegaly Diabetes mellitus Liver Crohn's disease Gastrointestinal stromal tumor Epilepsy AIDS Prolactinoma Hypoglycemia Hirschsprung's disease Carcinogenesis Psoriasis Atherosclerosis Multiple myeloma Cancer of the larynx Schistosomiasis Radiosurgery Ulcerative colitis Organ transplant Helicobacter pylori Mesothelioma Penile cancer Urinary incontinence Chronic fatigue syndrome Krukenberg tumor Gene therapy Acne Gynecomastia Fecal incontinence Familial adenomatous polyposis Alzheimer's disease Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Growth hormone Aortic dissection Lupus erythematosus Endometriosis Wilms' tumor Intersex surgery Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Inflammatory bowel disease Insulin Homeopathy Atrial fibrillation Diarrhea Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Cervical cancer Medical analysis of circumcision Chlorpromazine Vitamin D Abortion Hypertension Tuberculosis Prognosis IgA nephropathy Interferon Growth hormone treatment Malaria Traumatic brain injury Cholesterol Osteoarthritis Duesberg hypothesis Hepatitis C Pancreatic cancer Virus Vitamin C

if somebody came up with a cure for cancer couldnt they put a patent on the cure and sell it for billions of dollars to big companys like blue cross blue sheid that would not be illegal would it i do not belive they would be breaking any laws would they how many millions of dollars has been invested into finding a cure for cancer and still no cure i find that hard to belive i smell a conspiracy yes they could patent it and sell it for billions however the patent would only be valid with the us other subscribing countries so it is likely offshore clinics would be started the medical brass is there to make money it will be costly everywhere because its an inelastic market use or die keep in mind that cancer is just an umbrella term for any overly divisive cell we are not talking about one disease we are talking about thousands if not more billions have probably been invested i'm betting you've never been involved in research there is a reason why we don't live forever and have flying cars the stuff takes time for example doing a protein assay to find mutated surface protiens using electrophoresis in my old lab took anywhere between and hours we could determine the concentration of like two or three protiens before we had to run a new gel now consider that applied to dna which took like a decade or two to just map let alone comprehend and all the protien derivatives there are faster methods but most labs can't afford them we just aren't smart enough research is freaking tough slow and expensive there is no conspiracy if there were a cure for all cancers it would be on the market it might be selling at a million bucks a pop but it would be there nonetheless basically get off your anti corporate high horses and face the facts don't be ungrateful the people researching are breaking their backs why don't you go work in a cancer research lab there is no conspiracy nature had billion years to obfuscate the problems we have had less than fifty years to get the untangled  Cancer Polymerase chain reaction Prostate cancer Microeconomics Illegal drug trade Insurance Pharmaceutical company W.

what is a biopsy my mom told me she had to get one on her breast does a biopsy remove cancer cells a biopsy is a test if your mom is having a breast biopsy it's probably because she found a lump the doctor will numb your mom's breast then use a long thin needle to pierce the skin and go into the lump a small piece of tissue will be sucked up in the needle and sent to a special lab technicians there will put the tissue in a special preparation on a slide then look at it through a microscope the shape and size of the cells will be able to tell them if the lump is just a lump benign or if the lump is cancer malignant if the biopsy is negative or benign that's good news and it's pretty much all over if the biospy is malignant that's bad news and your mom will meet with her doctor to decide the next step if the biopsy is undetermined that means that there wasn't a big enough sample or the sample wasn't clear enough that means a new test of some sort best wishes for you and your mom  Cancer Breast cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Needle aspiration biopsy Malignant melanoma Metastasis Soft tissue sarcoma Colorectal cancer Cancer of the larynx Anatomical pathology Thyroid cancer Brain tumor Cervical cancer Oncology Rhabdomyosarcoma Mammography Androgen insensitivity syndrome Mesothelioma Endometrial cancer Breast Medicine Multiple myeloma Renal cell carcinoma Ovarian cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Histology Cirrhosis Hyperplasia Cystoscopy Coeliac disease Hodgkin's lymphoma Oral cancer Carcinogenesis Electron microscope Hematological malignancy Peptic ulcer Medical analysis of circumcision Testicular cancer Radiation therapy Wilms' tumor Puberty Leukemia Gastrointestinal stromal tumor Psoriasis Eczema Basal cell carcinoma Hepatitis Esophageal cancer Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Staining (biology) OPV AIDS hypothesis Gram staining Asbestos Stem cell Suture Thymoma Acupuncture Rabies Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Apoptosis Microscope slide Skin cancer Cytogenetics Dermatology Uterine fibroids Yoko Ono In vitro fertilisation Histopathology Epithelium Familial adenomatous polyposis Colposcopy Insulin Cryptorchidism Ewing's sarcoma Cytomegalovirus Gastroesophageal reflux disease Adenoma Anemia Schistosomiasis Kaposi's sarcoma Knife Obstetrics Krukenberg tumor Malignant hyperthermia Malaria Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Stroke Colonoscopy Microscope Earring Ben Johnson (athlete) Breast implant Osteosarcoma Cell (biology) Shroud of Turin

what's the deal with microwaves and getting cancer i've heard that you shouldn't be in the room while they're working open the door without pressing stop look at them when they're working are any of the above true i know not to microwave with plastic plates bowls and stuff like that can any of you support your answer with a real source not just tell me that my grandma told me that exposure to microwave radiation for extended periods may well cause certain cancers to occur they may also cause cataracts birth defects and other serious health problems including nervous system damage headaches and pacemaker interference however new ovens are typically designed so as not to exceed mw cm of radiated power in addition any leak that exceeds mw cm at a distance of inches from a microwave oven is considered to be dangerous and the oven should not be used ovens can deteriorate over time and should be checked to ensure that these limits are not exceeded this can be done by your local service centre or you can purchase and earth leakage detector and have it on hand to keep a regular maintenance check of your oven if an oven is in good condition then it would present no more risk then anything else around your home such as eating processed food using mobile phones living near hv power lines or living in your house which exposes you to electromagnetic radiation from the electrical wiring with respect to the safety of using plastics in a microwave well this all depends on the type of plastic some plastics are more prone to the effect of migration whereby some additives used in plastics are more likely to migrate to foods more than others the main concern in the past has been in connection with plasticisers which are used to improve the flexibility of some packaging materials as the tendency for plasticisers to migrate increases at higher temperatures only those plastics specifically designed for oven use are suitable for cooking to reduce any possible risk one should use only microwave safe utensils while some packaging films may be labelled 'microwave safe' care should be taken to avoid direct contact with the food when using them to cover containers or to reheat dinners on plates as migration is more likely to occur into hot fatty foods glass containers are a suitable choice for heating these products as yet there are no standards for claims such as microwave safe if you are in doubt as to the safety of such materials contact the manufacturer or use a ceramic glass alternative following are some links that may be of interest  Transistor Mobile phone radiation and health Nuclear power Vacuum tube Diode Plastic Ultraviolet Solar cell Solar power Kitchen Cookware and bakeware Gas metal arc welding Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Cancer Explosive material Aluminium Transformer Glass Chernobyl accident Corrosion Electromagnetic spectrum Sewage treatment Spark plug Uranium Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Integrated circuit Fire fighting Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Incandescent light bulb Radio Solar power satellite Asbestos Gramophone record Optical fiber Soldering Electromagnetic radiation Amateur radio Floppy disk Battery (electricity) Ceramics Casting Prostate cancer Wi-Fi Tank Nuclear reactor Polyvinyl chloride Space elevator Loudspeaker Heat Food Microwave Hamster Light-emitting diode Burglar alarm Tire Stomach cancer Folic acid Universal Serial Bus Laser Coaxial cable Energy development Psoriasis Radiation hardening Thimerosal Menstrual cup Slow cooker Thermal power station Electric motor Powder metallurgy Nuclear fallout Stove Milk E85 Plutonium Glossary of firefighting terms Portland cement Printed circuit board Omega-3 fatty acid Residual-current device Furnace Motor oil Oscilloscope Organic food Directed-energy weapon Wind turbine M16 (rifle) Superconductivity

testicular cancer is testicular cancer having a lump on one of your balls or having a lump in the sack near the balls testicular cancer usually shows no early symptoms it is suspected when a mass or lump is felt in the testes although a testicular mass does not always indicate cancer and is usually painless symptoms a lump in either testicle usually pea sized but may be as large as a marble or an egg any enlargement or significant shrinking of a testicle a sensation of heaviness in the scrotum a dull ache in the groin or lower abdomen any sudden collection of fluid in the scrotum tenderness or enlargement of the breasts pain or discomfort in a testicle or in the scrotum although testicular cancer is rare it is the most common solid tumor in young men it is also one of the most highly curable cancers especially when detected early testicular self examination has not been extensively studied but most physicians recommend that men eighteen to thirty five years old perform it monthly testicular self examination is best performed after a warm shower when the scrotal skin is looser the fingertips are used to slowly palpate the entire surface of each testicle for lumps a tumor is usually painless when squeezed and feels like a rock emanating from within the testicle this should not be confused with the epididymis which is a comma shaped structure that runs alongside each testicle and contains tubes that carry sperm most scrotal abnormalities detected by healthy men do not turn out to be cancer but they must be checked by a primary care physician or a urologist your case may not be a cancer and it has got to be evaluated by an urologist or oncologist however please do not neglect and see your physician imediately  Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Intersex surgery Stomach cancer Ovarian cancer Breast cancer Medicine Urinary incontinence Testicular torsion Colorectal cancer Epididymitis Radiation therapy Malignant melanoma Brain tumor Lung cancer Endometrial cancer Mumps Syringomyelia Hypoglycemia Metastasis Castration Cervical cancer Penis Multiple sclerosis Soft tissue sarcoma Folic acid Medical analysis of circumcision Intersexuality Hypospadias Physical examination Abdominal pain Breastfeeding Breast Strap-on dildo Stroke Cancer of the larynx Growth hormone treatment Endometriosis Erogenous zone Obstetrics Esophageal cancer Pneumonia Sex organ Micropenis Menstrual cycle Gynaecology Renal cell carcinoma Epididymis Prolactinoma History of intersex surgery Sexual differentiation Mesothelioma Tocopherol Human chorionic gonadotropin Constipation Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Tobacco smoking Inguinal hernia Equine conformation Oral cancer Hernia History of anatomy in the 17th and 18th centuries Ovarian cyst Pain Cytomegalovirus Gonorrhoea Chlorpromazine Acromegaly Radiosurgery Sex toy Chronic fatigue syndrome Crohn's disease Masturbation Alcoholism Human penis size Delayed puberty Decompression sickness Fertility awareness Obesity Male reproductive system (human) Kidney Haloperidol Hyperthermia Spider Poliomyelitis

is high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion acquired through sexual contact doctors cannot always explain why one woman develops cervical cancer and another does not however we do know that a woman with certain risk factors may be more likely than others to develop cervical cancer a risk factor is something that may increase the chance of developing a disease studies have found a number of factors that may increase the risk of cervical cancer these factors may act together to increase the risk even more human papillomaviruses hpvs hpv infection is the main risk factor for cervical cancer hpv is a group of viruses that can infect the cervix hpv infections are very common these viruses can be passed from person to person through sexual contact most adults have been infected with hpv at some time in their lives some types of hpv can cause changes to cells in the cervix these changes can lead to genital warts cancer and other problems doctors may check for hpv even if there are no warts or other symptoms if a woman has an hpv infection her doctor can discuss ways to avoid infecting other people the pap test can detect cell changes in the cervix caused by hpv treatment of these cell changes can prevent cervical cancer there are several treatment methods including freezing or burning the infected tissue sometimes medicine also helps lack of regular pap tests cervical cancer is more common among women who do not have regular pap tests the pap test helps doctors find precancerous cells treating precancerous cervical changes often prevents cancer weakened immune system the body's natural defense system women with hiv the virus that causes aids infection or who take drugs that suppress the immune system have a higher than average risk of developing cervical cancer for these women doctors suggest regular screening for cervical cancer age cancer of the cervix occurs most often in women over the age of sexual history women who have had many sexual partners have a higher than average risk of developing cervical cancer also a woman who has had sexual intercourse with a man who has had many sexual partners may be at higher risk of developing cervical cancer in both cases the risk of developing cervical cancer is higher because these women have a higher than average risk of hpv infection smoking cigarettes women with an hpv infection who smoke cigarettes have a higher risk of cervical cancer than women with hpv infection who do not smoke using birth control pills for a long time using birth control pills for a long time or more years may increase the risk of cervical cancer among women with hpv infection having many children studies suggest that giving birth to many children may increase the risk of cervical cancer among women with hpv infection diethylstilbestrol des may increase the risk of a rare form of cervical cancer and certain other cancers of the reproductive system in daughters exposed to this drug before birth des was given to some pregnant women in the united states between about and it is no longer given to pregnant women women who think they may be at risk for cancer of the cervix should discuss this concern with their doctor they may want to ask about a schedule for checkups  Apoptosis Oral contraceptive Turner syndrome Miscarriage HIV Urinary incontinence Endometriosis AIDS pandemic HIV test Virus Endometrial cancer Menstrual cycle Common cold Mesothelioma Stroke Immune system Hepatitis B Pelvic inflammatory disease Hepatitis C Cervix Androgen insensitivity syndrome Crohn's disease Medicine Diethylstilbestrol AIDS in Africa Penile cancer Folic acid Toxoplasmosis Leukemia Childbirth Cancer of the larynx Acne Breastfeeding Rabies Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Multiple sclerosis Sexual intercourse Asthma Homosexuality and medical science In vitro fertilisation Tuberculosis Premature birth Homeopathy Diabetes mellitus Timeline of AIDS HIV vaccine Pregnancy Ovarian cancer Obstetrics Human sexual behavior Infertility Antiviral drug Autism Tobacco smoking Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus Vaccine Eczema Hypoglycemia Malignant melanoma Safe sex Traumatic brain injury Publicly funded medicine Infectious mononucleosis

can radiation therapy cure kill cancer of the liver external beam radiation is difficult to use with liver cancer due to the sensitivity of the normal liver it is difficult to deliver significantly high enough doses to kill the cancer in the liver without damaging the rest of the normal tissue so just a few years ago there was limited treatment for liver cancer but that has significantly changed there are now other treatments some based on radiation therapy others not that have been effective treatment for liver cancer depend on the stage of the disease and whether it is a primary or secondary cancer surgery is not always ruled out in the case of liver cancer the liver is able to regenerate itself and surgery is performed using a laser that will seal any type of bleeding as they go along so surgery is an option for liver cancer patients but many patients are now being treated with rfa chemoembolization and proton therapy some of the new tools now used to control or eliminate liver tumors include proton beam therapy a type of radiation that can be tightly controlled to deliver high dose radiation precisely to the correct location there is far more control using the proton beam since it can now focus directly on the tumor and spare the surrounding tissue not all liver cancer patients are candidates for this treatment proton beam therapy to liver http www medicinenet com proton beam therapy of liver article htm proton beam therapy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma hcc http www oncolink com conferences article cfm c s ss id radiofrequency ablation long thin electrode wires are guided by ct into a tumor a current is sent through the wire and heats the tumor which is than 'ablated' or 'disintegrates' this is non invasive tool can be done on smaller symetrically shaped nodules and tumors rfa of liver tumors http www radiologyinfo org en info cfm pg rfa bhcp chemoembolization a cathetar is used to deliver high dose chemotherapy directly into the liver instead of systemically chemoembolization of the liver http www radiologyinfo org en info cfm pg chemoembol there are other treatments including cryoblation isolated liver perfusion alcohol injection laser photocoagulation radiation beads and in some cases liver transplant not all patients are candidates for these treatments so they should be discussed with the oncologist as possible options  Cirrhosis Oncology Brain tumor Soft tissue sarcoma Folic acid Medicine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Esophageal cancer Stem cell Ionizing radiation Ovarian cancer Leukemia Thyroid cancer Diabetes mellitus Testicular cancer Endometrial cancer Psoriasis Positron emission tomography Atrial fibrillation Cervical cancer Acromegaly Proton therapy Hypoglycemia Mesothelioma Acoustic neuroma Stroke Hodgkin's lymphoma Multiple sclerosis History of cancer chemotherapy Acne X-ray Kaposi's sarcoma Magnetic resonance imaging Growth hormone treatment Multiple myeloma Osteosarcoma Aortic dissection Antiretroviral drug Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Paracetamol Growth hormone Diazepam Insulin Haloperidol Hepatitis Radiology Chlorpromazine Gene therapy Immunosuppressive drug DNA repair Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Wilms' tumor Bupropion Computed tomography Homeopathy Penile cancer Clomipramine Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Anemia Androgen insensitivity syndrome Nuclear fusion Polycythemia AIDS Radiation poisoning Alcoholism Chondrosarcoma Tocopherol Gynecomastia Directed-energy weapon Crohn's disease Chronic fatigue syndrome Syringomyelia Particle accelerator Tuberculosis Herpes simplex virus Interferon

has anyone recovered from high dose chemo and stem cell transplant with renal failure for germ cell cancer just curious my husband is still recovering although the cancer isn't completely gone he needs dialysis now and occasionally more blood for low platelets he's pretty tired slow moving we have to watch his diet i'm not sure what your question is but yes people have recovered from high dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant usually the doctors explain this process and the fact that there is no guarantee with this treatment it is a chance much depends on his overall health but i would be more concerned that the cancer is not completely gone my understanding is that stem cell transplant is used as the period at the end of treatment if he still has cancer present than further treatment options may now be limited we decided not to do stem cell transplant once this was explained to us it is something that is best used when there is minimal or no detectable disease present we still have the option of going to this treatment once the disease is smaller  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer Prostate cancer Chemotherapy Bone marrow transplant Stomach cancer Folic acid Stem cell Multiple myeloma Diabetes mellitus Radiation therapy Colorectal cancer Lung cancer Myelodysplastic syndrome Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Leukemia Growth hormone treatment Dialysis Paracetamol Hypertension Endometriosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cirrhosis Multiple sclerosis Coeliac disease Hypoglycemia Lupus erythematosus Nephrology Medicine Immunosuppressive drug Ionizing radiation Stroke Diabetic nephropathy Renal cell carcinoma Thrombocytopenia Liver Polycythemia Acute renal failure IgA nephropathy Vitamin C Organ transplant Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Psoriasis Chronic renal failure Rabies Tocopherol Atherosclerosis Testicular cancer Vitamin D Hodgkin's lymphoma History of cancer chemotherapy Schistosomiasis Metastasis Malaria Glycogen storage disease type I Antiretroviral drug Nutrition Erythropoietin Wilson's disease Cytomegalovirus Duesberg hypothesis Atheroma Omega-3 fatty acid Ovarian cancer Mesothelioma Crohn's disease Malignant melanoma Homeopathy Soft tissue sarcoma Androgen insensitivity syndrome Human cloning Alcoholism Thyroid cancer Platelet Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Brain tumor American Red Cross Chronic fatigue syndrome Gene therapy Glucocorticoid Goodpasture's syndrome Chronic lymphocytic leukemia Positron emission tomography Cord blood Baldness treatments Cancer of the larynx Esophageal cancer Kaposi's sarcoma Traditional Chinese medicine Radiosurgery DNA repair Experimental cancer treatment

what do you know about cancer when it's in it's th stage cancer is a progressive disease that starts out small and advances to a large tumor capable of shedding microscopic cells into the blood stream or lymphatic system this is called metastatic cancer because those small malignant cells can start new tumors in a distant location from the original tumor there is treatment for all stages of cancer including stage iv stage iv is difficult to treat because the disease is so widespread but it is not impossible in general depending on the type of cancer and the patients age and overall health there is a multi modality treatment consisting of chemotherapy surgery and radiation the purpose of chemotherapy is to try shrink and kill as many tumors as possible there can be a few or literally hundreds at various sizes chemotherapy is also systemic and follows the same path that microscopic cancer cells follow it's hoped that chemo will kill any small or microscopic cells lurking in the body illustration of the four stages of colon cancer http www fightcolorectalcancer org images diagram stages jpg radiation is used to shrink and kill tumors that are in one location it is more difficult to use raditiation with stage iv disease because often the cancer is to widepread surgery is the modality used to remove and resect all visible tumors it is possible for surgery to completely eliminate all signs of disease the problem often is that in advanced tumors the disease has wrapped itself around vital organs intertwined into blood vessels or is located in a region considered inoperable there are other treatments available for stage iv disease radiofrequency ablation can disintegrate liver tumors gamma knife can be used successfully on brain tumors proton therapy can exactly pinpoint a tumor and spare surrounding tissue chemoperfusion is heated and placed directly into the tumor bed autologous peripherial blood stem cell transplant bone marrow transplant and experimental clinical trials it is becomming possible for some patients with advanced cancer to find meds to stablize and control their tumors thereby making cancer a chronic disease  Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Thyroid cancer Hepatocellular carcinoma Ovarian cancer Folic acid Cervical cancer Osteosarcoma Multiple sclerosis Diabetes mellitus Wilms' tumor Testicular cancer Tuberculosis Kaposi's sarcoma Gastrointestinal stromal tumor History of cancer chemotherapy Chronic lymphocytic leukemia Traumatic brain injury Cirrhosis Stroke AIDS Blood Acromegaly Myelodysplastic syndrome Crohn's disease Endometrial cancer Ewing's sarcoma DNA repair Liver Penile cancer Rheumatoid arthritis Growth hormone treatment Organ transplant Immune system Atherosclerosis Hypoglycemia Immunosuppressive drug Hematological malignancy Acoustic neuroma Prolactinoma Apoptosis Cancer of the larynx Endometriosis Kidney Growth hormone Aortic dissection Chronic myelogenous leukemia Chronic fatigue syndrome Endocrinology Anemia Lupus erythematosus Lymphatic system Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Magnetic resonance imaging Malaria Neurofibromatosis type I Insulin Carcinogenesis Psoriasis Human cloning Gene therapy Mastocytosis Neurofibromatosis type II Schistosomiasis Pneumonia Physical therapy Cholesterol IgA nephropathy Transplant rejection Androgen insensitivity syndrome Immunology Pancreatic cancer

a friend of mine is going to die what do i do i posted a while back about my friend who has one leg and was a cancer survivor well about four months ago he was re diagnosed with lung cancer doctors tell us he has six months to live with an up coming surgery and a new form of experimental chemotherapy i have about six months to prepare for his death though i don't trust doctor's time tables simply because my grandfather died of lung cancer and lasted years longer than expected right now he's fine and fit and we hang out almost every day but what should i do each day gets harder for me to look at him last night he spent the night and i threw up i blamed it on something i ate but i knew it was because of him dying what do i do i thank all of you for your suggestions i think i will see my pastor about this i will keep praying and i will live everyday to the fullest with him i didn't make my self clear earlier but both of us are only so hospice isn't need but i do have a previous knowledge of hospice due to my grandfather i will read those stories and take this one step at a time thank you all i'm sorry your friend has to go through this and i'm sorry you are having such a difficult time your reactions are understandable first your friend is fighting this disease and seems to be focusing on living right now that's great however even though he may not be talking a lot about his illness it probably weighs very heavily on his mind as it does on yours if you'd like to talk about it with him it may help both of you to do so ask him if he'd like to talk about it take your cues from him at the very least it would probably be safe to let him know that you care even if you can't get beyond that sentence second check into some resources for yourself and for how to help your friend your friend is fighting his cancer so you might want to check out some inspirational stories they may give both of you hope start with the lung cancer stories at the care pages website link below care pages allows family and friends of sick people to build a web log about their progress and there are a lot of resources there finally if treatment is not successful or you'd like to learn more about how to interact with a friend who's dying check out the hospice link below hospice is a nationwide network of organizations that help people die at home among family with dignity there is lots of helpful information at the link on simple ways to be a part of your friend's life during this time and on how to get through this experience yourself my thoughts are with you and your friend  Prostate cancer Palliative care Stomach cancer Cancer Medicine Theory of conduct Lung cancer Religious Society of Friends Psychology Metastasis Church of Christ, Scientist Breast cancer Plame affair Terri Schiavo Causality Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Autism rights movement Pitaten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fight Club Stroke Hearing impairment Radiation therapy American Red Cross Social rule Time Out of Mind Folic acid Oncology Andy Kaufman Multiple sclerosis Milton H.

the worlds best health care is here in the u s is statement propaganda a friend of mine was diagnosed with liver cancer early this year and given less than a year to live by his doctors without alot of hope of recovery he had cancer in his liver and it was in his blood stream and in some of his bones the doctors wanted to do some surgerys and kimo and were telling him it was gona be a long road without any kind of gaurantee some where my friend heard of a hospital in india where they specialized in liver treatments because of the high rate of hepatitus in that part of the world so he speant all of his savings and flew to india where they did several procedures with a lazor i just talked to him for the first time yesterday and can't remember alot of the details he came home to the states and went to his doctor when they ran tests the found his body cancer free when he told him what had happened the didn't believe him and said that no such procedure existed they also wanted to still do kemo is it all the legal red tape if you are referring to radiofrequency ablation cyber knife or proton therapy all these treatments exist in the us for cancer patients the problem is that many cancer patients because of the size and location of their specific disease may not qualify for the treatment what this means is that an oncologist will determine after a conference with the radiologist or medical technician if the tumors can safely be eliminated using the above methods if they determine that you would not benefit from this treatment they couldn't get all the tumor out safely than they will in general refuse the treatment radio frequency ablation of liver tumors http www radiologyinfo org en info cfm pg rfa bhcp proton therapy http www radiologyinfo org en info cfm pg protonthera cyberknife liver treatment http www accuray com clinicalinfo applications liver index aspx laser surgery is used routinely on the liver here in the states too my son had this done when they removed a few tumors from the dome of his liver i have no idea what happened to your friend and why he would go to india when treatment is available here perhaps he just did not know who to contact and was more familiar with india if your friend used interstitial laser photocoagulation it is often bypassed for treatment options in the us because rfa and cryotherapy can kill more tumors than this process so it may be less of a matter of 'red tape' and more a matter that newer treatments have replaced this technique and his doctors here were correct there is no guarantee just because a test comes back with 'no evidence' of the disease does not mean that it is gone at best it means that he is in remission and the ct can no longer detect microscopic cancer hopefully he will stay in remission but there is no guarantee that it is gone the reason his doctors recommended chemotherapy was to kill off those lingering microscopic cells remaining in the body malignant microscopic cells can stay hidden and dormant for an undetermined amount of years so he will need to be vigilant i'm glad that your friend is better and that he found the treatment that has helped him sometimes it is more a matter of where someone feels the most comfortable and i do believe that cancer patients in the us are receiving some of the newest and more progressive cancer treatments than any place else in the world i've done alot of reseach and have talked to people and patients from all over the world and i'm satisfied with my son's health care there are some exceptions depending on the specific types of cancer but overall cancer research and access to new treatments here is topnotch  Malaria Stem cell Stroke Folic acid Mesothelioma Bone marrow transplant Hepatocellular carcinoma Hypoglycemia Multiple sclerosis Transsexuality Esophageal cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ovarian cancer Testicular cancer AIDS Traditional Chinese medicine Pneumonia Homeopathy Urinary incontinence Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Tuberculosis Multiple myeloma Traumatic brain injury Cirrhosis Psoriasis Endometriosis Magnetic resonance imaging Clinical depression Chiropractic Leukemia Cytomegalovirus Coeliac disease Brain tumor Radiology Prolactinoma Growth hormone treatment Rheumatoid arthritis Cervical cancer Alternative medicine Rabies Experimental cancer treatment Atrial fibrillation DNA repair Chronic fatigue syndrome Acne Crohn's disease Gastrointestinal stromal tumor Androgen insensitivity syndrome Autism Medical analysis of circumcision History of cancer chemotherapy Physical therapy Antiretroviral drug Tocopherol AIDS reappraisal Liver Publicly funded medicine Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cryptorchidism Positron emission tomography Bipolar disorder Cancer of the larynx X-ray Technetium Medical cannabis Dialysis American Red Cross Photorefractive keratectomy Physician Alcoholism Insulin Osteosarcoma Hepatitis C HIV test Involuntary commitment Church of Christ, Scientist Penile cancer

i don't know how to help my partner any suggestions my boyfriends dad has just been told he has up to months left to live with oesophagus cancer it has devastated him as he has already lost his mum and i cannot cope with seeing him so upset his dad means alot to me as well as we have been together for yrs but as soon as i start to speak about it i cry and i want so much to be strong for them both how can i take control of my feelings without avoiding the subject it's hard to lose someone you love the reason you are crying so much is that you are grieving most people think that grieving begins after a person dies but that's not true it can begin as early as getting the diagnosis of the illness so what you are going through is perfectly normal however since your boyfriend's dad has about a year or so left to live it won't be healthy for you to continue in the state you're in now so it would be a good idea for you to have someone to talk to we have hospices here where i live and you can go to support groups with other people who are losing someone they love it doesn't cost anything here so if they have hospices where you live and i think they do try to find a support group where you can talk about your feelings are you able to talk to his dad about other topics without crying if you can then be there for him people who are dying don't always want to talk about dying they also want to continue living as normal a life as possible trust me when i say i know this to be true what kinds of things does he like you have known him for a long time i'm sure he would love visits and you can bring him things you know he likes even if it's something as simple as the daily papers i'm sure he'd love to simply have your company that's worth so much as far as helping your boyfriend again just be there for him if he's feeling sad just hold him if you cannot speak if he talks to you about his dad listen to him and it's ok if you cry when you talk maybe he needs to cry so your crying makes it easier for him to cry i'll say again that i think you need someone to talk to also you want to be strong for them and that's wonderful but who's going to be strong for you you are grieving too when your boyfriend's dad has months left he can belong to a hospice that doesn't mean he has to move anywhere he can stay at home but he will have care both physically emotionally hospices send a nurse about times a week to check in on the patient more often if they need it they will send aides if the patient needs care with bathing dressing making up the bed etc the hospice will also have counseling available to him your boyfriend you so maybe you could be the one to start looking into this that would be one way to help them and yourself and as i said you can go to hospice support groups now because you need help for yourself you are important too and you'll be able to help them better if you have help for yourself i'm sorry you have to go through such a painful time just try to make it through one day at a time it's sad when someone we love dies but there is one positive thing to hold on to he didn't die suddenly which can be even harder because there is no time to say goodbye you your boyfriend have a year to be with him and you can share your love during this time be together while preparing to say goodbye best of luck to you and take care of yourself  Social rule Palliative care Pitaten Prostate cancer EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Grief Terri Schiavo About a Boy Kodocha Theory of conduct Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma One Tree Hill (TV series) The Amber Spyglass Jon Secada Friends Grandview, U.S.A.

why would someone do this why would a person ask what's your favorite kind of cancer what brings on this kind of ignorance unsensitivity and carelessness of others feelings if you don't know what i'm talking about check the questions i've answered on my profile allahfeat themasters was the person that asked that ignorant question rolls her eyes in disgust i have had cancer and there is a place for humour among cancer patients and survivors and don't forget 'survivors' live with the fear of a recurrence there is often a dark gallows humour that we refer to as 'tumour humour' but this isn't an example of that it's an adolescent attempt to shock and get attention elsewhere in ya this kid tells how he laughs when he hears the words 'gang rape' a particularly obnoxious adolescent but presumably he'll grow up eventually shame we have to put up with his crap in the meantime  Milton H.

could this be cancer my mom has lost weight like crazy within the last year she's basically skin and bones now and no matter how much she eats she can't gain any weight she is in constant pain and has trouble walking and moving she has these bumps on some of her bones that stick out and cause her pain and seem to keep appearing in new places she is constantly exhausted to the point where she can't even sit up for too long without having to lie down she also has this pain in her abdomen that comes and goes throughout the day that she says feels like stabbing pains no matter how hard i try i can't get her to agree to go and see a doctor and i'm not sure what to do could this be cancer btw she's been a smoker for at least years i really don't appreciate being called a cruel child you have no idea how hard i've been trying and what i've been doing for her i think it is cruel to call me cruel when i'm sitting here watching my mother go thru this and not being able to do anything to help her i truly hope you don't treat your patients and their families like that yes it most definitely could be cancer there's really no way you can make her see a doctor against her will what you can do is tell her that you are seriously concerned about her symptoms and sudden weight loss and that you are fearing the worst then tell her it would really mean a lot to you if she would see her doctor for a diagnosis to put your mind at ease beyond that there's nothing you can do if she still won't go as hard as it's going to be you'll just have to accept her decision and realize that it's her body her life her decision i am in no way discouraging you from trying to convince her to get to a doctor please try all you can to get her to go and find out what's going on but if she refuses then just respect her choice i wish you and your mom the best  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Prostate cancer Medicine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cancer Milton H.

do you give to cancer charities as a disease that effects a large percentage of the population i have many many times given money towards research into this however i have been watching news reports that state cancer patients are having to pay for cancer treatment drugs out of there own pockets as the goverment claims the cost of giving them on the nhs would be too costly i know that i was donating into the research side of it but why should people with cancer have to pay for these drugs when so much money is put towards cancer charities yes good for you for donating to cancer research don't ever stop that in itself makes you part of the solution rather than part of the problem unfortunately our elected officials don't consider cancer to be the problem that it actually is our children can't vote they can't defend themselves from the ravages of cancer yet they will ultimately suffer from the budget cuts and general apathy that exists our gov't has slashed pediatric cancer funding while our children the most vulnerable sector of our society continue to die at a rate of more than every hours from cancer and cancer related side effects that's every hours of every day of every week of every month you will read about improved survival rates what you usually do not read about is that a high percentage of these cured children have life long disabilities as a result of their toxic exposure to outdated chemotherapies and radiation many of them will die from those exposures without people like you helping to support the research necessary to undertake clinical trials there can be no new therapies and these kids are caught in a vicious balancing act of how to kill the cancer without killing the patient it's not getting better the incidence of these pediatric cancers has gone up every year since the 's in children will eventually contract some form of cancer before their th birthday in will die this has to stop and if our gov't has decided that it is more important to stockpile missiles than to save our children then who will step up and fill the void you will this is critical this is not something that just happens to someone else this will eventually catch up with all of us it has already caught up with my family we lost our year old son months ago to wilms' tumor kidney cancer  Radiation therapy Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Lung cancer Publicly funded medicine Mesothelioma Breast cancer Oncology Colorectal cancer Folic acid Psoriasis Multiple sclerosis Palliative care Growth hormone treatment Chemotherapy Duesberg hypothesis Health insurance History of cancer chemotherapy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Bone marrow transplant Alternative medicine Chernobyl accident Stroke Thimerosal Experimental cancer treatment Medicine Wilms' tumor Soft tissue sarcoma Metastasis Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Clinical depression National Kidney Foundation Singapore Food and Drug Administration National Institutes of Health Chronic fatigue syndrome Psychiatric hospital Brain tumor Autism Hepatocellular carcinoma Medical analysis of circumcision Haloperidol Crohn's disease Asthma Tocopherol Divorce AIDS Malignant melanoma AIDS reappraisal Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Mother Teresa Ovarian cancer Cryptorchidism Medical cannabis Hypoglycemia Tobacco smoking Hodgkin's lymphoma Migraine Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus DNA repair Autism epidemic Baldness Hypertension Esophageal cancer Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Herpes simplex virus Cervical cancer Multiple myeloma Alcoholics Anonymous Breastfeeding Barbara Boxer National Health Service Adverse effect (medicine) Renal cell carcinoma Chlorpromazine Transsexuality Radiation poisoning Diabetes mellitus Androgen insensitivity syndrome Testicular cancer Antiretroviral drug Theory of conduct Vitamin C Organ transplant
