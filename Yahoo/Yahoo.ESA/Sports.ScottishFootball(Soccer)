rangers sectarian singing any thoughts first of all i agree that alot of the songs which are sung away from ibrox and celtic park should be banned however looking at the words of the sash and derry walls this is a celebration song and doesnt even mention the word fenian or catholic it mentions rebel but hey so what also my fellow gers colleagues complain about the soldier song this is not sectarian either as it is the republic of irelands national anthem and celtic origins are from there so really the last line sums it up i believe celtic and rangers fans follow the tradition of two seperate countries and celebrate it by singing and parades aoh and orange order parades i really think that there is too much focus on this from uefa and sfa there is more in the world to worry about by the way who cares about celtic players blessing themselves big deal now i realize that not all rangers fans are vicious bigots thanks geeboy p s i'm a celtic fan  Celtic F.C.

are hearts still a scottish team shouldn't they change their name to lithuanians on loan fc has vladomir romanov made or bust heart of midlothian lithuanians are not exactly very talented players and i don't think it is a good idea for romanov to sign so many hearts had a good chance at being a top team but with players that are most likely to struggle in the scottish league the team will also struggle it's like arsenal and the french players should change their name too it's disappointing when clubs sign a majority of foreign players especially in the case of hearts where the players won't help the clubs challenge there are so many better young scottish players out there who should be given the chance  Heart of Midlothian F.C. 2005-06 in Scottish football Alex Ferguson West Bromwich Albion F.C.
