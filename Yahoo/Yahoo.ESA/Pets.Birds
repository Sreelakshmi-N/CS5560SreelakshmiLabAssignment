would it be okay to house a baby parrot in a small cage until he gets older i'm bringing home my new redbelly senegal soon and was wondering if it would be okay to house him her in a small cage for about a month or before i put him in his big cage so that he won't be able to hurt himself in anyway because the breeder says that sometimes baby parrots will climb to the top of their cage and would not know how to get down and sometimes hurt themselves what do you think but he will not even be completely weaned when i bring him home he is barely months he can bite through the wires of a small cage already becuase i just bought a big wrought iron cage for him but don't want to put him in yet because i dont know if he'll climb and hurt himself and stuff so its better if i just put him in the big cage you don't mention how small the cage is and that could mean different things to different people i would not house a red belly or a senegal they are two different species in anything smaller than x x tall for any amount of time and i hope the bar spacing of your permanent wrought iron cage is no more than apart otherwise the your bird could attempt to squeeze through and wind up getting stuck what really concerns me though is the fact that your question makes me feel you are not super knowledgable about parrots in general and i wonder why the breeder would allow you to bring home an un weaned baby bird the weaning process and proper socialization is not that simple the other thing that doesn't sound good to me is the breeder telling you that the bird may not know how to climb down from the top of its cage climbing is part of the learning process in a bird and if it does get to the top i assume you mean hanging upside down from the underside of the top of a cage nothing too terrible could really happen other than it continues hanging until you come to rescue it yes it could fall but not likely birds are not stupid and are usually quite courageous in years or owning and breeding birds i've never found a baby bird in that predicament i have found them with legs or wings caught between too small of bar spacing though so your bar spacing is indeed an important consideration for any cage temporary or permanent i think you would do well to do some additional book reading or internet research before you bring your new baby home because just asking this one question is not the only thing you are going to need to know for giving your bird the best possible care and i'm not sure that the breeder is giving you all the correct knowledge either good luck and feel free to email me if you would care to  Hamster Domestic rabbit Breastfeeding John Cage Ferret RuneScape quests Professional wrestling match types Aerial (dance move) Guinea pig Poker jargon Chicken Paragliding Equine conformation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Infantilism Chocobo Mealy Parrot Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The Shining (film) Characters in the Smurfs Glossary of climbing terms Piccolo Junior Saga Shaggy dog story Burrhus Frederic Skinner Blood on the Tracks Pok__mon Live!

a baby what age is a good age toi get the parrot at im aware of what it needs as far as housing and toys and enrichment as far as playing with the bird i have also located a good avain vet thats relatively in my area im just wondering what anyones expierences are with these birds i also know of the many subspecies timneh erithacus and the princeps what can you tell me about each im just trying to get as much info from people that have these birds i have done a lot of research on the internet but first hand expierence from real owners would be greatly appreciated thanks everyone for all the speedy responses i was just wondering if they will be ok with other pets in the house i have a bullmastiff who is very mellow and a legged cat that i rescued they both get along almost to well and was wondering how these birds might react to other pets as far as doing my homework i am very well aware of the specific needs of these animals i am a student at cornell veterinary so yes i have done my homework literally i know of all the things to do to keep the bird healthy as far as dietary needs and medical examinations i am just trying to hear first hand expierences with these birds as far as how they would fit in my family texas haha thats great awesome story susan thanks for the info i never intend to get any animal and leave them in thier cage my bullmastiff was crate trained as a puppy and when i wanted to fold the crate up and just let her have the run of the house she gopt very upset so the only reason my dog still even has a crate is because its her security blanket hahah she is like linus without his blanky i was just concerned that the bird would try to bite the dog or the cat because when i am home i intend to always let the animals have the run of the house the only animals i have that stay put are my fish so the main concern is if the bird is early socialized with the dog and the cat would they be able to get along i dont want to have the dog bark and traumatize the bird and in return have the bird compulsively pull out its feathers susan thanks for the info i never intend to get any animal and leave them in thier cage my bullmastiff was crate

and traumatize the bird and in return have the bird compulsively pull out its feathers i've had one for years now and mine isn't really noisy my conure makes far more racket but he is a talker he picks up everything including some things i wish he'd forget fat chance they've got the memory of an elephant they say africans have the cognitive ability of a year old human child mine certainly does he not only says words but whole sentences and he doesn't just mindlessly repeat sounds like most parrots do he not only knows what to say but exactly when to say it once when i had his cage by a window he pulled the curtain into his cage to play with shredded the damn thing too i pulled it out and bogie went right back and pulled it in again then i moved his cage about a foot from the window and the curtain or what was left of it anyway so he goes back ready to do it again reached the bars and realized he couldn't turned to look at me cocked his head and said well sh t i was practically rolling on the floor laughing he also imitates my wife when she's on the phone our bedroom is right next to bogie's room so he gets a real earful sometimes one afternoon my wife and i were changing the sheets on our bed when we heard bogie in the next room in a perfect immitation of my wife's voice hello oh hi lisa my wife's sister how are you noooooo you're trippin' girl i told my wife she'd never be able to cheat on me as long as bogie was alive he'd rat her out in a new york minute he also does noises other than speech and africans are such perfect mimics it's like that old commercial for recording tape is it real or is it memorex he immitates my wife's dog so well the first time i heard him i thought the dog had gotten shut in bogie's room a bus used to go past our house early in the morning and turned the next corner as soon as it passed it had very squeaky brakes and every morning at we heard the driver apply those brakes right in front of our house you could have set your watch by him well bogie did those brakes so well you'd swear that bus was going down my upstairs hall bottom line you'll never be sorry you got an african  EastEnders African Grey Parrot RuneScape

are albino animals generally as healthy as regular animals i got an albino bird yesterday just curious it's just a parakeet i have noticed that birds with white feathers are more susceptible to external parasite damage such as lice because there is a lack of melanin pigments that would normally reinforce the feather structure also their eyes have no pigment so they have more trouble seeing especially in bright sun becuase it penetrates deeper with no pigment to reflect off of however if it is a parakeet in a cage inside i dont think you have much to worry about  Albinism Eye color Pigment Melanin Human skin color Conure Color Chicken Budgerigar Ultraviolet Heterochromia Dog Cat coat genetics Thermoregulation Monk Parakeet Red-masked Parakeet Egg (food) Egg (biology) Carnivorous plant Sun tanning Hair color Hamster Cheetah Peafowl Dinosaur Color vision Cuttlefish Retina Animal testing Carolina Parakeet Chlorophyta Sunscreen Fancy rat Black supremacy Animal Chameleon Sun Dobermann Nuclear explosion Leaf White Tooth Crocodilia Reptile Hair Sunlight Feather Alexandrine Parakeet White tiger Ostrich Domesticated turkey Plum-headed Parakeet Hair coloring Eye Sperm Whale Parrot Penguin Bird strike Nuwaubianism Guinea pig White buffalo Staining (biology) Bird Acanthocephala Sleep Tooth enamel Black Myxobolus cerebralis The Time Machine Lapis lazuli Macular degeneration Mealy Parrot Chromium Black panther Blood Rose-ringed Parakeet Yami to B__shi to Hon no Tabibito Primary color Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Motorcycle helmet Horse Human Pneumonia Camp Lazlo Uncanny Valley Tuatara Blue Jay Radiation therapy Melasma Pet Skin Piccolo Junior Saga Xenomorph Hyacinth Macaw Discus (fish) Race House Mouse Fish farming Paint

first time bird owner here any tips for handling a lovebird through some confusion i somehow ended up with a parrot rather than a ferret which i originally wanted my mom's co worker gave him to me we were too scared to offend her so my mom said we'd give him a week before we returned him this is only day one i've read up on some general care for lovebirds i do plan on reading more i don't want him to be bored or anything so i'm attempting to pick him up interact with him more but everytime i open the cage i get freaked out because of his beak any tips i know i'm sort of expecting him to bite me how hard is it gonna hurt he's only months so he's pretty young every time i try to get near enough to pick him up he moves farther away i guess he's still adjusting it may hurt a little bit but it shouldn't slice the skin nor hurt the bone like some of the larger parrots can do they can nip pretty hard if they are scared but usually a warning nip doesn't hurt too much if he does bite don't pull back nor cry you have grab his beak between your thumb and pointer fringer's knuckle and say no firmly if he is hand fed he should adjust quickly but it if it is a lovebird that was mostly just decoration you may or may not be able to handle him in a week there are lot pf people that own lovebirds and say they make great pets but it is only if they are hand fed offer millet when you put your hand in the cage if you have millet hanging in the cage take it out he will be more likely to go to your hand for it if he can't already get it in his cage move slowly and talk to him in a calm voice parrots are hard to keep if you aren't interested but it sounds like you are doing everything just fine just be patient with him and eventually you will see his true personality  Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Aerial (dance move) Pet skunk Dog training The Birds (film) Electrophysiology Ferret Kodocha EastEnders Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Guinea pig Wheel of Fortune RuneScape quests Sin City The Inside The Legend of Zelda series enemies StarCraft: Uprising Equine conformation Chicken Drill bit Kim Possible Tenshinhan Hamster Domestic rabbit Knife Lovebird Salad Fingers Skateboarding trick Kakapo Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Time Out of Mind Kender Mealy Parrot The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie African Grey Parrot Ron and Fez Cat Eric Cartman Chopsticks Milton H.

why does a rooster crow at dawn we have a rooster near us that goes off at just about anytime of the day or night is this normal like all birds roosters sing or crow as the case may be in a daily cycle almost all animals have daily cycles of activity known as circadian rhythms a rooster crows because he has an internal clock that helps him anticipate sunrise that way he knows when to begin his daily hunt for food and defense of his territory but if one rooster in the neighbor has an internal clock that s set a little early he can stimulate other roosters to crow early too the rooster s sunrise song is actually a way of establishing his territory when a rooster crows he s sending a signal to other roosters that if they trespass they re asking for a fight a rooster will often crow from a vantage point above his territory so he can make others more aware of his presence and so that his songs travel farther often nightlights floodlights or other artificial lighting will throw off the animals natural rhythm and he will crow when it is not daylight dawn yet  Chicken Circadian rhythm Cock (chicken) Sleep Day Daylight saving time Cockfight Sheryl Crow Insomnia Stage lighting Crime prevention through environmental design Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography USS Tunny (SS-282) Alice in Chains Delayed sleep phase syndrome Biorhythm Chinese astrology Navigation Canonical hours Twilight Solar eclipse Millennium Group Chinese calendar Hunting Japanese New Year Australian rules football Drosophila melanogaster Europe Gospel music Suprachiasmatic nucleus Julian day Urinary incontinence Journey (band) Menstrual cycle Softball South Australian National Football League Time dilation Onomatopoeia The Vile Village Fertility awareness Atomic clock South Sydney Rabbitohs Doo-wop Capoeira Melatonin Sundial Jazz Time signal Time American popular music Capercaillie Denizli Province Mike the Headless Chicken NRBQ Birth control Siesta Cardiac arrhythmia Atlanta Campaign Sioux Uprising Sunset Intellectual history of time Legend of Zelda series songs Clock Ecco the Dolphin Cat Hiking Music video Eye Light pollution Vehicular cycling Progressive rock Native American music Tlingit Gallium Breastfeeding Honeybee Howlin' Wolf Estrus cycle Genesis (band) Haibane Renmei Vitamin C Earthworm Timekeeping on Mars Animal communication Nutrition Central processing unit Solar time Chronobiology Victorian Football League Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Harry Nilsson James Brown (musician) Music history of the United States Cray-1 Rush (band) Aliasing Artificial pacemaker Time zone Toledo Strip

parakeet finger training help my three parakeets are like attatched like glue and never let me take them out of the room seperartly i can hold each one there since i keep my cage top of because i don't want to make them feel trapped i play music for them when i'm gone and sometime they let me hold them i have to take my birds out of the room with force if i don't want to play with one in there and once there out they keep chirping to each other plus i could give them each kisses while in the room any suggestions real ones please i'm not quit understanding what your asking but i'm going to assume your talking about your budgies are not bonding with you just each other this will happen when they're all in the same cage or if you only have one and you put a mirror in the cage they'll bond with the other bird and not you if this is the problem you're having you'll need to put your budgies in separate cages and work with each one separately in a quiet room away from distractions do this for about mins to minutes a few times a day after about the first week i'd up the alone time to mins and before long you'll be able to give each budgie the technical name for a parakeet their alone time while they're all in the same room they most likely will still chirp to one another but this is what birds do it's not something you can stop them from doing it is their instinct good luck  John Cage Professional wrestling match types Hamster Monk Parakeet Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Jason Reso Milton H.

is my mourning dove sick okay today i was out in my front yard giving away some troublesome toads i'd caught to the neighborhood kids when a couple little girls came rushing to me asking me for help they had found a baby bird and knowing me i went to investigate well the bird had been in water and from first glance i recognized it as a common mourning dove i took it home and dried it off making sure it had a nice warm place to sleep i filled a box with peices of cloth and very soft guinea pig bedding afterwards i did some research i found that this bird was old enough to fly it was just to ill to do so and so i began to watch over it the birds droppings are a very light yellow color and rather runny which indicated that the bird was either suffering from anorexia or liver problems i tried feeding it but the bird wouldn't stomach the slurry or any of the other foods i provided the bird also had a big open sore on his face so i gauzed it does anyone know what's wrong with it contact a licensed wildlife rehabilitator you can find one here http www tc umn edu devo contact htm please under no circumstances attempt to care for the bird yourself first off if it is suffering from liver problems it needs medical attention that you are not qualified to give furthermore there is so much more to rehabilitation than keeping the animal alive until you think it is ready to be released you have to know not only what to feed the bird but how please do not attempt to give the bird any liquid by dropper baby birds can aspirate and die how much and how often you also have to know how to assess the birds general health and condition a baby bird kept in captivity must be taught to recognize and find the type of food it will eat in the wild if it is being hand fed it may not associate the bugs and berries and seeds in nature as being food it must also have the opportunity to exercise its wings a lot so it will be able to fly on or shortly after release when i volunteered at the avian rehabilitation center we kept the rehabilitating fledglings in a large walk in cage with lots of shelves and branches leading from one shelf to the other and down to the ground we would place different types of food in the cage for them as they were being weaned from the hand feeding formula we offered seed meal worms and chopped up fruit no fledgling was released until it was eating on its own had sufficient weight gain had all of its flight feathers in good condition had no sign of diarreah or nasal discharge had clear eyes and could fly at least a few feet in a straight line these are the reasons to get the bird to a licensed rehabilitator they have the training and the resources necessary to do all this in addition to having the permits to do it all legally all native migratory birds in the us are protected under the migratory bird treaty act and you must have the proper permits to have them even for a short time even for good reasons like saving them many other countries also have similar laws regarding their native species  Hamster Chicken Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Breastfeeding Falconry Fancy rat Bird H5N1 Kakapo Albatross Common cold Seabird Foie gras Anorexia nervosa Capercaillie Pet skunk Hedgehog Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Mealy Parrot Hemp Dog Insulin Animal testing Livestock RuneScape quests Hunting Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Orca Terri Schiavo Tetrapod Poker jargon Obesity Kashrut Diabetes mellitus Spider Dinosaur Vegetarianism Stomach cancer Acorn Trapping Aerial (dance move) Equine conformation Genetically modified food Nurse Taikyoku shogi Mattress Ferret Urinary incontinence Tofu Peanut Dog agility Salad Fingers Medicine Dairy Fugu Drowning Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Decompression sickness Tsetse fly Vermicompost Elephant Gray Wolf Species Fasting Archery Nuclear power Characters of Naruto Sleep Bat Health insurance Garfield Peafowl Airport Prostate cancer Dieting Dodo Shrimp farm First aid Swimming Pysanka Bird ringing Insurance Professional wrestling aerial techniques Apple Chocobo Tomato Peregrine Falcon

bleeding bird help i just got home from work and saw that my parakeet jasmine was bleeding near the left eye there are only two ways i could guess it could happen one is if my other parakeet jacob caused it in a fight jacob drew blood on me before so i know his bite is powerful enough the other possibility would be that she cut it on accident while scratching herself the cut still looks fresh so i guess the main question is if birds will naturally heal from a cut or if they need any kind of help their nails dont look long but i'm going to cut them this week just to be safe but if i see jacob hurt her again if he did hurt her in the first place he is gone into his natural habitat you can buy a sceptic stick from pet store that stops bleeding it will heal thoughnaturally unless bad then it needs to be stopped i would keep the birds separate when out of the house and let them loose when i was in to watch them check their toys and perches for sharp edges  Hamster Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Wound Episodes of Lost (Season 1) CPU cache Bleeding Monk Parakeet Blood (computer game) Budgerigar Parrot Stomach cancer Guinea pig Poker jargon First aid Password Milton H.

parakeet talking i am getting a parakeet tomarrow but it is a baby i want it to talk because i always wanted a talking bird i know that you have to earn it's trust do you have any ideas on what how help them learn example making wood blocks to teach them shapes yay my website www prettiep t com and yes they can talk a young male three four months of age is ideal males are better talkers to teach a bird to talk you will need time dedication and above all patience all the birds i have trained said their first word s at the end of three weeks intensive training the key to teaching a parakeets to talk is to have the parakeet think it's part of the human flock and therefore that it needs to communicate with its human friends if you have a mirror in the cage or other parakeets it will see parakeets around it and want to talk like them i e chirp so step one is to have your young parakeet on its own surrounded by humans that talk to it while male parakeets tend to talk better than female parakeets do both can certainly talk birds learn best in the morning when their mind is fresh and ready for new information if you use a towel or cover over your bird's cage talk to them for hr before you remove it each morning repeat the same phrases loudly slowly and clearly parakeets do best with hard letters like k and t so the traditional hello is actually sort of hard for a parakeet cutie would be much better parakeets tend to mumble and to talk quickly so the more slowly you talk the more normal it will sound when the bird starts to repeat it have patience and eventually hopefully your parakeet will start to answer back to you once they get the hang of it they'll learn more and more quickly as you go it works best if you physically talk to your parakeet and that you do it often parakeets can also learn to mimic other sounds around them parakeets are capable of learning many many words phrases with dedication from the owner  Parrot Hearing impairment Conure Dog training B3ta Stuttering Shaggy dog story Music Kender Red-masked Parakeet Avenue Q Social rule Guinea pig Koan Blood on the Tracks Scientology beliefs and practices Japanese tea ceremony God Emperor of Dune Canary Marching band Carolina Parakeet Martial art Philosophy of language Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.

i want to bring my budgie parakeet out of it's cage to exercise but she is avoiding my hand ok so i've had this parakeet since fathers day the day after we got her we brought her in my bathroom to fly it was so hard to get her out and she nearly killed herself when she was out so we haven't taken her out since no way now today i try to take her out with the windows and mirrors covered and she won't come out she flies away from my hand and clings to the side of her cage i even left the door opened and she just stares i feel so bad for her because she just sits there all day and all we can do is talk to her and sing and read she also doesn't play with her toys we have a swing with a bell on it and a ladder w a mirror she doesn't even know how to sit on my finger because everytime i put my hand in the cage like i said she clings to the side until my hand is out of there my poor bird what can i do i feel so bad patience is the key most parakeets are shy when it comes to coming out or sitting on someone's hand most of our budgies don't come out of the cage although some do it is a matter of choice for them we started with one that we took in because he had a birth defect with the way one of his wings grew no one wanted him so we gave him a home we had a similar concern for him so we decided the best thing to do was to get him a friend that helped tremendously and they both started playing and enjoying life over time we have taken in more unwanted budgies and we now have of them in two large cages most play some enjoy sitting and talking and some will actually come out and visit the cockatiels at times so my suggestion is to do one of two things you could get her a friend which might help her like it did with ours if you don't want to do that just take time each day and sit and talk with her after a few days start putting you hand in the cage and talking to her don't try to get her just hold your hand in the cage little by little try to move a little closer when she seems to accept it being there this could take days or months but just work with her every day around the same time for around minutes each time once you are able to get near her she may eventually sit on your hand leave it in the cage for a while and slowly build up to removing her from the cage always use calm slow tones when you talk to her it will take time most likely but if you are patient she will eventually come around good luck  Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) Social rule John Cage Hamster Aerial (dance move) Blonde on Blonde Salad Fingers Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Budgerigar Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.

should i get a friend for my parakeet her mate is gone and she's never been an only bird before she's only years old but i have no idea about her mate's age though it was much older i don't know what happened to her mate so how long should i wait before getting a new mate for her to make sure she is still healthy if you really want to get her another friend them wait at least weeks and get her checked by a vet to ensure what killed the other bird is not contagious when you get a new bird do not just put it straight in the cage with your original one place it in a separate cage next to the other bird and give them time to get to know one another first once they have become accustomed to one another and you want to place them both in together you will need to reaarange the cage you are going to use so it is like a new one to both birds change the position of the perches and add different toys and place feed containers at different places this gives both birds the same level in the pecking order if you just put a new bird in to the old birds cage then the old bird is dominant over it and will act accordingly if the cage is new to both then it reduces the chance of one being overly bossy monitor their interaction closely for for the first few days to ensure they get along and neither harms the other i have used this method many times and it works extremely well  Hamster John Cage Chicken Poker jargon Ferret Guinea pig Mealy Parrot Airport Spider Canary Falconry Animal communication Wa shogi CPU cache Debugging Extinction Bird Dog Trapping Sea-Monkey RuneScape quests Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Professional wrestling match types Species Social rule Hall & Oates Dairy Theory of conduct Chess strategy and tactics Mixed martial arts Tai shogi Dai dai shogi Equine conformation Prostate cancer Mosquito Kakapo Betting (poker) Seabird Elections in the United States Chess terminology Housebreaking Breastfeeding Taikyoku shogi Consensus decision-making Diseases of the honeybee Biological pest control Champagne (beverage) Earthworm Royal Assent Tori shogi Shogi Lung Condom Electrophysiology Team Fortress Classic Yerba mate Influenza Judkins shogi Fox hunting Zone of the Enders: The Fist of Mars Carolina Parakeet Bird migration Chess opening Maka dai dai shogi Ivory-billed Woodpecker Jon Secada The Menagerie Kangaroo Gray Wolf Vitamin C Publication of Darwin's theory Humpback Whale Elections in the United Kingdom CPU design Garfield Sexual dimorphism The Emancipation of Mimi The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Cockfight Surveillance Fancy rat Tasmanian Devil Orca Remix Sesame Street The Incredibles Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004 Shotgun Billboard Hot 100 Magic (illusion) Albatross RuneScape weapons Domestic rabbit Boxing Microshogi Tenjiku shogi Shaggy dog story Budgerigar

four baby birds are outside on my porch and i believe that the mother has abandoned them what can i do to take care of them i feel sorry for them is there somebody i can call or is there a way for me to take care of them myself if the babies have most of their feathers they are fledglings baby birds fledge leave the nest several days before they can fly they need time to hop around on the ground climb low branches and exercise their wings until they have strengthened them enough for flight the parent birds continue to feed and care for the fledglings until they are self sufficient if they are fledglings leave them where you found them the parents are probably just gathering food for them leave the area because the parents think of you as a predator and will not come back to their babies if you are visible if they do not have many feathers yet and you think they are still nestlings try to find the nest and place the birds back in the nest do not worry that you have touched them birds do not have an acute sense of smell the parent birds will not detect your scent on the babies and will not reject them wildlife biologists and bird banders handle baby birds all the time with thier bare hands and the parents never reject the babies if you can not find the nest and place the birds back contact a licensed wildlife rehabilitator you can find one here http www tc umn edu devo contact htm please under no circumstances attempt to care for the baby birds yourself there is so much more to rehabilitation than keeping the animal alive until you think it is ready to be released you have to know not only what to feed the bird but how please do not attempt to give the bird any liquid by dropper baby birds can aspirate and die how much and how often you also have to know how to assess the birds general health and condition a baby bird kept in captivity must be taught to recognize and find the type of food it will eat in the wild if it is being hand fed it may not associate the bugs and berries and seeds in nature as being food it must also have the opportunity to exercise its wings a lot so it will be able to fly on or shortly after release when i volunteered at the avian rehabilitation center we kept the rehabilitating fledglings in a large walk in cage with lots of shelves and branches leading from one shelf to the other and down to the ground we would place different types of food in the cage for them as they were being weaned from the hand feeding formula we offered seed meal worms and chopped up fruit no fledgling was released until it was eating on its own had sufficient weight gain had all of its flight feathers in good condition had no sign of diarreah or nasal discharge had clear eyes and could fly at least a few feet in a straight line these are the reasons to get the bird to a licensed rehabilitator they have the training and the resources necessary to do all this in addition to having the permits to do it all legally all native migratory birds in the us are protected under the migratory bird treaty act and you must have the proper permits to have them even for a short time even for good reasons like saving them many other countries also have similar laws regarding their native species  Breastfeeding Kakapo Hamster Albatross Seabird Chicken Bird Falconry Capercaillie Pet skunk Bird migration Cat Hunting Peafowl Mealy Parrot Bird ringing Dinosaur Bat Condor Species Guinea pig Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Platypus Livestock 613 mitzvot H5N1 Acorn Extinction Terri Schiavo Ant Dog Ivory-billed Woodpecker Insulin Bird flight Hedgehog Airport Red Squirrel Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Fancy rat Mosquito Insect Dodo Comanche Gliding Foie gras Agriculture Gray Wolf Genetically modified food Ostrich Tetrapod Tasmanian Devil Vegetarianism Diabetes mellitus Fox hunting Orca Animal communication Trapping Peregrine Falcon Saruman RuneScape quests Animal testing Infantilism Hemp Rock Dove Weight training Archaeopteryx European Magpie Tyrannosaurus rex Trademark Nurse Shark Imprinting (psychology) Shrimp farm Peanut Domesticated turkey Insurance Honeybee Vermicompost Heinkel He 112 Canary Gas metal arc welding Egg (food) Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 Mid-levels Apple Prostate cancer Hummingbird Nile crocodile Pterosaur Animal rights Childbirth

can a bird and a rodent become friends i have a cockatiel and a few hamsters and i was wondering if i could introduce the the cockatiel puts her wings up when she's on their cage but is that just her being tough or is she saying come near me and i'll kill you what do you think depends on your birds temperament i personally would not introduce them i had a cockatiel with a mean attitude and i had no idea that a bite from such a small bird could hurt so much but if you do introduce them be careful that your hamsters eyes don't get ripped out they're very delicate creatures and it probably wouldn't be in your hamsters or birds best interest good luck  Hamster Cockatiel Pet Piccolo Junior Saga Social rule Bird Theory of conduct Animal testing Galaxy Angel Pet skunk Kim Possible Johnny Cage John Cage Doom enemies Chinchilla Ferret Characters of Megatokyo Bat The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Timon and Pumbaa Chicken Wood carving Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Cat Tenshinhan Kender The Shining (film) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Falconry Seabird Stoat Sub-Zero Monster Rancher monsters Alignment (role-playing games) Mid-levels W.I.T.C.H.

how does a pidgeon always find its way home no one knows exactly for sure how they do it there are a number of theories some have attributed it to the magnetic feilds of the earth their sense of smell and even a ridiculous theory called eyesign that looks tiny specks in pigeons eyes however pigeons do have remarkable senses and certainly for sure use landmark recognition to help them on their way home as they always use the same route home they have a stong drive to return home to nest and mate and a place with food and water homing pigeons have also been selectively bred since hundreds of years ago for those with the strongest homing instinct which also plays a role in pigeons finding their way home  Bird Homing pigeon Rock Dove Pink Pigeon Dog Seabird Peregrine Falcon Ant Passenger Pigeon Dove Salmon Solar variation Hamster Auk Discus (fish) Bird migration Animal communication Kakapo Pigeon racing Species Platypus Rock, Paper, Scissors Combine (Half-Life 2) Trilobite Shark Sense Darwin from Orchids to Variation Pigeon Guillemot Vitamin C Wood Pigeon Tasmanian Devil Penguin Albatross Superstition Development of Darwin's theory The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Minor Harry Potter Beasts Artificial selection Life in the Freezer Cat Dinosaur Honeybee Extinction Band-tailed Pigeon Snowball Earth Hypnosis James Hutton Skeet shooting Gilligan's Island Magnetic core memory Inception of Darwin's theory Sociobiology Plate tectonics Philosophy of language Evolution Plant breeding Bottlenose Dolphin Climate change Saturn German Shepherd Dog Dodo Horse North Avatar: The Last Airbender Animal cognition Brain Reaction to Darwin's theory House Sparrow House Mouse American lobster Ley line Hummingbird USS Seadragon (SS-194) Pigeonhole principle Holocene extinction event Tag Earth's magnetic field Characters of Naruto Border Collie Stock Dove Vulcan (Star Trek) Ostrich Insect Surtsey Rathfarnham Gal__pagos Islands Gaia theory (science) Geomagnetic reversal Felis sapiens Behaviorism Max Stirner Magnet Coconut crab Richard Owen Beetle Kereru Tank Pigeon intelligence Patriotism Domestication

any tips for taming a parakeet don't just put your hand in the cage this doesn't do anything and sometimes makes taming harder because the bird doesn't think that you're nice they think that you just invade their space for a few minutes each day the real way to tame a bird is to get them to trust you feed him treats through the cage bars and once he eats the treats from your fingers easily put your hand in the cage and feed him the treats once he easily does that put one finger above his feet and hold the treat far away so that he has to jump on your finger to get the treat after a few days he'll just jump on your finger because he wants his treat and you have a tamed bird also check out http www cockatootrainer com timidness  Hamster Salad Fingers Guinea pig Volleyball Domain Name System Violin Skateboarding trick Mixed martial arts Aerial (dance move) Chicken Falconry Professional wrestling match types Diving Equine conformation Archery Canary Domestic rabbit RuneScape quests Chess strategy and tactics John Cage Non-native pronunciations of English Elephant Electrophysiology Chopsticks Professional wrestling holds HyperText Transfer Protocol Hansel und Gretel Carolina Parakeet Fancy rat Theory of conduct Gesture Double bass Bat Fecal incontinence Horizontal bar Creatures in Bionicle Magic (illusion) Little Britain Plum-headed Parakeet Dualism (philosophy of mind) Boxing Kitesurfing Champagne (beverage) Dog training Hannibal Lecter Blue-footed Booby Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Betting (poker) Trapping Newton's Parakeet Mealy Parrot Freddy Got Fingered Time Out of Mind The Inside Slashdot subculture English longbow The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Surveillance Jackass: The Movie The finger Piccolo Junior Saga Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) StarCraft Episode VI Dairy Textile manufacturing Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics Wall Street Copyleft In The Groove (game) Cape Feare Sewing machine The Birds (film) Vector (spatial) Little Shop of Horrors XML Stomach cancer On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Humphrey Bogart Triage Three Stooges Prostate cancer Sundial Texas hold 'em Invader Zim Hazing Knife Russian joke XRI Experiment Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Astro Boy Table tennis Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Swingout Gal__pagos Islands Bassoon Mutual fund Tip Scuba set

how do i cut my budgies nails ive had him for weeks and his nails are long how do i cut them i would suggest buying a budgie book that will show you illustrations on how to cut your birds nails basically you just want to trim off a bit of the hook on the nail making sure you don't cut the quick or the blood vessel in the nail i use regular nail clippers because i find i have alot more control with them i also have someone else hold the bird they squirm alot and you don't want to cut their toes you can use styptic powder or corn starch to stop bleeding in case you do cut too far it would be a great idea to have a vet or an experienced bird owner show you how it is done from the books that i have read you do not want to use those sandpaper perches these can cause their feet to become raw and they don't work anyhow before i knew any better i had tried them good luck  Nail (anatomy) Callus Woodworking Budgerigar Horseshoe Los Angeles Clippers Equine conformation Shaving Pottery Milton H.

can someone help i started raising turkeys this year they do well up to wks and then start dying off they are getting something from the ground mainly when it rains their pens are covered from the rain but water stills runs thru pens i am now putting down plenty of pine shavings to help with sanitary concerns i just don't have any way to keep off the ground when they get over wks old getting something from when it rains sounds like botulism or salmonella they'll spend a day or more looking drunk and then die until you actually remove the organism the problem will keep popping up take all the animals out of the pens while you use some stall cleaner to clean up their area a concrete floor will cut way down on the problem and is easy to install just get some quick crete and pour it on the floor of the pens then smooth it with a flat shovel nothing perfect just something to separate your birds from the water coming in with or without the quick crete floors you can put down some wood ash from a fire place or bonfire pit or you can just buy the all natural wood coal five bucks a bag and crush it up pour this evenly over the floors and it'll help neutralize the droppings which the organisms feed on never use stall cleaner on a dirt floor if you've just got a dirt floor and you can't put in concrete then use a mix of one half cup bleach with a gallon of water and soak the area this will cut down on bacteria build up it takes months to clear up a bad infection and while you wait you may want to get the terramycin poultry powder for your birds follow the directions closely i personally use the terramycin livestock pills as they are extra strength and can be cut up in a pill cutter for correct dosing where as you can't accurately dose water where multiple birds will be drinking i don't raise turkeys i raise ducks but ducks go through the exact same thing we had a bout of salmonella early this spring due to some heavy rains and dirt floors we've been putting in concrete floors over the summer  Mattress Dairy Wood Menstrual cup Basement Drill bit Tattoo Concrete Biological warfare Textile manufacturing Thermal power station Livestock Sewage treatment Coffee Domesticated turkey Casting Fossil fuel power plant H5N1 Japanese toilet Social rule Seismic retrofit Kitchen Skateboarding trick Barbecue Poker jargon Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Professional wrestling match types Tofu Brewery Diseases of the honeybee Guinea pig Marine aquarium Apollo 8 Campfire Gramophone record Gypsy moth GunZ The Duel Coal Fancy rat Chopsticks Vacuum cleaner Fire fighting Egg (food) Tooth enamel Trench warfare Fecal incontinence M16 (rifle) Violin Fast bowling Carburetor Baptism Soap Atlanta metropolitan area Indianapolis 500 Hemp RuneScape quests Illegal drug trade Idli Sento Japanese tea ceremony Tobacco Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Time Out of Mind Logging Psoriasis Escherichia coli O157:H7 Ionizing radiation Diarrhea Nuclear fallout Domestic rabbit Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Diving Upholstery Factory farming Vinegar Autonomous building Urinary incontinence Fire extinguisher Tea Water purification Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Pottery Water Battle of Kursk Pok__mon Abilities Fountain Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Second Battle of the Atlantic Shotgun West Side Highway

some ways to make ur congo african grey parrot trust you time and patience are the requirements for gaining a bird's trust especially if it has been abused start out by not forcing physical contact on the bird just go in and spend to hours a day talking to the bird in a soothing voice after a time you should see a change in the birds attitude as it accepts you more next start handfeeding it special treats through the bars if it refuses treats that you know the bird is fond of then take them away under no circumstances are you to give the bird the treat unless he takes it from your hand he muct come to associate socializing with the treats after he begins to eat from your hand you can then open the cage and offer him the treats at the door of his cage let the bird come to you if he refuses the treats then close the door and take the treats away do not return for at least several hours eventually he will trust you enough to come to the front of the cage to take the treats next try giving the treat and then slowly and gently stroking his tummy or chest if he objects don't push the issue but try it again every time he gets fed his treats eventually he will come to accept your touch after he accepts your touch then try feeding him his treat after which you present your finger for hin to climb onto say step up and present your finger if hee seems friendly but does not catch on quickly then try presneting you finger and pushing gently on his legs or tummy in an effort to encourage him to step up when he willingly steps up you may remove him form the cage it will show him that you are in charge if you make him do a few repetitions of step up from one hand to the other this program can take weeks months or even years if a bird has been badly mistreated the key is patience nad more patience expect to get nipped from time to time when this happenns you can say sternly no bite and close the cage and walk away after he has begun to do step up you can usually correct any misbehavior by making him do a few repetions of step up good luck with your training  Breastfeeding Mixed martial arts Aerial (dance move) Social rule Dog training Hamster Fancy rat Salad Fingers Trapping RuneScape quests Domestic rabbit Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Software engineering Stuttering Falconry Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Volleyball Weight training Pet skunk Professional wrestling holds Diving Gliding Customs and etiquette of Japan Kakapo Swingout Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Boxing Guinea pig Japanese tea ceremony Equine conformation Tai Chi Chuan Saruman Ferret Table tennis Mealy Parrot Butterfly stroke Eddie Guerrero Garfield Continuation War Care Bears Archery Baseball Chess terminology Scientology beliefs and practices Fecal incontinence Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Balboa (dance) Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Escape from New York The Birds (film) The Empty Child Salute Ismaili English grammar Breaststroke Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Glossary of climbing terms Father's Day (Doctor Who) Shaggy dog story Alcoholics Anonymous Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Clinical depression Rosa Parks Mao (game) Textile manufacturing The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Combine (Half-Life 2) Second Battle of the Atlantic Reservoir Dogs First aid The Shining (film) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Jean Grey Magic (illusion) Alcoholism Plame affair Piccolo Junior Saga Anorexia nervosa United Kingdom corporation tax Tai shogi National Kidney Foundation Singapore Polyamory M16 (rifle) Elephant Skateboarding trick Professional wrestling match types Front crawl Property (ownership right) Catwoman Late Night with Conan O'Brien Scouting Heinkel He 112 Cyprus dispute

please help parakeet problem okay i have a parakeet and he used to fly be active and chatter alot with the others now just yesterday i noticed that when he flew to the top of the curtain he didn't land like he used to he would land halfway then climb up today i was trying to help him fly but he would fly but then he would go down and couldn't get back up on his cage and his wings are long does anybody know what might be wrong please help i'm sorry if i don't really make sense i tried my best but with the worries that something my be wrong really stresses me out please help me i don't want to loose my buddy if you can help please e mail me at j tweetyeyes yahoo com to answer the few questions ya'll might have i let him and the other ones fly in my room all day until its their bedtime wich is and i leave their cage open so they can eat drink and play they have enough room to fly around and they seem to enjoy it his wings were clipped but he was still able to fly good when i am there he doesn't hit anything but i still spend time with them and play with them so i am thinking that either like ya'll said he could have hurted himself or maybe its cuz he's too chunky and the weight is weighing him down what do ya'll think well if his wings are clipped they weren't clipped properly if he's good at flying with clipped wings he needs them shorter also if his feathers are starting to grow a little he may be lopsided which will cause him to fly funny as much as you like them flying around it really isn't safe even when the bird is good at flying there are thousands of dangers in a house that you may not realize i've always kept my birds well clipped except for one cockatoo but that was a different story because even though they wont fly away and don't hit things while flying it's still unsafe if he's chubby he needs a new diet is he on a seed based diet if he is switch him to a pellet kaytee exact rainbow pellets are my favorite diet or at least the kaytee fiesta food because it has seeds fruit nuts veggies and pellets in it when a bird gets fat especially when it can fly something is very wrong with the diet if you need more help figuring out what to do with his food please feel free to email me at cockatoorescuetrainer gmail com or through my website http www cockatootrainer com contact  Piccolo Junior Saga Guinea pig Chicken Shaggy dog story Fancy rat Hamster Parrot Domestic rabbit Gmail The Ashlee Simpson Show Vegetarianism Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Jon Secada Social rule Homer Simpson Matt Hardy Equine conformation Seabird Fecal incontinence GunZ The Duel Dieting Gliding 2000 Australian Grand Prix Heinkel He 100 Heinkel He 112 Friends Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) Ferret Veganism Humphrey Bogart Anorexia nervosa Procrastination Glossary of climbing terms RuneScape quests I Want to Hold Your Hand Bubble Bobble Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cliff Richard Kodocha Big Brother (USA TV series) Time Out of Mind Opera (web browser) Acorn Carpenters Little Britain Cuisine of Malaysia Philosophical skepticism Trapping Bird Ron and Fez AFI 100 Years series The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Beatles The Shining (film) The Star Wars Holiday Special Bird migration Falconry Eddie Guerrero Google Shotgun Bon Jovi Good Morning, Vietnam One Tree Hill (TV series) Tenshinhan Raw food diet Ron Weasley Russian joke Danger Hiptop Singlish Rain Man Volleyball EastEnders Jackass: The Movie Spidey Super Stories Hip hop rivalries Poker jargon Transactional analysis Blood (computer game) W.I.T.C.H.

sulphur crested cockatoo biting my boyfriend recently bought home a sulphur crested cockatoo from a rescue sanctuary he had visited the bird on several occasions and built up a great relationship with it on our first meeting the bird though initially wary would 'step up' and take food until after about mins and for no apparent reason he bit my hand very hard since then the cockatoo has been very aggressive when i am alone with him reaching through the bars of the cage to grab me if i get too close hard to get to food and water bowls without injury and biting me when i try to encourage him to come out of the cage and onto his stand i don't want to leave him in the cage all day so wear or layers to protect my arms for the beak he also shakes as tho scared and clicks at me which i heed as a 'back off' warning he's so gentle with my boyfriend and i really want our bird to feel safe and protected and not lash out at me or others any suggestions as to how i can improve our relationship so today my bf left the bird alone on its stand and i kept my distance but still talked soothingly to him result he got curious flew to the floor walked up to me and put his beak on the floor and let me tickle the back of his neck for mins he did try to nip after that and was put back on his stand later at normal training time my bf suggested that i try to train him so i had him walking from one side of his stand to the other at my command but no luck with step up all of a sudden he flew at my head scratching my face and biting the back of my head very hard no serious injuries just shock and a few scratches and bruises my bf witnessed this and confirmed that the bird is attacking me not just trying to land i know it's a slow process gaining his trust but i can't understand why he was so uncharacteristically loving towards me but became so vicious when i was rewarding him is a good relationship with our bird totally unattainable for me he bird has bonded with your boyfriend and is trying to warn you away from his or her human the only remedy is lots of patience and work if you guys are really serious about having this bird fully accept you then your boyfriend need to stop spending time with the bird you must become the caregiver spend at least to hours a day speaking soothingly to the bird do not try to get it to step up or do anything special until it stops its aggressive behavior this can take weeks or even months after aggression stops then start offering special treats to it through the bars if the bird refuses them take the treat away you must show that aggression no treats eventually the bird should calm down and accept treat then you can try offering treats through the open door let the bird come to you again this will take time when the bird calmly accepts the treats you can try stroking its belly or chest a little when he gets used to this you can present your finger and say step up he will get the idea expect to get nipped a few times during training when that happens just say no bite close the cage and leave for at least several hours to show that this action was not acceptible the most important thing to remember is that this is a rescue bird which means it may have been abused sometimes if a bird is abused for instance by a woman the bird becomes hostile to all women this makes acceptance difficult but not impossible rescues take a lot more time and patience than gently handled birds but the reward's can be great good luck  Aerial (dance move) RuneScape quests Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Diving Social

a few budgie parakeet questions i just got these birds yesterday and i am new to birdkeeping mine have tiny black dots near the middle of their feathers are they mites how to get rid they preen themselves and each other and seem to pick out dry skin is this normal sickness they are scared of anyone who opens the cage but i have managed to feed the male food from my hand i don't know how old they are but what is the best way to tame them thank you budgies are friendly fellas and they can be taught to fly around the room sit on your shoulder and take food from your hand the males are very clever at learning to talk but it takes time the tiny black dots sounds odd maybe get a vet to check them out yes the preening is quite normal behaviour as for training it takes patience and persistence frequently talking to your budgie using a soft voice to sooth them each training session should last between minutes slowly put your hand in the cage and keep it in there until the bird has a chance to settle itself down resist the urge to grab or move your hand over to the budgie in the first few sessions give him some time to come used to the presence of your hand when he stops freaking out at the sight of your hand in the cage it is time to slowly push your finger towards his belly like a perch say up when you press your finger against his belly when you return him to his cage or perch say down continue talking to the budgie when he is on your finger when it seems like he is comfortable sitting on your finger you may slowly take him out of the cage on your finger do not be over zealous the first time you take him out of the cage always keep these training sessions short at first eventually the time out of the cage will increase and you will have a trusting budgie friend don't try to handle them in the first few days in their new home give him some time to get used to his new home and environment have the cage in a room where you are alot of the time spend lots of time with him talking to him and putting your hands in the cage only to change their water and give them fresh food make a point to show them that you are merely doing good things for him and not trying to hurt him it may take some time before he will decide to come out to you and you may try to bribe him to come out of his cage by leaving some budgie treats right outside the cage door or even in your hand right inside or outside the cage eventually he will learn to accept you and be your friend enjoy your new birds  Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hamster Milton H.

how can i tell if my three parakeets are happy and healthy i don't know if my parakeets are healthy because i don't feed them fruits and veggies i do put fruits and veggies in their cage but they never eat it they stay away from it like it is a monster who will kill them i've tried apples celery banana cabbage and brocolli but when i give them their seed diet in their food cup with vitamins they only eat millet and i don't give it as a treat it is in their seed diet i don't really know if my parakeets are happy but they always chirp out loud very loud you can hear them houses away from ours kind of active because they always stay in spot cleaning themselves and i spray them with mist times a week in the summer and i only got them this they only play with three toys wich are balls swing and a mini ferris wheel toy that's all they ever play with are they healthy and happy enough for them to live long budgies i am assuming that is what you are calling a parakeet there are many different kinds of parakeets have a life expectancy of years most of those that die young are either unhealthy or develop a tumor this tumor tends to be a not so uncommon occurrence it tends to show up just before or during the th th year diet of just seed is also pretty common amongst budgie owners for the best health a diet of pellet is better and even that should be mixed with seed and fresh veggies and fruit the way i get budgies on a pellet diet because most budgies when purchased are on seed is i give seed with a small amount of pellets and every weeks i increase the pellet and decrease the seed another thing about budgies if you have paid attention when you change out their food they tend to eat only the food on the top surface the fresh foods should be finely chopped from what i read they appear to be healthy also it is not unusual for them to have a preference on the toys they play with have yet to see one that does not like bells  Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Fancy rat Vegetarianism Prostate cancer Budgerigar Dietary fiber Healthy eating Bread Mealy Parrot Atkins Nutritional Approach Stomach cancer Diarrhea Hamburger Colorectal cancer Jewish cuisine Folic acid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fruit Organic food Shotgun Tooth Milk Vitamin C Ramen Tomato Chicken Vegetarianism and religion Sea-Monkey Fecal incontinence Dieting Breastfeeding Nutrition Muesli Tocopherol Genetically modified food Blood (computer game) Acne German cuisine Canary Happy Meal Famine Pet skunk Organic farming Potassium Cuisine of Denmark Rice Garlic Anorexia nervosa Cancer Bengali cuisine Chinchilla Fruitarianism Cuisine of Brazil Super Size Me Tofu Cuisine of the Southern United States Banana Miso Urinary incontinence Garfield Food guide pyramid Fugu Hypoglycemia Polish cuisine Health insurance Ferret Sauerkraut Flowering plant Tlingit Hemp Cuisine of Malaysia Farthing (coin) Biological pest control Potato Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Human height Japanese tea ceremony Low-carbohydrate diet Poker jargon Irish cuisine Raw food diet Chile pepper Food preservation Vitamin Maize Chronic fatigue syndrome

nervous cockatiel i have two cockatiels on gray which i s months old i got him wks ago and and a month lutino cockatiel i got a week ago every since i put them outside in different cages the lutino is always running around and flapping its wings in the cage like its trying to get out and my gray is chirping at it and i guess trying to talk i don't know what sex my lutino is because its too young but what should i do im trying to get them tamest birds out of them if i put them together in a cage will it be harder or will it be the same thing any tips on taming my birds every time i get my gray cockatiel it flies from my finger and hurts himself and he just recently recoverd from wing damage and i don't want anything to happen to it any hints firstly you have to give them time to get used to their new surroundings that means just leaving them alone for anywhere from several days to several weeks it sounds like you might be rushing things a bit by trying to train them before they are comfortable in their new home by trying to interact with them too soon you may be scaring them for now just leave them alone except for feeding waterring and cage cleaning go in once or twice a day and spend some time gently talking to them in a soiothing voice so that they see you are not going to harm them after they get calmed down and used to your presence then start giving them treats through the bars if they don't take the treat from your hand then take the treat away you want them to see that you are the only source of treats once they are readily accepting treats try opening the cage and offerring treats let the bird come to you don't force your hand into the cage when they finally accept treats with open cage door then you can present your finger saying step up after awhile the bird will step up on command patience is the key bird training takes alot of time one question why did you put your cages outside the outside environment changes with weather time of day traffoc noises and even wild birds taking the cages inside will provide a more stable environment and help the birds to calm down who knows you might even have a hawk crow blue jay or other bird flying around outside which your bird is terrified at seeing  Hamster Social rule Salad Fingers Falconry John Cage Dog training RuneScape quests Cockatiel Mealy Parrot Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an G-Man (Half-Life) Ferret The Birds (film) Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Milton H.

how do i stop my quail from laying eggs hi i have a female button chinese pained quail who is laying an egg almost every day since this will dramatically shorten her life span i'd like to get her to lay the fewest number of eggs possible i've read that reducing their light to hours per day should reduce the number of eggs produced but this doesn't appear to be working does anyone have any other ideas i haven't removed any of her eggs she has of them scattered in groups around her cage dancing leaf many sites about quails say males live about years and females live about years because of the strain on their bodies loss of calcium and protein from producing all those eggs it is quite typical of chinese painted 'button' quail to lay their eggs all over the place there is not much you can do as far as i am aware if she is sitting on the eggs which they may sometimes decide to do regardless of whether there is a male or not then you can put fake eggs in the nest to stop the laying they can lay on sit on as many as eggs at one time i've had it happen i'm not sure if putting fake eggs in will stop their 'egg scattering' though just make sure she is getting plenty of calcium things like broccoli cuttlefish bone grated onto their food parsley beet greens yams and spinach are good sources of calcium you could even cook and feed the eggs back to her as well as the eggshell but it must be baked first it is true that males live around years and females around months largely due to all the eggs they lay however i've had a female live for years and she was laying heaps of eggs all her life and raised quite a few children  Chicken Tofu Egg (food) Guinea pig Sugar beet Japanese cuisine Sushi Dietary fiber Carbon dioxide Platypus Domestic rabbit Spider Cuisine of Denmark Cuisine of the Philippines Veganism Vegetarianism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Leatherback Sea Turtle Cuisine of Malaysia Kakapo Anopheles Bird Ostrich Aphid Theory of conduct Jewish cuisine Milk Bobwhite Quail Ice cream Drosophila melanogaster Vitamin C Kidney stone Black widow spider Food Kodocha Potato John Cage Tarantula Human skin color Sonic the Hedgehog Emu Octopus Protein German cuisine Professional wrestling holds Eggshell Gypsy moth Cantonese cuisine Hamburger Factory farming Organic food Equine conformation Dairy Cuisine of Singapore Ocean's Twelve Weight training Insulin Spinach Soy milk Vegetarian nutrition Iron Shark Atkins Nutritional Approach Tilapia American lobster Rickets Kiwi Pizza Common bean Vegetarian cuisine Seabird Vitamin D Peruvian cuisine Albatross Breastfeeding Dumpling Piccolo Junior Saga Pysanka Bengali cuisine Diseases of the honeybee Multiple myeloma Cauliflower Capercaillie Sex Parthenogenesis Mosquito Rice pudding Protein-energy malnutrition Grasshopper Paget's disease of bone Egg (biology) Cuisine of Brazil Salad Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Mattress

how do i stop my senegal parrot from shrieking i took her to a boarder with other birds and she came home with a shriek that drives me crazy i try to ignore it but she feels that i dont like it and she knows i am paying attention so she keeps doing it i have tried ignoring it and i have tried to tell her no when she does it neither seems to work how long has it been since she came home she's either just showing you that she's angry with you for leaving her or you didn't ignore her for long enough it takes a few days and you have to actively ignore birds do not cover the cage this doesn't show them that they're in trouble it just makes them think you're mean for putting them to bed early when she screams leave the room shut off the lights and don't come back until she's been silent for a full minutes it can take a while then come back and give her lots of attention and treats the screaming should go away or at least greatly decrease in a couple days if after this you're still having trouble please feel free to let me know i work a lot with cockatoos who are real screaming birds so i know lots of tricks  Shaggy dog story Real Love (song) Eddie Guerrero Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ron Weasley The Shining (film) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Equine conformation Pok__mon Live!

what should i look for if i add a female cockatoo to my home with a male african grey currently i own a male timneh african grey he is attatched to my fiance and typically isn't interested in me for more than the occassional kiss so i'm concidering adding a second bird to the home and have a love for the triton sulfur crested cockatoos i don't really have a preference for either male or female but i don't know how the male timneh would react to different sexes i know with dogs its best to add a female to a home with a male dogs simply for the alpha dominance stuff but i'm not certain with birds the timneh is years old and somewhat skiddish but seems to tolerate birds okay outside of the home if i were to bring a female in would he lean towards her as a mate even if she's a different species i owned a male parakeet and a female cockatiel once and he chose her as a mate and became aggressive towards the rest of us or would he be more likely to be aggressive towards another male brought into the house i'm looking to get a hand raised baby first thing to consider is the fact that most greys not raised with other species of birds don't like the different species of course each bird within a species is his or her own persoanality too my congo grey doesn't like my umbrella cockatoo's in part i suspect because they are much larger and more active than are greys even threating to the greys when wings are spread open and flapping the tag timneh will not be attracted sexually to the triton however male birds during hormonal times do become very agressive so with that said and my years of experience living with and learning about a varity of avain species i suggest you get a female they are sweeter too the only way to sex a bird is either surgery not done often any more or dna which can be done by collecting a drop of blood from the nail during nail trims and sending to labs that do this for which i have but can't find right now duh do a google or yahoo search for labs that do dna sexing for avain species not are are created equel or have an avian vet or the breeder do it for you  Bird Sexual attraction Sex Dog Hamster Gray Wolf Ferret Cockatiel Sexual selection Sexual dimorphism Elephant Ostrich Prostate cancer Gay slang Kakapo Platypus Cockatoo Sexual reproduction Estrus cycle Mountain Gorilla Jurassic Park Guinea pig Non-human animal sexuality Brain Puberty Orgasm Baldness Zoophilia Androgen insensitivity syndrome Animal communication Kim Possible Spider Transsexuality Jean-Luc Picard Human sexual behavior Sexual differentiation DNA Dinosaur Transgender Chicken Parrot Intersexuality Pet Infantilism Heteronormativity Sexual orientation Nile crocodile Peafowl Pet skunk The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Artificial selection Biology and sexual orientation Cat Mosquito Sex assignment Sexual intercourse Gender Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Irreducible complexity Vulcan (Star Trek) The Invisibles Poker jargon Penis Humphrey Bogart Breast H5N1 Lion Sadism and masochism Hermaphrodite Dragons (Pern) Baboon Parthenogenesis Asexuality Dilbert Pedophilia Avian influenza Tarantula Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Condor Red Phalarope Tuatara Gender identity Resident Evil: Apocalypse Rape Giant Panda Sexual identity Gerald Durrell Bondage (BDSM) Bottlenose Dolphin Borg

what is best food for parakeet do they like seeds only or can they eat bread and stuff we eat once in awhile well bird food isn't formulated as regularly as dog and cat food right now the best bird food on the market are the bird pellets they have a uniform look and have all the vitamins and mineral a bird needs though they've noted some birds still have a vitamin a deficiency while on them so they can be fed things like potatoes sweet potatoes etc the downside of these pellets is that they aren't visually appealing to most birds and they don't want to eat them birds on normal birdseed eat favorites so they don't always get all the vitamins and minerals that way either mixing pellets and seeds doesn't always work because most birds will just pick out their favorites some birds will empty the whole food container just to get to that favorite seed on the bottom as for human food you have to be careful some birds will decide they like that better than their food and only eat that once they've been spoiled generally it's best to just let them stick to their own food unless they have a vitamin or mineral deficiency also remember to keep a gnawing stone bone in the cage for a parakeet the white things that attatch to the side of the cage those provide minerals as well as keeping the bird's beak trim  Hamster Chicken Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Potato Vitamin C Food Vitamin Nutrition Egg (food) Bread Veganism Genetically modified food Bird Acorn Retinol Cat Fancy rat Vitamin D Canary Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Vitamin K Fecal incontinence Tocopherol RuneScape quests Vegetarian nutrition Vegetarianism Potato chips Anorexia nervosa Milk Tooth enamel German cuisine Tooth Pet skunk Coeliac disease Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Coprophagia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Garfield Folic acid Sweet potato Soul food Omega-3 fatty acid Domesticated turkey Hot dog Soybean Blood (computer game) Chile pepper Livestock Tomato Shaggy dog story Korean cuisine Insulin 613 mitzvot Cyanocobalamin Niacin Cuisine of Denmark Dietary fiber Kakapo Rose Zinc Date Palm Carnivore Anemia Fruitarianism Malnutrition Ramen Foie gras Golden rice Tlingit Organic food Jewish cuisine The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Pine Breakfast Dog food Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Pizza Parrot Irish cuisine Ferret Antioxidant Theory of conduct Japanese cuisine Maize RuneScape economy Human skin color Dodo Capercaillie Raw food diet Cuisine of the Philippines Tofu Stomach cancer Shampoo Shotgun John Cage Food preservation

should i give my cockatiel away or buy her a friend the only thing my cockatiel wants to do is spend time with me or my husband i can't interest her in anything else after years of trying and tons of money spent on toys if she's not with us she screams sometimes unrelentingly for hours on end i've tried the whole ignoring her so she won't scream business she requires constant attention otherwise she gets peculiar and i'm worried she may be getting depressed i am about to have my first baby my husband will be working full time and we do not have the time to spend with her i can't give her all the time she needs i am not sure how many hours a day a solitary cockatiel needs from its owners but from my research it seems they need a very significant proportion of the day which i do not have i realize now i am not a bird person nor is my husband i will soon have much less time with baby on the way would it be better to find her a new owner who could give her the constant attention she requires or to get her a buddy granted i've discovered over the years that a bird was not the best choice for me as a pet but that does not mean i do not love her or that i have not cared for her she has lots of toys which i change out regularly a very large cage i give her a varied diet fresh veggies daily and high quality food even though i've had to make cut backs for myself to feed her the best food i can get and we do spend time with her talking to her petting her she loves head scratches playing with her she is very very affectionate i was only worried we don't spend enough time with her and that with baby on the way and jobs we'll have less time for her in the future i worried she might be depressed b c of her lack of interest in toys and flying though her interest with being with of us is very strong i'd like though if she could enjoy herself while we are away and she's in her cage i hate to think of her being miserable or sad thanks for the advice i did spend a lot of time with her in the beginning she wouldn't touch her food unless i held her she was never scared of me from the start but of everything else and it took a bit more time but she soon grew to adore hubby i think he's now her favorite but i've had her a while now and since those days of the initial spoiling its been at least three years and she is still very demanding i've tried the ignore tactics as you've described been working on them for a very long time now and i've tried radio all types of music and of course toys i don't have a tv i gave that up to make sure she got the best food she even calls while she's eating munch munch whamp munch munch whamp i unfortunately don't know anyone who doesn't have full time employment i think for someone with a lot of time she'd be excellent b c she's very sweet and loving though unimaginably stubborn i've had this happen with some birds in my shelter they were spoiled as soon as they were brought home the owner plays with the bird for hours and hours at first because it's new now the bird expects this every day have you tried entertaining her with the tv lots of birds love tv and actually start having a favorite show this way she can have the entertainment she wants and you don't have to worry about her being depressed the other thing is when the baby comes the bird will get jealous usually and you have to talk to her play with her and soon she'll just accept not being played with because of the new baby if she's screaming to be with you really the ignoring works it does take time especially with spoiled birds but it also depends upon the method you used for ignoring you kind of have to actively ignore birds when she screams shut off the lights no covering the cage they don't understand this and leave the room don't come back until the bird has been quiet for full minutes at first it may take hours but it will happen and once it does you're on your way to a quiet bird also once she realizes that she isn't going to be played with all the time she'll start wanting toys if you're sure that she's not going to work out with your family no you're not a horrible owner this is actually a very responsible thing to do and proves that you're a good owner because you want what's best for the bird just try to find a friend who wants her or contact an avian shelter sometimes they'll give you a list of names of people who want a cockatiel so the bird never has to go to the shelter it can go right from your home to the next home  Kodocha Shaggy dog story Knots Landing Hamster Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Garfield EastEnders Chicken Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jon Secada Characters in the Smurfs Piccolo Junior Saga Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) One Tree Hill (TV series) Domestic rabbit Humphrey Bogart RuneScape quests Breastfeeding Pitaten Time Out of Mind Friends Bird Theory of conduct Little Britain Cockatiel Avenue Q Infantilism Guinea pig John Cage Sin City Ferret Bread W.

why do the magpies near my house start singing at am i live in adelaide south australia there are big trees in the block over my back fence and the magpies start singing at about am why is that they're not squawking as though they're frightened of something they warble like they do at dawn any bird lovers know i have no idea why they do it our maggies do it here too it's a little annoying after a while i thought of one thing though it's usually sometime through a breeding season that this happens so maybe the youngsters in the nests are learning to vocalize just don't know the time of night it is because they're close to a street light  Australian Magpie Capercaillie Species Magpie Goose European Magpie Port Adelaide Notts County F.C.

watery bird poop i have a conure parrot that has been consistently having watery poops for about two weeks he has been to the vet who did a full panel on his fecal matter nothing was found out of the ordinary everywhere i read i see this is bad i have only had him for two months and he was sick when i got him with some bacterial infection his poop was watery then it wasn't watery again until a few weeks ago any ideas what makes a dropping droppings actually consist of three recognizable parts feces clear urine and a white urine called urates you'll want to get a good idea of what each part looks like normally for your bird and monitor all three daily so you can report any serious changes to your vet generally the feces part of the dropping should be green or brown it should be solid and coiled like a snake segmented or in pieces the urine portion of the stool should be clear and watery urates should be an opaque white beige crystalline material sometimes the urine and urates are mixed creating a cloudy looking material but usually they are separate not all changes in droppings indicate a health problem for instance different types of food can change the color of your bird's poop birds that favor pellets of a certain color may release feces that have taken on the same tinge the feces of birds who eat ordinary pellets are usually rust colored strawberries may introduce a slight reddish color and blueberries cherries and cranberries can turn fecal matter black watery foods can make your bird's droppings appear looser than usual sometimes droppings may even be all liquid however as long as any fecal matter remains solid watery droppings are not diarrhea they are perfectly normal instances of polyuria an increase in urine in fact long time bird owners who feed a healthy varied diet including not only pellets but moist foods such as fresh vegetables fruits beans pastas and cooked grains know that extra wet droppings are the norm they mean the bird is well hydrated you can expect to see an increase in urine also if your bird receives a scare or experiences stress such as during a veterinary exam for more information go to http www parrotchronicles com septoct droppings htm  Guinea pig Feces Fecal incontinence Vitamin C Coprophagia Fancy rat Prostate cancer Water Urinary incontinence Cat Nutrition Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Gout Escherichia coli O157:H7 Tofu Breastfeeding Chocolate Dog Food Folic acid Foodborne illness Pet skunk Glass Color Dairy Diseases of the honeybee Schistosomiasis Bulk vending Phase (matter) Plastic Iron Vegetarianism Egg (food) Food preservation Shotgun Crohn's disease Dietary fiber Capercaillie Flowering plant Common bean Atkins Nutritional Approach Opportunity rover Healthy eating Casting Tooth enamel Cuisine of Denmark Cheese Renewable energy Liquid crystal Adjustable gastric band Raw food diet HIV test Insulin Escherichia coli Alcohol fuel Cantonese cuisine Mealy Parrot Ferret Urine Colorectal cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Bread Constipation Wood Organic food Tomato Rotavirus Solar cell Fruit Cocaine Rice Domesticated turkey Vacuum Wood carving Pysanka Breakfast Pneumonia Species Maize Coffee Kakapo Coeliac disease Anemia House Mouse Thermoregulation Watermelon Irritable bowel syndrome Vinegar

anyone have any homemade parakeet toy ideas it depends on what kind of toys you are looking for it could be as simple as one or two jingle bells hanging from a rope or chain or as complicated as a play gym made from branches or dowels to allow the bird to exercise you can even make simple treat toys by taking chipped fruits and veggies fresh or dried or other favorite small treats roll them up inside a plain unscented paper napkin and twist the ends closed your 'keet will have a ball shredding the paper and then will find the treats inside sycamore branches are safe for birds and are very eloquently twisted and shaped i like to find these strangely shaped branched and put then in the birds cages to give then new and unusual perches and play areas free too just wedge then securely into the cage you should be able to find branches with several smaller branches going in different directions with a little effort you can wedge these branches securely into the bars on the different sides of your cage just make sure any wood you use is safe and that metals contain no zinc or lead poison to birdies good luck  Hamster Fancy rat Drill bit Knife Sailing Professional wrestling match types Wood carving Menstrual cup Screw Fish and chips Pottery Textile manufacturing Upholstery Hamburger Japanese tea ceremony RISC Weight training Mealy Parrot Comanche Airport American football John Cage Glossary of climbing terms CPU cache Climbing equipment RuneScape quests Lung Strap-on dildo Wire Golf Floppy disk In-N-Out Burger Gauge theory Natural deduction Dog training Christmas tree Canary Casting Swingout Wind turbine Tag Golf club (equipment) CPU design Aerial (dance move) Equine conformation Bullet Falconry Dinghy Salad Fingers Scale model Magnetism Light-emitting diode Professional wrestling throws Mixed martial arts Dai dai shogi Electrophysiology Anchor Taikyoku shogi Professional wrestling holds Explosive material Fire fighting Balloon Domestic rabbit Battery (electricity) Diver rescue Tire Hot dog Topology Anorexia nervosa RuneScape locations Chess opening Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Wood Dog agility Cuisine of Denmark Glossary of American football Trapping Guitar Sento Noah's Ark Seismic retrofit Compiler optimization Slot machine Paragliding Cuisine of the Philippines Helicopter Tai shogi English longbow IUPAC nomenclature Violin Shotgun Escapology Bird Campfire Softball Pinball Morphology of Pachypodium Portsmouth Block Mills Thuja plicata

what do you feed a baby woodpecker me and my friend found a baby woodpcker and we dont know what to feed it we tried feeding it worms but it wont eat we got it to drink water and it keeps flapping its wings but cant fly please answer if you know what could help if the baby has most of its feathers it is a fledgling baby birds fledge leave the nest several days before they can fly they need time to hop around on the ground climb low branches and exercise their wings until they have strengthened them enough for flight the parent birds continue to feed and care for the fledglings until they are self sufficient if this is a fledgling put it back where you found it if the parents can hear it they will return to it and continue to care for it if it is not feathered that much and you think it was still a nestling try to place the bird back in the nest do not worry that you have touched it birds do not have an acute sense of smell the parent birds will not detect your scent on the baby and will not reject it wildlife biologists and bird banders handle baby birds all the time with thier bare hands and the parents never reject the babies if you can not find the nest and place the bird back contact a licensed wildlife rehabilitator you can find one here http www tc umn edu devo contact htm please under no circumstances attempt to care for the baby bird yourself there is so much more to rehabilitation than keeping the animal alive until you think it is ready to be released you have to know not only what to feed the bird but how please do not attempt to give the bird any liquid by dropper baby birds can aspirate and die how much and how often you also have to know how to assess the birds general health and condition a baby bird kept in captivity must be taught to recognize and find the type of food it will eat in the wild if it is being hand fed it may not associate the bugs and berries and seeds in nature as being food it must also have the opportunity to exercise its wings a lot so it will be able to fly on or shortly after release when i volunteered at the avian rehabilitation center we kept the rehabilitating fledglings in a large walk in cage with lots of shelves and branches leading from one shelf to the other and down to the ground we would place different types of food in the cage for them as they were being weaned from the hand feeding formula we offered seed meal worms and chopped up fruit no fledgling was released until it was eating on its own had sufficient weight gain had all of its flight feathers in good condition had no sign of diarreah or nasal discharge had clear eyes and could fly at least a few feet in a straight line these are the reasons to get the bird to a licensed rehabilitator they have the training and the resources necessary to do all this in addition to having the permits to do it all legally all native migratory birds in the us are protected under the migratory bird treaty act and you must have the proper permits to have them even for a short time even for good reasons like saving them many other countries also have similar laws regarding their native species  Breastfeeding Hamster Kakapo Chicken Albatross Bird Seabird Falconry Bird migration Pet skunk Cat Ivory-billed Woodpecker Capercaillie Domestic rabbit Mealy Parrot Condor Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hunting Species Bird ringing Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Acorn Terri Schiavo 613 mitzvot Bat Dinosaur RuneScape quests Livestock Bird flight Insulin Mosquito Guinea pig Gliding Tetrapod H5N1 Foie gras Red Squirrel Elephant Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Comanche Fancy rat Extinction Genetically modified food Ant Kashrut Vegetarianism Dog Hemp Archaeopteryx Airport Insect Hedgehog Sewage treatment Gray Wolf Agriculture Trapping Fox hunting American Black Bear Saruman Heinkel He 112 Dodo Ferret Ostrich Pterosaur Vermicompost Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 Animal testing Rock Dove Gas metal arc welding Infantilism Public domain Baptism Mid-levels Insurance Nurse GNU General Public License Weight training Gypsy moth Coconut crab Shrimp farm Domesticated turkey Fish farming Clark's Nutcracker Egg (food) Mountain Gorilla Alcoholic beverage Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Fecal incontinence Scientology beliefs and practices Trademark Salad Fingers

how to transport my bird to a different location ok well my dad my sister and i and a bunch of other friends are taking a vacation for a week my mom said she'd watch my parakeet budgie i never traveled with my budgie until i got it and it was in a small box we don't have that box anymore and i just thought if it is ok to keep my budgie in her cage and just put a blanket over it i have heard people have done this before but i just wanted to make sure and there is no point in buying a traveling cage carrier because i never travel with my bird any suggestions on what i should do this is an easy one you are right there is no reason to get a travel cage if your cage is portable load the cage up into the car cover her with a towel or sheet after the air is started and off you go if you take a winter trip then cover her with a blanket when leaving the house putting her into a warm car covering her will help her not to be scared dump her water for the trip if its a short one or it will get all over everything if its a long trip make a few stops to let her drink or leave her some cut up grapes to munch on  Shaggy dog story RuneScape quests The Amazing Race Budgerigar Public transport Fire fighting John Cage Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Adventures of Pete & Pete Hamster Knots Landing Poker jargon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Back to the Future Treehouse of Horror V StarCraft: Uprising The Brady Bunch Sauna Professional wrestling match types Futurama (TV series - season 2) Viva La Bam Bird migration Surveillance Who Shot Mr. Burns?

i have budgies i was wondering if cockateil can be in the same cage or will they fight are they gonna fight or not it depends many people are able to keep budgies and teils together as they tend to get along well but you'll need a large cage to comfortably accommodate their varying activity levels follow the typical procedures of introducing a new bird to a cage inhabited by a senior occupant by letting them stay in separate cages besides one another for a few nights if they seem content with each other try housing them together if it works out great if not separate them if the pair goes sour at worst they might nip at each other but they should seriously harm one another so see how it goes they will probably be somewhat aggressive in the beginning when establishing dominance personally keeping them separate seems easier to me and that's what i would do unless you had a very large cage and outgoing birds  Domestic rabbit Hamster Mixed martial arts Canary Electrophysiology John Cage Badminton Breastfeeding Aikido Magic (illusion) Guinea pig Trapping Champagne (beverage) Stereoscopy Infantilism Starfleet ranks and insignia Ferret House Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Acid Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an School bus Kart racing Poker jargon Seabird Roller skating Social rule Bicycle frame Illegal drug trade Cat Prisoner's dilemma Quizbowl Combine (Half-Life 2) Sleep Fancy rat Alignment (role-playing games) Welding Chicken Tweety Bird Airport Computer Yacht Parliamentary system Coconut crab Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Big Brother (USA TV series) Nip/Tuck Divorce Schizophrenia Policy Debate Microphone Consensual crime Dairy Bird Bicycle The Sims Equine conformation Bird migration Porsche 911 RISC The Birds (film) Milton H.

how can you tell when your budgie's beak is getting too long either on the top or on the bottom we already had to have our girl's beak tooled on the bottom once now the bottom's fine but the top is growing we have changed her diet we have a wooden stick a pumice stone and many plastic toys already in her cage i forgot there is also a mineral cuttle stone in the cage and btw sometimes beaks do grow abnormally the vet told us that it is genetic in birds such as ours ok depending on the diet and what you changed the diet from to what it is now it takes some time for this to go stop the over growth of the beak and nails or if it was caught in time i will do my best to explain what is going on this is not a genetic disorder but more of the diet what caused this to happen was the high fat diet it was being fed seeds do this it's the first sign of fatty liver disease the liver can not process the high fat diet so it throws it back into the body cavity which is why you see the fatty tumors over growth of the beak and nails and the thickening of the beak and nails another thing humans maintain the body temp of birds so the high fat diet is not needed which is why outside birds don't have the fat tumors they use up the excess fat for winter storage we also don't give birds the necessary exercise they need to get rid of the excess fat from the diet humans feed them if indeed fatty liver disease is gotten in time it can be reversed depending on a few factors how long the bird had the disease how old the bird is and what diet you are now feeding it what exercise the bird is now getting all of these things factor into the birds life now it can take months up to years to reverse the disease email me with specifics good luck  Nutrition Chicken Omega-3 fatty acid Diabetes mellitus Obesity Milk Prostate cancer Fancy rat Cirrhosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Weight training Coronary heart disease Growth hormone Vitamin Glycogen storage disease type I Alcoholism Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hamster Hypercholesterolemia Insulin Garfield Atkins Nutritional Approach Dieting Kidney Folic acid Ferret Colorectal cancer Hepatitis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Anorexia nervosa Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Protein-energy malnutrition Human height Coeliac disease Breastfeeding Cardiovascular disease Puberty Vitamin D Tocopherol Anemia Stroke Acorn Capercaillie Factory farming Growth hormone treatment Hypertension Trans fat Bird migration Crohn's disease Guinea pig Acne Rheumatoid arthritis Exercise Senescence Homer Simpson Hedgehog Osteoporosis Egg (food) Fatty acid Tobacco smoking Agriculture Cystic fibrosis Domestic rabbit Bird Traumatic brain injury Ovarian cancer Glucocorticoid Calorie restriction Chronic fatigue syndrome Polycystic ovary syndrome Bodybuilding Autism Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Medicine Glucokinase Genetic disorder Mesothelioma Sewage treatment Fecal incontinence Seabird Bottlenose Dolphin Hepatocellular carcinoma Dog Foie gras

what a good price for a cockatiel i found some tht are is that good thanks it depends on where you are what the color mutation is and who you get it from we paid about for a lightly pied male at a pet store about for a gray male at a pet store and for a lutino whiteface pure white bird female from a breeder at a petstore i've priced lutino whitefaced cockatiels to be about gender really doesn't matter while young it is impossible to tell the gender of your cockatiel visually even once the gender is known which for lutinos whitefaces and white faced lutinos you usually either have to rely on genetic tests or on personallity there are still perks to both genders that make the price between them remain relatively even males are more likely to talk and sing and females can breed well that is from a seller's prospective if you know the genders of the birds in question and know you're not going to breed get a male because they won't every have any problems with becoming egg bound even solitary female cockatiels tend to lay eggs obviously infertile which runs them at a high risk of becoming egg bound  Cockatiel Cat Androgen insensitivity syndrome Kakapo Platypus Bird Dog Supply and demand Pet Color Mixed-breed dog Ostrich Egg (food) Contract Horse Dobermann Leatherback Sea Turtle Transgender Pet skunk Canary Infertility Gender Legal aspects of transsexualism Sexual dimorphism Clown Hamster Bird migration Sexual differentiation Species Gender-neutral language In vitro fertilisation German Shepherd Dog Gender identity Domestic rabbit Seabird Dragons (Pern) Chocobo Genetic algorithm RuneScape economy Colorectal cancer Biology and sexual orientation Labrador Retriever Drosophila melanogaster House Mouse Panthera hybrid Organic food Final Fantasy XI Guinea pig Sexual reproduction Economics Skunk Labor theory of value Gender role Osprey Human cloning Sex Transsexuality Human sexual behavior Capitalism Honeybee Egg (biology) Havanese Golden Retriever Uranium Discus (fish) Grammatical gender Schizophrenia Liger Health insurance Puppy mill Tarantula God and gender Intersexuality Sexual selection Catalan grammar Homosexuality and transgender Dragon Booster Black panther Lactose intolerance Friends Order of succession Clownfish Domestic violence Twin Ferret Dog show Border Collie Sexual attraction Bee Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Hyperinflation Monopoly Cancer Non-native pronunciations of English Keynesian economics Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Man English Springer Spaniel Price discrimination

do parrots which speak really mean what they say or they're just conditioned and repeat things for instance if a parrot says''you look sad today'' does he really mean it not sure about everything they say but african grey's are known to have what is called appropriate language for example i walk into my birds room and she's shred newspaper all around the cage she looks at me and says what a mess or i'll be typing away on my computer and she'll say whatch doin i'll answer oh just typing and she'll say whatcha typin is it coincidence i don't know for sure but i don't think so she also will ask for a specific toy none other will do if you try to offer her something else she'll shake her head no over and over until you give her the one she wants  African Grey Parrot Parrot Mealy Parrot John Cage Shawn Michaels Shaggy dog story The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Dead Parrot Perl Meaning of life Color Irene Pepperberg Philosophy of language Python programming language Euphemism Little Britain Written Cantonese Fallout (computer game) Live 8 Senegal Parrot Aphasia Inheritance (computer science) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Autism Invader Zim Objective-C Ontology (computer science) Customs and etiquette of Japan BASIC programming language Common Lisp Stuttering Muslim ibn Aqeel Perl 6 Dexter's Laboratory XML The Sims Cantonese (linguistics) Cryptic crossword Variable Hearing impairment Polymorphism (computer science) Asperger syndrome Shit Crossword Bluetooth Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Computer Conure RuneScape Random Events Quebec French Magic (illusion) Abstraction (computer science) Calvin and Hobbes German grammar Scientology beliefs and practices Dog training Alex (parrot) Taxi Driver African American Vernacular English Friends Function (mathematics) Mixed martial arts Budgerigar English grammar Logo programming language Hey Jude Object (computer science) Chinglish Public domain Species RuneScape quests Compiler optimization Consciousness Religious Society of Friends Database Scheme programming language The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Newspaper Douglas Adams Pointer John Searle Sudoku Kaliyan Vivian Stanshall The Emancipation of Mimi Datatype Contract American and British English differences Pasadena, California Mel Blanc Benchmark (computing) Polish language Gender-neutral language Virtual machine Exact solutions in general relativity Aqua Teen Hunger Force Whose Line Is It Anyway?

why are drafts bad for birds how is it that a bird that is made to live outside and fly through the air isn't supposed to be in a drafty area in the house because we maintain their body tempatures inside a house for the most part most are a seed diet which is a high fat diet and cause an excess of heat built of heat in a birds body they fluff up to release heat that they body has if they are in a draft at the time they fluff up they become ill and that is when they get sick and an upper respitory starts they then habor this until they can not maintain their body heat btw a birds body temp is normally which is high then humans body temp in the australian species of birds parakeets cockatoos they are more prone to fatty liver disease due to a high fat diet from seed diets contrary to popular belief they do not eat seeds in the wild i have studied their diets in the wild for years their main staple are insects which are high in protein even in the african species peanuts sunflower seeds do not grow in africa pet stores use this ploy to make more money out of their customers seeds sell makes them money it shortens the life span of their birds that they sell you when the birds die you go out and buy another bird the bottom line is you keep the pet industry in business by lining their pockets with your money the old way they used to do business and some still use this method is unsanitary conditions of their animals people would feel sorry for the animals so people would buy them to get them out of the pet store it's not practiced much anymore because of the humane society's power today but it's still used in some area's today with over crowding of cages hope this helped you to understand more  Hamster Chicken Fancy rat Hedgehog Guinea pig Dog Domestic rabbit Nutrition Omega-3 fatty acid Dieting Milk Veganism Hypoglycemia Taboo food and drink Atkins Nutritional Approach Acorn Vitamin C Neolithic Revolution Vegetarianism Bread Egg (food) Food Ferret Sorghum Anorexia nervosa Hunting Famine Peanut Weight training Prostate cancer Rice Watermelon Vitamin Raw food diet Cat Bird Seed Thermoregulation Margarine Insulin Domesticated turkey Domestic goat Coeliac disease Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bodybuilding Organic food Equine conformation Protein Human Livestock Agriculture Stone Age Cancer Oily fish Decompression sickness Domestication Fatty acid Tsetse fly Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Vermicompost Orca Tocopherol Kashrut Saturated fat Shrimp farm Budgerigar Eye Breastfeeding Biodiesel Frugivore Vegetarian nutrition Honeybee Parrot Coconut crab Fugu Human skin color Senescence Crohn's disease Natural Hygiene Calorie restriction Tasmanian Devil Insect Feral cat Poker jargon Extinction Sunflower

help needed to tame cockatiels i have cockatiels a male and a female both approx months old i knew that getting two would mean they were less tame but i didn't want one to be on it's own at first i could get them on my hand but since having to towel them to get them back in the cage they seem to have lost their trust in me and now won't come near me at all they are in a very large parrot cage but i still want to be able to take them out for exercise would adding another bird a hand fed one be a really bad idea any suggestions they are petrified of me one won't even take millet their favourite through the cage bars from me they seem to take their cues from each other one freaks the other out etc thought that if they see a calmer bird being handled they might copy realise that being handled is ok hi your problem is not uncommon you have lost your birds trust by as you say towelling them can i suggest that you first gain their confidence by not attempting to go near the cage for a few days what i mean is don't stand over them give them time to see that you are no longer a threat then leave their cage door open if they come out then let them find their own way back this will happen when they become hungry and the cage is their only source of food don't offer any inducement at this time if they are hungry they will find their way in place a sprig of millet spray in the door way and hopefully this will entice them into the cage when they go into the cage don't rush to close the door just leave it till they settle down then gently close it you have to gain their trust again and it is of no use trying to rush this be patient and you will gain their trust again it will take time but you will get there  Hamster Cockatiel Professional wrestling match types Plame affair Trapping Domestic rabbit Mixed martial arts Menstrual cup Kasparov versus The World Social rule Kakapo RuneScape quests Steel Cage Match Mealy Parrot Jason Reso Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Salad Fingers Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Shaggy dog story Parrot Obesity Sento Romulus and Remus Ruy Lopez Montreal Screwjob Bird House Mouse NWo The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Boom Town (Doctor Who) Falconry Ferret Breastfeeding Magic (illusion) Seabird The Ersatz Elevator Muslim ibn Aqeel Antenna (radio) Albatross Colony in Space Customs and etiquette of Japan Wolfrider Jean Grey Breath of Fire III Humphrey Bogart Saruman Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Equine conformation Second Battle of the Atlantic Shifting cultivation National Kidney Foundation Singapore Sola fide Fire fighting Tour de France Ron and Fez Chinchilla Chicken Champagne (beverage) Super Bowl XIV The Contender (television series) Fancy rat Common cold Punt (boat) Ashton-Tate 2005 English cricket season Douglas Adams Atkins Nutritional Approach M16 (rifle) Johnny Cage Garfield Sydney Riot of 1879 Conspiracy (TNG episode) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Doctor Dances One Tree Hill (TV series) Electrophysiology RuneScape Random Events Canary StarCraft: Uprising Ric Flair Futurama (TV series - season 2) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy 1957 World Series Emu Time travel Eddie Guerrero The Ark in Space The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Airport Textile manufacturing Journey (band) Sub-Zero Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Asthma Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Charles Darwin's illness Paul Wight

african grey or macaw which should i get are there any differences in these birds intelligence wise life span ect thank you depending on how old you are know that both are like sending a child to college on the amount of the cost a grey does not demand the cage space a macaw does a macaw also has a loud scream compare to a grey macaws will voice their opinions more so then a grey and need to be vocal where as a grey will and can tend to be more noise makers greys can be plucker's if you modify their daily schedule in the slightest both can live to be with a proper diet of pellets and veggies pasta meat cheese fruits and table food both have specific food requirements greys have a vitamin a and d deficiencies while the macaw needs a high protein diet which is found in meat both are found to die of fatty liver disease which cuts into their life span drastically the macaws tend to get nasty when they hit sexual maturity and if you have never had a bird i would not reccomend one as a first bird a macaw has a lb beak pressure and for that reason alone they can be intimidating to a new bird owner you can not fear a beak on a macaw or they will rule you most macaw cages have play pen tops why it's the most stupid things cage designers have done who knows macaws should never be above your eye level that means never allow the bird on your shoulder if you choose a macaw macaws do more damage to people's faces sitting on shoulders then i have seen in all my years yrs the intelligence wise both have the intelligence of yr old children but so do cockatoos i do not beleive the greys are the talkers i have dealt with cockatoos that are much smarter then a grey could ever be never saw a grey pick a pad lock and then place the key back where they got it from and look to see if anyone saw them do it lol other species of birds were never tested yet that's all the diets are important so you want a baby that has the right diet the more variety of foods you feed the healthier the bird will be feeding one thing is not going to make your bird healthy feed it what you eat and off your table will give the bird the variety of vitamins proteins and minerals the bird needs to be healthy what bird you pick is entirely up to you know that it's a life time commitment and think now that if something might change in your life this kid isn't leaving home for the rest of your life it's something you will be passing onto your relatives if you feed it properly so if your life style changes or you go to college this bird will be with you don't make this decision lightly good luck with your decison  Domestic rabbit Nutrition Veganism Guinea pig Vegetarianism Vitamin C Hamster Chicken Mealy Parrot Dieting Milk Omega-3 fatty acid Fecal incontinence Genetically modified food Hypoglycemia Breastfeeding Vitamin Dog Egg (food) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Vitamin D Anemia Hyacinth Macaw Atkins Nutritional Approach Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Food Fancy rat Livestock Hedgehog Raw food diet Protein Cyanocobalamin Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an African Grey Parrot Fugu Coeliac disease Kashrut Soybean Tooth Vegetarian nutrition Colorectal cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Human skin color Acne Bird Orca Cirrhosis Diabetes mellitus Insulin Healthy eating Hun-Apu Dairy Growth hormone treatment Adjustable gastric band Conure Low-carbohydrate diet Tlingit Factory farming Macaw Food guide pyramid Natural Selection (computer game) Explosive material Hamburger Cancer Social rule Carpal tunnel syndrome Cheese Welding Cholesterol Puberty Alzheimer's disease Sea-Monkey Pasta Cat Shotgun Ferret Mahjong Spider Capercaillie Chronic fatigue syndrome Kakapo 613 mitzvot Soy milk Education in the United States Trapping Albatross Species Obesity Equine conformation

why do owls only flie at night they don't there are about different species of owl and only about of those are strictly nocturnal the reason we beleive owls to be nocturnal is due to several things for a start owls hunt by using extremly sensitive hearing at night the world is a lot quiter so it's easier for the owl to find it's prey also most of the owls we see in resedential areas barn owl tawny owl ect tend to hunt small rodent mainly short tailed voles these rodents are more active at night and therefore it is sensible for the owl to be hunting them at that time a good way to tell the difference if an owl has a light coloured iris eg yellow or orange eyes it will hunt in the daytime or the night if it has a dark coloured iris black or brown eyes it is a more nocturnal hunter however i have seen barn owls out hunting at in the afternoon before during the breeding season if the owls have owletts to feed nocturnal birds will hunt during the day  Owl Leopard Barn Owl Snowy Owl Cheetah Capercaillie Collared Scops Owl Color Tytonidae Cat Stoat Indian Scops Owl Seabird Hamster Eye Red Squirrel Nocturnal animal Burrowing Owl Hunting Pit viper Eastern Screech Owl Southern Boobook Bat Falconry Platypus Iris (anatomy) Tyrannosaurus rex Peafowl Scops owl Kakapo Great Horned Owl Barred Owl Noctowl Spider Tasmanian Devil Great Grey Owl Peregrine Falcon Ural Owl Thermoregulation Vole Laughing Owl Gray Wolf Camouflage Light pollution Tawny Frogmouth Bird Skunk Typical owl Color vision Unreal Eye color Diagon Alley Horse Mushroom hunting Red Fox Northern Flying Squirrel Discworld gods Kevin and Kell Auk Vampire Mountain Beaver Extinct birds Puma Bird of prey Ferret Minor Harry Potter Beasts D'ni wildlife Mothman Tuatara Color blindness Nighthawk Brown Bear American Alligator Bird migration Night monkey James McNeill Whistler Bulborb Muir Woods National Monument Degu Clouded Leopard Beaver Muskrat Taikyoku shogi Conker's Bad Fur Day Laotian Rock Rat Little Owl Meriones unguiculatus Steppe Eagle Colugo Guinea pig Mega Man X4 Trapping American lobster Mosquito San Francisco Municipal Railway Sheffield Wednesday F.C.

do birds need regular vet check ups i know if they are you are supposed to take them to the vet but do they need like shots and regular vet visits i want to get my first pet bird i don't want nothing fancy though just a parakeet my mom is making me pay for everything so i do have a fairley low budget i'm only by the way also do they need like their nails cut and stuff like that basically do they need anything else besides there basic needs and attention is there anything else i need to pay for throughout its life besides the supplies and the bird no vet visits unless something is wrong if you plan on handling it it's a good idea to trim the nails and the wings if you are too afraid to do this it's easy i'm sure your local vet would probably do it for free just one thing don't use the sandpaper perches to keep their nails from being sharp they just irritate their feet good luck  Garfield Pet skunk Hamster Knife Nine Inch Nails Pottery Falconry Milton H.

baby birds my yr old entergetic beagle found a nest in between chairs today not knowing if there was any birds inside we left him alone he came back with a baby in his mouth we alerted him to drop and we picked up the bird with gloves back into the nest we moved the chairs out of the yard and around the house was this the right thing to do i would say they are only a couple of weeks old we hope the mother bird can find them you need to put the nest back as close as possible to where it originally was or the parents will not be able to find it you did the right thing by putting the bird back in the nest is there a way you can keep the dog away from the nest until the babies leave it block off the chairs somehow so he will not disturb them again they should not be there too long most passerines perching birds fledge leave the nest at about weeks of age if the bird was mostly feathered it should be leaving the nest soon keep in mind the babies will leave the nest before they can fly they will hop around and the parents will feed them you might want to keep your dog clear of that area until they move on as the baby birds will be vulnerable and easy for you dog to catch until they learn to fly  Kakapo Bird Albatross Capercaillie Seabird Falconry Bird migration Peafowl Passerine Bird ringing Dog training Rainbow Bee-eater Brolga RuneScape quests White-throated Dipper Dinosaur Platypus Hamster Ivory-billed Woodpecker Professional wrestling aerial techniques AFI 100 Years series Aerial (dance move) Nile crocodile Condor Piccolo Junior Saga Western Gull Richard Rahl Carrion Crow House Martin Dog The Inside The Family from One End Street Friends Jam (TV series) Barn Swallow Chicken Prairie Falcon Infantilism Rook (bird) Bird flight Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Black-footed Albatross Big Bird Breastfeeding Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Mario Gal__pagos Islands Archaeopteryx Piratic Flycatcher Scissor-tailed Flycatcher Brown-headed Cowbird European Nightjar Bird of prey Prenatal diagnosis African Fish Eagle Island restoration Milton H.

ah found a injured bird on the lawn what do i do i saw it fall from the roof and it was hopping around then it went into a dark corner and stopped hopping i watched it for a while from a faraway distance and still it didnt move i put it in a box with a towel so far now what i called the animal shelter and vet but they said they were busy and told me to bring the bird in next weekkkkk so now what it is a little finch i looked it up in a book and stuff but dont know what to do how do i feed it when should i let it go how to tell if its a baby its about and inches if you can not find the nest and place the bird back contact a licensed wildlife rehabilitator you can find one here http www tc umn edu devo contact htm please under no circumstances attempt to care for the baby bird yourself there is so much more to rehabilitation than keeping the animal alive until you think it is ready to be released you have to know not only what to feed the bird but how please do not attempt to give the bird any liquid by dropper baby birds can aspirate and die how much and how often you also have to know how to assess the birds general health and condition a baby bird kept in captivity must be taught to recognize and find the type of food it will eat in the wild if it is being hand fed it may not associate the bugs and berries and seeds in nature as being food it must also have the opportunity to exercise its wings a lot so it will be able to fly on or shortly after release when i volunteered at the avian rehabilitation center we kept the rehabilitating fledglings in a large walk in cage with lots of shelves and branches leading from one shelf to the other and down to the ground we would place different types of food in the cage for them as they were being weaned from the hand feeding formula we offered seed meal worms and chopped up fruit no fledgling was released until it was eating on its own had sufficient weight gain had all of its flight feathers in good condition had no sign of diarreah or nasal discharge had clear eyes and could fly at least a few feet in a straight line these are the reasons to get the bird to a licensed rehabilitator they have the training and the resources necessary to do all this in addition to having the permits to do it all legally all native migratory birds in the us are protected under the migratory bird treaty act and you must have the proper permits to have them even for a short time even for good reasons like saving them many other countries also have similar laws regarding their native species edit please do not call or listen to anyone who offers to help you step by step to save this bird as noted it is illegal to keep the bird even for the noble purpose of saving it it must be turned over to a licensed professional and nestlouie it is very foolish for anyone to give their phone number on a forum like this it is dangerous anyone can see it and call you for any reason please be more careful in the future also please do not make public offers to help someone do something illegal do not encourage this person do anything other than take the bird to a licensed wildlife rehabilitator  Hamster Falconry Pet skunk Chicken Domestic rabbit Breastfeeding Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Guinea pig Hunting Bird migration Kakapo Bird Livestock Seabird Professional wrestling attacks Albatross 613 mitzvot Hemp Foie gras Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Ferret Acorn Cat Sin City Mealy Parrot Billboard (advertising) Dog agility Mixed martial arts Boxing Terri Schiavo Species H5N1 RuneScape quests GNU General Public License Capercaillie Peanut Bird ringing Contract Baseball Bat Trapping Airport Fancy rat The Time Machine Kashrut Gliding Garfield Sewage treatment Genetically modified food Extinction Scientology beliefs and practices Professional wrestling match types Elephant Public domain Cannabis cultivation Ivory-billed Woodpecker Saruman Glossary of American football Peregrine Falcon Triage Nurse Gray Wolf Sampling (music) Aerial (dance move) Paintball Vegetarianism Intellectual property Dog Nuclear power Insulin Towra Point Nature Reserve Ostrich International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement Equine conformation Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Tenshinhan Care Bears Taikyoku shogi Glossary of partner dance terms Gerald Durrell Social work Gas metal arc welding Church of Scientology Agriculture Medical prescription Canary Dinosaur Comanche Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act

budgie problems hey everyone well i really need some help you see i have a now month old budgie and everything was fine and dandy but now that's all changed see this one time i took him out of his cage and tried to see if he would want to take a bath in a bowl of shallow water and he did not like that at all so now every time i try to take him out of his cage to hold him or something he runs away from me or flies to the other side of the cage what can i do to get him to trust me again and let me take him out of his cage without himmoving away please help also has a pet store person ever been wrong about the gender of your bird is it likely that they would be wrong most of the time also what age are most budgies when their gender shows and do pet store people look at anything else besides the cere to find out the the birds gender p s i'll give best answer to anyone who helps me out alot on this p later at four months the cere should be showing the right colors there aren't many ways to be positive other than the cere color but males are more vocal females are more territorial females have more pinkish feet that's about it since you scared him with the bath it happens a lot with smaller birds try just taking him in the shower with you or steaming up the bathroom it's just going to take time for him to trust you again just feed him lots of treats give him his space and don't force him to do anything if he doesn't get more trusting within a week or so take him out of the cage toweling works but it's better if you can just pick him up gently and let him run around for a while he'll soon realize that you're not going to try to give him a bath again and that he can come out of the cage without being afraid pet store people are wrong a lot about genders of animals because they are not informed or just want to sound intelligent by making something up with budgies usually they wont be wrong unless the bird was just a baby and they didn't realize it all babies look like males if you have any other questions or my answers made no sense i'm kind of tired feel free to email me  Sento Social rule Domestic rabbit Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Gender identity Diving Chinchilla Guinea pig Fancy rat Ferret Pet skunk Toilet Chicken Changeroom W.I.T.C.H.

breeding question please answer i want to get a couple of finches and breed them and when they are old enough my grandmother wants them i'm not giving them to her as a gift she knows about them so don't worry about that can i just get them from petsmart do you think they are healthy enough should i just get a male and female and they will mate or is there anything i can do to uhh i guess seduce them to make them want to mate i know what to do after the egg is layed and all about caring for the babies but i dont know how to get them to mate help or should i try to find a breeding pair of finches i really want to breed birds not much maybe only or clutches at the most so i wont be adding to much to the unwanted pet population because i already have a home for the babies just letting yall know yes i know kjh please just ahead of time dont answer my question if you are telling me not to breed them just letting you know the birds already have a home once they are old enough so do i need a special cage or will a regular cage do last question probably not i already have a female cockatiel will the new birds laying eggs promote her to laying eggs i know that was a lot to read so thanks for listening i'm not familiar with finches but i'm sure they aren't any different from any other bird if you get un bonded finches it may take them a while to actually bond them start mating so in my honest opinion you're better off buying a pair that is proven breeders one's that have proven to lay eggs that were fertile i see no problem in breeding any bird as long as it's done correctly you know exactly what your doing and you breed species that are in demand and i do see allot of people wanting to buy finches now if you said you wanted to breed say canaries i'd have to disagree because i've been searcing the internet allot of online classified ad's and i have not yet found any one wanting to buy canaries and before i got my budgie my bf took me to a breeder he knew that he got all his birds off of when he was into birds several years ago and the man only breeds canaries now and i know there was at least cages if not more stacked up all around a add on room of his garage and each cage had at least canaries in them no one is buying them but finches i see people wanting them all the time i say as long as you truly know what your doing and you've already got good loving caring homes for them good for it if you go here http www drsfostersmith com product navresults cfm n it shows you different nesting boxes and i think the nesting finch tiki hut is kinda cool lookin i'm sure you can find them cheaper some where else or maybe not i just bought a flight suit for my quaker from them and they were the cheapest place i found one but at least it gives you an idea of what a finches nesting box looks like  Bird Chicken Canary Hamster Domestic rabbit Dog Platypus Species Kakapo RuneScape quests Emu Non-human animal sexuality Ostrich Chaffinch Budgerigar Cockatiel Theory of conduct Leatherback Sea Turtle Inception of Darwin's theory John Cage Animal communication Peregrine Falcon Falconry Egg (biology) Dragons (Pern) Bobwhite Quail Egg (food) Albatross Hybrid Mallard Charles Darwin EastEnders Condor Pet Guinea pig Social rule Capercaillie Penguin Ferret Bird migration Garfield Discus (fish) Trapping Sesame Street Ant Spider Mixed-breed dog Clownfish Kiwi Pet skunk Sexual dimorphism The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Monogamy Dinosaur The Birds (film) Osprey Mosquito House Mouse Monster Rancher monsters Friends Honeybee Dunnock Beetle Blue Tit The Ersatz Elevator Ocean's Twelve Musk Duck Breastfeeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Piece minor characters The Origin of Species Rhea (bird) AFI 100 Years series Sexual reproduction The Contender (television series) Nile crocodile Roseate Tern Peafowl Life in the Freezer Bagworm moth Great Bustard Past teachings of Prem Rawat Liger Jennifer Lopez Livestock Africanized bee Aphid Bee One Tree Hill (TV series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Darwin from Orchids to Variation Haven (TNG episode) Knots Landing

of all pets are any animals more restricted and imprisoned than birds held in cages fish are allowed to swim in their tanks as restricted as they are dogs and cats have a fair amount of freedom but holding a bird in a small cage like most pet birds are is a different story birds in the wild can soar on wing at their choosing and to keep them in a home in small cages is an abomination think about it would you like to be kept in a box never allowed to walk or run or even frolic in any way some people have just bird so it would be you all alone in your box doesn't the saying free as a bird mean anything to you bird owners obviously i'm speaking about people who keep birds in tiny cages inside their homes what a horrible life for a bird john p if you bothered to inform yourself instead of making comments about a subject of which you obviously know absolutely nothing if you bothered to read my post you'd know i wasn't talking about those people your defensive protest makes me wonder if you're doing it out of guilt would you ever let a domesticated bird out in the wild to die i would never have one to begin with do you ever look at the sky and see a bird flying your bird will never have that freedom you might offer better conditions than most but it's still unfair i'll repost this portion of my original post as all of you have ignored it obviously i'm speaking about people who keep birds in tiny cages inside their homes instead of accusing me of generalizing and such understand that i'm talking about people who keep birds in small cages where they can't fly at will if you keep your bird in a cage it should be open at all times except for company and such or you're imprisoning the bird you can defend doing it all you want but it doesn't change the fact that you deprive your pet of even a remotely natural existence do you know wwy your bird seems happy around you it's all that it has btw anyone who has just bird is an offender on a deeper level no matter what you think your bird is lonely you don't compensate for that there's no birds in the wild out seeking human companionship in general i agree that's why my parrots cage is always open and he can roam as he pleases  Theory of conduct The Amber Spyglass Public domain Ferret Slander and libel Hamster Pet Garfield Sinfest Bird Salad Fingers Fancy rat Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Original sin European Convention on Human Rights Aladdin (1992 film) Burrhus Frederic Skinner RuneScape quests Kosher foods Livestock Theodicy John Cage Poker jargon American individualist anarchism Philosophy of language Freedom of speech H5N1 Feral cat Pet skunk Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) House Chicken Surveillance Zoophilia Social justice Liberal Democrats (UK) The Human Stain Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong GNU General Public License God Emperor of Dune Domestication Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Mealy Parrot Goodness and value theory Scientology beliefs and practices Vietnam War Professional wrestling match types Canary German grammar Dog training Mumia Abu-Jamal Capitalism Snoopy Taikyoku shogi Seabird Hunting Jury trial Species Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Prior restraint Kakapo Gaia Online Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Yoko Ono RuneScape locations The Death Gate Cycle Falconry Abortion debate Sant Thakar Singh Donkey Kong's Animal Buddies Reality Sin City Plame affair Albatross Energy development Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Schapelle Corby Sleep Bat Fish farming Dog agility Criticisms of Christianity Scenes from a Memory Zoo Pet store Ward Churchill The Raven Rudolf Steiner African Grey Parrot City of Heroes Shaggy dog story

how do you care for an adolescent robin one of our neighborhood children actually snatched an adolescent robin right from it's nest sigh i found him playing with it on my porch and i've taken it away from him since it has been handled by children and i don't even know where the nest is i can't just put it back the bird seems to have about of it's flight feathers i have no idea what i should try to feed it my husband suggested a mash of worms but we are having a harsh heat wave and all the worms seem to be in hiding help are you sure they took it out of the nest if the baby has most of its feathers it is a fledgling baby birds fledge leave the nest several days before they can fly they need time to hop around on the ground climb low branches and exercise their wings until they have strengthened them enough for flight the parent birds continue to feed and care for the fledglings until they are self sufficient if this is a fledgling ask the children where they found it and place it in a low bush near that area if the parents can hear it they will return to it and continue to care for it if it is not feathered that much and you think it was still a nestling try to get the children to show you where the nest is you can place the bird back in the nest do not worry that you have touched it birds do not have an acute sense of smell the parent birds will not detect your scent on the baby and will not reject it wildlife biologists and bird banders handle baby birds all the time with thier bare hands and the parents never reject the babies if you can not find the nest and place the bird back contact a licensed wildlife rehabilitator you can find one here http www tc umn edu devo contact htm please under no circumstances attempt to care for the baby bird yourself there is so much more to rehabilitation than keeping the animal alive until you think it is ready to be released you have to know not only what to feed the bird but how please do not attempt to give the bird any liquid by dropper baby birds can aspirate and die how much and how often you also have to know how to assess the birds general health and condition a baby bird kept in captivity must be taught to recognize and find the type of food it will eat in the wild if it is being hand fed it may not associate the bugs and berries and seeds in nature as being food it must also have the opportunity to exercise its wings a lot so it will be able to fly on or shortly after release when i volunteered at the avian rehabilitation center we kept the rehabilitating fledglings in a large walk in cage with lots of shelves and branches leading from one shelf to the other and down to the ground we would place different types of food in the cage for them as they were being weaned from the hand feeding formula we offered seed meal worms and chopped up fruit no fledgling was released until it was eating on its own had sufficient weight gain had all of its flight feathers in good condition had no sign of diarreah or nasal discharge had clear eyes and could fly at least a few feet in a straight line these are the reasons to get the bird to a licensed rehabilitator they have the training and the resources necessary to do all this in addition to having the permits to do it all legally all native migratory birds in the us are protected under the migratory bird treaty act and you must have the proper permits to have them even for a short time even for good reasons like saving them many other countries also have similar laws regarding their native species  Breastfeeding Hamster Albatross Seabird Bird Bird migration Pet skunk Domestic rabbit Falconry Capercaillie Hunting Dinosaur Cat Species Mealy Parrot Terri Schiavo Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Platypus Bird ringing Condor Dog Gliding 613 mitzvot Peafowl Ivory-billed Woodpecker Ant Bat Guinea pig Tetrapod Livestock Insulin Elephant Airport Ostrich H5N1 Comanche Extinction Archaeopteryx Ferret Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Diabetes mellitus Vegetarianism Acorn Bird flight Peregrine Falcon Genetically modified food RuneScape quests Fancy rat Foie gras Vermicompost Hemp Mosquito Heinkel He 112 Saruman Gas metal arc welding Insect Tasmanian Devil Rock Dove Domesticated turkey Haibane Renmei European Magpie Infantilism Public domain Agriculture Fox hunting Trapping Computer virus American Black Bear Space Shuttle Columbia disaster American Robin Nurse Canary Wind power Nile crocodile Snake Coconut crab Hummingbird Animal testing Gray Wolf Life in the Freezer Sense Medicine Pterosaur Prostate cancer Divorce Psychiatric hospital Feathered dinosaurs Bee Gypsy moth

bird parrot experts i wanted to know if anybody has an unclipped pet bird that flies but won't fly 'away' or do you think it's possible that a bird could be attached to a human to the point of him flying away not being an issue like people are relatively confident that a dog won't just run off usually can a bird be that reliable hi there is no guarantee with it happening someone had of my handreared sun conures it took to her like nothing i have ever seen before it would not leave her shoulder she used to go out in the garden and do the gardening with it sat there on her shoulder its never flown off but then on the other hand i would never ever take such a chance yes they could get attached to the point they wont fly but all it takes is for a very loud bang maybe a dry thunder someones car horn and no matter how attached to you the bird is theres the possibility it could get spooked and just fly without thinking then it may find itself stuck up a tree scared to move only takes a crow or another bird to try to attack it and you can say bye to it as u'll not get it back in my opinion its not worth risking it even clipped birds have the ability to fly they only need to be out and catch a strong air current open their wings and they are gone according to a survey over half the birds that exscaped last year had clipped wings just goes to show nothing is safe really in my opinion no they cannot be that reliable  Glossary of climbing terms Kakapo Professional wrestling throws Falconry Bird Taikyoku shogi Aerial (dance move) Creatures in Bionicle New York Giants Conure Rugby union positions M16 (rifle) Garfield Baseball Gliding Professional wrestling holds Heinkel He 112 Equine conformation Dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Paragliding American football Doom enemies Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Chicken Knife Bat Dog agility Professional wrestling aerial techniques Expert system Roswell UFO incident Pittsburgh Steelers Jeopardy!

i found a baby bird help we are remodeling our back porch and while we were cleaning it off we found a nest w baby birds in our bird house we already moved the bird house to a different location will they survive will their mom find them if their mom does not find them how can i keep them from not dying so far i put in bird seed just so they have the option to eat something but they keep on tweeting i can not open the bird house in any way to get the bird more food plz help me any ideas or options i will take i really want the birds to survive help yes it is a wild bird i did not touch them only the bird house first if the parents can hear the babies they can find them second it does not matter if you touched the birdhouse or the babies birds do not have an acute sense of smell and the parent birds will not detect your scent on the babies wildlife biologists and bird banders handle baby birds all the time with their bare hands and the parent birds do not reject the babies third the parents see people as predators they will not come back to their babies as long as there are people in the area fourth never place bird seed in an active birdhouse or nest baby birds do not eat seed and it can attract predators that can harm or kill the babies fifth with all the commotion created by the work you are doing on your porch and a lot of people around the parent birds might have fled the area abandoning their babies you need to watch the birdhouse for at least hours after everyone is out of sight you need to watch it from a spot where you can see it clearly but the parent birds can not see you do not stop watching it the parent birds could flit in feed the babies and flit out again in a matter of seconds if after hours you have not seen the parent birds come back contact a licensed wildlife rehabilitator you can find one here http www tc umn edu devo contact htm please under no circumstances attempt to care for the baby birds yourself there is so much more to rehabilitation than keeping the animal alive until you think it is ready to be released you have to know not only what to feed the bird but how please do not attempt to give the bird any liquid by dropper baby birds can aspirate and die how much and how often you also have to know how to assess the birds general health and condition a baby bird kept in captivity must be taught to recognize and find the type of food it will eat in the wild if it is being hand fed it may not associate the bugs and berries and seeds in nature as being food it must also have the opportunity to exercise its wings a lot so it will be able to fly on or shortly after release when i volunteered at the avian rehabilitation center we kept the rehabilitating fledglings in a large walk in cage with lots of shelves and branches leading from one shelf to the other and down to the ground we would place different types of food in the cage for them as they were being weaned from the hand feeding formula we offered seed meal worms and chopped up fruit no fledgling was released until it was eating on its own had sufficient weight gain had all of its flight feathers in good condition had no sign of diarreah or nasal discharge had clear eyes and could fly at least a few feet in a straight line these are the reasons to get the bird to a licensed rehabilitator they have the training and the resources necessary to do all this in addition to having the permits to do it all legally all native migratory birds in the us are protected under the migratory bird treaty act and you must have the proper permits to have them even for a short time even for good reasons like saving them many other countries also have similar laws regarding their native species  Hamster Kakapo Breastfeeding Chicken Pet skunk Falconry Seabird Albatross Cat Hunting Bird migration Bird Domestic rabbit Extinction Capercaillie Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Terri Schiavo H5N1 Species Mealy Parrot 613 mitzvot Bat Acorn Gray Wolf Ferret Mosquito Fox hunting Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Dinosaur Tasmanian Devil Fancy rat Dodo Livestock Dog Orca Kashrut Elephant Genetically modified food Trapping Hedgehog Peafowl Vegetarianism Shark Foie gras Red Squirrel American Black Bear Poker jargon Bird ringing Airport Animal communication Insulin Peanut Saruman Hemp Public domain Agriculture Condor Ant Sewage treatment Gliding Vermicompost Scientology beliefs and practices Mid-levels Egg (food) Fire fighting Insect Spider Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Tetrapod RuneScape quests Diabetes mellitus Nile crocodile Tyrannosaurus rex Gypsy moth Skunk Adoption Psychiatric hospital Ostrich Shrimp farm Beetle Animal rights Salad Fingers Tenshinhan International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement Foodborne illness Insurance Charmed Dog agility Blue Whale Canary Hummingbird Abortion debate

is there any hope i have a month old congo african grey and he is a peach to my husband and i but no so much to the kids he will let them pet him on occasion but he is a brat for the most part is there anything i can do to make him friendlier i tried socializing him but he tries to eat everyone therefore noone will touch him he is not my first bird i have plenty of experience i know how hard it is to raise a grey and i wasnt interested but my husband got him for himself and now here he is he wanst meant to be mine but he is very bonded to me anyway i give him plenty of attention since he is practically attached to my head and i try to get the kids involved but he is not having it is it too late to help him be more social giving him up is not an option since we have grown quite attached to him and his antics but it would be nice if he was friendlier at least to my kids also he has been weaned for about weeks now but he is starting to beg for food again should i let him regress and go back to formula or can i gently deter him from it im an experienced hand feeder oh boy he does step up but i do allow him to come out on his own he eats anything and everything you put in front of him and drinks water i stopped feeding him because he started refusing it we tried everything to get him to take his formula but he wouldnt take it im guessing i shouldnt let him fly to my head huh he tried it on my bald husband with painful results and i do get him off and tell him no but as soon as he sees me he flies to my head greys really are like another child patience patience he is a young bird and therefore will learn very easily the problem is that you have been letting him make the decisions every time you let him get away with these things it reinforces his belief that he is doing the right thing spend less time with him yourself and have the other family members spend more time with him i know that you want to spend time with him but cut back drastically on the time you give him let his companionship come mostly from the others do not give him any treats yourself let him learn that if he wants yummy treats he will have to take them from the children if he refuses these treats have them taken away and do not let the children drop them into his food bowl or into his cage when he sees that he gets treats only by socializing with the children he will eventually open up if he bites or misbehaves make him to or repetitions of step up to show him that you are in charge he will open up to the rest of the family as long as you make it clear to him that he must good luck  Breastfeeding Dog training Domestic rabbit Infantilism Guinea pig Social rule Maison Ikkoku Son Goku (Dragon Ball) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The Contender (television series) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kodocha Stuttering Trapping 2000 Australian Grand Prix Falconry Alcoholics Anonymous Fancy rat Hamster Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Aerial (dance move) Microeconomics Chicken Burrhus Frederic Skinner Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Dog Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 About a Boy Capercaillie Transactional analysis W.I.T.C.H.

pregnant and have birds is it ok please read i just recently moved and i feel happy but i feel sad i was living with my parents and i couldnt take it anymore i am about months pregnant and i have birds parakeets and i feel so sad that i cant take them with me my bf keep telling me that you cant have a newborn with pets and it really hurt me because i had one of my birds for over years and the other for about years its hard to part with them i just wonder if it is true that i cant have my birds there with me i love them to death and this move is such bitter sweet you certainly can have pets even with a newborn in fact some studies show children who grow up with pets in the home have less chance of developing allergies the only pet concern is with cats and with those its a matter of who cleans the litterbox due to toxoplasmosis while it won't hurt the mother it could affect an unborn child so if you were to have cats someone else would need to clean the litterbox for you go get your birds  Toxoplasmosis Cat Pregnancy Knots Landing Kodocha Pitaten Melanie Wilkes Ferret Guinea pig Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Pet Breastfeeding The Fairly OddParents Ranma __ characters Peter Pan Abortion debate Ron Weasley Friends Miscarriage Neighbours College Roomies from Hell!!!

food for keet with deformed beak actually kiichou his name means precious when he was a small baby got his beak injured somehow or another to the point that his top beak section points down instead of curving and his bottom beak section is unusually small his beak is also very weak he can eat regular bird food but thats pretty much it he cant even open a sunflower seed i open one or two for him everynow and then any ideas on what kinds of fruits and other foods thats would be easy for him to eat it cant be too hard or too soft it also cant make him work to get it like nuts and it must be small or break into small peices long lists would be appericated and please dont try an educate me about parakeets because i have been a tamer and breeder for years now and also his beak will always be this way because he is a year old and it grows that way now btw hes tame enough to hop on my finger and whatnot but i cant take him out of the cage yet anyones help would be most appericiated x i am surprised that you would expect a parakeet to be able to open a sunflower seed even with a normal beak most of my parakeets in over years of owning them have beaks too small to open a sunflower seed anyway i have had a couple of birds who've had injured beaks like what you describe and they seem to do well on the spray millet i have over birds right now so i also like to cook up a large bag of success rice brown or white minutes in the microwave remove the bag of rice and allow it to drain and while its draining throw about one cup of frozen mixed veggies into the still hot water to defrost once the veggies are defrosted drain the water and mix in the drained rice sometimes the green beans are a bit too large for my smaller birds so i cut those up a little more while they are still frozen anyway all my fids feathered kids seem to like the mix finches to cockatoos and i know they are getting a good vitamin and carb combination too if you only have a few birds you might also try cooking up some frozen mixed veggies into some birdy bread using the different flavors of jiffy mix cake or muffin mixes that way you can use regular cupcake or tiny muffin pans and freeze what you can't use right away when its time to defrost another one just pull it from your freezer pop it in the microwave for about seconds and viola soft edibles hope this helps you little fellow out some and reserve lots of special kisses for the special needs fids  Tofu Bread Hamster Food Domesticated turkey Breakfast Cuisine of the Philippines Cuisine of Denmark Bong Japanese cuisine Ice cream Chicken Rice Cuisine of Malaysia Muffin Fancy rat In-N-Out Burger Acorn Refrigerator Brewery Food preservation Potato Sushi Kosher foods Hamburger The Legend of Zelda series enemies Common bean Dim sum Watermelon Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME MRE Peanut Pizza Curry Piccolo Junior Saga French cuisine Bengali cuisine Jewish cuisine Seed Hot dog Date Palm Kakapo RuneScape skills Cuisine of the Southern United States Kitchen Roman eating and drinking Cheese Poker jargon Pine Tlingit Apple Domestic rabbit Egg (food) Fast bowling Flour Shotgun Vegetarianism Chili con carne Drill bit Cereal Hemp Pet skunk Quinoa Bagel Slow cooker Vinegar Canary Pancake Maize Capercaillie Tea Fruit McDonald's Microwave oven Ramen Pysanka Soul food Bladderwort Vegetarian cuisine Prostate cancer Veganism Textile manufacturing Chinese cuisine Soy milk Fecal incontinence One Piece minor characters Organic food Equine conformation

i found a young baby bird that fell out of a tree can i feed it mashed up worms or do the worms have to be regurgitated you feed it nothing if the baby bird has most of its feathers it is a fledgling baby birds fledge leave the nest before they can fly they need a few days on the ground hopping around climbing low branches and exercising their wings until they have strengthened them enough for flight the parent birds continue to feed and care for the fledglings until they are self sufficient if this is a fledgling leave it where you found it and leave once the parents do not see you around their baby they will return and care for it if it does not yet have a lot of feathers it is a nestling if so try to put the baby bird back in the nest do not worry about touching the baby the mother will not reject it birds do not have an acute sense of smell she will not detect your scent on the baby if you can not get the baby bird back in the nest you need to contact a licensed wildlife rehabilitator you can find one here http www tc umn edu devo contact htm please under no circumstances attempt to care for the bird yourself there is so much more to rehabilitation than keeping the animal alive until you think it is ready to be released you have to know not only what to feed the bird but how please do not attempt to give the bird any liquid by dropper baby birds can aspirate and die how much and how often you also have to know how to assess the birds general health and condition a baby bird kept in captivity must be taught to recognize and find the type of food it will eat in the wild if it is being hand fed it may not associate the bugs and berries and seeds in nature as being food it must also have the opportunity to exercise its wings a lot so it will be able to fly on or shortly after release when i volunteered at the avian rehabilitation center we kept the rehabilitating fledglings in a large walk in cage with lots of shelves and branches leading from one shelf to the other and down to the ground we would place different types of food in the cage for them as they were being weaned from the hand feeding formula we offered seed meal worms and chopped up fruit no fledgling was released until it was eating on its own had sufficient weight gain had all of its flight feathers in good condition had no sign of diarreah or nasal discharge had clear eyes and could fly at least a few feet in a straight line these are the reasons to get the bird to a licensed rehabilitator they have the training and the resources necessary to do all this in addition to having the permits to do it all legally all native migratory birds in the us are protected under the migratory bird treaty act and you must have the proper permits to have them even for a short time even for good reasons like saving them many other countries also have similar laws regarding their native species  Kakapo Breastfeeding Albatross Chicken Seabird Falconry Bird Capercaillie Bird migration Cat Pet skunk Mealy Parrot Domestic rabbit Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hunting Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 613 mitzvot Dinosaur Ant Peafowl Condor Bat H5N1 Platypus Guinea pig Species Red Squirrel Terri Schiavo Elephant Acorn Ivory-billed Woodpecker Livestock Fancy rat Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Insulin Kashrut Comanche Foie gras Dog American Black Bear Hedgehog Vegetarianism Tetrapod Bird flight Gliding Trapping Insect Orca Domesticated turkey Airport Mosquito Saruman Genetically modified food Peanut Dodo Animal testing Extinction Vermicompost Tasmanian Devil Peregrine Falcon Archaeopteryx Rock Dove Mountain Gorilla Gray Wolf Nurse Insurance Koala Snake Heinkel He 112 Life in the Freezer Trademark Infantilism Agriculture Pterosaur Fox hunting Canary Imprinting (psychology) Bee Kagu Hummingbird Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 Clark's Nutcracker House Sparrow Vomiting European Magpie Dog agility Weight training Childbirth Animal communication Baptism Professional wrestling attacks Shrimp farm Fish farming

questions about african grey parrots and if their a good pet for me i've been researching getting a parrot for awhile but i want to be sure i can cope with one african greys are my favourite but they seem high maintenence i will be at th form till pm in the day on average can they be left alone this long i would be sharing some of its care with other family members although i would be its main carer are they truly one person birds even if you get a young one and socialise it with different family members is biting a big problem don't mean gentle nipping are they very messy how often do they need to be cleaned out do they poop all the time are they easily potty trained to go in their cage any suggestions of other parrots types that are friendly and has anybody heard of or own a type called silver african greys not congos or timnehs i think you mean am to pm that's a long time but as long as you gvie her an hour or so after work school in the evening and maybe even let her be near the family when everyone eats dinner she'll feel included and that will make up for the day she spent in her cage lots of people do that and can keep their bird happy just provide lots fo different types of toys in a big roomy cage and she should be ok my dad's african grey was hand fed by my dad and even though he had picked my dad as his favorite bird slave he was very friendly with other people you just have to let them see other poeple and meet the family when they are young so they form positive bonds with lots of different people it's usually the amazons who are one persons birds more than the grey's a happy bird who is taught discipline at a young age will still bite but not often most of the time a bite is the human's fault anyways just leanr your bird's body language use discipline and set boundries that way you learn hwo to avoid being bitten as well as teaching the bird hwo to behave when they are young and play biting set boundries on where they can perch on you not on the head and probably not on the shoulder since they are a larger parrot and use discipline to help them learn how hard is too hard and what is ok bird poop every minutes on average some more some less they can be pretty messy though by pooping on the floor and furniture throwing food and water and also by chewing on wood furniture sometimes it's like wood furniture taste way better than any toy lol the cage needs to be cleaned at least once a week at least use dawn or even a vinegar solution both work well and are not harmful to your bird just rinse rinse rinse rinse rinse rinse potty training is difficult i think for any bird you have to start by when the poop say look everybody name here just made a whatever you want to call it for the command do this for awhile to the point where the leanr to associate that word with pooping then you can start trying to tell them to do whatever you called it on command it's hard to achieve but once you do you can live a cleaner life lol http www centralpets com animals birds parrots prt html this is the only other grey i know of other then the congo and the timneh but i have never heard of a silver one there are lots of other birds that friendly i love conures there are the larger conures like mitreds and patagonians that are just a little smaller than a grey but are smart and beautiful i am a little biased because i am in love with a conure and everyone i have met has been a sweet heart grey's are pretty needy so if this is your first bird i'd recommend looking into the conures they give you a parrot experience for a less expensive price and they aren't as likely to pluck they learn to entertain themselves during the day better thana grey could but if you are willing to do your research and maybe even volunteer at a bird rescue to get some experience then i would say a grey would be a good choice they jsut take dedication  Hamster Dog training Conure Fancy rat Guinea pig Mealy Parrot Social rule African Grey Parrot Pitaten Cat Japanese tea ceremony Breastfeeding Theory of conduct Dog Parrot Pet skunk RuneScape quests Textile manufacturing Drill bit Mattress Kodocha Strap-on dildo One Piece minor characters Egg (food) Upholstery Violin Ferret Milton H.

new parakeets mating the started mating about two days ago they only do it when i am in bed at night and they are so hard to train because they both get mood swings i was wondering about how long it takes them to lay the eggs and some facts about parakeet babies also i would like to know what are the chances she will lay fertile eggs oh wow yeah my birds did the same thing ok this is going to be alot of info my parakeets only mated when i wasnt around or in the morning or late at night once they do this the female will lay an egg in about days and if more are going to be laid they will be laid about every other day and yes the female will have mood swings after all the eggs have been laid it will take about days for the eggs to hatch if they are fertile assuming they have mated if they are not the female will not be sitting on them the chances she lays fertile eggs are pretty good if they have mated if u are planning to breed them it is best to have a nest box wood is the best but cardboard can be used as a substitute after the eggs have hatched try not to disturb the female or she may reject the eggs once the babies are old enough to be handled try and socialize them as much as u can then ur babies will be excellent birds and its fun to see what colors they get some problems are egg binding this is when the egg in the female is too soft and cannot be pushed out give them cuttle bones to prevent this lettuce is good for females also and some pet stores have some special food for nesting females with extra nutrients if the female however does get egg bound u can soak her butt in warm water to help if this does not help get to a vet immediately or it could be fatal to the bird i will have a web page for u too lok at  Chicken Kakapo Bird Platypus Leatherback Sea Turtle Ostrich Hamster Aphid Emu Seabird Capercaillie Dog Mattress Guinea pig Queen bee Pet skunk Tick Breastfeeding Nile crocodile Clownfish Fancy rat American lobster Salmon Octopus Albatross Spider Dinosaur Tuatara Musk Duck Species Bobwhite Quail Sexual reproduction Dragons (Pern) American Alligator Budgerigar Tarantula Minor Harry Potter Beasts Anopheles Flea Earthworm Beetle Polychrotidae Milk Cat Penguin American Robin Jute Coconut crab Bagworm moth In vitro fertilisation Gypsy moth Falconry Shark Kiwi Brolga Hedgehog Vegetarianism Ascariasis Hemp The chicken or the egg Osprey Giant Panda Red imported fire ant Jon Secada Tofu Kodocha Goldfish Infertility Great Bustard Cockroach Gerald Durrell Condor Grunion 2000 Australian Grand Prix Malleefowl Eggerland series Comanche Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Mallard Domestic rabbit Dairy Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Hera Bee Rose-ringed Parakeet Fibonacci number Bird migration House Mouse Paper wasp

correction to my first question she is a cockatiel pulling feathers parrot feather plucking is a condition in which your pet chews or plucks its own feathers to the point of obsession some parrots pluck from one small area such as on their leg others pluck their feathers from all over despite popular opinions to the contrary this is not a disease there are several possible causes for this to occur some of the causes are medical while others are not to stop parrot feather plucking you have to isolate the causes boredom nervousness insecurity over crowded housing excessive courtship behavior inadequate bathing facilities breed predisposition itchy bird syndrome is distinguished by the way your bird acts instead of casually preening and plucking signs of this are when your bird acts agitated and is constantly rubbing itself against the perch or the bars on the cage to stop parrot feather plucking you need to isolate what is actually happening otherwise you will not know where to begin parrot feather plucking can start off slow and escalate as time moves forward the best place to start is a visit to the vet to rule out any medical mite condition  Parrot Domestic rabbit Chicken Bird Equine conformation Cockatiel Mealy Parrot Haloperidol Guinea pig Hamster Fancy rat Traumatic brain injury Animal testing Dog Coeliac disease Peafowl H5N1 Budgerigar Hypoglycemia Kakapo John Cage RuneScape quests Moult Cockatoo Animal communication Bird flight Obsessive-compulsive disorder African Grey Parrot Dinosaur Schizophrenia Garfield Diseases of the honeybee Autism Species Sleep Diabetes mellitus Kea Sesame Street Chronic fatigue syndrome Cardiac arrhythmia Traumatic incident reduction Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Ferret Cephalic disorder Autoimmune diseases Double bass Monk Parakeet Conure Pasadena, California Charge (heraldry) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Falconry Tick Cocaine Stomach cancer Polycystic ovary syndrome Dead Parrot Cancer Dog training Parkinson's disease Allergy Decompression sickness Ostrich Rape Addiction Masturbation Domesticated turkey Capercaillie Psittacosis Asthma AIDS reappraisal Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Honeybee Fibromyalgia Domestic goat Piccolo Junior Saga Turner syndrome Alcoholism Multiple sclerosis String instrument Psychosis Elephant Dog agility Hearing impairment Disease Scarlet Macaw Psoriasis Guqin Vitamin C Childbirth Rabies Beard Tuberculosis Free will Asperger syndrome Swingout Drug abuse Paget's disease of bone

why is my bird biting all his feathers off he is always biting at himself and now he only has the soft gray underfeathers left he is a and year old african gray parrot hi many factors to consider here so i will name them and you can look into what you think medical including diet and also psyhcological mites hard to determine easy to treat dry iritated skin not getting enough light consider buying a uv light stress new house move maybe or new cage new surrondings can also be caused by partners other ppl arguing which affects the bird not getting enough attention left alone alot boredom not enough toys in cage and out of cage to stimulate it they are clever birds and constantly need different things to play with do bad diet not getting enough fresh fruit and veg being fed a poor seed diet not getting enough vitamine a and calcium the list is endless parrots with feather plucking that are left un treated could start to self mutalate them self so it is very important you try to find the route of the problem look back and find out when it started and what had changed at the time if you have enough money you should take your grey to an avian vet in attempting to investigate a feather plucking problem one has to be able to recognise the normal from the abnormal and to eliminate all other possible causes of feather disease this will require detailed questioning of the owner clinical history as to the background of the bird where it came from where it is kept how it is fed when the problem started how is the problem manifest are other birds involved etc etc etc examination of the environment is important the presence of parasites or irritants may be detected plus one can get a general impression of the bird's lifestyle the bird will then need a thorough examination probably linked to laboratory tests such as blood samples to assess liver and kidney function hormone levels or to check for infectious agents such as psittacine beak and feather disease pbfd it may be necessary to examine feather samples or skin biopsies for the presence of bacteria viruses fungi or parasites have a look at the parrot sociecty website which should help you alot with there feather plucking article well worth a read http www theparrotsocietyuk org genarticle shtml good luck  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Medicine Stomach cancer Hypoglycemia Acne Coeliac disease Fancy rat Multiple sclerosis Chronic fatigue syndrome Guinea pig Hamster Cirrhosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Nutrition Chicken AIDS Colorectal cancer Psoriasis Vitamin C Autism Medical analysis of circumcision Tocopherol Canary Lupus erythematosus Insulin Crohn's disease Urinary incontinence Malignant melanoma Alzheimer's disease Asthma Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Eczema Clinical depression Rocky Mountain spotted fever Domestic rabbit Stroke Atherosclerosis Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Rheumatoid arthritis Genetically modified food Halitosis Breastfeeding Virus Mealy Parrot HIV test Alcoholism Osteoporosis Schizophrenia Diseases of the honeybee Obstetrics Endocrinology Gastroesophageal reflux disease Bird Anemia Turner syndrome Ultraviolet Fibromyalgia Veganism Vomiting Glycogen storage disease type I Infectious disease Ferret Vegetarianism Kakapo IgA nephropathy Foodborne illness Rabies Fecal incontinence Dieting Growth hormone deficiency Vitamin D Schistosomiasis Biology Leptospirosis Ulcerative colitis Dinosaur Cephalic disorder Cytomegalovirus African Grey Parrot Carbon dioxide Allergy Controversies in autism Menstrual cycle Tlingit Dietary fiber Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS

someone please help me i found eggs by my house a few weeks ago and im trying to hatch them i wrapped them up in a blanket and left them alone for about weeks now one of them is dead and one of them has gray patches all over it please help me ps i found them in a nest if you live in the us and you removed two eggs from a nest what you did was not only wrong it was illegal all native migratory birds in the us are protected by federal law under the migratory bird treaty act you can not capture a protected bird disturb its nest take its eggs or even possess one of its feathers http www npwrc usgs gov about faqs birds feathers htm states anyone desiring to possess migratory birds or their parts or products should be aware that all of these are covered under the migratory bird treaty act u s c which implements a series of international treaties designed to protect migratory birds some key provisions of the act are worth keeping in mind wording of the act makes it very clear that most actions that result in taking or possession of a protected species or its parts or products is a violation of the act specifically the act states unless and except as permitted by regulations it shall be unlawful at any time by any means or in any manner to pursue hunt take capture kill possess offer for sale sell purchase import any migratory bird any part nest or eggs of any such bird it is a strict liability law meaning that there is no requirement for law enforcement agencies to prove intent to violate the law that is if you are found in possession of a protected species or its parts or products you are automatically in violation of the law the provisions of the act are nearly absolute except as permitted by regulations is the only exception some examples of permitted activities that do not violate the law are legal hunting of specific game birds legitimate research activities display in licensed zoological gardens and bird banding under an appropriate permit the act covers the great majority of all native birds found in the u s many of the species not covered by the act are covered by the endangered species act other federal laws or state laws many of which are as stringent as the migratory bird treaty act in the lower states all species except the house sparrow feral pigeon common starling and non migratory game birds like pheasants gray partridge and sage grouse are protected penalties upon conviction can be severe even if a sympathetic jury finds that you meant no harm in trying to rear an abandoned nestling or in picking a hawk feather legal defense costs are clearly not worth the risk other countries have similar laws to protect their native wildlife but even if it were not illegal why would you take the eggs knowing that you did not have the proper knowledge to hatch them and if you had hatched them how did you think you were going to raise the babies leave animals and their nests eggs babies alone  Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bird Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 Freedom of speech Plame affair Appeal Trademark Kakapo Treaty Controlled Substances Act Contract Introduced species Child pornography House Sparrow Falconry Constitution of Ireland Albatross Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Endangered Species Act Seabird Capercaillie Gun politics Copyright Conspiracy Fox hunting Environmental Protection Agency Peregrine Falcon Due process Fair use Insurance Slander and libel Convention on Psychotropic Substances Consensual crime Arguments for and against drug prohibition Estoppel Australian constitutional law Article One of the United States Constitution Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Tax Gun politics in the United States USA PATRIOT Act Chicken Spyware Copy protection Warez Classified information United States Constitution Fauna of Australia Cat Copyleft Copyright law of the United Kingdom Copyright infringement of software Corporation Kashrut Murder Peafowl Unlawful combatant Free trade Equal Protection Clause Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Civil rights Food and Drug Administration Constitution Game (food) American individualist anarchism Illegal immigration Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Theory of conduct Speed limit Rape Prohibition Juris Doctor Gray Wolf Capitalism International Criminal Court Lawrence v.

i have birds and all of them are plucking their feathers help why are all of them plucking their feathers stress from me changing their water and food or help im scared mites omg what kind of thing you said that i should buy at pet store are mites life threatening to birds my birds are australian zebra finches i brought them home days ago and i love them so much i change water and food everyday i talk to them is that okay lol they're right by my window um what else lol thank you guys for helping cek did anyone ever tell you that those mite protectors are toxic and dangerous to a bird people think they just have to have one in their cage to protect their birds but what you are doing is poisoning them mite protectors omit a toxic fume that the birds are breathing in and after a year or so it will damage the organs and respiratory track of the bird and will prove fatal birds that live in a clean environment will not get mites but if you think that your birds may have mites it is best to contact an avian vet for advise feather loss can be roughly divided into catagories spontaneous without plucking vs self induced plucking and pathologic medical vs behavioral it is usually simple to differentiate between spontaneous feather loss and plucking through evaluation of a detailed history and physical examination molting should be considered normal if there are new feathers seen and no visible bare patches or exposed down feathers feather loss can be caused by a cagemate often noted on the back of the head as a result of over preening once molting and cagemate trauma have been ruled out the bird is evaluated for plucking or poor feather growth sapphyre certified avian specialist http www borrowed rainbow com http groups yahoo com group borrowedrainbowaviary  Canary Guinea pig Moult Hamster Chicken Lung Biology Cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dinosaur Multiple sclerosis Carbon dioxide Hypoglycemia Pneumonia H5N1 Domestic rabbit RuneScape quests Pesticide Asthma Medicine Decompression sickness 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Autism Thermoregulation Avian influenza Spider Arthropod Hydrogen sulfide Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Post-traumatic stress disorder Hydrogen peroxide Abortion Stroke Fauna of Australia Coconut crab Dog agility Folic acid Gypsy moth Acute respiratory distress syndrome Extinction Air pollution Animal Traumatic incident reduction Stomach cancer Prostate cancer Organic food Sleep Tobacco smoking Color Reptile Stuttering Influenza Parkinson's disease Dog Multiple chemical sensitivity Honeybee Child sexuality Narcotic Insurance Glacier First aid Vitamin C Ultraviolet Cephalic disorder Childbirth Epilepsy Hearing impairment Medical record House dust mite Irreducible complexity Thimerosal Terri Schiavo Vomiting Tuberculosis Anxiety Miscarriage Cyanide Urinary incontinence Biodiversity Scabies Kundalini Tiberium Mange Puberty Tooth enamel Domesticated turkey Death Aphasia Animal rights Autopsy Social psychology Botulism

are ionized air purifiers safe for my birds i have noticed that when i put my air purifier on for long periods of use with the ionizer on in the same room where my birds are my bird starts to act strange he suddenly has a night fright type reactions and also chirps differently runs in a circle on the floor like in a panic or something he is a year old lovebird and have never seen him react like this before until i got a new air purifier called sharp plasmacluster ionizer my question is is my bird being affected by this air cleaner somehow hi patrj by what you describe your love bird is indeed been affected by the ionizer air cleaner it may not the ionizer that is causing any harm to your pet but he is reacting to some thing strange that bothers him your best bet to try to identify what is causing him distress is to analise his reaction during the day when he is distracted with his daily routine and at night when he is looking at the ceiling trying to count the sheep before he goes to sleep you need to understand the your year old lovebird is a senior citizen so try to cover his cage at night and than start the ionizer if the ionizer has any kind a blue or red light try to tape that with black electrical tape so the reflection of light does not show and scares your feathered friend to death you will see how the ionizer works as the air feels fresher and clean when you breath in and also the amount of white dust caused by your birds feather dust will be reduced to almost nothing hope this has helped you understand why your pet is scared and i commend you by trying to make it's life more enjoyable best to you and keep the faith the canaryman  Mattress Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Ionizing radiation Book of Isaiah Hamster Air purifier Vacuum Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Color Mass spectrometry Nuclear explosion Milton H.

what is the best place to keep a parrot's cage i have a parrot and i have a problem with him he remains quiet in my room but when i bring its cage outside he starts to be more active and makes different sounds my cage also has shade so where should i keep it my parrots also love to be outside but i do not keep them in a cage their wings are clipped so they can be on my shoulder or on a t stand if i have them on a stand they have some shade and some sunlight so if can move around if they get too hot since being outside is natural to them it doe make them have a change in behavior because they are enjoying the fresh air and sunlight now when you do have them outside just be careful about wild bird droppings since domesticated can catch wild bird's illness'es don't keep your bird in direct sunlight half shade and sun will give the bird the choice to where it wants to sit and not get over heated parrots are social animals and they like to be where they can see family members they also love to have their cage in front of a window so they can see what is going on outside the benefits of being in front of a window is to also be able to get some sunlight which is import to their overall health a bird that sits in a dark room or poorly lit room will develop feathers problems and have a higher chance of becoming depressed sapphyre certified avian specialist http www borrowed rainbow com http groups yahoo com group borrowedrainbowaviary  Mealy Parrot Bird Chicken Solar power Hamster Guinea pig Fancy rat H5N1 Equine conformation John Cage Thermoregulation Ferret Lighting Aerial (dance move) Kakapo Fan (implement) Chinchilla Rainbow Horse Canary Professional wrestling throws Renewable energy Dinosaur Sun Domestic rabbit Sento Clinical depression Upholstery Trapping Parrot RuneScape quests Light Pok__mon Abilities Jon Secada The Time Machine Pysanka Scarlet Macaw Falconry Sleep Daylight saving time Extinction Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Psittaciformes Feral cat Professional wrestling holds Reptile Sauna Joy Division (band) Solar variation Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Suplex Japanese tea ceremony Chocolate Autonomous building Swimming Health insurance Weather lore Delta Goodrem Lung Exotic pet Fire fighting RuneScape Random Events Shade Mercury Atlas 6 Animal Divorce Simone Weil HVAC Dead Parrot Heat index Kea The Dalek Invasion of Earth Domesticated turkey Psychiatry Behavioral ecology Light-emitting diode Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine Euphemism Energy development African Grey Parrot Shaggy dog story Roxette The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Comet Tetrapod Internal ballistics Green tea Conure Aladdin (1992 film) Comparative psychology Vitamin D Animal cognition Wind power Traumatic brain injury

my parrot masturbates does anyone else's yeah my parrot rubs his rear against a branch like perch i have in the cage he does it nonstop and im starting to think something is wrong with him i know his genitalia are located under that wing so im just wondering basically if anyone else has a horny bird thanks for the answers so far but i dont think its mites or anything like that when he does it he sticks his tail straight up in the air and makes the most ridiculous noise and moves himself slowly up and down hes done similar things when i was petting his tail and lower body so i highly doubt its anything other than for pleasure i just dont know if its normal yeah he must have an overactive sexdrive he does it literally for hours on end he ll keep going for maybe minutes then rest for a bit get some water get some food then go back to it im considering getting him a female i have heard of parrots doing this to certain toys they like or their owner's arm and they are certainly getting it on it could be that or might it be at all possible that your bird has mites or worms or something else worm it at nighttime shine a torch in the cage and see if there are tiny red bugs running from the light mites it could be that he's humping the perch or that it may be something else edit just read your additional notes sounds like a horny bird lol touching his back and tail can be seen as sexual to him so can touching the vent area and beak wrestling it's not something i would neccasarily reccomend though because sometimes birds that do that can turn very aggressive towards anyone else and be possessive of you or possibly even harming yourself but yes it is pretty normal  Chicken Fancy rat Mealy Parrot Cat Bird African Grey Parrot Equine conformation Professional wrestling match types Salad Fingers Human sexual behavior Canary Sexual dimorphism Masturbation Animal communication Strap-on dildo Dog agility Capercaillie Professional wrestling throws Fauna of Australia Hamster John Cage Unreal Treehouse of Horror V Mitsubishi 3000GT Wheel of Fortune Dead Parrot Platypus M16 (rifle) Parrot The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Skateboarding trick Kakapo 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Tag Ferret Professional wrestling attacks Characters of Naruto Sesshomaru 2000 Australian Grand Prix Blood on the Tracks Pet skunk Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Tetrapod Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Puberty P-38 Lightning Sant Thakar Singh Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an European Nightjar Gray Wolf Snooker The Legend of Zelda series enemies Paraphilia The Shining (film) Penis Gesture Oral sex Gramophone record Creatures in Bionicle Sea-Monkey Sinfest 24 Hours of Le Mans Leopard Aerial (dance move) Animal Chinchilla Biological pest control Social rule Ancient Macedonian language RuneScape quests Mosquito Condom Naruto jutsu Bladderwort Laserdisc Wood carving Internal ballistics Domestic rabbit Toilet humour Devil Fruit Child sexuality Snake Joke Falconry Nile crocodile Water polo Mario Saturday Night Live Mouse (computing) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Octopus Simone Weil Swingout House of M Garfield

indian ringneck care my mom just got an indian ringneck today and didn't do any research before hand so my question to everyone is what are the basics that we need to know i've been reading that you need to give them pellets instead of seeds but what kind of pellets do they need any special vitamins and what size cage is best it came with a cage but i'm afraid it might be too small what is the best way to help tame them down and is there any information at all about the care of this bird that anyone can give me i know it was irresponsible of her to get this bird without doing her research i'm just trying to do damage control now and figure out how to take care of it properly the pet store said it is years old and it is a female not very tame here are some pics http www flickr com photos little love sets thanks everyone you're right that it was wrong but i am glad you are trying to make it right that's a good first step pellets there are lots of good brands but zupreem is a very popular and easy to find but do buy some seed to mix in at first i would do at least a mix because of the fact the bird was in a petstore and was probably on an all seed diet http www birdcompanions com indianringnecksfaqs htm a cage at least x x since they are a medium parrot they need lots of space to get good excersice it actually looks like the smaller african ringeck but it could be that the bird is a younger bird from teh pics i would get a new cage and alos more toys and a couple different sized and textured perches right now let her rest and try and destress she's probably not very socialized and therefore even more stressed out then a young socialized parrot give her space and probably leave her in a dim room for an hour or so and then check on her and offer a treat try and get her used to you too realize she may nto seem tame cause of how nervous she is but to help her you'll have to give her space and tlak calmly to her as well as moving slowly around her cage so as not to spook her also after a couple days i would either offer her a dish full of lukewarm or cool water to bathe in or perhaps buy a mister at the dollar store fill it with water and mist her really good she probably hasn't bathed in forever i'd go get a book on ringnecks and leanr even mroe on care i'd find an avian vet in your area and get her checked out also since petstores usually don't keep up on those types of things for a couple days put a cuttle bone in her cage too since she has poor diet she could use the extra minerals for now until her diet is mostly pellets along with fruits and veggies i hope you can turn this situation around best of luck  Hamster Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Fancy rat Mealy Parrot Canary Garfield Chicken Bird Prostate cancer Social rule Equine conformation Fecal incontinence Ferret XML Pet skunk Sento Shaggy dog story Tocopherol Falconry Infantilism Ramen RuneScape quests Elephant Blood (computer game) Chinchilla Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Japanese tea ceremony Hash table The Apprentice 2 Futurama (TV series - season 2) Urinary incontinence Strap-on dildo Patricia Ford Fugu Brewery CPU cache Vegetarianism Domain Name System Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma John Cage Chronic fatigue syndrome Floppy disk Theory of conduct Veganism Breastfeeding RISC Customs and etiquette of Japan Bread Care Bears Tofu Pikmin Dog Mattress Folic acid Slot machine 613 mitzvot Stomach cancer Hedgehog Dog training Days of our Lives The Time Machine Organic food Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chile pepper Egg (food) StarCraft: Uprising Tooth Anorexia nervosa 2005 Kashmir earthquake Cuisine of Brazil Soap Ice cream Upholstery Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Dead Parrot Animal rights Doom engine Sea-Monkey Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Solar power Trapping Little Britain Hamburger EastEnders Neopets Debugging Childbirth GunZ The Duel Cat Betting (poker) Glossary of partner dance terms Milk

how do i get my green cheeked connor to stop biting hi i have a year old green cheeked conure myself i even bred her when she hit she started getting nippy and going for my face she'd attack my partner as was a right terror screaching as she was biting gee why is it they know how to bite so they dont break the skin but it hurts like hell i found by holding her when she was biting with fingers either side of her beak would stop her being sturn and telling her no yes she'd try to take chunks out of me but i wouldnt re act the more she done it the longer i'd hold her with my fingers either side of her beak only when she stopped would i stop during this time i would talk to her carmly even if she was biting me raising your voice or reacting to them biting gives them more insentive to carry on doing it because to them it will become a game not just that but they try to be the boss they try to rule you by doing this you have to just ignore the bad behaviour and stay focused you be the boss you dont want him her to bite you make them know it they give up in end as they aint getting a reaction from you also another thing people do which i never needed to do is as soon as they bite stick them in the cage ignore them leave it ten minutes then go back and try again and keep repeating the process also one thing to consider is not to let him her on your shoulder while trying to stop the biting as they then see you as an equal instead of the dominant one good luck  Social rule 2000 Australian Grand Prix Blood (computer game) Aerial (dance move) Pok__mon Live!

handling gloves while i don't promote using gloves to protect hands against birds biting it is acceptable for some things i'm working with a new macaw and he bites i'm not worried about cuts slashes or anything like that it's the shear pressure on my forearm and fingers when he grabs them i teach and play violin so i kind of need my fingers and arms in perfect working order what are the best handling gloves they need to protect more against the pressure of the bite than the sharpness of the beak i was thinking that maybe kevlar would be good but i also kind of liked a pair of gloves on petsolutions com which would be better leather and pigskin gloves or kevlar the reason i don't know much about gloves is because i've never had to use them before i've just taken all the abuse from the birds but this macaw is determined to amputate my arm i know that gloves are usually a no no because they can scare the bird but i figured out how to not scare the bird i found some black kevlar sleeves so that snicker can't puncture or tear my arm and i can hide the sleeves under a shirt so the bird never sees them i'm just not putting my fingers near the cage until snicker stops trying to take off my arm have you tried kevlar i know that many years ago i wrote an article on a kevlar horse blanket that users swore was indestructable owners i interviewed said that their horses could not bite it rip it tear it on barb wire fencing or damage it in any way if kevlar horse blankets could withstand the force of a horse bite i imagine a kevlar glove could withstand the pressure of a macaw beak edit if you are undecided can you afford a pair of each see which ones work best for you or get a pair of one or the other and if they don't work out see if you can get a refund and buy the other type and try them i can't recommend any particular type from personal experience as i am one of those weird people that just can not work with gloves on no matter what type i get or how well they fit i can not properly feel what i am handling and i get frustrated and take them off after just a few minutes  Fencing RuneScape quests Milton H.

can birds eat ice cream i have a grey cheek parakeet and ive heard that they like ice cream im scared to give it ice cream becuase i think i might kill it i just wanna know can birds enjoy that special cold treat i agree with what seems to be the overwhelming thought here in the fact that it isn't a good idea birds don't have the ability to properly process dairy and while a little dairy such as milk can be alright you have to consider ice cream has other things in it it usually has sugar that isn't good for them and depending on the flavor some can be potentially toxic so i would avoid it there are some human foods that are alright but i would stay clear of most treat foods that we eat especially with a parakeet since their systems would only require a very small toxin to kill them due to their size  Ice cream Milk Dairy Kashrut Tofu Dairy product Kosher foods Cream (food) Tea Veganism Milkshake Food Pasteurization Foodborne illness Fecal incontinence Food preservation Organic food Bird Nutrition Coffee Theory of conduct Meat analogue The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Vegetarianism Cuisine of the Philippines Cuisine of Denmark Hamster Patrick Star Lactose intolerance Sewage treatment Dieting Carbon dioxide Japanese cuisine Organic farming Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Vitamin D Dairy Queen Bob and George Soup Breakfast Healthy eating Butter Tooth Oreo New Zealand English Crohn's disease Heath bar Stomach cancer Livestock Rice pudding Breastfeeding Insulin Cat Diarrhea Mango Yoghurt Unclean animals Fugu Atkins Nutritional Approach Potato Escherichia coli O157:H7 Spider Cancer Cheesecake Phoebe Buffay's songs Vanilla Jewish cuisine Kangaroo Trans fat Debugging Vegetarian cuisine Little Britain Plutonium Codename: Kids Next Door Commodity markets Confectionery Gelato Cake Goodness and value theory Sour cream Beatrice Foods Brown Bear Espresso Hypoglycemia Omega-3 fatty acid Alcohol fuel Property (ownership right) Raw food diet Vitamin C Hedgehog Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Acne The Apprentice 2 Tlingit Mushroom hunting Raw milk

parakeet grit hi i have had my two parakeets for quite some time now and a friend of mine bought grit for hers can someone tell me what this is for and how you would use it if im correct you just put it in the seed bowl or on the floor of the cage and it helps with digestion but do they actually eat it simple answer is no they do not need it it isnt used for parakeets or parrots althou from somewhere along time ago someone must have decided it was and thrus spreading the word but infact giving a parakeet grit can sometimes prove fatal any bird that hulls it's seed does not require grit birds such as pigeons or doves that eat grain whole need grit to help grind up the hulls i sugest you tell your friend to remove the grit imediatly parakeets will eat it despite and often this will build up in the crop causing impacted crop which requires sugery to fix also when a parakeet is stressed or sick and theres grit in the cage they will often eat the whole lot and die a small amount at the end of the week is fine but its not necessary hope this helps  Bird Parrot Hamster Famine Sharpening stone Sorghum Monk Parakeet Carolina Parakeet Guinea pig Conure Livestock Fancy rat Mourning Dove RuneScape quests Flax Alexandrine Parakeet Dodo Hemp Knife Maize Earthworm Peanut Domestic rabbit Extinct birds Jewish cuisine Rose-ringed Parakeet Acorn Stomach cancer Chicken Amateur telescope making Oyster Cereal E85 613 mitzvot Vegetarianism Dove Trapping Newton's Parakeet Nutrition Red-masked Parakeet Grits Flour Budgerigar Genetic engineering Capercaillie Babylonian law Microeconomics Combine harvester Vomiting Plum-headed Parakeet Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Barley Quinoa Breakfast DDT Rice Apple Alcoholic beverage Green Revolution Ashton-Tate Seismic retrofit Weed control Mealy Parrot Vitamin C Allan Octavian Hume Pet Equine conformation Chocolate Slashdot trolling phenomena Diarrhea Opportunity rover Psittaciformes Ferret Gristmill White-winged Dove Japanese tea ceremony Bread Spanish verbs YuYu Hakusho Potato Ron Weasley Pikmin Fruit Extreme Programming Beetle Crop circle Genetically modified food Pet store Sibley-Monroe checklist 4 Cuisine of the Southern United States Cat Insulin Jumpstart 3rd Grade RuneScape skills John Cage Cannabis cultivation

button quail help i have a pair of button quail and have had them for or months at first they were really skiddish and whenever someone came in the room they'd run in their house now they have adapted well and dont get so scared when someone enters the room but they are not tame i gave up on trying to tame them a long time ago my problem now is that they dont have any eggs they hade one a long time ago after that not one egg has been seen what can i do to encourage them to lay eggs i am sure they are mail and female they get about hours of direct sunlight through glass this is probably not enough huh i read that they need hours of sun to lay eggs is this hours of direct sun rays or just hours of lighting thanks for your assistance whoever has the most in depth responce gets best answer the male is normal colored blackish blue with carcoal grey wings and dark dusty red underside the female is all white i am sure that the white one is a female because the blue one is a male for sue he has a white bib under his mouth thats proof isnt it and i saw an egg they live in a home made cage made from an up side down desk and some wire mesh they seem happy but dont lay eggs they always sleep and rest right next to eachother like together their cage is progagly sqaure feet or more layerd with cedar shavings i give them meal worms a giant sand box finch seeds and millet spray it's hours of lighting it doesn't need to be direct sunlight and actually you wouldn't want it to be because they'd probably overheat and die are they indoor birds or outdoor birds there isn't much incentive to reproduce if there's only feet of room to begin with are you entirely sure they're male and female do you have any pictures what color variety are they with normals and really most varieties besides the pale colors it's pretty easy to distinguish the two are they related if they are whatever you do don't breed them and if they are this could be part of the reason they're not readily humping make sure that whatever enclosure you have them in has lots and lots of cover when i had button quail i bought a whole assortment of fake real potted plants to put in the pen a friend's father constructed a coop of sorts for all of them for them to seek shelter under if the bottom of the enclosure is solid make sure you have it covered with mulch or something similar if it's wire bottomed you need to put something inside that has mulch bedding of some sort i found that with mine they would most often lay their eggs in a small depression scooped out by the female inside of a small cat crate i'd placed inside with shavings on the inside of it the only thing was my birds were very young and not really 'breeding ' they were just laying as a product of being hens so they would sometimes also just lay a random egg here and there it could be that your birds are just too young in combination with not being exposed to proper conditions suitable for breeding also make sure they have a constant supply of fresh food and water not just pellet food offer them vegetables mealworms etc etc the more variety in their diet the healthier they'll be the more willing they'll be to try to bring more birds into the environment  Chicken Domestic rabbit Fancy rat RuneScape quests Egg (food) Poker jargon Cat Solar power Mattress Livestock Coffee Trapping Mealy Parrot Shark Platypus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Canary Kakapo Vermicompost Mouse (computing) Theory of conduct Minor Harry Potter Beasts Professional wrestling match types Tea Pet skunk Earthworm Ferret Seabird Cannabis cultivation Sea-Monkey Dog Pysanka Equine conformation Discus (fish) Aquarium Gypsy moth Christmas tree Roman eating and drinking Fish farming Spider Japanese cuisine Lighting FoxTrot The Time Machine Color Albatross Plastic Anopheles Hemp Vegetarianism Diseases of the honeybee Mulch Weed control Energy development Mid-levels Egg (biology) Ostrich Bread Brewery Pansy Domestication Cantonese cuisine Biological pest control Hamburger Veganism Sears Holdings Corporation Honeybee Opportunity rover Carnivorous plant Ron and Fez Chlorophyta Tofu Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Anchor Kitchen Salmon Shen Gong Wu Tetrapod The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Sento Sun Domestic AC power plugs and sockets EastEnders Futurama (TV series - season 5) Goldfish Domesticated turkey Sunlight Geology of the Grand Canyon area Houseplant

my lovebird doesn't trust me im getting frustrated i talk to my lovebird mango everyday for mins he'll let me sing him to sleep or whatever but i still cant touch him with my fingers he likes to sit at the top of his cage at night and i always go up to him to say good night and he will let me kiss his stomach only through the cage but when hes outside his cage he bites really hard he bites inside his cage to but thats only when he sees my finger i dont understand if he trusts me or not did you buy your bird handfed or wild if it is comfortable enough to bite you instead of running away i'm going to assume it was handfed but whoever did it did not do it with care is it biting you just because you have your hand inside the cage or because you are trying to grab it by the way lovebirds that bite all the time are more likely to be females than males anyways if you are trying to grab it touch it hold it and it is biting you it is because the bird does not trust you don't keep doing it because if you do the bird will never trust you if it is biting you simply because you have your hand inside the cage than your bird is a territorial female who doesn't like her space being invaded some ways to solve this problem are to buy a bigger cage so she doesn't feel like she has a nest to be protecting and to rearrange all her toys food bowls etc once a week how do you get your bird outside the cage do you take her out forcibly if your bird isn't comfortable coming outside by herself then you shouldn't force it unfortunately most people will tell you that if you buy a lovebird that was not tamed with care as a baby it is very hard to socialize the bird it is possible to try here is what you should do buy a bag of millet from a pet store lovebird's are absolutely addicted to millet leave little snippets of millet in her pet food for a few days so she knows it tastes good after a few days stop giving her millet if you feed her a bird seed mix instead of pellet take all of the sunflower seeds out of her food when you feed her this is so she doesn't have any treats in her regular feed start offering her millet and sunflower seeds through the cage bars if she seems scared don't approach her sit very still and let her come to you this builds trust as she will realize you aren't going to attack her or make any sudden scary movements once she is comfortable being fed through the bars start putting millet and sunflower seeds in the palm of your hand put your hand inside the cage and wait for the bird to come to you again never approach the bird wait for the bird to come to you this can take upwards of minutes but patience is the only way to tame a lovebird that does not trust you after she is comfortable with the above you should start teaching her to step up on your hand only let her have the millet if she is willing to come to you and step onto your hands start using millet to bait her into coming outside her cage your bird needs to know that going outside of her home is her choice not yours hold the millet outside her open cage door and let her come outside herself don't ever get too excited when doing any of the above steps because your excitement will scare the bird more than anything keep this in mind especially when you let the bird outside of its cage birds are usually a little scared outside of their homes and if you start acting too excited and playful she will be scared of you too you need to be calm and let her get familiar with her surroundings those are my tips for training a wild lovebird in the future when you buy a lovebird you need to make sure it is a well tamed pet that was raised by someone that paid attention to the bird lovebirds that are good for the home are ones that are already very friendly in the pet store and look for human attention good luck with this for both yours and the bird's sake if this doesn't work out i would really consider getting your lovebird a friend lovebirds need attention whether it is from humans or other lovebirds cranky lovebirds easily become depressed on their own and will become even crankier as a result  Shaggy dog story Dog training RuneScape quests Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Salad Fingers Kodocha Domestic rabbit Chicken Fancy rat Guinea pig Aerial (dance move) Milton H.

my bird gus gus i have a year old cockateil named gus gus and he is not very friendly i have had him for about months now and i got him from my mom she had him for about months and she got him from her friends who didn't really spend time with him my mom got him out and talked to him alot and my hubby and i have tons of interaction with him and talk to him and get him out like everyday we clipped his flight wings but when we go to get him out of his cange he bites us and he will not let us touch him to pet him when we try to pet him he flies off and i am afraid he will hurt himself i don't know why he is so afraid he will not sit on our finger what can i do to get him to trust us and overcome his fears and to be nicer to us and stop biting us please help you just have to be patient start by putting your hands on his cage not in it but not above him they dont like to be towered above after he gets used to you having your hand on his cage place it in nhis age but not near him eventually he will not be as afraid of your hand then you can try to gently pet him on his tummy or beak he may try to bite but they sometimes do this to test how sturdy and trusty your hand is or just to taste your fingers you can try to grab him gently and hold him out of the cage hold on to him firmly but gently and talk to him in a soothing voice do not raise your voice at him if he bites beucase birds learn to do things the more they get a reaction from you so if y ou yell he will learn this gets your attention and keep repeating the action when you take him back to his cage place him on top of the cage instead of in it and maybe close the doors so he feels he can be outside the cage safely just remember they take lots of attention and noise and toys they are very territorial so dont be suprised when he thinks of his cage as his home and doesnt want you in it just keep doing what you are doing and dont give up on him d  Milton H.

can lovebirds eat parakeet food i was wondering lovebirds can eat parakeet food if that's what you consider but parakeet food won't give your lovebirds enough nutrients and proteins obviosely parakeet food is made specially for parakeets and food for lovebirds are specially made for lovebirds the same rule goes onto cats and dogs if a cat eats dog food in general chances are that cat won't get its daily vitamins because dog food doesn't contain taurine in which dogs can make their own cats need taurine in their bodies and there can be some vitamins that your lovebird might need if it eats parakeet food  Vitamin Cat Essential amino acid Guinea pig Cat food Vitamin C Nutrition Dieting Domestic rabbit Retinol Taurine Raw food diet Tocopherol Folic acid Genetically modified food Pet skunk Veganism Healthy eating Coprophagia Malnutrition Coeliac disease The Birds (film) Cyanocobalamin Food Milk Vitamin D Stomach cancer Vegetarianism Taboo food and drink Liver Carnivore Egg (food) Sibley-Monroe checklist 4 Amino acid Hamster Calorie Dog Vegetarian nutrition Kodocha Dog food Human skin color Fecal incontinence Kitten Nutrient Garfield Soybean Cuttlefish Fruitarianism Antioxidant Peanut butter Ferret CatDog Golden rice Food preservation Tooth enamel Fancy rat Flavonoid Sauerkraut Binge eating disorder Anorexia nervosa Anemia Bodybuilding Melanin Invader Zim Pig Diarrhea Trailer Park Boys Omega-3 fatty acid Vitamin K Dietary fiber Pet Cholesterol Vomiting Insulin Paget's disease of bone Hedgehog Genetic engineering Peanut Extinct birds Chocolate Hunting Livestock Salmon Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Antarctic krill Maine Coon Kakapo Newton's Parakeet Devil Fruit Cirrhosis Marmite Lovebird Potato Maka dai dai shogi Organic food Lisa the Vegetarian Natt__ Rice Conure

i think my baby chicken may have broken its leg how can i tell what's wrong and what to do everything seems to be fine with it its right leg is what seems to hurt it peeps very loudly when i try to put it down the little chick won't stand and just sits there with its eyes closed trying to sleep i had to carry it over to the water and dip its beak in to make it drink while the others were already up and running around oh yah and they are about days old don't know if that helps yes your bird sounds like he has a broken leg if you want to give him a chance to live separate him from the other chicks they are just going to be stepping on him and most likely pecking at him to put him in a small cage that prevents him from moving much keep him at the proper temperature put some sugar into his water to give him a boost wet down his chick starter and gently pry open his beak then put the food in his mouth then dip his beak into the sugar water and lift up his neck so that he can swallow it also remember to hold your chick touch is important touch is important and without it the chick will die the other chicks would touch your chick and if it were in a natural situation it would be tucked under its mothers wing tips to prevent this from happening again make sure that your floor isn t a slippery surface newspaper for example is the worst flooring possible for chicks they can slip on it and get straddle legs straddle legs is when a chick does a split and then can t walk any longer this is possible to fix with a splint us flooring such as rutted paper towels cloth towels if you are going to use newspaper make sure there is straw on the bottom to help then get traction make sure that your brooder is chick proof is there anything your chick could have gotten caught on broken legs don t just occur something happened to your chick make sure that there is enough room around the feeder and waterier if there isn t the chicks will peck at one another and sometimes a chick can get hurt when a chick gets to the sleepy point like you described he she usually doesn t make it i wish you luck with your chicks  Aerial (dance move) Chicken Professional wrestling holds Equine conformation Diving Kakapo Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Japanese tea ceremony Capercaillie Shaggy dog story Seabird The Shining (film) Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling match types Fire fighting Customs and etiquette of Japan Hiking Breastfeeding Milton H.

i want a bird i want a bird that will follow me and not fly away and that will become a best friend to me do you have any idea for a bird that will be easy to train p s i would perfure a little bird but a big one will work too p p s plus can you give me some tips on how to train it if this is your first bird you won't want a larger parrot heads up birds are noisey the bigger the louder usually although conures are loud and they aren't big messy food water and poop all over destructive antique wood furniture say bye bye and even the little guys can be loud at times what they lack in volume they make up for by doing it all the time they require about an hour a day out of the cage on average unless you want a screaming feather plucking biting crazy bird if you are still sure you want a bird then i'd say a cockatiel they are friendly and love to ride on your shoulder but all birds can fly and if a window is open they will fly away and you may not get them back it's not like a dog a bird can become your best friend although it will take awhile for you and the bird to bond birds are fun because unlike dogs they don't always have the will to please they are so full of personality say come and they be like to you ha and go right back to playing it's very much like having a toddler for at least years they never do what you want them to do when you want them to do it so if you aren't at all intimidated by any of those facts a tiel could be for you but you will have to do a lto of research you can't start any training until the bird settles in but the first thing you teach is step up and step down most birds learn very quickly you just go to get them to get on your hand and say step up and when they get on your hand then you praise them do this for about minutes a day and during the day ask your bird to do ti while your playing be consistant and then once he knows step up teach step down just go up to his play stand or cage and say step down when he gets of your hand praise him birds respond well to praise the best way to train is to ignore bad behavior and use little disicpline and lots more praise praise the good and ignore the bad except biting that should be disciplined once they know step up and step down they will be more handable and after that you can teach them to turn around on commadn fly to you on command roll over fetch car keys and even learn to count they may not be able to talk but my tiel was in the process of learning to use peg thing with little rings i would say blue rings and he would actually start to get blue rings on the peg they are soo smart give them lots of toys to detroy and explore but udnerstand training any trick will take lots and lots of patience for you if your bird doesn't get it move on to something else no reason to get him all upset  Dog training RuneScape quests Aerial (dance move) Hamster Shaggy dog story Dog Theory of conduct Garfield Social rule Piccolo Junior Saga Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Harp Time Out of Mind Bird Humphrey Bogart Violin Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Blonde on Blonde Tai shogi The Shining (film) German grammar Swingout Taikyoku shogi Falconry Obedience training Double bass Paragliding W.

has anyone ever heard of putting crushed red pepper in bird feed to keep squirrels out yes cayenne pepper is used this is because only mammals have the taste buds that can taste hot spice's birds are unaffected they have no idea the cayenne pepper is mixed in with the seed mankind and birds are the only animals insects not withstanding that purposely eat hot peppers the hot peppers do not affect the birds in anyway except health wise for the vitamins cornell feeding study the efficacy of capsaicin treated sunflower seed as a repellent to birdseed consumption by free ranging gray squirrels dr paul d curtis ms elizabeth rowland dr joseph a dunn cornell cooperative extension department of natural resources cornell university ithaca new york abstract eastern gray squirrels sciurus carolinensis are considered to be a pest by many bird lovers because they can steal significant quantities of seed from birdfeeders none of the available methods of protecting birdseed against squirrels is completely effective we assessed the efficacy of treating birdseed with capsaicin oleoresin as a means of deterring squirrels consumption of treated and untreated whole black oil sunflower seed was compared by carrying out one choice feeding trials at three sites near ithaca new york from may to june untreated seed was provided in weeks and and capsaicin treated seed was offered in weeks and it was concluded that treating the sunflower hearts with capsaicin while keeping the shell intact does effectively deter squirrels from eating the seed the use of this seed provides a solution to the problem of squirrels stealing seed from bird feeders making this a commercially viable product we also showed that this treatment of seed has no noticeable effect on the frequency of bird visits where bird populations are low and may increase visit frequency where bird populations are high this would further enhance the marketability of this seed http www ebirdseed com page eb ctgy faq http www napa ufl edu news peppers htm  Capsaicin Chile pepper Squirrel Capsicum Gypsy moth Omega-3 fatty acid Genetically modified food Red Squirrel Acorn Peanut Alcohol fuel Breastfeeding Chicken Organic farming Prostate cancer Malaria Tocopherol Guinea pig Pesticide Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Clinical depression Red Hot Chili Peppers Vitamin C Cannabis (drug) Biodiesel Hamster Chocolate Agriculture Biological pest control Cornell University Growth hormone treatment Fancy rat Bird Common cold Black pepper Solanaceae Apple Economics Bicycle helmet Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Dog Gaucho (insecticide) Domestic rabbit Insulin BitTorrent Vegetarianism Bread Wine Food Alternative medicine Tuberculosis Herpes simplex virus Milk Hemp Tree squirrel DDT Microeconomics Tofu Genetic engineering Neurofeedback Psoriasis Watermelon Stuttering Spyware Dairy Sewage treatment Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ithaca, New York Soul food Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Sorghum Obesity Atkins Nutritional Approach German cuisine Hot sauce Wind power Southern Flying Squirrel Shotgun Cancer Inflation Livestock Zinc Water Cocaine Patent medicine Osteoarthritis

what do you feed a baby bird i found a bay bird on my porch yesterday it has feather and all and i think it broke it's wings trying to fly i've been feeding it bread soaked in milk it won't eat much of the bread but drinks the milk i just tried feeding it worms but it won't eat it dose anybody know what i should feed it and what i should do about it's broken wing don't give it milk birds do not have the right enzymes for dairy products go to petco or petsmart and buy a bag of powdered bird formula something like this http www petco com product kaytee exact hand feeding formula for all baby birds aspx yes the formula is meant for parrots but it will work for wild birds too follow the instructions on the bag and everything will be fine everything you feed it must be in liquid form baby birds don't eat whole worms and they don't swallow them whole either bread and worms and anything not liquid will not work if you don't have time to buy the formula yet boil a few eggs but leave the yolk slightly soft get rid of the whites and mash up the yolks the yolk must be soft if you have dog kibble add some water to it put it in the microwave and cut it up into tiny pieces mix it up with the yolks the food should be mostly yolk just a little bit of the kibble you must feed your formula warm but not hot you can burn a baby bird's throat very easily basically put your finger in the mixture before you feed it it should be warm but not hot that is the safest way to tell if your bird can eat it the mixture will be a thick liquid if you have a chopstick or something similarily shaped a straw you can use it to scoop a tiny gob of food onto an end and feed it that way or if you buy the bird formula it should come with a needle less syringe that can also be used don't force feed the bird if it is not hungry as a precaution i dont know if its already too late but baby birds require feeding a lot sometimes more than twice an hour you need to get the right food and formula what i described as soon as you can because milk and bread and worms will starve it to death good luck  Tofu Kosher foods Chicken Breastfeeding Dairy Bread Brewery Egg (food) Soy milk Jewish cuisine Breakfast Cuisine of Denmark Tea Cantonese cuisine Coffee Textile manufacturing Customs and etiquette of Japan Japanese cuisine Milk Japanese tea ceremony Ice cream Chocolate Vegetarianism Baby bottle RuneScape quests German cuisine Bengali cuisine Dairy product Pizza Sea-Monkey Seabird Bong Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Carburetor Snake 613 mitzvot Idli Healthy eating Casting Bird Fried chicken Beer Hot dog Leather Mayonnaise Salmon Paint Kakapo Hedgehog Tempera Korean cuisine Capercaillie Dim sum Roman eating and drinking Plastic Domesticated turkey Soup Date Palm Platypus Caffeine Ant Fecal incontinence Mosquito Yoghurt Egg (biology) Shark Intravenous therapy Foie gras Spider Cajun cuisine Dog Mattress Ayyavazhi religious practices Livestock Carbon dioxide Basic English Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Cochineal Cheese Food Cocaine Bird migration Pottery Ammonia Falconry Chinese cuisine Cookie Rice pudding Chopsticks Omega-3 fatty acid Soft drink Infant formula

i have new neighbours with homing pidgeons i have new neighbours with homing pidgeons they only moved in weeks ago and yet the pidgeons know their way to their new adress how is it that a bird with a small brain can find it's way from camdon to essex they brought them with them in what seemed to be old fashioned picnic baskets the wooden kind that the famous used to use in the books famous five go adventuring etc like the time when they solved the murder and that other time when they found the kidnappers and reported them to the police a bit like black bag the fateful border collie that was in viz who used to solve the mysteries but then it all went a bit wrong a bit like ross mcgwerter from the guinness book of records who slid down a wall and sadly died leaving his brother to run the show so no i wont bother then with this trivia many thanks for your answer which was like a breath of fresh air amongst the spoggy answers from other people which is a bit like when batman fell into that cave and was frightened by them bats which was a bit like how i am feeling now ah well they've come to take my crayons must go thankyou very much a tata homing pigeons are awesome they may not have the same type of intelligence you or your parrot has but don't underestimate them they have a natural homing instinct that has been bred in them for thousands of years and a strong drive to return home to their mate and their nest it is thought that they use magnetic fields of the earth to navigate their way home researchers put magnets on the heads of homing pigeons and they got completely screwed up and lost homing pigeons also rank as one of the fastest birds on the planet they have been reported to fly as fast as mph and can fly hundreds of miles nonstop at speeds averaging mph which in my opinion is pretty impressive for a bird that has such a bad reputation  Bird Homing pigeon Rock Dove RuneScape quests 2000 Australian Grand Prix Fast bowling The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Theory of conduct Tenchi Muyo!

my bird bit me ok so i've had this bird for about months and he's probably a little less than a year old he is a green and yellow parakeet i had him out today and he randomly bit my finger he has never done this before and i don't know why he did it he was just sitting on my finger and i put my other finger up for him to step up but instead he bit it then a couple minutes later he was on my finger and he started biting the back of my hand i wasn't antagonizing him at all he was just sitting there and chomp this wasn't just a little nibble either it was definitly a bite now i know that there might not be a specific reason for this but i thought i'd ask anyway but what i really want to know is how i can teach him not to do this after he bit me i told him no but there wasn't really a reaction then i put him back in his cage what else can i do to help him learn not to do this thanks he's a young bird he's just exploring my conure uses her beak to pull herself onto my finger sometimes and that's harder than what i would call a nibble but she isn't doing it to hurt me she's using it like a branch i don't mind i just tell her be gentle and she's starting to get it but when your bird shows frustration and you make a mistake and then he bites you grab his beak if possible between your thumb and pointer finger knuckle and you say no firmly then put him in his cage for time out birds are actually pretty intelligent even budgies are smarter than a cat or dog so they can actually understand time out so putting him in his cage for minutes over time will help with the firm grab of the beak and the verbal no when he play bites young birds do this to test limits and explore tell him be gentle and rmeove your finger let him nibble on you to preen you and test you out but when he starts to get harder tell him be easy if he doens't listen and he bites harder grab his beak tell him no and time out after awhile he'll catch on you gotta start discipline right away so you prevent older birds from biting babies usually don't hurt as bad  Milton H.

we have a very horny cockatiel he has this one toy a ball of fuzz and string that he climbs on and pretends to mate with it my kids the older ones think it's the funniest thing on earth but when the younger kids ask what fargo the bird is doing all i can come up with is he's just playing but the stupid bird does it all the time i tried taking the toy out but then he just sits in the corner of his cage and does nothing he won't sing or eat or anything any ideas on how to fix this problem without getting another female bird well it will be kinda hard to break that habit of his he is probably ready for mating now and if you don't let him mate he will become very stressed out and or depress i've known bird owners that let their birds mate with their hands just so the bird will be at ease and this is true if they don't let the bird mate with their hands the bird will get upset with you and wouldn't want to do anythign with you i guess the bird sees them as their mate anyway best for you to get another female or just let him finish it off with teh toy just make sure the kids aren't around o  Hamster The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Spider Kodocha Eric Cartman Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Rich Mullins Shaggy dog story Social rule Garfield One Piece minor characters Falconry Friends Procrastination Dog Theory of conduct Piccolo Junior Saga Species Salad Fingers Sexual reproduction Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Trailer Park Boys Humphrey Bogart I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Doraemon The Emancipation of Mimi Ultimate Muscle The Angry Beavers Ron and Fez The Adventures of Pete & Pete Sin City Indianapolis 500 Chess strategy and tactics Shawn Michaels Tenshinhan Shit George Costanza Late Night with Conan O'Brien The Marshall Mathers LP Hun-Apu The Human Stain Jackass: The Movie Father's Day (Doctor Who) Hyakujuu Sentai GaoRanger Sesame Street Jon Secada Chess problem Treehouse of Horror V Non-native pronunciations of English Bart Simpson Time Out of Mind El Chavo del Ocho About a Boy South Park The Critic Kakapo Beavis and Butt-head House Mouse Nashville Skyline Liger Charly Garc__a Domestic rabbit Professional wrestling aerial techniques Care Bears Invader Zim Whose Line Is It Anyway?

please help unhappy chick my mums friend recently hatched a laod of chicks she sells them and one had trouble breaking through so she broke it out it is still not dried out after a day and it is the cutest and saddest thing you've ever seen its beack is crossed o it has toruble eating and drinking it only has one eye and probably can't see out the other one what can i do for it first you should let the chick dry off after a chick hatches you should leave it in the incubator till it is completely dry the incubator should be around degrees so in that temperature the chick should dry in around hours when the chicks are dried you can take them and put them into the brooder the brooder should be around degrees the bottom of the brooder needs to be covered by something like a grooved paper towels dishrags or what ever you have but keep in mind chicks will eat sawdust that is to small and can get sick tip never use newspaper or paper on the bottom of the brooder this is slippery and can cause injuries such as straddle legs in young chicks food in the brooder there should be enough room for all of the chicks to eat and drink lack of room can cause in injuries for water put in one tablespoon of sugar per gallon this will give the chicks a boost as for feed get the chicks a good quality chick starter at the local feed shop stopping chicks from pecking each other use a red light bulb put grass or straw on the bottom of the cage so the birds have something to peck at how to tell if it is to hot or to cold if the chicks are huddled together near the heat source they are cold and the temp needs to get hotter if they are all at the edges of the brooder and not near the light it is to hot and the temp needs to go down if the chicks are spread out in all areas of the brooder the temp is right the temperature should drop degrees every week till you get to degrees then they should be kept around that temperature if it is warm enough outside you can let them out how to care for a chick that can t eat hold it then take your fingernail and gently pry open it s beak slip in some chick starter water down the chick starter till it is mushy then dip its beak in the water do not go past the holes in the beak that is the nostrils lift its head up so it can swallow repeat till you think he has eaten enough when do chicks open their eyes a little after they hatch if it is any longer your bird may be blind when do chicks walk they try to walk after they dry out they can t walk completely till around their second day of life what to do with sick chicks remove them from the brooder give them their own that is comfortable with food and water if it has a leg problem make sure the cage is small so it can t move around much hand feed them if your chick gets to badly of the best thing to do would be to put it down if a chick doesn t look so well and it is in with the other  Bread Capercaillie Sauna Hamster Temperature Japanese tea ceremony Emu Coffee Dairy Seabird Shaggy dog story Bird 1957 World Series Aerial (dance move) Garfield Sento Albatross Customs and etiquette of Japan Equine conformation Cuisine of the Philippines Professional wrestling holds Yoghurt Kodocha Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Agar plate Fecal incontinence Drag racing Textile manufacturing Brewery Swimming Cuisine of Denmark Manicure Happy Tree Friends Menstrual cup Alcohol fuel First aid Diving suit Snake Fancy rat Mattress Houseplant Drowning Yerba mate Sorghum Bird migration Tea Professional wrestling slang Cannabis cultivation Fire fighting Casting Thermal power station Common cold Water Babe Ruth Hyperthermia Diving Domestic rabbit Friends Light-emitting diode Animal communication Nile crocodile Diseases of the honeybee Foodborne illness Poker jargon Tofu Drill bit March of the Penguins Tuatara Vermicompost Spark plug Hiking The Ersatz Elevator Strap-on dildo Roman eating and drinking Pysanka Glass Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 African Fish Eagle House Sparrow Seismic retrofit Dialysis Gramophone record Mercury Atlas 6 Puff pastry Punt (boat)

questions about perches would it be safe to just take a branch from any tree outside and put screws into them and make your own natural perches i went to petsmart and was going to purchase each natural perch for about dollars each adn my brother in law was with me he works with a lot of wood adn said that i could just make them myself with screws and branches off a tree but i am worried about bugs and little mites and stuff would it be safe to do what he said by just using regular branchs or should i just buy the ones from the pet store you have to be very careful about using branches from trees outside make sure it hasn't been sprayed with pesticide make sure it's a bird safe wood and make sure you clean it before you get it anywhere near your bird you can actually put it in the oven on low heat for a while to kill any bugs and other nasty things  Diseases of the honeybee Canary Upholstery Biological pest control Pesticide Gypsy moth Mosquito Hamster Neopets Passerine Falconry Drill bit Christmas tree Air pollution Northern Mockingbird Brewery Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Stove Bedbug Fancy rat Pet skunk Surveillance Shotgun Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an RuneScape quests Bugs Bunny DDT Fluorescent lamp Heinkel He 100 Into the Woods Mountaineering RuneScape locations Organic food Garfield Organic farming Renewable energy Mel Blanc Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Apple Bulk vending Foodborne illness Hyuga Hinata USS Perch (SS-176) Theory of conduct Jackass: The Movie Agricultural wastewater treatment Illegal drug trade Dog Fuse (electrical) Legend of Mana Bacon Chaos (video game) Ivory-billed Woodpecker Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy Boat building Social rule Humphrey Bogart Bird feeder Fire fighting Honeybee Explosive material A Bug's Life Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) Bat Boy Donald Rumsfeld Ethics College Roomies from Hell!!!

what are perches for birds everytime i hear someone talking about birds i hear or read the word perches what exactly is perches cause i am getting a budgie and they say i should get wooden perches not plasticc but i don't know what they are lol the purpose of hte perch is to act as a tree limb a place for the bird to sit rest the bottom of the cage is not ideal for them because of the shape their claws are designed to hug the braches of trees and such you can buy ready made perches for bird cages or you can buy wooden dowels and cut a slit in each end it's better to have several perches at sever different heights in the cage depending on the size wooden perches often work better but require more maintanence because they are harder to clean and you have to be sure not to get wood that has been treated plastic is easier to clean but then you run the risk of the birds ingesting the plastic if they chew them and they usually don't feel as comfortable or natural  Hamster Upholstery Wood Drill bit Chair Bong Equine conformation Knife Canoe Mattress John Cage Violin Wood carving Falconry RuneScape quests Domestic rabbit Trapping Chopsticks Chinchilla Menstrual cup Mealy Parrot Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Leopard Brush Fancy rat Screw Strap-on dildo Archery Wire Boat building Bird bath Table saw Northern Mockingbird Canary Sento Dinghy Shotgun Deforestation Dairy Golf Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Japanese tea ceremony Passerine Clarinet Peafowl Portsmouth Block Mills Guinea pig Salad Fingers Woodworking Kayak Bird flight Lake Burley Griffin Bicycle frame Stairway Mojave people Axe Cello Kashrut Bow (weapon) Beretta 92F/FS Snake Brassiere Ivory-billed Woodpecker Bookbinding Spanking Monopoly (game) Dog agility Angling Mixed martial arts Floppy disk Punt (boat) Soap Radio controlled airplane Lumber Chewing gum Plastic Skateboard Gypsy moth Coconut crab Surveillance Funeral Diamond cut Happy Tree Friends The Cure Wound Diving Anchor Trail blazing Aztec Aikido Seismic retrofit Lathe Professional wrestling holds Windsurfing Hearing impairment Bleeding Ski Hand grenade Perch

about our yr old cockatiel charlie was a sweetheart until a few months ago when he started to attack us we have no idea what happened maybe he was frightened we have had work being done on the house so the noises have really stressed him we restricted him to his cage since he started chewing on the window screens and my husband won't let me clip his wings he says it's cruel and no argument will change his mind now he sets in the cage miserable and plucking feathers and is nearly naked any suggestions will be appreciated i really love him even though he has bonded with my husband instead will his feathers grow back he has pulled them out under his wings breast stomach and legs it's so pitiful as he is a beautiful bird a few months ago was cockatiel mating season at that time many cockatiels go hormonal and become very terriroial and aggressive they can and sometimes do attack the hormones are raging for to weeks after which the bird reverts back to its old habits so basically the bird went through a temporary breakdown and now finds himself in solitary confinement his tiny brain does not understand why he is lonely and unhappy so he has begun plucking his feathers just like stressed people will sometimes bite their nails even to the quick ther bird is feeling confused and betrayed you must regain his trust this can be done but it will take a lot of time and patience expect to be nipped a few times but do not punish the bird other than a stern no bite and leaving him alone begin by spending lots of time with him even if he is in his cage talk to him in a soothing voice praise him sing to him read to him anything to interact with the bird this needs to be for at least to hours per day when he shows signs of being calmer try giving him special treats through the bars sunflower seeds room temperature cooked pasta crackers fruits and veggies or whatever he likes best make sure that he only gets the treats if he takes them from your hand nicely don't drop treats into the cage or the food bowl he needs to know that treats come from you and your husband alone he must socialize to get his treats after he has shown that he will readily take treats from you try opening the cage and offerring the treat at the door of the cage let the bird come to you he will soon learn to come to you for his treat next after giving him a treat try gently stroking his chest and tummy if he withdraws or gets aggressive just close up the cage and leave him alone for a few hours eventually he will become more tolerant to your touch as the last step when he is comfortable with your touch then try offerring your finger for him to step up on while you say step up he should get the idea fairly quickly at this stage he has demonstrated that he trusts you fully next year watch for the mating season usually in the spring if the bird shows signs of aggression then put him in his cage but be sure to spend time with him talking to him each day even if he is acting aggressive you should eventually become adept at recognising the bad times and dealing with them  Breastfeeding Hamster RuneScape quests Milton H.

help my cockatiel is pooping brown poop he is eating an all pepllet diet and ocasionly has millet the pellets are supposed to be a lot better for him then an all seed diet even his color is better but what is up with his poop he just started to poop this color an hour ago i do feed them vegies and have had them on seed for years and when they were on seed they were very thin and had dull color but now that they are on pellets they are nice and healthy great you feed veggies too i have personally found that those who feed a pellet diet are not lazy they're simply miss informed i don't think that sort of talk is really neccessary a great variety of veggies is essential along with cockatiel pellets natural preferably seed daily is also fine there is no reason to not offer seed to a species bird that eats it naturally in the wild all you need to do is limit the intake of the seed daily offer 'good' cockatiel seed it is the limit of daily seed bad seeds being offered that has made people completely cut out seed all togeter not neccessary to if don'e correctly read the ingredients on all frozen foods as many do contain salt as an alternative you can blanch fresh veg inn hot water freeze it meal portions if ya have any crappy seed left it's not old you can try sprouting it if you're unsuccessful at sprouting a simple soak for hours will do both of these are a great deal healthier than dry seed as all others have said it sounds like the pellets have caused the poop it's good for you to observe this since different colour poo can be an indicatio of something wrong also a sudden change in diet isn't always the best thing to do even though your tiel is only only seed still a gradual change is better for the bird as a sudden diet change can cause helth problems you're off to an excellent start if he's eating pellets tiels can be a stick in the mud when it comes to changing their diet they're often very difficult to change over  Hamster Bread Tofu Domestic rabbit Veganism Common bean Breastfeeding Ramen Chicken Jewish cuisine Domesticated turkey Fancy rat Tea Tooth Sorghum Peanut Color Dieting Species Bengali cuisine Healthy eating Organic food Maize Mealy Parrot Rice Theory of conduct Raw food diet Apple French fries Dog Pikmin Cuisine of Brazil Textile manufacturing Coffee In-N-Out Burger Goldfish Acorn Tomato Capercaillie Seed Vitamin C Idli Bacon Omega-3 fatty acid Miso Cockatiel Watermelon Cannabis cultivation Chocolate Potato Atkins Nutritional Approach Cuisine of Malaysia Foie gras Cuisine of Denmark Hypoglycemia Obesity Thermoregulation Flowering plant Cereal Albatross Cantonese cuisine Domestication Genetically modified food Curry Folic acid Chile pepper Blood (computer game) Soy milk Coriander Fugu Livestock Zinc Salmon Japanese cuisine Debugging Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Feces Nicomachean Ethics Carbon dioxide Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Stomach cancer Famine Japanese tea ceremony Wood Shit Gray Wolf Vegetarian cuisine Foodborne illness Water Plastic Little Britain Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma

how should parakeets act when u first bring them home i just bought a parakeet home on the way over it was really chirpy but now it hardly even chirps it sits on the perch mostly all the time i am not sure if it has eaten or drank any of the water since being home should i be concerened my parakeet took weeks before it started chirping then another only took a day so it varies it is normal for them to be quiet at first they are getting used to their surroundings they look like they're not doing anything but in actual fact they are paying attention to everything that is going on it is good to have them in a social part of your house be patient i found music would get my new parakeets chirping check your seed tray for empty seed husks then you'll know if it has been eating and of course pooping new parakeets often have watery stools to start with that's a stress reaction keep talking to it and soon it will loosen up and you won't be able to shut it up have fun and good luck  Urinary incontinence Chirp Fecal incontinence Dietary fiber Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shaggy dog story Diarrhea Poker jargon Dialysis Pikmin Social rule Japanese tea ceremony Betting (poker) Irritable bowel syndrome Marathon (sport) Animal Crossing Cricket (insect) Dairy The Amazing Race National Football League Customs and etiquette of Japan Certified Nursing Assistant Sonar Feces Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

stepped on cockatiel feathers my hubby stepped on the tail feathers of our cockatiel because it got in the way all the tail feathers came out the bird does not seem to be upset because of it will they grow back i know i can't let it fly and it's wings had already been clipped the cockatiel is very tame and friendly and plays with us it likes people maybe that is why it gets in the way what can i do about the tail feathers yes they will grow back with no problem cockatiels rarely venture onto a floor in normal situations they realize that they are vulnerable there you might want to ensure that the bird is not allowed on the floor so that he doesn't get in the way again  Cockatiel Chicken Moult Feather Bird Capercaillie Peafowl Falconry Cockatoo Kakapo Mario Archaeopteryx Seabird Bird flight P-38 Lightning Equine conformation The Legend of Zelda series enemies Rainbow Bee-eater Characters in Bleach series Haibane Renmei Escape from New York 108 form Wu family T'ai Chi Ch'uan Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Pterosaur Characters in the Smurfs Piccolo Junior Saga Rugby union positions Dog Havanese Minor Harry Potter Beasts Fly lure Cat Pok__mon Colosseum Albatross Archangel (comics) Icarus (mythology) Volleyball European Nightjar Condor Prairie Falcon Parrot Gray Wolf RuneScape quests GunZ The Duel Monster Rancher monsters B-24 Liberator Bedknobs and Broomsticks Hippogriff European Kingfisher Bird ringing B-47 Stratojet Creatures in Bionicle Heinkel He 100 Universal Century Technology Dinosaur The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Glossary of partner dance terms P-47 Thunderbolt Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Bird strike Christmas tree Wa shogi Scarlet Macaw Lyrebird Chocobo RuneScape weapons Buckingham Palace White-tailed Ptarmigan Black-eared Wheatear Pitaten Tengu Flightless bird Red-tailed Hawk Missingno.

lovebird fleas or preening my new lovebird is constantly scratching itself on its head and preening itself does it have fleas or some kind of mite or is this normal i have never had one before can you buy flea powder for birds birds do preen alot but if it seems like it's constant and it's more scratching than moving the feathers through it's beak it could have mites or lice there are sprays you can buy to spray right on the bird and it's advised to totally clean and disinfect the cage toys nesting materials and keep them very clean well always but especially when trying to get rid of mites as they can live off the host for about a week until the mites lice are gone most are very very very small so a completely positive diagnosis would be to take it to a vet to figure out exactly what type of mite it is or if it's lice  Canary Fancy rat Chicken Diseases of the honeybee Flea Allergy Guinea pig Bird Kakapo Biological pest control Hamster Ferret Scabies Louse Mange Lovebird Bulk vending Clothing Head louse Albatross Mealy Parrot Dog agility Moult Capercaillie Hair Dinosaur Stork Hyacinth Macaw Red Hot Chili Peppers Japanese tea ceremony Dog Wheel of Fortune Sterilization (microbiology) Crab louse Genericized trademark Garfield Hand grenade Shotgun Bird of prey Bird flight Turok: Rage Wars Northern Cardinal Tick RuneScape economy Animal communication Chinese food therapy Sesame Street Linked list House dust mite Feather Tweety Bird Tungiasis Isle of Wight Upholstery Gramophone record Grebe __Mucha Lucha!

parakeet question my two parakeets have become obsessed with each other i know they are both males so it is not a mate issue you can no longer take one of them out of the cage to play without them screeching and they immediately fly back to the cage also their food dishes that came with the cage i had before i bought are rather deep so when i put their food in there they have to lean in to them to get their food and then all the seed they have popped open just falls back down in the dish i feel like i am wasting food when i dump out their dishes because the good seed is at the bottom do i need to get a smaller dish or should i just leave the food in there and let them dig for it any advice would be great first of all to the smartasses who decided to be extremely rude when answering questions i do have the right cage for me parakeets secondly i do not feed them just seed they eat whatever i eat which is basically different every day i was pertaining to the millet spray in their cage which was given as a treat making the mess lastly their wings are clipped i would not own a bird in my home who did not have their wings clipped and they should not be kept in separate cages they are flocking birds they are meant to be kept in pairs and if you do not have any useful information to give keep your mouths shut thank you to those of you who were very nice and had good answers you don't have to dump the seed to get the hulls out take the cup outside pour it in your hand slowly while blowing and the hulls will blow out and the good seed will be left just make sure that you don't mistake hulls for seeds and starve your birds i read on the internet that some dummy did just that starved their bird thinking they had seed and it was just hulls also i adopted a parakeet from an old man who had to go into a nursing home had i not gotten his when i did he would have probably starved because the dummy that was supposed to be caring for him thought that was seed and it was just hulls when i went to pick up the bird i could have given that guy a good smack but the bird was so happy to be in a good home we brought him home and introduced him to our parakeet and they became fast friends immediately  Hamster Chicken Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Canary Shaggy dog story Bird Knots Landing EastEnders Social rule Customs and etiquette of Japan Trapping Theory of conduct Parrot 2000 Australian Grand Prix Anorexia nervosa Domestic rabbit Little Britain The Ashlee Simpson Show 613 mitzvot Sub-Zero Equine conformation Russian joke The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Seabird Brewery Monk Parakeet Albatross Breastfeeding Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Ron and Fez 1957 World Series Professional wrestling match types Textile manufacturing John Cage Late Night with Conan O'Brien Aerial (dance move) Poker jargon Salad Fingers Japanese tea ceremony John the Baptist Viva La Bam Chopsticks Bread Doom enemies First English Civil War Ranma __ characters Happy Tree Friends Avenue Q Humphrey Bogart Stomach cancer Cliff Richard Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Futurama (TV series - season 4) Contract bridge Elephant Hemp Kodocha Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Eddie Guerrero Cruising (maritime) Saruman Socrates Good Morning, Vietnam John Kerr Athrun Zala Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma YuYu Hakusho Kakapo Ruy Lopez Guinea pig Ant RuneScape Random Events Gray Wolf Saved by the Bell Characters in the Smurfs Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!

my birds won't eat pellet food why i have given my cockatiels seeds for the longest time someone told me that seeds were not as good for them as a pellet diet so i switched none of the birds will eat the pellets most of the pellets would wind up on the cage floor i could see no signs that the birds were eating them so went back to seed which now they are happily eating again should i stick with seed or try pellets again i don't want them to starve but i want them all to have a healthy diet also what should i do your cockatiels are used to the seed diet unfortunately seed diets are not sufficient for them some birds simply do not like pellets but there are some things that may improve their diets first make sure the pellets are small cockatiels will not chew on large pellets you might try crushing the pellets and see if the birds will eat some of them then you can do that by hand or can use a pepper mill of coffee grinder add the pellets to your seeds some seeds are ok as long as the birds get the nutrition they need add fruits and veggies to their food this is a must if they don't like fresh ones they get dried fruits and veggies my cockatiels love their dried foods cut up the dried foods into pieces about one eighth inch across they won't try to eat large pieces of this either add some crushed egg shell to their food this gives them adds calcium you can try adding some cheerios or chex cereal too most birds like some form of cereal although it may take some experimenting to find out which ones get the vitamin enriched ones and try to avoid the sugared ones except for occasional special treats this will provide you with a great diet for your teils i have been feeding mine this diet for years and their colors are bright and beautiful while my birds are healthy and happy good luck  Hamster Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Vegetarianism Veganism Fancy rat Rice Chicken Maize Egg (food) Bread Folic acid Nutrition Chocolate Date Palm Cheerios Tofu Ramen Vitamin C Healthy eating Cereal Dieting Omega-3 fatty acid Garfield Food Tooth Shotgun Jewish cuisine Sugar Peanut Hamburger Fecal incontinence Frugivore Apple Chile pepper Stomach cancer Tea Breakfast Tlingit Potato Dog food Milk Raw food diet Cuisine of Denmark Carbon dioxide Acorn Coconut crab Peruvian cuisine Goldfish Kosher foods Food guide pyramid Coffee Coeliac disease Mango Cyanocobalamin Chili con carne Vermicompost Vegetarian nutrition Idli Textile manufacturing Breastfeeding Breakfast cereal Atkins Nutritional Approach Fruitarianism German cuisine Flowering plant Fruit Soy milk Cuisine of Malaysia Agriculture Garlic Capercaillie Kashrut Hypoglycemia Miso Zinc One Piece minor characters Cuisine of the Philippines Nuclear fuel cycle Dietary fiber Albatross Pomegranate South Beach diet Roman eating and drinking Nut (fruit) Pysanka Cockatiel Foie gras Sugarcane Potassium Crohn's disease

what causes a cardinal to loose all his head feathers i have one that comes to the bird feeder and he does not look well i thought he might be molting but it is only his head feathers missing well you have pretty much heard all the most plausible answers i have a male cockatiel that gets his head plucked by his mate sometimes birds do this when they are unhappy with their mate sure glad my wife is not a bird it could have mites this is not a deadly disease but causes a bird a lot of discomfort i don't know of anything you can do for a wild bird with mites since it usually requires a trip to the vet molting would not cause a bird to lose the feathers on his head because he could not pull them out with his beak molting may make a bird look sort of patchy an ratty but it does not make a bird lose all the feathers from any area pin feathers the quills that have been mentioned will itch very badly but they do not just fall out if the bird can reach them he will usually pull them out other birds will sometimes groom their friends to remove these but the pin feathers never comprise all the feathers on any given area this problem with the cardinal does not sound serious most likely a dissatisfied mate but regardless you are unable to do anything about it it is illegal to catch wild birds even to help them or save their life if you are seriously worried then call your state department of natural resources fish and game and report the problem they have wild bird rehabilitaters who are trained to help wild birds  Bird Moult Tick Peafowl Seabird Canary Domesticated turkey RuneScape quests Feather New York Giants Ferret Chicken Spider Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Guinea pig Poker jargon Kakapo Dog Shaggy dog story Krill Diseases of the honeybee Falconry Trapping Piccolo Junior Saga Cockatiel Fox hunting Northern Cardinal Bird flight Albatross Dinosaur Archaeopteryx Nerpa Elephant Sexual dimorphism Penguin Babe Ruth Chess terminology Tyrannosaurus rex Light pollution Emu Hamster Ostrich Tarantula American lobster Biological pest control Fancy rat St. Louis Cardinals Ruy Lopez Sin City Depilation Mercury 4 Professional wrestling holds Garfield Condor Heartworm Antarctic krill Gypsy moth Mosquito The Muppets Ivory-billed Woodpecker Big Bird Chess (musical) Theory of conduct Kitzmiller v.

question about budgie wing clipping my birds are already tame but don't really play with me when i let them out they usually just fly straight to a curtain rod and stay there or fly around then go back there lol so i was wondering if i got their wings clipped would they be more dependant on me and if i do get their wings clipped will they need to be tamed again is clipping wings very stressful for the birds thank you for your answers in advance clipping their wings will make them more dependent upon you that usually means that they bond to you and become more friendly it also prevents them from getting lost in the event a door or window is found to be open i suggest you get the wings clipped they do not like it but they will hold no grudges against you as for the curtain rod flights you need to show them that they must come to you this can be taught in less than minutes all you need to do is get a long stick broomstick or similar size that will reach up to the curtain rods when the bird flies to the curtain rod chase him off it by placing the stick in front of him as if he is going to step up onto it when he flies to another rod chase him and repeat the stick maneuver keep this up until he gets too tired to fly at which time he will step up onto the stick then bring the stick down gently and have the bird step up onto your finger while you say step up he may fly off again in which case you chase him down and repeat the exercise eventually he will step up onto your finger when he gets tired enough at that time put your other hand up present your finger and say step up you should eventually be able to get him to step up from one hand to the other several times with repeated exercises he will eventually step up on command when you present your finger to him in his cage this is a very valuable command since you can use step up to show the bird that you are in charge if he misbehaves simply make him do several repetitions of step up this is usually all the punishment a bird needs when he misbehaves  Aerial (dance move) Equine conformation The Price Is Right Marching band Glossary of American football Revolver Fast bowling Tag Parade (military) Puppet Heinkel He 112 Textile manufacturing Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Falconry Glossary of climbing terms Professional wrestling holds Avenue Q B-47 Stratojet Tai shogi International League Apollo 8 STS-114 Archaeopteryx Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mattress Monty Hall problem Radio controlled airplane Professional wrestling throws Avro Arrow 2000 Australian Grand Prix Wa shogi Chopsticks Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Timpani Napier's bones Chess terminology G-Man (Half-Life) Shen Gong Wu P-47 Thunderbolt Cessna T-37 M16 (rifle) The Time Machine Carpal tunnel syndrome Paragliding Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Boxing RuneScape Random Events Scientology beliefs and practices Dog agility The Empty Child Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Space Shuttle Columbia disaster NASCAR Softball Creatures in Bionicle Russian joke Bat The Ashlee Simpson Show Ko shogi Violin Poker jargon Inspector Gadget Rugby union positions Repetitive strain injury Chicken Non-native pronunciations of English Wright brothers Obedience training Volleyball Royal Assent 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Theodicy Professional wrestling match types The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Weight training The Shining (film) Double the Fist The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Menstrual cup Stuttering Blonde on Blonde Trapping Taikyoku shogi Tai Chi Chuan Welding The Subtle Knife Dai shogi Ancient Egyptian weights and measures Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Aikido GunZ The Duel John Cage Knight Rider Haibane Renmei One Ring

macaws does anybody know a good breeder in conneticut or new york who has macaws also can you tell me some facts about macaws do you know any good breeders from conneticut and how large does a cage for a macaw have to be i don't know any breeders but go to yahoo search and type in birds for sale that's what i did a two years ago to get my beautiful and year old male macaw othello also i'm from upstate ny macaws are of course very large birds one might cost you anywhere from with the average being around per bird depending on the breeder or wherever you get yours from i got mine in a private sale from the birds for sale site in new jersey southern now cages for these birds are about as well they must be big enough for the bird to walk around in without hitting his tale on the sides cages can be purchased directly online and there are some really good deals on ebay as well ok about macaws they are loud oh are they loud they let out a screetch that could pierce your eardrum especially when they are hungry bored or just want you to come play with them they love company but usually bond to only one family member they are not good with kids and i wouldn't have a cat either mine was raised with dogs and is fine with them when they eat and they eat almost anything but should mostly eat pellets with seeds and peanuts and dried fruits and fresh fruits and veggies also telly gets seeds and pellets in the morning cup then pieces of fruit throughout the day and shares some of my lunch and dinner he gets the veggies and a few tiny pieces of meat they are messy eaters oh heck they are messy period i have heavy plastic the kind of stuff you use in office under your desk chairs under the cage and i top that with newspaper his food he plays with and swishes around in his dish and it goes all over the place be prepared for a lot of vacuuming and mopping oh he will also need a bathroom perch for showers they love to shower with you and a regular perch if you plan on training him because you do not want to train him from his cage my macaw does talk and talk and talk mostly hello barb and what's up it gets annoying sometimes but thank goodness for other rooms in the house he loves to go outside so i take him to the vets to get his wings and claws clipped every about once every months call your local vet to see if they do aviary or they will be able to tell you what local vet will see your bird sexing the bird can be done with dna test blood test sometimes like in my case the bird has already been tested i know he's male he likes his cage left open and he sleeps at night in the dark on top of the cage he is good in the car but nasty to get in his travel cage he likes to bite still trying to teach him not to but old habits are hard to break these birds live to be about so make sure there is someone who will take him should you die telly will go to my son who has grown quite fond of him in recent months telly drinks water and orange juice loves orange juice and loves watermelon and banannas probably most of all and peanuts in the shell i'm constantly sweeping up shells but he is extremely funny and entertaining and most of the time a pure joy oh and he loves to dance to music put music on and he actually does move his feet and wings to the music and bobs his head it's quite comical to watch sometimes he will even whistle to the music although he is slightly off tone deaf i guess remember unless you have a trusted friend who gets used to your bird be prepared to not go anywhere for longer then a day they do not appreciate being alone for too long and mine is quite the watchdog when someone comes in a car he isn't used to he squawks like crazy and paces back and forth on top of his cage if i let the person in the house he is ok but if i just talk to the person from the other side of the screen door telly has a fit thank goodness i live in the country in my own home and away from any neighbors pretty much most of the macaws in the usa that are sold today are from hand raised birds they are not brought out of the wild they have been used to people all their lives yes it can be difficult owning a bird but if you get the right bird and are the right owner then it should be a happy match as long as you remember everything i have told you good and bad ps i've had my bird for almost years now and he has never plucked his feathers at all and last vet check he was in perfect physical condition the vet said i was taking extremely good care of him i have another little parrot that i have had for almost years  Domestic rabbit Hamster

can roosters that grow up together stay in the same cage i was ordering some chicks and if they grew up from baby to adult will they get along i have females will they fight for teritory or female or will it be ok if they grew up together your question depends on a few things first are you going to be keeping the roosters together by together i mean will they be in the same cage for the time they are with you if you are then there will not be any major fighting yes the roosters will establish who is stronger and better but you will not have any roosters harmed i kept thirteen roosters in one coop once and they all got along with each other but they were with each other since they were chicks now if you are planning to keep the roosters and separate them and then put them back together when they are older you are going to have some problems if you separate them for any time period sometimes even days your roosters will forget each other and start to fight if you do have fighting issues it doesn't necessarily mean that you have to have chicken dinner the rooster will eventually work it out not many roosters will fight to death so you will not have to worry about that unless you are purchasing breeds that are known to fight what you can do if your roosters start to fight is pick them up and put them into cages not together they each must have their own cage this is a time out for them after an hour let them out again if they still continue to fight repeat this it may seem like hard work but one thing it does is work now another thing you may want to consider is that some breeds are calmer then others thus there will be less fighting among them these breeds include the brahma silkie and cochin these breeds do not include jungle fowl leghorns and most bantams the ideal flock numbers are hens per bantam rooster and hens per standard breed rooster good luck  Cock (chicken) Cockfight Capercaillie Guinea pig Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Equine conformation Domesticated turkey Egg (food) Infantilism Friends Factory farming Seabird Roots: The Saga of an American Family Magic (illusion) Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prisoner's dilemma Kodocha True Grit Trapping German Shepherd Dog Cochin (chicken) Extreme Programming Pitaten Phaedo Piccolo Junior Saga Nachman of Breslov God Emperor of Dune Terry Taylor Pysanka Chicken Run Mallard Timon and Pumbaa Father's Day (Doctor Who) Weight training Canary John Cage The Strangerhood Johnny Cage AFI 100 Years series Immortality Apollo 8 Sub-Zero U.S. Acres Firearm Livestock Mixed martial arts YuYu Hakusho Agriculture Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Humphrey Bogart Dog Tenshinhan Hamster Abortion debate Divorce Shaggy dog story Emu Garfield and Friends Hemp Avenue Q The Birds (film) Breastfeeding International League Beagle Bird Battle of the Bulge Kakapo Jack Russell Terrier Contract The Amber Spyglass Ayyavazhi mythology Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus My Little Pony Woman RuneScape quests Mealy Parrot Johnny 5 Meme Domain Name System Time Chaos Emerald Trade union Daylight saving time Vladimir Peter Tytla Luck Maya calendar Philosophy of space and time Dachshund Professional wrestling match types Mobile Fighter G Gundam Whitney Houston Species Megas XLR Scouting

mccaw breeding i have a pair of b g mccaws they are both yrs old the female is tearing up newspaper in the bottom of her cage and also uses a bell on the end of a toy for her sexual pleasure are they to young to set them up for breeding and also what size nest box do they need where is a good site to view nest boxes for them thanks eileen http www petparrot com parrotsupplies htm you'll have to scroll down to view the macaw nest box these are pretty typical but we didn't like this style the size is comparable to a metal garbage can which are also used i built a x x pine box very coffin like with a wire panel in the bottom they chewed it up to their satisfaction and made a beautiful nest complete with babies if both of your macaws have been dna sexed so you're sure they're a breeding pair you could certainly set them up during the breeding cycle however they may become very territorial and even defend the nest against you assuming you are their primary caregiver it can also take them and you a few times to get it right' breeding birds have special diet requirements imbalances can lead to egg eating or eating the young so you'll need to do the research prior to breeding you'll also need to consider what you're going to do with the young keep them handfeed them more research and supplies might be needed if you decide you want to set them up i would see if there's a local breeder that would consider mentoring you through the process especially if you intend to handfeed and sell any babies  Domestic rabbit Hamster Bird House Mouse Chicken Guinea pig Platypus Non-human animal sexuality Peregrine Falcon Albatross Infantilism Equine conformation Bee Dog Pet skunk Oscilloscope Mountain Gorilla Poker jargon Ferret Sexual reproduction Cat CPU cache Ant Quotation mark Nest box Drill bit Species Agriculture HTML element Fancy rat Leatherback Sea Turtle House Sparrow Tooth Koala Honeybee Nutrition Red Squirrel Osprey Milk Seabird Omega-3 fatty acid Compiler optimization Livestock Japanese tea ceremony Amstrad CPC Apple Brolga Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Bobwhite Quail The Origin of Species Red-bellied Macaw Ostrich Solar cell Chinchilla DNA Mealy Parrot Strap-on dildo Drosophila melanogaster Veganism Uniform Resource Locator Emu Hun-Apu Transsexuality Spider Mallard Condor Mosquito RISC Rhea (bird) Orgasm Narcissism Solar power Fusion power Sesame Street Pekingese Garbage collection (computer science) Extreme Programming Kakapo Squirrel Coffin Child sexuality Evidence of evolution Anal sex Falconry Acorn Woodpecker Antarctic krill Zerg Star Trek Customizable Card Game Joy Division (band) Dog agility Sex Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Kitten Macaw Red-cockaded Woodpecker American Alligator

my new cockatiel is months old and it looks like a female but is it my month old cockatiel is colored like many of the pictures i've seen of adult females but is it for sure a female or could it still change coloring to be a male maybe and i am constantly whistleing to it and i whistle the same thing hoping that it will learn i've had it for about weeks and i've been doing it since i've had it and all it does is making a squaking or chirping sound back to me what age would it start whistling if it is able to it has brightish colors in my opinion for only being months old it is gray and has kind of bright orange cheeks and you can tell that the face is yellowish the true colours of a cockateil don't show till the second maulting about mths of age the cheek patch method isn't all that consistant its very hard for someone to know from them if they don't know tiels very well spend mins a day trying to teach it to whistle or talk it generally takes a couple of weeks to come out with its first imitation i found repeptitive thing such as the phone ringing were the first things my tiel learned to imitate when you are training it don't have the tv on or any distracting noises going on in the background so that the only thing the bird is hearing is you and repeat the same thing over and over when you say the tiel is bright doesn't give us much idea of what colour your tiel is is it yellow or white or is it a grey there are many different mutations and not all male tiels have a yellow face  Cockatiel Color Hearing impairment The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Shaggy dog story Kender Color blindness Pitaten Collectibles in Bionicle Horse Reservoir Dogs Dog training Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friends Time Out of Mind AFI 100 Years series Yellow Plame affair Capercaillie Color theory Dragon Booster The Ashlee Simpson Show Jiddu Krishnamurti Great Teacher Onizuka Hair color The Fairly OddParents Humphrey Bogart House Sparrow Lesser Goldfinch Aes Sedai Cro Baroque chess Vegeta Gregorian calendar Television Autism Sonic the Hedgehog Hiberno-English Sant Mat Tin whistle Intelligent design Lauren Bacall The Jazz Singer Marching band Hall & Oates Theory of conduct Douglas Adams Spider Avenue Q Milton H.

my afircan grey help needed i have just bought an africna grey and its been two days it hasnt touched his food i got him fresh fruits and bird food aswell but doesnt want to eat it also i dono how it is as i bought if of a guy who also doesnt know how old it is wen anyone in my family goes towards him he makes this unsual noises and doesnt let anyone touch him he is very quiet i opened his cage and he flew all over the house broke most of the painting and doenst like to comeout of the cage wen its open and sit only at the same spot i want to know if i can make it frendly anyone here can help me out with this as i donno if i am doing anything wrong with it could anyone tell me wat steps to take to make it come out the cage and eat a bit of food as i think he must be starving now hope anyone here had some experice with african greys and could lend me some tips thanks for reading this first of all congratulations on adopting an adult african grey your new companion is one of life's most mysterious birds in fact your companion species has replaced the monkey as next in line to the human in cognitive thinking see the link below about mit dr pepperberg's alex foundation you will need special thinking as well to allow your companion to settle in to his new surroundings since you have just got him this is a good thing no bad habits we need to get back to the basics of support here and i'll start out with the why's he will act like this sitting in one place and not move around much and watch you as he checks out his new location all african greys are naturally apprehensive they do not adapt well to change their fight or flight instinct is very high relax this will take time to adjust next let's look at a few standard issues involved with greys in particular first and foremost is their caging remember their cage should be large enough to strech out their wings in both directions next if you have done this already take out of his cage all of his toys greys need time to adjust to everything and that includes new toys slowly introduce new toys into the same room first put it close by his cage and then move closer to his cage day by day then on top of his cage not attached and then if there is no problem then put in the cage remember slow is the key here do this one step at a time untill you have enough toys to keep your grey active he has a very highly active mind it is important to keep him involved and excersized both mind and body next let's talk about cage location he should be near a window with plenty of direct sunlight they get vitimin d from this and it's manditory for his health it also stimulates his mind to be able to look out and set his natural clock according to the seasons and weather there should be a small spot in the cage when positioned correctly that he can move to in order to get out of the direct sun cage position is very important do not place next to your tv set stereo electronics etc do not place near the front door to your house i don't have any suggestions one way or the other about wing clipping except make sure it is done right the next link is about proper wing clipping and tells you the difference i have some who are clipped and many who are not it all depends on the bird diet is important also your cage should have three bowls and a water bottle first bowl should be a good african grey pellet diet many available such as pretty bird species specific african grey second bowl should contain a little amount of seed large parrot mix you can get at walmart they like to occupy their time cracking seeds peanuts etc and it is a must but don't overdue the amount per day you give him of this cup change out daily the third bowl should be water and placed above this bowl the water bottle you don't know if he is a bottle trained bird so have both available untill he adjusts to the bottle when he does replace this water bowl with fresh food see second link below for diet especially the fresh food i do not reccomend to any cage bird that we use water bowls they are a sourse of disease and bacteria as soon as we get our birds off water bowls the better a water bottle is better because you can keep it clean longer and provides a contious supply of fresh water lastly i wish i could tell you about how much time your african grey will take to adjust but i can't they are highly social birds so it will happen but just not right away there is no replacement or a majic bullet to turn your grey around it just takes patience love all the things alan pointed out above but when your adjustment period is over there is nothing like the love and companionship of a grey the fourth link is from a book by a very good author who has raised many greys she talks at length about their unique charactor and behavior you might want to take this time to read everything you can good luck dutch  Domestic rabbit Social rule Mealy Parrot Fecal incontinence Guinea pig The Time Machine Equine

how do chickens make the shell of the egg what part of a chicken makes the shell of the egg the generalized eggshell structure which varies widely among species is a protein matrix lined with mineral crystals usually of a calcium compound such as calcium carbonate harder eggs are more mineralized than softer eggs as an egg develops within a bird's reproductive system the shell is laid down as a liquid mineral layer around the already formed extraembryonic membranes this takes place in a part of the bird's oviduct which is called the uterus and serves a very different purpose from the uterus of a mammal the shell is laid down by shell glands in an average laying hen the process of shell formation takes around hours pigmentation is added to the shell coloring it any of a variety of colors and patterns depending on species the waxy cuticle is deposited on the shell in the vagina of the bird's oviduct the chick has an egg tooth which it uses to start a hole in the hard eggshell to allow it to hatch  Egg (food) Egg (biology) Sexual reproduction Chicken Mineral Iron Tofu Bird Bone Dinosaur Grasshopper Calcium Tooth enamel Sulfur Leaf Ovulation Carbon Shark Female reproductive system (human) Phosphorus Menstrual cycle Photosynthesis Tooth Vagina Cheese Butterfly Ovum Sodium Nitrogen Carnivorous plant Tuatara Liquid crystal Capercaillie Chlorophyta Digenea Fossil Aluminium Evidence of evolution Titanium Milk Tungsten Bacteria Meiosis Water purification Hydrochloric acid Seabird Mantle (mollusc) Strontium Color Acanthocephala Hard water Nile crocodile Endometrium Pottery Skin Leatherback Sea Turtle Copper Chromium Carbon dioxide The chicken or the egg Diamond Spider Animal communication In vitro fertilisation Calcium in biology Vanadium Cadmium Antarctic krill Vitamin K Sex organ Calcium carbonate Wood Honeybee Cell (biology) Desert Explosive material Weathering Chlorine Drosophila melanogaster Thermoregulation Animal Ecology Krill Cave Solar cell Insulin Manganese Reptile Gold Human skin color Boron

parakeet bites i bought my parakeet about a month ago and always went on my finger now he opens his mouth and tries to jab at my finger as i approach i read some advice about letting them bite your finger yet i am a bit afraid and it always freaks me out how much do parakeet bites hurt is there a better way to tame my parakeet im still trying to bond again with him and work with my parakeet any animal on the planet has a potential to bite and leave a nasty mark and any bite hurts thats why we call it a bite lol it sounds like maybe yes he is hormonal and or you stopped giving him attention with the hand and he has gone wild again which can happen pretty much you have to start all over again once you get him tame again interact with him everyday if he is being that aggressive when you go in the cage then try using a perch to retrieve him out first and be firm with that step up command never grab him with your whole hand and never force him too much to take your finger and never ever use a towel to capture him he may be being territorial too maybe once you get him out to clean his cage rearrange his cage toys etc give him a new cage environment it may help him to stop being territorial take him into a room totaly away from the cage work with him in quiet area if he bites do not make a peep do not scream and do not pull your hand away abruptly rock your hand gently and tell him no show him who is boss you must be flock leader i am hand training my parrotlett and let me tell you that little budgie beak has nothing on my little guys chompers lol be patience be confident with him he will be purring in your hand again soon  Ferret Milton H.

how often does your parakeet eat fruits and veggies we have had our parakeet for about a month now the breeder told us that he liked fruits and veggies especially spinach leafs and all the books we've read said to feed your birds fruits and veggies most said they can live off seed alone but they won't live as long we can't get him to eat anything other than seed so far we have given him cucumbers apples wheat bread steamed peas spinach leafs crackers so far we have given him cucumbers apples wheat bread steamed peas spinach leafs crackers don't give up offer him fresh veggies and or fruit everyday even if he doesn't touch it keep it up eventualy he will discover his veggies and enjoy them it's more important for birds to eat veggies greens high in vitamin a than fruit because fruit is mostly sugar i like to offer my parrotlett mixed frozen veggies with just some hot water run over them so its warm enough for him to enjoy and fresh brocoli as well never leave foods in their cage more than a few hours because bacteria builds up on it and could make him sick offer him a bit of seed but try your best to switch him to pellets because each bite they take is full of the proper vitamins if they eat just seeds its equivalent to us eating potato chips everyday its all fat there are a variety of ways to change his diet but don't force him and take his seeds away all together he will starve research that quietly sit down in front of his cage and gently talk to him sweet and eat some of the food you want him to try and offer it to him from your hand even if he pulls away and refuses it thats normal do this everyday and i bet eventualy once he sees you like it he will try it too when you are eating it show him make noises signaly that it tastes good good luck and i hope it helps don't give up he will come around and come to love the different variety of foods you give him tweettweet  Hamster Cuisine of Denmark Bread Vegetarianism German cuisine Potato Japanese cuisine Breakfast Guinea pig Cuisine of the Philippines Jewish cuisine Chicken Food Tofu Russian cuisine Cuisine of Singapore Domestic rabbit Hot dog Veganism Tomato Ramen Vegetarian cuisine Peanut Bengali cuisine Fancy rat Folic acid Vitamin C Apple Pea Polish cuisine Idli Cuisine of the Southern United States Spinach Soul food Fruit Nutrition Hamburger Yoghurt Food preservation Soup Banana Fecal incontinence Cucumber Cheese Apple pie Dim sum Mealy Parrot Miso Domesticated turkey Organic food In-N-Out Burger Serbian cuisine One Piece minor characters Coriander MRE Cantonese cuisine 613 mitzvot Curry Peruvian cuisine Beer Fish and chips Healthy eating Porridge Sauerkraut Agriculture Dietary fiber Snack food Cereal Alcoholic beverage Garlic Japanese tea ceremony Cajun cuisine Common bean Flour French cuisine Rose Watermelon Antioxidant Pomegranate Pancake Plantain Chile pepper Rice pudding Cuisine of Brazil Fruitarianism Breastfeeding Genetically modified food Cuisine of Greece

does your parakeet do this my somwhat new parakeet kicks his food out of his bowl and gets it everywhere making a huge mess hes not bored though cause hes got plaenty off toys how can i stop him from doing this and why does he do this all of these answers are good birds can kick out their food because of boredom searching for better food or wanting attention but some birds just like to do this it appears to be a game to some of them the rules go something like this kick out large amounts of food squawk for more food look innocent birds are individuals and some are just messy if you give him lots of toys and attention lots of treats and keep his bowl cleaned of husks and he still kicks out food then there may not be much you can do about it you could try only putting in very small amounts of food several times a day if he gets hungry enough because he kicked out his food a couple of hours ago he will eat first and kick out second later hopefully he might eventually learn to conserve his food but i wouldn't bet cash money on it good luck  Piccolo Junior Saga Betting (poker) The Amazing Race EastEnders Garfield Craps Theory of conduct National Football League Japanese tea ceremony Ken Jennings Make money fast Video game music Game show Shaggy dog story Slot machine Press Your Luck Hamster Little Britain Super Bowl XXXVIII Big Brother UK series 6 Super Bowl XXXVI Play Your Cards Right Ron Weasley The Apprentice 2 Binge eating disorder Falconry Spider Budgerigar Quizbowl Famine Let's Make a Deal Social rule Bulk vending Canary Sydney Riot of 1879 Parrot Chopsticks Texas hold 'em Pittsburgh Steelers Gambling Conure Rose-ringed Parakeet Discworld gods Brewery Dog training MapleStory New York Giants Dairy Chinese New Year Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl I Terry Bogard Kibbutz Super Bowl XXXI Winning Streak Jeopardy!

i feed the birds in my backyard and lately a couple of cats have been hanging around i found some feathers on the ground the other day how can i get rid of these cats without bringing them any harm irresponsible animal owners who allow their cats to roam free are a major problem domestic cats are not a part of nature and they are responsible for the killing of countless wild birds if you know who owns the cats talk to them about keeping their cats inside but don't expect a very kind response most people who allow their cats to run free believe that the cat can't be happy indoors and that it has no major impact on wildlife if you are lucky enough to live in a municipality where there is a leash law for cats as well as dogs report the cats to animal control if not you can try to catch them and take them to a shelter or you can try to chase them any time you see them in your yard you can clap your hands and yell or you can use a hose or a super soaker on them but cats being predatory by nature will keep coming back as long as there are birds there to prey upon  Cat Ferret Feral cat Dog Hunting Domestic rabbit Phantom cat RuneScape quests Fox hunting Kakapo Tyrannosaurus rex Pet skunk Tick Gray Wolf Bird strike Domestication Trapping Working animal Feral Housebreaking Puma Cheetah Animal rights Spider Bat Tiger Hamster Piccolo Junior Saga H5N1 Manx (cat) Domestic violence Animal communication Obedience training Tag Gerald Durrell Rabbit Lion People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Theory of conduct Garfield Livestock House Pet Skunk Tasmanian Devil Shaggy dog story Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Joker (comics) Fancy rat Dinosaur Caracal Glossary of American football Domesticated turkey Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Felix the Cat Biological pest control Marching band Microchip implant (animal) Rabies The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Shannara creatures Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Introduced species Brown Bear Richard Chase Carnivore American Alligator Canary Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Kevin and Kell Oliver and Company Gun politics Zoo Viva La Bam Sheikh Abdullah Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Volleyball Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bird of prey Foie gras Chicken Mutts Orca The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Rocko's Modern Life Holocene extinction event Asiatic Golden Cat Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pittsburgh Steelers Hedgehog Redbone Coonhound Albatross Minor Harry Potter Beasts

bird cages i noticed today my old cage has horizontal bars where as my new cage they are vertical which is better will my lovebird get its head caught in the vertical bars the sides of the cage are all vertical why don't they make some sides horizontal as a law horizontal are better as parrots love to climb generally cages have horizontal sides vertical edit vertical bars are usually for hanging stuff if your bird can climb the cage without any problems it's perfectly fine this horizontal vs vertical bars cages come with all horizontal bars all vertical bars and combinations of the two vertical bars provide strong support especially for the heavy tops of larger cages and are preferred for the front which should have a large door opening in it openings for feeder doors and breeder boxes are shorter if they are placed among horizontal bars in a cage they create less disturbance to the structure horizontal bars also make climbing and attaching dishes perches and toys easier when choosing a larger cage try to get one with at least some vertical bars for strength and stability a combination of both vertical and horizontal is a good choice many cages are made with vertical fronts and backs and horizontal sides  Equine conformation Bicycle frame Trapping Door Wind turbine Seismic retrofit Glossary of climbing terms Fixed-wing aircraft Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Domestic rabbit Antenna (radio) Dog agility Fancy rat Sailing Window Batting (cricket) Aerial (dance move) Oscilloscope Mealy Parrot Stairway Strap-on dildo Golf club (equipment) Palatine bone Hangul Anamorphic widescreen Skateboarding trick Doom engine Textile manufacturing Maxilla Mixed martial arts Microeconomics Horizontal bar Cloud Knitting Ship Professional wrestling aerial techniques Helicopter Autogyro Suspension bridge 19-inch rack Imperial (automobile) Dentures Drawing Steel Cage Match Mountaineering Lung Chess strategy and tactics Table saw Gramophone record Fast bowling View camera Rugby union positions RuneScape quests Radar Electric motor Recumbent bicycle Professional wrestling throws Airport Drill bit Rib IMAX Breaststroke Gas metal arc welding Glider Light-frame construction Crane (machine) Xiangqi Ford Thunderbird Backstroke Barbed wire Professional wrestling match types M4 Sherman San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Egyptian language International Phonetic Alphabet Rapid transit Vowel Punt (boat) Car safety Ferret Piano NTSC Poker jargon Volleyball Polarization Flag of the People's Republic of China Jet engine Anchor Flag of the United States Arcade cabinet The Time Machine Cello Chinchilla Paragliding Lawn mower Amateur telescope making

is it normal for cockatiels to i just got a cockatiel from a nearby petstore and brought it home two days ago it's six months old and i don't think it's every really been in a cage i think it's scared of me because it always shakes as if it's frightened i've gotten it to eat food but it wont drink any water also it wont move from the spot i put it in i put it on it's food perch and it doesnt move unless i move it is this normal for a new bird how can i make it feel more comfortable and also what temperature should the bird be in you should never do anything with a bird other than feed it and water it for at least the first hours after the bird comes to your house playing with them before then causes them so much stress that they go hypoglycemic and can actually die if the bird is not drinking you need to take it to the vet asap because birds can't go very long without water a way to tell if the bird is drinking is to put some red food coloring in the water check her the next day and if the feathers under her beak are red she's drinking but if they're not then there's a problem usually scared birds wont let you touch them so if this one is scared and letting you near it there is most likely a problem probably due to stress if the bird is drinking wait a few days without touching it or doing anything other than feeding and watering it if the bird isn't any better get some anti stress medication homeo pet d stress anxiety is the best in my opinion and see if there's a change the best temperature for a bird is degrees but some are okay at or so just see what temp your bird likes you can get a heating pad and if the bird is over with it all the time then she's cold if you have any other questions feel free to let me know  Chicken Hypoglycemia Fancy rat Dog Capercaillie Cockatiel Bird Thermoregulation Mealy Parrot Kakapo Hamster Guinea pig Sorghum Anxiety Falconry Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hyperthermia RuneScape quests Urinary incontinence Stuttering Discus (fish) Seabird Housebreaking Temperature Cat Vitamin C Upholstery Alcoholism Carbon dioxide Chocolate Combat stress reaction Fecal incontinence Friends Domestic rabbit Hyperglycemia Canary Parrot Breastfeeding Atomic Kitten Poker jargon Hansel und Gretel Salad Fingers Stomach cancer Milton H.

does a chicken have to be broody before it sits on eggs i have chickens and i was wondering if i could put a few furtile eggs in there nest box and see if they will sit on them but i thought they would have to go broody first please help first of all make sure that your hens are broody breeds some chickens will never have chicks because it was breed out of them go to this website it is a chart that tells you all about the breeds of chickens http www ithaca edu staff jhenderson chooks chooks html then if you find that your chickens will go broody remember that the hen goes broody because of a hormonal change so when she goes broody depends on her body which will be different for each and every hen even if they are the same breed and age a good way to determine when a hen will go broody is to look at her stomach if she has lost most of her feathers down there then she will soon be going broody this is so that she can keep her eggs warmer because they will be in contact with her skin instead of all the feathers the body supplies the heat and her feathers hold it in also remember that hens that will not go broody also will lose their stomach feathers before you stick some eggs under your hen make sure that she is broody first if you do it the other way around the hen will most likely not take the eggs you will know when this happens your hen will fluff up and screech at you when you come to collect her eggs she will also stay on the nest night and day she will get of off the nest for about an hour each day to eat and go to the bathroom when she gets like this she is broody and ready for the fertile eggs if she isn t acting like this she isn t broody and she will not take the eggs what to do with the eggs fertile eggs should be kept around degrees if they are kept in degree temp or under the egg will die if they are kept at degrees the chick will start to develop and die later on because it hasn t been turned humidity went wrong or something else happened so make sure that the eggs are kept at the right temp also remember that fertility rates drop to basically nothing if the eggs are older then days what to do if the hen accepts the eggs give them to her and wait days for the chicks to hatch make sure other hens can t lay their eggs when the broody hen is you do not want her sitting on two many eggs make sure that she isn t sitting on to large of a nest if you wish to incubate keep eggs at degrees turn them three times a day until day after day do not turn them any longer keep the humidity constant at good luck  Capercaillie Emu Kakapo Albatross Egg (food) Bird Seabird Condor Cock (chicken) Leatherback Sea Turtle Domesticated turkey Osprey Factory farming Kodocha Platypus Snake Peregrine Falcon Species Anopheles RuneScape economy Tawny Frogmouth The chicken or the egg Thermoregulation Theory of conduct Bird migration Mallard Bobwhite Quail Malleefowl Dinosaur Nile crocodile Salmon Rhea (bird) House Sparrow World Wide Web American Robin Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bee American Alligator Livestock Friends Aerial (dance move) Archery The Shining (film) Mattress The Power of One Brolga Musk Duck Balut Boom Town (Doctor Who) Minor Harry Potter Beasts Mercury Atlas 6 Cochin (chicken) Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Easter Island Mound-builders Laysan Albatross Omega-3 fatty acid Goldfish Life in the Freezer Agriculture The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Inside Zerg Emperor Penguin Endometrium Falconry Cantonese cuisine U.S. Acres MRE God Emperor of Dune Pink Pigeon Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Extreme Programming The Amber Spyglass African Fish Eagle Flea Prairie Falcon Coconut crab Sea turtle Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Honeybee Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Clownfish Fertility awareness Cuisine of the Philippines Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Veganism Poker jargon Cat

what do you about with a cockatiels boo boo i have to agree with dramaqueen what kind of boo boo a small scratch may just require a good antibiotic ointment but even something as seemingly small as a drop of blood from a hurt toenail can be serious enough to require a visit to the vet if bleeding does not stop immediately you need to apply some corn starch or flour to staunch the blood flow and immediately get the bird to the vet birds have such a small amount of blood that even the loss of several drops can be deadly if the boo boo means that he seems to be favoring a leg or wing then try to determine if is seems serious or not if it is serious get him to the vet if you cannot tell get him to the vet the little bird depends upon you please don't let him down  Ferret Bleeding Blood Dialysis Professional wrestling slang Tourniquet Callus Shock Stroke Intravenous therapy Equine conformation Bird Blood pressure Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Guinea pig DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Philadelphia Phillies Folic acid Flour First aid Randomness DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Jet engine Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Stopping power Pneumonia Coeliac disease DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Nutrition Eczema First aid kit Fancy rat Cockatiel Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Hypoglycemia Electrophysiology Drug test Traumatic brain injury DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Poker jargon Needle aspiration biopsy Philadelphia Eagles Chicken Psoriasis Diseases of the honeybee Wheat Free trade Wound Teen Girl Squad Glass Stomach cancer Myocardial infarction Blood (computer game) Functional magnetic resonance imaging Pressure point Wind turbine Kosher foods Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Antibiotic Potato Aerial (dance move) Subdural hematoma Bloodstain pattern analysis Veterans Stadium Boo.com Brewery Tick Microeconomics Fecal incontinence Alcoholic beverage Beer Theory of conduct Capitalism Carbon dioxide Goodness and value theory Bread Armored Core Staining (biology) Cirrhosis Piccolo Junior Saga Pretty Good Privacy Athenian democracy Reynolds number Von Willebrand disease Tennis Cereal Suicide methods To Kill a Mockingbird Group A streptococcal infection Inflation Cancer Skateboarding trick Mosquito Chlorpromazine Baseball Axial compressor Compiler optimization Rice

help i may be getting either a budgie or a weero cockatiel and don't know anything about birds can someone give me advice on the basics of looking after them diet cage vet visits training etc just an outline would be great don't confuse me with to much jargon also it would be hand reared and i already have dogs and cats so would it be ok for the bird to be outdoors or indoors but only in it's cage thanks permanently outdoors isn't a good idea usually the bird has to be kept warm and away from drafts or it'll get sick feed them a mixture of pellets and seeds either kaytee fiesta because it's already mixed and has the fresh fruit that birds need or mix kaytee rainbow pellets with a seed diet because a seed diet will cause them to get fatty liver disease the cage needs to be at least as wide as twice the bird's wingspan bigger is always better take the bird to the vet right away to make sure it has no diseases or other problems but other than that you only have to take it to the vet once a year or so for a check up birds don't show signs of being sick until they're about ready to die so as soon as you see symptoms of illness take it to the vet asap it's best if you can play with the bird outside of the cage also because it makes them happy and live longer just take it into a room with no other animals this is especially important for hand raised babies because they're used to being held and played with so if you take that away from them they may actually get depressed it really depends upon what you want to train your bird to do but here's a great website with tons of training advice http www cockatootrainer com i hope this wasn't too long or confusing if you have more questions feel free to let me know  Guinea pig Hamster Fancy rat Chicken Ferret Dog Hypoglycemia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hedgehog Livestock Vitamin C Pet skunk Garfield Cat Alcoholism Stomach cancer Poker jargon Folic acid Nutrition Medicine Breastfeeding Housebreaking Prostate cancer Cirrhosis Coeliac disease Bread Vegetarianism Foodborne illness Foie gras Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Shrimp farm First aid Tai shogi Agriculture Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Randomness Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Kashrut Theory of conduct Traumatic incident reduction The Catcher in the Rye The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Clinical depression Sleep Equine conformation Soap Raw food diet Kakapo Decompression sickness Species Chronic fatigue syndrome Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tobacco smoking Care Bears Current teachings of Prem Rawat Diabetes mellitus Fatty acid Mealy Parrot Weight training RuneScape quests Colorectal cancer Tocopherol Capercaillie World Wide Web Fecal incontinence Multiple sclerosis Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Stroke Shotgun Domain Name System Albatross Archery Atkins Nutritional Approach Irritable bowel syndrome Bird Cannabis (drug) In-N-Out Burger Little Britain Coronary heart disease Banana Fasting Oily fish Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Microchip implant (animal) Cancer Disease Mixed martial arts Apple Falconry The Emancipation of Mimi Pretty Good Privacy Aspartame Kodocha Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Lighting

do you know who killed the dodos if yes who people did here is the wikipedia discription of why they are extinct as with many animals evolving in isolation from significant predators the dodo was entirely fearless of people and this in combination with its flightlessness made it easy prey but journals are full of reports regarding the bad taste and tough meat of the dodo while other local species such as the red rail were praised for their taste it is commonly believed that the malay sailors held the bird in high regard and killed them only to make head dressings used in religious ceremonies however when humans first arrived on mauritius they also brought with them other animals that had not existed on the island before including dogs pigs cats rats and crab eating macaques which plundered the dodo nests while humans destroyed the forests where the birds made their homes currently the impact these animals especially the pigs and macaques had on the dodo population is considered to have been more severe than that of hunting the expedition's finds are apparently of animals killed by a flash flood such mass mortalities would have further jeopardized an already extinction prone species although there are scattered reports of mass killings of dodos for provisioning of ships archaeological investigations have hitherto found scant evidence of human predation on these birds some bones of at least two dodos were found in caves at baie du cap which were used as shelters by fugitive slaves and convicts in the th century but due to their isolation in high broken terrain were not easily accessible to dodos naturally by cossigny reports that the number of refugees and settlers which cut down the inland forest was so high that the well flighted mauritius blue pigeon was rapidly declining all over the island citation needed there is some controversy surrounding the extinction date of the dodo roberts solow state that the extinction of the dodo is commonly dated to the last confirmed sighting in reported by shipwrecked mariner volkert evertsz evertszoon but many other sources suggest the more conjectural date roberts solow point out that because the sighting prior to was in the dodo was likely already very rare by the s and that thus a disputed report from cannot be dismissed off hand statistical analysis of the hunting records of issac johannes lamotius carried out by julian hume and coworkers citation needed give a new estimated extinction date of with a confidence interval of to considering more circumstantial evidence such as travellers' reports and the lack of good reports after it is likely that the dodo became extinct before thus the last dodo died barely more than a century after the species' discovery in http en wikipedia org wiki dodo extinction good luck  Extinct birds Holocene extinction event Island restoration Seabird Kakapo Bird Fauna of Australia Mascarene Islands Whaling Gerald Durrell Extinction Cat Dinosaur Tiger Dog Oceania ecozone Easter Island Blue Whale Biodiversity of New Zealand Dromornithidae Introduced species Prehistoric Britain Stone Age Fox hunting Biodiversity Orca Tyrannosaurus rex Feral cat Tasmanian Devil Hunting Olduwan Brown Bear Red Deer Permian-Triassic extinction event Indigenous Australians Extinction event The Voyage of the Beagle Evidence of evolution Endangered species Albatross Peleliu Shark Europe Ivory-billed Woodpecker Flightless bird Archaeology and the Book of Mormon Vitamin C Guns, Germs, and Steel Flood geology Christmas Island Human Bigfoot Kiwi RuneScape quests Coconut crab Andaman Islands Shifting cultivation Meme Fishing Neanderthal Hern__n Cort__s Richard Owen Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Species Inuit The Origin of Species Population history of American indigenous peoples Meat Lion Ecoregions of Madagascar Southeast Asia Australasia ecozone Plesiosaur Animal testing Creatures in Bionicle Leopard The Skeptical Environmentalist New Zealand Mammal Paleocene Animal communication Yellowstone National Park Noah's Ark Francis Light Inaccessible Island Aquatic ape hypothesis Spider Leatherback Sea Turtle R__union Sacred Ibis Capercaillie Cannibalism

cockateil problem hi there can anyone tell me how long it takes feathers to grow i rescued my cockateil months ago from a bad enviroment within the first few months her feathers were growing back lovely but now they seem to have stopped and look terrible again i dont think she is pulling them out herself as i havnt seen her doing it but she is looking dreadfull i have tried tonics etc in her water is this normal and how long does it normally take for them to recover or will they ever thanks there could be many problems causing this i would suggest you first take the bird to the vet to determine if there is anything physically wrong with it mites or vitamin deficiency are possible causes that the vet should be able to identify if there are no physical causes then it may be stress rescue birds can take a long time to fully recover from their bad experiences they need extra time and patience spend lots of time with your bird give it good healthy treats praise it and tell it what a good bird it is in time it will come to trust you and the stress should lessen good luck  Guinea pig Folic acid Tocopherol Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Diseases of the honeybee RuneScape quests Vitamin C Color Chronic fatigue syndrome Urinary incontinence Hypoglycemia Coeliac disease 2000 Australian Grand Prix Dinosaur Anorexia nervosa Piccolo Junior Saga Garfield Domestic rabbit Controversies in autism Multiple sclerosis Cancer Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prostate cancer Seabird Stomach cancer Psoriasis Dog Anemia Equine conformation The Contender (television series) Thermoregulation Carpal tunnel syndrome Scientology beliefs and practices Post-traumatic stress disorder Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Bipolar disorder Fancy rat Dissociative identity disorder Alcoholics Anonymous Chicken Pitaten Church of Christ, Scientist Randomness Growth hormone treatment Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Clinical depression Menstrual cycle Animal rights Vitamin D Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Final Fantasy magic Nutrition Non-native pronunciations of English Mattress Utilitarianism Albatross Characters in the Smurfs Marathon (sport) Unemployment Theory of conduct Haibane Renmei National Kidney Foundation Singapore Jet engine Ferret Vitamin Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fitz Hugh Ludlow Insulin Mental illness Rastafari movement Human adaptation to space Alzheimer's disease Species Growth hormone deficiency John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Paget's disease of bone Chlorpromazine Swimming Osteoporosis Traumatic incident reduction Atherosclerosis Meat Loaf Speed of light Inflation Current teachings of Prem Rawat EastEnders Diabetes mellitus Pneumonia Oh My Goddess!

has anyone ever seen a baby pigeon before i go to new york city all the time and i've only seen adults and not one nest in sight strange i've seen a ton of them but then again i raise pigeons the reason you don't see them in the wild is because they stay in the nest the whole time hidden from predators including you until they are ready to fly away and be independent baby pigeons don't just lay about on the ground open to the elements and attack they are warm and safe in a well hidden nest until they are completely feathered sometimes you might see a fledgeling a baby pigeon that has all it's feathers and is learning to fly but you probably wouldn't even recognize it because it would look just like an adult the only time you would ever see a baby would be if it fell out of the nest and i would hope you put it back or if you raise pigeons like i do  Capercaillie Bird Kakapo Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dodo Dove Rock Dove RuneScape quests AFI 100 Years series Emu Seabird Ostrich Comanche Band-tailed Pigeon Domesticated turkey Dinosaur Gray Wolf Albatross Aerial (dance move) Tyrannosaurus rex Shen Gong Wu Magical objects in Harry Potter Pink Pigeon European Nightjar Young adult literature Passenger Pigeon Auk Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Chicken Condor Penguin Paragliding Frankie Laine Naruto jutsu Combine (Half-Life 2) First Battle of the Atlantic Kereru The Amber Spyglass Pidgeotto Ant Squirrel Extinct birds Gharial Pok__mon Abilities Chocobo Rook (bird) Burrhus Frederic Skinner Boba Fett Breastfeeding Tarantula Jon Secada Sesame Street Bird flight USS Zane (DD-337) Worms weapons and tools Pompadour Green Pigeon Peafowl Bald Eagle Nile crocodile The Curse of Fenric American Alligator House Sparrow Toa Azaria Chamberlain disappearance European Kingfisher Characters in the Smurfs Miami-Dade County Public Schools Bart the Mother Pidgey Confidence trick Mario Prairie Falcon Peregrine Falcon Pikmin The Death Gate Cycle Friends Leatherback Sea Turtle Common Raven Dog Avenue Q Mark I (tank) USS Seadragon (SS-194) Poker jargon God Emperor of Dune Discus (fish) Pigeonhole principle Spotted Dove USS Valley Forge (CV-45) King of Fighters John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Hamster Achtung Baby Rayman Gerald Durrell Peter Pan Baby Blues Cliff Richard USS Thresher (SS-200) Infantilism Unreal

i found a baby bird i found a baby bird that fell from its nest it is still alive but when i found it it was twitching and had ants all over it i managed to remove all the ants the mother was still in the nest but wasnt doing anything for some reason so i took it in for care i don't know what to do ive been trying to feed it but it wont open its mouth what can i do to help it survive contact a licensed wildlife rehabilitator immediately you can find one here http www tc umn edu devo contact htm please under no circumstances attempt to care for the baby bird yourself there is so much more to rehabilitation than keeping the animal alive until you think it is ready to be released you have to know not only what to feed the bird but how please do not attempt to give the bird any liquid by dropper baby birds can aspirate and die how much and how often you also have to know how to assess the birds general health and condition a baby bird kept in captivity must be taught to recognize and find the type of food it will eat in the wild if it is being hand fed it may not associate the bugs and berries and seeds in nature as being food it must also have the opportunity to exercise its wings a lot so it will be able to fly on or shortly after release when i volunteered at the avian rehabilitation center we kept the rehabilitating fledglings in a large walk in cage with lots of shelves and branches leading from one shelf to the other and down to the ground we would place different types of food in the cage for them as they were being weaned from the hand feeding formula we offered seed meal worms and chopped up fruit no fledgling was released until it was eating on its own had sufficient weight gain had all of its flight feathers in good condition had no sign of diarreah or nasal discharge had clear eyes and could fly at least a few feet in a straight line these are the reasons to get the bird to a licensed rehabilitator they have the training and the resources necessary to do all this in addition to having the permits to do it all legally all native migratory birds in the us are protected under the migratory bird treaty act and you must have the proper permits to have them even for a short time even for good reasons like saving them many other countries also have similar laws regarding their native species  Hamster Chicken Breastfeeding Falconry Kakapo Bird Seabird Albatross Domestic rabbit Cat Bird migration Hunting Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Pet skunk Capercaillie Mealy Parrot Ant Terri Schiavo Acorn Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Livestock Species Guinea pig Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong H5N1 Bird ringing Foie gras Elephant Bat Peafowl Insect Genetically modified food Insulin Vegetarianism Hemp Bee Dinosaur Ivory-billed Woodpecker Mosquito Orca Diabetes mellitus Kashrut Tetrapod Animal testing Extinction Peregrine Falcon Tasmanian Devil Condor Hedgehog Poker jargon Ferret Shrimp farm Airport Dog agility Fancy rat Hummingbird Fish farming Mountain Gorilla Agriculture Bird flight Peanut Gliding Insurance Fauna of Australia Spider Nurse Dodo Nile crocodile GNU General Public License Canary Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 Comanche Trapping Sewage treatment Towra Point Nature Reserve Domesticated turkey Angling Trademark Salad Fingers Scientology beliefs and practices International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement Public domain Maize Red imported fire ant Gypsy moth Vermicompost Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology American Alligator American Black Bear Ostrich Life in the Freezer Gray Wolf

underweight quaker hi ok so this is an extension to my previous question i have an gram quaker parrot he is a male and and a half years old i do think he has a slightly low appetite and for one i was wondering if you really think he is underweight here is what he eats has access to previously he mainly ate seed treats occasional pasta sometimes rowdybush now he eats has access to peas rice chicken seed rowdybush bread vitaflight vitamin i have been concerned about this and his diet change has only taken place in the past few days i need to know if i should be very worried and what i should do what should i feed him to make him gain weight should i try giving him some formula i am currently in the process of sprouting foods for him but it will take a few days before they sprout what should i do i need an honest and prefferably experienced answer not just someone who read an article off of google best answers will be treated with ten points the average weight for quakers can range from to gr so he's only just under weight you can also get many birds around that are under the 'normal' weight range but are completley healthy take for instance my ekkie he's a lean machine underweight but very healthy just a littlie you should try offering him a little more variety of fruit veg these are always good for parrots although most love peas are ok to have peas you can easily over do it with giving peas they're high in sugar so add other rich grean red yellow orange fruit veg as well i personally do not agree that any parrot owner should ever give their parrot a vit sup unless their vet requests them to do so i see you have a vit sup plus pellets pellets the correct ones already contain the right amount of vit sups by adding to this extra vit sups you're only over doing it this can lead to health problems too did you weigh him before changing his diet what was his previous diet if this is a sudden change it is not always wise to do this parrots can react badly to sudden change diets it's always best to do the diet change over a period several weeks to months depending on the change taking place sprouting is alway excellent beleiev it or not yet another vit sup i would most def take away those vitaflight your quaker is gonna end up with a vit min overload for some ideas on foods types of fruit veg to use etc you can check this out it is an eclectus diet website but it has a great variety of the fruit veg you cna choose from plus nutritional info on nuts seeds plus what common garden flowers you can offer cooked foods etc plus an idea for sprouting too these aren't what i found on the net they're my websites  Folic acid Atkins Nutritional Approach Food Vegetarianism Dieting Guinea pig Veganism Domestic rabbit Vitamin C Hamster Raw food diet Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Omega-3 fatty acid Stomach cancer Peanut Nutrition Tocopherol Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Obesity Hypoglycemia Bread Cuisine of Denmark Mealy Parrot Healthy eating Tomato Agriculture Milk Ramen Anorexia nervosa Food guide pyramid Chocolate Adjustable gastric band Dietary fiber Coeliac disease Acorn Vegetarian nutrition Coronary heart disease Potato Pasta German cuisine Farthing (coin) Famine Egg (food) Common bean Tofu Super Size Me Jewish cuisine Rice Organic food Cuisine of the Philippines Chicken Weight training South Beach diet Tooth Maize Soul food Cuisine of the Southern United States Flowering plant Fruit MyPyramid Bengali cuisine Pet skunk Breakfast British cuisine Food preservation Microeconomics Dairy Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Consensus decision-making Nut (fruit) Explosive material Handloading Antioxidant Roman eating and drinking Equine conformation Childbirth CPU cache Pea Hamburger MRE Kashrut Glycemic index Body mass index Kakapo Cancer Apple Sprouting Miso

can you keep a diamond dove parakeet in the same cage every bird is different and it depends on if they can get along with each other it's possible but not likely i have a male eclectus and a femal african grey and they just tolerate each other but they do try to get into litlle fights now and then but then i know of a female eclectus and a cat that are inseperable so really you'll just have to see how well they can get along with each other over a couple of months before you consider putting them in the same cage  Monk Parakeet Conure Jason Reso Lion Red Squirrel John Cage Red-masked Parakeet Parrot Extinct birds Tigon Cuttlefish StarrCade Canary Seabird Dove African Grey Parrot Professional wrestling match types Bird Rose-ringed Parakeet TNA Lockdown Domestic rabbit Carolina Parakeet Kakapo Ostrich Liger Panthera hybrid War Eagle Non-human animal sexuality Alexandrine Parakeet Professional wrestling aerial techniques Sea Otter Tweety Bird Plum-headed Parakeet Diving suit Peafowl Jamar Shipman The Great American Bash Red Phalarope Jerry Herman African Mourning Dove Feral cat La Cage aux Folles Chris Kanyon Newton's Parakeet Conifer cones Crow Chris Harris (wrestler) Days of our Lives Hamster Trapping Alcoholism Ruff Sibley-Monroe checklist 6 Hybrid Kiwi Mixed martial arts Johnny Cage Pet Group sex Interracial couple House Mouse Northern Pintail Clash of Champions Wilson's Phalarope Ferret Red-necked Phalarope Nile crocodile Auk Northern Cardinal Onomatopoeia Sexual selection Magic (illusion) Budgerigar Guinea pig Devil Fruit Tai shogi Sibley-Monroe checklist 4 Pet store Ric Flair Fancy rat Dai dai shogi Paul Wight Penguin Spider Diving cylinder Mountain Gorilla Nikita Koloff Spotted Dove Cheetah Bicycle frame Philosophy of language Rufous Hummingbird Sexual dimorphism Lactose intolerance RuneScape quests Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Guns, Germs, and Steel Breath of Fire III Guadeloupe Streptopelia

what if i found a bird outside an dit was hurt and i take it inside well i was wondering if i toke a bird inside that was like gonna be eaten by a cat and was scared and couldn't fly yet cause it was a baby and i put it in my house and i raised it and when it gets older or after i take care of it and stuff should i keep it or is it not a house bird should i put it back outside cause i want a bird and i am thinking of catching one outside but i don t know if i should and plus i do have that bird still i don't know what i should do i want to keep it but i got it from the wild is it better if i buy one what if i do keep the bird both you and the bird can be severely hurt unless you are very aware of what you are doing if you attempt to help a wild bird you must keep in mind that it is meant to be wild you could quietly watch from a distance of at least feet to see if the mother is nearby look around for a nest that may have fallen from a tree sometimes older birds watch the young while they forage on the ground and check on them periodically it is very difficult to help a wild bird especially if it is injured you would have to find someone near you who has tried this hopefully a wildlife professional or an academic and consult with them before you even think of approaching the bird birds can die of fright the bird is probably frightened already and there is a chane you could tip the balance in the wrong direction whatever you do it is a very bad idea to think of taking it in as a pet although a wild bird may become tame if taken in it will not be domesticated like the birds you can buy in a pet shop if you want a bird as a pet you should go to a pet store the best discussion i've seen about this on the web is at a site about european starlings one of the people at the site was trained as a federal wildlife rehabber in the us and she discusses the real life problems of taking a bird inside and later trying to release it so it can survive or the alternatives although it can be rewarding it requires constant attention and carries a risk of heartbreaking failure the one experience i had although initially sucessful was emotionally draining and the long term survival of the bird i rescued is still in doubt like all birds in the wild it is always at risk here are some statistics only one robin in lives to be a year old although their lifespan can excede years and only of grackles live to be adults  Domestic rabbit Hamster Ferret Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kakapo Dog Feral cat The Inside Cat Introduced species Neopets Fancy rat Shaggy dog story Domestic violence Surveillance Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hunting Guinea pig Wind power Platypus Piccolo Junior Saga Jon Secada Seabird Archery Scientology beliefs and practices Milton H.

gray pigeon eggs my pigeons layed four eggs on july one egg's shell was too weak and cracked i cleaned up the nest then three more eggs were layed the other three survived it takes days avg for eggs to hatch i should be expecting them any moment soon the last egg layed turned a light gray ish color i know this because the last egg was significantly bigger than the other two what does this mean is it still alive or not does it mean it will hatch already i live in laredo texas it's usually hot in here but this summer it has been raining practically all summer long luckily my pigeons seem to never leave the nest the climate is finally stabilizing and we have hot days now if you need more information please ask so okay first if you have four eggs in the nest and if those are the only pigeons you have you won't raise babies you have two hens mated together pigeons lay two eggs if you have four both hens laid second if you have other birds in the loft including males then the chances are that the other three eggs are fertile the gray look is often an indication that the embryo is developing the larger egg can be one of two things it might be a double yolked egg if it's really large if that's the case the chances of a successful hatch from it are on the order of in a thousand it could also be that one hen laid that one and the other laid the other two if you do hatch three squeakers be careful if the hens are able to rear them past the soft food stage then they will need extra feed to enable them to carry all three to weaning good luck  Chicken Egg (food) Egg (biology) Bird Emu Leatherback Sea Turtle Platypus Kakapo Ostrich Shark Bee Queen bee In vitro fertilisation American lobster Krill Salmon Nile crocodile Coconut crab Sexual reproduction Peregrine Falcon Capercaillie Clownfish Beetle Gypsy moth Octopus Pregnancy Paper wasp Pysanka Dragons (Pern) Seabird American Alligator Rock Dove Head louse Aphid Tank Eggshell Sea-Monkey Ant Mallard Antarctic krill Ladybird Xenomorph Monogamy Pok__mon Abilities Burrhus Frederic Skinner The chicken or the egg Breastfeeding American Robin Twin Musk Duck Sexual dimorphism Kereru Pink Pigeon Frog Tarantula Infertility Ovum Sea star Life in the Freezer Sea turtle Combine (Half-Life 2) Polychrotidae Rhea (bird) Bird migration Cockroach Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Tuatara Zerg Africanized bee Condor Grasshopper Factory farming House Sparrow Flowering plant Minor Harry Potter Beasts Metroid (video game species) Tofu Emperor Penguin Bagworm moth Bobwhite Quail Homing pigeon Biological pest control Poker jargon Abortion debate Mantis shrimp Gharial Hamster Morphogenesis Omega-3 fatty acid Batoidea Tilapia Battle of Jutland Embryogenesis Housefly

how to handraise birds some of my zebra finches escaped i feel terrible they left behind babies they have not fledged yet but they have all their feathers so far i've had them for a day and a night i'm at least trying to keep them alive instead of just leaving them here's what i'm doing please tell me if i'm doing it okay or if i'm completely wrong i have no experience with this sort of thing i feed them once every hours i'm using avione hand rearing formula they are in a shoe box with the lid open a crack there is paper towel and a tea towel on the bottom and they are in a plastic container with tissues and feathers i put a shot glass of water in there for humidity or whatever not sure if it's working after phoning pet stores a pharmacy a vet and an electrical store i had no luck finding a heat pad so i put the shoe box on my electric blanket with the setting on low continued in additional notes mixed part with parts boiling water then after a few minutes test it on my wrist i don't have a thermometer i should buy one i'm not really sure exactly how hot it should be so i guess i bought cc tuberculin syringes they don't have anything attached to them couldn't find anything like that i'm too scared that i'll drown the poor things by squirting a ton in their mouth and getting it wrong so i do a bit at a time they grab the nozzle and swallow it sort of and i squirt it in what i'm really not sure is when to stop feeding them what does a suitably full crop look like at the moment i'm just guessing and really don't know then i clean up any spilt mixture so that it doesn't harden on their beaks or face i didn't feed them during the night i stopped at about or pm and started again at am is that okay i hand raised a zebra finch chick about the same age in similar circumstances years ago i still have him and he is an absolute delight he has the personality of any hand raised parrot and loves to have his head and neck scratched as others have said you are doing fine i had raised numerous species of parrots before this finch but i was also very nervous due to his small size mine also swallowed the pipette which was really alarming and frightening at first but is apparently normal for them i used the same criteria for the crop as i did with parrots feed to the point of a slightly firm bulge but not to where it feels hard or tight it's always better to err on the side of feeding slightly less but more frequently then to over extend the crop the crop will shrink as they near fledgling age if your three turn out like mine did you will have some very special zebra finches you really get a unique view of their true personality when they are hand fed good luck with them  Shaggy dog story Kakapo Equine conformation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Thermal power station Chicken Dairy Drill bit Breastfeeding Poker jargon EastEnders Fire fighting Japanese toilet Tyrannosaurus rex Piccolo Junior Saga Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Characters in the Smurfs Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Garfield Menstrual cup Pottery Professional wrestling holds Textile manufacturing Hamster Sin City Sento Diving RuneScape quests Bird Mattress The Inside Social rule Horse Urinary incontinence Donald Neilson Mouse (computing) Handloading Professional wrestling throws Hypoglycemia Capercaillie Japanese tea ceremony Thermoregulation Plastic Dog Milton H.

what should i do if my budgies nest does not have concave bottom inside it is better if the nest floor is concave but its not mandatory i am unable to tell whether or not the budgies have begun nesting or if you just bought the nest and are asking about it before you give it to the birds to try out if you find that the hen is unable to incubate all of the eggs then you will need to try and hollow out the nest floor yourself but obviously you can't do it if she has already laid eggs and started sitting on them if that is the case then just let her go ahead and incubate as best she can and maybe she will manage to hatch them out anyway if not you should take the next down take the bottom out of the nest and with a knife rough sand paper or some type of power tool like maybe a dremel hollow out an aread about inches in circumference then put the box back up and put in the nesting material as far as next material goes you can put pine bedding about inch thick on the next bottom and the hen will arrange it to her liking mind you she may even throw some of it out if you prefer there is also a recycled paper bedding that is safe to use which can also be found at pet stores either one works its just a matter of which you or your bird prefer have you thought about what you will do with the chicks do you have a pet store or friends that you can sell them to also you should get a book about budgie breeding and find out more about how to give your parent birds the proper nutrition to raise healthy chicks if you want to look at some of my previousl answers click on my picture and you will see my profile below the profile on the left you will see a tab called my answers and i think you will be able to click on some of the other questions that i have answered that related to budgies and breeding good luck  Chicken Hamster Kakapo Mattress Albatross Egg (food) Capercaillie Budgerigar Peregrine Falcon Fancy rat Platypus Egg (biology) Ostrich Ant Guinea pig Emu Equine conformation Archery Black-footed Albatross Domesticated turkey Condor Opportunity rover Japanese tea ceremony Teen Girl Squad Strap-on dildo Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rhea (bird) House Sparrow Nile crocodile Osprey Diseases of the honeybee Mallard Gaia Online Ivory-billed Woodpecker Casting Brolga Gramophone record Bobwhite Quail Jumpstart 3rd Grade Kagu Kodocha Cockatiel Flea Vermicompost Leatherback Sea Turtle Volleyball Seabird Animal communication Drill bit Red-cockaded Woodpecker Textile manufacturing Minor Harry Potter Beasts American Robin Compact audio cassette Musk Duck Emperor Penguin Brewery Quotation mark Non-human animal sexuality Friends Stairway American Alligator Anchor Common Pheasant Kiwi Sooty albatross Floppy disk Kea Thermal power station Budgie (band) Ocean's Twelve Factory farming Malleefowl RuneScape quests Christmas tree Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Garfield Mound-builders Knife Laysan Albatross Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Curling Ammunition Tooth enamel Channel-billed Toucan Zerg Canary Live-bearing aquarium fish God Emperor of Dune Maxilla Lens (optics) The Ark in Space MapleStory Spoonbill Beehive (beekeeping) Eggerland series

i think my pet birds are fighting a little worried when i was cleaning out their cage and say that they had both lost a feather from their tails which used to be much longer i think they are fighting is this bad and does anyone have any suggestions on what i could do or what this means the a mini parokee's i believe one is a male and the other is a female one of the main reasons why i feel like they were fighting is because when one goes to feed the other makes noises at it and tries to keep it from eating it will sit on top of the food or even try to eat out of the same one at the same time i placed feeding trays in the cage why are they figghting i also got the birds weeks apart so how long have they been together you can always rule the possibility that one of the birds is just a brat i went to the pet store the other day and one blue bird was fighting with all the others birds are just like humans some are simply jerks as far as the feather it depends where you live it could be shedding my birds went through it about a month or two ago but yours could be somewhat different which bird seems to be the most aggressive the one you had first or the other if it is the first one i would guess because it feels like it is rightfully its home and the other bird is intruding try letting them out of their cage as much as you can i have noticed it reduces the fighting of my two birds it helps them get their energy out  Bird Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Hamster Dog Breastfeeding Dairy Kakapo Guinea pig Cat Mealy Parrot Tyrannosaurus rex American Alligator Seabird Canary Capercaillie Ferret Moult House Mouse Tarantula Ostrich Albatross Dog training Falconry Livestock Tooth enamel Nile crocodile American lobster John Cage Bird migration Color Red Squirrel RuneScape quests Airport Fasting Gray Wolf Thermoregulation Textile manufacturing Social rule Minor Harry Potter Beasts Garfield Animal communication Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mattress IPod The Birds (film) Emu Egg (food) Deluge (mythology) Spider One Piece minor characters The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Flea Species The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Ron Weasley Hedgehog Blue Jay Stomach cancer Tasmanian Devil Budgerigar Devil Fruit Acne Animal Orca Professional wrestling match types Sesshomaru Kodocha Poker jargon Bird flight Mosquito Trapping House Koala Nutrition Pet skunk Scarlet Macaw Rufous Hummingbird Archaeopteryx Internet troll House Sparrow Bat Eye African Grey Parrot Piccolo Junior Saga Creatures in Bionicle Shark Penguin Password Breath of Fire III Mountain Gorilla Dinosaur Sexual dimorphism Clownfish Leonard Cohen Kashrut American Eskimo Dog Squirrel Sesame Street
